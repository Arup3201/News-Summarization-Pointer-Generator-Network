Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers praised Jordan Henderson after the midfielder's second goal in as many games helped set the side on their way to a 2-0 win over Burnley.

Henderson, standing in as captain for Steven Gerrard as he works his way back to fitness from a hamstring injury, opened the scoring just before the half-hour with a neatly-taken strike and then provided the cross for Daniel Sturridge's header early in the second half.

'It was a great strike and that gave us greater confidence in the game and his ball for the second goal was terrific,' said Rodgers.

'He has great technique and precision and it was a great finish by Daniel.

'He is improving all the time and as he matures even more tactically he will become even better.

'He has always had athleticism, he is born with a natural gift to run, and tactically he is improving all the time and his passing is improving and he is becoming one of the real leaders of this team.

'It was a wonderful performance by him and the team in general.

'We controlled the tempo of the game and whatever we had to deal with defensively we did.

'As good as the performance was at the weekend (a 2-1 win over Manchester City) this was equally as good.'

Rodgers also had praise for Emre Can, who began the match as one of three centre-backs but, not for the first time in recent weeks, moved into midfield late in the second half.

The Germany Under-21 international had a tough start to his first season in the Premier League but since coming into the team on Boxing Day, coincidentally at Burnley, has been nothing short of superb.

'I look at him and I think if you give him another couple of years he could play in any team in world football - that is how highly I rate him,' added the Reds boss.

'Whether he is central or wide you can see his football intelligence, he breaks through lines with his power and pace and he has great composure.

'The crowd love him because he does the dirty work as well. I really think he will develop into a real world-class player.'

Burnley boss Sean Dyche had no complaints about the result, which leaves his side next-bottom three points from safety.

Rodgers also revealed how highly he rates summer signing Emre Can, who played in defence again

'They (Liverpool) were very good tonight. They are an expensively-assembled side with top-class players who have found that run of form and belief,' he said.

'At 1-0 you never know but second half we gave away a really poor goal - the first one can happen with high-quality players.

'It is a different side to the one we played on Boxing Day. They are right in the zone and high on confidence.

'It is possibly too late for this season but if they carry on that you have to fancy they will be up there (challenging for the title) next season.

'We knew it would be a stern task to come here tonight to get a win but we keep learning. We have a 10-day window to put it back together.

'We will be relentless all the way down the line.'
