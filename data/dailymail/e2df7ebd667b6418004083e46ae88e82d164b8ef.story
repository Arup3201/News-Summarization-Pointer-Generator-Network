It was Australia's most expensive penthouse, a high-rise paradise with its own pool, luxury fittings and a massive stainless steel barbeque that sold off the plan in 2006 for almost $17 million.

Now, it's an empty shell after a deal to sell to one of Australia's richest men fell through and receivers were brought in following a legal dispute.

And the massive four-floor apartment has been stripped of every piece of furniture, every fitting, the walls ceiling - and yes, even the kitchen sink - in an effort to attract a new buyer who can stamp their personality on the Gold Coast property.

'Aurora - The Soul Penthouse' on the glitzy Gold Coast is ready to get a glamorous makeover again, after being stripped bare. Just about every mod-con is long gone ahead of the international auction planned for next month.

If you have the cash, here's your chance to start form the ground up, high above the ground. McGrath Broadbeach selling agent James Ledgerwood says the 'blank canvas' is the new appeal of this four-level 1,040 square metre property.

'It is very, very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want, particularly here on the Gold Coast,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Gutted. The living area is unrecognisable from its once grand appearance, all fittings and furnishings have been removed, even exposing the air conditioning unit - the incredible 360 view of the Gold Coast, though, is still the same 

The previous fit-out is long gone as the Soul Penthouse prepares to go under the hammer

He and co-partner John Natoli were brought in, with a clear brief, take whatever measures are needed to sell it. 

They took one look at the apartment which set a record when sold at $16.85m in 2006 and decided to get rid of the old fit-out

'Look, we had to admit that it (the fit-out) that was there was not very appealing, so we decided that it needed to be ripped up.' 

Yesterday: 'There's not much left from how we found it,' James Ledgerwood admitted. The interior as shown in a catalogue is in stark contrast to what is there today awaiting a big buyer's personal touch

Today: The bare bones living area. 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse, so we began by stripping it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floors and the kitchen too' Mr Ledgerwood of selling agents McGrath told Daily Mail Australia

'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse, so we began by stripping it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floor and the kitchen too,' Mr Ledgerwood added.

The Soul Penthouse starts on level 70 and winds its way up four levels.

'There's not much left from how we found it,' he said.

Mr Ledgerwood said that the auction, will be held for receivers PricewaterhouseCoopers and is set to happen March 7.

'There has been plenty of local and international interest.' 

All cupboards and fixtures have been removed from the 'old Aurora'. It's been gutted after the $17 million sale fell through. The stripped version goes under the hammer in March. Now the appeal is that buyers will have a 'blank canvas' to work with

McGrath Broadbeach selling agent James Ledgerwood. He says the new appeal of this four-level 1040 square metre property 'is that it is very, very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want, particularly here on the Gold Coast'

Development company Juniper Property Holdings has been locked in a bitter legal battle with one of Australia's richest men, Charlie Caltabiano, who is believed to have agreed to purchase the property in 2006 for the then record price of $16.85million.

That agreement to purchase expired last year and the group has sought to keep the $1.685 million deposit along with a further $3.8 million in interest plus damages.

Mr Caltabiano, however, is fighting the claims, alleging misrepresentation.

As it once was. The luxurious pool-side look (above) has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version (below) shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else

'This is the first time I can remember where a penthouse like this is available, be it on the (Gold) Coast or not, where buyers can start with a blank canvas in an already complete and amazing building,' said Mr Ledgerwood.

It may well have been stripped back - but the penthouse has plenty of appeal, he said.

That includes:

It's position at more than 220 metres above the ground, four levels (70-73), boasting 'the highest swimming pool and spa in Queensland', no less than eight secure basement car spaces (which have also had fittings removed) and 'full resort facilities including pools, gym and gardens'.

'This will give them (buyers) the opportunity to create their own vision and take advantage of some of the most spectacular views in Australia, and create a residence of world-class standing.' he said.

At least the BBQ is still in place. One of the biggest talking points all along for the Soul Penthouse has been the swimming pool and spa area, the highest of their kind anywhere in Queensland

Eight car spaces are provided down below and even that area has been cleared out ahead of the auction

'You have spectacular views - out to the Hinterland to the west, you look east out to the ocean, then up to Stradbroke (Island) in the north and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice.' 

The successful bidders will get plenty of input on how to do justice to the prime position.

'The three parties we've commissioned have worldwide experience in working with buyers who own iconic locations,' said Mr Natoli in reference to firms DBI (the original designer), Blainey North and Bayden Goddard Design. 

These groups have been brought in to come up with alternative lay-outs for potential buyers, he said.

'The three companies have provided us with their vision for the penthouse's future look.' 

Dream views. 'You look up to Stradbroke (Island) and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice' said Mr Ledgerwood

With views like this, it's little wonder Mr Ledgewood claims 'there has been plenty of local and international interest' about Aurora - the Soul Penthouse on the Gold Coast which has been stripped bare ahead of its auction next month
