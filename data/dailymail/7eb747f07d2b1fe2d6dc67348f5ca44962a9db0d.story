President Obama praised Estonia's digital accomplishments today, joking that he should have called on the country when setting up his administration's troubled health care website.

During a joint press conference in Tallinn on Wednesday with President Ilves of Estonia, Obama called the country a 'vibrant democracy' where independence has been successfully reclaimed after the Cold War. 

The U.S. leader noted in particular the people's easy accessibility to their government - with each Estonian able to use a 'digital ID' to access public records online.

President Obama joked during a joint press conference  on Wednesday in Tallinn that he needed Estonia's help with healthcare.gov

Obama said: 'Estonians can use their smart phones to get just about anything done online - from their children's grades to their health records. 

'I should have called the Estonians when we were setting up our health care website.' 

Healthcare.gov has been plagued with problems since its launch last fall. Last month, MailOnline discovered 13 web pages on the site which held Latin-language filler text used by web designers instead of important details about health coverage.

And in July, 11 out of 12 'secret shoppers' on the health care exchange were able to obtain coverage and subsidies using fake information.  

Federal investigators from the Government Accountability Office posing as prospective Obamacare applicants were able to successfully enroll in the federal marketplace over the phone and online by providing fictitious Social Security Numbers and proof of income.

Since 2002, Estonia has had a mandatory, national ID card system which allows citizens digital access to secure e-services including government databases to check medical records and file taxes, i-voting and pre-paying for travel tickets.

Each indvidual's online records is protected by a complex key encryption, according to                   e-estonia.com. Nine out of ten of Estonia's 1.3million residents have signed up to the ID cards. 

Three co-founders of Skype, the free online voice and messaging service, are from Estonia - Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu and Jaan Tallin.

Along with Janus Friis, from Denmark, and Niklas Zennström, from Sweden they provided the backend of the company, which sold to Microsoft in 2011 for $8.5billion. 

Although the company is based in Luxembourg, almost half of the employees remain in Tallinn and Tartu, Estonia.

Obama arrived in Estonia on Wednesday morning as part of a three-day trip set to reassure the country and others in the region that were once under Soviet control, who have been warily eyeing Putin's aggression in Ukraine and fear he could set his sights on their nations next.

Unlike Ukraine, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are NATO members, and have been seeking firm commitments that the U.S. and other alliance powers would come to their defense if Russia were to encroach on their territory. 

Following a meeting with the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Obama declared that the U.S. commitment to security of NATO's newest members runs deep. 

Obama is the second sitting American president to visit Estonia, following President George W. Bush, who traveled here in 2006. 

Upon his arrival, Obama wrote in a guest book that it was an honor to visit 'a nation that shows what free people can achieve together.'

The Baltics were invaded by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany during World War II. After the Soviet Union crumbled, the Baltic countries turned to the West and joined the European Union and NATO in 2004, much to the chagrin of Russia.

Say what? The Obama administration's Healthcare.gov has been glitch-prone since its launch, with users encountering Latin-language filler text used by web designers in August
