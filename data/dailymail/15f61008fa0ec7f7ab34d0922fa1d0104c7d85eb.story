When this cat found himself in a spot of bother, help was on hand from an unlikely source. 

As the cat frantically tried to pull a paper cup off its head by wheeling round in circles, a dog trotted on to the scene and came to the rescue. 

The dog approached the distressed cat and removed the cup with its jaw, setting it free.

The two animals then go their separate ways, with the clearly relieved cat the last shot in the clip. 

More than 100,000 have watched the video since it was uploaded to YouTube. 

The footage left viewers perplexed as the animals put aside their age-old hostilities. 

One commentator said: 'I love how the cat casually goes back to whatever it was doing like nothing had happened.'

Others suggested the dog simply wanted the paper cup.
