 Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, has pleaded guilty to a single felony for making an interstate threat against the life of former Ferguson, Mo., police Officer Darren Wilson and his family

An ISIS sympathizer in Washington state has pleaded guilty to a single felony for making an interstate threat against the life of former Ferguson, Missouri, police Officer Darren Wilson and his family.

Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, entered the plea on Monday morning in Seattle. Two other counts are set to be dismissed at sentencing, which is set for June 12.

Abdul-Jabbaar had been detained in custody since his arrest on December 2, but will now be released under supervision until his next court appearance.

If convicted, the father-of-three faces a maximum of five years in prison.

Abdul-Jabbaar started writing the messages immediately after Wilson shot Michael Brown dead last August.

'We need to kill this white motha f***a and anything that has a badge on,’ he wrote on Facebook, where he displayed an ISIS flag as his cover photo.

In addition to specific social media threats, he is also accused of trying to acquire a firearm to act out his desire as spokesman of 'the oppressed' who 'need to kill this white cop.'

In one threat that dates from November 24, the day the grand jury declined to charge Wilson, Abdul-Jabbaar uploaded a photograph of the officer to his Facebook page with the message, 'Ready to go and kill some cops.'

He followed that up later in the day with, 'We need to kill this white motha F***a and anything that has a badge on.'

Murderous support: Abdul-Jabbaar displayed the flag of ISIS on his Facebook page - onto which he posted chilling threats towards Officer Darren Wilson 

Threats: Abdul-Jabbaar is accused of posting a string of threats to his personal Facebook page targeting police officers, specifically Wilson. The criminal complaint quoted one of the postings as saying: 'We the oppressed people need to kill this white cop'

The next day there was a cartoon depicting a black man killing a white officer, with the message: 'We black folks should've been doing this to the police last night.'

In a November 11 Facebook post Abdul-Jabbaar wrote, 'Are there any REAL BLACK MEN that would love to go down to Ferguson Missouri to give back those bullets that [Wilson] fired into the body of Mike Brown.'

The message ends, 'If we're unable to locate [Wilson] then We'll return them to his wife and if not her then his children.'

In other, shocking posts to his Facebook page, Abdul-Jabbaar says that he 'would love to smoke a white motha f***'n cop.'

Born William Cox, Abdul-Jabbaar changed his name in 1990 after converting to Islam and has been divorced several times.

He has several prior convictions, including selling crack cocaine, domestic violence, weapons possession and assault.

In addition to specific social media threats, he is also accused of trying to acquire a firearm to act out his desire as spokesman of 'the oppressed' who 'need to kill this white cop'

Abdul-Jabbaar was also once found guilty of drugging and having 'indecent contact' with an underage girl who was suffering mental illness.

His last appearance in a court came in 2008 when he was sentenced to a year in prison following a gunfight with another man.

A sealed court document contends that Abdul-Jabbaar's sentenced may have been lessened by his cooperation with federal authorities in giving evidence against two al-Qaeda operatives who opened a training camp in Oregon in 1997.

While Abdul-Jabbaar had no involvement with the camp, his attorney at the time said that his client wanted to help authorities in their case against the two men who are now in custody. 

Discoverd: Federal prosecutors said Abdul-Jabbaar's online postings went beyond free and protected speech

Action: Defendant Jaleel Tarik Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, of Kirkland began posting threats on Facebook soon after the shooting of Michael Brown, according to the criminal complaint.

Shocking: Federal prosecutors said Abdul-Jabbaar posted inflammatory messages for months that called on others to join him on a trip to Ferguson to 'give back the bullets' that were fired at Brown
