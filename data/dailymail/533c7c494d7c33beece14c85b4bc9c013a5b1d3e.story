Spared jail: Police constable James Kiddie, 45, was caught on camera punching a suspected woman shoplifter three times in the head

A policeman was caught on CCTV repeatedly punching a suspected woman shoplifter in the head.

James Kiddie attacked Sarah Reed after she was detained by security staff at Uniqlo in Regent Street, London.

But despite being convicted of assault yesterday the 45-year-old constable escaped with just a community order.

The
 shocking camera footage shows the married father-of-two grabbing his 
30-year-old victim by the hair and lifting her out of a chair, while another camera captured him punching her three times as she lay in a corridor trying to shield herself.

Kiddie was convicted of assault last month and was today sentenced to a 12 month community order, requiring him to undertake 150 hours of unpaid work.

The father-of two had been called to the Uniqlo branch, after Ms Reed was held by security guards in November 2012, the court heard.

CCTV footage showed him removing his overcoat and jacket before searching the woman's handbag.

He was then seen forcing her back into a chair, before appearing to grab her hair with both hands, ripping off her hat and dragging her to the floor.

The pictures show him hitting her on the head as she lay on the ground, before leaning on her neck until back-up arrived.

Kiddie claimed Ms Reed, a drug user, had bitten him after telling him she was infected with the AIDS virus.

During the trial last month Kiddie had told the court that his strikes against Ms Reed were 'half power' and he had not wanted to hit her.

He had claimed the woman was ‘snarling like a dog’ and bit him after telling him ‘I’ve got AIDS and I bite tramps like you.’

Pointing to the CCTV footage, Kiddie had said: ‘She is now biting into my index finger and she’s telling me she’s got the AIDS virus.’

‘I didn’t want to break a lady’s nose... I didn’t want to hurt her somewhere that is going to damage,’ he said.

Action: He was then seen forcing her back into a chair, before appearing to grab her hair with both hands, ripping off her hat

Guilty: Kiddie was convicted of assault last month following a three day trial

Scotland Yard said fellow officers who
 had viewed the CCTV footage had been concerned by the level of force 
used by Kiddie during the arrest and had reported the incident to the 
Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS).

Prosecutor
 Rupert Kent told the court that Kiddie had no previous convictions, but
 the Met officer had two previous disciplinary findings of 'incivility' 
against him on his police record.

He was investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission for deploying CS Gas during a UK Uncut protest on Oxford Street in January 2011.

Mr Kent also pointed out that it was Ms Reed who was initially charged with assault upon her attacker.

His defence counsel, Ben Brandon, told 
the court he would be dismissed from the Metropolitan Police as a result
 of the court’s findings.

Mr Brandon said the punches aimed by Kiddie had lasted a 'split second' and only one, in effect, had 'really made contact'.

He said being bitten had come as a 'complete shock' to Kiddie.

He added that Kiddie had spent 12 years in the Met 'serving the people of London' and now faced losing his job.

‘Twelve years as a police officer gone in an instant - as a result of a momentary lapse of control,' said Mr Brandon.

Call out: The father-of two had been called to the Uniqlo branch, after Ms Reed was held by security guards in November 2012

Worry: Scotland Yard said fellow officers who had viewed the CCTV footage had been concerned by the level of force used by Kiddie during the arrest

Impact: The woman is then dragged to the floor

He added: ‘The punches were in anger, a retaliation for the pain caused by the bite.

Kiddie was told by District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe that Ms Reed was a woman who had 'used violence in similar circumstances to avoid the consequences of her own actions and her dishonesty'.

She added: 'This was no shrinking violet, this woman, but, as a police officer, obviously higher standards are required from you.

'I do accept, as I say, that this was an incident of loss of control. There is no pre-meditation.'

Judge Roscoe, sentencing Kiddie to a 150-hour community order, said she accepted that his actions had been 'an instinctive and immediate retaliation in anger.'

She added that evidence on CCTV and of witnesses was that Ms Reed - described in court as a drug addict who was later convicted of shoplifting - was a 'difficult' and 'aggressive' woman who had become more aggressive when the police officer arrived.

Kiddie, attached to Westminster borough, was found guilty of common assault by Judge Roscoe last month after a three-day trial.

Force: The CCTV pictures show him hitting her on the head as she lay on the ground

Account: Kiddie claimed Ms Reed, a drug user, had bitten him after telling him she was infected with the AIDS virus

Sentence: District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe told Kiddie that Ms Reed was ' no shrinking violet', but that 'as a police officer, obviously higher standards are required from you'

At the hearing today, he was also ordered to pay £500 in prosecution costs, and a £60 victim surcharge.

The judge added that she did not ‘deem’ compensation was appropriate, despite the violent nature of the attack.

Dressed in a blue anorak, white shirt and blue spotted tie, the officer, from Ruislip, west London appeared extremely relieved as he strained to hear from the glass dock.

Speaking after sentence, Ms Reed’s solicitor Victoria Hatton said: ‘Ms Reed was the victim of a brutal attack by a serving police officer, PC James Kiddie, on 26 November 2013 in the detention room at the UniQlo store in Regent Street, London.

‘As seen in the video footage played to the court, PC Kiddie threw Ms Reed to the floor where a lightbulb smashed and caused her to suffer a 2cm laceration to her lower back.

‘This was followed by three powerful strikes aimed at Ms Reed’s head.

Claims Kiddie had said the woman was 'snarling like a dog' and bit him after telling him 'I've got AIDS and I bite tramps like you'

Jeopardy: The court was told that Kiddie had spent 12 years in the Met 'serving the people of London' and now faced losing his job

‘In light of recent media stories of police corruption, the conviction highlights a small step forward in the punishment of police officers who chose to act in this way.

‘It sends an important message to those police officers who are there to protect but instead abuse that power and fail to uphold the rule of law.’

The
 Met's territorial policing assistant commissioner Simon Byrne said: 
'Police officers join the Met to protect and serve the public. Today his
 colleagues will be sickened by what they see.

'Wrong': The Met's territorial policing assistant commissioner Simon Byrne said that Kiddie (pictured) had been held accountable for his behaviour

'Where
 an officer's behaviour falls short of the very high standards that we 
and the public expect of them, then it is only right that they are held 
to account for their actions.

'The
 actions of one officer abusing his position in this way can cast a 
shadow over the thousands of officers who are on duty right now 
demonstrating bravery, compassion, integrity and professionalism.

'Pc
 Kiddie's behaviour that day, which was identified and reported by 
another officer, was wrong. For that he has been held accountable. There
 is no place in the Metropolitan Police Service for officers and staff 
who do not uphold our values.'

The
 Met said in a statement that Pc Kiddie was the subject of two 
substantiated complaints - in 2008 for lack of courtesy and respect and 
in 2011 for discriminatory comments.

He was also due to face a misconduct meeting this month with regard to the discharge of CS gas at a demonstration in January 2011, the Met added. This process will be reviewed following today's hearing.

'Pc Kiddie has been suspended and he will be subject to a special misconduct hearing as soon as the police regulations allow,' the statement said.The Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled last year that Kiddie should face a misconduct hearing following the CS gas incident.

A spokesman said: 'The evidence showed that an officer sprayed protesters at close proximity within a crowded area, in breach of Acpo guidance on the use of CS spray.

'When an officer does that, their decision to use the spray must come under the closest scrutiny.

'Having viewed all the available evidence, the IPCC felt there was insufficient justification for his actions.

'We have now asked the MPS to hold a misconduct meeting for the officer and to review why no paperwork was filled out following use of the spray.'
