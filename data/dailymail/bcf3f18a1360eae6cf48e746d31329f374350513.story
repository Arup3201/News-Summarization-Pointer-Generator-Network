Using modern dating techniques, a Cambridge historian found Henry VIII (pictured) was largely incompatible with any of his wives

Despite chopping off her head after just three years of marriage, Anne Boleyn was the best match for King Henry VIII.

Using modern dating techniques, British historian Elizabeth Norton found the Tudor king was largely incompatible with all of his wives due to his aggressive personality, high levels of neuroticism and lack of compassion.

But second wife Anne Boleyn was best suited to the monarch as they were open with one another, shared similar libidos and both had high levels of energy and ambition.

The second most compatible wife was Anne of Cleves, whose marriage with Henry ended within six months.

Henry and his fourth wife shared a similar level of intelligence and diligence, and remained amicable despite their divorce.

In third place was first wife Catherine of Aragon whose profiling indicates that her relative lack of interest in appearance and athleticism may have caused friction with the sporty king.

Yet their marriage lasted for 23 years before Henry split with the Roman Catholic Church in order to divorce her.

Matchmakers put third wife Jane Seymour in fourth place deeming her not bold and outgoing enough, despite the King saying he felt her his ‘first true wife.’

She died following child birth and a year of marriage, and is the only wife to be buried with Henry VIII.

Fifth wife Kathryn Howard’s mismatched 
libido led to her losing her head, after two years of marriage and she 
was the fifth most incompatible.

And last wife Katherine Parr was considered too intellectual for the king’s tastes and was seen as the least suitable of all six - although she outlived Henry.

The research was carried out by Tudor historian Elizabeth Norton who used the matching profiles of online dating provider eHarmony to rank the compatibility of all the wives.

The historian and author carried out a psychological study of all six wives and Henry VIII himself.

Then compatibility experts scored them on the 29 key personality dimensions needed for a successful relationship, including emotional temperament, social style and relationship skills.

Divorced, beheaded, died: Second wife Anne Boleyn was best suited to the monarch as they were open with one another, shared similar libidos and both had high levels of energy and ambition, according to the research. In third place was first wife Catherine of Aragon, while Jane Seymour was fourth

Divorced, beheaded, survived: The second most compatible wife was Anne of Cleves, whose marriage with Henry ended within six months. Fifth wife Kathryn Howard was the fifth most incompatible, and last wife Katherine Parr was seen as too intellectual for the king's tastes and was seen as the least suitable of all

‘More than 500 years after the birth of Henry VIII historians know more than ever about his complex, larger than life personality, to the point that we’ve been able to investigate his compatibility - or more his lack of compatibility - with each of his wives,' said eHarmony’s Jemima Wade.

‘It’s a shame that there was no eHarmony back in the 16th Century, as we’re confident we could have saved Henry a lot of time and heartache by helping him find long-lasting love with a truly compatible partner who shared his beliefs and outlook on life.’

Oxford and Cambridge graduate Elizabeth Norton added: ‘The results of the study have been fascinating. Henry VIII was a complex character and found lasting love difficult to achieve.

‘It was with Anne Boleyn that he enjoyed his most passionate relationship, with him even writing love letters to her - despite not being a fan of letter writing.

‘The results of the study suggest that he should have given their relationship longer.’

King Henry VIII was known for his six marriages, all of which ended in some sort of tragedy, divorce, or death, but he was also known for other, stranger things.

He was known to self-medicate, even going as far as making his own medicines. A record on a prescription for ulcer treatment in the British Museum reads: 'An Oyntment devised by the kinges Majesty made at Westminster, and devised at Grenwich to take away inflammations and to cease payne and heale ulcers called gray plaster'.

The king was also a musician and composer, owning 78 flutes, 78 recorders, five bagpipes, and has since had his songs covered by Jethro Tull.

He died while heavily in debt, after having such a lavish lifestyle that he spent far, far more than taxes would earn him.

He possessed the largest tapestry collection ever documented, and 6,500 pistols.

While most portraits show him as a slight man, he was actually very large, with one observer calling him 'an absolute monster'.
