Nico Rosberg has fuelled the debate over Lewis Hamilton’s failure to follow team orders during Sunday’s Hungarian Grand Prix by saying his rival’s behaviour was ‘not good’.

Rosberg, the world championship leader, is not the most outspoken driver so his careful criticism of Hamilton is noteworthy.

Speaking as the debate over the rights and wrongs of the incident widened, Rosberg said: ‘Lewis didn’t let me by although he was ordered to, so that’s obviously not good, and we need to discuss that internally.’

Holding station: Lewis Hamilton ignored a team order from the pit wall to let Nico Rosberg through in Hungary

The origins of the dispute lie in the
 eight laps when Rosberg was a place behind Hamilton. The  Brit was 
asked three times by the  Mercedes hierarchy to let his team-mate 
through. That was because Rosberg was on a different strategy that 
could, according to boss Toto Wolff, have allowed him to win. Hamilton 
refused.

The message was 
passed on to Hamilton by his race engineer Peter Bonnington, who was 
conveying the instruction coming from the technical director-cum-team 
principal Paddy Lowe.

In 
similar circumstances last year — in Malaysia — it was Ross Brawn, then 
team principal, who told Rosberg to hold position. His voice came over 
the radio firmly, and Rosberg complied with the instruction even though 
it cost him third place.

The
 incident on Sunday highlights doubts as to whether Lowe and Wolff, who 
is meant to be in charge of the team’s commercial wing but is their 
spokesman on most matters, are providing the right kind of leadership.

It
 is questionable whether Lowe was even right to ask Hamilton to move, 
something he seemed to doubt himself given he did not go on the radio to
 issue the order and withdrew the instruction after the third attempt, 
undermining his authority in the process.

Niki Lauda, Mercedes F1 chairman, admitted they panicked into asking Hamilton to give way.

John
 Watson, a five-time grand prix winner, said: ‘I don’t see anyone at 
Mercedes with the authority, credibility and gravitas that Brawn had. 
Brawn emphatically said: “No. Hold position,” in Malaysia. It is not 
just what you say, it is the way you say it and it is the person who 
says it.

‘Is Toto Wolff 
more interested in projecting himself? Does he really have the 
authority? Paddy Lowe is a fantastic guy, but he is not the person to 
deal with this. Lauda is a very clever man, but I don’t know what 
authority he has. If there was one person who could kick ass in that 
team, it is the person that they let go, Ross.’

Blow: Rosberg was leading Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix until the deployment of the safety car

Mercedes have said they will draw up new guidelines for the rest of the season’s racing, which resumes in Spa on August 24.

Hamilton,
 who trails Rosberg by 11 points, defended his behaviour, saying: ‘It is
 not a matter of questioning authority. I am hired to race and bring in 
points. I am also hired to race my heart out.

‘It
 was just a case of not giving a single point away. I don’t think I was 
being ruthless. I was not even being bloody minded. I did not cost Nico a
 win. I was racing against him. Why would I be  concerned for him?’
