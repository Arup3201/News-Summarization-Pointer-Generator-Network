The mid-20th Century animosity against Germany appears to be long forgotten, as the nation has been voted the world's favourite country.

The U.S. lost the top spot to Germany for the first time in six years, as people from 20 countries were asked to rank others in categories such as Governance, Culture and People.

Angela Merkel and the people of Germany may have their football team to thank for their win, as the polling took place in July this year, days after they won the World Cup.

People around the world now have more positive perceptions of Germany than of 49 other developed and developing countries, according to the annual Anholt-GfK Roper Nation Brands Index (NBI).

'Germany appears to have benefited not only from the sports prowess it displayed on the world stage at the FIFA World Cup championship, but also by solidifying its perceived leadership in Europe through a robust economy and steady political stewardship,' said Simon Anholt, an independent policy advisor.

'Germany’s score gains in the areas of "honest and competent government", "investment climate", and "social equality" are among the largest it achieved across all the aspects covered by the NBI 2014 survey.'

The U.S. has come out on top every year since 2009, but this year lost out to Germany following military interventions across the globe.

While it still is seen as number one in several areas, including creativity, contemporary culture, and educational institutions, its role in global peace and security only ranks 19th out of 50 nations. 

1. Germany

2. United States

3. United Kingdom

4. France

5. Canada

6. Japan

7. Italy

8. Switzerland

9. Australia

10. Sweden

'In a year of various international confrontations, the United States has lost significant ground where tension has been felt the most acutely,' Xiaoyan Zhao, Senior Vice President and Director of Nation Brands Index SM at GfK, said.

'Both Russia and Egypt have downgraded the U.S. in an unprecedented manner, particularly in their perception of American commitment to global peace and security, and in their assessment of the competence of the U.S. government.'

However, on a global level, Russia that has received the strongest criticism from public opinion, and dropped several spots.

For the past ten years, Anholt and GfK have together been measuring the image of  50 countries on23 attributes, separated into six overall categories;  Exports, Governance, Culture, People, Tourism and Immigration/Investment.

For the 2014 study, a total of 20,125 interviews were conducted in 20 countries, with at least 1,000 interviews per country
