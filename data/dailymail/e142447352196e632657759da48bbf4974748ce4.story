A toddler who was the only survivor of a car crash that killed five members of his family on a pilgrimage to Mecca has has attended a memorial service held in their honour.

One-year-old Mohammed Eisa Daniel was hailed a 'miracle baby' after surviving the taxi crash on February 8 on a pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

He lost his parents, grandparents and aunt in the crash that happened when their cab reportedly hit a concrete bridge, somersaulted off the road, and ended up in a ditch.

Shaukat Ali Hayat, 56, his wife Abida, 47, eldest son Mohammed Isshaq, 33, his heavily pregnant wife, Bilques, and daughter Saira Zenub from Newport, South Wales, all died in the accident.

Yesterday more than 1,000 mourners attended a memorial service for the five victims at a mosque in their home town.

The family had been in Saudi Arabia as part of the Umrah, a pilgrimage to Mecca by Muslims at any time of the year.

Only Mohammed Eisa Danial Hayat , who will be two this week, survived.  He was found cradled in his dead grandfather's arms and suffered just a broken arm in the crash thanks to his grandfather protecting him from the impact.

Shaukat's brother Shazda said: 'He is traumatised, he will need lots of counselling.

'When something happens like this always in life be prepared - you don't know what tomorrow has in store.'

The Hayat family were well-known around Newport and mourners turned out in force

MPs Jessica Morden, Paul Flynn, AMs Rosemary Butler and John Griffiths, Newport mayor John Guy and council leader Bob Bright joined the service to pay tribute to the family, who had strong links to the local Labour Party.

Ms Morden described Newport as 'one family that grieves together', while Mrs Butler said everyone in Wales felt 'the sadness that we feel today'.

Mr Flynn said inspiration could be taken from the fact a young child was spared.

Engaged: Saira Zenub Hayat, 29, was due to be married last weekend

Mohammed's aunt Saira Zenub Hayat, 29, who also died in the crash, had been due to get married last weekend.  Moments before the smash, she sent a relative a text message to say she was worried about how fast the taxi was going.

The Hayat family were well-known in their home town of Newport, where Miss Zenub Hayat worked as a pharmacist and her brother Mohammad, the father of the surviving baby, was hoping to do a PhD in neuroscience.

Mohammed's mother Bilques Hayat was seven months pregnant when she died as the family made what should have been a four-hour trip to the city of Jeddah to meet relatives.

All of the victims were buried in a cemetery in Medina shortly after the accident.

The Hayat family had made the 3,000-mile trip to Saudi Arabia because Miss Zenub Hayat was due to be married there.

While they were there, they decided to make the Umrah pilgrimage.
