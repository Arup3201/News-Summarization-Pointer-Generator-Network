In court: Tulisa Contostavlos is charged with helping an undercover reporter obtain 13.9g of cocaine

Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos today made her first appearance at crown court accused of brokering a cocaine deal.

The N-Dubz star, of Friern Barnet, north London, is charged with helping an undercover reporter obtain 13.9g of the Class A drug for £860.

She appeared alongside rapper Mike GLC, also known as Michael Coombs, 35, of Enfield, north London, for a preliminary hearing at Southwark Crown Court in Central London.

Contostavlos, 25, denies being ‘concerned with the supply of 13.9 grams of cocaine’ to The Sun on Sunday's undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, known as the ‘fake sheikh’, between May 20 and May 24. Coombs denies a charge of supplying the drug on May 23.

She was told her trial is expected to take place on July 14 -  the day after her 26th birthday.

Dressed in a black jacket and skirt, she appeared alongside Coombs for a 10-minute preliminary hearing. The pair spoke only to confirm their names and say they understood the current timetable. There will also be a case management hearing on March 27.

Contostavlos allegedly set up the transaction after telling Mr Mahmood she could help provide him with ‘white sweets’, which is claimed to have been code for cocaine.

She is accused of playing a ‘significant role’ of putting the fake sheikh in touch with Coombs before the pair met at the upmarket Dorchester Hotel in Central London.

The Sun on Sunday recorded the meeting in which Coombs is said to have handed over half an ounce of cocaine.

Contostavlos was initially arrested in connection with the incident with Coombs on June 4.

Judge Alistair McCreath gave 
Contostavlos and Coombs the timetable for the case and renewed their 
unconditional bail. The trial is expected to last two weeks.

After
 the hearing, a man thought to be Contostavlos's solicitor read a 
statement to reporters, which said: ‘Today Tulisa appeared at Southwark 
Crown Court in connection with a serious allegation that she has been 
concerned in the supply of drugs.

‘Tulisa
 is not guilty of this, or any other offence, and is looking forward to 
giving her account to a jury. That trial will reveal the full extent of 
the role played by Mazher Mahmood and the Sunday Sun.’

A Sun spokesman said: ‘The Sun on Sunday’s investigation into Tulisa Contostavlos was entirely justified in the public interest. It was undertaken by Mazher Mahmood.

‘Ms Contostavlos is a self-described role model for young people and therefore has certain responsibilities.

‘Throughout our investigation, our team followed the Press Complaints Commission Code and then handed over our dossier of evidence to the police.

‘Following the police investigation, prosecutors have decided that there is a clear case to answer.  It is right that this matter should go to court and be decided by a jury.’
