It sounds like the storyline for an episode of the Simpsons – tearaway Bart goes metal detecting and causes chaos when he brings home an unexploded bomb.

But that is just what his namesake did when he went hunting for treasure near his home.

Bartholomew Simpson, 37, unwittingly came across the Second World War relic encased in mud in while metal detecting in woodland in Benfleet.

Bartholomew Simpson, 37, had to call the police after finding an unexploded bomb in woodland in Benfleet

Mr Simpson was not sure police would take his call seriously, suspecting they might suspect it was a prank

But It was not until he got back to his home in Essex and washed his haul that he discovered the live cannon shell and called the police. 

He said: 'I didn’t know how they would react to a guy phoning to say "Hi, I’m Bart Simpson and I’ve found an explosive".

'The funny thing is I’m not even a fan of The Simpsons.'

Police evacuated Mr Simpson's neighbours in Laindon at 11pm on Sunday and an Army bomb disposal unit was called in.   

He said: ‘I don’t think my neighbours were very impressed about being asked to leave their homes on the coldest night of the year. Still, it was the safest thing to do.'

Mr Simpson said he hadn't realised the object was a bomb, saying: 'I had just put it in my bag and it wasn’t until I began cleaning the things I had found that I realised what it was.

Mr Simpson said he hadn't realised the object was a bomb and put it in a bucket of water outside his house, saying: 'I had just put it in my bag and it wasn’t until I began cleaning the things I had found that I realised what it was'

‘I put it in a bucket of water outside my house and called the police.'

Mr Simpson said had he known the object was a bomb he would have simply 'marked the spot' and called the police.    

Police later sealed off his street while the deadly device was moved to a nearby recycling centre and placed under guard.

It was taken to a farmer’s field the following morning by bomb disposal experts from Colchester Garrison and destroyed in a controlled explosion.

Mr Simpson had been told the 20mm shell probably fell from an RAF fighter 70 years ago.

He said: ‘There were a number of air battles over Essex during the Second World War.

‘This type of shell would have detonated when the red tip was pushed in.

‘On this device, the tip had been partly pushed but it had obviously not detonated.

‘It’s the first time I have ever found anything like this. Usually it’s coins and other items.’

An Army spokesman said the bomb 'still contained explosives'.

The spokesman added: ‘Destroying the shell was the safest thing to do in the circumstances, as old ammunition can be quite unstable.’
