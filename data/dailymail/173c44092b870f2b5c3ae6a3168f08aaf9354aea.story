Beau Biden has defended the judge who decided to let an heir to the du Pont family agree to a plea deal after being charged with sexually abusing his young daughter.

Biden, the Vice President's son who is in his second term as Delaware Attorney General, wrote a letter supporting Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden and her decision to allow Robert H. Richards IV to admit to fourth degree rape and register as a sex offender but not serve any time.

Her decision prompted outrage after she supported the move by writing that the heir, who just turned 48 yesterday, 'would not fare well' in prison.

'This was not a strong case, and a loss at trial was a distinct possibility,' Biden wrote in his letter to The News Journal.

'In recognition of the weakness of the 
case, the assigned prosecutor offered a plea and sentence recommendation
 that guaranteed the defendant would be required to register as a sex 
offender, participate in court-ordered sex offender rehabilitation 
therapy and to have no contact with the victim and any other child under
 the age of 16.

'A loss at trial would have rendered any of these restrictions impossible.'

The ruling was made in 2009 but the case came back to the forefront when Richards' ex-wife Tracy filed a lawsuit to seek damages.

In the suit, she detailed the how Richards allegedly sexually assaulted their daughter four times over the course of nearly two years from the time the girl was 3-years-old.

In her lawsuit, Tracy charges that he 
penetrated his daughter with his fingers while masturbating, and 
subsequently also assaulted his toddler son as well.

It
 has not been revealed how much compensation Tracy Richards is seeking 
from her ex, who is unemployed and living off his trust fund.

He is the great-grandson of Irenee du Pont, the patriarch in the family of chemical barons.

On Sunday, it was revealed that Judge 
Jurden originally sentenced Richards to spend eight years behind bars 
but then substituted the hard time for probation and the other 
stipulations.

Judge Jurden was issued a security detail when activists started threatening her over the case.

Biden argued that in spite of her 
controversial ruling, the judge 'exercised sound discretion based solely
 on the merits of the case before her.'

'The defendant did not make a statement to police, although he made an ambiguous apology to the victim's mother. A conviction would have required 12 jurors to find unanimously, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime had occurred,' Biden wrote.

Richards has never faced any charges relating to the alleged abuse of his son, but is currently on probation for the abuse against his daughter, who is now 11.

The lawsuit claims that he entered her bedroom at night while she slept and penetrated her with his fingers while masturbating, said the lawsuit, which includes documents from the criminal case.

Abuse of the children occurred at both of Richards' homes, including the 5,800-square-foot Greenville, Delaware mansion that he paid $1.8million for.

Richards, who is 6'4 and about 250 
pounds, told the girl 'to keep what he had done to her a secret,' but in
 October 2007 she told her grandmother, who informed Tracy Richards, the
 lawsuit said.

The girl was taken to her pediatrician, whom she told about the abuse, and New Castle County police arrested him that December.

The proven abuse of his daughter and alleged assault of his son has caused his children 'long-term injuries,' the lawsuit filed Tuesday said, perhaps including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sexual dysfunction and shame.

His daughter also has 'repressed memories of some instances of the abuse she suffered,' and if the son was abused, the same is true with him, the suit said.

With medical treatment, the lawsuit said, those memories will likely 'begin to surface.'

'Making matters worse this self-admitted rapist and child abuser has not paid a single penny to these children for his crimes. There is no provision whatsoever for them for their future after they turn 18,' said Attorney Thomas Crumplar, who is representing Tracy Richards.
