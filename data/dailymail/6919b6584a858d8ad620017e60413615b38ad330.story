Was this golf’s biggest-ever collapse? Heck, was this the most shocking capitulation in the long history of sport?

‘Expect the unexpected’ read the banners advertising the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship but no-one expected anything quite so unexpected as what happened on a truly dramatic afternoon in the desert.

The facts are Martin Kaymer birdied three of his first four holes to move 10 shots clear in pursuit of his fourth victory in this event. At that point, Ladbrokes rated him 500-1 on to do what he did at the United States Open last June and march relentlessly to victory.

Unknown Frenchman Gary Stal, ranked 357 in the world, has won the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship

Stal, who shot 65, looked like a man in shock as he was awarded the handsome trophy 

To put that into perspective, AC Milan were merely 100-1 on when they went 3-0 up against Liverpool at half-time in the 2005 Champions League final. This was a racing certainly to rank alongside Devon Loch in that Grand National all those years ago.

And yet Kaymer, with the winning post in sight, collapsed every bit as dramatically as the Queen Mother’s horse. This being golf, though, the agony went on for more than two hours.

‘I am very surprised by what happened and a little shocked,’ said Kaymer. ‘I certainly didn’t think that would happen.’

He wasn’t the only one.

The beneficiary was 22-year-old Frenchman Gary Stal, ranked 357th in the world, who shot 65 and kept his nerve over the closing holes while Kaymer was losing his. He was emotional at the finish, and not just because this was his first win on tour. Stal was on the golf course last May at the BMW PGA Championship when he learned his mother Christine had died from cancer.

Martin Kaymer had seemed certain to win and had a 10-shot lead at one stage on the final day

But Kaymer suffered a monumental collapse and didn't even finish second in the end

After falling eight shots behind Kaymer on Saturday, Rory McIlroy said he was playing for second place, and duly achieved his fourth runner-up finish in this event with a final-round 66. Not in a million years, though, did he think he would be finishing second to Stal.

Kaymer won both the US Open and the Players Championship last year when leading from start to finish, and did the same when achieving his first win in this event in 2008. All that, however, proved no preparation once his swing began to unhinge following a double bogey at the 9th. The pressure was on by the time he got to the 13th and, quite extraordinarily, the man who once had the hopes of a continent on his shoulders and still holed a 6ft putt to win the Ryder Cup found he could not cope.

Just as he had on the 9th, he drove into a bush and had to take a penalty drop. Just as at the 9th he played from a waste area of sand and came up 30 yards short.

We knew he was in trouble by what happened next. Kaymer’s old weakness used to be his chipping and weaknesses invariably show when a player is under the cosh. He caught the turf so far behind the ball it barely travelled a third of the intended distance, and he ended up with a calamitous triple bogey seven.

Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy eventually finished second behind Stal

McIlroy had predicted earlier in the day that he would come second

The man who had reached 23 under par for his first 58 holes had played the next seven in a bewildering six over. Perhaps the only parallel for this in golf was when Arnold Palmer lost a seven-shot lead with nine holes to play in the 1966 US Open.

McIlroy duly seized the moment. He birdied the 13th and the 15th. He knew an eagle was required at the par-five last and found himself needing to hole a bunker shot to achieve it. He played the shot beautifully, but the ball passed agonisingly by the edge of the hole.

‘I thought it had a chance to go in,’ said the world No 1. ‘I don’t think anyone expected Martin to lose his lead but I know as well as anyone what can happen. You make a couple of bad swings and lose confidence and guys behind you start holing putts. Once you lose momentum, it’s hard to get it back.’

Stal was a man in shock long after he was awarded the trophy. ‘What happened seems impossible, but I am very happy to get my first win,’ he said.
