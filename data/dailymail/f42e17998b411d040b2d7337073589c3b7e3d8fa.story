England made cricketing history yesterday with a world record-breaking last wicket stand of 198.

James Anderson and Joe Root’s incredible partnership at Nottingham’s Trent Bridge shattered the previous best of 163 by Australian pair Phil Hughes and Ashton Agar at the same ground last year.

England’s previous best 10th wicket score was in 1903, when Wilfred Rhodes and Reginald Foster – the only man to captain England at cricket and football – put on 130.

James Anderson and Joe Root scored a world record 198 before England lost their 10th wicket. Anderson also scored his maiden test half century, and beat the previous England record for a number 11

Root’s unbeaten innings of 154 and Anderson’s 81 – his maiden Test half century – helped England take a surprise first innings lead against India.

On a day of landmarks, Anderson’s innings surpassed the previous best by an England No 11, the 59 not out made by fast bowler John Snow against the West Indies in 1966.

India’s total featured a record last-wicket stand of their own, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar and last man Mohammed Shami putting on 111. 

The match is also the first time two No 11s have scored 50s in the same Test.
