Pakistan's former president Pervez Musharraf was today charged with murder over the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007.

The move completes the downfall of the man who once dominated his country but was driven out of office and exiled in disgrace.

The decision by a court in Rawalpindi marks the first time any former army chief has been charged with a crime in Pakistan.

Charge: Pervez Musharraf, left, is accused of murder over the death of Benazir Bhutto, right, at a rally in 2007

Musharraf has been charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and facilitation for murder.

The former army commando who took power in a coup in 1999 appeared in person at the hearing and pleaded not guilty to all charges.

The next hearing will take place on August 27, when the first evidence will be presented.

Ms Bhutto was killed in December 2007 during a gun and bomb attack at a political rally in Rawalpindi.

Prosecutors claim that Musharraf, who was then president, failed to protect her properly.

Musharraf, 70, left Pakistan in 2008 after being forced to resign from office, but returned to the country in March and vowed to contest this year's elections.

However, the former leader enjoys little popular support, and has been faced with a host of legal problems dating back to his time in power.

He has been confined to his house on the outskirts of Islamabad, and was brought to court today surrounded by tight security.

In addition to the Bhutto case, Musharraf is involved in a case related to the detention of judges and the death of a separatist leader.

He also faces threats from the Pakistani Taliban, which tried to assassinate him twice while he was in office and vowed to try again if he returned.
