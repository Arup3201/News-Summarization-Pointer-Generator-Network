France wants the UK to pay for a day centre for the illegal immigrants gathered at Calais, says a left-wing French MP.

The suggestion came from Yann Capet who met Bernard Cazeneuve, the Interior Minister, today and suggested a centre should be established in Calais and others nearby.

'The minister was most insistent that there must be British solidarity very concretely and not only in words but also in actions.

'There is no question of the British washing their hands of this problem', said M Capet. 'The English could be incited to take part “financially as well” in the setting up of the Calais day centre and other buildings which would complement it.

'There is also the possibility that the British government will send representatives to Calais to explain the truth to the migrants.’

Last week M Cazeneuve said in an interview published in Calais that he wanted migrants to be told that it was no longer an El Dorado for refugees.

He said he was in favour of day centres where migrants could receive help and advice and be told of their rights in France.

Yann Capet is a political opponent of Natacha Bouchart, the right-wing mayor of Calais. He is also an opposition member of the Calais municipal council.

On Monday he invited the mayor to take part in a joint meeting with the Interior Minister but Mme Bouchart declined.

‘In her turn Madame Bouchart was due to meet the Interior Minister late this afternoon to try to persuade him to give the go ahead for a Sangatte type overnight hostel for 400 migrants which she said her town needs as a matter of urgency,’ he said.

M Cazeneuve has said that he is opposed to a new Sangatte as he fears that it would attract even more migrants to Calais.

Official figures put the current number of migrants sleeping rough in a squat camp dubbed Jungle 2 and in disused buildings in the town at 1,300, but charity groups say the figure is more like 2000 and rising every day.

Transport companies are urging truckers to avoid boarding ferries at Calais following violent incidents between drivers faced with £1,500 fines if illegals are found in their trailers and people smugglers armed with knives, iron bars and in a case last week a pump action shotgun.

Last month, there were violent clashes between Eritreans and Sudanese over territorial rights to spots where it is easy to jump on trucks and attempt to stowaway to Britain.
