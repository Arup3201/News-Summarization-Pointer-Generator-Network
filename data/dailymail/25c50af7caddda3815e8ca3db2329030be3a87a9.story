Feud: The late Poet Laureate's love life is back in the spotlight after a row between a biographer and his widow

He was as renowned for his tempestuous relationships as he was for his award-winning poetry.

And Ted Hughes's extraordinary love life is once again in the spotlight after a row between his widow and an academic planning a no holds barred biography.

Jonathan Bate, an English professor at Oxford, has worked for four years on a book about the poet after being given access to Hughes's journals, diaries and unpublished poems.

He has since been banned from looking at any more documents by the poet's widow Carol Hughes after uncovering new material about a series of affairs and his turbulent relationship with his first wife Sylvia Plath, a fellow poet who committed suicide in 1963.

Mrs Hughes has also requested he now return any photocopies he has made of documents held in an American archive.

Mr Bate yesterday spoke of his anger about the project being sabotaged.

'It makes me wonder if there is some secret being guarded,' he told the Sunday Times.

'Of course I would have to make some references to his love life, but that itself was so important to his poetry. The point is that everything he did in a remarkable life fed into his writing.' The biography Professor Bate has been working on was never officially authorised but Mrs Hughes gave her blessing and initially allowed him access to archives on condition that personal revelations were only used to inform understanding of the poet's works.

She has since reneged on permission she granted for him to photocopy material from the Hughes archive in the British Library, which bought the collection from her in 2008 for Â£500,000.

Mr Bate discovered new material about his scrutinised relationship with Plath, including an unpublished poem which reveals how he tried to reconcile their relationship over a romantic dinner in Soho shortly before she killed herself.

Hughes was subsequently blamed for his wife's death.

The poet later had a relationship with German Assia Wevill, who also committed suicide.

In 1970, he then married Carol Orchard but took mistresses including novelist Emma Tennant, Australian Jill Barber and Brenda Heddon, a social worker from Devon.

Professor Bate's biography was commissioned by Faber & Faber but is not expected to be published next year by rival HarperCollins.

An employee at Faber & Faber - Hughes's former publisher - said of the poet's appetite for women: 'He was insatiable. He'd come in the office and seek women. He had tremendous sexual presence too. Carol, who is a very nice and steady person, put up with the affairs but never knew the full extent.'
