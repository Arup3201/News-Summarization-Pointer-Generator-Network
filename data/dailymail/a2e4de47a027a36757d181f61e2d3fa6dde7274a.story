Would-be killer: UCF student James Oliver Seevakumaran was planning a campus killing spree before killing himself, cops said

A student at the University of Central Florida student has been hailed a hero for his role in preventing a mass shooting by his roommate, who killed himself instead of putting his plan into action.

Arabo 'BK' Babakhani says that he was the man who called 911 to report a gunman in a dorm room after his roommate, James Oliver Seevakumaran had just pulled a fire alarm, and raised a gun to Babakhani's face just after midnight on Monday.

At a press conference on Monday evening, UCF Police Chief Richard Beary said that Babakhani's call, combined with the quick response time of UCF officers, 'may have changed [Seevakumaran's] ability to think quickly on his feet.'

Pulling the fire alarm was the first step of an elaborate campus massacre plot by Seevakumaran, police have said, but as officers approached, he shot himself in the head in his bedroom.

There, cops found Seevakumaran's body, two guns, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and a backpack filled with improvised explosives.

Babakhani told the UCF student newspaper Knightly News that he darted into his bedroom and called 911.

He told the paper: 'I got away from the door in case he barred into it. I crouched in front of my chair in case he fired into the door. I crouched in front of my chest of [drawers] in case he fired into a wall... I just didnt know where he was gonna fire.'

Babakhani also described Seevakumaran as a loner, and said isn't sure he and his roommate ever locked eyes before pointing an assault rifle at him.

He told the paper: 'I don’t know if he’s got any family. I've never heard him talk on his cell phone or I don't know if he’s got any family. I don’t know if he’s got any friends cause I've never seen them.'

Babakhani added in the interview: 'For Thanksgiving... he didn't invite anyone. He just cooked a whole Thanksgiving meal for himself.'

As police investigated, they found writings in Seevakumaran's room that detailed a plan of attack.

A list found along with his dead body included getting drunk at a bar near campus before pulling the fire alarm.

Beary says the final item was 'give them hell.'

About 500 students were evacuated from the dorm on the Orlando campus after the fire alarm was pulled at about 12:21am, Beary said.

Beary added that Seevakumaran had not 
yet paid his school fees for this semester, and a process had begun to 
kick him out of the dorm.

He
had no prior disciplinary record at UCF, but he was arrested in 2006 
for misuse of a temporary tag and driving with a suspended license.

His
writings indicated that he had been planning the attack since February,
and he had bought his weapons in an Orlando-area gunshop, police said.

More details emerged Tuesday about Seevakumaran's solitary lifestyle.

Seevakumaran's family said he was a loner who didn't have a history of violence in a brief statement released by authorities.

Beary told the news conference that he acted alone and didn't have any friends.

'He didn't like to talk to people,' Beary said.

UCF spokesman Grant Heston
said the Orange County Sheriff's Office and the FBI are helping with the investigation.

Just after noon on Monday, the explosives were removed from the dorm and classes resumed as scheduled.

The school utilized text message alerts to keep students informed about the situation.

Antonio Whitehead, 21, a junior from 
Hollywood, Florida, said he heard the fire alarm go off after midnight 
and thought it was a routine alarm.

He headed outside where he saw a crowd already heading across the street from the dorm.

'All
of a sudden, I felt the crowd move a little faster. And a police 
officer with a machine gun or something told everyone to start moving a 
lot faster,' he said.

Whitehead, who has lived in the dorm 
for two years, said the students were moved to an open area about 1,000 
feet from UCF Arena.

Grant 
Hernandez, 20, a sophomore from Orlando who also is a resident at the 
dorm, said he woke up sometime after midnight when police were 
evacuating the building.

'We weren't allowed to get our cars. We weren't allowed to get our personal effects,' Hernandez said.

'All we saw were people running, and they were not telling us what was going on,' he added.

'We were left unsure of things. It wasn't till about 6 o'clock that we got more information and a clearer picture of what was going on.'

He said officers on the scene began providing more information, and students checked updates on the university's website.

The area is a very busy section of the campus, with restaurants and shops nearby.

A statement on the university's website said the UCF Arena would open to accommodate displaced students. 

Counselors would be available to talk to students who need assistance.
