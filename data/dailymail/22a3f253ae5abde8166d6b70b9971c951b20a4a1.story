Guinness World Records says the former musician and coal miner 
certified as the world's oldest man has died.

Salustiano 
Sanchez-Blazquez was 112.

Guinness consultant Robert Young says Sanchez-Blazquez died Friday at a nursing home in Grand Island, N.Y.

Nicknamed "Shorty," Sanchez-Blazquez became the world's oldest man when Jiroemon Kimura died in June at age 116.

Sanchez-Blazquez was born June 8, 1901, in the village of El Tejado 
de Bejar, Spain. He moved to Cuba at 17, then to the United States in 
1920 where he worked the coal mines of Lynch, Ky. He eventually moved to
the Niagara Falls area.

He had two children, seven grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.

Sanchez-Blazquez, nicknamed 'Shorty', said a daily intake of bananas and six Anacin tablets contributed to his longevity.

'I'm an old man and let's leave it at that,' the self-taught musician, coal miner and gin rummy aficionado  said in a statement to Guinness World Records in June.

Sanchez-Blazquez, a great-great-grandfather, said he was humbled by the attention, 
but he didn't feel he accomplished anything special just because he 
has lived longer than most.

But Robert Young, senior gerontology 
consultant with Guinness World Records, said 90 percent of all 
supercentenarians are female and Salustiano was the only male 
born in 1901 with proof of birth.

Guinness World Records used census reports, immigration papers, marriage records and news reports to confirm the record.

The world's oldest person is a woman, 115-year-old Misao Okawa of Japan.Â 

The oldest authenticated person was Jeanne Louise Calment of France, who died at the age of 122 years and 164 days.

Sanchez-Blazquez was born on June 8, 1901, in village of El Tejado de Bejar, Spain.

He was known for his talent on the dulzania, a double-reed wind instrument that he taught himself and played at weddings and village celebrations.

At 17, he moved with his older brother Pedro and a group of friends to Cuba, where they worked in the cane fields.

In 1920, he moved to the U.S. via Ellis Island and worked in the coal mines of Lynch, Kentucky.

He eventually moved to the Niagara Falls area of New York, where he still lives, working in construction and in the industrial furnaces.

He married his wife, Pearl, in 1934.

When she died in 1988, he lived with his daughter Irene Johnson, 69, before moving into a nursing home in 2007.

Grand Island's Johnson offered her own theory for her dad's staying power: 'I think it's just because he's an independent, stubborn man.'

Sanchez-Blazquez has a daughter, a 76-year-old son, John, seven grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.
