An incredible free-runner has completed the world's most notorious equestrian cross country course at Badminton Horse Trials on foot.

Mat Armitage managed to complete the entire course - beating royal equestrian Zara Phillips, who crashed out of the event part-way round on Sunday.

The free runner, originally from the Wirral, Merseyside, was challenged to jump the course by his girlfriend, event rider Amy Williams.

Free runner Mat Armitage clears a jump on the cross country course at Badminton Horse Trials

The 22-year-old was dared by his girlfriend, an event rider, to complete the course on foot

Mr Armitage successfully cleared every jump that was open to the public - 28 out of 30 - on the course

But even she was impressed when he managed to make it round 28 of the course fences - which are up to 4'9" high and can be 6' 6" wide - without the aid of a horse.

Mr Armitage, 22, covered every jump that was open for members of the public to walk around on the final day of the three-day event, on Monday - including the notorious fences in Badminton's famous lake.

The amazing video shows Mat clearing the double brush fence in the water on the course in Badminton, Gloucestershire, with ease.

It is the exact same spot where Zara was forced to retire from the competition after her horse, High Kingdom, crashed into a fence flag.Â

Mr Armitage's score for the course would have been higher than that of Zara Phillips

But the course took the free runner almost four hours, far longer than the 11 minute 13 second limit

Mr Armitage has been free running since he was in high school and is now a professional

Despite clearing all the fences, the free runner, who lives in Basingstoke, Hampshire, was considerably over the 11 minute 13 second time limit - taking almost four hours to complete the 6km course.

Mr Armitage, who is a professional free runner with 3RUN, said: 'I have been free running for almost eight years now, and this was one of the toughest courses I've run.

'I got into running when I was at high school because all my friends were doing it, and discovered I was pretty good at it.

'I have run in all kinds of places, mostly urban, in the past, but my girlfriend suggested I should try some of the Badminton jumps.'

Mr Armitage carefully counted the steps he needed for his run-up to each jump to ensure he cleared it

He added: 'On the last day of the competition, 
the public were free to walk around 28 out of the 30 jumps from the 
cross country course, so I thought I'd give it a go.

'It
was a lot more difficult than it looked. I had to count out my strides 
up to each fence, the same way a horse and rider would, to make sure I 
made it over.

'The fences are much bigger up close than they appear when you see them on the TV, and I did struggle with a couple of them.

'My girlfriend still thinks it's more difficult to get round on a horse - but I'd disagree.'

Mr Armitage filmed his four-hour journey around the Badminton cross country course

The free runner cleared all the jumps which are up to 4'9" high and can be 6' 6" wide
