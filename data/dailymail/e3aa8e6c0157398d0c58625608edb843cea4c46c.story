The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) is on a mission to record the flocks of migrating birds at a nature reserve in Rye, East Sussex.

At the centre of the project is the Hirundine family which consist of Sand Martins, House Martins and Swallows.

All these species roost in high numbers on the reserve over summer before continuing their migratory route back to Africa.

Delicate job: After a night catching Sand Martins, volunteer Pete Carr collects other migrating birds at first light

Sand Martin is caught in a mist net as it came in to roost on a private reserve

A warbler hangs in a mist net put up by ornithologist so they can measure it before releasing it to continue its migration to Africa

Another warbler is caught by experts studying the migratory birds on a reserve in East Sussex

Up close and personal: A Chiffchaff is examined and it's measurements recorded

Volunteer Stuart Will, who manages a local factory that manufacture bird rings holds a nightjar at the ringing hut

Close to the Sussex coast the reserve is the perfect habitat for migratory bird who seek out its low lying reedbeds and marshy peat bog.

Volunteers use long mist nets which are erected on rods to capture the birds in the reedbeds before they come in to roost every evening.

Nestled in the heart of the East Sussex countryside the reserve in Rye is one of the best places to spot migratory birds

Resting space: Once the birds have been weight they are placed in 'sleeping bags' for the night, these bags contain Sand Martins

After a night in the resting bags the Sand Martins are released to continue with their migration to Africa

Resting: With as many as a 1000 birds being caught a night every last bit of space is used to house them including in this case a washing line

The site is one of the worlds largest ringing stations, and with the help of BTO staff, trained ringers and volunteers as many as 1000 hirundines can be measured in one evening at this time of year.

The birds details are then recorded before it is then released the following morning to contiinue its journey.

The Information gathered including age, weight and sex allows the BTO to monitor long-term population and global migration patterns which is important for conservation. 

Other species are captured as part of the study are Nightjar, Grasshopper Warbler and Sparrowhawk. 

Sand Martins, House Martins and Swallows are all part of the Hirundine family which are of particular interest as they pass through southern England on their way to Africa
