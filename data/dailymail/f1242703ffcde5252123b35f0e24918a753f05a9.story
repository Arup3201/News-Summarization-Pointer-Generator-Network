The island thought to have inspired The Wicker Man goes on sale for £2.6million after the locals say they cannot repopulate it.

The current two owners of Tanera Mor, the largest of the Summer Isles in Scotland, have had no luck arranging a community buy out that could have seen people move on to the 800-acre isle.

The local community on the nearby mainland at Achiltibuie in Wester Ross have decided that re-populating the island is too much to take on.

Island home: The two owners of Summer Isle Tanera Mor have had no luck arranging a community buyout that could have seen people living on the 800-acre island

The island, which in 1881 had no fewer than 118 residents, is thought to be the set inspiration featured in pagan cult film The Wicker Man which was set on an isolated island, although the 1973 movie was filmed in Galloway and Plockton.

Mr Iain Muir, chairman of the Coigach Community Development Company who was given the first opportunity to buy the island on behalf of residents, said the community already had two renewable energy schemes and a possible buyout of a former smokehouse already on its plate.

Mr Muir, whose grandmother used to teach on the island, said: ‘People realised it was a good opportunity but the community is spread to thinly in its resources to take it on.

‘The decision was taken with a heavy heart not to pursue the very generous offer. Tanera is so important to the community - economically, socially and environmentally.

‘It is very much part of the community. Its future is in everybody’s interests. We are hoping the island will now go to a buyer who realises they are part of a vibrant community.

Consultant, Munro Gauld, carried out a ‘quick options appraisal’ on Tanera Mor to help the community make an informed decision.

Mr Gauld said: ‘Nobody wants to live on an island on their own - unless they are Robinson Crusoe and even he needed Man Friday.

‘And the Scottish Government would not fund a holiday home island full of holiday lets. Where is the public benefit in that?

‘So the island needs people to live there. There has been some positive ideas, tinged with realism, including its management. The world’s changed since the island was evacuated in the 1930s - around the same time as St Kilda but with broadband you can work anywhere.

‘The valuation is a big stumbling block. It would swallow up this year’s land fund in one go.’

With residents to move ‘offshore,’ it was one of the most unusual community buyouts ever proposed. It would have been taxpayer-funded under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003.

A £6m land fund which will help more rural communities buy their land was launched last year by the Scottish Government.

Mr Gauld also carried out the feasibility study for the proposed community buyout of Scalpay in the Western Isles where English businessman Fred Taylor had offered inhabitants the island for free.

All residents left in 1931 and permanent habitation has been intermittent since then. Many of the old cottages have been renovated and are now used as holiday accommodation.

Tanera Mor is also home to a salmon fish farm, a small sailing school, a cafe and a post office, which has operated its own local post and printed its own stamps since 1970. The island has no roads.Ironically the area around Achiltibuie, home to about 260 people, is not community-owned and is spread out mainly on two private estates.

Lizzie and Richard Williams, Tanera Mor’s two residents, took over running the island from Lizzie’s family, the Wilders who bought the island in 1996 after selling their dairy farm in Wiltshire.

Bill and Jean Wilder passed the title of Tanera Mor on to their three offspring - Jack, Harry and Lizzie - in 2010.

Now that all three siblings have their own young families, they took the decision to approach the community to discuss the possibility of a community buyout.

Tanera Mor is also notable as the location for Frank Fraser Darling’s book Island Years.
