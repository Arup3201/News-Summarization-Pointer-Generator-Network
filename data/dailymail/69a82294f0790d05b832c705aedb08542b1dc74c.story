If Scotland's match with  Germany wasn't entertaining enough, it seems another encounter on the pitch had everybody gripped on Sunday night.

During the Scots' Euro 2016 qualifier against the world champions Scotland's James Morrison and Germany's Christoph Kramer went head-to-head in a battle of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' while Marco Reus received treatment.

An aerial shot showed West Brom midfielder Morrison gesturing to his midfield rival whether or not he knew the game.

Rock, paper, scissors? An aerial view appeared to show Morrison asking Kramer whether he knew the game

Kramer, who plays his club football with Borussia Monchengladbach, on loan from Bayer Leverkusen, then proceeded to draw his hand to do battle.

However, while Gordon Strachan's side lost 2-1 - despite Ikechi Anya's impressive 66th minute equaliser - it's unknown who came out on top as Morrison's hand was blocked from view right at the decisive moment by one of the German physios!

Many on social media believe the pair resorted to the hand game in order to decide who should later regain possession but whatever the reason, Kramer was clearly amused by Morrison's challenge of a duel.
