A newlywed has died after he collapsed while playing in a Sunday league football match.

'Sports mad' Stephen Connor, 30, complained of feeling dizzy on the pitch before he was taken ill with a suspected heart attack.

Two players from the opposing team who are both first aid trained tried to revive Mr Connor using a defribrillator but he died later in hospital.

Tragedy: Stephen Connor died aged just weeks after marrying long-term girlfriend Nicola. The 30-year-old collapsed while playing in a Sunday league football match

The tragedy occurred just ten weeks after Mr Connor, an NVQ assessor, married his long-term girlfriend Nicola Blaxall, 26, near their home in Chorley, Lancashire.

The couple, who met seven years ago at Bangor University, had also just recently returned from a dream honeymoon in Las Vegas, San Francisco and Los Angeles and were planning to start a family.

Mrs Connor said: 'We still don’t know what happened. Stephen was fit and healthy and played football regularly. There was nothing to indicate that something like this could happen.

'On the Sunday he left for the football and just said "see you later". That was the last thing he said to me. I was just going out shopping.

'It is such a shock and, to be honest, his death hasn’t sunk in yet. We were only getting married 10 weeks ago and it was the happiest day of our lives. The we had a lovely honeymoon and now this has happened.

'All I can say is that I am thankful for seven and a half wonderful years with Stephen.

'He was such a wonderful easy going person and he would do anything for anyone. He was one of the loveliest people you could ever hope to meet.

She added: 'Everyone knew him through 
his love of football. He was a mad Burnley FC fan and was so happy to 
see them top of the Championship. We’re going to have a Claret and Blue 
funeral, in honour of the Burnley colours.'

The tragedy ocurred on Sunday while Mr Connor, 30, nicknamed 'Dingle' was playing in midfield for Plough FC in the Chorley Nissan Sunday League.

Thirty minutes into the game, he complained of feeling unwell then collapsed on the pitch.

The North West air ambulance arrived at the scene at 11.05am while two members of the opposition team carried out first aid.

The helicopter landed on the pitch at around 11.20am, airlifting Mr Connor to Royal Preston Hospital. However, efforts to revive him were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead.

Sam Bolton, one of the Halfway House FC players who tried to revive Mr Connor said: 'He collapsed on the pitch and we rushed to him and provided CPR. It was a mammoth effort from everybody.

I’ve known Stephen for a long time. It’s a terrible situation and I’m feeling it badly.'

Derek Heighway, league secretary, said: 'Everyone is in shock. He’d played Sunday League for a long time and was well known. He was a lovely lad.”

Mr Connor joined the club as a junior and later helping to coach the youth teams. He had played eight times this season for Plough FC, scoring two goals and being awarded Man of the Match for the game against Springfield FC on October 20.

John Cowley, club chairman, said: 'I can say, with absolute honesty, that he was probably the nicest lad I have ever been privileged to coach and work with. His personality was one of a very warm, open, sincere lad.'

Mr Connor's brother Andrew said: 'There
 is a massive, gaping hole left by his absence. He has played thousands 
and thousands of hours on the pitch of different sports and nothing has 
happened before.”

Sister Tricia said: 'He was kind-hearted and was always there when we needed him.'

He also leaves his parents, Tricia and Jim Connor, brother Andrew, seven nieces and nephews, and eight godchildren.

A postmortem examination will be held this week.
