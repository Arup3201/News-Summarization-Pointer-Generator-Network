At first look it may seem like a tropical bird escaped from an exotic pet store is roosting on a Darlington chimney but look again because this is a common pigeon that has been painted pink.

The shocking pink flier was spotted by a dog walker in the town who thought they were hallucinating until they realised the bird had undergone a dramatic colour change.

And although the fancy new colouring may be considered an improvement on the original by some wildlife experts have warned it could lead to attacks from other birds.

The bird looked a breed apart from its feathered friends but seemed more than happy to mingle with them among the beams

The shocking pink coloured pigeon was spotted nesting under a railway bridge in Darlington

Nik Shelton of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds(RSPB), said: 'The bird has clearly been dyed'

Dyeing pigeons has been condemned by a local animal sanctuary which warned changing a bird's natural colouring would make it far more vulnerable in the wild

The dog-walker, who caught sight of the bird in Darlington, said: 'I just couldn't believe my eyes.

'For a moment I had to look again, and again, just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating.

'The pigeon looked like something from Madagascar, and definitely not from Darlington.'

After examining the pictures Nik Shelton of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), said:

'The bird has clearly been dyed.Â 

The bird looked a breed apart from its feathered friends

A dog-walker first spotted the pink pigeon under this railway bridge in Darlington

An RSPB official confirmed they had recieved reports of pigeons and doves being died different colours for special events

Even from a distance the pink pigeon can clearly be seen

'It is likely to be a captive dove and we have had reports of these being dyed strange colours and released at special events.

'This one has clearly not returned to its owner afterwards.'

But the dyeing pigeons has been condemned by a local animal sanctuary which warned changing a bird's natural colouring would make it far more vulnerable in the wild.

Pat Kingsnorth, owner of Arc on the Edge wildlife sanctuary in County Durham, said: 'It may seem like somebody is just being stupid.

'But if it was that colour and it was outside it is going to be attacked by other birds.

'It is the color it is for a reason, to help it blend in.

'It is pretty common even for budgies kept as pets to be attacked when they are let out to fly.

'God forbid it it goes across a farmer's field because it could well be shot at. Being bright pink would certainly make it an easy target.'

Gerty, a 16 inch-long, 9lb fish, was put on a diet of prawn cocktail flavour Skips by a previous owner

Fish owners are being warned not to feed crisps to their pets after an aquarium had to wean a giant gourami off a diet of prawn cocktail Skips.

Gerty, a 16 inch-long, 9lb fish, lost her natural grey colour and turned to an unusual shade of pink when a previous owner fed her an unhealthy diet.

Staff at the Sea Life London Aquarium are now feeding her a healthier menu of grapes and bananas.

Curator Jamie Oliver said: 'I have never heard of a fish being fed crisps.

'Gouramis usually eat a diet of fruit and vegetation but fortunately Gerty doesn't appear to have suffered any ill effects from her unhealthy addiction.

'However, we would not recommend feeding fish crisps of any kind.'

Gerty is not the only unusual creature to come to the visitor attraction from private owners, and aquarium staff have nicknamed one display the tank-busters because it houses a number of large fish that grew too big for their previous homes.

Mr Oliver added: 'Many people don't do the right research when they buy fish and end up unable to care for them.

'Catfish are a good example and we have a number here that outgrew their homes.

'Terrapins are another - they can live for 40 years and are actually quite costly to care for.'
