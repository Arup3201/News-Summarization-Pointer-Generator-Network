AC Milan's impressive 4-2 win against Real Madrid on Tuesday night unsurprisingly made front page news in the Italian media on Wednesday.

In Corriere dello Sport, Rossoneri captain Riccardo Montolivo is pictured lifting the Dubai Football Challenge Trophy following Milan's win against the Spanish giants.

Stephan El Shaarawy scored twice, with Jeremy Menez and Giampaolo Pazzini also on target as Filippo Inzaghi's side ended the year on a high, while Real - managed by former Milan boss Carlo Ancelotti - suffered defeat for the first time since September.

Elsewhere in TuttoSport, Carlos Tevez is all smiles as he receives the Oscar del Calcio accolade after being named the best striker of the year in Serie A.

The 30-year-old has hit 24 goals in all competitions for the Turin giants this calendar year, playing a prominent role as Juve secured their third successive league title last season.

Roma legend Damiano Tommasi was on hand to present the award to Tevez.

Sport's front page focus on the decision of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to upheld FIFA's decision to punish Catalan giants Barcelona with a ban for two consecutive transfer windows.

Barca were issued with the ban by the world's governing body in April for repeatedly breaching transfer regulations, and had an appeal rejected in August by FIFA. 

Barca then took their appeal to CAS, but that has also been rejected, which means they will be unable to sign any players for the entirety of 2015.

 Marca hail Real Madrid striker Ronaldo as the 'man of the year' after 63 goals in all competitions

In Spanish newspaper Marca Cristiano Ronaldo is the headline act on the last day of the year, as the 29-year-old ended 2014 with a remarkable 63 goals - netting a consolation in Real's 4-2 defeat to Milan.

The Portugal forward has played a huge part in Real's continued success on the European stage, as they won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup and Copa del Rey this year.

Despite losing to Milan in the mid-season friendly, Real boss Ancelotti was unconcerned insisting: 'This defeat doesn’t hurt, it’s been a happy year.'
