A student has created a tiny working camera out of a Lego brick.

Graphic design student Ryan Howerter, 21, made a fully functional pinhole camera, which creates tiny photographic prints, housed in the space of the small toy block.

The Lego fan's tiny camera takes minuscule black and white photographs measuring 0.16 square inches (one square centimetre square).

The camera is seen here in Ryan Howerter's hand. The graphic design student created the working pinhole camera out of a single Lego brick

Mr Howerter, a student at Colorado State University, said: 'You can make a pinhole camera out of nearly anything.

'I love Lego - you can do so much with it.' 

A pinhole camera is a camera without a lens.

It has a small hole in one side that acts as an aperture to let in light.

When
 you point the camera at an object, light from the object travels through the hole and projects an inverted 
image on the film along the opposite side of the box.

This technique is similar to how eyes see and process images.

The smaller the hole, the sharper the image, yet the dimmer it will appear.

A pinhole camera's shutter is manually operated by a flap of card, for example.

The Lego camera works by exposing a sheet of photographic paper to light from a tiny pinprick.

Light comes in the side and strikes the photographic film, creating an image. 

The paper can then be developed in exactly the same way as a full-size photograph.

The camera, which can be held by a Lego figure, is made of a black two-by-two lego brick, a sheet of brass with a hole in the middle, and is sealed using black tape.

Mr Howerter said: 'The pictures are a little bit fuzzy but people are impressed by it.'

'The hardest part about building it is removing the central supporting column inside the brick - you have to use a dremel [tool] to get it out.

'I usually expose the pinhole for around ten seconds to get the images.'

Mr Howerter was inspired by a working pinhole camera made from a pine nut.

His Lego creation only took 20 minutes to build.
