The 1960s was a heady time of sexual revolution and social change where a woman's role and aspirations grew more than ever, and the adapting life and style of the 1960s was reflected in the magazine content of the time.

For the first time, a huge collection of illustrations has been compiled for a stunning picture book charting the decade's evolution from the homemaking ethos of romantic coupledom to the stylish liberation of mini-skirted Chelsea girls.

The book, Lifestyle Illustration of the 60s, gives a nostalgic glimpse into a world of retro sophisticated living where, according to the book's editor Rian Hughes, 'the men are urbane, the women kittenish and sultry'.

Lifestyle Illustrations of the 1960s traces the decade's evolution from the homemaking ethos of romantic coupledom

The book includes more than 1,300 beautiful 
and stylistically diverse artworks from magazines of the 60s, a 
time where most story illustrations were still produced by hand, by 
artists. 

Many
 illustrations were created by the very best British and American artists of the day; 
others by other talented individuals whose names have been lost in the 
mists of time.

The images provide an insight into the changing 
roles of men and women in society, the shifting concept of romance and 
the dawning of sexual freedom.  

It
 also provides a fascinating insight into the extraordinary artistic
 talents of the illustrators featured, as well as a glimpse into a new post-war generation's changing and growing social 
aspirations in an unprecedented era of political optimism for the future.

An enthralling overview of the time's leading lifestyle illustrators, it features page after page of stunning rediscovered artwork and provides a wonderful,
 nostalgic escape into a world of retro sophisticated living.
