A man has been arrested for the second time in three months for having sex with a horse called Nadia he is believed to be obsessed with.

Cirilo Castillo, 43, from Texas, was arrested again this week after the owners of the horse set up surveillance video in her corral after they found a 'mysterious bucket'.

They believed it was Castillo because he had repeatedly went after the mare in the past.

Once they saw him on the surveillance tape, they called Hidalgo County sheriff's department.

Unhealthy obsession: Cirilo Castillo was just released from prison in April for having sex with the same horse and was rearrested this week

Sheriff Lupe Trevino told the Houston Chronicle: 'We have a hell of a surveillance tape. It is not going to go to America’s Funniest Videos
 that is for sure.'

Castillo is a laborer and has prior arrests for theft and marijuana possession. He was released from jail in April for charges relating to the last time he had sex with Nadia.

But he was also arrested in January 2012 for having sex with two different horses on two different ranches. It is not known if one of the mares was Nadia.

There is no law against bestiality in Texas, so Castillo can only be charged with trespassing and possibly cruelty to animals - if they can prove Nadia was hurt during the sexual encounter.

Sheriff Trevino wants to help Castillo because he thinks he is a good guy with a problem.

'The guy is practically harmless, except for the horse,' he said.

'I can’t just ignore this and allow it 
to keep happening. Maybe we can get him some help, whatever 
we can do, we are going to try and do.'

He said Nadia’s owner first realized Castillo was back prowling in the night after she found a 'mysterious bucket' in Nadia’s corral on a recent morning.
