An plasterer murdered his identical twin brother on New Year's Eve with a kitchen knife before going to a party, a court heard.

Robert Cerqua's brother Christopher, a carpenter, was left with a seven-inch stomach wound after the 31-year-olds began arguing about 'the past' at their parents' house in Hythe, Hampshire.

Jurors in Robert's murder trial were played a chilling 13-minute 999 call by the pair's  parents, who pleaded with police to break up the fight before their father cried out: 'He's stabbed him'.

The 'extremely drunk' brother then left without putting on his shoes, joined his girlfriend at a New Year's Eve party and turned off his phone so he was uncontactable, Winchester Crown Court heard.

Christopher's father tried to stem his bleeding with a tea towel as he lay on the kitchen floor, but he had a cardiac arrest less than an hour later and was declared dead in hospital.

Police found Robert at a party in nearby Totton at 2.20am and told him he was being arrested - to which he replied only: 'Murder?'

He then fell asleep in the back of a police car on the way to Southampton Central Police station, jurors heard. When he woke up, he said: 'Is he dead? You are lying, he cannot be'.

While being taken to his cell, he added: 'Was it me? Was it me? I cannot remember. Honestly, is my brother dead?'

And when he was told the charge against him the next day, he allegedly said: 'I killed my f****** brother. I don’t want to be here any more.

'Nine times out of ten it would be all right. [That’s] just my luck, he had to die on me.'

Cerqua, who denies murder and told police his brother had threatened him, listened in the dock as the case was opened against him yesterday.

Prosecutor Nicholas Haggan QC said the brothers had spent a 'happy and relaxed' evening drinking at their parents’ terraced house from 6pm on December 31 last year.

But things soured at about 8pm when they started talking about 'the past', Mr Haggan said - leading to the emotional 999 call at 9pm by their mother Denise and father Peter.  

Abandoned party food such as cheese, apple and crackers and cans of Stella Artois lay littered around the room where Christopher was stabbed.

The couple have watched previous hearings from the public gallery, but were absent yesterday as their remaining son went on trial.

Mr Haggan told the jury of nine men and three women: 'This is a tragic case. In a nutshell, it was New Year’s Eve last year and both brothers had been drinking.

'Shortly before 9pm an argument started between the two brothers and that argument appears to have turned into a tussle. Punches may have been exchanged.

'At some point, this defendant picked up a kitchen knife and he used it to stab his brother.    

'The defendant inflicted just one wound, but the tract of that wound was quite long, about 15 - 17 centimetres or approximately six or seven inches, and it punctured the aorta, the principle artery which runs down a person’s trunk.

'That injury caused major internal bleeding and Christopher’s subsequent collapse.'

A post mortem revealed a six to seven inch stab wound on Christopher’s abdomen which cut through his aorta.

Tests showed he had 230 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, around three times the drink drive limit. Traces of cannabis and antidepressants were also found.

His face was bruised from a punch and where he fell to the ground.

Robert told police he had drunk six cans of lager and two glasses of red wine before leaving the house.

In interviews, Robert Cerqua said his brother had been threatening him with the knife and he had either taken it, or picked up another, in a bid to defend himself.

The kitchen knife said to have been used - its handle broken and the blade bent - was discovered in the kitchen sink.

DNA found on the knife matched both the defendant and his brother because, as identical twins, they shared the same DNA profile.

In his first police interview on New Year's Day, Robert described his relationship with Christopher as 'fiery' and said drink could make him 'nasty' and 'short-tempered'.

He added: 'We started arguing, I do not know about what... All I can remember is he picked a knife up and walked towards me and I sort of panicked.

'I do not remember much. I punched him - I had a knife in my hand. He yelped and I ran out of the door.'

In a later interview he said he had not intended to kill his brother but had 'just reacted'. 

Jurors heard text messages between Robert Cerqua and his girlfriend, Joelle Mansfield, which showed how the mood deteriorated.

Defendant: Robert Cerqua denies murder at Winchester Crown Court, Hampshire, where the trial continues

An earlier message from Cerqua read: 'I cannot wait to marry you!!! xxx', followed at 6.30pm by: 'Yes sexy. Chris wishes happy ‘New Year! xxx'.  

But at 7pm he wrote: 'Me and Chris are going at it. Talking about past. We got things to sort out but all good. Enjoy your night my lovely, I love you'.

At 8:10pm he wrote: 'There might be a fight in a minute. This is my life!! Don’t want this but what can I do. Had enough. Sorry but this is what I have got to put up with and I hate it. This is my life. Sorry, but blokes. Want to f*** off anywhere but here'. 

Christopher Cerqua was described in tributes as 'thoughtful and caring', and had recently got back together with girlfriend Lisa Harfield, 40, a receptionist.

The couple had previously dated for six years and her son and three daughters described him as a ‘father figure’.

Closing his opening statement, Mr Haggan said: 'This was a tragedy for Christopher, for his parents and for his family.

'No doubt the defendant bitterly regrets that moment of stupidity when he picked up that knife and chose to use it as he did, but it was not, we say, an act of self defence.

'Sad though it may be, the prosecution say that the defendant almost certainly acted in a fit of temper.

'Perhaps he did not intend to kill his brother but we say he almost certainly intended to really serious injury.

'If a person uses a knife, intending to cause that person really serious injury and they then die, then that person is guilty of murder.'

Cerqua, from Hythe, Hants, denies murder. The trial continues.
