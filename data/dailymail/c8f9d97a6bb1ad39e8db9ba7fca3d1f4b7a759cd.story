The US teenager accused of killing two British tourists in 2011 told a friend how he gunned them down as they pleaded for their lives, his trial heard.

Shawn
 Tyson, 17, is accused of killing James Kouzaris and James Cooper in 
April of 2011. He is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and 
could face life in prison if convicted.

Yesterday, 18-year-old Latrece Washington testified that Tyson told her he
 saw the two tourists walking through a housing project in Sarasota, 
drunk.

James Kouzaris and James Cooper were found
 shirtless and with their trousers down but with their 
wallets and a small amount of money

Washington testified that Tyson said he intended to rob the two 
men, but the men said they had no money.

‘He said “Well since you ain’t got no 
money I got something for your ass,”’ Washington recalled Tyson saying 
on the day after the killings.

Tyson told Washington that the men begged for their lives and one said, ‘please let me go home, I’m lost,’ she said.

Recounted
 Washington: ‘He shot one of them in the side and one of them fell 
instantly and the other one was crying for his life. He shot him.’

Judge Rick De Furia ruled that TV cameras should not broadcast Washington’s face because of fears for her safety.

As
 testimony continued Monday in the second week of the trial, a portrait 
of Tyson began to emerge. He was 16 at the time of the shooting, was 
behind in school and had the world ‘Savage’ tattooed on his chest.

Shawn Tyson enters the court room on the third day of his murder trial in Sarasota County Court in Florida. Tyson is accused of killing British tourists James Cooper and James Kouzaris in 2011

He and friends - many of whom had 
criminal histories - repeatedly watched Shottas, a 2002 movie about 
gangsters in Jamaica and Miami.

Kouzaris
 and Cooper were in Sarasota on a three-week holiday. On April 15, they 
went to dinner and then had drinks in downtown Sarasota.

Mr Kouzaris was from Northampton and Mr Cooper was from Hampton Lucy, Warwick.

The
 pair went to two bars and left on foot early in the morning of April 
16, and somehow strayed into a neighborhood known for its high crime 
rates.

Witnesses say they 
saw Cooper and Kouzaris walking shirtless and stumbling through the 
neighbourhood followed by two men, one with a red bandanna around part 
of his face.

Prosecutors 
are trying to link Tyson to the shootings by showing he had a friend 
bury .22-calibre bullets in a yard. That was the same calibre of 
ammunition used to kill Cooper, 25, and Kouzaris, 24.

Jermaine Bane testifies during the third day of Shawn Tyson's murder trial. He told the court Tyson phoned him on the night of the slayings

Defence
 lawyers contend there is no evidence linking Tyson to the bullets and 
that witnesses tying him to the scene are not credible.

Also
 on Monday, another witness, Jermaine Bane, said Tyson accidentally 
called him the night of the slayings, and Bane heard Tyson say to 
someone ‘Who are those crackers walking past the park?’ Shortly after 
that, Bane testified he heard gunshots. He described a cracker as a 
white person.

His friend Mr Bane today told the 
court he received several phone calls from Tyson both before and after 
he heard gunshots in the early hours of April 16.

He
 also told the court when police arrived to search Tyson's house later 
that day, he saw the teenager - then 16 - throw something into a 
friend's car.

Mr Bane said 
he had been friends with Tyson for about three years. They lived less 
than two minutes from each other and would often spend around 10 hours a
 day together.

Treshaun Simmons testifies at Shawn Tyson's Florida murder trial for the killing of British tourists James Cooper and James Kouzaris. Simmons said he had gone to Tyson's house to get some bullets

He said he often saw Tyson carrying a
 0.22 calibre revolver, usually in his pocket, and had seen him fire it 
into the air in the area, known by locals as 'the projects', about four 
or five times.

On the 
evening of April 15, 2011, Mr Bane, Tyson, and two friends spent the 
evening together 'smoking and chilling', and visited a Jamaican Club 
nearby.

The four split up 
just after midnight, with Mr Bane and one friend going to Mr Bane's 
house, while Tyson headed in a different direction, the court heard.

Mr
 Bane told the court he received a phone call from Tyson asking if he 
got home, but heard him carry on speaking, although he did not think 
Tyson was talking to him.

He said he heard Tyson say: 'Who are those crackers walking past the park?'

Mr Bane said: 'I kept saying 'hello', to see if he knew I was still on the phone.'

But Tyson did not answer and Bane hung up the phone.

Shortly afterwards, he heard gunshots.

James Kouzaris was shot and killed while on holidays with his friends in Florida

James Cooper enjoys his holiday in a bar. A few hours later he was gunned down alongside his university friend James Kouzaris in a rundown area of Sarasota

Mr
 Bane said after that his brother Jarius started 'beating down the 
door', adding: 'He was very loud like he was scared, like he was about 
to knock the door down.'

His brother was saying 'they're dead, they're dead', he told the court.

Mr Bane said Tyson then called him asking if he had heard gunshots and did he know what happened, and if 'anybody got hit'.

'I told him, 'I don't know 'cus I'm not out there',' he said.

'I wouldn't go out there because I didn't want to step into crossfire or anything.'

He said Tyson called him again, and asked him 'repeatedly' to go out and see if the people were dead, but he refused.

Later that day, when police arrived to search Tyson's house, Mr Bane said he saw Tyson throw something into a friend's car.

'He went over to the car. He opened the door and threw something in.

'He leaned towards under the seat, the driver's seat.'

Judge Rick De Furia oversees Shawn Tyson's murder trial in Sarasota County Court. Tyson is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and could face life in prison if convicted

Mr
 Bane originally told police he did not know anything about what had 
happened because he did not want 'the image of being a snitch', he said.

The
 court heard he was arrested in May and charged with carrying a 
concealed weapon, but the charge was reduced in seriousness in exchange 
for giving evidence in the Tyson trial.

Last
 week the court heard that phone records showed a series of calls were 
made to and from mobile phones registered to Tyson and Mr Bane just 
before 3am - around the time of the killing.

The court also heard Mr Bane was heard to make a comment that it was the phone calls that had 'f****d him up'.

Today he said: 'If it wasn't for the phone calls I wouldn't have been getting questioned.

'I didn't want to be put in the situation where I had to snitch or anything like that.'

Jermaine Bane picks out the type of gun allegedly used by Shawn Tyson, who is accused of killing British tourists James Cooper and James Kouzaris

Bane
 and his brother, Joshua Bane, both testified that they saw Tyson with a
 .22 calibre revolver before the April 16 shootings. Jermaine Bane also 
said he was testifying in exchange for authorities reducing a felony 
weapon charge against him to a misdemeanor.

Another
 friend, Treshaun Simmons, said he had been with Tyson and Mr Bane that 
night, and when the group split up, he went to Mr Bane's house with him,
 and shortly after, they both heard gunshots.

Mr Simmons also told the court he had gone to Tyson's house on April 15 to get some bullets.

He said: 'I needed bullets for my gun. I walked into Shawn's room....I got a pack of bullets that weren't open.'

On Friday, Tyson’s sister was arrested
 and charged with retaliating against a witness in connection with 
comments she made on Facebook to a woman who testified earlier in the 
week.
