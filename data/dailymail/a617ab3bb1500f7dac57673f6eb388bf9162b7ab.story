Health experts have issued a warning to parents after a primary school started selling Subway six-inch rolls in its canteen.

Students at Golden Grove Lutheran Primary school in Adelaide can now buy the fast food subs twice a week, despite concerns over the amount of fat and sugar in its products.

The idea was the brainchild of a mother of two pupils at the school - who is also the owner of a nearby franchise - and comes after teachers failed to find volunteers to staff the canteen.Â 

Fast food chain, Subway, and Golden Grove Lutheran Primary School has joined together, serving their students Subway twice a week

However, the move has concerned Dieticians Association of Australia spokeswoman Lisa Renn, who fears children could get bad eating habits if they have access to Subway at school.

'It is important to not establish the habit in the first place because it is hard to break.' Ms Renn told the Daily Mail Australia.

Bad eating habits can lead to obesity in children

'Hopefully this doesn't open the gates for allowing all sorts of fast food.

'Under the dietary guidelines for Australian children it is recommended that children only consumer zero to two serves of extra food a day, if the child isn't doing physical activity that consumption is zero.

'A meatball sub option would come under an extra in the saturated fat category.

'What we would prefer to see is offering yoghurt or fruit which would tick the dairy and fruit requirements, not a cookie or juice.'

Ms Renn added having Subway is not always unhealthy, as long as serve sizes are strictly monitored.

Students at Golden Grove can order four or six-inch subs and can also buy a cookie or a juice, according The Advertiser.

In South Australia, the government-backed Right Bite scheme offers guidelines about what food schools in the state should serve.

The rules ban high fat, high sugar and heavily processed foods in canteens.

Pam Kent, president of SA Primary Principals Association, said it was quite clear what should and should not be sold to students.

She added more schools in South Australia are outsourcing canteens because volunteers are hard to find.

'There is a lack of volunteers... there is not a massive attraction of helping in canteens in a voluntary capacity. Some schools have had to close their canteens, while others have had to outsource,' she told The Advertiser.

'The healthy eating regulations have kicked in which is a good thing, but the capacity to have big turnover with healthy foods has diminished as a result.

Neighbouring school, Wynn Vale Primary, shares its canteen with Golden Grove but has not employed Subway.

'We follow the healthy eating policy from the government,' principle Graeme Fenton said.

'We haven't felt the need to go down that path, there would be a consulting process with the governing body of the school.'

Subway didn't returns calls from Daily Mail Australia.
