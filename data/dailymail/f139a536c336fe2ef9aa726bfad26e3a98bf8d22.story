A London man fighting for ISIS in Syria is being investigated over the chilling footage of a Jordanian pilot burned alive in a cage.

Nero Saraiva, 28, is thought to have risen in the ranks to become one of ISIS's most senior fighters, working side-by-side with the British man seen beheading hostages in a number of videos, known as Jihadi John.

There is a possible link between the Jihadi John videos and the footage showing the barbaric murder of pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh on February 3, suggesting Saraiva could have been involved.

Saraiva is one of five young men from London who all moved from their native Portugal to London, where they converted to Islam before adopting extremist views and travelling to Syria to join the terrorist network's ranks.

A source at Portugal's Polícia Judiciária told the Evening Standard the country's National Unit of Counter-Terrorism was investigating Saraiva in connection with the videos and other activities.

'There are a lot of suspects under surveillance, Nero Saraiva is among them,' they told the paper.

'The European authorities have asked Portugal for their collaboration on the investigation,  particularly with those suspects with links to the UK.'

The five men, including Saraiva, who lived in Leyton and Walthamstow, have long been on the radar of intelligence officials - who believe the group plays a vital role in the production and dissemination of the sick beheading videos featuring Jihadi John. 

Ringleader Saraiva, a father-of-four and former engineering student, was the first of the group to travel to Syria in the summer of 2012.

He has a five-year-old son in the UK, who he has never supported financially, and is thought to have lived in Britain the longest, having appeared on the electoral roll in 2003.

Last year his name was linked to an alleged terrorist plot in east Africa involving al-Qaeda affiliate group al-Shabaab.

He is a known supporter of hate-preaching cleric, Abu Hamza, recently jailed for life in America for terrorism offences.

In July 2014 - 39 days before James Foley became the first Western hostage to be murdered - he posted a message on Twitter indicating he had advance knowledge of the American journalist's grisly fate.

Saraiva, who lived in a one-bedroom council flat in Walthamstow for three years, tweeted: 'Message to America, the Islamic State is making a new movie. Thank u for the actors.'

Just over a month later James Foley was beheaded in a YouTube video entitled A Message To America.

The group Mu'assasat al-Furqan is responsible for both the James Foley and Muath al-Kasaesbeh murder videos, according to the Evening Standard.

European security officials believe Saraiva and his London cell are responsible for the filming and dissemination of the series of sickening beheading videos, including the execution of British hostages Alan Henning and David Haines.

All five of the football-playing jihadists showed a passion for football in their younger years, and after moving to the UK, would often meet in a Portuguese-run café in London to watch matches.

It is still unclear how they were radicalised in Britain but the borough of Waltham Forest where they lived is known to be home to a number of Islamic extremists. 

All five of the men had family roots in Portugal's former African colonies and some were brought up to be Christians.
