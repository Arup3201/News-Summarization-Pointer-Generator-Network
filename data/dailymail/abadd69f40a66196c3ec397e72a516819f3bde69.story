It was always a case of tough love when it came to Alan Pardew and Sammy Ameobi.

The former Newcastle manager would openly air his reluctance to sanction a new deal for the Geordie winger, preferring instead to keep him hungry with the threat of being released by his hometown club.

It was a bait Ameobi took, winning a regular starting place having been on the periphery for the best part of three seasons.

Pardew handed Ameobi his first-team debut at Newcastle but left St James Park for Crystal Palace this month

But with Pardew now gone, it’s more a case of tough luck for the 22-year-old, whose contract expires in the summer.

Ameobi's Newcastle deal runs out in the summer

‘When the next manager comes in, if there is one, I need to prove myself all over again,’ Ameobi told Sportsmail.

‘I’m obviously playing for my career, essentially, but it is something I’m looking forward to. I’m very confident in my own ability. I have every opportunity to start for Newcastle every week. Hopefully I can do that, whoever comes in.’

Ameobi - who was loaned out to Middlesbrough in 2013 - believes he had won Pardew over with his performances this season. 

‘I think I did prove I was worth my place, yes,’ he added, ahead of his anticipated return from a knee injury against Southampton this evening.

‘That’s what I always wanted to do really. It’s my last season here so I need to prove myself if I want to stay and get a new contract.

‘That’s what I did but there is still a long way to go. There is a lot of hard work ahead and I am just looking forward to each game and to try and prove myself to whoever comes in.

‘Of course, the ultimate aim is to get a new deal and stay here. I really want to stay. It’s my hometown, I’m happy and I love it here.

‘It is just a privilege to play for Newcastle United. It is my dream club. I have supported them since I was a kid. Every week, I don’t take anything for granted and it’s a real blessing to be playing here.’

John Carver remains in caretaker charge of the Magpies. He brought Ameobi’s older brother, Shola, through the academy at the club and knows the family well.

And Ameobi Jnr added: ‘Obviously he has been here a long time and I know him well. He’s always looked after me, so hopefully he can get me a new contract!’ 

Sammy's brother Shola, pictured celebrating against Sunderland in 2012, also came through the  academy

Ameobi, meanwhile, was part of the Newcastle squad humiliated during the 4-0 defeat at Southampton in September, a result which left them bottom of the Premier League.

‘We want to put that right,’ he said. ‘We can’t let them walk all over us like they did at their place.

‘The defeat there was one of those days. It happens to every team. Everyone has had it at some point in their career. Everything went against us, they played really good football and they took us to the cleaners really.

‘We’ve got to make up for that now.’
