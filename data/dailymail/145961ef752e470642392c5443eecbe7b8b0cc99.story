In Afghanistan, they faced the horrors of war together - a courageous young soldier and his loyal canine companion.

But Lance Corporal Kenneth Rowe, 24, and Sasha a four-year-old yellow Labrador, also died together. Killed in a Taliban ambush while on patrol.

Yesterday their memory was honoured when the Army sniffer dog who lost her life alongside her handler was awarded the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross.

She received the PDSA Dickin Medal posthumously for uncovering 15 bombs and hoards of weapons - thought to be more than any other British dog in the 13-year conflict.

Her citation read: ‘Sasha’s actions were conducted in perilous conditions over a sustained period.

Without doubt she saved many soldiers and civilians from death or injury.’ Her calm presence and wagging tail also comforted and reassured soldiers risking their lives on the frontline.

At a special ceremony, Sasha’s posthumous medal was accepted by her previous handler Sergeant Major Andy Dodds and ex-sniffer dog Fire, a five-year-old black Labrador who was seriously injured in a bomb blast in Afghanistan two years ago.

L/Cpl Rowe’s proud family - father Ken, 63, mother Lyn, 55, and sisters Jenni, 32, and Steph, 27 - and former Army comrades were at the touching event in Kensington, west London.

Mrs Rowe, a legal practice manager from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: ‘Kenneth would be over the moon. If he is looking down he would be proud as punch that his dog had received an award for her hard work, devotion and life-saving.

‘It is no compensation for our loss but we feel proud and elated that recognition has gone to two who deserve it.’

L/Cpl Rowe, served with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps’s 104 Military Working Dog Squadron, attached to the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, in Helmand Province.

He had asked to work with Sasha when his previous dog, Diesel, another golden Labrador, was injured in an IED attack on a vehicle they were travelling in.

Sasha’s key role in the warzone was to sniff out hidden arms caches, improvised explosive devices and bomb-making equipment so soldiers could patrol safely.

On one occasion she was searching a mud-walled building when she detected two mortars and a large quantity of weapons, including explosives and mines.

During their time together, L/Cpl Rowe and Sasha ‘forged a unique bond’, said commanders. The pair were considered the best handler and dog team in the region.

But the pair were killed in a rocket-propelled grenade attack while taking part in a mission in Sangin, a Taliban stronghold, in July 2008.

L/Cpl Rowe had been due to leave the frontline the day before he died but he had volunteered to stay on because he was worried about his base not having enough search cover for comrades.

PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin said: ‘This is about recognising the immeasurable contribution to military operations made by Sasha.

‘Whilst it is a sad day for L/Cpl Rowe’s family and the Army, they should be extremely proud that their exceptional devotion to duty in Afghanistan saved many lives, both soldiers and civilians.

‘The award is even more poignant as we approach the centenary of World War One and are reminded of the huge debt we owe the animals who serve in times of conflict.’

Colonel Neil Smith, director of Army Veterinary and Remount Services, said the unit was ‘delighted’ that Sasha had been honoured.

He said: ‘Our soldiers and their dogs do a tremendous job, a job that saves countless lives. It is an honour to share this important day with L/Cpl Rowe’s family to recognise the work that he and Sasha undertook before being tragically killed.’

The Dickin Medal is the highest accolade that an animal can receive for saving human life while serving in a warzone.

Sasha’s posthumous presentation brings the total number of Dickin Medals awarded to animals in war to 65.

Since it was introduced by PDSA founder Maria Dickin in 1943 it has been awarded to 29 dogs, 32 Second World War messenger pigeons, three horses and one cat.
