Heirloom: John Holmes, from Dukes auctioneers, cleans the totem pole, which was being used as a coat stand but could fetch more than £100,000

A Native American totem pole that has been used as a coat stand in a backroom in Britain for the past 30 years could be worth more than £100,000.

The 6ft 7ins sculpture was bought by wealthy entrepreneur, John Allen Hughes, nearly a century ago from an indigenous tribe in the United States.

The item was passed down through the family to his granddaughter, who was unaware of its value until an auctioneer stumbled across it, strewn with scarves and coats, in a backroom of her house.

The auctioneer had been at the home in Dorset for a routine valuation of other household items when the sculpture caught their eye.

The family heirloom was later identified as a rare Native American totem pole from the early 20th Century.

Although it is estimated 
to sell for up to £10,000, another model from the Haida natives fetched 
more than £100,000 at an auction in New York in 2008.

This particular artefact will be sold at Dukes auctions in Dorchester, Dorset, on Thursday next week.

Mr Hughes is thought to have bought the pole from the Haida people as a memento of his trip to the U.S. and Canada in the 1920s, when he visited a number of tribes.

The carved cedar trunk, which Mr Hughes had shipped back to Britain, features images of a whale, a bear and a beaver underneath an eagle, which is what tribesmen believe they are descended from.

Native Americans engraved totem poles
to depict a series of events or to portray lineage through family, 
which is what experts believe these particular animals represent.

John Holmes, manager at Dukes, said: 
'John Allen Hughes was a very wealthy man and in the 1920s he did a tour
around North America.

'It seems like he bought the totem pole and shipped it back to the UK as a memento of the trip.

'The photograph pictures him with one of the tribes on his trip and would have been taken in central Northern America.

'The totem pole would have come from an area like the Pacific North West, Washington, and British Columbia.

'They have been thought to have a 
religious context but they are actually more of a representation of the 
status of the tribe, used to show lineage, or to tell a story.

'This totem pole is most likely to represent family lineage and features a whale, bear, and beaver below the eagle.

'The Haida spiritually believed that they were descendents of the eagle which is why it is at the top.

'Smaller totem poles were also 
sometimes used as a support for buildings and would create a small 
doorway, which forced people to bow as they entered the room.

'It was passed down to his granddaughter who had kept it in a back room of her farm house and used it to put her coat on.

'It's a rare item to come up at 
auction because there aren't many in private ownership and we are far 
away from the native area.'
