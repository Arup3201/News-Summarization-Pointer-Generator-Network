Championship high-fliers Middlesbrough have surprisingly parted company with assistant manager and former favourite Craig Hignett.

The Scouser - who played for the Teessiders between 1992 and 1998 - was a popular figure at the Riverside and had been credited in helping the team mount the promotion push which currently sees them just two points off top.

But the club announced the shock news on Tuesday morning that Hignett had left his position as Aitor Karanka’s No 2 with immediate effect.

A statement read: ‘Following discussions between Craig, head coach Aitor Karanka, and the club, all parties have agreed for Craig to leave his position with immediate effect.

‘The club would like to place on record its thanks for Craig’s efforts since joining us from Hartlepool last season and wish him all the best for the future.’

Hignett had previously worked at Boro’s academy before moving to Hartlepool as assistant to Colin Cooper.

Hignett made over 150 appearances for Middlesbrough between 1992 and 1998

When he left Victoria Park last season, Pools’ subsequent slump was attributed to his absence.

It is thought that Hignett’s methods may have been in contrast with those preferred by Karanka and his Spanish-speaking backroom team.
