The Grand Canyon may be an awe inspiring sight for us here on Earth, but a new image of the Martian landscape puts it into perspective - with a canyon over 4000m long and 10km deep.

The astonishing new images, released today by the European Space Agency, show the Valles Marineris, believed to be the largest canyon in the Solar System.

Stretching over 4000 km long and 200 km wide, and with a dizzying depth of 10 km, it is some ten times longer and five times deeper than Earth’s Grand Canyon, a size that earns it the status of the largest canyon in the Solar System.

The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446 km) long, up to 18 miles (29 km) wide and attains a depth of over a mile (6,000 feet / 1,800 metres) at its deepest point.

Nearly two billion years of the Earth's geological history have been exposed by the Colorado River and its tributaries as they cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted, creating a vast area that has become hugely popular with tourists.

The bird’s-eye 
view of Valles Marineris was created from data captured during 20 
individual orbits of ESA’s Mars Express.

ESA says a wide variety of geological features can be seen, reflecting the complex geological history of the region.

'The canyon’s formation is likely intimately linked with the formation of
the neighbouring Tharsis bulge, which is out of shot and to the left of
this image and home to the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus
Mons,' it said.

'The volcanic activity is revealed by the nature of the rocks in the 
walls of the canyon and the surrounding plains, which were built by 
successive lava flows.

'As the Tharsis bulge swelled with magma during the planet’s first 
billion years, the surrounding crust was stretched, ripping apart and 
eventually collapsing into the gigantic troughs of Valles Marineris..

The images also show intricate fault patterns believed to have developed due to the imposing 
extensional forces; the most recent are particularly evident in the 
middle portion of the image and along the lower boundary of the frame.

Landslides have also played a role in shaping the scene, ESA officials said, especially in 
the northern-most troughs, where material has recently slumped down the 
steep walls.

Mass wasting has also created delicate erosion of the 
highest part of the walls.

Strong water flows may have reshaped Valles Marineris after it was 
formed, deepening the canyon.

Mineralogical information collected by 
orbiting spacecraft, including Mars Express, shows that the terrain here
was altered by water hundreds of millions of years ago.
