Fears are growing that Kell Brook's boxing career will have to be put on hold, at the very least, after being stabbed in the leg in Tenerife.

Brook is now 'stable and sitting up in bed', according to his promoter Eddie Hearn, who has flown to the hospital bedside of Britain's newest world champion as doctors begin assessing the full extent of the damage.

There is little or no chance of Brook making a first defence of his IBF welterweight title as scheduled in his home city of Sheffield on December 6.

Kell Brook's career-defining victory over Shawn Porter in Los Angeles last month finally proved what he'd always insisted, that he could mix it with the worlds best.

The Sheffield star had won 32 fights as a professional before earning his shot at the IBF welterweight title, a journey that had more than it's fair share of roadblocks.

Brook was the mandatory challenger to the great Manny Pacquiao as far back as 2010 but instead had to bide his time. A switch to promoter Eddie Hearn saw an upturn in his fortunes as he progressed from fighting in leisure centres to filling out arenas.

Victory over Hector Saldivia two years ago manoeuvred him into position to fight then champion Devon Alexander but injuries to both men saw the fight postponed three times and eventually cancelled.

Instead, he faced the undefeated Porter, outpointing the champion to become the sixth Brit to hold a world title in the division and the first since Ricky Hatton's brief stint in 2006.

That victory should catapult him into the realm of mega-fights with a domestic dust-up with bitter British rival Amir Khan on the cards for next year.

If, as suspected, there is muscle and trauma damage as well as the blood loss which required substantial transfusion, the worst case scenario is that he could miss out on a projected mega-money Wembley Stadium spectacular with Amir Khan next year.

Hearn told Sportsmail on Friday: 'I can confirm he has a leg injury but there is no injury to his arm. He is stable and sitting up in bed, with his family and myself at his bedside.

'I have not yet spoken to his doctors so I can't comment on the severity of the issues, but I will be making a statement later today.'

Hearn was unable to comment on a tweet purporting to be from the Brook family that claimed the boxerunderwent 'a major operation that saved his life'.

Brook is understood to have been on a night out in Golf De Sur with his heavily pregnant partner, Lindsey, who left early and was not present when the altercation occurred. He is said to have met up with friends after parting company with his girlfriend, before heading back to Las Adalfas in the early hours.

It is believed he may have spent time with his attacker on the night of the incident.

Onlookers at the scene, close to the Golf De Sur resort in southern Tenerife, have described a trail of blood from an apartment at the Las Adalfas complex, to a second apartment where Brook is understood to have attempted to gain entry by smashing a patio window.

Rising: Brook is unbeaten in 33 fights. He was scheduled to return to the ring in December, but that's in doubt

Plans for Brook to travel to Las Vegas next week to be at ringside for Floyd Mayweather's rematch with Marcos Maidaina have been scrapped already.

This is not the first time Brook has been stabbed as the result of a late night altercation.

Following the first incident, in Sheffield seven years ago, he was out of action for six months.

It will be deeply unfortunate for Brook if these latest wounds jeopardise his career, at 28, just as he is about to cash in on his unbeaten career.

His battling, against-the-odds victory over Shawn Porter in America a fortnight ago finally made him a world champion and extended his record to 33 straight wins.
