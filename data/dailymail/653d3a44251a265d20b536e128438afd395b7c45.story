A former high school teacher accused a sexually abusing a 17-year-old female student has resolved her case.

Gaile Kristine Supp, 25, entered an Alford plea last week on a count of third-degree sexual battery. The plea means that although the defendant asserts their innocence, he or she also admits that prosecuting evidence would likely to persuade a jury to a guilty verdict.

Supp, from Utah, once taught at Clearfield High School. She was accused of inviting the student to her West Haven home in January 2013 to help with her homework.

Ex-teacher Gaile Kristine Supp, 25, entered a plea on a count of third-degree sexual battery in Utah and will not face trial after allegedly trying to seduce a 17-year-old female high school student 

She then allegedly showed the girl a movie with a sex scene in it before forcing herself on the teen - who told her no. Supp then allegedly continued to abuse the student, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. 

Supp was originally charged with first-degree object rape and was held on $20,000 bond.

The teacher was placed on administrative leave on January 14, 2013 after the student reported the incident.

She was arrested in May 2013 after police searched her home.

Supp had only been hired to teach agricultural classes for one year and her contract was due to run out at the end of term.

A four-day trial had been set for Monday on the original rape charge. Supp will now be sentenced on October 29. Prosecutors have agreed to recommend probation over prison at sentencing. 

With a third-degree felony, she will not be required to register as a sex offender but as part of the plea had her teaching license revoked.
