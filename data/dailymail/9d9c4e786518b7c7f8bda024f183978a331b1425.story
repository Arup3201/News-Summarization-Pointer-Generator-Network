Rory McIlroy and Adam Scott walk the fairways together at the Memorial tournament in Ohio on Thursday at the start of what everyone, from the Northern Irishman downwards, hopes will be a summer-long rivalry.

In Houston last month, the 25-year-old, wearing his fan’s hat, said he thought the game was lacking something in the absence of a heavyweight contest.

‘I think it would be great if we got back to the sort of rivalry we’ve seen in the past,’ said McIlroy. ‘When you look at the Tiger and Phil effect, wouldn’t it be great if we got back to something like that?’

At the time, both Scott and McIlroy had just blown tournaments in Florida. ‘No disrespect to the players who won but Adam and myself, players who have won majors and dealt with pressure, should be closing those tournaments out,’ he said. ‘We should be stepping up to the plate.’

Last weekend, on the best Sunday of the golfing year, both did just that with McIlroy winning in sensational style at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth and newly crowned world No1 Scott equally impressive in outlasting USPGA champion Jason Dufner in a play-off in Texas.

Now the pair compete in their final event before next month’s US Open at Pinehurst. Organisers have seized the opportunity to pair them up.

‘They’re both so talented and in form so it should be fun to watch,’ said event host Jack Nicklaus.

As for the lingering fascination with his split from fiancee Caroline Wozniacki, McIlroy would not comment on reports he broke up from the Danish tennis star in a three-minute phone call. ‘I’m here to talk about my golf,’ he said.

Also competing in Ohio are Justin Rose, who puts his major title on the line in a fortnight, and Luke Donald, who became a father for the third time last week.
