It's not the most conventional entrance to a television interview but then Bear Grylls arguably doesn't live a conventional lifestyle either.

The survival expert smashed his way into the ITV studios ahead of his interview on the This Morning sofa with presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford yesterday. 

He made the dramatic appearance onto set to promote his new show, Bear Grylls: Mission Survive, which starts next week.

Bear Grylls smashed his way through the windows of ITV studios ahead of his interview on This Morning

The programme opened with the presenting couple running through the show's items before it cut to a scene with the adventurer steering a Zodiac Inflatable Raiding Craft up the River Thames.

He was escorted to the studio by the London branch of the Royal Marines Reserve, of which Bear is an honorary colonel.

Leaping from the boat he ran along the river bank towards the building, while cameras returned to the studio where Eamonn and Ruth returned to what was coming up on the show.

Meanwhile a rope is dropped outside the window behind them as Eamonn jokes it 'must be the window cleaner'.

The show opened with Bear Grylls riding up the River Thames in an inflatable craft with reservists from the Royal Marines

He then ran along the South Bank before climbing up a rope, which descended from the top of the building

Seconds later Bear crashes through the window pane, sending shards of glass all over the set, as he greets the 'shocked' presenters saying: 'I know a good glazer.'

Sitting on the sofa he says: 'My heart rate it still a little high after racing down the river, but I like the focus of one chance to do it.'

Surrounded by his family who were watching his arrival, Bear looked over to his sons and said 'guys, you are the best, thanks for coming'. 

He continued, 'I always say to my kids in the wild that you only get it wrong once, you've got to be smart.'

The inside shots show Grylls taking a swing and smash into the window pane, as glass shatters everywhere

The adventurer was promoting his new programme where he takes eight celebrities into the depths of a Central American rainforest, and they will be competing in an epic 12-day survival mission.

Bear said: 'There is no blueprint for a hero. I'm searching for the ultimate survivor - if my kids were stuck in the jungle with no one and I wasn't there, who would I want beside them. 

'And these guys, I took eight celebrities who had never done anything like this before, but I said it's not about where you start, it's about where you finish.' 

He added, 'Every couple of days I'm sending home the person that I believe would - if we weren't there - then they wouldn't make it out alive.

Bear was on the This Morning sofa to speak about his new programme where he will take the likes of Mike Tindall, Dame Kelly Holmes and Jamelia with him into a Central American rainforest in a bid to survive

'The jungle has every sort of terrain, rivers to the high cliffs, crocodiles, snakes, scorpions, they had to catch their own food, live off the land, and as the journey went on I started to restrict the amount of gear they had. 

'We start off with eight and by the end, only three of them are on the final bit of the journey… and ultimately I pick that person who I believe will be the guy or the girl that I'd want beside [me].'

Speaking about some of the celebrities he revealed Dame Kelly Holmes was 'super positive' and Mike Tindall is a 'humble, hard-working guy'.

Joining Bear are actors, and cousins, Emilia Fox and Laurence Fox, singer and actor Max George, TV presenter and singer Jamelia, comedy actor Tom Rosenthal, and presenter Vogue Williams.
