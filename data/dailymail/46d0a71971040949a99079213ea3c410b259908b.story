A Massachusetts boy is heartbroken after the gifts he received at his birthday party were seemingly accidentally loaded into a different vehicle and disappeared.

Presents in honor of Gage Desmond's fifth birthday have yet to show up, his mother Jessica Fratoni has said, despite her efforts to get them back.

The boy's presents were reportedly lost Sunday.

Birthday boy: Gage Desmond is heartbroken after his gifts were seemingly accidentally loaded into a different vehicle and disappeared

The Salem News reported that that after a bowling alley birthday party for the boy, a friend volunteered for the job of placing the items in Fratoni's car.

It seemed as though the presents were placed in another car, according to the newpspaper.

Fratoni told the Salem News 'This is the worst thing that could possibly happen to a 5-year-old boy.

'He cried yesterday because he was wondering where his gifts were.'

She also told the newspaper 'I told him honestly. Nana's friend put them into the wrong car.

'And we don't know where they went. But he's not quite grasping that.'

The Salem News reported that Fratoni reached out to the bowling alley, which in turn got in touch with different parties - and no one has come forward.

She also reached out to police and asked for help on Facebook, according to the newspaper.

Fratoni was quoted by Peabody Patch as saying on the social media website 'I’m trying to spread the word and pray someone is kind enough to return his stuff to either the Metro Bowl or the Peabody Police Department.'

'She said she used my key to unlock it,' Fratoni told the Salem News. 'I said, "That doesn't happen." You can't use the same key to unlock two cars. I'm guessing the car was already unlocked.'

Fratoni told the newspaper 'It's hard to believe, that if someone finds the gifts in their car they won’t say, "These had to be put there at the Metrobowl by mistake." And they'll bring them back.”

The boy's great-grandmother, Sandra Hopkins, also spoke to the news outlet, saying 'I'm waiting for the right time [to talk to the woman]. She wanted to be helpful.

'She saw a Honda Pilot and she thought that was it. ...She's an older woman.'
