Azelle Rodney, 24, died in 2005 after being shot. Ex-specialist firearms officer Anthony Long has today been named as the man charged with his murder

The police marksman charged with the murder of robbery suspect Azelle Rodney has been named for the first time today.

Anthony Long, who until now has been known only as E7, is an ex-specialist firearms officer with the Metropolitan Police CO19 section.

He is facing a murder charge in relation to the fatal shooting of Mr Rodney, 24, in Edgware, northwest London, on the night of 30 April 2005.

Long, whose address was given as the Police Federation Headquarters in Leatherhead, Surrey, can be named after reporting restrictions were lifted at the Old Bailey.

He is due to go on trial on June 8 next year, with the case expected to last around a month.

Long, who did not attend today’s hearing before Mr Justice Sweeney, is accused of killing Mr Rodney.

Mr Rodney died after officers stopped the car he was travelling in with two other men, fearing that they were armed and on their way to rob Colombian drug dealers.

He was hit six times, once each in the arm and back, and fatally four times in the head.

The Crown Prosecution Service announced it planned to charge the officer with murder in July, after reviewing new evidence following the outcome of a public inquiry into Mr Rodney’s death.

Sir Christopher Holland, who chaired an inquiry into Mr Rodney’s death last year, ruled that there was ‘no justification’ for the shooting by Long.

Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham - Mr Rodney’s fellow passengers in the VW Golf - were both handed custodial sentences for drugs and firearms offences in January 2006.

Lovell was also convicted of allowing drug production in his Hammersmith home. He was jailed for seven years, while Graham was handed a six year sentence.

Susan Alexander, Mr Rodney’s mother (pictured last year), has campaigned vigorously for an apology from the Met for the ‘execution’ of her son. In July, she said she was 'very pleased' the officer had been charged

The shooting took place outside The Railway Tavern on Hale Lane in Edgware, north London in April 2005

Mr Rodney, of west London, had two brothers and a girlfriend who gave birth to his daughter after he was fatally shot.

Susan Alexander, Mr Rodney’s mother, has campaigned vigorously for an apology from the Met for the ‘execution’ of her son.

After Long was charged in July, she said: ‘I am very pleased at the decision to prosecute the officer who killed my son. I have waited a long time to see this day and hope this prosecution will lead to justice for Azelle.’

Long has not yet entered a plea to the charge of murder.
