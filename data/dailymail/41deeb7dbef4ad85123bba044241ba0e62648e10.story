Prince George was today christened wearing a delicate lace gown that is an exact replica of one worn 172 years ago by Queen Victoria's first born.

When he was welcomed into the faith by the Arch Bishop of Canterbury today, George wore an ivory gown made of delicate Honiton lace and white satin, worn before him by every baby born to the British Royal family since 1841.

Royal
 babies were traditionally, until 2004, christened wearing the intricate
 lace and satin gown made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, 
Victoria, Princess Royal in 1841 and used for generation after 
generation of royal infants including the Queen’s father King George VI,
 the Queen, Charles, William, Prince Harry, with Lady Louise 
Mountbatten-Windsor the last royal baby to wear it in 2004.

Crafted from layers of delicate, hand-made Honiton lace and ivory satin, it was 
used for all royal christenings until 2004 when
Queen Elizabeth decided the gown was past its prime and ordered an exact replica to be crafted by her personal 
dressmaker.

An entire team of 
seamstresses set to work at Buckingham Palace to recreate the intricate bows 
and high collar of the original gown, and it was first used for the 
christening of James, Viscount Severn, son of Prince Edward and Sophie, Earl  and Countess of 
Wessex, in 2008.

A Royal christening is an important
 occasion - both socially and spiritually.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have given their approval to the first ever royal christening coins created in the UK.

The special coins, which have been produced by the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, South Wales, go on sale today to mark the christening of the couple's son, Prince George.

The design features the Lily Font from the Tower of London and two harp-playing cherubs.

At the foot of the coin is the royal motto "Dieu et mon droit" - God and my right.

The £5 coin is available in silver - because the crossing of a baby's palm with silver is said to confer good health and prosperity to newborns - and gold - to commemorate the royal celebration.

Not
 only does it reinforce the family's faith, but in the case of Prince 
George, who is in direct line to the throne, it has more significance.

As a future king, George will become 
Protector of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England and
 therefore must be a full, confirmed member of the religion.

Such was the significance of baby George’s christening that the duty fell to
 the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby - leader of the 77-million 
strong Anglican Communion - to carry out the ceremony.

The
 event is also a key gathering for those in the royal inner circle. 
Mostly held in private, away from the public and the media, royal 
christenings are usually attended only by family, godparents and close 
friends - the people who will directly influence the Prince as he grows 
up.

George is the first 
future monarch in modern times not to be baptised at Buckingham Palace, 
with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge choosing the intimate Chapel 
Royal at St James’s Palace instead.

William and the Prince of Wales were both christened in Buckingham Palace’s Music Room. The Queen, who was not expected to be queen when born, was christened in the Palace’s private chapel in 1926.

But Edward VIII, who later abdicated, was baptised at White Lodge in Richmond Park in 1894 and his brother George VI, who was not expected to be king, was christened at the Church of St Mary Magdalene close to the Sandringham estate in 1895.

George is three months old - older than his father, grandfather and great-grandmother were when they were christened. William was baptised on August 4 1982 at the age of six weeks, while the Prince of Wales was one month and one day old at his own christening. The Queen was just over five weeks old when she was christened.

Although there are usually official christening pictures released
 to the public - in this case, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have 
chosen renowned showbiz photographer Jason Bell to take the photos - the
 ceremony itself is a private affair.

A notable exception to the usual privacy surrounding royal christenings is that of Princess Eugenie in 1990.

Nine-month-old Eugenie was baptised during morning service at the church of St Mary Magdalene at Sandringham just before Christmas in 1990.

The christening was broadcast by loudspeaker across the royal estate at Sandringham, Norfolk.

Microphones relayed the service to  a crowd of 2,000 outside the church.

'It
 was a lovely family occasion, a truly happy day,' said the Bishop of 
Norwich, the Rev Peter Nott, who conducted the 50-minute service.

Queen
 Elizabeth, meanwhile, was baptised by the Anglican Archbishop of York, 
Cosmo Gordon Lang, in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace, on 29 May
 1926.

Prince
 William was christened in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace on 4 August 1982, while 
Prince Harry was christened in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in 1984.

Royal christenings have not always been plain sailing. At Queen Victoria’s in 1819, there was a dispute over what she should be called.

Her mother the Duchess of Kent had wanted to call her Georgiana Charlotte Augusta Alexandrina Victoria, but was overruled by a cantankerous Prince Regent, the future George IV, who dictated during the ceremony that she be called Alexandrina Victoria instead in tribute to the Russian Tsar Alexander I.

The Duchess was left distraught and broke down sobbing during the proceedings.
