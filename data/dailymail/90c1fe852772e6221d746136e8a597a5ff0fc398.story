This could be the world's oldest unopened Easter egg, still in mint condition 56 years later.

Judith Bowen, 73, was 17 years old when she bought the chocolate egg as a gift for her late mother Edith.

The egg, wrapped in gold paper with decorative flowers, took pride of place on the sideboard.

But Edith never got round to tucking in to the chocolate treat.

Mrs Bowen, from Wootton, Bedfordshire, found the handmade egg when clearing out her mother's bungalow after her death ten years ago, with its wrapper still intact.

The great-grandmother-of-two shelled out a few shillings on the gift, made by Gold Star Hand Made Sweets of Essex, for Edith in 1957.

The former sewing machinist said: 'I had just been paid and I saw it in the window of a shop. I just thought "my mum will really love that".

'She was so thrilled when I gave it to her that she put it on display on the sideboard.

'For a number of years she got it out every Easter and put it there. She was very careful and precious with special things.

'We were clearing out her house after she passed away and I saw this little box in the sideboard.

'I opened it up and it was as good as the day I gave it to her, all still wrapped up in gold paper.'

Mrs
Bowen and her husband Michael haven't been tempted to tuck into the 
egg, which may not taste so good after half a century, but plan to pass 
it down to their children.

At 56, the egg is a few years older than one still in its original cellophane showed off in 2010 by Hillian Fern, then 63, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

She had been given the egg when she was 13, but couldn't bear to eat it because it was far too pretty.

There is no official record for the oldest Easter eggs in the world - wrapped or unwrapped.

But the accolade could belong to Moir Taylor, from Featherstone, West Yorkshire, who found an unwrapped 1934 purchase in the home of her uncle's wife shortly after he death in 2008.
