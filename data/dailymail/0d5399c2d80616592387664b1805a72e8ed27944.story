After surviving nearly 150 years locked from public eye this astonishing collection of exceptionally preserved and rarely seen Civil War photographs, letters and all 56 signatures of the Declaration of Independence have been revealed at auction this week

Among 97 items slated to fetch tens of thousands before Thursday, original portraits of future U.S. presidents, soldiers and handwritten documents detailing imminent surrender highlight the gallery.

Topping bids as of Tuesday night, a handwritten letter from Gen. Robert E. Lee in 1865 documents his final attempt at securing Virginia from Lt Gen Ulysses S Grant.

Auction highlights: Among the runner ups in top bids are these pictures, from left, of James A. Garfield, future U.S. president, and Jefferson Davis, leader of the Confederacy

This rare photo of Lt Gen Ulysses S Grant, left, is currently fetching more than $1,300 in bids while right, a photo of Union General George B. McClellan is seen while currently selling for more than $1,100

Sending off his worried outlook to Gen J.E. Johnston in North Carolina he writes in one line: ‘We cannot fight Grant to advantage as long as he holds his entrenchments.’

Crisp and golden with age, the document has promised more than $10,000 from one of 25 eager bidders.

Banding
behind that letter are the portraits of dozens of civil war soldiers, 
including Lt Gen Ulysses S Grant prior to his presidency in 1869.

'Wartime portraits of Garfield in uniform are exceptionally scarce and highly desirable,' RR Auction writes with the item.

That portrait, as well as several others, has racked up more than $1,300 in bids.

Top bids: Left, this letter written and signed by Gen. Robert E Lee is looking to fetch more than $10,000 at auction this week while this letter right by Confederate Gen James Longstreet is currently selling for $477

Highlight: On Saturday this document showing the signature of Button Gwinnett will mutually be up for auction, as one of the rarest signatures of all 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence

Original photos: This vintage sepia 8 x 5 photo of Butterfield posing with General Joseph Hooker and several other officers at Lookout Valley, Tennessee in 1863 is looking to fetch $525 by Thursday

Union Generals: From left Union Generals Henry W. Halleck, currently selling for more than $500 along with Abner Doubleday, often credited for the invention of baseball, who's photo is currently fetching more than $900

Just ahead of Grant in highest bids are bust portraits of James A. Garfield, future 1881 U.S. president, and Jefferson Davis, leader of the Confederacy holding its presidency until its fall in 1865.

At a current bid of $2,244, Garfield's bust is the second highest priced item up for sale with Davis’ stamped at $1,531 in third.

‘Wartime portraits of Garfield in uniform are exceptionally scarce and highly desirable, and this is the only example of such a photograph that we have ever offered,’ they write with Garfield’s image.

Offering a second exquisite opportunity 
of owning a piece of time after the U.S. nearly broke into two, 
signatures of all 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence are 
also up for bidding come Saturday.

Appearing in the live auction in Nashua, New Hampshire, the assortment of signatures appear in various forms while most prominently said to be displayed in historically significant letters, detailing the words and thoughts of the nation's most important Founding Fathers.

Monumentally as the auction house notes, is the rarest autograph of all of them with only 51 other examples believed to exist.

That signature is of Button Gwinnett, captured in a historic 1773 document signed by the Georgia Signer.

'This is a rare opportunity to 
acquire a complete set of the Signers of the Declaration of 
Independence, one of only forty collections known to exist,' RR Auction 
writes with the event.

John Adams: This letter written and signed by John Adams would be included in Saturday's live auction

Benjamin Franklin's signature is beautifully printed in a letter addressed to a friend in 1783

Touted as the Proctor-Sang-Newell Collection, the signatures are from three privately owned collections, the first completed by Thomas R Proctor in 1905 before its gradual sale.

Purchased by Richard Newsell in 2002 in a private sale from Philip D. Sang before transitioning to auction this week, the auction house writes:

'It is believed that together with the additions made by Richard Newell, this will be the largest offering of individual Signers in the past fifty years.'
