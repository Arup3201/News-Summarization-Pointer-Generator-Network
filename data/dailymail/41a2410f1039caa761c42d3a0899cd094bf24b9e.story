Alan Pardew has challenged two of Newcastle’s forgotten men to help save his job.

The United boss admits to having had doubts about the future of Sammy Ameobi and Gabriel Obertan at the club.

Indeed, Ameobi made just 10 Premier League appearances before being sent on loan to Middlesbrough last season, while Obertan was spotted just three times.

But the pair laid on the goals for Papiss Cisse during last weekend’s 2-2 draw at Swansea, a result which has eased pressure on Pardew in the short term.

Obertan, 25, and Ameobi, 22, are now set to start against Leicester a week on Saturday as the Magpies go in search of their first league win at the eighth attempt.

Pardew, though, says the duo still have a lot to prove to both himself and supporters.

‘We’ve had to have the patience of a saint with Sammy and he’ll admit that,’ said Pardew, who warned the younger brother of former United striker Shola that his days at the club were numbered.

‘Now we need to see him deliver. The threat to him is still there – this is a big season for him.

‘He did particularly well when he came on at Swansea. He’s someone I’ve spoken about so many times over the past few seasons, talking about his potential.

‘He’s been a young player in the shadow of his brother for a long time. But this is a guy who is quick and has fantastic technical ability – he should be ripping this division up really, but he hasn’t been.

Newcastle fans have reacted angrily to their side's start to the campaign, calling for Pardew's head

‘I was in a lift with him and his head was hitting the ceiling – he’s six foot five as well. So he has looked a lot better this season but now he has to concentrate.’

Obertan, meanwhile, has at times been ridiculed by fans following his £3million move from Manchester United in 2011, a deal which was on Pardew’s recommendation.

That being the case, the manager has always hoped for more from the French winger.

‘Gabby had a great spell when he first arrived then lost his way a little bit,’ he said.

‘He’s had to earn the trust of our fans and our staff to get a chance.

‘But this season he looks really focussed. Remember, he’s only a young man and he could be a big player for us this year.

‘We were much more of a threat in the final third against Swansea (with Obertan starting) and I was pleased for him.’

It was Cisse who got on the end of crosses from Obertan and Ameobi at the Liberty Stadium and, like the providers, he has come in from the cold this season after struggling for form and fitness last time around.

But Pardew added: ‘The injury (a broken kneecap suffered in April) has probably done him a favour. It’s given him a good rest and he’s got his enthusiasm back to full tilt.

‘He’s made the difference for us and his commitment could not be faulted.’
