A Tory MP was under fire today after claiming Lib Dem Sarah Teather was a poor families minister because she did not ‘produce’ a child of her own.

In remarks which were angrily condemned by the Lib Dems, Tim Loughton said his former colleague had made the Department of Education a ‘family-free zone’.

Equalities minister Jo Swinson tore into Mr Loughton, branding him 'shameful, crass and frankly disgusting'.

Conservative Mr Loughton, who was fired along with Miss Teather in last year’s reshuffle, tried to shrug the comments off joking ‘what am I being panned for now?’

Condemned: Ex-Tory minister Tim Loughton, who was fired in last year's reshuffle, criticised former Lib Dem minister Sarah Teather for not having a family of her own

Mr Loughton claimed Miss Teather, who is childless, ‘doesn’t really believe in family’.

Speaking at a Tory event in Windsor, he said: ‘The person who was actually in charge of family policy amongst the ministerial team at the DfE was Sarah Teather. Which was a bit difficult because she doesn't really believe in family.

‘She certainly didn't produce one of her own. So it became a bit of a family-free zone. I think that is a huge disappointment,’ the father-of-three said, the Telegraph reported.

Sarah Teather was Britain’s youngest MP – known as the Baby of the House - when elected in 2003 at the age of 29.

But she has admitted a hectic schedule of debates in parliament and constituency surgeries gave her ‘no time’ for a love life.

Born in June 1974, she attended Leicester Grammar School before pharmacology at Cambridge University.

After working as an adviser to Macmillan Cancer Relief, she became a councillor in Islington before entering the Commons defeating Labour in a by-election in Brent.

Speaking in 2004, she admitted that the pressure of being an MP took its toll on her social life.

‘It's very hard to meet up with friends,’ she told the BBC. ‘I'm trying to make an effort to routinely book people in, but I have to diarise it with them, because if I don't, it doesn't happen.’

Asked if lifestyle had put paid to thoughts of a boyfriend, she replied. ‘No time. Not currently.’

A staunch Catholic, she voted against the coalition’s plans for same sex marriage, to to anger of many fellow Lib Dems.

The extraordinary remarks were immediately condemned by the Lib Dems.

Liberal
Democrat equalities minister Miss Swinson said: 'Tim Loughton is 
talking absolute rubbish. Sarah Teather was a brilliant minister.

'She
was pivotal in ending the disgraceful practice of child detention for 
immigration purposes, she successfully won more money for schools to 
help the poorest children, and her work to create a better system of 
support for children with special educational needs has been widely 
praised.

'She has a 
ministerial record to be proud of. Using someone's lack of children as 
an insult is shameful, crass and, frankly, disgusting. It reflects far 
more on him than on Sarah.'

A
senior Lib Dem source said: ‘'I know he's angry about being sacked, but
he needs to gather whatever dignity he has left and shut up.

‘Being a father appears not to have improved his own abilities as a minister, or a human being.’

The staunch defence of Miss Teather, 39, came after she criticised Nick Clegg’s leadership, announcing she was quitting as an MP after feeling ‘desolute’ at government policy on immigration and welfare.

As the row erupted, Mr Loughton insisted he was referring to Miss Teather’s failure to produce a family policy.

Writing
on Twitter, he added: ‘Hold on-if some journo distorting my comments on
LDem family policy in2 personal attack on Sarah Teather v sorry but not
intended & not fair.

‘Blimey-what
am I being panned for now? My criticism was lack of LibDem family 
policy not of Sarah Teather personally who I always respected.’

Speaking
at the Conservative Renewal conference at the weekend, Mr Loughton 
blamed the ‘herd instinct’ of rioters in 2011 on the number of children 
borne out of wedlock.

‘Many 
hard working traditional families have been facing some pretty tough 
economic times, some pretty tough loss of benefits and tax-breaks at our
hands, and these by and large are our supporters and our people.

‘We have failed them to a large degree,’ he said.

Minister: Miss Teather, pictured with Business Secretary Vince Cable, was a served int he Department for Education from 2010 to 2012

Mr Loughton has been in a war of words with the education department run by Michael Gove since losing his job.

His
former colleagues, writing anonymously on Twitter, jibed that Mr 
Loughton was displaying ‘typical judgement and character’ and told him 
‘you never had judgement worth a damn.’

Labour
equalities spokeswoman Kate Green said: ‘It is highly inappropriate to 
be putting people's personal circumstances and private choices into 
public play in that way. It is a pretty unpleasant intrusion and I hope 
Tim Loughton will apologise.’
