Careworn: This self-portrait of Rembrandt included in the exhibition shows him in the autumn of his life, greying, fraying at the edges, but more daring, brilliant and defiant than ever

The bearded art critics of Amsterdam had little to say in praise of Rembrandt van Rijn — and he had nothing good to say about them.

After one particular savaging, Rembrandt vented his spleen on a page of his sketchbook. He drew a caricature of an art critic, a man with the ears of a donkey and a snake winding up one arm, sitting on a barrel of grog. 

As far as he was concerned, the critics were as poisonous as vipers and had all the intelligence of a drunken ass.

Whatever the insults Rembrandt suffered in his lifetime, the critics saved their worst for after his death. One former pupil wrote that Rembrandt’s paint ‘runs down his work like dung’, another that it looked as though the colour had been smeared on with a bricklayer’s trowel and that his canvases were so thickly encrusted you could pick them up off the floor ‘by their nose’.

While he lived, Rembrandt must have found the abuse he suffered particularly galling because the critics had nothing but praise for his rival Peter Paul Rubens, 29 years his senior. 

Rubens was feted at the courts of kings and dukes across Europe. He was ‘the prince of painters and the painter of princes’, according to one English ambassador.

Rembrandt, on the other hand, was king of the dungheap.

Still, he had the last laugh. Who now remembers the names of the carping critics Arnold Houbraken and Gerard de Lairesse?

Rembrandt’s paintings hang in the collections of the world’s greatest museums. Three million visitors a year see his monumental Night Watch, which takes up an entire wall of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

Later artists worshipped him. Vincent van Gogh wrote that his paintings were ‘fathomlessly deep’ and that the artist was a ‘magician’.

This week, his Portrait Of A Man With Arms Akimbo will be auctioned in London for an estimated £30.4 million — a record asking price for the artist’s work.

He would have been grateful — gobsmacked even — to have earned such sums in his lifetime. 

The Rembrandt who looks out at you from the walls of the National Gallery’s new blockbuster exhibition, which opened this week, is a careworn bankrupt.

Every unpaid bill, every bailiff’s knock, every crash of the gavel as his possessions were auctioned off to the highest bidder, is there in his heavy eyes, his parchment skin, his doleful, turned-down mouth. His forehead is as narrowly lined as a map of Amsterdam’s canals.

This is Rembrandt in the autumn of his life, greying, fraying at the edges, but more daring, brilliant and defiant than ever.

It is a dazzling show. The galleries are dimly lit, but such is Rembrandt’s alchemy that his paintings have a light of their own. It is as if a candle is burning behind each canvas.

He has an eye for sumptuous surfaces: an ostrich-feather fan that makes you want to reach out and fluff its plumes; a breast plate gone rusty in the rain of the battlefield; a lustrous pearl bracelet.

Past the first flush of youth himself, he paints old age with an extraordinary intensity.

His portrait of 78-year-old Margaretha de Geer may show her tiny and shrunken with age, but this wealthy merchant’s wife fixes the viewer with a fierce, shrewd look. 

Her sparrow’s head looks like a single bean in the middle of her enormous, platter-like white ruff.

Her husband, the 85-year-old Jacob Trip, is painted in an ornate robe which isn’t like fabric at all, but a cloud of sulphur vapour. 

It is a bravura bit of visual trickery, this greatest of artists showing what he can do.

By 1650, the year from which this exhibition charts his work, Rembrandt was a man who had been beaten about by life — though he gave as good as he got.

His adored wife Saskia, whose wheatfield curls he had delighted in painting, had died of tuberculosis. He had buried three of their babies and was left to bring up his son Titus alone.

His domestic arrangements were a mess. He had taken his son’s nurse Geertje as his mistress, then fallen in love with his housekeeper Hendrickje.

When he wanted Geertje out, he behaved monstrously. He tried to pay her off, and when she wouldn’t go quietly, he leaned on friends to spread malicious rumours that she was insane.

He had her sent to a Spinhuis — a house of correction — where women who were ill, abandoned or criminal spun wool in freezing rooms while overseers preached the Scriptures.

Rembrandt may have freed himself from Geertje, but his debts were harder to shake off.

He was a paradoxical creature: a miser and a spendthrift. He was such a pinchpenny that his students would paint coins on the floor and snigger when he scrabbled to pick them up, and at the same time so extravagant that he ran up debts that would ruin him.

When he bought a house in one of Amsterdam’s most fashionable streets for a massive 13,000 guilders, he took out risky loans and lied to his creditors to finance it.

He had a magpie’s eye for fine things. When the debt collectors made an inventory of his possessions after his bankruptcy in 1656, they found busts of Roman emperors, prints, paintings, fossils, rare minerals and natural curiosities, among them a stuffed armadillo.

After losing his grand townhouse, Rembrandt cared less and less about keeping up appearances to impress clients. Unlike Rubens, the princely flatterer, Rembrandt didn’t fawn over his patrons. 

He wore his paint-splattered smock, his breath smelled of stale beer and by middle-age his teeth were rotten.

In the long economic depression that followed the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1652-54, those who had managed to hold on to their money were loath to spend it on a painting by a grubby bankrupt.

It was in this period of darkness, though, that Rembrandt produced some of his most luminous work. 

He became more devil-may-care and stubbornly self-confident, slapping paint onto the canvas like a butcher laying out steaks on a marble slab. But the results, far from crude, were endlessly subtle.

He painted a self-portrait, which hangs in the first room of the exhibition, in which he is wrapped in a gold mantle. It is as if he is announcing: ‘I have the Midas touch.’

How could anyone have accused Rembrandt of painting with dung? These paintings turn clod colours into gold. Even in the National Gallery’s basement, they glow.

In one of the self-portraits in the exhibition, Rembrandt stands in his studio, his shoulders square to us, his gaze steady and challenging.

With his fur-trimmed robe and curious white cap, he looks like a magus about to cast a spell.

But he doesn’t need anything as flash or ridiculous as a wand. He holds in his hand the secret to his own sort of magic: an old palette and a handful of brushes loaded with paint.
