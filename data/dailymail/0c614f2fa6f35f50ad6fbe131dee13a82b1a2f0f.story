Sen. John McCain grew agitated Tuesday as he tried to defend his immigration plan before an angry crowd in suburban Phoenix who charged that reforms were moving too slowly.

'There are 11 million people living here 
illegally,' McCain, R-Ariz., said in response to members of the crowd who urged mass deportation of illegal 
immigrants. 'We are not going to get enough buses to deport them.'

McCain accused one man in the audience of not 'telling the truth' about illegal immigrants and added, 'They mow our lawns, they care for our babies, they clean, they wash up. That's what those people do, sir.'

Arizona resident Keith Smith shouted back at McCain, 'Cut off their welfare and all their stuff and they'll go back!'

'You said build the dang fence!' Smith added. 'Where's the fence?'

McCain turned his back to the crowd and pointed at a graph and the man shouted at him, 'That's not a fence!'

McCain snapped back: 'It's a banana. We've put up a banana without about $600 million dollars worth of appropriations.'

McCain said immigration reform should be 
contingent on better border security that must rely largely on 
technology able to detect border crossings. He said a tamper-proof Social Security card would help combat identity 
fraud, and noted any path to citizenship must require immigrants to 
learn English, cover back taxes and pay fines for breaking immigration 
laws.

Audience members shouted out their disapproval.

One
man yelled that only guns would discourage illegal immigration. Another
man complained that illegal immigrants should never be able to become 
citizens or vote. A third man said illegal immigrants were illiterate 
invaders who wanted free government benefits.

'This is an overwhelming experience,'
McCain said to one agitated questioner, telling him to sit down. 
'You've had enough time, sir. You've had enough time.'

McCain urged compassion. 'We are a 
Judeo-Christian nation,' he said. He added that the border near Yuma is 
largely secure, but he said smugglers are using the border near Tucson 
to pump drugs into Phoenix.

McCain's second town hall meeting took 
place in Green Valley, south of Tucson.

A bipartisan group of senators — 
including Arizona Republicans McCain and Jeff Flake — want assurances on
border security as Congress weighs what could be the biggest changes to
immigration law in nearly 30 years. Arizona is the only state with both
of its senators working on immigration reform in Congress, a sign of 
the state's widely debated border security issues.

Immigration
activists and elected officials say it's only natural for Arizona to 
continue to take the forefront in the national conversation on 
immigration after years of internal debate on the topic.

'There are 11 million people living here illegally,' McCain said. 'We are not going to get enough buses to deport them'

'No
state in this country has had more experience with enforcement-only 
immigration laws than Arizona,' said Todd Landfried, executive director 
of Arizona Employers for Immigration Reform, which opposes the state's 
tough immigration laws.

While McCain defended his proposals to town hall meetings, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano
toured the border near Nogales with the highest-ranking official at 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the incoming chairman of the 
Senate's homeland security committee and an Arizona congressman. 
Napolitano, Arizona's former governor, said afterward that comprehensive
immigration reform will strengthen the nation's border against 
criminals and other threats.

Arizona gained international recognition as an epicenter of the U.S. immigration debate when it passed its tough anti-immigrant law in 2010. A handful of other states — including Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah — have since adopted variations of Arizona's law.

Arizona has the nation's eighth-highest population of illegal immigrants, according to the Pew Research Hispanic Center. In 2010, illegal immigrants represented roughly 6 percent of the state's population.

Activists said Arizona's 
anti-immigrant laws inspired many illegal immigrants to demand more 
rights. Last week, some college students rallied outside Arizona Gov. 
Jan Brewer's office for driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.

'They
no longer are afraid to come and say, 'I am not able to vote, but I can
make my voice heard, and they have to listen to me,'' said community 
organizer Abril Gallardo.

A report released in January showed the U.S. Border Patrol's Tucson sector remains the busiest along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Tucson sector accounted for 38 percent of all drug seizures and 37 percent of all apprehensions along the border.

Brewer said last week the border cannot be declared safe until the people living near it feel secure from drug and human trafficking.

But Democratic Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona told Latino and black community leaders at a Phoenix luncheon Tuesday that Arizonans need to spread the word on how much more secure the border has become.

'There are lots of folks who don't live in Arizona who have no idea what the border is like,' Sinema said.
