First they were accused of stealing jewellery and mobile phones, now soldiers sent in to clear attackers from Nairobi’s Westgate Mall appear to have been filmed rifling cash registers.

With terrorists were cornered in one part of the building, CCTV footage shows soldiers filling shopping bags with money, returning to collect more after dropping their loot out of sight.

During the siege, Jewellery, watch and mobile shops were emptied, while ATMs, banks and a casino also lost funds.

One witness told The Associated Press he saw a Kenyan soldier take cigarettes out of a dead man's pocket.

Kenya's Star newspaper - which has seen the footage - said it indicates the looting started after the army took over the Westgate operation from the police.

Carts full of goods were left standing in the mall as shoppers fled for their lives when jihadi terrorists rushed the building and started gunning down customers.

Shopping trolleys were abandoned and bags dropped on the floor as people ran screaming from the massacre which left 67 people dead and dozens more missing.

Kenyan Presidential Spokesman Manoah Esipisu said that the video footage 'would definitely be investigated' as part of an inquiry announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta.

'I have not seen that particular footage, but I can say that it and all other CCTV will form part of the commission of inquiry.'

In the video, a soldier who has removed his army regulation beret tips the contents of a supermarket cash register into a bag while another holds it open, reported the Star.

He then collects another register which he also empties into the bag. 

A soldier is later seen walking out of the supermarket with two big bags in the direction of the basement.

He returns and is then seen strolling around the supermarket looking at the shelves.

The paper reported that the video was timestamped September 21, the first day of the assault.

More CCTV footage from the siege shows four of the armed attackers in an office on the mall's second floor.

One man's right foot is injured, they are all sweating, and appear panicked.

Several minutes later one attacker attends to the injured man and another holds his weapon facing the door while a fourth man is seeking peering out the window.

Police are presently splicing together all of the CCTV footage to help them reconstruct what happened.

The terrorists entered Westgate Mall shortly after noon on a busy Saturday, firing guns and throwing grenades. The attackers held off Kenya's military and controlled at least parts of the mall for four days.

Somali extremist group al-Shabab has claimed responsibility

The mall now has a gaping three-story hole in it from the siege.

Almost a week after the attack ended, more than three dozen people remain unaccounted for, the head of the Kenyan Red Cross said Monday.

The government contends there are no remaining missing people.

'The only way to verify this is when the government declares the Westgate Mall 100 per cent cleared. Then we can resolve it,' Red Cross head Abbas Gullet said.
