A man shot and killed by Los Angeles police on Friday night in Hollywood regularly dressed up as the villain from the horror movie series Scream in order to pose with tourists in return for money, according to people who claim they knew him.

LAPD have yet to release the man's name but they have described him as a young, white adult male.

Two Los Angeles police bicycle officers shot and killed the man just before 7 p.m. on Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue after someone called 911 to report a man with knife.

He is not believed to have been dressed as the Scream villain when he was shot.

Deputy Chief Terry Hara said the suspect was threatening the crowd and the officers and was carrying a 3- to 4-inch folding knife.

Cops fired several rounds, leaving his body laying on a corner as shocked witnesses looked on.

The shooting occurred just a few hundred feet from the Dolby Theater, where the Academy Awards are held, and one of the most popular tourist spots in Hollywood.

But some locals are saying the man was merely a street performer known as 'J' who would pose with tourists holding a prop knife made of plastic.

Danny Howe, who sings on Hollywood for tips, said he saw the man three or four days in the past week working as the 'Scream' character for photo tips.

Scene: The officers (pictured), who have not been named, were called to the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and North Highland Avenue on Friday evening after receiving a report of an assault with a deadly weapon

Weapon: When they arrived at the scene, they found a man wielding a weapon - belived to be this thick silver knife, pictured - and shortly after, fired at least one round at him, the police's Media Relations Office said

'He scares people for a living,' he told KPCC. 'It kind of makes you wonder that if you scare people for a living, the cops are going to come.'

The area of Hollywood Blvd where he was killed is near the famous Walk of Fame and is renowned for its street performers who dress up in costumes and play roles to the amusement of tourists.

Many of the performers dress up as characters from Hollywood movies, who pose with tourists for photos in exchange for tips.

The man shot was said to be impersonating the character from Scream, a 1996 horror movie, about a masked man with a knife who murders teenagers with a knife as pictured below.

LAPD is not releasing any information on the shooting, except for tweeting a picture of a folding knife laying near the body, perhaps a Swiss Army Knife, carried by boy scouts everywhere.

More than a thousand protesters dressed in black clothes marched up and down Hollywood Boulevard Saturday night to protest against the police shootings.
