Modern England comes as a shock to most Westminster persons. The former Tory MP Matthew Parris was so appalled when he visited Clacton that the resulting article was used in Ukip propaganda in the by-election there. Mr Parris appeared to be looking down a very long nose indeed at that town’s people and their lives. It didn’t seem to cross his mind that he – as a politician, broadcaster and influential journalist – might have helped to make it like that.

At first glance, Rochester is not much like Clacton. It is an ancient cathedral city you might have glimpsed and wondered about as you took the Eurostar to Paris, or the M2 to Dover, and saw its Norman keep and ancient spire in the middle distance.

Its High Street is a glory of old-fashioned Englishness, a chapter from Charles Dickens in brick, stone, timber and plaster. Almost every enterprise is named after a Dickens character. At this time of year, when the dusk begins to fall quite early, and the yellow lights come on behind the small panes of glass, it is so moving and evocative I almost stopped breathing at the sight of it.

BYGONE AGE: The town of Rochester looks like something out of a Dickens novel 

But then Dickens and his books are real to me. The place must be as mysterious as Japan to most modern English people, for whom Dickens is a firmly closed book. It is also, like so much of picturesque England, a museum where you can buy and eat the exhibits.

Strood lacks these luxuries. While Rochester is marinated in history and literature, Strood is just there, an unremarkable place where the English have lived in reasonable prosperity and freedom for centuries. It is possible Dickens was thinking of Strood when he named his last, unfinished book The Mystery Of Edwin Drood (which rhymes with Strood). But he actually set it in Rochester.

It certainly has a past. Its people must have seen the smoke and heard the guns in 1667 as the Dutch fleet sailed up the Medway to nearby Chatham and burned or seized the pride of the British Navy, a national humiliation now almost completely forgotten, but once considered a grave warning to any British government which neglected the Navy, as Charles II did then and we are doing now.

Cross the now-peaceful Medway to Strood and you are in the real world of fast food, cut-price supermarkets, charity shops, a pound store, amazing numbers of hairdressers (does Britain have enough hair to go round all these establishments?) the usual riot of architecture-free concrete shops, anti-pedestrian fencing and wide, fast highways whose pelican crossings are so slow to change that you could easily forget why you wanted to cross the road in the first place.

This is just standard semi-urban southern England, a few ghostly older buildings surviving amid the post-1960s modernisation which turned so much of the country into a pallid and unsuccessful copy of the less appealing parts of the USA, with a hint of East Berlin thrown in.

In Rochester, the Ukip office had been full of optimism and busy-ness. People were coming up to Ukip candidate Mark Reckless in the street to offer encouragement.

But in Strood, despite the autumn sunlight, I found a curious angry apathy. A few weeks ago, in Scotland, everyone I spoke to about the referendum had an articulate opinion on ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. All planned to vote, none resented the process.

In Strood, my wholly unreliable and unscientific sample was the polar opposite. They were a very English sample – not a Pole or a Somali to be seen. After a while I began to dread asking anyone his views, and to wonder if I was the victim of an elaborate trick, and they were all actors hired by Downing Street to confuse me.

Almost everyone I talked to in Strood (I took up station close to KFC and not far from Morrisons) was disillusioned to the point of cynicism. I can’t disapprove of this on principle. I am a hardened non-voter, and can’t remember when I last bothered to cast a ballot in the safe Labour seat where I dwell. But if I lived in Rochester or Strood I should certainly vote next week, because it seems to me, on this rare occasion, it would make a difference.

If the Tories can’t hold Rochester, politics in this country will change deeply and forever. If they do hold it, politics in this country will remain the same. That’s quite an incentive to vote – whatever way you feel. I’m still amazed by the Prime Minister’s direct appeal to Labour supporters to vote Tory, which they are as likely to do as they are likely to tandoori and eat their grannies.

But in many cases, this is a crossroads that ordinary human beings aren’t even interested in visiting. People told me they were sick of immigration, sick of low wages, sick of false promises. I said that in that case Ukip was their ideal party, but they said that no, it wasn’t.

They had heard of it. They knew what it was, but they didn’t trust it. Some thought the whole election was a waste of money. Others were just hopelessly confused, the most perplexed being an enthusiastic Green Party supporter who suddenly launched into a diatribe of dislike against Eastern Europeans.

It was a reminder that, for many people, politics is as baffling, distant, pointless and uninteresting as sport is to me.

Now, I respect opinion polls. They are generally right, provided you read them carefully and remember that they are a device for influencing opinion much more than a way of measuring it. And I respect the judgment of political professionals on the spot, whose unvarying view is that the Tories are not doing well in Rochester and Strood.

So I expect Ukip will win, not least because I personally will be glad if they do. I am amazed it has taken so long for ordinary Tory supporters to see through their party and particularly through David Cameron, an unusually transparent snake-oil salesman, even for these times.

But the polls can’t really cope with the kind of people I talked to in Strood. These are the great unmoved, the people who neither speak nor vote – the biggest political party in Britain, if anyone could mobilise them. I am surprised that they remain unstirred.

Yet others are stirred. If Ukip win on Thursday, it will be first because the Tory circle cannot be squared. The Tories cannot win new voters without driving away just as many old ones. And they cannot shake off the hatred which clings to them from the Thatcher years.

Second, it will be because those who pinned false hopes on Margaret Thatcher in 1979, and then pinned equally false hopes on Anthony Blair in 1997, are turning once again to someone who looks and sounds as if he knows what to do about a country in deep trouble.

If that is so, then next May’s General Election will mark the boundary between the long, settled Labour-Tory era and a new period of groping and uncertainty.

Political parties take a long time to die, and they can still kick and bite quite hard while they are expiring.

Rochester and Strood won’t mark the end of this long process, but it might well accelerate it quite sharply. I daren’t go further than that. I have no great expectations. But as all readers of Dickens know, such expectations can turn out to be deeply misleading, or worse.
