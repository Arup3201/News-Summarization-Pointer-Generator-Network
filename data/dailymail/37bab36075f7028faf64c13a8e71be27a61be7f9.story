A Bitcoin ATM has been wrecked by a lightning bolt just days after it was introduced.

The $1,000 machine was the first in its state when it went into service with much fanfare two weeks ago at a used books and music store in Tucson, Arizona.

But only about a dozen people bought any of the virtual 'crypto-currency' before nature intervened - striking Bookmans Entertainment Exchange and creating a power surge on Friday.

Out of service: This Bitcoin ATM, pictured during its launch last week on a local TV station, has been knocked out of action after lightning struck the used books and music store which hosted it in Tucson, Arizona

Devastated: Brian Williams, the founder of Javelin Investments LLC, insisted no accounts were compromised. Mr Williams is pictured during the launch of the automated teller on local network Tucson News Now last week

Since then the machine has been out of action and its owner Brian Williams is devastated.

The entrepreneur, who founded the machine's owner Javelin Investments LLC, had hoped the teller would prompt a digital currency revolution in the southern state. 

He told AZ Central: 'It's kind of like getting punched in the face. I'm trying to pick up the pieces, trying to figure out where we are at.'

To use the machine, which Mr Williams hopes to get back up and running within a week, customers had to download a Bitcoin app to their phone.

The app presented them with a QR code which matched up to their unique 'digital wallet' and simply had to be scanned by the teller to gain access.

Customers then fed dollar bills into the machine to convert them into the currency - which critics warn is highly unstable as it has no centralised controls.

Virtual currency: Bitcoin was founded in 2009 using open-source software and has risen hugely in value. The 'coins' pictured - created to popularise the currency - are merely tokens. The real value is in the virtual world

The virtual money's value is determined by no government, instead being set by a peer-to-peer network of mainly anonymous users.

Its origins are shrouded in mystery, part of the reason many established investors distrust it. The currency was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 but that is not his real name - he was anonymous.

The inventor released the coding for his currency in open-source form, and users can now create their own bitcoins.

This happens through a process called mining, which forces computers to solve algorithms so complex that the amount of power they take up limits how much currency can flood the market.

Its value works just like any undefinable commodity, with the same potential pitfalls.

In one of the most famous price bubbles, tulips took on enormous value in 17th Century Amsterdam with lovers of the flowers remortgaging their houses before the price suddenly collapsed.  

One bitcoin is worth around $580, but most of the customers in Tucson withdrew only small amounts.

For the one customer who bought an entire Bitcoin, Mr Williams had to abandon his normal process and conduct the sale using laptops, according to AZ Central.

The lightning bolt prompted amused reactions on Bitcoin forums.

One lover of the virtual currency wrote: 'That's it boys, Bitcoin is done. Zeus has weighed in on cryptocurrency and found it not worthy. Time to sell.'

Another put simply: 'I think we can blame the Illuminati.'

Mr Williams insisted no accounts were compromised by the lightning strike. 

Founded in 2009, the virtual currency has created a small circle of young millionaires who invested early on.

But it is highly controversial because of its lack of controls and dramatically volatile value.

Its origins in anonymous peer-to-peer networks prompted it to be used on the less respectable side of the web - including the 'Deep Web' drugs and weapons trading site Silk Road.

Bitcoin's price stayed relatively low for its first three years but soared towards the end of last year, making headlines around the world.

At its peak at the beginning of December, a single Bitcoin was worth $1,147 - up from $13 a year earlier - prompting the launch of an array of trading and analysis sites.

The price has since stabilised, but the attention enjoyed by the virtual currency also attracted the wrong kind of fans.

A series of websites reported their Bitcoin stores had been raided by hackers as cyber-criminals sought to took advantage of the currency's raging popularity.

Spike: Bitcoin's price rocketed in the last three months of last year, earning it headlines around the world

The world's first Bitcoin ATM was launched in October in Vancouver, Canada, and more than 100 are thought to have sprung up around the globe since.

It is now accepted by dozens of firms including Amazon, Subway, Victoria's Secret, OkCupid, Whole Foods and Sears.

But regulators in the U.S. and Europe warn the currency's days as a free-flowing, unmonitored entity are numbered.  

Gareth Murphy, of the Central Bank of Ireland, told a major summit this month that Bitcoin's creators and traders would have to follow rules similar to those faced by banks.

He said: 'I would urge this industry to work actively to address the concerns of financial authorities rather than "playing cat and mouse" and eventually, and inevitably, being drawn into the regulatory net.'
