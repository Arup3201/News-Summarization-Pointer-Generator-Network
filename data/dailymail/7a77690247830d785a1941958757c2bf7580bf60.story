Jessica Bradford was diagnosed with cervical cancer at the age of 18 - after doctors told her she had an STI

A teenager told the cervical cancer invading her body was nothing more than an STI is today clinging to hope of one day becoming a mother after doctors froze her eggs.

Hairdresser Jessica Bradford visited doctors five times before a correct diagnosis was made, with one GP telling her she was too young to have the disease.

The 18-year-old has had 10 of her eggs successfully frozen, after starting aggressive radiotherapy to treat a cancerous growth found on her cervix.

But the teenager and her mother Julie Bradford, from Rhymney, are campaigning to lower the age when women are first screened for cervical cancer in the hope more young people will be diagnosed at a early stage.

When Jessica noticed abnormal bleeding in December last year, she visited her doctor.

The teenager was told she had thrush and was prescribed antibiotics.

But when her symptoms persisted, Jessica returned to the doctors.

She was diagnosed with a bacterial infection before a GP told the trainee hairdresser her symptoms were most likely the result of a sexually transmitted infection.

Taking matters into her own hands, Jessica researched the symptoms online.

Fearing her condition was more sinister and suspecting cervical cancer was to blame, Jessica visited her doctors again.

But the teenager was told at the age of 18 she was too young to be suffering the disease.

A series of tests, scans and biopsies finally confirmed the teenager's worst fears.

Jessica is one of the youngest women in Britain to be diagnosed with cervical cancer - women are not normally scanned for it until they are at least 20.

But Jessica and her mum, also a hairdresser, are now campaigning for the age to be lowered in the hope that other teenagers could be diagnosed early.

In February Jessica received another blow. Doctors at Llandough Hospital in Penarth revealed she would not be able to have a child naturally, due to the aggressive treatment she required.

Doctors accelerated her in vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedure to allow for Jessica's eggs to be harvested before her radiotherapy began.

She said: 'I have always wanted a big family in the future so I am very pleased that the treatment was successful.

'IVF treatment normally lasts eight weeks but the doctors have given it to me over two weeks.'

Jessica and her mother Julie are now doing all they can to raise awareness about the importance of spotting symptoms and going to see a doctor early, following Cervical Screening Awareness Week last week.

Cervical Screening Awareness Week (CSAW) s a UK-wide initiative led by Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust.

The trainee hairdresser and her mother Julie Bradford, are calling for the age at which women are first screened for cervical cancer to be lowered from 25. Jessica is today hopeful she will become a mother after doctors harvested 10 of her eggs after revealing the aggressive treatment would leave her infertile

Research released by the Trust shows that 22 per cent of women in the UK still do not attend cervical screenings.

Jessica said: 'I would urge young girls who are putting off their routine smear test to go and get it done quickly.

'For girls who have had clear tests but are still worried, I would encourage them to push for more tests until you get a definite answer to put your mind at rest.'

Her mother, Julie added: 'At the first sign of symptoms, Jessica went to a doctor but the scans showed that the growth was already pretty big.

'If she had left it any longer it would have been too late. Jess is strong-minded and she is positive. I am really proud of her.'

Cervical cancer screenings are only routinely available on the NHS in Wales for women over the age of 25, an age that Jessica believes should be lowered.

She said: 'I want girls to be given smear tests from a younger age so it’s not too late for someone else to be treated.

'I have received such a positive response on social media and think it’s important to raise awareness.'
