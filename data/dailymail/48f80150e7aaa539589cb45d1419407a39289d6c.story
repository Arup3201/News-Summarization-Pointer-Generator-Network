Do you know someone inspirational? The search for the 2013 winner is on

The past year has been a whirlwind for Shelley Gilbert. But ask her the best thing about becoming Daily Mail Inspirational Woman Of The Year 2012 and she will tell you about one little girl.

Like many of the children Shelley works with, the eight-year-old had lost both her parents and was living with her aunt. And, like too many adults in this difficult position, the girl's aunt had long refused any official help and support.

That was until the girl brought her aunt's attention to an article in this newspaper about Shelley and her ground-breaking charity Grief Encounter, which helps counsel families, and especially children, to cope with bereavement.

Shelley recalls: 'She was able to 
persuade her aunt to contact us and we have been helping them for 
several months. I'm pleased to report they have come on in leaps and 
bounds. Not only does the little girl leave our workshops with a smile 
on her face, her aunt has benefitted from being with others in a similar
position.

'If 
it hadn’t been for the attention the Mail brought us, they would be 
suffering in silence, perhaps drowning in pent-up grief.'

Even better, this was just one of hundreds of families who contacted the charity after last year's award. Visits to Grief Encounter’s website rose from 500 to 2,500 a month.

They now have 30 counsellors, 100 volunteers, ten paid part-timers and this week gained their first paid full-time employee.

In February, they moved to a new office in Finchley, North London, which has a drop-in centre.

Worthy winner: Shelley Gilbert is presented with her award by Darcey Bussell. She said the accolade has helped her charity reach even more people

Fundraising has rocketed, too - they made £100,000 more than usual last year, which Shelley attributes to her Inspirational Woman award.

'The more people who hear our message,' says Shelley, 50, 'the closer we get to my goal: a time when my charity isn't needed.

'What we try to do, in essence, is to encourage people to talk about the death of a loved one, rather than attempt to bury the pain.' 

Somewhere in Britain, a child loses a parent every 30 minutes. Thousands more lose a sibling each year. Shelley says children can be brushed aside when tragedy strikes: 'We adults mistakenly assume they do not feel or understand their loss as acutely as adults do.'

She speaks from personal experience - she lost her mother to breast cancer when she was four. Five years later, her father died of a heart attack.

Shelley explains: 'In those days people thought they were protecting me by not talking about it - each time it was days before I was even told of the death.

Understanding: At last year's awards, Shelley met Samantha Cameron, who knows all about the support bereaved families need after losing son, Ivan

'I found myself orphaned, adrift in a world that refused to discuss grief or let me in on the deaths that had changed my whole life.'

Shelley was adopted by her uncle and aunt and got 'three ready-made older brothers'.

She went on to have a happy childhood, but the tragedy still haunted her.

It was this which propelled her into the 'helping professions'.

'Getting the award was such a shock. Suddenly, we had been given a badge of trust, credence'

While looking after her own four 
children - ranging in age from 16 to their late 20s - with businessman 
husband Michael, she trained as a psychotherapist.

In
2003, Shelley published a book, also called Grief Encounter, to help 
families discuss death, and was deluged by requests for more guidance 
and support. She launched her charity in 2004 from her North London 
home.

Over the years, she 
set up a helpline, an interactive website, arranged counselling, 
workshops, family remembrance days and residential camps.

'We present a bereaved family with a 
menu of choices,' she explains. 'They can have one-to-one therapy 
sessions, join in group sessions or both.'

The
charity has attracted support from celebrities such as BBC presenter 
Gabby Logan, who lost her brother as a child, and singer Katherine 
Jenkins, whose father died when she was 15.

Big
Brother star Jade Goody was also in contact before she died: 'We still 
care for her boys, and their dad Jeff Brazier champions our cause.'

Support: The Wells, whose daughter Holly was murdered by Ian Huntley, are one of the many families Grief Encounter have helped

But it was Kevin and Nicola Wells, whose ten-year-old daughter Holly was murdered in Soham in 2002 by school caretaker Ian Huntley, who nominated Shelley for our award.

She says: 'They got to know us because I sent Kevin my book. He has since said he wept tears of relief when we taught him it was OK to grieve for Holly for the rest of his life.'

The Wells's son Oliver was 12 when Holly was killed and they feared he would be left traumatised. The Wells's were one of the first families Shelley helped, telling them it is fine to grieve and that they didn't need to pretend it hadn't happened.

Kevin went on to become a patron of the charity. Shelley says she didn't think 'for a moment' that she'd win the Inspirational Woman Award.

Last November, she met Samantha 
Cameron at Downing Street with four other nominees before a star-studded
ceremony hosted by the Mail at the Marriott Hotel in London's Grosvenor
Square.

She says: 'We felt like film stars at the Oscars. I was impressed by how much time the Prime Minister's wife spent with us.

'Suffering
is a bridge without words: we didn't need to speak about specifics to 
know we understood each other. After all, she lost her own son [Ivan, 
who suffered from cerebral palsy and died aged six] not so long ago.'

At the ceremony, Strictly Come Dancing's Craig Revel Horwood announced Shelley the winner.

'It was such a shock,' says Shelley. 'Suddenly, we had been given a badge of trust, credence.'

Following her award, people contacted the charity in droves, asking for help and volunteering.

And
in the past few months, the charity has secured grants from the 
National Lottery, Lloyds TSB and Children In Need. This has enabled them
to launch a Skype service, allowing people to be counselled over the 
internet.

But the most rewarding achievement of 
all? 'Being asked to speak at my children's old primary school,' she 
says. 'Children have so many questions, such as: "Why won't Mummy come 
back? If God loved her so much, why won't he let her back?"

In need: Jade Goody contacted the charity before her untimely death to ask them to support her two sons

'We are committed to speaking honestly about death - age appropriately, of course.'

As for the children's feedback, Shelley says: 'Sometimes it's the way they look me in the eye, a shy smile when they leave or a little hand suddenly slipped into mine. These unspoken signs of gratitude are the best reward.'

But she insists it's not all doom and gloom - the charity helps children to have fun again after the death of a loved one. Shelley says: 'It's our job to show them it's fine to play; it isn't wrong for them to enjoy themselves.'

Shelley gives the example of a three-year-old girl called Carly.

'I just want to make sure today's bereaved children don't suffer the pain and confusion I did'

'She was clinging to her mum, sobbing when I met her,' she says. 'She had lost her father. Her mother felt she was a bad parent because she couldn't heal her daughter's pain.'

Thanks to Shelley's reassurance - and the chance to meet others in a similar position - Carly's mother is better able to cope and Carly is happier.

Shelley stresses that the positive side of death is it teaches us to cherish every moment. 'Life isn't a dress rehearsal,' she says, with infectious enthusiasm. 'Get out there and live every minute!'

Shelley has won several awards, but says the Daily Mail's Inspirational Woman Of The Year is her most prized. 'It is a clear milestone in my life,' she says. 'Next stop? The Palace! I'd love Prince Harry on board.'

Next March, the charity celebrates its tenth anniversary.

'It seems incredible for someone whose parents' death taught her to fear the future,' says Shelley. 'When the worst happens to you when you’re a child, you learn to dread what's around the corner. Mum or Dad went away and never came back. Now, in the light of our success, I can look forward with pride.'

Despite the sadness in her own childhood, this humblingly determined woman declares she's the luckiest person in the world.

'Not only do I have a wonderfully close family, I get to help others every day,' she explains. 'I just want to make sure today's bereaved children don't suffer the pain and confusion I did.'

Surely that's the very definition of inspirational.
