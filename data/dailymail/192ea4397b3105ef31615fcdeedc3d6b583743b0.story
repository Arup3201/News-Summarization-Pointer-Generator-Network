Susie Wolff's full Formula One debut lasted just four laps and Felipe Massa suffered a huge shunt on a dreadful first morning for Williams at the British Grand Prix. 

Wolff, the first female racer to take to the wheel of a Formula One car at a grand prix weekend in more than two decades, suffered an oil pressure problem after just one flying lap and only 20 minutes into the hour-and-a-half session. 

Just moments later, Massa, in the sister Williams, lost control of his car on the exit of Stowe and crashed into the tyre barrier.

Top of the charts: The Mercedes of Nico Rosberg was quickest in first practice at Silverstone

Massa climbed out of his cockpit, with fortunately only his pride dented, but his Williams team will now face a race against time to get the Brazilian's car ready for the next practice session later on Friday.

It is the second big crash for Massa, who will start his 200th race this weekend, in less than a month after he was submitted to hospital following his 190mph shunt with Sergio Perez at June's Canadian Grand Prix.

As for Wolff, all eyes had been on the 31-year-old Briton, who briefly topped the timesheets before she stopped on track.

She ended the session over eight seconds down on championship leader Nico Rosberg, who was fastest ahead of team-mate Lewis Hamilton.

Wolff will now turn her attentions to the German Grand Prix later this month where she will take part in the opening practice session at Hockenheim.

'It was a really tough day but that's Formula One sometimes,' said Wolff. 'We had an oil pressure problem which cut the engines - the guys are looking at getting it fixed for free practice two.

'I want to say a huge thank you for all the support - it means a lot and really helps. It was wonderful.

'Going out there was the best feeling and although there's been a lot of media around this run, once I had put the helmet on that was the best feeling, and as soon as I had left the pit lane, everything felt good.

'Unfortunately it was a short run but I'm going to look forward to Hockenheim.'

Hamilton was over seven tenths adrift of Rosberg's best time, with the German 29 points clear of his rival ahead of this weekend's race.
