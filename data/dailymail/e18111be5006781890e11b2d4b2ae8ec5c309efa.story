As Gary Rowett continues to lead a united Birmingham City side up the Championship table, the boardroom battle at the club’s owning company intensifies.

A week after it was revealed imprisoned owner Carson Yeung is trying to oust three directors to appoint replacements of his choosing, including his common law partner and bodyguard, Birmingham International Holdings (BIHL) announced it believes a former employee may have misappropriated funds amounting to £2.5million.

While these developments bear little immediate impact on the pitch – indeed Rowett has been able to sign Lloyd Dyer to boost his squad – the escalation of disharmony in Hong Kong could eventually prove deeply undermining.

Imprisoned Birmingham owner Carson Yeung plans to make changes to the Championship side's board

Yeung is hoping to add his common law partner and bodyguard to the Birmingham board

Birmingham owner Yeung was jailed for six years in March 2014 for money laundering 

It is with this uncertainty swirling, that fans of any hue would be wise to keep track, and read Haircuts and League Cups: The Rise and Fall of Carson Yeung.

Written by Daniel Ivery, author of the well-informed Often Partisan blog, and Will Giles, a lawyer based in Hong Kong, the book provides context, fine detail, and measured story-telling to chart the story of Yeung’s life and involvement with Birmingham.

In an age when investors and shysters of different shapes and sizes converge on English football, the forensic attention given by Ivery and Giles to the Yeung story, from hairdresser to high-stakes gambler, is worth absorbing.

A measure of the content can be found by the reaction drawn from Peter Pannu, Birmingham’s one-time chief executive and long-term Yeung confidant.

In December he sent Ivery messages that used physical intimidation and appeared to threaten legal action. More seriously for Birmingham, he alleged the club could be out of business by January over a £1.8m tax bill.

Birmingham, led by director Panos Pavlakis, issued a statement firmly denying the claims, adding: ‘All involved at the club are wholly unimpressed and saddened by the unprofessional and ludicrous actions taken which seem intent on discrediting and damaging individuals and the club.’

Former Burton Albion boss Rowett took over the reins at St Andrews in October 

Shares in BIHL were suspended from trading, and Pannu resigned as a club director. He lost his place on the BIHL board too – but at the AGM a fortnight ago he was re-elected, with Pavlakis ousted, thanks mainly to votes cast by Yeung from behind bars in Stanley Prison.

The next day, however, Pavlakis – whose place at the helm of Birmingham had looked in doubt – was re-appointed with a deciding vote from BIHL chairman Cheung Shing. Status quo restored.

Such boardroom battles have been frequent since Yeung’s arrest in June 2011 – and are much documented in Haircuts and League Cups.

In riposte the news followed that Yeung, who remains the largest shareholder in company and club, wants to call an EGM at BIHL and appoint three associates to the board.

Pavlakis and his faction are eager that the credentials of the individuals satisfy Hong Kong Stock Exchange rules before an EGM is held; doing things by the book. In the same approach, the company reported the discovery of £2.5m misappropriated funds to police, concerned too that auditors had missed the loss.

On Tuesday afternoon, Ivery reported on his Often Partisan website that a 33-year-old, believed to be Jerry Ko – a former compliance officer – has been arrested.

Events in the Far East may feel a long distance away, but they could bring trouble closer to St Andrew’s as the Football League monitors Yeung’s influence. If the 54-year-old continues to exert power at BIHL and force through changes, the knock-on effect might be a shake-up in the Birmingham boardroom.

From that stage, any suspicion Yeung is able to act as a shadow director, against the governing body’s rules given his money-laudering conviction, could lead to severe sanctions: transfer embargoes, point deductions, or, most damagingly, a ban from the Football League completely.

That eventuality would be extreme and is far from probable. But choppy waters may lie ahead for Rowett, who has steered a smooth ship against the odds so far.
