The DJ behind this year’s biggest dance craze claims he hasn’t earned a single cent from the track because of legal issues arising from not having properly cleared samples with the original artists before it was released.

Brooklyn-based DJ Baauer’s track ‘Harlem Shake’ achieved global recognition in February when it became the soundtrack to a series of memes posted on YouTube of people dancing wildly to the song.

The ‘Harlem Shake’ quickly became an internet phenomenon inspiring a raft of other clips of people doing the crazy dance in any number of bizarre situations – in an old folks home, while carrying out Norwegian army drills, while filming a Speedo commercial.

Show me the money: Brooklyn-based DJ Baauer has revealed that he hasn't earned a single cent for his track 'Harlem Shake', which achieved global recognition in February when it became the soundtrack to a series of memes

At its peek, 4,000 'Harlem Shake' videos were being uploaded onto YouTube every day.

The viral success helped push download sales of the song, which charted at number one for five consecutive weeks on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also reached number three in the United Kingdom and number one in both Australia and New Zealand.

But now Baauer – real name Harry Rodrigues – has spoken out about the downside of having such an unexpected smash.

The 24-year-old DJ and producer created the track in his bedroom and since he wasn’t planning for such a runaway success he didn’t seek clearance from the two artists who he sampled without permission.

Even though the track had been around since May 2012, it was only after it had gained global success, that Baauer and his record label - Mad Decent - received lawyer's letters on behalf of the sampled artists - reggaetón artist Hector Delgado and Philadelphia rapper Jayson Musson.

Now despite record label boss Diplo having previously said that an agreement had been reached to clear the samples, Baauer has said he is still waiting to be paid.

‘I’m meeting with my lawyer tomorrow for lunch, so I’m gonna find that out (why he hasn't been paid). I think it’s mostly because of all the legal s**t,' he told Pitchfork.

'I didn’t clear the samples because I was in my f***ing bedroom on Grand Street. I wasn't going to think to call up [Delgado], I didn’t even know who it was who did that [sample]; I knew the Jayson Musson [sample]. So I found myself in that f***ing pickle. Legal letters and s**t.

'Ugh. Lawyers. So exposure-wise it was fantastic, but everything else...,’ he told them.

While Baauer may not have received any money yet from downloads of his track, it certainly has helped to further his reputation and will undoubtedly have helped raise the fee he charges for appearing at clubs and music festivals.
