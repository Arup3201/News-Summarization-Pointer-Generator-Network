An Alitalia jet toppled and skidded off the runway at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport last night after one of its landing gears failed to open in a storm.

It is understood about ten passengers suffered minor cuts and bruises when the plane crash landed before sliding to a halt after a flight from Madrid.

The Italian news agency ANSA quoted officials saying the ten 'code green' injuries were treated at the airport.

'Code green': It is understood about ten passengers suffered minor cuts and bruises when the plane crash landed before sliding to a halt after a flight from Madrid

Trouble in a storm: The pilot radioed Rome's air traffic control tower to say he was experiencing trouble deploying the plane's right wheel as he came in to land

It said the pilot radioed Rome's air traffic control tower to say he was experiencing trouble deploying the plane's right wheel as he came in to land.

The airport's operations room said the Airbus 320 landed on the tarmac leaning on a wing and its tail after the right-side landing gear did not work.

It said all 151 passengers and the 
crew of five left the plane safely through emergency slides after the 
pilot reported the problem.

The cause of the malfunction is being investigated.

Minor injuries: The Italian news agency ANSA quoted officials saying the ten 'code green' injuries were treated at the airport

In February an Alitalia aeroplane which veered off a runway after landing in strong winds was re-painted white to conceal the airline's insignia to avoid bad publicity.

The ATR-72 turboprop plane, which belonged to Romanian carrier Carpatair but was leased by Italian carrier Alitalia, was re-painted to protect the brand's reputation, officials have said, causing anger among unions.

Displaying the Alitalia colours and logo, the plane, which was traveling from Pisa-Galileo Airport to Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome, crashed injuring six.

Alitalia argued that the paint job was standard corporate practice to protect brand reputation and operated all over the world.

Meanwhile in California, passengers on board a private jet that crashed into a hanger as it landed at Santa Monica Municipal Airport were not so lucky.

Rescuers and investigators were working amid the smoldering wreckage but they did not expect to find any survivors from the flight from Idaho with an unknown number aboard, officials said.

'This was an unsurvivable crash,' Santa 
Monica Fire Department Capt. John Nevandro said at a media briefing 
hours later at Santa Monica Municipal Airport.

Because the hangar collapsed in flames around it and a crane would be required before the plane could be reached, investigators had been unable to determine how many people were aboard the twin-engine Cessna Citation designed to hold eight passengers and two crew members, officials said.

It had taken off from Hailey, Idaho and landed in Santa Monica when it went off the right side of the runway at about 6:20 p.m. and struck the hangar, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said.

The blaze did minor damage to two other buildings and destroyed the hangar.

'It was a total loss,' Fire Department spokeswoman Bridgett Lewis said.
