A mother is being investigated after she left her three sons in a car while she went to the library.

The unnamed woman was trying to finish some financial paperwork in Monroe, Louisiana, on Monday afternoon when her eldest son called 911 and said his mom was being 'mean'.

When the dispatcher asked the boy where he was calling from he promptly told her it was a library but could not remember the name.
