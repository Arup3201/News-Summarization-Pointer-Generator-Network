Regency costumed guests arrived in their dozens for dinner and dancing at the Pride and Prejudice Ball at Chatsworth House yesterday.

Jane Austen, who stayed there while penning her famous novel of the same name, is believed to have based her depiction of the fictional Pemberley, Fitzwilliam Darcy's residence, on the stately home.

Guests turned out in stunning regency attire including full length gowns with classic square necklines and short puff sleeves, made from soft muslin fabrics.

Most dresses were fitted tightly under the bust in a period-perfect empire style and paired with long gloves, which ladies always wore when outside the house.

Gentlemen, meanwhile, dressed up as dandies in so-called 'Wellington boots' - knee-high footwear at the height of regency fashion - perfectly tied silk cravats, waistcoats and dinner jackets.

The ball in Derbyshire staged an evening to remember, celebrating the 201 years since the publication of Pride and Prejudice.

Dubbed the Pride and Prejudice Regency Ball, the soiree began at 7.30pm and ended at approximately 11pm, with tickets costing £85 per person.

The evening began with champagne and canapés 
in the Painted Hall with live entertainment from Lady Georgianna, an 
18th century girl band.

Guests were then invited to tour the North Wing of the house before making their 
way to the Carriage House restaurant to enjoy a sumptuous, themed 
five-course dinner.

Lady Georgianna joined guests at dinner with 
Regency style poems and songs.

With capacity for 100 or more, the 
vast majority of Austen fans turned out in full costume - a key
 point of the ball, though the fancy dress wasn't compulsory.

Jane Austen visited Chatsworth House in 
1811 while staying at the Rutland Arms in Bakewell while writing Pride and Prejudice. The stately home is believed to be her 
inspiration for Pemberley, the residence of the novel's romantic hero 
Mr Darcy.

Austen wrote in the novel: 'The
 eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite 
side of the valley into which the road into some abruptness wound.

'It
 was a large, handsome, stone building standing well on rising ground, 
and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of 
some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any 
artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely 
adorned.'

In the book, lead character Elizabeth 
Bennet meets Mr Darcy for the first time at a similar event to the Pride and Prejudice soiree - but 
takes an immediate dislike to him.

The stately home has been the seat of the 
Dukes of Devonshire since 1549 and is mentioned in Pride and Prejudice 
as one of the stately homes that Elizabeth Bennet visits before arriving at 
Pemberley.

Chatsworth also featured in the 2005 Pride and Prejudice movie starring Kiera Knightley and Matthew Macfayden.

Visitors are encouraged to ponder 
the grand staircase and ceiling of the Painted Hall - where Lizzie and the
 Gardiners start their tour of Pemberley.

The
 Sculpture Gallery - which features the beautiful veiled Vestal Virgin sculpture - was used in the scene where Lizzie Bennet sees the 
bust of Mr Darcy, and his housekeeper describes his many good qualities.

The scene was originally set to
 be in a gallery of paintings, but was changed to make use of 
Chatsworth's collection.

Chatsworth
 has been used as a setting for other Pride and Prejudice themed 
outings, from fans coming to see the locations and enjoy 'Pemberley', to
 themed photography, such as their Pride and Prejudice themed photo shoot.

Known as one of England’s greatest country 
estates, Chatsworth provided the perfect setting to launch the Peak District estate's Georgian Summer 
of events (27 July - 29 August 2013) celebrating the bicentennial anniversary of Austen's novel.
