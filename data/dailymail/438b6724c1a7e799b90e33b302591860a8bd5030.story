As Chanelle Riggan took to the stage at the Miss California pageant, she smiled at the crowd and prepared to walk down the catwalk.

But seconds after Miss Beverly Hills stepped into the limelight for the swimsuit round, her graceful strut was brought to a sudden halt by an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction. 

The top of her pink bikini suddenly came undone, revealing more than the spectators had been expecting.

Saving grace: As spectators watched aghast, she desperately wrapped her towel around her waist and held the top behind her 

In the video, obtained by TMZ, Riggan looks shocked and quickly tries to rearrange herself as the audience gasps.

However the slip up didn't last long, and within seconds she was back into action with her hand grasping the ties behind her back. 

As she tried to get herself together, members of the audience screamed 'keep going'.  

Without missing a beat, she carried on down the runway, turned and grinned at the astonished crowd, before heading off stage.  

Despite the embarrassment, Riggan made it past the swimsuit competition stage and was eventually named fourth runner-up. 

Back up: She manages to maintain her composure after the embarrassment and smiles to the camera
