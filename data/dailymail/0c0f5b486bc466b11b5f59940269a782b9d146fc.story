Police officers in Thailand are ditching the doughnuts and getting back in shape as they are sent to join a boot camp.

About 60 overweight officers are taking part in the 12-day programme that will focus on changing their lifestyle.

And the biggest loser at the end of the programme will win 5,000 Baht, approximately £110.

Bootcamp: Thai police officers take part in a yoga program at a police training center in Bangkok

It includes dawn-t0-dusk exercise and lectures on healthy eating at a police training centre in Bangkok.

The officers wear T-shirts with the slogan ‘Get rid of the belly’ and start their days with pre-dawn jogs, yoga, aerobic dance classes and lessons from nutritionists.

They also do tai chi to reduce stress and improve the body’s blood flow.

Weight in: The officer who loses the most weight at the end of the programme wins 5,000 Baht, almost £110

The cash prize is considered a bonus for underpaid police officers though many say their real motivation is the chance to improve their health.

Sgt. Maj. Wanchat Phonorthong, a 49-year-old traffic officer who at six feet tall weighs almost 21 stone, said: ‘The school children call me `Uncle Fat' all the time, but I don't mind. I'm more concerned about my health, because I have diabetes.

‘I'm going to lose some of my belly because they have me work out every day and they only give me half the food I usually eat. It's torture but I have to do it for myself.’

Annual checkups last year for Thailand's 200,000 police officers showed that the five most common concerns were obesity, high cholesterol, liver problems, high blood pressure and diabetes.

Col. Pornpen Bunnag, who designed the course and heads the Family Medicine Department at Bangkok's Police General Hospital, said: ‘Police officers tend to have higher health risks than some other professions because they don't eat and sleep on a normal schedule.

'Eating at the end of late-night shifts, drinking and smoking all contribute to their obesity.

‘Not only that,’ she said. ‘Their potbellies make them look less sharp in their uniforms.’
