The poster child for what Democrats claim is a GOP 'war on women' lashed out at Hillary Clinton on Wednesday in exclusive comments to MailOnline, calling her 'hypocritical' for defending a child rapist in 1975 and laughing about it in a taped interview.

Former Missouri Republican Rep. Todd Akin crashed and burned in his 2012 bid for a U.S. Senate seat, after claiming that exceptions in abortion bans for rape victims weren't necessary because 'if it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.'

'But let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work or something: I think there should be some punishment,' he said ten weeks before that election, 'but the punishment ought to be of the rapist, and not attacking the child.'

Akin 
emerged from 18 months of media silence to double down on those 
comments, and to blast the leading Democratic presidential contender 
with a blistering verbal salvo.

'Legitimate rape': Todd Akin insists he was right about the rarity of pregnancy caused by rape, and is attacking Hillary Clinton for her role in marginalizing her husband's sexual-assault accusers

Double standard? Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defended the rapist of a 12-year-old girl in 1975, winning him a 'time served' sentence of just two months in jail

Akin says he hasn't rule out running for office again, and may be laying the groundwork with a new book explaining his epic collapse in 2012

'It
 is incredibly hypocritical that Hillary Clinton would carry on about an
 imagined "Republican war on women",' the former six-term congressman 
told MailOnline, 'when she once got a child rapist off the hook who she 
knew to be guilty, and laughed about how she did it when interviewed.'

'In
 the process, she de-legitimized the legitimate claims of the 
12-year-old victim and then slandered the victim to justify her 
tactics.'

Clinton was embarrassed ten days ago when the Washington Free Beacon published an audio interview from the early 1980s in which she chuckled about representing a man who raped a 12-year-old girl.

She knew he was guilty, she said on the recording, but worked the legal system to limit his punishment to 'time served' – about two months in jail.

'I had him take a polygraph, which he passed – which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,' she laughed at the time.

Todd Akin is ending his nearly two years of silence after his comments about 'legitmate rape' ended his U.S. Senate hopes in Missouri, pushing a book and attacking Hillary Clinton in the process

Akin
 complained to MailOnline about a decades-long pattern of Hillary 
Clinton making light of sexual assaults by attacking the victims.

The future first lady ran a legal aid clinic when she 
took the case in 1975. In an affidavit on behalf of Thomas Alfred Taylor, who died in 
1992, she described his child victim as 'emotionally unstable with a 
tendency to seek out older men and engage in fantasizing,' and wrote 
that she had a history of 'false accusations.'

Akin
 pointed to Clinton's actions during her husband's 1992 presidential 
campaign to marginalize women who accused him of sexual abuse, as 
evidence that establishes a pattern.

'She
 hired private 
investigators to silence those women – ‘bimbo eruptions’ in Clintonspeak
 – who had been seduced or sexually assaulted by her husband,' Akin 
told MailOnline.

Those cases involved accusations from women including Paula Jones, who accused the future president of sexually harassing her, and Juanita Broaddrick, who leveled charges that he violently raped her.

'Hillary Clinton, in
 fact, has made a practice of trashing women with legitimate claims to 
having been assaulted,' Akin said.

'I faced a media firestorm for an unclear comment.
 It is the responsibility of the media to make it clear that liberal 
Democrats like Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton are the true 
perpetrators of the ‘war on women.'

Akin, like Clinton, is promoting a book – Firing Back: Taking on the Party Bosses and Media Elite to Protect Our Faith and Freedom – due in stores on July 15.

The book includes a carefully parsed defense of his 'legitimate rape' comment to a television station that doomed his 2012 campaign and brought even GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney out of the woodwork to chastise him.

'When a woman claims to have been raped, the police 
determine if the evidence supports the legal definition of "rape",' Akin writes. 'Is it
 a legitimate claim of rape or an excuse to avoid an unwanted pregnancy?
 Are the police warranted to take action against a crime or not?'

'In 
short, the word "legitimate" modifies the claim and not the action. 
There have been women who have lied about being raped, as Norman 
McCorvey did before the U.S. Supreme Court. The infamous Roe v. Wade 
decision of 1973 was based on a lie.'

'My comment about a woman's body 
shutting the pregnancy down,' Akin adds in the book, 'was directed to the impact of stress on 
fertilization. This is something fertility doctors debate and discuss. 
Doubt me? Google "stress and fertilization," and you will find a library
 of research on the subject.'

'The research is not conclusive, but there 
is considerable evidence that stress makes conception more difficult. 
And what could be more stressful than a rape?'

Akin told MailOnline that he hasn't closed the door on running for office again in the future.

'I have not ruled out the possibility of running for office again in the future, but it is not on my radar at the moment,' he said Wednesday.

Backlash: Akin faced an angry feminist lobby in 2012 after his gaffe became the subject of daily outrage in the press

Crash and burn: Akin's solid lead over Sen. Claire McCaskill evaporated, along with much of his public following, after his shocking gaffe about rape and pregnancy

That position casts his dissection of his 2012 implosion in a different light.

He insists, for instance, that he 
never denied the possibility of pregnancy from forcible rape.

'In
 fact, several fantastic young Americans who campaigned with me were 
themselves the products of rape,' Akin writes. 'And they were thankful I 
would stand with them.'

Akin's full-contact body slam on Hillary Clinton is about what he sees as a double standard. He was pilloried in 2012 for putting his foot in his mouth by answering a hypothetical question, he says, while Clinton has largely escaped criticism for defending Taylor, an actual rapist.

The 12-year-old victim, now a middle-age woman, told The Daily Beast last week that 'Hillary Clinton took me through hell,' adding that she would confront the former secretary of state if she had the chance.

'I would say [to Clinton], "You took a case of mine in '75, you lied on me… I realize the truth now, the heart of what you’ve done to me",' she said.

'And you are supposed to be for women? You call that [being] for women, what you done to me? And I hear you on tape laughing.'

Assaulter-in-chief? Then-President Bill Clinton faced questions from reporters in 1999 after Juanita Broaddrick, an Arkansas woman, accused him of raping her 21 years earlier in a hotel room

Broaddrick gave an NBC News interview in 1999 describing what she said was a brutal sexual assault and Bill Clinton's alleged cavalier attitude afterward

'Bimbo eruption': Hillary Clinton helped tamp down national outrage after a string of women, including Paul Jones (pictured) accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment and sexual assault

Akin writes in 'Firing Back' that two weeks after his 'legitimate rape' comment became national news, 'sexual 
predator' Bill Clinton received a standing ovation 
for his keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention.

At he same convention, he adds, Democrats memorialized Ted Kennedy, whose Chappaquiddick incident brought charges that he let a 
young woman he preyed on drown to save his reputation.

If Akin runs again, he'll need a resurgence of support from Christian evangelicals, many of whom abandoned him in the final weeks of the 2012 campaign.

His book seems calculated, in part, to rebuild that bridge.

'Perhaps one of the greatest opportunities to return to good ideas and refute bad ideas is through the church,' he writes. 'Churches exist in part to warn people of the bad consequences of bad ideas and teach obedience to God’s laws. ... Today, for all the good work our pastors do, many make the mistake of not applying the Bible to the critical issues of our day. This is probably one of the most urgently needed changes in America.'
