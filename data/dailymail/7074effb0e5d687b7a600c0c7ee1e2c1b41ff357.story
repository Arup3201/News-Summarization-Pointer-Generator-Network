The founder of an animal welfare organization that bought NFL star Michael Vick's former dog-fighting compound is facing cruelty charges.

Dogs Deserve Better bought the 15-acre tract and five-bedroom home last year for use as a dog sanctuary for animals who have been chained and penned.

Chief Animal Control Officer Tracy Terry said numerous complaints about the property prompted a visit from the state veterinarian's office in Surry County, Virginia.

The sheriff's office has been unable to find the organization's founder, Tamira Thayne, to serve warrants for animal cruelty and inadequate care of animals.

Vick, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, served 18 months in federal prison in 2008 for his involvement in the Bad Newz Kennels dog-fighting ring that operated from the property.

While serving the search warrant of a 
property owned by Vick in rural Virginia, police discovered evidence of 
an alleged dog-fighting operation, including rape stands, pry bars, 
treadmills modified for dog training, and a blood-stained carpet.

Animal-control officers eventually removed 66 dogs from the property, 55 of which were pit bulls.

He was reviled by fans when he was released from jail in 2009, lost everything and was forced to file for bankruptcy.

However Vick bounced back. Last year, he signed a six-year deal with the Eagles worth $100million, with $40million guaranteed.

In June, he wed his fianc√©e Kijafa Frink at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach in front of 300 people.

Ms Frink and Mr Vick have three children together and have been together for several years, throughout the turmoil of his incarceration.

He even filmed a reality show with BET that chronicled his road to redemption and featured his children Mitez, Jada, and London.
