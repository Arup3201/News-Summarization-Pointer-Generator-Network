Snatched: Two men walked into mother Donna Cooper's house in Lemington, Newcastle, and grabbed her 21-month-old little boy Vinnie

Knife-wielding raiders have stormed a mother's home and tried to snatch her toddler.

The two men walked into mother Donna Cooper's house in Lemington, Newcastle, and grabbed her 21-month-old little boy Vinnie.

With hoods covering their faces and armed with a large knife, the pair confronted Ms Cooper's boyfriend Paul Alexander, before one of them scooped the toddler up and ran upstairs with him. 

The men fled after Mr Alexander chased them and Ms Cooper found Vinnie left unscathed in her bed upstairs. 

But the 33-year-old mother of four is now terrified to let her son out of her sight in fear he could be taken from her.  

Ms Cooper said: 'There aren't any words to describe how I feel.

'I just keep thinking about these strangers putting their hands on my son and I feel sick. They could have done anything to him. 

'Whoever it was thought it was OK to come in here with a knife and pick up my son. I was just so relieved he wasn't harmed.'

The men entered while Ms Cooper was taking her other three children to school on Tuesday morning.

Mr Alexander and Vinnie were downstairs in the house when the men walked in through the unlocked front door around 9.15am.

Mr Alexander said: 'They were wearing hi-visibility jackets and had hoods covering their faces. I thought they were workmen at first, but then I saw one of them was carrying a large kitchen knife.

'Then one of them said, 'Take the bairn (child) out of the room'.

Realising the raiders planned to take Vinnie, Mr Alexander ran into the kitchen to arm himself with a knife, but as he did so one of the men ran upstairs with the toddler before later fleeing through the front door.

Unsure whether Vinnie was still with the men, Mr Alexander chased them, calling the police as he went.

He said: 'I had no shoes on or anything. I just ran out in my bare feet with my phone and a knife. I didn't know what to do, it was so unexpected.

   'I'm totally on edge... I'm constantly looking over my shoulder'

'The whole thing was completely surreal. You hear about things like this, but you don't think it's going to happen to you.'

He then watched as two men got into a red van and drove away at speed, before he returned to the house.

To his relief, Vinnie was still upstairs, tucked up in his mother's bed.

Northumbria Police are appealing for information about the raid and particularly want to talk to anyone who saw a red flat-bed truck in the area.  

Det Sgt Michelle Robson said: 'While no one was injured and nothing stolen, this has obviously left the man and the child distressed. 

'We're making extensive inquiries into this incident and would urge any witnesses to contact police.'

Ms Cooper added: 'I'm totally on edge now and will be until they are caught. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder. These men must have known our routine and known what time I'd be out.'
