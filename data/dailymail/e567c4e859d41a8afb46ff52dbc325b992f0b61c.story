They say you should never meet your heroes and for one little boy, coming within shooting distance of Wayne Rooney proved to be an extremely bad move.

Because nine-year-old Manchester United fan Jamie Thomas - at his first game watching his heroes - suffered a broken wrist when he was struck by a ball hit by the striker.

Jamie was cheering on his idols when the Â£250,000-a-week star miskicked the ball sending it careering into the crowd in Wolverhampton.

The nine-year-old ducked and put his arms across his face to protect himself as the ball came flying towards him - but it clattered into his wrist.

Although the young supporter managed to watch the first 45 minutes of the match he was taken to a first aid centre at half time after his arm ballooned in size.

He was later taken to hospital where he had a plaster cast put on his injured wrist.

Jamie said today: 'It all happened so fast, one minute I was watching Wayne take shots at goal and the next the ball was flying towards me.

'It was coming really fast and I just put my hands up.

'I felt like a rocket had hit my arm but I was buzzing because Wayne had kicked it.

'I thought my arm and wrist was okay but it was getting more painful.'

Despite begging his dad to let him watch the whole game he was whisked away to be treated by first aiders at the ground.

Jamie added: 'I missed most of the second half but it was worth it. I think it's brilliant that Wayne Rooney broke my wrist.

'Everyone at school wanted to sign my plaster cast.'

The Manchester United fan, from Wem, Shropshire, was sitting in the front row for the game against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux last Sunday with his father Andy, 31.

Although England forward Wayne Rooney, 26, did not realise he had injured Jamie, he has since used his Twitter page to say sorry to the schoolboy and promised to send him a personalised gift.

He said in a tweet: 'I want to apologise to Jamie Thomas. I have arranged for a letter and a signed shirt to be sent to his home address.'

Premier League champions Manchester United won the game 5-0.

Jamie's father Andy, who works at a slaughterhouse, said his son was unable to avoid Wayne Rooney's mis-hit shot.

'It was his first Man Utd game and we were in the Wolves end because somebody got us tickets,' he said.

'We were sat on the first row right at the front. We were with my nephew, Jamie's uncle, his sister and her brother.

'The players were warming up and Rooney and (Javier) Hernandez were taking a few shots. Rooney missed one and it was coming straight towards Jamie so he put out his hands to stop it hitting him and it broke his wrist.

'He did well to put his arms up because it would have taken his head off otherwise - it was a hell of a shot.

'At first we thought it was just bruising but Jamie wasn't enjoying the game and it ballooned in size so we went to first aid at half time. We ended up missing most of the second half.'

Andy took his son back to Shrewsbury where he had an X-ray which confirmed the wrist had been broken.

He added: 'They
 said it was a clean break and he has to go back in a couple of weeks. 
'He went back to school on Wednesday and he was loving it, everyone 
wanted to sign his cast.

'He's
 been telling everyone Wayne Rooney broke his wrist. 'He can't write 
with his hand and we are having to help him get changed but he doesn't 
care.

'It shook him up a bit but he's fine about it now and I don't think it's put him off going to other games.'

A spokeswoman for the club said: 'Wayne did not have any idea this had happened. He has now signed a shirt for Jamie and will be writing to him to apologise.'

The lucky supporter has also been promised the chance to meet the Wolves players after being injured at the match.

A club spokesman said: 'We were very sorry to hear about Jamie's injury and the fact it meant he had to miss some of the game - hopefully he can make a speedy recovery and be back watching football soon.

'We have been in touch with the lady who contacted us about the incident and have offered Jamie the chance to come down and meet the players at our training ground.'
