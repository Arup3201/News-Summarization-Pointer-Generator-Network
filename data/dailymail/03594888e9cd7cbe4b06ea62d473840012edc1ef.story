The outfit Lone Ranger actor Clayton Moore wore when making appearances as the character after retiring from TV has sold for $195,000 (£114,000).

The Waco, Texas-based A & S Auction Company said the outfit was sold yesterday.

Moore, who died in 1999, played the masked lawman on the US television series The Lone Ranger from 1949 to 1957 alongside his sidekick Tonto.

The auction house says that after retiring from television, Moore made appearances in character at events including fairs.

His outfit included a powder-blue shirt and pants, red kerchief, Stetson hat, boots, gun belt and Colt pistols.

The outfit spent more than a decade in the collection of a late Texas businessman whose family offered it at auction.

Earl Davis, the son of Robert Davis who owned the outfit, said his father was a collector of historic memorabilia, among them a receipt for beef signed by Colonel William B. Travis as he gathered food before the siege of the Alamo in 1836.

The outfit was not the one used by Moore during the filming of the show, but the one he wore to celebrity appearances after the series finished

Davis told the Waco Tribune that his father bought the outfit 15 years ago at an auction in San Fransisco.

The outfit was part of a Western auction, featuring more than 450 lots including 100 firearms, Navajo rugs, Wild West show artifacts and other antiques.

Other sales of note at the same auction house include a sword belonging to Texas leader Sam Houston for $165,000, a Republic of Texas bronze seal used to stamp land grants, which fetched $47,000, and a 640-acre land grant bearing the name of Neil McLennan, for whom McLennan County is named.
