Network Rail bosses were today accused of overseeing a 'farce' which caused chaos for train passengers during the Christmas holidays.

MPs mocked the admission that equipment brought in to reduce breakdowns itself broke down while passengers were confronted with blank information boards in a communication shambles.

Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne was hauled in front of Parliament after thousands of people were left stranded or in overcrowded stations when engineering works over-ran, with East Coast mainline services into King's Cross and cancellations of services into Paddington.

Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne was challenged by MPs over a lack of contingency planning and poor communication when over-running works caused chaos at Christmas

A damning report last week blamed poor planning, equipment failures and communication breakdowns for the problems at London stations Paddington, King's Cross and Finsbury Park on December 27.

Passengers diverted from King's Cross found Finsbury Park so overcrowded it had to be closed, causing further delays.

Mr Carne was challenged by MPs over why problems mounted, which meant work which should have been finished by Boxing Day ran into problems.

Transport committee chairman Louise Ellman said: 'It does appear that there are elements of farce amongst the chaos.

'The equipment brought in to reduce the risk of breakdowns broke down itself. Safety clearance took five times longer than intended. There was no contingency plan where two stations had closed.

'Passengers were directed to an over-crowded Finsbury Park station.'

She added that many information boards were blank, leaving passengers in the dark.

'That's a picture of chaos,' Ms Ellman added.

Mr Carne began by 'unreservedly apologising' to people who were affected. 'Clearly this was an unacceptable situation for them, they had a very, very difficult day.'

He blamed a number of 'small incidents' which together caused a major problem.

'There was a sequence of small events that escalated in the way that they did.'

The quality of information that was provided to passengers was not adequate, he admitted.

Ms Elmman added: 'The cumulative effect was massive disruption which affected thousands of people over a very busy holiday period.'

Work starting on Christmas Day at Holloway Junction, north of King's Cross, included replaced two junctions and around 500m of track.

By the evening of Christmas Day the project was already six hours behind after new equipment dsigned to prevent breakdowns failed.

The Network Rail report said last week: 'The equipment failures were unexpected, due to the provision of new hardware that had been bought specifically to reduce the risk of breakdown.

'However this new hardware had not been tested in the railway environment before deployment, and t not reliable when put to use.'

Services which did manage to run on December 27 that ran were massively overcrowded and delayed, while suburban Finsbury Park station failed to cope with the crowds. 

Some services were ushered into King's Cross by staff waving red and yellow flags. 

Network Rail admits that there was no choice but to send passengers to the 'entirely unsuitable' station at Finsbury Park. 

But NR network operations managing director Robin Gisby told MPs: 'It was the right decision to use Finsbury Park (as the terminus) and I would endorse that decision again.'

He added: 'said: "Finsbury Park was entirely unsuitable compared with King's Cross but there was nothing else we could do.

"Any other decision would have caused even more discomfort for passengers."

Meanwhile at London's Paddington station, while the physical work was completed on time, safety validation work that should have taken two hours instead took ten.

In the week after the overruns, Mr Carne announced that he would not be taking his annual performance-related bonus for 2014-15. The bonus could have been as much as £135,000.

Asked about the bonus at today's hearing, Mr Carne said he was the person responsible overall for the Christmas engineering programme but added that he considered that bonuses were earned for a performance over a whole year.

He said: 'I know that the performances of the railway today are not meeting the public's expectations on a number of fronts. We are not delivering.'

Mr Carne was in Cornwall for Christmas and said he was informed of the King's Cross overrun at 2pm on Boxing Days and kept in touch by telephone from then on.
