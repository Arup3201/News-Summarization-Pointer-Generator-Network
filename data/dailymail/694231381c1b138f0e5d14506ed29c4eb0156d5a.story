Ray Rice's wife Janay has said she initially thought she was 'done' with the running back after he punched her in an elevator - but her 'heart' told her to stay with him.

She told Today's Matt Lauer that she was 'furious' with the former Baltimore Ravens player in the aftermath of the attack, however she knew her relationship would not be over because she believed it wasn't like him.

The pair will be interviewed together for the first time since Ray was indicted on aggravated assault charges in March. 

In a newly-released first person account with ESPN, she also described how she was annoyed with Rice because it was Valentines Day, and she wanted to go out as a couple - but ended up being with friends.

She also said that she was drunk when Rice 'slapped' her in the elevator and her memory of the events is foggy.

Janay defends her newlywed husband as an appeal to end his indefinite suspension in the NFL was granted by a U.S. District Judge. 

It means Rice is now eligible to sign with any NFL team - and can do so as soon as he receives an offer.

CCTV in the elevator of an Atlantic City Casino caught the player punching his then fiance Janay to the floor. 

'I was furious,' Janay told Lauer. 'We came home and we didn't talk the entire ride. 

'I just knew he hit me, and I was done. I just didn't even want to entertain it. Any explanation.'

Describing her reaction to the elevator incident, she said: 'Of course in the back of my mind and in my heart I knew that our relationship wouldn't be over because I know that this isn't us and it's not him,' 

Since then the pair have reconciled and got married a month after his arrest for aggravated assault. 

Earlier this month, Palmer - now Janay Rice - spoke to ESPN about the Atlantic City incident, saying it stemmed from an 'insignificant' argument between her and her husband.

She told the station's Jemele Hill: 'As we were arguing, he was on his phone and not looking at me. I went to reach for his phone, and when he grabbed it back, he spit at me and I slapped him.

Controversial: Rice, pictured with his wife arriving at appeal hearing earlier this month, has had the indefinite suspension from the NFL overturned and he is now eligible to play for any team 

'We got into the elevator and what happened inside is still foggy to me. The only thing I know - and I can't even say I "remember" because I only know from what Ray has told me - is that I slapped him again and then he hit me. I remember nothing else from inside the elevator.'

After coming round in the casino lobby, surrounded by police, Palmer was taken to the police station with her husband, who kept telling her 'It's going to be okay. We'll be okay'.

Explaining her decision for standing by Rice, she said although she was 'angry', she 'knew it wasn't him' and he had never acted like that before.

'No matter how long we have known each other and no matter what the circumstance is, Ray understands that violent behavior like this, even one time, is never acceptable,' she said. 

Shocking: Rice was suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey-based casino in February. CCTV captured the attack

Initially, Rice was suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey-based casino in February.

However, after security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract, and the NFL suspended him indefinitely.

The day after Rice was released from his contract, Janay took to her Instagram to describe the 'horrible nightmare' she found herself in. 

Newlyweds: The pair got married even after he was indicted on third degree aggravated assault charges 

Criticism over the two-day action led the NFL to toughen its penalties on domestic violence, with Mr Goodell admitting in a letter to team owners that he 'didn't get it right'. 

During the appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying former running back's two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice.

In addition to testimonies from both Rice and Palmer - who supported her husband - Judge Jones heard from NFL security chief Jeffrey Miller and Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome.

In her decision on Friday, Judge Jones wrote: 'Because Rice did not mislead the commissioner and because there were no new facts on which the commissioner could base his increased suspension, I find that the imposition of the indefinite suspension was arbitrary.

Consequences: After security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract

'I therefore vacate the second penalty imposed on Rice. The provisions of the first discipline - those regarding making continued use of counseling and other professional services, having no further involvement with law enforcement, and not committing any additional violations of league policies - still stand.' 

Rice is not the only NFL player to have sparked anger among fans due to alleged violence.

In September, Minnesota Vikings' star running back Adrian Peterson was arrested for disciplining his four-year-old son by striking him with a wooden switch.

Peterson pleaded no contest in a Texas courtroom to a misdemeanor assault charge following his arrest and was told to pay a $4,000 (£2,550) fine and undertake community service.

The NFL did not immediately comment on Rice's verdict.
