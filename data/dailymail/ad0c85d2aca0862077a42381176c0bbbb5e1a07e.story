It has travelled the world in a bid to capture images of every road.

However, Google's Street View car has, according to images unearthed on the site, also hit the odd snag - and animal. 

These images appear to show the firms' car in Chile, knocking down a dog as it drives - while the animal's companion watches from the side of the road.

As the car approaches, a dog can be seen playing in the road in the distance

The car draws closer - and the dog refuses to move, staying directly in its path.

Strays dogs are a huge problem in Chile, where the Google Street view images were taken.

An estimated 2.5 million dogs live in the streets of Chile.

According to a study conducted by the Veterinary Medicine Faculty of The University of Chile, in 2002 in Santiago alone there were over 1,100,000 dogs. 

Most of them (52%) were street dogs with owner, which means that this animals are allowed to roam public places and return home at will. 

Google's Street View mapping cars were recording Meza Bell 2815-2861 in the Quinta Normal, Región Metropolitana area of Chile.

As the car approaches the dog, it seems oblivious, continuing to carry on standing in the road.

Google told MailOnline it was currently investigated the images.

'We've taken security measures and have guidelines in place to protect people, and animals, as we drive thousands of kilometers to bring useful and relevant information to maps users around the world,' it said.

'We are reviewing the imagery to try to understand and maybe inform what happened.' 

As the car appears to impact the dog, the image is blurred - with no explanation of why

The dog is shown lying prone in the road - appearing to be dead or injured.

According to a study conducted by the Veterinary Medicine Faculty of The University of Chile, in 2002 in Santiago alone there were over 1,100,000 dogs. 

Most of them (52%) were street dogs with owner, which means that this animals are allowed to roam public places and return home at will.

The images are not the first time Google's Street View has captured unexpected events.

A recovering addict who looked up an area in New Jersey where he used to buy drugs and found what he believes is a drug deal in action.

However, in a later image, the dog appears to have moved - sowing it survived the impact, or may even have been simply rolling on the ground.

Reddit user wowurdumb found what appears to be a shady transaction when we checked on the Camden, New Jersey neighborhood where he used to buy heroin.

The Google Maps Street View shot shows two men conversing through a chain link fence and exchanging an unknown object for money, according to The New York Post.
