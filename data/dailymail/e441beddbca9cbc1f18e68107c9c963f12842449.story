England have been challenged to a football game by one of Brazil’s largest and fiercest native Amazonian people, the Kayapo.

In a letter on Friday to England manager Roy Hodgson, chief Raoni Metuktire and chief Megaron Txucarramae, have invited the squad to their rainforest territory 'after playing Brazil in the final'.

'We are all huge football fans and we challenge England to play against the Kayapó "national players",' wrote Chief Megaron.

'We live beside the Xingu River in the eastern part of the Amazonian rainforest. Our village is very traditional and we still live as our forefathers, so this would be a great opportunity for you to see how we live.'

The chiefs included a photograph of the some of the Kayapo ‘national players’ with their letter.
