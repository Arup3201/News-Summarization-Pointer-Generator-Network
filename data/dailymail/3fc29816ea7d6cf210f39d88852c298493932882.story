World Cup hero Guillermo Ochoa and the rest of Mexico's substitutes sat covered with blankets  on Tuesday night as Mexico's five-game unbeaten run was ended by Belarus.

The goalkeeper - who moved to Malaga in the summer - and the rest of the Mexico bench were wrapped up as Miguel Herrera's team lost 3-2 in Borisov having twice lead the Europeans. 

Mexico struggled in sub-zero conditions at the Borisov Arena and went down to an 81st-minute goal from Pavel Nyakhaychyk.

The first half had finished goalless before a rush of four strikes in eight minutes shortly after the break.

Raul Jimenez twice put Mexico in front but Belarus responded swiftly on both occasions.

Sergei Kislyak scored on the rebound after a penalty before debutant Nikolai Signevich headed in Belarus' second equaliser.

The defeat is Mexico's first since losing to Holland at the World Cup in Brazil during the summer.

Belarus, who sit 89 places below Mexico in the FIFA rankings in 106th place, had lost their previous three matches.
