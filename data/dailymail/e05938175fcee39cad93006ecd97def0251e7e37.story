Looking for the perfect little red dress for this February 14th? Amy Childs is here to help.

The former The Only Way Is Essex star has designed a capsule collection for Valentine's Day - and models it all herself, of course.

Amy, 23, has given FEMAIL a sneak peak of her new figure-hugging range as she tells us her inspiration behind the collection, how she dropped a dress size and why she’s hoping she'll be swept off her feet this year.

Amy Childs has unveiled a capsule fashion collection ahead of Valentine's Day - and every single piece is red

Speaking about the inspiration behind her all red collection of dresses that wouldn't look out of place on Victoria Beckham's catwalk, Amy said: ‘I love Valentine's. There aren’t many times a year you can really go for it and it's great for that. I think red is such a statement colour - it always makes me feel empowered.’

Amy has created her pieces, which cost around £50 each, to be worn on a date with someone special or on a night out with the girls. 'Every woman should look and feel fantastic,' she said.

'There aren’t many chances to go all out and Valentine's is the perfect time to take some risks with your fashion,' she said. 'All these pieces are designed to flatter with classic silhouettes that are guaranteed get you noticed for all the right reasons. I’m so excited to see the response.'

Amy also offered advice for loved-up ladies this year. She said: ’I think my top tip would be to make the effort for you not just for your partner. Nothing is sexier than confidence.'

The reality TV star and businesswoman, who is currently single, revealed: ‘I’m a romantic and would love to spend Valentines with someone special this year. Who knows what will happen - I still have four weeks to work on it!’.

Despite flying solo, she will be expecting a card from a certain man. ‘My dad always gets me a Valentines card and that’s all I need,' she said. 'It sounds mushy but Valentines is about all of those you love, not just your partner.'

Amy, who shows off a trimmer figure in the campaign images, reveals that she lost 3in from her waist, taking her down to a size 8. 

She explained: ‘I really believe in healthy eating and I train three times a week with a trainer working on strength and tone.

'I also did several treatments with a company called 3D Lipo, which allowed me to lose 3 inches off my waist. The best part is that it destroys the fat cells so all my problem areas vanished over the course of the programme and made me feel so much more confident. 

'I never want to be too skinny or muscular - I think curves are natural and I’m happy the way I am.’
