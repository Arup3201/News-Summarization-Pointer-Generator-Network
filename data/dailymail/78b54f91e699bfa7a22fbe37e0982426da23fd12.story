There was no better place than the Gabba for Steven Finn to show he really can overcome the problems that threatened to nip his England career in the bud.

It was here in Brisbane last year that Finn was sent home from an Ashes tour where he failed to make a single international appearance and was branded ‘unselectable’ by England after his action had virtually fallen apart.

The road back has been long and tough for a man who was once among the most promising and potent fast bowlers in the world — but this was the day when he took giant strides towards re-igniting his career.

Finn was outstanding as England brushed India aside with a nine-wicket victory on Tuesday. They took a significant step towards the tri-series final and, crucially, showed ahead of the World Cup that they can compete against one of the one-day powerhouses. This does not suddenly make England World Cup contenders but a thumping win over the defending champions, so emphatic it gained them a bonus point, was a welcome step forward for a team still with much to prove.

At the centre of it was Finn, who took his first five-wicket haul in one-day internationals, including the key scalps of Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. And to think he was so ineffective against Australia in Sydney and might well have missed out had illness not stopped Chris Jordan from playing.

Only two days ago Finn looked a disconsolate figure as he bowled in an empty net at practice, occasionally stopping for some pep talks with guest motivator Andrew Flintoff, while the other bowlers went through their paces.

Jordan’s misfortune was Finn’s gain but it would be wrong to suggest he is back to his very best. His old habit of smashing his right knee into the stumps in his delivery stride briefly resurfaced. 

Only two years ago in New Zealand he was being talked of as the first England bowler to break the 100mph mark, but here his bowling was almost 20mph below that.

Stephen Finn's figures of 5-33 are the second-best by an England bowler in an ODI in Australia. The best - Chris Woakes' 6-45 in 2011 - also came at the Gabba.

Yet he was accurate and hit the right lengths to prove almost unplayable for an Indian line-up who looked as though Australian conditions were completely alien to them — rather than a side who played a Test at the Gabba only last month.

Finn said: ‘There have been a few bad memories knocking around at places we have been to since we came back here but hopefully this will help to re-align me. I’m enjoying being in Australia this time. 

‘A lot’s happened in the last 12 months. It’s pretty much a year to the day since I went home from Australia. But that corner’s been turned and all that stuff’s in the past. I want to look forward and I think I’m getting there. I might have another couple of miles per hour in the tank but that should come with confidence. I hope to get into my stride as the tour goes on.’

He paid tribute to Flintoff, who clearly relished being involved again and could be seen with his two boys milling around the outfield seeking autographs after the game.

‘I have never really spoken to Freddie about cricket before and it was great to have him at the nets,’ said Finn. ‘To tap into his knowledge and get the perspective of someone outside the bubble was refreshing.’ 

Jimmy Anderson, back for his first international appearance since last summer, set the tone and emphasised how important he will be to England’s World Cup hopes with a probing spell of new-ball swing bowling.

Then Finn took over, taking three of the four Indian wickets to fall in 24 balls and adding two more in successive deliveries as England looked a potent force, possibly for the first time in the 50-over game since they lost the Champions Trophy final to India almost two years ago.

Finn finished with five for 33 and would have had a sixth wicket had Kumar Dharmasena detected a gloved catch from Stuart Binny while Anderson, easing his way back from a knee injury, was superb in taking four for 18.

England were superior in every department, Eoin Morgan’s excellent day in the field ending with an outstanding outfield catch that was then surpassed by an even better one from Moeen Ali. Once India had tumbled out for 153, England romped home with a stonking 135 balls and nine wickets in hand.

Ian Bell may have been out first ball in Sydney but here he was more like the man who scored 187 against a Prime Minister’s XI in Canberra last week. He benefited from a pop-gun attack to reach 88 in an unbeaten partnership of 131 with James Taylor.

India, it must be said, were awful, with Dhoni having one of his baffling days as captain, relying far too heavily on the innocuous medium-pace of Binny rather than throwing his fastest bowler Umesh Yadav at England.

India need to win their last two games to have any chance of reaching the final, while England travel to Hobart in good heart to play on Friday against an Australian side missing Mitchell Johnson, David Warner and George Bailey.

It is early days, but England can take considerable encouragement from this.
