For a cat with three legs, Benjie certainly has no trouble getting around.

So much so that his exasperated owners had to fit him with a GPS tracker after he went AWOL for a third time.

Steve and Claire Thorn use the £140 device in the six-year-old ginger and white Tom’s collar to follow his every move online.

Mischievous: Three-legged cat Benjie has been fitted with a GPS tracker after going AWOL for a third time

Benjie – who lost a back leg in an accident with a garage door – last vanished on November 22 from the couple’s home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.

He was found a few weeks later by staff from a local manufacturing firm, according to The Huddersfield Daily Examiner.

However, the couple say they are taking no more chances with the mischievous pet, who had gone missing twice before.

Mr Thorn, a 31-year-old analyst for a motor firm, said: ‘We’re going to be able to track his adventures from now on.'

As well as the hi-tech collar, the device includes a monitoring system, costing £60 for 12 months.

It also allows owners to plot a map of where their pet has been.

'Now we will be able to log into the website and we will know where he is at any given point in time,' Mr Thorn told the newspaper.

'The tracker is quite expensive but it is worth it for the peace of mind.'
