Robin van Persie’s wonder goal against Spain at the World Cup almost never happened – because the Manchester United star was hiding a secret groin injury which threatened to jeopardise his World Cup.

Van Persie will travel to Zurich on Monday to take part on FIFA’s grand gala which will decide the best goal of the year – which has van Persie’s diving header up against Spain competing with James’ volley for Colombia against Uruguay and Republic of Ireland’s Stephanie Roche’s stunning volley for Pearmount United to win the Puskas Award for the greatest goal of 2014.

But van Pesie has revealed for the first time that he was hiding a serious injury in the run up to the game which he feared could keep him out of the World Cup.

Van Persie said: ‘I boarded the plane to Rio de Janeiro with Van Gaal and the Dutch team and I was worried. To be honest, I was really, really worried. I had been sidelined for almost eight weeks at the end of the season, after being kicked from behind against Olympiakos in the Champions League. I spent all my days trying to recover, doing long hours of rehab.’’

‘The boss wanted me to prove my fitness in a full game. That was supposed to happen in our last warm up match against Wales. In more than three months I had never played more than 70 minutes.

‘But my left groin went stiff (during the first half against Wales). Not just a little, I was in agony. At half time I had to tell the boss the worst message: “I really want to play 90 minutes for you, but I simply can’t carry on.” It was a week before we had to play the World Champions.’

Van Persie says that he and van Gaal decided to keep the injury a secret from the Dutch squad, because they had so many inexperienced players and they didn’t wish to demoralise them.

Van Persie said: ‘Nobody expected us to do well anyway. We, the boss, the doctor and I, decided to keep it quiet. Nobody in the world was allowed to know. There was too much at stake, for the boss, for the team, for everyone. Sometimes you have to operate like that.

Van Persie declared himself fit two days before the game but says that the tensions in the build-up to the game explained his ecstatic reaction to the goal, which was also a crucial equaliser in the match that Holland eventually won 5-1, and his run to bench, where he famously exchanged a high-five with van Gaal.

He said: ‘When you know all this, when you realize all the drama that went off, the pressure on the boss, on the team, on me, people probably now understand why this was for so many reasons the greatest and most important goal of my life.

‘The stadium exploded, the bench exploded, but so did my head! I wanted the ball to go in from that flying header so desperately that I did something which I had never done before - I kept looking at the ball while I was flying, until I landed with a massive bang with my face forward on the ground.

‘The real reason why I wanted to run towards the dug out, was that my wife and kids were sitting right behind the bench on the first row. But before I got there Van Gaal came running out. It was marvellous. I wanted celebrate with everyone and with him too.

‘That goal, on the biggest stage of world football, was not just a dream coming true, it also changed the entire World Cup for us and the way the boss made his entrance at Man United. In a couple of weeks our whole world looked different that summer.’

Van Persie also revealed a softer side to van Gaal and how he managed to dispel apprehension in the young squad in the run-up to the Spain game. ‘There was so much tension in the squad. Their nerves had taken over. On the day of our first match against Spain the team was about to collapse because of mental pressure.

‘And that is when Van Gaal came up with his first master stroke. A few hours before the game he invited all the wives and the kids to the team hotel. I was playing pool with my son on the day of the game! And all the others were relaxing with their family too.’
