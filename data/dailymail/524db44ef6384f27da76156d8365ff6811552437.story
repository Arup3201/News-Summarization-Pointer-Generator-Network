An American photographer braved frigid conditions in order to capture these stunning photos of thousands of penguins huddled together on an island in the Antarctic.

Mike Johnson, 68, from Estero, Florida, joined several photographers on an expedition on board the Polar Pioneer voyage to the remote South Georgia Island.

The photographs from his trip capture the beautiful landscapes of the island and the incredible amount of adorable penguins huddled together.

'We were lucky, according to our guides, in that there are three large king penguin colonies on the island and we were able to land at each of them,' said Mr Johnson.

'To see tens of thousands of immature and adult penguins huddled together in a rookery was an incredible sight. 

'I had spent a couple of weeks in the Falklands on a previous trip and to see a rookery with a couple of thousand birds was impressive.

Mr Johnson says that guides told the group that they were lucky, since they were able to land at each of the three penguin colonies

'But this was over the top. It was more awesome to learn that we were early in the season and there would be more in a few weeks.'

South Georgia Island is administered by the United Kingdom as part of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.

Despite the wide range and vast numbers of birds and marine life, combined with beautiful scenery, the remote location and lack of access makes the island quite a rare destination for tourists.

Mr Johnson said: 'I remember the scale of the beauty. I remember putting my camera down at a few points and just taking the scenes in.'

'Not only do you have the opportunity to photograph wildlife that you cannot see in other places, the settings are spectacular.'

During his visit he managed to see several varieties of the bird including king penguins, rockhoppers, macaroni, chinstrap and gentoo penguins.

Mr Johnson has been travelling the world searching for wildlife and nature photography opportunities since he retired 10 years ago.

He said: 'The main motivation for my trip was to step onto Antarctica, which is the last continent I had yet to visit.

'It was a photography trip on a small expedition ship, the Polar Pioneer.

This particular photography trip to see penguins in their natural habitat was a small expedition on a small ship called the Polar Pioneer

'My experience is that smaller groups and smaller ships make for better photo opportunities.

'The ships can land in smaller bays and the group is small enough to enable 'people free' wildlife photos. 

'South Georgia turned out to be a highlight. Seals, penguins and other birds are both plentiful and, since they haven't been hunted in many years are very approachable. 

Mr Johnson says smaller groups and smaller ships make for better photo opportunities, as was the case on South Georgia Island

'Of course, with some animals, like the beach master Elephant Seals, you kept your distance.'

Mr Johnson's journey, which lasted 20 days and encompassed 3,436 nautical miles, also saw him visit the Falkland Islands and Elephant Island as well as the Antarctic Peninsula.

He has also had a few other wild adventures in 2014, having been photographing in grizzly bears and cubs in Alaska and jaguars in Brazil.
