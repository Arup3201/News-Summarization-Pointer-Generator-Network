Entitled: Simon Harwood (right), pictured leaving the hearing with his wife Helen, will keep his police pension despite being sacked for gross misconduct

Scotland Yard was accused of a ‘whitewash’ yesterday after the officer who attacked Ian Tomlinson was finally sacked.

Simon Harwood, 45, struck the innocent bystander during the G20 protests three years ago.

The newspaper seller, who staggered away before collapsing, died of massive internal bleeding.

An internal disciplinary panel yesterday dismissed Harwood, who admitted gross misconduct.

The panel said his actions ‘discredited the police service and undermined public confidence in it’.

However, it agreed to drop the key claim that his actions directly contributed to Mr Tomlinson’s death.

Although he has lost his job, Harwood - who had been suspended on full pay since 2009 - was acquitted of Mr Tomlinson’s manslaughter in July.

As he has not been convicted of a crime, he will still be able to collect his full police pension, estimated to be up to £15,000 a year.

Mr Tomlinson’s stepson Paul King dismissed the disciplinary hearing – the first the Met has held in public – as a ‘whitewash’.

Flanked by his brother and Mr Tomlinson’s widow Julia, he said: ‘I think it’s pointless, it hasn’t proved anything to us.

‘We still haven’t got any answer from this. After three-and-a-half years I think it’s diabolical. It’s like we’re back at day one.’

The Tomlinson family has already launched a civil suit at the High Court and has been offered damages by the Met. Their solicitor said all they want is an apology.

Disciplinary action: Pc Simon Harwood (left) has already been cleared of Ian Tomlinson's (right) manslaughter

Harwood’s dismissal brings to an end 
an extraordinary series of inquiries that followed the death of Mr 
Tomlinson, 47, in April 2009.

An amateur cameraman captured the 
moment Harwood, dressed in full riot gear, struck him on the leg with 
his baton and pushed him to the ground.

The father of nine, who had a history
of alcoholism, died from   internal bleeding after collapsing on the 
pavement minutes later.

Last May, an inquest jury ruled that 
Mr Tomlinson was unlawfully killed. Harwood, who had intitially been 
told he would not face trial, was then charged with manslaughter.

Details of Harwood’s disciplinary 
record, including how he ducked ten complaints by switching forces, were
kept from both juries because they were seen as ‘prejudicial’.

The allegations included a road-rage 
attack, racially abusing and punching a 14-year-old girl and a series of
heavy-handed arrests.

The officer, who lives in Carshalton,
Surrey, with his wife Helen and two sons, ‘retired’ from the Met on 
medical grounds on the eve of a disciplinary hearing, only to rejoin 
within days.

After transferring to Surrey, he returned to the Met in 2005.

Commander Julian Bennett, who led the
misconduct hearing, said: ‘[Harwood] has accepted it will be impossible
for him to ever again serve as a police officer.

'We agree, as we consider it inconceivable that he could ever hold a role within the police service again.’

Immediate dismissal was the toughest sanction available to the hearing, held amid tight security in West London.

Harwood’s barrister Patrick Gibbs QC 
dismissed the proceedings as a ‘show trial’ and said his client had 
offered to resign twice.

He labelled the direct allegation that
Harwood caused Tomlinson’s death as ‘gratuitous and provocative’, and 
successfully asked the panel to drop it.

But Jules Carey, who represents the 
Tomlinson family, said they had been ‘cheated of an opportunity’ to 
address the difference between the inquest and court verdicts.

Deputy assistant commissioner Maxine 
de Brunner said the panel’s decision ‘leaves no ambiguity as to how the 
Met views the actions of Simon Harwood’.

She stressed that he ‘does not reflect the professionalism of the majority of officers’.

Deborah Glass, of the Independent 
Police Complaints Commission, said: ‘This  situation may never have 
arisen had concerns about PC Harwood’s previous conduct been dealt with 
properly by his  superiors and those who re-employed him.

'This should never happen again.’
