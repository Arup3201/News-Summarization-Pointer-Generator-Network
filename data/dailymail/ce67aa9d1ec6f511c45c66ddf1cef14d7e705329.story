Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has shown an interest in signing Paris Saint-Germain star Edinson Cavani, according to French newspaper L'Equipe.

The 28-year-old, who joined the Ligue 1 side for a record-breaking £55million back in July 2013, is a summer transfer target for Simeone as he looks to bolster the La Liga side's ranks.

The Argentine recently spoke with the Uruguay forward, after being put in touch with Cavani through his international team-mate and Atletico defender Diego Godin.

Tuttosport are reporting that Juventus are considering offering Carlos Tevez a contract extension

Cavani, nicknamed 'El Metador', has often been criticised for his level of performance since joining the French giants - scoring 15 goals in all competitions so far this season - with his contract set to run out in the summer of 2018.

He would command a high transfer fee though, with it unknown whether the current La Liga champions would splash the cash to land the sought-after striker.

Manchester United have also been linked with a £60m move for Cavani, with Radamel Falcao flattering to deceive since joining on a season-long loan from Monaco.

Elsewhere, in Italian newspaper Tuttosport they headline with Juventus considering offering in-form striker Carlos Tevez a new contract, amid interest from former side Boca Juniors.

The 31-year-old started off his career with the Argentina outfit, and could be tempted for a move back to his homeland, after an impressive spell in Italy with Juventus.

In January he was quoted as saying he would honour the end of his contract at the Italian giants - which runs out in June 2016 - but was currently not interested in extending it.

So far this season Tevez has notched 21 goals in 31 appearances, as Juve sit pretty nine points clear at the top of the table - as they close in on a third successive Serie A crown.

In Corriere dello Sport they also focus primarily on Juventus, as Massimiliano Allegri's side look towards the Champions League and their last-16 second-leg tie against Atletico Madrid.

Cavani, Marco Verratti and Daniele Rugani have all been mooted as potential signings as Allegri's side look to increase the size and quality of their squad in the summer.

Finally, in Spanish newspaper Marca the focus is firmly on the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey.

Barcelona take a two-goal lead into the second leg of their clash against Villarreal, while both Espanyol and Athletic Bilbao head into the decisive leg on level terms.
