He is held up as one of the best examples of a perfect man, and one of the most recognisable sketches in the world.

But now the iconic Vitruvian man, drawn by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490, has been revealed as just being human after all.

Researchers believe an unusual lump above his groin reveals the model was suffering for a severe hernia - and it might even have killed him.

Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci: Experts say a bulge in the groin area reveals the model suffered a severe hernia - and it the model was a corpse, could have been the cause of  death

The drawing, which is in pen and ink on paper, depicts a male figure in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and simultaneously inscribed in a circle and square.

The drawing and text are sometimes called the Canon of Proportions or, less often, Proportions of Man.

It is kept in the Gabinetto dei disegni e stampe of the Gallerie dell'Accademia, in Venice, Italy, under reference 228.

Like most works on paper, it is displayed to the public only occasionally.

The drawing is based on the correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise De Architectura, which da Vinci obsessed over.

The image is a perfectly drawn circle on top of a square, with a naked man inside.

Many have taken the model, known as Vitruvian man, to be the 'perfect' man.

However, Hutan Ashrafian, a lecturer at Imperial College London, believes in fact the model was suffering from a major medical condition.

He believes a bulge slightly above the left side of the groin is an inguinal hernia.

Caused by the the protrusion of abdominal-cavity contents through the inguinal canal, they are found in 27% of men, and 3% of women.

'On studying the drawing, one can observe that the left inguinal region of Vitruvian Man demonstrates a spherical fullness above his groin that is consistent with ove and medial to the pubic tubercle,' he wrote in a letter to the journal Hernia.

'This corresponds to the classical manifestation of an inguinal hernia in Leonardo's depiction of the human form.'

Ashrafian says that doctors at the time would have been aware of the condition.

'Knowledge of inguinal hernias was present during the renaissance, with physician s and surgeons such as Antonio Benivieni describing several types of of hernia in Florence at the time,' he wrote.

'Vitruvian man may therefore have been modelled on a living or cadaveric individuial who had suffered from an asymptomatic left inguinal hernia, or who may have died from the complications of such hernias by means in incarceration of strangulation.'

The image is based on the correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise De Architectura, which da Vinci obsessed over.

In Book III of his treatise De Architectura, Vitruvius wrote:

'For if a man be placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centered at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom.

'And just as the human body yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from it.'

Leonardo believed humankind represented a microcosm of the universe, and believed this images showed that.

He wrote in a notebook entry dated to around 1492: 'By the ancients man has been called the world in miniature; and certainly this name is well bestowed, because, inasmuch as man is composed of earth, water, air and fire, his body resembles that of the earth.'

Other experts agree with Ashrafian, including Michael Rosen, director of the Comprehensive Hernia Center at University Hospitals Case Medical Center. 

'If it isn’t a hernia,' Rosen told Slate, 'then I really have no idea what it would be.'
