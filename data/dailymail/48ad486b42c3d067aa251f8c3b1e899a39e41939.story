The heirs to John D. Rockefeller's massive oil riches announced they will divest their $860million philanthropic trust from fossil fuels.

The Rockefeller Brothers Fund is part of a 50-group coalition that announced plans Monday to begin selling off assets tied to fossil fuels and invest in alternative energy. 

The move is timed to coincide with the United Nations climate summit set to begin Tuesday and marks another step in divestment's move from the campus grassroots to institutional investors.

Economics: Trustee Steven Rockefeller argues that divestment has a 'moral and economic dimension' since energy industry revenues could be affected by regulation

The New York Times reports that 180 groups have so far pledged to join the movement, ranging from charitable trusts and religious organizations to pension funds and universities.

Arabella Advisors, which consults with investors looking to leverage investments in social action, estimates that the pledges could encompass $50billion in capital, with an additional $1billion coming from private investors.

The movement asks members to pledge to clear their portfolios of fossil fuel companies, replacing them with investments in alternative energy.

It's inspired by divestment pledges used against apartheid South Africa in the 1980s.

Like the anti-apartheid divestment schemes, those divesting from fossil fuels are attempting to stir debate about the contribution fossil fuels make to climate change.

The Rockefeller Brothers Fund was established in 1940 by the five sons of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who inherited the massive fortune his father made in oil as founder of the Standard Oil company. 

The organization has already divested from tar sands and coal, according to president Stephen Heintz, but withdrawing from the wider range of fossil fuels like oil will take longer.

Grandson: Nelson A. Rockefeller served as vice president under Gerald Ford and later as governor defined a generation of liberal Republicans

“We see this as having both a moral and economic dimension,” said trustee Steven Rockefeller, a son of Nelson A. Rockefeller, vice president under Gerald Ford. 

Economic dimension because there is the risk to fossil fuel companies that governments will begin imposing tighter regulations on the energy industry to stem the tide of climate change.

This could leave oil and other fossil fuels 'stranded' in reserves, cutting into the industry's profits.

The Rockefeller Brothers Fund has directed a significant portion of its work towards environmental issues in the past.

It has previously tried to directly influence ExxonMobil through shareholder activism, though they admit that the company has not seemed to shift course.

The ExxonMobil Corporation is partly composed of subsidiaries that were formerly part of Standard Oil before it was divided over claims of a monopoly.
