A four-year-old Indian girl who was raped and dumped on a farm has died of her injuries two weeks after the attack.

The child’s parents found her unconscious in the town of Ghansour, Madhya Pradesh, on April 18, and has been fighting for life ever since.

Her condition deteriorated rapidly yesterday and staff at the Care Hospital in Nagpur, where she had been transferred on April 20, were unable to save her. 

The rape of a four-year-old in Madhya Pradesh is the latest in a string of sexual attacks which have sparked street protests

A spokesman confirmed that she had died from a cardiac arrest at 7.45pm on Monday night.

‘We were taking all measures’, P.A. Sriram told AFP.

‘But yesterday her condition got bad and her blood pressure went down.

‘She was not reacting to medications’.

A 35-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of raping her, reported Hurriyet Daily News.

Earlier this month a five-year-old girl was raped and tortured before being left 
for dead in New Delhi - one of two suspects appeared in court today 
accused of the heinous crime.

An 11-year-old girl is also being treated at the same hospital, having 
suffered serious internal injuries when she was gang-raped last August.

Today a driver of a school bus was arrested for allegedly drugging and raping a 15-year-old girl in Bikaner, reported India Today.

The teenager attended a private school in Bikaner and after she reported the alleged attack a man  identified as Rajesh Kumar, 35, was arrested,

'The girl was on her way to the school on April 26 when the driver met and offered her lift to the school. The driver was alone in the bus. He gave a sedative-laced drink to the girl and raped her,'  said CO Babu Lal.

Change:
Activists say passing new, strong laws is not enough, and that the 
government must ensure that police and the justice system crack down on 
crimes against women.

Publicity:
Rape has been a problem in India for many years, but the fatal gang 
rape of a woman on a New Delhi bus has pushed the issue to the top of 
the national agenda

Sexual assaults in India have been increasing for many years, but the fatal gang rape of a woman on a New Delhi bus has pushed the issue to the top of the national agenda.

The brutal attack sparked outrage about the treatment of women in the country and has made females more aware of the danger they face.

Sexual crimes against women and children are reported every day in Indian newspapers, and women often complain about feeling insecure when they leave their homes.

Since the bus gang-rape incident dozens of rapes cases in India - against both Indian women and tourists have been highlighted.

Clashes: Police have been criticised for using heavy handed tactics against demonstrators who are demanding better protection of women following the brutal bus gang rape

The attack forced India to confront the reality that sexually-assaulted women are often blamed for the crime, forcing them to keep quiet and discouraging them from reporting it to authorities for fear of exposing their families to ridicule.

Activists say passing new, strong laws is not enough, and that the government must ensure that police and the justice system crack down on crimes against women.

Women face daily harassment across India, ranging from catcalls on the streets, groping and touching in public transport, to rape.

Government data show the number of reported rape cases in the country rose by nearly 17 percent between 2007 and 2011.

Rape victims rarely press charges because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the attack.

Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack.
