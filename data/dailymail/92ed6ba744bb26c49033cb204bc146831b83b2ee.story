'Psycho banker' Rurik Jutting is understood to be detained at notorious Stanley Prison while he awaits trail accused of butchering two women in his Hong Kong apartment.

One of six maximum security jails in the territory, human rights groups consider Stanley among the toughest prisons in the world, with Jutting held alongside Triad gangsters, rapists and child killers.

Having asked to be remanded in prison rather than police custody during a court appearance earlier this week, the 1,714 capacity hellhole jail where Jutting is thought to be incarcerated is a world away from his previous life as high-flying banker, reportedly earning a salary of £350,000 a year.

Jutting is understood to have been transferred to Stanley Prison on Monday afternoon after a judge granted his request to be transferred there rather than continue to be held in police custody.

Martyn Richmond, a temporary lawyer assigned to him, complained that police refused to let him contact a lawyer of his choice or the British Consulate while in custody.

Mr Richmond said that if Jutting's requests were granted, he 'may well co-operate' with a police reconstruction at the crime scene, which is understood to be planned for Friday.

As Jutting has been charged with murder but is yet to face trial, he is unlikely to be held in the main body of the prison where convicted rapists and killers are detained and where gang-related violence is commonplace.

Housing both convicted and remand prisoners, Stanley Prison has a staff of more than 800 officers, wardens, medical professionals, canteen and maintenance staff.

Built in 1937, Stanley Prison became the oldest active prison in Hong Kong after the ancient Victoria Prison ceased operation in 2005.

It was originally designed to hold 1,500 prisoners but space has since been found for an extra 214.

During the Second World War Stanley Prison was used as a detention centre by Japanese forces after it was captured by the invading armies on Christmas Day, 1941.

From this period up until the early 1990s, the prison population is understood to have routinely topped 3,000 - twice the number it was built to house.

As a prisoner of war camp it became notorious as a place of torture and execution, with Mateen Ahmed Ansari - an Indian army captain - posthumously awarded the George Cross after being beaten, starved and eventually executed by Japanese troops who unsuccessfully demanded that he renounce his allegiance to the British army and sow seeds of discontent among his comrades.

Nearly 600 prisoners of war and civilians killed by the Japanese during the occupation are buried in the nearby Stanley War Cemetery.

Both of the young women found murdered in the apartment of British 'psycho baker' Rurik Jutting came from impoverished families in Indonesia and arrived in Hong Kong as domestic workers.

Like the hundreds of thousands of young Thai, Filipino and Indonesian women who flock there, both Sumarti Ningsih, and Seneng Mujiasih were mainly attracted by Hong Kong's higher wages.

Sumarti Ningsih married young and worked as a nanny in her town of Cilacap, but the couple struggled to find enough to eat, according to Time.

After giving birth to a son at the age of 18 in 2009, she is understood to have travelled to Hong Kong, ending her marriage and leaving her child in the care of her farmer parents.

She found work as a domestic worker and earned enough money to be able to send £150 back to her family every month - more than twice the total amount she was earning back home.

Miss Ningsih soon moved on to work as a waitress in a restaurant and took a DJ course to help boost her income. All the while she continued sending large sums of money back to her family to help them pay for her son's education.

However her frequent journeys between Hong Kong and her family home Indonesia had a negative impact. On her last visit to the territory she was only granted a tourist visa, forcing her to start working illegally.

Despite media reports to the contrary her family insist she never resorted to prostitution and continued to find cash-in-hand employment as a waitress until her murder last week.

Seneng Mujiasih's background was strikingly similar. 

She left her parents' home  of island of Sulawesi at some point in the mid-2000s but ran into difficulty when her then employer terminated her contract as a domestic worker in 2011.

Fearing that her dream of saving enough money to buy a house for her parents would lie in tatters if she returned to low wages in Indonesia, Miss Mujiasih also embraced the world of illegal work.

Living in a run-down boarding house just yards from Rurik Jutting's flashy apartment she, like so many other young foreign women in Hong Kong, began to seek cash in any way she could - including working as a part-time prostitute.

Although the death penalty was formally abolished in Hong Kong in 1993, Stanley Prison previously saw frequent executions. A total of 122 people were killed there between 1946 and the 1966.

While the death penalty is commonly used in China, Hong Kong continued to operate under a different set of laws after Britain handed the territory over to China in July 1997.

Inside the prison, all adult prisoners are legally required to work six days a week. Their roles are determined by the crimes they have committed, their physical fitness and the security risk they pose.

The quality of the work is then assessed and the prisoners rewarded with a payment system that allows them to buy rewards such as library books, television viewing time and newspapers.

Despite the brutal history of the prison, the Stanley peninsula on which it sits - known locally as Chek Chue - is one of the territory's most popular tourist locations, particularly around Stanley Market.

A picturesque home for many wealthy Western expats, Stanley is lined with expensive Victorian-era properties, many of which overlook St Stephen's Bay - considered among the best beaches in China.
