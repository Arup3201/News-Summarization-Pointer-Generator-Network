Market stall holders in Spain want to charge tourists they claim are hindering local buyers.

Valencia's Central Market, one of the oldest European markets still running, is popular with foreigners who visit on guided tours.

But food sellers say they are being overrun by the hordes of holidaymakers who often leave without buying anything after hogging up corridors to take photos.

Stall holders are now urging the council to try to find a solution - and say an entry fee for non-customers similar to the 50 cent (40 pence) charge for using the market toilets introduced earlier this year, could be an answer.

Market traders' association Francisco Dasi said: 'We know the market is a public building everyone can access but we also want the council to know we're receiving more and more complaints from our members and something has to be done.

'Tourist who arrive in large groups can cause problems for our regular customers.

'We believe asking the companies who bring these groups for a financial contribution could be looked at as an option.'

Marketeers fear that their custom is limited by hordes of tourists who leave without buying anthing

Nearly 400 small traders work at the market, which was opened in 1928.

Its spectacular architecture, including a 30-metre central dome, draws tourists from around the world.

One holidaymaker on TripAdvisor described it as a 'piece of art', saying: 'When we first saw this grand building, we thought it was a cathedral or a railway station.'
