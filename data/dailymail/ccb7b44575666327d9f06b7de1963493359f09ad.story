Newcastle United are looking for another striker despite the arrival of Facundo Ferreyra on loan from Shakhtar Donetsk.

Manager Alan Pardew remains keen to sign Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette but a deal for QPR's Loic Remy is unlikely.

Newcastle also want a centre-back and a younger goalkeeper. 

On the lookout: Newcastle have bagged the signing of Facundo Ferreyra but want more strikers

Pardew said: 'Facundo is a good presence on the pitch, a big guy at 6ft 2in, a player who has gone to the Ukraine and has been okay, if we manage to secure him, he would be a player who we'd expect to do a lot better here.'

On Remy, Pardew added: 'I think he’s had plenty of chances to come to us.

'We made it very clear that we would like to have him and it hasn’t really happened and therefore sometimes you have to say where’s the line drawn for us as a club as we have our own respect and our own professionalism.'

Ferreyra is due to join for an initial loan fee of £1.6m but the deal could be become permanent for £6.4m.

Newcastle moved ahead of interest from the likes of West Ham to thrash out a deal for the 23-year-old before setting off for their pre-season games against Malaga and Schalke in Germany. A permanent deal could follow which would cost Newcastle £6.4million.

Ferreyra scored six goals in just eight appearances but refused to play for Shakhtar because of the political unrest in Ukraine. 

He apologised for not playing and said: 'First and foremost, I want to apologise to them (the fans) and the president of our club. I hope what is happening in Donetsk will soon end. My family was very worried about me and persuaded not to go to Ukraine. 

'They thought it was very dangerous. So I decided not to go back. But on the second day I regretted it. My fears were dispelled by a conversation with the club CEO Sergei Palkin. He calmed me down and assured that all of us would be safe.'
