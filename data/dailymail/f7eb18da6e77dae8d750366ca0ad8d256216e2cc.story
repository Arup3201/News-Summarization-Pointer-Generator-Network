Dhanuson Dharmasena is on trial for FGM charges in the first case of its kind. Southwark Crown Court heard the alleged offence took place at the Whittington Hospital in north London

A British doctor performed female genital mutilation on a young mother after she gave birth in hospital, a court has heard.

Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, is standing trial accused of carrying out the illegal procedure at the Whittington Hospital in north London in the first prosecution of its kind in the UK.

A second man, Hasan Mohamed, 41, denies encouraging and abetting the offence.

The woman, 24 at the time, first underwent female genital mutilation (FGM) aged six in Somalia, London's Southwark Crown Court heard.

The highly dangerous procedure left her at risk of infection, haemorrhage and even death.

The woman, who cannot be identified, now lives in Britain and went to hospital  in labour in 2012.

During labour, her FGM stitches were torn. Dharmasena, the junior registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology, sewed her back up in a procedure that amounted to FGM, the court heard.

Kate Bex, prosecuting, told jurors: 'The prosecution is the result of an alleged offence under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003.

'Female genital mutilation is often abbreviated to FGM, it is also known as female circumcision. It may be that it is not a law that you have heard much about, or that you are unsure exactly what FGM means.

'You may be expecting to hear that the offence took place in a back-street clinic, by an unqualified and uncaring person, on a young child. This trial is quite different, but nonetheless involves FGM.'

She said the woman, now 27, had been subjected to FGM as a child in Africa.

And after the birth and 'at Mr Mohamed's insistence, or with his encouragement' Dharmasena 'stitched' her back up, the court was told.

Ms Bex added: 'It is that stitching back together by Dr Dharmasena, and Mr Mohamed's insistence or encouragement, which the prosecution says is an offence under the Act.

'What Dr Dharmasena did... was against the policy of his employer, the Whittington Hospital.

'That policy is written and available to all midwives, nurses, obstetricians and students at the Whittington and Dr Dharmasena was expected to be aware of it.'

Jurors heard that FGM is a highly dangerous procedure which risks the health of tens of millions of women worldwide.

Ms Bex said:'FGM can be very dangerous for a woman's health and psychological well-being.

'It can lead to severe health problems and, in some cases, to death. FGM causes gynaecological, urological and obstetric problems in women, chronic pain and sexual dysfunction.

The court heard the alleged offence happened after a woman gave birth at the hospital in  2012, where Dharmasena had been working for a month

'It increases the risk of death in childbirth to both mother and baby.'

Jurors heard the woman would have been most exposed to these side-effects when the surgery was first performed when she was six. Dharmasena's stitches would not have carried the same risks, but should not have been sewn at all 'unless medically necessary'.

Mohamed denies one count of aiding or abetting the procedure, and one count of intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence. 

Dharmasena, who took up his post at the Whittington a month before the events took place, was in charge of delivering the baby on the morning of November 24.

Dharmasena initially claimed he carried out the procedure according to the woman's wishes, the court heard

Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the deliberate removal of all or part of the external female genitalia.

The World Health Organisation describes FGM as any procedure that injures the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. 

It is also referred to as female circumcision or female cutting.

FGM is mostly carried out on young girls in adolescence but is also carried out on females during childhood. It sometimes take place when the female is a baby. 

In some cultures, it is seen as a right of passage into womanhood and a condition of marriage. Some believe the genitals will be unhealthy or unclean if the female does not have FGM.

There is also a common belief that women need to have FGM to have babies. But, infact, FGM can cause infertility and an increased risk of childbirth complications. 

The procedure is usually carried out by a woman with no medical training.

Anaesthetics and antiseptic treatments are not generally used and the practice is usually carried out using knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades.

The procedure can cause severe bleeding and infections, which last the female's entire lifetime.

It is estimated that 3 million girls are cut every year across the world. Around 23,000 of these are carried out in the UK. 

The practice is particularly rife in some African, Middle Eastern and Indonesian countries.

He said the woman 'was initially very reluctant' to allow him to perform incisions necessary for the birth, but was persuaded. 

A midwife, Aimma Ali, realised what was happening 'was illegal', jurors heard. She took Dharmasena to one side and told him.

As a result he told the on-call consultant Vibha Ruparelia and explained 'he did not know that he was not allowed to do it until the midwife had told him'.

The hospital trust launched an investigation into the incident within a few weeks.

In a statement, Dharmasena said he carried out the procedure because he thought the woman, AB, wanted him to.

He said: 'At no point in time did I intentionally or deliberately want to cause any harm to the patient. I had obeyed all of the patient's wishes.'

But jurors heard he changed his justification when he was interviewed by police on August 20 2013.

Ms Bex said: 'It would seem that Dr Dharmasena had familiarised himself with the law and you may feel that he changed tack as a result.'

She said that it was at this interview, ten months after the operation, he raised the possibility it was 'medically justified'.

Dharmasena, of Ilford, Essex, denies one count of female genital mutilation.

Linked to this, Mohamed is facing one count of abetting Dharmasena in committing the offence.

He faces an alternative count of encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence. He denies both counts.

Carrying out female genital mutilation carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. The case was adjourned until 2pm tomorrow.
