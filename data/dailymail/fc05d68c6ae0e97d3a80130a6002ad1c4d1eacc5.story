Shocked: Gary O'Donnell's children Dylan, 18, and Cayleigh, 21, want his medals kept in the family

The ex-wife and children of an Army bomb disposal expert killed in Afghanistan have accused his widow of cashing in on his bravery medals.

Toni O’Donnell, 44, said she had no choice but to sell the honours awarded to her late husband Gary so she could help provide for the children he left behind.

But the two children from his first marriage – and their mother, Karen O’Donnell – said yesterday they had known nothing of the sale and claimed that Toni was a ‘wealthy’ woman who enjoyed many holidays, had two houses, a BMW and even a hot tub.

Speaking as she and her brother Dylan raised money for Help For Heroes charity at the weekend, Cayleigh O’Donnell, 21, said she would ‘live on the streets’ before she would even think about selling the medals her father earned saving countless lives.

And she said that she ‘highly doubted’ her stepmother needed the money.

‘We were heartbroken to hear the news of the sale,’ she said.

‘The last thing I would ever think to do in my life would be to sell my dad’s medals. I want the medals in the family, I don’t want some stranger to have them.’

Warrant Officer O’Donnell, 40, became the first serviceman in nearly 30 years to be awarded the George Medal twice after saving countless lives in Iraq and Afghanistan.

But in September 2008, before the announcement of his second award was made, he was blown up when a booby-trapped device exploded as he tried to clear a path for his comrades.

Cayleigh said the medals were the only thing the family had left to remind them of their father’s bravery.

‘He worked so hard, he was so good at his job and all that is left now is his medals to show how amazing he was and they are going to be pawned off to the highest bidder,’ she said.

Selling up: Second wife Toni - she has two young children from her marriage to Warrant Officer O'Donnell

The family claimed Toni O’Donnell, who has two young children from her marriage to Warrant Officer O’Donnell, had bragged about her luxury lifestyle on Facebook, which included numerous holidays each year, and couldn’t possibly need the money so desperately.

‘She posted on Facebook how she needed another holiday to get over the holiday and couldn’t imagine the amount of miles she had flown,’ said Cayleigh. ‘They’ve gone to at least three or four places each year – to Lapland for Christmas, Spain and Greece.

‘I highly doubt she needed the money, the Army helped out so much. She had a BMW, a caravan, hot tub, a couple of houses – she got an extension put on the house she had with my dad. That is not someone in need of money.’

Karen O’Donnell, 50, said she had remained on amicable terms with her former husband after their seven-year marriage ended.

Warrant Officer O’Donnell married Toni in 1997 and they had two children – Aidan and Ben, who was just eight weeks old when his father died.

Karen said she learned of the medal sale by reading of it in the newspapers.

‘Both my children feel it is not her place to sell them,’ she said. ‘We don’t see any financial hardship.’

It is believed that Toni O’Donnell, of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, has since sold her BMW and the caravan and bought a cheaper car.

She said of the medals: ‘They are up for auction and I have my own reasons. End of. I have two young children to provide for. It’s nobody else’s business.’

The heroism of bomb disposal experts such as Warrant Officer O’Donnell was captured in the Oscar-winning film The Hurt Locker.

His first honour came in 2006 for ‘persistent courage’ in Iraq and the second award was made for two incidents in Afghanistan. The medals are expected to fetch £60,000.

Cayleigh, from South Lanarkshire, said the family was now desperately trying to raise the money to buy them.

Dylan, 18, said: ‘We would have cherished my dad’s medals because we know how proud he was when he got the first George Medal.

‘It was a huge achievement for anyone and if he was still alive I know he wouldn’t have sold it for the world – and neither would we.’
