A former star college footballer who was set to be interviewed for a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship claims Yale's sexual harassment policy has almost ruined his life.

Patrick Witt, who graduated in 2012, was due to lead his team against rivals Harvard in the final football game of the season - a match which could have seen him drafted for an NFL team. 

He was also announced as a Rhodes Scholar finalist, with the interview due to take place on the same day as his big game.

Mr Witt said he was also in line for a prestigious job at a firm as soon as he graduated. 

But it all came crashing down after his ex-girlfriend lodged an 'informal' sexual harassment complaint against him at Yale.

While the process was supposed to be confidential, details of the complaint leaked and Witt says he has been unable to clear his name due to the unspecified nature of the accusations.

Writing in the Boston Globe, Witt said that if the allegations had been lodged on a formal basis, it would have automatically triggered a fact-finding investigation.

He insists such a process would have allowed him to clear his name.

But because the complaint was informal, there was no fact-finding inquiry and he had no right of reply.

Witt said he was assured by Yale officials he had no need to clear his name as nothing about the informal procedure would be included in his official record.

But, just days after Witt was announced as a finalist for the prestigious Rhodes scholarship, he received a phone call from the Rhodes Trust about an anonymous tip-off concerning sexual misconduct. The interview never happened.

He also received a call from the firm that had offered him a permanent job upon graduation, telling him the offer was being withdrawn due to an anonymous tip-off.

When details of the complaint leaked, Witt says a good job offer was withdrawn, he missed out on NFL selection, and an interview for the Rhodes scholarship evaporated

 Later, as Witt was training for a possible NFL career, the New York Times ran an article citing anonymous sources saying that a 'confidential' complaint had been made against him. Witt claims this destroyed his chances of a possible pro-football career.

'The complaint lodged against me caused me and my family immense grief, and as a simple Google search of my name reveals, its malignant effects have not abated,' Witt wrote.

'It cost me my reputation and credibility, the opportunity to become a Rhodes scholar, the full-time job offer I had worked so hard to attain, and the opportunity to achieve my childhood dream of playing in the NFL.'

 He wrote: 'When I demanded that fact-finding be done (at Yale) so that I could clear my name, I was told, “There’s nothing to clear your name of.”

'The Committee reassured me, the informal complaint did not constitute a disciplinary proceeding and nothing would be attached to my official record at Yale.'

Witt is currently studying at Harvard Law School, and said he had to address the Yale complaint when being interviewed for a place at the prestigious college.

Witt said that he was innocent of the accusation, but due to the nature of the process he was not able to defend himself. He added it was only a matter of time before another student finds 'himself or herself' reliving his experience.
