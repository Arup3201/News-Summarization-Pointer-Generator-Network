A 13-year-old boy has returned to school nine months after being struck by lightning and suffering a devastating brain injury.

Ethan Kadish was left unable to walk or talk after the freak accident last June, but he is now making promising progress since returning to Loveland Middle School in Ohio three days a week.

In a wheelchair and with a nurse by 
his side, Ethan, who is still unable to speak, attends class in a special education room and gets regular 
visits from his siblings, friends and former teammates.

'It's been more amazing than we could 
have imagined,' his mother Alexia Kadish told ABC News. 'We initially 
thought any sort of schooling would be homebound initially.'

Back to school: Ethan Kadish has returned to Loveland Middle School (pictured with a staff member) 9 months after he was struck by lightning. He is still unable to speak but has started laughing again

In class: Ethan, pictured with Loveland School teacher Rachael Angel, is being taught alone 3 days a week

Support: Friends, including Ethan Missar and Cooper Smellar and  (pictured), visit him regularly at school and read to him, in the hopes that their familiar voices will help his brain heal

Ethan's improvements come nine months after he and two other children were struck by lightning as he instructed them how to play Frisbee at a Jewish summer camp near Indianapolis.

His heart temporarily stopped and he suffered a hypoxic brain injury after his brain was deprived of oxygenated blood.

The teenager spent five months in hospital and when he finally left last November, a life-threatening gastrointestinal perforation put him back in the hospital just 10 days later.

But following surgery, he returned home again in January and three weeks ago, carers suggested that he go back to school to see if the recognizable faces and rooms would help his brain heal.

'That's not much of a life for any of us,' Saunders told WCPO.

Ethan, who eats through a tube in 
his abdomen but breaths on his own, attends school for just a few hours a
 day, three days a week, and his friends and former baseball teammates 
visit to read to him.

Two friends, Cooper Smellar and Ethan 
Missar, said they are struggling to come to terms with what happened to 
their friend, who sometimes falls asleep while they read.

'It breaks my heart,' Cooper told ABC9.
 'It's hard to see him like this. We really have to get used to this 
too. It's going to be weird not having him on the team 
again.'

But Ethan's mother, who left her copy editing 
job to care for her son, said that since returning to school her son now sleeps better and he is now laughing.

'He laughs a lot,' she said. 'He
 even accesses the sad side... He's accessing the emotional areas of his
 brain. We're hopeful that it indicates that he's becoming more 
present.'

Chad Saunders, Ethan's daytime nurse, had encouraged the family to take him to 
school, aware that his days were largely confined to their home.

She said
 that the community has rallied around the family - cooking them three 
dinners a week and helping them raise money as they face steep medical 
bills.

Her husband, Scott Kadish, has returned to a normal work schedule 
at his group manager role at Procter & Gamble Co.

But even with insurance, the Kadish family have to pay up to $250,000 for Ethan's medical care every year, WCPO reported. An overnight nursing service will cost an additional $150,000 per year.

'No one plans for financial catastrophe to occur,' mrs Kadish said. 'You save for vacation or kids' college expense. You say, "For a rainy day" [but] this is a beyond for a rainy day.'
