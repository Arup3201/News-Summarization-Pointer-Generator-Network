A Catholic church has beensold to the Muslim community after a decline in worshippers.

St Peter’s has closed its doors to Christian worshippers following the recent sale.

Despite the sale, the church said that the local parish, Cobridge, in Stoke-on-Trent, would continue to exist and money from the sale will be used to benefit parishioners.

The identity of the buyers, who are part of the Muslim community, has not been disclosed.

A spokesman for the church said: 'The Archdiocese of Birmingham has over 200 parish churches and an estimated Catholic population of over 285,000.

'Any decisions taken about these churches is always done in consultation with priests, parishioners and the local community to serve the common good if all and to reflect the changing demographics and needs of the Catholic population.

'The parish of Cobridge has a long history. But in recent times the number of Catholics living in the area has shrunk to such an extent that those attending Mass at St Peter’s were simply no longer able to merit a priest and the church buildings.

'The church was put up for sale on the open market.

'A modest number of offers were received and a local Muslim community made the best offer, acceptable to the diocesan trustees after consultation in other local parishes.'

Churchgoers have declined in recent years, with the number of people attending Christian churches going from being measured on a weekly basis to a monthly basis.

A report on churchgoing in the UK published in April 2007 found that 15 per cent of the population go to church at least once a month.
