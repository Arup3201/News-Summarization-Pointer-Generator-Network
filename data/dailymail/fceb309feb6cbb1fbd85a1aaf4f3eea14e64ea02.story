Singer Justin Bieber was two hours late for his debut show at the O2 after 'throwing a massive tantrum', ranting at worried staff: 'It's my gig, I will go out when I want to' - it has been claimed.

According to backstage sources Justin, 19, was in a foul mood after waking up late because of a night out and the 'stroppy youngster locked himself in his dressing room to play computer games'.

Despite being accused of coming onstage two hours after he was billed to, with hundreds of upset teenagers leaving before getting the chance to see their idol, Justin said he was only 40 minutes late on Monday - blaming technical difficulties and saying the gig was 'great'.

One O2 worker, who did not want to be named, told The Sun: 'He was arguing with members of his management, his family. It was a really uncomfortable atmosphere. His attitude was, "I’m the star and I can do what I want"'.

Another worker, Ellie Grace, said: 'I hope I never have to experience so many upset children and disappointed fans again.'

Speaking to Heat magazine, an insider said the 19-year old refused to go onstage before showering, despite desperate pleas from his management to perform.

Another backstage source added: 'His 
lateness was because he didn’t get out of bed until late and sat in his 
dressing room playing games - even though his door was being knocked.'

'He then threw a strop as he said he wanted a shower first, despite already being late.'

It is thought Justin arrived at the O2 arena at 3pm 'to do some meet and greets' but he 
was suffering after a ' heavy night at his hotel.

But the great audience at the O2 weren't the only ones to be disappointed.

A
 15-year old fan - who did not want to be named for fear of backlash 
from the Belieber community - was 'blanked' by her musical hero even 
though she had won a competition to meet him before the show.

The unhappy girl told Heat that she and her friends, waited for three hours to see Justin.

However, when their idol finally arrived, they say he spent 'less than ten seconds' with him.

She also claims the singer declined to give her a hug, ironically telling his fan 'I don't have time.'

A source close to Justin said: 'There was no competition winner that we knew or approved of.'

'If it was a radio contest winner who got a meet and greet, they got the same amount of time as everyone else and exactly what was promised.'

The rest of the accounts are 'wildly exaggerated or just untrue.'

Even an O2 staff member witnessed 
Justin's alleged diva-like behaviour:

'He was arguing with members of 
his management, his family. It was a really uncomfortable atmosphere.

His attitude was, "I’m the star and I can do what I want".'

Despite
 a wealth of attendees confirming his two hour delay to stage, the 
Canadian star still maintains he only kept his fans waiting for 40 
minutes.

Still popular: Justin Bieber was presented with an official Wembley Way 
Stone this week after playing the stadium last year, causing his fans to record 
the loudest scream during the Capital FM Summertime Ball

'Last night i was scheduled after 3 opening acts to go on stage at 935 
not 830 but because of some technical issues i got on at 10:10..so...(sic)' the singer tweeted.

Digital Spy also reported that the star is being asked to pay a £300,000 fine to Greenwich Council for causing the gig to run past the 11pm closing time.

However, a Royal Borough of Greenwich spokesperson said: '[We] have not taken any action against the owners of The O2 in relation to Justin Bieber’s recent performance, as no breach of our licensing conditions took place.'

Poser: Justin visited Wembley Stadium on Monday to be honoured with his official Wembley Way Stone following his loudest scream recorded at a concert there last year

'I never have any intent to upset or let anyone down. and Im not okay 
with things being exaggerated. once again sorry for anyone upset.(sic)'

But to ensure the backlash didn't 
continue, the following night's performance saw Justin arrive on stage 
two minutes early, according to his official Twitter page.

However
 it seems the furore hasn't dampened the Girlfriend's singer's feelings 
towards the English capital, tweeting a simple message in the early 
hours of Wednesday: 'Lovin London. #goodtimes'.

And Bieber's popularity doesn't seem to be waning completely either.

The Baby hitmaker was presented with his very own Wembley Way Stone this week ahead of his London concerts.

Justin met up with The FA team and headed to Wembley on Monday, where he was inducted into the Wembley Way walk of fame after his performance at last summer’s Capital FM Summertime Ball.

Bieber will now be immortalised with a Wembley Way Stone having rocked the stadium last year causing his fans to raise the roof at the national stadium with the loudest scream recorded at the venue.

Justin said: 'Thank you to Wembley Stadium for presenting me with my official Wembley Way Stone!  Such an honour to be part of Wembley history, and thank you to my amazing UK Beliebers for helping me put on an incredible show last year!'

The pop sensation becomes the second Capital FM Summertime Ball act to be honoured on Wembley Way; he follows Coldplay who were also given a Wembley Stone having been voted as Wembley Stadiums Greatest Moment of the Year for 2012.
