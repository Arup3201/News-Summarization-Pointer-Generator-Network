McAuley has been credited with helping Gerrard's progression into a world class midfielder 

Former Liverpool duo Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen were also trained by McAuley 

Former Liverpool winger McAuley helped the likes of Gerrard and Robbie Fowler progress into England regulars during his time at the Reds' Centre of Excellence.

McAuley was handed an integral role at the club by Kenny Dalglish, who gave him the task of working with Liverpool academy's nine to 14-year-olds.

He made an instant impact at Anfield by guiding a Liverpool side, which included Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher, to their first FA Youth Cup in 1996.

Gerrard missed Liverpool's penalty shootout against Besiktas on Thursday night as the midfielder remains sidelined with a hamstring injury.

The 34-year-old is set to miss Liverpool's Barclays Premier League showdown with Manchester City on Sunday.
