Not satisfied with plain old paper, the artists entering this competition prefer to use the human body as their canvas.

The Irish Bodypainting Competition saw models covered top to toe in colour - and little else - at Temple Bar in Dublin.

The theme of the second annual competition was 'alien knowledge'.

The theme of the facepainting category was 'music of the mind'.

Held
on Saturday at the tourist hotspot, the competition was billed as a 
chance for professional body and face painters to show off their 
handiwork.

Among 
the impressive efforts on display were a woman painted 
purple and sporting a halo of planets around one side of her head, and 
another whose face had been transformed into a three dimensional piano 
keyboard.
