Millions of English holidaymakers could face passport checks at Berwick if Scotland votes for independence.

Families would be forced to undergo Calais-style identity checks as they returned to England by car on roads such as the A1, A68 and M74.

Rail passengers would also need to prove they had a right to enter the country before boarding a train destined for England, in a similar regime to Eurostar journeys from France.

Papers published by the Westminster government today show that, if checks are introduced, they could apply to tens of millions of journeys.

There are an estimated 23 million vehicle crossings per year in both directions between Scotland and England and seven million rail passenger journeys.

It would be a huge logistical exercise, with the land border between Scotland and the rest of the UK extending for 95 miles from Lamberton on the east coast to the Solway Firth in the west.

The border is crossed by 21 roads and two railway lines.

Officials are considering how Westminster will respond if the Scottish public vote Yes to ending the three centuries-old union on September 18.

They are concerned that, without the imposition of border checks, the country will become a ‘back door’ to England for migrants who would not otherwise gain entry.

The UK government has imposed a strict-points based system for workers from outside the EU, which makes it very hard for low-skilled migrants to gain entry.

But SNP leader Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, has promised to introduce a far more lenient policy which has lower requirements for qualifications and the sum of money a migrant needs for ‘maintenance’.

Officials are concerned these workers, having been granted a visa by Mr Salmond, would simply cross the border to England.

There are also concerns over whether Scotland would be forced to join the so-called Schengen area - which allows for entirely free movement within the borders of the EU.

Mr Salmond has insisted he would be able to negotiate an opt-out for Scotland in the event of independence

Currently the UK has an opt-out of the regime, which effectively means there are no checks on a person moving from one country to another inside the Union.

Mr Salmond has insisted he would be able to negotiate an opt-out for Scotland in the event of independence.

But Westminster officials say the rules drawn-up by Brussels clearly state that any country joining the EU as a new member would automatically be expected to join Schengen.

The immigration checks would cause massive disruption on both sides of the border.

They could also harm tourism, as many of the millions of visitors given permission to enter the UK each year visit both countries.

Scotland would also have to find money to fund its own borders regime - which currently costs Westminster around £2billion a year.

In a paper on immigration and citizenship published by the UK government today, the Scottish public are warned what they stand to lose.

The document says: ‘While the UK’s external border is proactively managed and protected, the movement of people and goods between Scotland and other parts of the UK is currently unhindered.

‘Travel around the UK does not require identification documents. There are neither customs inspections nor administration associated with the movement of goods.

‘The entire UK currently benefits from unhindered movement between Scotland and England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland’s borders with other parts of the UK are busy; both in terms of people and freight movement.

‘Travel and the movement of freight between Scotland and other parts of the UK are no more difficult than travel within Scotland.

‘There is no requirement to carry a passport and there are no customs inspections or other administrative requirements.‘ 

Officials at Westminster deny they are engaged in political games or scaremongering.

They insist that a country’s rules on borders and citizenship are vital for security and national identity.In particular, they highlight the major difference between Westminster’s stance on immigration and that of Mr Salmond.

The SNP’s White Paper on independence states: ‘We plan to lower the current financial maintenance thresholds and minimum salary levels for entry, to better align them with Scottish average wages and cost of living.’ 

The UK Government said ‘if a separate Scotland chose to pursue a significantly different immigration policy from the UK, then that could result in border controls between the two states.’
