Petra Kvitova made light work of Eugenie Bouchard on Saturday to win the Wimbledon 2014 women's title.

Kvitova won 6-3, 6-0 on Centre Court. Read the report here.

Host commentator

The fastest women's Wimbledon final in 31 years, at 55 minutes.

That's all from us today, unfortunately it wasn't the competitive final we'd hoped for. Back tomorrow for the men!

Bouchard receives a standing ovation, and says: 'I'd like to congratulate Petra she's played fantastic for two weeks.

'Really tough today but I'm proud with how I've played, I love coming here

'It's a step in the right direction, I don't know if I deserve all your love today but I really appreciate it.'

Genie's been Bouchard. Genie's bottled it. No way - Kvitova was just sensational. What a display of hitting from the left-hander.

I'm all for competitive finals, but sometimes you just have to applaud a player seizing the opportunity to perform at the very highest level. An extraordinary display.

Both players have left the court while the roof closes for the presentation ceremony. Where has that Kvitova been hiding since 2011. That was nearly two hours shorter than the Sharapova-Halep French Open final, brilliant from the victor, sobering for Princess Eugenie.

One of the best performances in Wimbledon history that, Petra Kvitova absolutely demolishes the helpless Eugenie Bouchard, winning 6-3, 6-0. You've got to hand it to her, that was superb.

Up next, the winner's ceremony...

The Czech star is on the brink here...

Inevitable. Bouchard was up 40-15 up there, but again Kvitova manages to win the game. A winner on the stretch just sums up Eugenie's day.

MIKE DICKSON: Frank Lampard having a long chat in the Royal Boks with venerable journalist Max Hastings - something of an odd couple. They are watching a fine display from Kvitova.

Bouchard forces Kvitova to deuce, but the Czech again lands her fastest serve at the tournament at 113mph when it matters most.

This really could be over soon. Another break for Kvitova, Bouchard just has no answer at the moment. She is pummeling her second serve, and the Czech doesn't look like being broken at the moment...

Another comfortable hold for Kvitova, she serves to love. Something drastic has got to happen for this match to change.

This final was always going to be about whether Kvitova, who is a wonderfully talented ball striker, would be able to let her talent flow and be free enough from nerves.

I think we have the answer – this has been extremely high quality from the Czech and Bouchard has no answer.

The Canadian likes to take the ball early and dictate but she has just not had the chance. So far the mental strength of Bouchard has not been allowed to be a factor.

Another break of serve for Kvitova, that's three in a row. She's dictating play, with some huge returns.

Bouchard's got a huge fight on her hands to get back in this one.

Genie breaks back! For the first time in the match the youngster manages to get on top in the rallies, taking full advantage.

This is incredible. Another break for Kvitova, who is playing the tennis of her life right now. Nine winners compared to Bouchard's four.

More huge serving from Kvitova. Bouchard just can't deal with that first serve at the moment, losing 82% of the time when it's in.

Crucial hold for Eugenie - she was down 15-40 but recovers well. Few unforced errors from Bouchard, but she is trailing on winners.

While Kvitova is serving so strongly, Bouchard just can't get into the points. Two aces already for the Czech, though Eugenie is trying to attack her second serve.

A superb winner on the defensive from Kvitova wins her the game - Bouchard could be in for a long afternoon.

Brilliant from the Czech. She is already striking the ball superbly, and three winners in that game is enough to take the early advantage. Can Genie fight back?

But Kvitova comes back with a comfortable hold herself, landing her fastest serve of the tournament so far in the process.

Vital early hold of serve for Bouchard, that should settle her nerves nicely. A typical powerful forehand beats Kvitova all ends up.

Kvitova looking for her second Wimbledon title, while the Canadian is searching for her first (surely of many) Grand Slam.

Both have got better and better throughout the tournament, so we're expecting a cracker.

Boost for the players! We're expecting them out on Centre Court shortly.

While Eugenie Bouchard and Petra Kvitova prepare in the locker room before stepping out onto Centre Court, the men's finalists Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic have already completed practice sessions ahead of their hotly-anticipated clash tomorrow.

Federer hit with former player Fabrice "The Magician" Santoro in front of a large crowd out on Court 4. Moments ago, I just walked past Federer round the back of the press centre and he could not look more relaxed as he casually strolled towards the broadcast area for pre-final interviews.

Laura Robson and Eugenie Bouchard were once so close that the Canadian stayed with Robson at her family home near the All England Club when they played there.

As teenagers they dined together every night during overseas tournaments and two years ago made a video featuring tennis stars - including Maria Sharapova - performing Gangnam Style dance moves.

But there has been an acrimonious falling out. Asked on Friday if they were still close, Bouchard responded bluntly: ‘No. I don’t think so,’ adding ‘I’m sure you guys can figure out that one... I’ll leave it at that.’

Princess Eugenie was expected at Wimbledon on Saturday to watch from the Royal Box as Eugenie Bouchard, the Canadian tennis player named after her, contested the women's singles final.

Other guests included the Duke of Kent, last year's women's champion Marion Bartoli, England footballer Frank Lampard, the actress Keira Knightley, Sports Minister Helen Grant, American golfer Jack Nicklaus and Britain's last women's singles winner at Wimbledon, Virginia Wade.

But we still have a fine day at Wimbledon coming up for you.

20-year-old Eugenie Bouchard has done so well to make it this far, but she has quite a task on her hands in the final.

Petra Kvitova is up next, with the match due to start (perhaps under the roof) at 2pm.
