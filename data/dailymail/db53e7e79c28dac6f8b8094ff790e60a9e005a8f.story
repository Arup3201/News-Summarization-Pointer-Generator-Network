A state official said Wednesday that he 'can guarantee' some West Virginians are breathing in traces of a carcinogen while showering after the chemical spill, but federal health guidelines say people need to breathe 'a lot of it' to be a problem.

The crude MCHM that spilled into the water supply ultimately can break down into formaldehyde, Environmental Quality Board official Scott Simonton told a state legislative panel Wednesday.

He added that the breakdown can happen in the shower and that formaldehyde is most toxic when inhaled

But University of Washington public health dean Dr. Howard Frumkin, an environmental health specialist, suggested that officials use caution when interpreting the results of the water tests, including asking whether the chemical's presence existed before the spill.

Concern: The vice chairman of the West Virginia Environmental Quality Board told members of the state legislature he多s a little 'freaked out' about what he多s found in the water supply following Freedom Industries chemical leak and resulting nine-county water emergency

I'm not drinking it: Scott Simonton, who is also an environmental scientist at Marshall University, told members of a joint legislature committee investigating the chemical leak that he多s found formaldehyde during testing of the water in downtown Charleston

'There's lot of possibilities there,' 
he said, including the chance that formaldehyde showing up in tests 
isn't a result of the chemical spill.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the chemical 'can make you feel sick if you breathe a lot of it.'

Simonton called respiratory cancer the biggest risk with breathing in the chemical.

'I
 can guarantee that citizens in this valley are, at least in some 
instances, breathing formaldehyde,' Simonton said. 'They're taking a hot
 shower. This stuff is breaking down into formaldehyde in the shower or 
in the water system, and they're inhaling it.'

Initial testing at Vandalia Grille in Charleston showed traces of the chemical in the water. Other testing showed no traces of formaldehyde, but samples are still being processed.

'The problem is, we're seeing it in water. We don't know what the concentration is in air.' Simonton told reporters Wednesday. 'We do know that there is enough mass of that contaminant to exceed EPA safe levels in air.'

Worries: Scott Simonton, who is also an environmental scientist at Marshall University, told members of a joint legislature committee investigating the chemical leak that he多s found formaldehyde during testing of the water in downtown Charleston

A resident of Charleston, West Virginia set a glass of tap water on fire to show the level of toxicity from a chemical contamination

A Charleston couple conducted a water experiment where they were able to set it on fire following its contamination with 4-methylcyclohexane methanol - which is used to clean coal

The testing is 
funded by a Charleston law firm, Thompson Barney LLC, which is also 
representing businesses that lost money because they couldn't use water 
for days.

Freedom Industries' spill in Charleston spurred a water-use ban for 300,000 West Virginians, but officials have lifted it.

State
 officials believe the leak of crude MCHM and stripped PPH started January 9th. Freedom Industries has estimated 10,000 gallons of chemicals leaked 
from its tank.

'We know that
 (crude MCHM) turns into other things, and these other things are bad,' 
Simonton told reporters Wednesday. 'And we haven't been looking for 
those other things. So we can't say the water is safe yet. We just 
absolutely cannot.'

According
 to the federal Centers for Disease, Control and Prevention, 
formaldehyde is a known carcinogen. It is colorless, strong-smelling gas
 used to make building materials and household products, including 
walls, cabinets, and furniture.

Erin Brockovich, who helped the illness-plagued town of Hinkley, California win $300,000,000 after a chemical company poisoned their drinking water announced she will lend her expertise in West Virginia

Breathing
 formaldehyde in large quantities can cause sore throats, coughing, 
itchy eyes and nosebleeds. Symptoms also are common with other upper 
respiratory illnesses, such as colds, the flu and seasonal allergies. 
People with short-term exposure are less likely to have symptoms.

According
 to the CDC, the risk of health problems is low when formaldehyde levels
 are of 10 parts per billion. The risk is 'medium' at 100 parts per 
billion, particularly among the elderly, young children and for those 
with health conditions such as asthma.

During the water ban, some people had put plastic bags 
around faucets so that they will be reminded not to use the water while 
others left town to take a shower and find an open restaurant.

Water
 distribution centers handed out bottled water and trucks with large 
tanks of water filled up containers for people to take home.

So far, only ten people exposed to 
the contaminated water were admitted to the hospital, and none were in 
serious condition, Health and Human Resources Secretary Karen Bowling 
said.

The chemical, even in 
its most concentrated form, isn't deadly. However, people were told they
 shouldn't even wash their clothes in affected water, as the compound 
can cause symptoms ranging from skin irritation and rashes to vomiting 
and diarrhea.

Other
 than schools, day-care centers, hotels and many restaurants were still 
closed on Monday, the region was open for business but foot traffic was
 slow.
