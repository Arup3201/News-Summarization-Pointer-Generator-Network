The mother of a month-old baby was 
murdered and dumped in a canal on Christmas Day as her family waited for
her to come home and open her presents.

Ruby Love’s body was spotted floating in the Grand Union Canal in Southall, West London, on Sunday morning.

Police believe the 23-year-old was 
thrown into the water just hours earlier, after being hit on the back of
the head and strangled.

Miss Love, who also had a 
two-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter, was last seen at 6pm on 
Christmas Eve before going out for the evening.

She had been expected to return home 
on Christmas Day to open presents with her children and her mother and 
sister, with whom she lived in Harrow, North London.

Her boyfriend Manzar Juma, 27, of Northolt, Ealing, west London, appeared at Brent Magistrates court today charged with her murder.

He was remanded in custody until his next appearance at the Old Bailey for a plea and case management and bail hearing on January 3.

Miss Love’s distraught mother Precious said: ‘She was just the most lovely girl, the best daughter I could have asked for.

‘We
were having our Christmas dinner and opening our presents as we were 
waiting for her. I waited and waited and I texted her through the night.

Sealed off: Investigators were still at the scene where Miss Love was found

Sad tribute: Ruby Love's home decorated by friends in Harrow, London

‘I waited until it 
had got to 24 hours after [she left] and then I gave it one more hour, 
and then there was a knock on the door. It was the police.

‘It’s such a loss – I do not know how we are going to cope.’

The
45-year-old identified her daughter’s body on Boxing Day. She said she 
appeared to have been hit on the back of  her head, and that the body 
bore strang- ulation marks.

An initial post-mortem examination was unable to establish a formal cause of death.

Yesterday Miss Love’s sister Sarah, 22, fought back tears as she described her devotion to her children.

‘She
loved her kids but she was a mother to everyone,’ she said. ‘She always
protected me and I could not protect her. She was an angel. We have 
just not stopped crying. I still cannot believe this.’

Grim discovery: Officers were called to the scene by a member of the public who had spotted the young woman's body

As a tribute, her mother has painted a white cross on Miss Love’s front door under the words: ‘Ruby’s Angel House.’ The Hindu-Sikh family had converted to Christianity and changed their surname from Malik. Miss Love worked in their property business.

Yesterday police divers were still searching the section of the canal where her body was found. The area forms part of the popular Hillingdon Trail walk.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘Police have launched a murder investigation following the discovery of a body in the Grand Union Canal.

‘Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed anything suspicious on, or before Christmas Day.’

He added that officers ‘are aware of previous incidents which will form part of our investigation’.

■ An Indian student ‘executed’ on Boxing Day may have been the victim of a racially-motivated attack, police said yesterday.

Anuj Bidve, 23, was shot in the side of the head as he walked with friends in Salford, Greater Manchester.

Five people – including a boy of 16 and two aged 17 – have been arrested by police on suspicion of murder.

Mr Bidve’s father Subhash, speaking from the family’s home in Pune, Maharashtra, said he learned of his son’s death via a message posted on Facebook.

■ A mother was stabbed to death after an apparent domestic dispute. A man believed to be the 36-year-old’s partner was yesterday fighting for his life in hospital after he was discovered unconscious at their flat.

Neighbours said the victim’s schoolboy son raised the alarm after stumbling out of the family property in Wolverhampton ‘covered in blood’.

Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
