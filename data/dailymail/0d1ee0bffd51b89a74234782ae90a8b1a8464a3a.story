It's a bank holiday tradition that motorists cannot avoid when they hit the road - even when it's a day early.

Travellers who are trying to make their getaways in advance of the big rush have been caught in traffic jams, despite their best efforts to make the most of the final holiday weekend before winter.

In Cambridge, motorists faced bumper-to-bumper delays on the A14 - a scene that played out on other motorways - and the situation is expected to get even worse tomorrow when the mass exodus gets into full swing.

Making an escape: Roads are expected to get even busier as more people go away for the weekend

While those staying at home are contending with busy roads and disrupted rail journeys, more than 
two million Britons will head overseas for the bank holiday weekend.

Hot
 spots for those leaving the country include Spain, Greece, Turkey and 
Tunisia while those heading further afield are choosing Florida and 
Cancun in Mexico.

Anyone 
getting the car out in the UK will have to compete for road space with 
an estimated nine million other vehicles.

The RAC said it expected Saturday and Sunday to be the busiest days on the roads, especially as there are major music festivals at Leeds and Reading in Berkshire - with roadworks in place on the M1, M5 and M25.

On the railways, engineering work includes major work at London Bridge station and at Watford in Hertfordshire. 

VisitEngland said 5.1 million Britons were planning an overnight holiday trip in the UK this weekend, with four million staying in England.

This was likely to generate some £1.2bn in tourism spending for the UK economy, £940m of which will be spent in England.

More than half a million passengers are expected to depart the UK from Heathrow airport over the weekend, as well as 234,000 from Gatwick, 172,000 from Manchester,  150,000 from Scotland's airports and 134,000 from Stansted.

In addition, hundreds of thousands will also be leaving the country from other regional airports, ports and the Channel Tunnel. 

Abta said domestic bookings had been boosted by the recent heatwave, although those holidaying in the UK will be getting cooler temperatures than during the long, hot spell as well as the possibility of some rain. 

Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said: 'This weekend is set to be one of the busiest of the year as we see lots of holidaymakers heading off for the bank holiday weekend.

'While a holiday budget will go further abroad this year thanks to a strong pound, we are also expecting lots of people to enjoy the long weekend at home.' 

But if you're staying in the UK, be prepared for plenty of travel disruption.

The Highways Agency said around 164 miles of roadworks on England's motorways and major A-roads would be completed before the weekend and 110 miles of works will be suspended between Friday and Tuesday.

But for safety reasons a number of roadworks will have to stay in place, including some on the M1, M5 and M25.

On the railways, a nine-day part-closure of London Bridge station begins on Saturday, with no First Capital Connect or Southern trains calling at the station until September 1. The changes will allow Network Rail to carry out a huge programme of work as part of the £6.5 billion Thameslink project. 

A spokesman for rail industry body the Rail Delivery Group said: 'Work goes on every day to deliver thousands of vital but smaller-scale improvements and over the next five years billions of pounds will be reinvested in the railway to meet rising demand for even better, faster and greener services.'

National Express said it had seen a surge in coach bookings for the bank holiday, with bank holiday Monday expected to be its busiest day.

It added that London was the most popular destination for coach travellers this weekend, followed by Birmingham and then Heathrow airport.

Tourism Minister Helen Grant said: 'The bank holiday weekend is set to be a bumper one for domestic tourism, generating over £1 billion in spend for the UK economy.

'From city breaks to days out on the coast, world-class music events to cultural trips, the UK has something for everyone to enjoy.'
