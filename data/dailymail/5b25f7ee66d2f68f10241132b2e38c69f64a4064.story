Olympic hero Mo Farah collapsed today at the end of the New York half marathon but said he didn't remember passing out.

The father-of-three, who won two golds at 2012 London Games, fell awkwardly around the six-mile mark but carried on and finished second.

At the finish line he temporarily lost consciousness in the chilly conditions and had to be helped into a wheelchair.

Medical staff rushed to help Mo Farah after he collapsed at the finish line after finishing in second place at the 2014 New York City Half Marathon in lower Manhattan

Interviewed afterwards, Farah said: 'I feel good.

'I don't remember passing out, but I think it was just I tried so hard in the race, obviously, taking a fall and then going through.

'I just tried so hard in the race. It's not a big deal.

'When I fell, I fell pretty hard. I told myself "don't rush" but when I saw the gap, the gap was big.

'Conditions here today were very cold. London won't be as cold as this.

'It would have been nice to win today, but he (Geoffrey Mutai) is a good athlete. Nothing changes for London - I will just keep training.'

Temperatures had been hovering just above freezing in Lower Manhattan when the race was held this morning.

Farah
 is due to return to Kenya on Tuesday for two more weeks of training 
under the tutelage of his coach, Alberto Salazar, before coming back to 
Britain ahead of his marathon debut.

Farah said his fall took a lot out of him.

'(The) last four miles, I was just pretty much seeing stars... everything was kind of blurred to me,' the 30-year-old said.

Asked if the fall was the difference between him winning and finishing second, Farah replied:'It's hard to say. I've not watched the race, but I know, when I went down, I went down quite hard. I did feel like my hip, got caught on my hip, my ankle, the whole right-hand side...

Mo Farah was strong enough to pass and hold off third-placed Stephen Sambu from Kenya in a sprint to finish behind winner Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya in 61mins 8secs

The 13.1-mile race was Farah's first competitive outing since the Great North Run last September

'When I went down, there was a massive
 gap, and it was hard to close that gap again,' Farah added. 'I tried my
 hardest and gave 110 percent. That's all you can do.'

The Somalian-born 30-year-old was strong enough to pass and hold off third-placed Stephen Sambu from Kenya in a sprint to finish behind winner Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya in 61mins 8secs.

Farah's time of 61mins 8secs was just outside his British record of 60m 59s.

The
 13.1-mile race was Farah's first competitive outing since the Great 
North Run last September, but comes just four weeks before the Briton 
makes his much-anticipated full debut in the London Marathon on April 
13.

Farah won the 5,000 and 10,000 metres at
 the London Olympics in 2012 and repeated the golden double at the World
 Championships in Moscow last year.

Farah had also won gold and silver at the previous World Championships in Daegu to add to numerous European titles, but still spends months away from his family to train in Kenya.

Before the race, Farah said he was due to have a brief reunion with his wife and three daughters in New York before flying back to Kenya on Tuesday to complete his preparations for next month's full marathon debut in London.

'It's really emotional,' Farah said of his reunion with wife Tania, step-daughter Rihanna and twins Aisha and Amani, who were born shortly after his Olympic triumph. My kids have grown so much in the last few months.

'In the back of my head I'm thinking 'They might not recognise you'. When you walk in the room and still recognise you and they come out and give you a hug, it's really emotional.

'It's what it takes to be a champion. I wish I could just sit in my house and do stuff with them, but I wouldn't have achieved what I have. My kids are lucky to have a nice place and we can buy them nice stuff. I guess it takes sacrifice to be a champion.'
