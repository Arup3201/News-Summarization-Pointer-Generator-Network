Hair brand GHD claim that their new Curve curling tong collection will give girls curls that stay up as long as they do. 

We like a challenge on FEMAIL almost as much as we like a party, and so Contributing Editor TONI JONES hopped on a plane to Berlin  to put the bold claim to the test. Here's how her hair fared...

Before and after: From sleepyhead to SJP as FEMAIL Contributing Editor Toni Jones prepares to put GHD's 24 hour curls claim to the test in Berlin

7am: Getting prepped  by celebrity hairdresser and GHD ambassador Kenna 

Toni says: 'I'm usually a wash and go kind of girl when it comes to doing my own hair but I never say no to a party. 24 hours in Berlin + my own personal hairdresser + the promise to keep the bar tab open as long as I could stay up = my dream day/night out.

'I decided to make the most of having a super stylist at my disposal first thing (Kenna's most recent Instagram post before our trip featured him and supermodel client Jourdan Dunne) and as well as having hair that stayed glam for 24 hours I demanded to look like Sarah Jessica Parker, who has been my hair idol since the Carrie Bradshaw days.

'These days,' Kenna, GHD's styling ambassador, told me, 'we call these kind of long, loose, lovely curls "LA waves".' Whatever, Kenna. I loved what he did with the wand and asked the London-born Brooklyn boy to move in with me about 30 minutes into my mini break makeover. A very good start to my good hair day.'

9am: Boutique hotel breakfast at Das Stue then off on our travels around the city 

'Berlin's first boutique hotel seemed a fitting place to prepare for our glamorous day trip. As I foraged around the breakfast buffet a small child actually waved at me, well, at 'the hair'. I felt a bit like Cheryl Cole (although Chezza probably wouldn't have wolfed two croissants and a cheese selection so early in the morning).'

7am: Getting prepped by celebrity hairdresser and GHD ambassador Kenna (and checking the day's hectic shooting schedule for the first bar break) 

* Add a root lift product to damp hair, blow dry with lots of volume using a paddle/round brush

*  Using a classic tong, twist sections of hair around the full length of the barrel (twisting makes the curls flatter rather than corkscrew cutesy) leaving the ends free to keep the look modern. nb random sections can look cool if you don't have much time

* After a few seconds of heating the hair remove from the barrel and gently pull. Don't brush or shake out.

* Spritz all over with a strong hairspray

How-to: Blow dry with lots of volume using a paddle/round brush and then using a classic tong, twist sections of hair around the full length of the barrel

Ta-da: Twisting the hair as you pull it around the barrel makes the curls flatter rather than corkscrew cute. Leave the ends free to keep the look modern

11am: Taking in some culture at the CFA (Contemporary Fine Arts Gallery) in Mitte 

'This is one of the city's favourite galleries and featured great space and light and very serious staff, basically everything you want from an art gallery. Current exhibitions include a 20th anniversary collection ('How Soon Was Now') and a show from Brooklyn-based artist Borden Capalino based on banal Craigslist pictures and featuring trash, pet food, and even maggots. The grubs made some hair curl. Mine stayed 'totes' LA.'

1pm - Experiencing secret Berlin at  Blub, an abandoned aqua complex in Neukölln 

'We got a glimpse into the secret side of Berlin with a trip to an abandoned swimming pool complex hidden from sight and slowly falling into beautiful decay. Originally the aqua centre featured pools, slides, waterfalls, saunas, Turkish baths... but now it's mostly used as a skate park/hangout by Berlin's cool kids. Spooky. Fabulous. A must-see and a total health hazard… and I was entirely over-styled and overdressed for the occasion but it made a great backdrop for some hot hair pictures.'

3pm - Lunch at Parker Bowles in Moritzplatz 

This was my first chance to swish the hair at hot Berliners as we late lunched at the very hip Parker Bowles, named - of course - after our beloved Camilla. I'm sure the Duchess of Cornwall would have approved of the pulled pork burgers served with piles of pickle jalapeños, the homemade lemonade cocktails and definitely the handsome baristas.

3pm - Lunch at Parker Bowles in Moritzplatz

5pm - A history lesson at the East Side Gallery in Friedrichshain-Kreuzber 

After lunch it was time to learn a bit about the city as the curls battled with blustery conditions next to the river Spree. The East Side gallery is a memorial built on a section of the Berlin Wall and it's the largest open air gallery in the world featuring bright, bold murals remembering the city's history and celebrating its future.

7pm - Back at Das Stue getting ready to hit the town 

Back at the hotel it was time to ramp up the eyeliner and start breathing in as I donned a bodycon dress. No need to 're-zhujh' the hair though, I just threw my head upside down, gave it a quick ruffle and walked out the door. MASSIVE result and serious time saving points for those of us who like to get to the bar as early as possible.

7pm - Back at Das Stue getting ready to hit the town

9pm - Drinks at the Monkey Bar at the 25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin 

The Monkey Bar got it's name because drinkers have a direct view into the monkey enclosures in the Berlin Zoo below. There was a lot of interesting wildlife around the rum-themed bar too, which was packed even on a Tuesday night and a perfect place to put 'the hair' - dropping slightly but still still going over 12 hours in - to the test with a quick smirt on the balcony outside.

11pm - Paleo dinner at Sauvage Berlin in Neuköll 

Berliners don't really do diets... but they won't argue with an eating plan that guarantees more energy to stay out partying. Paleo - aka eating like a caveman - is hot right now in this city and Sauvage is the leader of the pack. It helps that Boris the owner resembles a male model (that no sugar, no dairy, no processed regime obviously works). We feasted on steak tartare, monkfish, and dairy-free fondant and drank too many of the brilliantly named Homo-Eruptus cocktails, with 'the hair' scoring a second round on the house.

Sauvage’s menu emerged from boss Boris Leite-Poco's personal experience of transforming his body through the Paleo diet.  

According to fans of this way of eating, adjusting your eating habits to Paleo principles means feeding your body as nature intended, resulting in noticeable health benefits because the unprocessed and/or raw ingredients used have high nutritional value. 

Chef, author and restaurateur Boris Leite-Poco is spearheading the trend for Paleo eating in Berlin

THE PALEO BROWNIE (Flourless Chocolate and Beetroot Brownie) 

Combine the beets and honey in a sauce pan, and cook on medium-low heat for 10 minutes, or until beets are soft.

in the mean time, combine in a bowl the eggs, fats, vanilla, cardamom and cocoa and whisk well.

Preheat the oven to 135°C.

Remove beets from heat, transfer to a food processor, or blend using a hand blender until completely pureed.

Combine both mixtures, add walnuts and a pinch of salt.

Lay the mixture on a greased square oven dish (or lined with baking paper) and bake for 30 minutes or until firm. 

1am - Cool cocktails at Geist Im Glas in Neukölln 

A trip to Berlin isn't complete without stumbling across a secret bar. And this smoky speakeasy was the perfect place to deconstruct our day and plan the rest of our night. The back shelves here were filled with dangerous-looking bottles of home-flavoured spirts and there was no main cocktail menu, instead the (only slightly intimidating) bar staff created bespoke cocktails based on what we felt like drinking and doing (my tipple was an incredible tequila, rosemary and coffee concoction which acted as the perfect pick-me-up).

3am (and onwards) - Dancing at Chalet in Kreuzberg

Kreuzberg is the place to be after the clock strikes 12 any day of the week in Berlin. There's a cheap bar, outside space, secret rooms and a great DJ line-up (even on a Tuesday). This was the final push for the curls, could they last spinning around a smoky, sweaty dance floor? They did. Longer than I could in fact as I headed home around 6am with them still bobbing behind me. It's probably for the best that no pictures were allowed.

7am - Time to call it a night back at Das Stue

After watching the sunrise from our pretty balcony it was time for bed. My hair certainly SMELLED like it had been out for 24 hours (and the rest) after partying with the city's smokers BUT it managed to look quite a bit fresher than I felt.

 

7am - Time to call it a night back at Das Stue

VERDICT: Sold.The magic wand lived up to its 24 hour claim.

Yes, it helps having a hair superstar styling your 'do to begin with, but Kenna didn't do anything groundbreaking to my barnet, he just prepped it really well using more product than I usually would, blow-dried it properly (which I never bother to do) and then spent time working patiently through all sections of the hair. 

It didn't take as long as it looks like it should have. It DID include a lot of hairspray. and it DID put a bounce in my step all day and night.

Having taken some tips from the hair guru and learned not to spend my evenings scraping my hair up and down according to temperature issues I will be taking my GHD curls out on the town again as soon as my liver allows.
