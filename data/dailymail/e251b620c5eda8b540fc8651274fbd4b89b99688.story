When they are not strutting down the catwalk or on photoshoots in exotic locations, what do models do in their spare time?

If you believe the gossip columns, you might imagine the majority live it up at parties and on luxury yachts.

But male model Gerard Smith proves there are exceptions. When he has his downtime, he likes nothing better than donning his overalls and indulging in his passion for DIY.

Rock star crib: Gerard and Mei-an in their kitchen which boasts tiles from a London Underground station, cabinets made from Spitfires and a table which once belonged to Mick Jagger

Gerard, 39 – who has worked with Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Bono in a 20-year career that has seen him modelling for Calvin Klein and Gucci – has applied these handyman skills and a talent for spotting classic furniture to turn his bijou  flat in Clapham, South London, into a retro palace.

The fact that he and his partner, Mei-an Collier, 32, an art director at clothes store White Stuff, both trained at art college and obviously have aesthetic sensibilities helped transform the property.

When they bought it in 2010, it was a ‘mouse-infested dump’, but the couple recognised the ex-council home’s potential.

It is on the third floor of Grant House, a 1930s estate built to provide accommodation for auxiliary staff such as cleaners and engineers working at the Houses of Parliament. It was later acquired by the London Borough of Lambeth to provide council housing. Now about 40 per cent of the properties are privately owned.

The flats surround a large well-tended communal garden, have off-street private parking for only £30 a year, and included in a modest service charge of £1,200 is a permanent supply of hot water.

Gerard and Mei-an’s flat has two bedrooms and is split over two floors. It has the advantage of a large balcony space.

The couple paid £210,000 for it and have now put it on the market for £335,000 as they plan to move out of inner London to buy a bigger property to raise a family.

Gerard spent about £60,000 on the flat – meaning the couple will make a £65,000 profit – but this pales into insignificance when you consider  the imagination, not to mention the hard graft, he has put in.

His most eye-catching addition is the former London Underground station tiling in the kitchen/diner and bathroom. The blue tiles in the kitchen once adorned the walls at Edgware Road station, while the white ones are from Northern line stations.

But the work probably most far removed from his day job was laying the teak flooring, which he acquired on eBay. ‘It’s laid on tar so it was a very messy job,’ he recalls.

Other retro items also found on eBay are a 1960s G-Plan wooden cabinet in the sitting room, glass bricks, a cast-iron bathtub, a Smeg fridge, chunky cast-iron radiators and a kitchen table ‘that once belonged to Mick Jagger’.

‘I bought it from an old manager  of the Stones. I had to go to Somerset to pick it up. In fact possibly the hardest work involved was getting the stuff – I had to go all over the country,’ says Gerard.

Perhaps the most interesting additions, however, are the kitchen cabinets, which have been crafted out of the fuselages of Second World War Spitfires.

‘They come from a firm called English Rose, but I bought them on eBay. At the end of the war, English Rose bought up a whole lot of planes no longer in use and turned them into cabinets. They come as units and fit together like Meccano.’

Gerard has generously decided to leave his eBay acquisitions for the new owners.

The couple will miss living in such a central location when they move – the flat is a short walk from Clapham Common and Clapham Old Town, while to the north, the Nine Elms  area is in the process of regeneration thanks to the imminent arrival of the US Embassy.

With his modelling career not as busy as it once was, Gerard sees his future in property development.

Tom Crabtree, of Marsh & Parsons, Clapham, said: ‘The property has been converted to become an amazing space.

‘This reflects Clapham, which has become one of the most interesting and vibrant of places to live south of the river.’
