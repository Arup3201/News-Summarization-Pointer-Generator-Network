With a wardrobe packed with high-end garments and the most acclaimed designers on speed dial, it's surprising that Gwyneth Paltrow still manages to put a stylish foot wrong.

The 42-year-old actress suffered another fashion faux pas as she appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday evening.

The mother-of-two failed to impress - and became the target of style critics - when she stepped out in an unflattering nude pantsuit with ruffle details by Elie Saab.

Gwyneth Paltrow suffered a rare fashion faux pas in Elie Saab as she appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday evening

On the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Gwyneth stepped out to greet the crowd with a huge grin...but it was a shame that Elie Saab jumpsuit wasn't a huge success.

Fashion Finder wasn't convinced on the piece. It seemed to cling in all the wrong places and the style did the star no favours.

But that doesn't mean that blush jumpsuits are out of the question. Because while Gwyneth may have made a fashion faux-pas with her ill-fitting piece, you don't have to.

We have been scouting around for some alternatives and we think we've come up trumps. If you've got a big budget, then the Valentino piece gets the thumbs up and what's more, is that it's got almost 75% off - so get shopping ladies if you want a designer bargain.

But Boohoo and Missguided have great cheap and cheerful options available, so don't feel priced out - there's something for everyone.

Featuring loose-fitting wide legs that swamped her lithe limbs, the  jumpsuit certainly wasn't one of the Oscar-winning star's best outfit choices.

Gwyneth teamed her nude number with a pair of towering black strappy sandals, and wore her blonde locks poker straight around her shoulders.

The Pre-Fall 2015 piece, which isn't even available until the summer, seemed to cling in all the wrong places and the style did the star no favours.

Gwyneth's exact garment won't hit stores until July but the Lebanese fashion designer has similar offerings on sale for well in excess of £1,000.

The actress made the bizarre decision to slip her svelte physique into an odd nude pantsuit with ruffle detail

A similar style, the stretch crepe jumpsuit, retails for £1,775 in Selfridges.

Describing the piece, the site says: 'Epitomising the west-east culture fusion of designer Elie Saab this stretch-crepe jumpsuit is bound to become an essential for glamorous evening occasions. 

'Pretty knot detailing and a chic silk panel embellish the front while a fitted waistband makes it a flattering choice for the most sophisticated of females.'

Speaking about Gwyneth's fashion fail, style blogger Lydia Rhodes, said: 'I was so disappointed to see Gwyneth in this unflattering ensemble.

'Elie is the king of fairy tale creations but this jumpsuit failed to hit the mark. Elie, who has dressed everyone from the Royal family to Beyonce, usually serves up the loveliest of gowns in the most delicious colour palettes. 

'Perhaps Gwyneth needed to opt for a size bigger to avoid the dreaded camel toe and cling.'

The Twittersphere was equally unimpressed. One user said: 'Gwyneth looks like a naked mole rat in this jumpsuit', while another added: 'If what she wore on Fallon last night was any indication, we're in for an epic Gwyneth Paltrow meltdown in 2015.'

One fashion critic questioned if Miss Paltrow's outfit was the most 'ill-fitting' look of the year

Writer Bethany Ramos even wrote an open letter addressed to the jumpsuit in question. Writing on SheKnows.com, she proclaimed: 'The moment I laid eyes on you, I knew I would never be the same. Seeing you in all of your nude, ruffly pantsuit glory as you hugged Gwyneth Paltrow's svelte figure on The Tonight Show... well, let's just say the camel toe has never looked so good.

'How does that saying go? "Celebrities, they're just like us." Gwyneth Paltrow's pantsuit, you have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the elite, upper-crust and often unfairly hated Gwyneth is just a woman of the people.

'Maybe Gwyneth had a temporary bout of insanity when she agreed to wear you, or maybe she's smarter than all of us realize. Everyone's talking about you. Everyone can't stop thinking about you. Just give it a few weeks, and everyone will be wearing nude, ruffly, camel toe jumpsuits without a hint of irony.'

Just because Gwyneth got it wrong doesn't mean that blush jumpsuits are out of the question. Lucy Mecklenburgh, Ellen Pompeo and Binky Felstead prove the piece can work and e-tailers Asos, Topshop and Missguided have plenty of stock starting to drop ahead of the warmer months. 

Simon Glazin (theverysimong.com) added: 'Good old Gwynie, she's got to make headlines somehow, and recently it's been all about her fashion choices and "conscious uncoupling" rather than movie roles.

'I actually love seeing her in a jumpsuit, she has the right figure for one, and I do really like this one. It's interesting.

'However, in some lights, the colour washes her out to make it look like a green-screen body suit. And Gwynie love, we don't need camel toe from you!'.
