Italy’s former prime minister  Silvio Berlusconi was sentenced to seven years in jail for sex and corruption offences yesterday – but doubts were immediately raised about whether he will ever spend a day behind bars.

A court in Milan ruled the billionaire politician, 76, had sex with underage prostitute ‘Ruby the Heartstealer’ at his bunga bunga parties while in office and used his power to cover it up.

In a now infamous phone call, the ex-premier freed the former exotic dancer – real name Karima El Mahroug – from police custody by claiming she was the niece of deposed Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.

But despite the verdict, which 
Berlusconi was not in court to hear, experts said he might never spend 
any time behind bars  because of his age and Italy’s lengthy appeals 
process.

The  ruling is not final until he has
 exhausted two levels of appeal, and even then he may not see the inside
 of a cell because of the country’s lenient laws for  sentencing 
over-70s.

Berlusconi has been brought to trial 
some 30 times, although very rarely convicted. Last month an appeals 
court upheld a sentence against him for tax fraud, leaving him one more 
appeal at the end of this year.

Questioned: Karima El Mahrough appeared in court in a previous trial in Milan. But Berlusconi's team eventually dropped her from the witness list after she failed to show on a couple of occasions in the current trial

Appeals: Silvio Berlusconi can appeal against the decision of the Milan Court, pictured,  before it becomes final - meaning he will not serve any time in prison if his appeals are successful 

If that verdict also goes against 
him, the original sentence of four years in jail and a five-year bar 
from holding public office would take effect, essentially ending his 
political career.

The latest ruling followed a two-year
 trial in which the court heard titillating details of a ‘ring of 
prostitution’ centred at Berlusconi’s mansion outside Milan.

At the time of the bunga bunga parties, in 2010, Ruby was 17, a year under the legal age for prostitution in Italy.

Berlusconi always claimed the soirees were ‘elegant dinners’ with an atmosphere of ‘good cheer’.

But this version of events contrasted
 wildly with that of the prosecutors, who said Ruby was ‘part of a 
prostitution system set up for the personal sexual satisfaction of the 
defendant’.
