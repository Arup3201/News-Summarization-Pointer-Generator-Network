Victim: Nijole Siskeviciene was strangled in October 1998 near her home in Wembley, north London. James Kennedy, 54, denies murder

A convicted rapist strangled a woman to death but was not arrested for 12 years after sending police anonymous letters blaming two black men for the crime, a court heard.

James Kennedy, 54, was charged with murder after he was stopped for drink-driving in July 2010 andÂ  police took a DNA sample from him.

It matched saliva found on Nijole Siskeviciene, 44, whose body was discovered beside a garage in Wembley, north London, in October 1998, the Old Bailey was told yesterday.

She had been sexually assaulted and strangled with a ligature, prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC said.

Kennedy lived two doors away from the mother-of-one at the time and denied knowing her when interviewed by police in house-to-house inquiries.

A week after the murder police received two anonymous letters from someone claiming to have seen two black men carrying out a girl from a house.

When he was arrested at his home in Weston-Super-Mare in January this year, Kennedy - who now walks with a stick - said 'Oh my God' and was 'visibly shaken', the court heard.

His DNA was found to match that on the letters and police found the same stationery in his home during a search, the hearing was told.

Mr Bennetts said Nijole 'had marks to her body consistent
with having been held by her attacker about the throat and wrists and 
injuries were consistent with a hand being placed over her mouth. Her underwear was inside out.

'Together with evidence of DNA upon her body and clothing, that evidence 
is clear, say the prosecution, and consistent with there having been 
sexual activity prior to, or at the time of her death.'

The court heard that Kennedy was previously jailed for raping two women in his home town in Ireland in 1978.

Then aged 21, he offered a 19-year-old a lift in his car and raped her and tightened a ligature around her neck until she passed out. He then threw her into a lake and when she tried to reach the shore threw rocks at her.

His 23-year-old second victim was attacked a month later, and was raped while Kennedy held his hands around her throat.

He pleaded guilty to the two rapes in 1979 and was jailed, the jury was told.

Kennedy, who changed his name to Citro in 2003, denies murder but admits perverting the course of justice by sending the two letters to police.

Mr Bennetts told the court: 'The prosecution case is based upon circumstantial evidence - DNA, differing accounts given by James Citro and letters written by him to divert attention from him.

'Why else would he write the letters?'

The trial continues.
