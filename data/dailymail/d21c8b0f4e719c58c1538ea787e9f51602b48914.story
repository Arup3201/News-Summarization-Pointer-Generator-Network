Wayne Rooney moved joint-third alongside Jimmy Greaves on England's all-time scoring list after netting from the penalty spot during his 100th cap in the Three Lions' 3-1 victory over Slovenia.

The England captain stormed into the box and was tripped as he won the penalty himself just moments after Jordan Henderson's own goal had put Slovenia ahead at Wembley on Saturday.

But the Three Lions' 29-year-old skipper smashed in the equaliser from the spot to move on to 44 goals for his nation - just five shy of Sir Bobby Charlton's England record of 49  and level with Jimmy Greaves.

Before the match, fellow-centurion Charlton had presented the Manchester United forward with his golden cap for his 100th appearance for England.

And Rooney was overwhelmed by the occasion and delighted to walk out at Wembley with his children Kai and Klay before the game to become a centurion. 

He told ITV: 'It's a special night for me. It's an honour to represent England 100 times and hopefully many more times to come.

'Walking out with my boys (at the start of the game) is something no-one will ever be able to take away from me.'

Danny Welbeck bagged a brace to ensure England continued their 100 per cent record in 2016 European Championship qualification.

And Rooney was pleased with the result in the end, believing his side showed great character to come back.

He continued: 'A good day in the end. It was tough because they took the lead and we had to show our character but that's good for us because we haven't had that since the World Cup.

'I think at the minute we've got a good winning mentality and I think we showed that once we went 1-0 down. Once we went behind I think we showed that by coming back and winning the game we are in a good place right now.'

The England captain also reserved special praise for his striking partner Welbeck. 

Rooney explained: 'He (Welbeck) doesn't have to prove anything to anyone. He's shown he's a top forward and the more games he's playing, he's getting better.

'He's a fantastic player and he's showing it for England and Arsenal.'
