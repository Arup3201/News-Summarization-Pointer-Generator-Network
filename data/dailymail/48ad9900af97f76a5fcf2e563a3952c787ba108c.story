A 19-year-old  girl who is suffering from terminal brain cancer has spoken of her daily battle with the disease - weeks after achieving her dream to play college basketball.

Lauren Hill, from Lawrenceburg, Indiana, was diagnosed with  diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) - a rare and inoperable tumor in the brain stem - 14 months ago.

In recent months, her condition has worsened: she now frequently suffers from severe headaches, dizziness and numbness in her body, leaving her dependent on her family and friends.

Speaking of her life with the disease, she said candidly:  'My body is shutting down, and there's nothing I can do. It's like losing your independence a bit. Being dependent is kind of hard.'

The teenager, who last month fulfilled her wish to play basketball for Mount St. Joseph University's Division III team in Cincinnati, said she has 'good hours' and 'bad hours' every day.

'I have hour spurts when I feel fine and I can walk normal and stuff. Other hours, I'm wobbling. I feel like there's somebody behind me kicking my legs out from under me,' she told USA Today Sports. 

She added that dying makes her feel like she is in a rush to complete everything she wants to do, including her brave, ongoing campaign to raise awareness and fund research into DIPG.

'What is it like to know you're dying? It's like I want to get stuff done. Like I'm in a rush. People are told they have five weeks to live, and they live five years. I don't know,' she said.

'I want everybody to know I never give up, even though I have my low moments and I feel like giving up, because they're awful. My family gets me back on track to my never-give-up.' 

She said her main concern was not for herself, but for 'my family and friends after I've gone'.  

Her passion: In recent months, Lauren's condition has worsened: she now  suffers from severe headaches, dizziness and numbness in her body. But she looked on great form as she played basketball last month

Indeed, Lauren has not let her terminal illness stop her from fundraising for research into DIPG, which claims the lives of more than 90 per cent of its child victims within 18 months of diagnosis. 

She has already raised more than $500,000 - and aims to increase this figure to $1million by the end of the year, despite being previously told by doctors she would likely die by December.

A Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a rare an inoperable type of brain tumor.

It mostly affects children, with most diagnoses occurring between five and seven years of age. More than 90 per cent of its victims will die within 18 months of diagnosis.

Each year, there are around 100-150 new diagnoses in the United States. 

The cause of the tumor remains unknown. 

Symptoms include lack of facial control, double vision, headaches, vomiting, weakness, seizures and balance problems. 

She has been spurred on in her fundraising efforts by her knowledge that medics have not made any progress for 30 years toward finding a cure for the deadly cancer, she said.

DIPG, which is usually diagnosed between the ages of five and seven, affects around 100 to 150 children in the U.S. every year.

Since her first game for Mount St. Joseph in early November, 5ft 10ins Lauren, who wants to be 'a voice for children with this cancer' has played two more basketball games for the university. 

Due to her devastating prognosis, the NCAA approved a waiver for Mount St Joseph to start its season two weeks earlier, and the team tipped off against Hiram College with Lauren on court. 

On November 6, the talented university freshman joined a number of top athletes who have had their photos printed on a box of Wheaties, the Breakfast of Champions.

In Lauren's picture, she could seen playing in the first of the three basketball games, during which she scored the first points of the winning match.

She even recently received a pair of Beats headphones from LeBron James, as well as one of his size-17 sneakers. She has also received a number of gifts from members of the public. 

Comparing her life with basketball, Lauren said she was 'playing to the final buzzer, not worrying about the last play or the play that's coming... All we have is the moment we have right now.' 

However, she said she is looking forward to one event - spending Christmas with her family.

But she has not asked for any gifts. 'No material item matters to me. I just want to spend time with my family,' she said.  To donate to The Lauren Hill Tribute Foundation, visit layups4Lauren.org.
