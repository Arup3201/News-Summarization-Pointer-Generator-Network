The average woman spends almost an entire month a year worrying about her appearance, a study revealed yesterday.

Researchers found concerns about curves, weight and what to wear at Christmas parties and other events means women spend an average of 12 hours and four minutes a week fretting – or 627 hours and 28 minutes across the year.

Other concerns include being too fat, too thin, too bloated, having spotty skin, pale skin and frizzy hair.

Fretting: Research found women spend an average of 627 hours a year thinking  about their appearance

The study shows the average female spends 50 minutes a week deciding what to wear, and a further one hour and 32 minutes worrying if it looks OK.

They take up to 39 minutes a week deciding on lingerie and spend an hour and 46  minutes worrying about weight. However,  48 per cent of those questioned admit too much time is spent worrying about appearances.

Michele Duncan of Lycra Beauty, which commissioned the study of 2,000 women, said: ‘To think women are spending such a large amount of their time concerned about their appearance is surprising.’
