In a land where they are despised, feared and even hunted for their body parts, the albinos of Tanzania have found a refuge that offers them a glimmer of hope for the future.

The Kabanaga Protectorate Centre in the town of Kabanaga in the north-west of the East African country, close to the Burundi border, caters to the nation's albinos, who are known as the 'tribe of ghosts', 'zeros' or 'the invisibles'.

They have suffered appalling treatment at the hands of their own neighbours and are murdered for their body parts, which are believed to bring good fortune and cure all manner of ills.

Associated Press staff photojournalist Jacquelyn Martin,
based in Washington in the U.S, visited the centre to chronicle those who 
are treated with fear and contempt for a simple genetic fluke.

'The children break your heart,' says Jacquelyn, who travelled to the centre as part of the personal project. 'Especially the ones who have been abandoned - They are uniquely beautiful people.'

The 70-or-so albinos, who range in age from newborns to sexagenarians, are at the centre for a combination of factors.

Sometimes the parents are afraid of 
their children, sometimes they are forced to give up their beloved 
offspring because they fear the prejudices of the people in their own 
community.

'Despite everything they've been 
through and what they are probably going to have to face in the future,' says Jacquelyn. 'They really wanted to go back to their villages and live a normal life.

'There's a sense of community in the centre, where older people take care of the babies and younger children.'

Albinism is a genetic condition characterised by a deficiency of melanin pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes which protects from the sun's ultraviolet rays.

In many African nations - but most commonly in Tanzania - albinos are butchered in the street.

Their remains are used in the macabre human potions used by traditional healers to treat the sick

Believing it will bring them good luck and big catches, fishermen on the shores Lake Victoria weave albino hair into nets.

Bones are ground down and buried in the earth by miners, who believe they will be transformed into diamonds.

The genitals are also sometimes made into treatments to boost sexual potency.

One of the albinos is 17-year-old Angel, who was visited by her mother from a remote and poor part of the country for the first time in four years.

When she was born her father called her 'a gift from God'.

But his joy was not that of a new 
father - he wanted to butcher the girl and sell her body parts for 
thousands of dollars, a fortune to the average family in Tanzania

Angel's
 mother was filled with love for her daughter and managed to deter the 
father for years, but when Angel was 13 he led a group to attack her.

Angel got away, but her mother's own parents were killed in the attack as they fought to protect their granddaughter.

But Jacquelyn says she will never escape the prejudice that follows her wherever she goes.

'There's
 a market close to the centre and the women went together in a group as a
 safety measure because it's harder to kidnap someone in a group,' says Jacquelyn. 'Angel was in a shop and the woman behind the counter couldn'tÂ  look her in the eyes.

'She just took her money. That was something that struck me.'

Ignorance
 about the condition is rife - there is even a belief that their mothers
 slept with white men to give them the condition.

'Sometimes it's less about beliefs than pure economics,' says Jacquelyn. '[But] there was this note of strength in all of the ones I met; all of them had hopes for something greater.'

'One wanted to be a politician to help
 other albinos, another wanted to be a lawyer to fight for their rights,
 one wanted to be a teacher to educate people about the condition and 
another wanted to be a journalist to report about people with albinism.'

But it is a long and steep slope to 
climb before Tanzania truly wakes up to the terrible plight that faces 
each albino born into this world.

In February attackers collecting body 
parts of albinos for witchcraft hacked off the hand of a seven-year-old 
boy, officials said.

The boy, called Mwigulu Magessa, was ambushed by the men as he walked home with his 
friends in Tanzania. He survived but many such victims of ignorance are not so lucky.

Just days earlier an albino mother of
 four had her arm chopped off by machete-wielding men and a month before
 that an albino child died in Tanzania's Tabora region after attackers 
hacked off his arm.'

Tribe of ghosts: Eumen Ezekiel, 13, was attacked in 2007 and hasn't seen his mother since. 'I want to be a member of parliament and defend others living with albinism,' he said

There is very little being done by the government other than putting them in centres to ensure their safety,' Jacquelyn adds. 'They are just sweeping them under the rug, there isn't a long-term solution.

'It was hard to leave the children in 
this situation and I hope my photography has put a human face on the 
issue and I hope they see themselves as I see them - beautiful people 
who deserve a chance in life.'

Jacquelyn collaborated with the non-profit organisation Asante Mariamu
 during her trip to the centre, which is housed in the Kabanga Primary School, a government boarding school for disabled children.

The organisation is dedicated to raising awareness about the ongoing
 human rights crisis impacting people with albinism in East Africa.

They
 seek to teach people with albinism about the condition, so that they 
can better understand how to protect themselves from skin cancer.

They also work to dispel the myths surrounding the condition to increase acceptance in society.

Providing
 direct relief with sun protective gear and sunscreen, Asante Mariamu 
also seeks to empower people with albinism by providing opportunities 
for education so that they can become vital and valuable members of 
society.
