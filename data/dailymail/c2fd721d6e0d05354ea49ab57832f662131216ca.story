Bruce Grobbelaar insists that Brendan Rodgers' faith in goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, not the sale of Luis Suarez, is at the heart of Liverpool's problems this season.

Liverpool conceded 50 goals in the Barclays Premier League last season as they finished second, two points behind Manchester City who let in 13 goals fewer.

Those defensive woes have continued this season with 18 goals already conceded by Mignolet in 12 games and Grobbelaar - one of the greatest goalkeepers ever to play for Liverpool - told BBC Sport that the Belgian is the problem.

The Zimbabwean said: 'Any team that lets in 50 goals should never be in second position in the first place. That was masked and brushed over by the brilliance of Suarez and [Daniel] Sturridge scoring so many goals.'

Grobbelaar added: 'You've got to shore up at the back, get yourself someone in goal that can only let in 30 goals a season, or less than 30 goals a season.'

Asked if he thought Mignolet - who Rodgers signed from Sunderland two years ago - was the problem, Grobbelaar responded: 'I've always said that. I've said that he doesn't command his area.'

He went on: 'I have likened him worse than Dracula, because at least Dracula comes out of his coffin now and then. He seems to stay on his line and that's it.

'That whole area - not the six-yard area, the 18-yard area - is the goalkeeper's, and in this day and age, in modern goalkeeping, if you come out and catch the ball and you get smacked you are going to get the foul.

'It's not rocket science, and he is a big lad. As soon as that ball is in the air - get out, come for it.

'You're going to get a lot more fouls for you and less are going to go in the back of the net.'

In 13 years at Liverpool, Grobbelaar won six titles, three FA Cups, three League Cups and one European Cup.
