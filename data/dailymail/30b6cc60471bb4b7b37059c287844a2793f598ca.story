A new Catholic women's initiative rolled out by the Vatican is at the centre of a storm of criticism over a video starring a 'sexy blonde'.

The Internet promotional video, featuring blonde Italian actress Nancy Brilli, came under such ridicule that it was quickly taken down, it has been reported. 

In the clip, the 50-year-old, dressed in a blue top, asks her viewers how often they ask themselves 'Who are you? What do you do? What do you think about yourself as a woman?'

But the video soon sparked criticism from around the English speaking world.

'What were they thinking at the Vatican?' wrote Phyllis Zagano of Hofstra University in the National Catholic Reporter.

'Aside from the obvious - sexy sell has long gone by the boards in developed nations and is totally unacceptable in predominantly Muslim countries - the fact of the matter is that highlighting a stereotypical spokeswoman is not the way to ask for women's input.' 

The women's initiative came courtesy of Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi whose office launched the #lifeofwomen crowd-sourcing scheme just before Christmas.

It was rolled out in a bid to promote an inaugural meeting this week aimed at studying women's issues.

Women were invited from around the globe to send in a 60-second video of their lives for possible inclusion in a montage to be screened at the 'big meeting of cardinals and bishops'.

The English version of Brilli's promo was taken down, though the Italian remains on the ministry's website, Associated Press reports.

Critics noted that the women the Vatican might most want to hear from - those suffering from poverty, violence or war - might not have a smart phone at hand to send in a clip

Critics noted that the women the Vatican might most want to hear from - those suffering from poverty, violence or war - might not have a smart phone at hand to send in a clip. 

Others pointed out that the two-week deadline - at the height of the Christmas holidays - worked against any widespread response.

The working paper for the Pontifical Council of Culture's plenary assembly on 'Women's Cultures: Equality and Difference' speaks about opening the church's doors to women so they can offer their skills 'in full collaboration and integration' with men.

It denounces plastic surgery as a form of 'aggression' against the female body 'like a burqa made of flesh.' And it acknowledges that the church has for centuries offered women 'ideological and ancestral left-overs.'

In the end, some 250 videos were sent in with a number of them coming from activists advocating for women's ordination.

Consuela Corradi, a sociologist at Rome's Catholic Lumsa university, was one of 15 women who advised Ravasi on the initiative. She complained that criticism of the video was unfair.

'If we had chosen an ugly woman, would that have changed the message? I don't think so,' she said. 

She said the women consultants were entirely responsible for penning the working document, with no interference from the ministry, though she said their document was trimmed for length.
