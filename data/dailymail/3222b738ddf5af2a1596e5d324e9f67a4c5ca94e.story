Heart-stopping camera footage has been released of two gunmen calmly strolling through Tunisia's National Bardo musuem in the terror attack which left 23 people dead. 

The one-minute video posted on the government's Interior Ministry Facebook page shows the two men scurrying through the Tunis museum, carrying assault rifles and bags.

One of the attackers is wearing a baseball cap and a heavy jacket, while the other has a red hoodie and tracksuit pants. 

At one point, they encounter another man with a backpack walking down a flight of stairs. 

They briefly acknowledge each other and let the unidentified man walk free before unleashing the deadly attack in the country's largest museum.

The video also shows stills of the dead gunmen who were killed in a firefight with security forces, including a picture indicating at least one was wearing an explosive belt.  

ISIS claimed Wednesday's attack on foreign tourists in Tunis, the deadliest involving foreigners in Tunisia since a 2002 suicide bombing on the island of Djerba.  

Tunisian fighters make up a disproportionately high number of foreign recruits to ISIS in Syria, with as many as 10,000 having signed up.

The government said the two gunmen had trained in jihadi camps in Libya before the attack inside the heavily secured Tunisian parliament compound.  

Among the 23 dead in Wednesday's attack, 17 were cruise ship tourists, including British mother-of-two Sally Adey. They also included a Tunisian policeman. 

Mrs Adey, 57, from Shropshire, had been on a cruise of the Mediterranean with her husband, Robert, and was on an excursion to the museum.

Tunisia's largest museum, built in a 15th Century palace

Contains 8,000 works, including one of the world's largest collections of Roman mosaics

Some items in the collection are more than 40,000 years old

A new wing was added in 2009, doubling its size

The victims included a Tunisian police officer and tourists from Japan, Italy, Colombia, Australia, Spain, France and Poland. 

Police in Tunisia have arrested five people described as directly tied to the two gunmen.  

Four others said to be supporters of the cell were also arrested in central Tunisia, not far from where a group claiming allegiance to al Qaida's North African branch has been active.

ISIS issued a statement and audio on jihadi websites applauding the dead gunmen as 'knights' for their 'blessed invasion of one of the dens of infidels and vice in Muslim Tunisia'.  

As investigations into the massacre continue, Tunisian security officials have been asked why the world-famous museum was completely unprotected. 

The government now plans to deploy the army to major cities to bolster security following the shootings. 

In an address to mark 59 years of independence from France yesterday, Tunisia's president Beji Caid Essebsi said: 'We won't win if we don't stand together. We will be merciless in the defence of our country.' 

The attack is a huge blow for Tunisia's tourism industry (which accounts for seven per cent of the country’s GDP) and its government. 

It comes at a fragile moment for a country just emerging to full democracy after a popular uprising four years ago. 

Elsewhere today, hundreds of people gathered for a mass in the cathedral, lighting candles to remember the victims in a ceremony attended by government ministers.
