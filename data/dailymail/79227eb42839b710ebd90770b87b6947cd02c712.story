Hundreds of skeletal remains have been found scattered around ranches along the U.S.-Mexico border, during a police search for missing people.

The remains had been left in the open and burned, making identification difficult for the Mexican authorities.

The discovery, announced by Coahuila state prosecutor spokesman Jesus Carranza on Monday, came as 12 bodies were unearthed in southern Mexico, and two months after 67 bodies were found in the west.

Such discoveries remain common despite government claims that the number of killings has gone down in the past year.

Police in Coahuila haven't said whether an organized crime group is suspected in the discovery of skeletal remains, but the area is known to be dominated by the violent Zetas drug cartel.

Officers have arrested 10 men, including four police officers suspected of aiding a criminal group, the state attorney general's office said in a press release.

The police operation took place on ranches in 11 different towns around the border city of Piedras Negras, right across Eagle Pass, Texas, after interviews with family members and at least 32 former local officials.

Usually, remains like these have been found in mass graves, but these were left on the surface in the region known as Five Springs, Carranza said.

At some of the ranches, investigators found bullet casings as well as barrels of diesel fuel that was likely used to burn bodies.

'We are still not sure how many skeletal remains and how many victims we are talking about,' Carranza said. 'But this operation was launched to try to locate missing people.'

An organization that supports families of missing victims has gathered 321 cases between 2007 and 2013 in just Coahuila.

Families were worried that the government contaminated the crime scenes after seeing images from local media showing the use of heavy machinery at the search sites.

'It makes you want to cry. It's unbelievable how they handle evidence. It just complicates the identification of the remains,' Guadalupe Fernandez, a member of Forces United for our Disappeared in Coahuila, said.

Her son Jose Antonio Robledo, an engineer, went missing in 2009.

The state prosecutors' office said it followed protocols of preservation in crime scene investigations.

In Guerrero state, the attorney general's office said a dozen bodies were found Sunday in the town of Mexcaltepec by military personnel after they received an anonymous tip Saturday night.

In the same state and only a few days before, members of armed self-defense groups found a clandestine grave in the town of Cajelitos near the state capital of Chilpancingo and reported the skeletons of three men and two women.

Two months ago, authorities excavated for several days in recovering 67 bodies that had been bound or gagged in a remote town by Lake Chapala, a popular spot with tourists and American retirees.

It is a region where the Knights Templar and New Generation drug cartels are fighting each other. Local police officers who confessed to handing over people to the New Generation organization led investigators to the scene, officials said.
