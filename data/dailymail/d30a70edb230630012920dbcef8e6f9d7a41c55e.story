Veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke has revealed that he blocked Margaret Thatcher privatising the NHS as Health Secretary in the 1980s.

The former Cabinet minister who was sacked in last week's reshuffle said Mrs Thatcher wanted to 'go to the American system' but he refused.

Mr Clarke has also lifted the lid on his rows with Number 10 under David Cameron - and how the Tory press office tried to block him going on TV by pretending that he was ill.

Ken Clarke has left office with a parting shot at David Cameron - and revelations that the Tories tried to sell off the NHS

Mr Clarke, speaking to the Observer, said he had stand-up rows with Mrs Thatcher over her health proposals.

He said: 'I had ferocious rows with her about it. She wanted compulsory insurance, with the state paying the premiums for the less well-off.

'I thought that was a disaster. The American system is hopeless, dreadful.'

He also reveals how he had a 'great row' with the Tory head office a few months ago when they told the BBC he was ill and couldn't go on Question Time when, in fact, he was in rude health and raring to go.

Mr Clarke said he rang the producer of the show, adding: 'She said "I'm told you're ill". After that I got even more freelance.'

The former Chancellor also lashed out at the growing euroscepticism in the Tory party.

In a parting shot against Mr Cameron he said a vote to leave the EU would leave the Prime Minister a diminished figure on the world stage.

He said: 'Being prime minister will be a less important job if we leave the European Union. You'd become a minor player in all kinds of situations.'

Deriding the view of Eurosceptics that the UK could forge its own bilateral agreements outside the EU, he says: 'The idea that the United Kingdom could negotiate a serious trade deal with the United States on its own … is ridiculous.'

Mr Clarke also downplayed the current economic recovery - and said it had some way to go before it was real.

He said housing bubbles followed by collapses remained a British disease that has now spread outside London.

Ken Clarke spent three days watching the cricket at Trent Bridge earlier this month, before being sacked from the Cabinet by the Prime Minister

He said: 'I very much hope the British are going to get out of this ludicrous cycle of ridiculous housing booms followed by housing crashes.'

Echoing one of the central messages of Labour leader Ed Miliband, he said: 'We don't want to be a low-skills, low-productivity, long-hours economy.'

He added: 'We're only halfway through … We've saved the country from calamity but we've got a long way to go before we get a competitive economy, with sustainable levels of growth and all that.'
