Aspirational: Iain Duncan Smith said Conservatives should be less 'hateful' when speaking to voters

Iain Duncan Smith has said that the Tories need to stop their 'finger-wagging' and be more positive about what they stand for.

The Work and Pensions Secretary went on to say he agreed with Treasury minister Nicky Morgan who has argued that the Conservatives should be less ‘hateful’ and more ‘aspirational’ when speaking to voters.

And he insisted his benefits cuts were not about bashing the poor, but prompting a ‘positive life change’.

Mr Duncan Smith even likened his zeal for overhauling welfare to the crusade to end slavery, comparing himself with the great abolitionist William Wilberforce and the Victorian social reformer, the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury.

He said reforming the benefits system was ‘part of our party’s historic mission.

‘Shaftesbury and Wilberforce were people who faced a massive problem, a social problem, and saw only the need to change it, and embarked on that change against the vested interests and accepted wisdom of their age, and the results you can see were massive and transformational,’ he said. 

Like them, Mr Duncan Smith added, he wanted to ‘put hope back where it has gone, to give  people from chaotic lives security through hard work, helping families improve the quality of their own lives’.

He backed comments earlier this week by Mrs Morgan that the Conservatives needed to change their ‘language and tone’.

She told a think-tank that Tories too often say that, 'we’re anti this, we’re anti-that, we don’t like them, we don’t want them here'.

The Loughborough MP added: 'If we talk about what we hate all the time, we’re not talking about what we like and what we want to do to help people who want to do well in setting up businesses or making our schools the best.

'We never say actually we are on the side of these people, we want this to happen and we think this  is great.'

Mission: Iain Duncan Smith insists his benefits cuts were not about bashing the poor, such as those featured on Channel 4's Benefits Street (pictured), but were instead designed to prompt 'positive life changes'

Asked if he agreed, Mr Duncan Smith told Radio 4’s The World at One: 'Yes, absolutely. The last thing that politicians and others should do is to be judgmental.

'I’m in favour of talking about what we believe will improve life, not always finger-wagging.'

In a speech to the Centre for Social Justice, a think-tank he set up in opposition, Mr Duncan Smith said people should stop disapproving of benefit claimants – 'our fellow citizens' – and instead blame politicians for  creating a system that consigned them to the 'twilight world' of state dependency.

'Casual disapproval of those on benefits is also too easy,' he added.

'It does us as politicians well to remember that it was generations of politicians that created this welfare system that now traps them.'

He later said his speech had been trying to emphasise that  people had been 'locked away' from 'productive life' by the benefits system.

The number of workless households had fallen by 18 per cent under the Coalition, while there were fewer people who were economically inactive than in the last two decades, he added.

Labour's work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: 'This is no time for self-congratulatory speeches from Iain Duncan Smith. His time would be better spent getting a grip of his lamentable policies and the hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money he is needlessly wasting.'

TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: 'Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms have led to elderly and disabled people being kicked out of their homes for failing to pay the hated bedroom tax, while dying cancer sufferers have faced benefit sanctions for not finding work. 

'To compare this Government-directed cruelty to the abolition of slavery is frankly offensive'
