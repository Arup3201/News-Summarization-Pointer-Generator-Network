A superdad who worked 'round the clock' to support his 16 children has died of a heart attack at the age of 56.

Terry Harvey, from Cardiff, always wanted a lot of children because he was from a big family himself - but his family said he never dreamed he would have so many.

After meeting his wife Marie in 1979, the pair went on to have 12 girls and four boys, as well as 33 grandchildren. There were five more on the way when Mr Harvey died.

Mrs Harvey, to whom he was married for 35 years, said she was 'heartbroken' at her husband's sudden death.

A family spokesman said: 'Terry was a brilliant dad - he worked long hours but always helped to look after the children getting up in the middle of the night to help when they were young.

'He was always proud of supporting his large family despite many people advising him that he might be better off claiming benefits.

'He used to say: "I didn't have my kids for the Government to support them - that's my job".' 

Mr Harvey had met his wife Marie, with whom he is pictured left and right in 1999, at a working men's club in 1979 and they married just eight weeks later

Mr Harvey was a proud grandfather and was singing 'Under the Sea' to them from the Little Mermaid the day before he died. He is pictured here with some of his family in 2010 

Mr Harvey, one of seven children himself, used to say Marie was a supermum running one of the smoothest households in Britain from their five-bedroom home in Llanedeyrn, Cardiff. 

Together they looked after their children Machala, 36, Leanne, 34, Tracey, 33, Samantha, 32, Christopher, 31, Colin, 29, Jodie, 28, Amy, 26, Kimberly, 25, Loretta, 23, Daniel, 22, Roxanne, 21, Shikera, 18 and Shane, 15. 

One of their children, Shiola, died when she was five days old. Jessica died before she was born.

What a family: Despite working long hours, Mr Harvey always helped look after the children (pictured in 1991), getting up in the middle of the night to help when they were young

Mr Harvey used to say his wife was a 'supermum', running their home like a military operation 

After Shiola's death, Mr Harvey had a reverse vasectomy operation so he could go on to have more children.

Paying tribute to their father, his children said Mr Harvey gave them good morals and a sense of hard work.

His eldest daughter Machala Evans said: 'Dad was a simple man, who loved his work and his family.

'He really was a family man, who was very patient and relaxed with his children and grandchildren, but he did ask for respect and the children knew that.

'He was a brilliant grandfather - he probably knew the words to every Disney song! His grandchildren are missing him so badly.'

During his career as a steel worker, Mr Harvey helped build the Severn Bridge, the Cardiff Bay barrage and a new cancer unit at the University Hospital of Wales. 

He also worked on the police station in Cardiff Bay along with many of the other big developments in Cardiff.

His biggest job recently was working on the incinerator waste facility in Splott. 

Despite working long hours, Mr Harvey always helped look after the children getting up in the middle of the night to help when they were young. 

Since his death, Mrs Harvey and her children have taken comfort from the respect shown by Mr Harvey's workmates who downed their tools after hearing he had died.

The family spokesman said: 'Terry loved his job and was always cheerful while working he would even get told off for singing too much.

'He had a great sense of humour and delighted in teaching his African Grey parrot Mickey to swear.

'He loved spending time at his caravan on the coast on the Gower coast where he would relax with Marie and the children.

Mr Harvey, who was born in 1958, died suddenly on September 16. Building sites across South Wales shut down for his funeral today after he made a lifelong list of friends.

He was the fifth of seven children and lived with his siblings Christine, Angela, Catherine, David, Gareth and Susan.

When he finished school, he trained as a steel fixer with his dad, who was also called Terry, but who was known as Tecca.  

Mr and Mrs Harvey met in a working men's club in Cwmbran and got married in the registry office in Pontypool just eight weeks later in August 1979. 

Mrs Harvey - who had wanted to be a nun when she was growing up - organised family life like a military operation and with enough food to feed a small army.

She used to say her washing machine was on 'virtually all day every day' and the toughest part of being a mum to so many was putting more than 200 socks into pairs every week.

She often cooks for up to 30 people four times a week, when a selection of her children, their partners and her grandchildren visit the home.  

Mr Harvey loved spending time at his caravan at Port Einon, where the family would relax by playing card games, with him and Mrs Harvey 'cheating' to win all the sweets.

He was fond of animals and adored his Great Dane Zana. His family said his grandchildren will remember him as a great playmate singing 'Under the Sea' from the Little Mermaid to them the day before he died.
