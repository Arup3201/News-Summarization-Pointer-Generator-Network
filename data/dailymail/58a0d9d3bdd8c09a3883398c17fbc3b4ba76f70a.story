One of America's biggest ice-skating stars has been suspended from the sport for two years after admitting to tampering with the skates of a Canadian rival.

Simon Cho, 21, who admitted in October 2012 to sabotaging Olivier Jean's skates during the World Team Championship, was suspended until October 4, 2014, U.S. Speedskating announced.

The ban means that Cho, who won a bronze relay medal at the 2010 Vancouver Games, will not be able to compete in the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

After initially denying wrongdoing, Cho said in October that he used a blade bender to sabotage his rival's skates, the Associated Press reported.

But he said former short track national coach Jae Su Chun told him to do so because he believed the Canadians had helped another team to eliminate the Americans.

After the U.S. team had already been eliminated, he tampered with the skates using a blade bender normally used to ensure the blade follows the proper radius of the track.

Last October Cho explained: 'The 
repetitiveness and aggressiveness of how he came at me was very 
intimidating... I knew he wasn't going to take no for an answer.'

The tampering meant the Canadians were unable to skate for gold, leaving them in the bronze position. The cause came to light during an inquiry into the actions of Chun after complaints stacked up against him.

Chun has denied any involvement but the International Skating Union also imposed a suspension on him, saying he violated the sport's code of ethics. His ban is in effect until August 25, 2015.

Cho, who trained in Salt Lake City before moving to Upper Marlboro, Maryland before trying out for the Olympics, has called sabotaging the skates 'the biggest mistake of my life'.

'I always knew it was wrong that day,' 
Cho said last October. 'I hope that I can make up for my mistake and 
continue to skate in the future.'

U.S. Speedskating issued a statement saying it 'respects the findings of the ISU' and will refer the matter to its disciplinary panel for a final decision.

The ruling came on the same day the U.S. short track team was picked for the upcoming World Cup season, an important step for a program that has been wracked by organizational infighting and allegations that coaches were abusive.

Cho did not take part in the selection meet.

'As an organization, we are focused on supporting our athletes as they begin the season and work toward competing on the international stage the 2014 Olympic Winter Games,' U.S. Speedskating said in its statement.

Cho appeared to be one of the rising stars in the U.S. He won a relay bronze medal at the Vancouver Games and an individual world championship in 2011.
