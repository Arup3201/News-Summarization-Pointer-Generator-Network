Barcelona have completed the signing of French defender Jeremy Mathieu from Valencia in a £16million deal.

The 30-year-old will put pen to paper on a four-year deal at the Nou Camp and will have a buyout clause of £39.5million.

Mathieu's addition continues Luis Enrique's overhaul of the Catalans after a season in which they won no major silverware.

Luis 
Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and goalkeepers Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Claudio 
Bravo have already arrived at the club this summer and Enrique has now 
strengthened the club's defence following the retirement of Carles 
Puyol.

Javier
 Mascherano has previously played that role but it is believed Enrique 
has earmarked him for a spot in midfield after his performances in that 
position for Argentina at the 2014 World Cup helped them reach the 
final.

Mathieu is likely to compete alongside Gerard Pique and Marc Bartra for a place in the heart of Barcelona's defence.
