The body of a two-star general killed in an Afghan 'insider attack' arrived Thursday at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be prepared for burial at Arlington National Cemetery.

A C-17 cargo plane carrying the body of Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, 55, landed under blue skies at the Dover base, home to the nation's largest military mortuary.

Air Force chaplain Maj. Melvin K. Smith boarded the plane to offer a prayer.

White-gloved soldiers then solemnly carried a flag-draped metal case with Greene's remains to a waiting mortuary vehicle as Army Secretary John McHugh stood solemnly and Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno gave a farewell salute.

His family, including his 
daughter Amelia Greene, daughter-in-law Kasandra Greene, son Army First 
Lieutenant Matthew Greene and wife retired Colonel Susan Myers were all there to witness the heartbreaking moment.

 dead: Major General  Harold J. Greene, of Falls Church, Virginia, is

 Vietnam

Although the movement was carried out in silence, there were soft sobs that could be heard as members of the general’s immediate family watched the procession.

In an unusual step for casualty transfers
 at Dover, members of Greene's family were escorted onto the plane at 
their request to thank members of the flight crew.

Greene is the highest-ranked U.S. officer to be killed in combat since 1970 during the Vietnam War. Greene, a 34-year U.S. Army veteran, also is the highest-ranked American officer killed in combat in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

An Afghan soldier killed Greene and wounded 15 other allied troops Tuesday, including a German general and two Afghan generals.

The
 soldier who opened fire was subsequently killed in a shootout. There 
was no indication that Greene was specifically targeted.

An
 Afghan military official said Wednesday that the gunman, who went by 
the name Rafiqullah, hid in a bathroom with a NATO assault rifle, then 
opened fire when a group of officers from international forces passed 
by.

The official spoke 
on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the 
information. A second Afghan military official corroborated his account.

There has been no claim of responsibility in the shooting.

Insider attacks in Afghanistan rose sharply in 2012, with more than 60 coalition troops — mostly Americans — killed in more than 40 attacks that threatened to shatter all trust between Afghan and allied forces.

US commanders imposed a series of precautionary tactics and the number of such attacks declined sharply last year.

Such attacks are sometimes claimed by the Taliban insurgency as proof of their infiltration.

Others are attributed to personal disputes or resentment by Afghans who have soured on the continued international presence in their country more than a dozen years after the fall of the Taliban's ultra-conservative Islamic regime.

There has been no claim of responsibility in Tuesday's shooting that killed Greene and wounded at least 15 others, including a German general and two Afghan generals at Marshal Fahim National Defense University, west of the Afghan capital, Kabul.

Greene's death was the latest in what is a persistent problem endemic to Westerners training Afghan recruits: insider attacks

Greene will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery

The attack 
has raised fresh questions about the ability of NATO soldiers stationed 
in Afghanistan to train local forces, and will undermine trust between 
them at a crucial time.

Most
 foreign soldiers plan to withdraw from the war-torn country by the end 
of 2014, but, recognizing the challenge Afghan forces face in battling a
 vicious insurgency led by the Taliban, a contingent could remain beyond
 the deadline in a training and counter-insurgency role.

At
 their peak in 2012, so-called 'insider' attacks threatened the very 
foundation of the US-led mission in Afghanistan and prompted the 
coalition to bring in a host of measures to reduce interaction with 
their local allies.

The number of incidents fell from nearly 50 in 2012 to about 15 last year.

'Despite
 all security measures, such attacks by insiders can never be totally 
ruled out,' a German defense ministry spokesman said.

The
 coalition, called the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), 
insisted the attack would not compromise their plans to train and assist
 Afghanistan's fledgling armed forces, built from scratch after the 
Taliban were ousted in 2001.
