For drivers planning to embark on a journey across snowy terrain, this quirky looking vehicle might seem an unlikely mode of transport.

But back in 1925, this Model T Ford with a crude set of bright blue skis and chains attached was at the forefront of winter travel.

It was in 1913 that madcap U.S. inventor Virgil D White hit upon the idea of the 'Snow Flyer' kits, which - when attached to a Model T - transformed the popular motor car into the world's first snowmobile.

The inventor sold his kits for around $400 almost a century ago, and now this 1925 example is expected to fetch upwards of £10,000 when it goes under the hammer in Pennsylvania, U.S., next month.

At the time the kits - which consisted of skis made of metal and wood and rear-mounted chain link tracks -were particularly popular with country doctors, who used them to battle the elements when visiting patients in rural areas in winter months.

Today the souped-up cars are equally in demand among collectors, and there is even a Ford T snowmobile owners' club.

A spokesman from the club said: 'The 
snowmobile became an indispensable convenience for the person requiring 
rapid, dependable transport in all kinds of weather.

'Country doctors and rural mail carriers were the largest users of this type of vehicle.'

The spokesman said other customers 
included public utility companies, lumber firms, travelling salesmen, 
fire departments, taxi drivers, grocers, milkmen and undertakers.

'When the father of President Calvin 
Coolidge died on March 18, 1926, a Model T Snowmobile led the Coolidge 
funeral procession over the snow-covered hills of Vermont,' he added.

Despite their popularity, demand for Virgil D White's kits faded with the introduction of the snowplough, and the inventor eventually sold his firm.

The kits remained in production up until World War II.

'Makers of the attachment 
claimed the ability to travel over two and a half feet of unbroken snow 
at an average speed of 18 miles per hour,' the club spokesman said.

'Those who had a snowmobile certainly used it with great satisfaction.'
