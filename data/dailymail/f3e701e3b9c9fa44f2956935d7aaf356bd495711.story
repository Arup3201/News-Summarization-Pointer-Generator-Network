Roy Keane says Paul Lambert can trust him to make his life easier as Aston Villa manager and believes his own experience as a top-flight boss will only aid their relationship.

The former Manchester United captain has surprised some by stepping into an assistant role after No 1 jobs at Sunderland and Ipswich – but Keane said: ‘I’m here to help the manager.

‘I think I can bring something to the party. We'll give it a go. My experience as a manager will help because I know how difficult it can be - hopefully I'll make it easier. I'll be someone Paul can trust. I want to help the players.

‘From a selfish point of view it will help me, working with players in the Premier League. I think it can be done.

‘Like
 lots of clubs they've had a difficult two or three years, I'm aware the
 club is up for sale - that didn't put me off. Hopefully there'll be one
 or two more signings in next couple of months.’

The
 pair played against each other in the Champions League semi-final of 
1997 when Borussia Dortmund beat United and then got chatting when Kevin
 Lisbie moved from Ipswich to Colchester United, Lambert’s former club. 
They played in a testimonial together too.

‘We
 played against each other, then had dealings as managers,’ said Keane. 
‘We've kept in touch and met up once or twice. We do know each other but
 we didn’t go to school together.’

Keane
 comes back to English football after three years out and will combine 
the role with being assistant manager of the Irish national team under 
Martin O’Neill.

Keane 
added: ‘I might not look it but I am excited. There are meetings with 
staff tomorrow, it will be nice to get on with the real work and get the
 players fit and sharp for the start of the season. I've had three years
 off so I should be ready.’

Lambert
 added: ‘He’s someone who I get on really well with, known for a while. 
I’m bringing him in because he can bring something to the table. I’m 
really looking forward to it.

‘He’s
 a top, top guy, great football person first and foremost. He’s played 
for one of the biggest clubs in the world, is one of the best players to
 come out of the Premier League.

‘If
 I never thought I could work with him, I wouldn’t have done it. 
Ultimately the manager of any football club will have the last word.’
