A house in chaos, a baby covered in clown make-up and her mother swallowing a sword - these are just a few of the outrageous pictures of circus performer Mackenzie Moltov and her daughter Ulee.

A sword-swallower and performer with an alternative cabaret circus troupe, Mackenzie, from Philadelphia, posed for the images to deliberately provoke people who criticise her way of life.

In the jaw-dropping shots Mackenzie, whose face is painted with clown make-up, breastfeeds her baby as she knocks back a glass of wine, in another shot Ulee grasps a huge knife and in the most shocking - achieved through the magic of Photoshop - Ulee is in flames on a barbecue.

The photo project came about after Mackenzie faced a backlash from the public after continuing to swallow swords in live shows late into her pregnancy.

Photographer Lori Foxworth took the pictures with Paul Cofield and Mackenzie is their regular muse. She said: 'We decided to exploit people's misconceptions of single mothers and play to their prejudices.

'Our "Bad Mommy" photo shoot is part of a larger piece of work documenting Mackenzie's journey.

'In the rest of the series we have photographed the sexy, sword swallowing, fire breathing aerialist from her days as a young performer to falling in love, getting pregnant and becoming a single parent.

'Currently, we are photographing her in abandoned and creepy amusement parks in full clown make-up and various stages of undress.'

The pair, who run Black, White & Raw Photography posted the pictures on their website. They wrote: 'MacKenzie is all about breaking the rules and challenging what the perception of pregnant women and ultimately motherhood is all about.

'In our latest shoot with MacKenzie entitled “Bad Mommy”, MacKenzie is joined by daughter Ulee, as she deliciously sinks into the character many of the general public perceive her to be: A self-centered, self indulgent, sex pot, interested only in drinking, partying and being fabulous, much to the dangerous neglect of her infant.'

The tongue-in-cheek post continues: 'As we went about the planning of this shoot, complete with Ulee being roasted in a pan, aborted on a bathroom floor, grilled on a barbecue and choked by a strand of pearls, I asked MacKenzie “Is it bad that all I think about is various ways to kill your baby?”

They also explain that the image of little Ulee in flames on the barbecue was created by digitally doctoring the shot and the message ends with the footnote: 'No clown babies were harmed in the making of these photos.'
