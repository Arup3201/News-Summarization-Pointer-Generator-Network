A last blast of winter blew through the Northeast on Tuesday, with snow and sleet delaying the start of school in some areas and making the morning commute an icy, slippery mess a day before spring starts.

The winter storm that started overnight Monday and early Tuesday might even continue into Tuesday night for northern areas.

Snow is expected to cover newly bare patches of ground and force people to gas up their snow blowers again on the last day of winter.

The snow that hit New York on Monday night came just hours before the formal start of spring, as much of the North East faced an unexpected storm

Cold: New York's storm started as snow and eventually turned into rain, creating slushy streets and dangerous road conditions for the Tuesday morning commute

What hit: The coastal regions of New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts were hit by less snow than their inland counterparts

Not quite: This person clearly agrees that layers and not bold spring prints are needed in Boston today

The nasty weather led some schools in upstate New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut to close, adding a few more snow days to school calendars.

At Ashburnham True Value Hardware, in north-central Massachusetts, employee Andrew Stanley said he hadn't noticed extra sales of shovels and salt, though the National Weather Service forecast 7 to 19 inches of a mix of snow and sleet. He did hear a little grumbling, though.

Winter wind storm: A tractor trailer hangs off a bridge in Tupelo, Mississippi after high winds caused a crash on Monday

Overturned: Fire fighters examine the crash- where the driver was left unharmed- and try to assess how to proceed

Safety required: A SUV went into a ditch and rolled in Rockefeller Township, Pennsylvania because of the snow

'Everybody's about sick of winter,' he said Monday.

But some were welcoming the forecast, as the coming storm looked to extend the ski season. Just a year ago this week, local temperatures hit the 80s, prompting skiers in Maine to strip down to shorts and bikini tops and forcing an end to the season at many mountains.

When will it end: Towns like Benscreek, Pennsylvania (pictured) were not hit as badly as Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts

Widespread: Winter Storm Ukku is causing trouble across much of the Northern U.S. on Tuesday

Greyed out Gotham: The fog that came from the wintery mix caused bad visibility at the tip of Manhattan, meaning that the full height of the Freedom Tower was not clear to spectators

At Sugarbush Resort in Vermont, communications manager Patrick Brown said more snow now could make spring the best time of year for many.

'Skiers like both of those things: great sunny warm days and lots of snow,' Brown said.

The forecasts called for as much as 20 inches of snow in parts of northern New England, with lesser amounts mixed with sleet further south.

Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, could each get 4-8 inches, and Hartford, Connecticut, 4-8 inches of snow and sleet.

Portland, Maine, could get at least a foot of snow. Montpelier, Vermont, was expecting at least 10 to 18 inches, and Concord, New Hampshire, 7 to 13 inches.

Scary: In the South, the weather threats came in the form of severe wind and lightning, as seen in the sky above in Montgomery, Alabama

Looming: Storms traversed across Lawrence County, Alabama on Monday

Destruction: The McCullar family inspect the damage to their RV in Clay, Alabama on Monday

Those totals could go much higher if the storm continues into Tuesday night.

The likelihood of school cancellations Tuesday led Massachusetts officials to postpone the English composition section of its standardized state test until next Monday, to keep all schools on the same test date. Boston, which kept schools open for the most recent storm, cancelled classes for Tuesday.

After a storm earlier this month dumped over a foot of snow in some areas and caused coastal flooding in Massachusetts, some New Englanders weren't looking forward to more winter weather.

Hail: National Weather Service meteorologist Anna Weber said there were reports of hail the size of softballs in some areas around Jackson

Dangerous: The size of the hail in Mississippi posed as a threat for drivers

In downtown Concord, New Hampshire, Jennifer Hutchins said: 'I hate it ... I guess I like to watch it fall, but I don't like when it sticks around.'

'I'm tired of it,' said Paula Lochhead. 'But we live in New Hampshire, what are you gonna do?'

The South bore the brunt of the storm on Monday, though theirs came in the form of golf ball-sized hail throughout parts of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi.

In Alabama, thunderstorms caused severe rain and wind, damaging several homes.Â
