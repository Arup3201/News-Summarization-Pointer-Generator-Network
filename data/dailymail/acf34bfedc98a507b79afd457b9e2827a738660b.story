Two NHS nurses and a healthcare worker have been sacked for Tweeting about patients and posting embarrassing photographs of themselves while on duty.

In expletive-ridden rants, the nurses and healthcare worker joked on Twitter about patients’ anatomies and toilet habits, and one nurse uploaded an image of herself wearing hospital incontinence pads over her uniform when she was supposed to be working.

Nurse Julie Dyde and healthcare worker Rachel Keys have both been sacked by Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust, West Yorkshire, and nurse Caroline Luxford-Noyes, has been fired by Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, in Kent.

Posing: Caroline Luxford-Noyes posted numerous pictures of herself in her uniform at work, one biting her lip

Luxford-Noyes also took a picture of herself wearing an incontinence pad and posted it on Twitter

The three women joked about being too hungover to work after they had been drinking heavily the night before.

Mrs Keys, 36, who works for Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust, said she was ‘trying not to vomit’ and her colleague Miss Dyde, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, described nearly vomiting while performing CPR on a patient.

Mrs Keys complained about being at a ‘higher risk of dying’ than her patients, to which Miss Dyde replied: ‘It was a toss up between you and bed 6.’

Julie Dyde posted a picture with the comment, 'We're a bit drunk'

Luxford-Noyes posted a posing picture of herself at work last December and one of her chest in October

Miss Luxford-Noyes, from Aylesford, Kent, recommended taking a cocktail of painkillers to overcome the symptoms of a hangover and Miss Dyde boasted about having access to the hospital drugs supply, but added: ‘Harold Shipman ruined it for everyone.’

Mrs Keys and Miss Dyde made a series of insensitive jokes about patients which would have been visible to Mrs Keys’s 7,000 followers.

Miss Dyde, going by the name of 
Wardminion, complained about having to go to work and said: ‘If you live
 in the Halifax/Huddersfield area please try not to have a stroke. Much 
appreciated.’

When 
mother-of-four Mrs Keys had a day off Miss Dyde said: ‘I will be at work
 trying not to strangle people with suction tubing.’

In
 another tweet Miss Dyde, who admits she ‘should have spent longer 
“learning” compassion’, complained about patients using the nurse call 
buzzer, and said: ‘97yo or not, use it again and I will hurt you.’

Miss Dyde 
described one patient as looking like a corpse while Mrs Keys described another 
as ‘sheet white, bog eyed [and] p****d’.

On
 another occasion Miss Dyde and Mrs Keys made light of being unable to 
direct a woman in labour to the maternity ward because they were ‘beyond
 stupid and tripping on NHS coffee and redbull.’

Miss
 Dyde said: ‘Meanwhile very pregnant lady leaks amniotic fluid all over 
the corridor and contemplates giving birth in the car.’

Miss Luxford-Noyes, 42, posted a picture bearing the statement: ‘Nurses...here to save your ass, not kiss it.’

A series of pictures were also posted to Twitter by Miss Luxford-Noyes when she was on duty.

Miss Luxford-Noyes, who described herself as ‘winning at the NHS’, took 15 pictures of herself including one where she appeared to be trying on incontinence pads over her nurse’s uniform.

Miss Luxford-Noyes posted a picture of herself using the toilet and a photograph of her own chest while wearing a protective apron with two holes pierced in it.

A fourth picture uploaded by Miss Luxford-Noyes shows an NHS document entitled ‘Acutely Ill Patients in Hospital’ with the comment: ‘Can someone please read, digest and the explain this to me ASAP.’

Miss Luxford-Noyes, who claims to have worked at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust for 20 years, also posted images of herself posing at work, despite acknowledging her ward was ‘busy’.

After receiving an explicit image from a stranger on the Snapchat app, where users share pictures which delete themselves within seconds, Miss Luxford-Noyes tweeted: ‘Yeah, because as a Nurse I don’t see enough c***! *rolls eyes*’

The three Twitter accounts have since been deleted.

A spokesman for Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, where Miss Luxford-Noyes works, said the trust was 'shocked' to see these tweets, which were described as 'clearly inappropriate, misguided and in breach of our social media policy'.

'We were extremely disappointed with this
 member of staff’s conduct, which fell way below the professional 
standards we expect from our staff.'

Julie Dyde, who admits she 'should have spent longer "learning" compassion', complained about patients using the nurse call buzzer, and said: '97yo or not, use it again and I will hurt you'

Luxford-Noyes said in this picture, left, she was 'rocking the visor look' and posted others of her in uniform

After carrying out it an investigation into her Tweets, the trust fired Miss Luxford-Noyes from her nursing position.

When approached for comment Mrs Keys said: ‘Nothing was inappropriate, I’m disgusted with this. I’m not saying anything.’

Luxford-Noyes posted various photos to her Twitter account, taken at work, including this one, inviting someone to 'lick it'

Owen Williams, chief executive of Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust,  described the Tweets of Julie Dyde and Rachel Keys as 'deeply unprofessional'.

'Two members of staff were excluded pending a thorough investigation as soon as the content of the tweets was brought to our notice,' he said.

'Following the investigations there were disciplinary hearings within the Trust’s disciplinary procedure and both employees were dismissed.'

He underlined the high quality of care being provided by a team of 50 doctors, nurses and therapists on the stroke unit.

Miss Luxford-Noyes and Miss Dyde could not be contacted for comment.
