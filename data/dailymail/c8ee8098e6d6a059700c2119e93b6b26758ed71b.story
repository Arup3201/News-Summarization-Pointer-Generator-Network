A senior executive at Uber made a grovelling apology after suggesting a plan to spend $1million on a team of researchers to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize his company.

Emil Michael, who made the remarks at a private dinner in Manhattan, said he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers' personal lives and families so that Uber could discredit them.

The sinister scheme was targeted at a particular Silicon Valley female editor who has savaged the company for its alleged 'sexism and misogyny' - but drew an outraged backlash when it became public.

Shocking: Emil Michael (pictured), Uber's senior vice president, reportedly proposed looking into journalists' 'personal lives' and 'families' while in the presence of a BuzzFeed editor at a private dinner in  New York

A chorus of disapproval aimed at Michael prompted a humiliating public apology to Sarah Lacy, the editor of PandoDaily, in which he disowned the idea entirely.

Michael posted an apology to Lacy's Twitter account, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly. My comments were wrong and I deeply regret them.

'Neither me [sic] nor my company would ever engage in such activities. Again, I apologize.' 

The remarks will do little to improve Uber's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints.

And, indeed, the apology did not stop Lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece on PandoDaily, in which she said the plan was 'like a five-year-old pretending to be Frank Underwood' - a reference to Kevin Spacey's scheming politician character in Netflix series House of Cards.

According to Lacy, Michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private, but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation. 

The dinner party in question was hosted by Ian Osborne, ex-adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron and consultant for Uber

Michael's plan came up when he was asked about the firm's negative press coverage.

In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, according to BuzzFeed.

The eight-strong hit team would investigate 'your personal lives, your families' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service, he said.

Michael was especially focused on Lacy, who also recently accused Uber of 'sexism and misogyny' on her Silicon Valley website, writing: 'The company simply doesn’t respect us or prioritize our safety.'

He reportedly expressed anger over her claims that, responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than Uber drivers.

He said Lacy should be held 'personally responsible' for any women who copy her and delete the taxi app, and are then sexually assaulted, it is reported

Venue: During the dinner party at Manhattan's Waverly Inn (pictured), Michael was reportedly asked about the firm's depictions in the press. In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, it is claimed

Apology: Michael, who used to work at Klout and also sits on a board advising the Department of Defense, later took to Twitter to apologize for his comments to Lacy herself, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly'

Contradicting his remarks: He added: 'Neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities'

And in reference to a specific claim about Lacy's personal life, he said Uber's dirt-diggers could work covertly to expose and discredit her to others, adding: 'Nobody would know it was us.'

After being confronted about his comments, Michael, who has been at Uber for more than a year and was previously described as a 'top deal guy' by founder Travis Kalanick, later apologized

In a statement to BuzzFeed on Monday evening, he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his nor Uber's views.

'The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company’s views or approach,' he said.

'They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.'  

At no point during the dinner did Michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers.

An Uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a 'clear violation of our privacy and data access policies'.

The event at Waverly Inn on Friday evening was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including actor Ed Norton and publisher Arianna Huffington.

Response: On Monday, Ms Lacy responded to BuzzFeed's article on her site (pictured), saying: 'Companies shouldn’t be allowed to go to illegal lengths to defame and silence reporters'

It comes as a legal battle between Nevada's highly regulated taxi industry and Uber stumbled into complications as two state judges laid claim to hearing the same case.

In court on Monday, Clark County District Judge Douglas Herndon blamed the overlap on the state attorney general, who represents the Nevada Taxicab Authority and Nevada Transportation Authority.

'I think you're jumping around to different jurisdictions trying to get a ruling,' he said. 

The state regulators want to put an end to Uber, which launched its ride-sharing services in Las Vegas, Reno and Carson City on October 24.

Hours after the service was launched, the state hastily sought orders to halt the company's business in all three cities. The attorney general later filed a complaint and motions in Washoe County.

On Monday, Uber asked the state Supreme Court to put a halt to the  case.

The company expects a decision in several days.
