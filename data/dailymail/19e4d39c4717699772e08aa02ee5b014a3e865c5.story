Yemen's embattled president has fled the country by sea after Houthi rebels advanced on the southern port city where he was taking refuge, captured his defence minister and seized the airport.

Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi was initially smuggled out of Aden just hours after the Shiite rebels' own TV station declared the capture of nearby strategic airbase and arrested the country's defence minister.

The air base is only 35 miles from Aden, where Hadi had established a temporary capital since fleeing Yemen's Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa last month.

U.S. and European troops were also based there while advising the government on how to tackle Al Qaeda militants in the country.

Just hours after Hadi fled, the rebels who offered a $100,000 bounty for his capture carried out a wave of airstrikes targeting the presidential security forces guarding the palace.

The advance of the Shiite rebels, empowered by the backing of the ousted Yemeni autocrat Ali Abdullah Saleh and his loyalists, threatens to plunge the Arab world's poorest country into a civil war that could draw in its Gulf neighbors. 

Already, Hadi has asked the UN to authorize a foreign military intervention in the country.

The takeover of Aden, the country's economic hub, would mark the collapse of what is left of Hadi's grip on power. It would also open a new chapter in the Houthi-Saleh alliance and possibly pave the way for more infighting.

Aden was tense this morning, with schools, government offices, shops and restaurants largely closed. Inside the few remaining opened cafes, men watched news of the assault on television.

Since the morning, there were conflicting reports on Hadi's whereabouts. 

Witnesses said they saw a convoy of presidential vehicles leaving Hadi's palace on top of a hill overlooking the Arabian Sea. A second convoy was seen heading to the Aden airport, where flights have been halted amid the Houthi advance.

Military officials said militias and military units loyal to Hadi had 'fragmented,' speeding the rebel advance. They said the rebels were fighting Hadi's troops on five different fronts Wednesday.

Presidential officials insist Hadi is in an operations room overseeing his forces' response. They declined to say where that facility was located. 

All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.

Yemen's state TV, now controlled by the Houthis, this morning made an offer of nearly $100,000 for Hadi's capture.

That announcement came after Defense Minister Major General Mahmoud al-Subaihi and his top aides were arrested in the southern city of Lahj - where fighting with Houthi forces is ongoing - and were subsequently transferred to Sanaa.

Later, the rebels and Saleh's loyalists carried out three airstrikes targeting the Aden palace presidential compound and Hadi's forces positioned there, officials said. 

No casualties were reported in the strikes, similar to ones carried out last week.

Speaking this morning, Yemen's Foreign Minister Riad Yassin told Dubai-based Al-Arabiya TV satellite news network that he officially made a request to the Arab League to send a military force to intervene against the Houthis. 

Yassin will be attending the Arab Summit due to take place in Egypt at the end of the week.

The airstrikes were an attempt to 'assassinate' Hadi, Yassin said in another interview with the Doha-based Al-Jazeera TV network.

Depicting the Houthis as a proxy of Shiite Iran, a rival to Sunni Gulf countries, Yassin warned of an Iranian 'takeover' of Yemen. The Houthis deny they are backed by Iran.

Mohammed Abdel-Salam, a spokesman for the Houthis, said their forces were not aiming to 'occupy' the south. 'They will be in Aden in few hours,' Abdel-Salam told the rebels' satellite Al-Masirah news channel.

Earlier, Al-Masirah reported that the Houthis and allied fighters had 'secured' the al-Annad air base, the country's largest. 

It claimed the base had been looted by both Al Qaeda fighters and troops loyal to Hadi.

The reported Houthi takeover of the base came after hours-long clashes between rival forces around the base. 

The U.S. recently evacuated some 100 soldiers, including Special Forces commandos, from the base after Al Qaeda briefly seized a nearby city. Britain also evacuated soldiers.

The base was crucial in the U.S. drone campaign against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which Washington considers to be the most dangerous offshoot of the terror group. 

And American and European military advisers there also assisted Hadi's government in its fight against Al Qaeda's branch, which holds territory in eastern Yemen and has claimed the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris.

U.S. operations against the militants have been scaled back dramatically amid Yemen's chaos. 

U.S. officials have said CIA drone strikes will continue in the country, though there will be fewer of them. The agency's ability to collect intelligence on the ground in Yemen, while not completely gone, is also much diminished.

The Houthis, in the aftermath of massive suicide bombings in Sanaa last week that killed at least 137 people, ordered a general mobilization and their leader, Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, vowed to send his forces to the south to fight al-Qaida and militant groups.

The Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa, in September and have since been advancing south alongside forces loyal to Saleh.

Yesterday Houthis and their allies fired bullets and tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters in the city of Taiz, known as the gateway to southern Yemen. 

Six demonstrators were killed and scores more were wounded, officials said.

The Houthis also battled militias loyal to Hadi in the city of al-Dhalea adjacent to Taiz. 

Al-Dhalea, Yemen's third-largest city, is also the birthplace of its 2011 Arab Spring-inspired uprising that forced Saleh to hand over power to Hadi in a deal brokered by the U.N. and Gulf countries.

To make matters in Yemen even more complicated, militants loyal to the Islamic State announced the formation of a cell in the country after claiming responsibility for last week's massive multi-suicide bomber attack that left hundreds killed or injured in the capital Sanaa

To make matters in Yemen even more complicated, militants loyal to the Islamic State announced the formation of a cell in the country after claiming responsibility for last week's massive multi-suicide bomber attack that left hundreds killed or injured in the capital Sanaa.

Four bombers wearing explosive belts targeted the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques in  Sanaa during midday prayers in what was one of the country's deadliest ever jihadist attacks.

At least 137 are dead and a further 351 people are thought to have been wounded in the devastating blasts, described by eyewitnesses as being like earthquakes.

A group claiming to be the Yemeni branch of ISIS immediately said they were responsible for the bombings and released images of their logo as a way of declaring the formation of the cell.

Charred bodies and pools of blood were seen at the scene of the explosions while footage from the al-Hashoosh mosque, showed screaming volunteers using bloodied blankets to carry away victims. 

The mosques are mainly used by supporters of the Shi'ite Muslim Houthi group as well as Sunni worshippers.
