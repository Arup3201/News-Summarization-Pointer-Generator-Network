Welcome to Columbia. A beautiful city nestled in the clouds. Where the sun’s constantly shining and its inhabitants live a life of bliss.

Rapture, this isn't. But for those yearning for the damp, claustrophobic atmosphere that made the last two games such hits, it's not long before Columbia reveals its sinister underbelly.

Sky's the limit: You'll often just want to stand and stare at the stunning views. But most of the time, you'll die very quickly if you do.

Set in 1912 during a period of American Exceptionalism, you play former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt who's on a rescue mission to save a lady called Elizabeth.

Upon finding himself in Columbia (after one of the game's splendid in-game cutscenes) he's soon harried and chased by the dystopia's warring factions - the nativist Founders and the Vox Populi.

He's also on the run from the Songbird - a menacing flying robot who's been Elizabeth's guardian for the 12 years that she's been imprisoned.

Immediately noticeable are the graphics - which are based on the Unreal 3 Engine - almost unrecognisable given the amount of customisation Irrational Games have done.

Beauty and the beast: Elizabeth has been kept captive for 12 years, and is guarded by a huge metal beast called the Songbird.

Buildings stand tall, proudly displaying their Venetian-esque splendour. Intricately-laid cobbled roads are frequently interrupted with extravagant water fountains. There is no doubt that the sun-kissed world of Columbia is a graphical masterpiece.

Gameplay, however, stills feels very much like a Bioshock game - albeit with a few tweaks. 

Guns are used by the right trigger, while powers and mutations, the left. Mutations available in the preview were a fireball - which engulfed foes and reduced them to charred embers, birds that could be released to tear people apart, and Possession - which can be used to turn enemies against each other.

Similar to the Adam and Eve in the previous games - DeWitt can collect Salts, which - when he has enough - can be used to trigger the mutations.

This will come in handy: This claw-like weapon can be used to traverse the city's sky lines, however, it also acts as brutal melee weapon.

There are also plenty of man-made weapons, ranging from the trusty pistol to the high-velocity machine gun. But it's a claw-like melee device that is perhaps the most useful.

This allows you traverse the city's skylines - and being magnetic - lets you perform death-defying leaps. Indeed, this is much more vertically-layered than its predecessors - levels clearly designed to encourage gamers to explore and experiment.

The claw is also a brutally powerful 
melee weapon - a press of the button sees DeWitt jam it into an enemy's 
skull one minute, or cleanly decapitate them the next.

Sometimes, you'll walk into areas designed to give you optional battles. For example, you may decide to gun down a load of NPCs, which will alert guards to your position. If, instead, you leave them be, the nearby guards will be none-the-wiser to your location and you'll avoid a firefight.

It's a bold move changing a winning formula, but Bioshock Infinite may be one of the rare examples where the risk pays off.

It's released on March 26.
