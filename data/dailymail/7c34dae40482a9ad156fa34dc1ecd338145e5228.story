Boris Johnson is a bit of a tw**, I can't decide between David Cameron and George Osborne, and I don't know the exact size of UK national debt.

These were just a few facts revealed by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg as he was grilled on Channel 4 comedy show The Last Leg tonight.

According to Mr Clegg he has also though about slapping David Cameron 'more than 20 times' during this parliament, and wants to avoid Nigel Farage 'at all costs'.

Nick Clegg was subjected to an awkward grilling on Channel 4 comedy show The Last Leg tonight. When asked 'Boris Johnson, statesman or twat?' he responded, 'bit more of the latter'

Mr Clegg agreed to appear to convince host Alex Brooke (left) to vote, but was instead asked a host of personal questions. When given a choice between David Cameron and George Osborne he refused to answer

Mr Clegg was asked to appear on the comedy show under the pretense of convincing one of the panelists, Alex Brooker, to vote at the next election.

But instead he was subjected to a master-mind style grilling on everything from his relationship with the opposition to the debt crisis in Greece.

Asked to give the size of the UK debt to the nearest hundred, Mr Clegg was left floundering, instead saying it was 'around five per cent'.

When guessing the size of the Greek national debt he did little better, under-estimating the number by some £100billion.

When asked whether he liked David Cameron or George Osborne best he refused to answer, saying 'David Osborne' and 'George Cameron' before waiting until host Alex Brooker moved on to the next question.

And to the question 'Boris Johnson, statesman or tw**?' he replied: 'More of the latter.' 

When Mr Clegg was given 30 seconds to speak about voting, the Lib Dem leader used one of Mr Brooker's favourite restaurants - Nando's - as an example.

Asked about the size of UK debt  he was left floundering before answering 'about five per cent'. He also showed remorse over his decision to hike tuition fees which saw his party slump in the polls

Response to Mr Clegg's appearance on Twitter was mixed, with some branding him a 'comedy' figure, while others said the performance had been 'brave'

In remarks that helped win over his audience he said: 'If you go into Nando's and you don't order, then you can't complain about what you're given.

'If you don't vote then you won't get the kind of government you want, so you should vote.' 

Mr Clegg also revealed he is kept up at night over his decision to increase student debt, another remark which impressed those watching.

However he also continued to defend the decision, adding: 'I'm not Prime Minister so I can't do what I want.'

The Lib Dems poll ratings have never recovered from the decision to increase fees months after the coalition was formed in 2010. 

With just 100 days to go until the election the party is facing losing almost half of its seats in the next parliament, according to pollsters.

Mr Clegg's election strategists will be hoping that his appearance in front of 1.6million viewers will help to claw back some ground.

On Twitter reaction to his appearance was mixed, with some slating him as a 'comedy figure', while others said he came across as brave. 

The Deputy Prime Minister also took part in a gag at the end where he threw a melon at Mr Brooker who attempted to kick it with a blade attached to his foot

One user calling himself 'Craig' wrote: 'It's ironic that Nick Clegg is on The Last Leg tonight - as he's pretty much on his last leg in the government!'

While another man going by the handle 'East Londoner' added: 'Nick Clegg has got some balls going on The Last Leg tonight. Shame he couldn't show this bravery in, you know, Parliament...'

However some people also praised the Deputy Prime Minister. Neil Burnett ‏said: 'Fair play to Clegg going on The Last Leg, good sport.  Should happen more often.'

Lee Allen commented: 'People give Nick Clegg grief, but fair play to him that was a good interview & Nando's bit made sense.'

Mr Clegg also managed to have a dig at David Cameron over the upcoming televisied debates.

At the end of the interview he was asked who he would like to nominate to come on the programme next, replying instantly 'David Cameron'.

But he added: 'He won't come alone, though. He'll bring the Green Party, the Monster Raving Loony, Larry the Cat, everybody.'
