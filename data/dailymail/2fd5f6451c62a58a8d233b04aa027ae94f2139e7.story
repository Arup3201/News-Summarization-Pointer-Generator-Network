It was the moment that America's most controversial and outspoken right- wing voice found himself surrounded by New York's liberal elite.

Glenn Beck, 47, fought back tears after a 'public lynching' he suffered with his wife and daughter at an outdoor film when cinemagoers turned on him.

But what really happened is still under question, with one witness today claiming it was blown out of proportion and his 
family was left alone.

Family time: Glenn Beck (centre) snapped on Monday in Bryant Park during its Summer Film Festival, which he attended with wife Tania and daughter Hannah

Public insults: Beck said a nearby moviegoer kicked wine on his wife Tania (centre left) shortly after they arrived

The outspoken presenter, whose radio show was streamed on internet channel GBTV, said he was with his wife, Tania, and daughter Hannah.

They were watching Alfred Hitchcock’s The 39 
Steps at Bryant Park's Summer Film Festival, where hundreds of moviegoers lay out 
for shows. 

But his security detail was forced to intervene when nearby patrons made a pronounced effort to show he was unwelcome.

Mr Beck claimed 'hateful' people kicked wine on his wife and hurled insults.

However Lindsey Piscitell, 25, contacted a magazine to say 
she was sat with several friends behind Mr Beck and disputed his version of events.

She said his family was left 'completely alone, and for the most part he
was too' - adding that the wine glass incident was 'a complete
accident'.

But a Twitter account under her name said: 'F*****g #a*****e @glenbeck is siting next to me at Bryant park movie night #getthef**koutofmycity'.

Another comment made under her user name on a blog, according to The Blaze, said: 'We were very civilized, apologised for the incident, and gave them some napkins. we were of course VERY happy that it happened'.

Mr Beck recalled: 'We got there about 7:00. And it was a
hostile situation. Somebody kicked a cup of wine 
intentionally onto my wife's back.

'As
my daughter and my wife went to go and use the restroom... on the other
end of the park, some guy stood up and and pointed his fingers at them 
and said: "We hate conservatives here!"'

'I was told a lot last night how much New York hates people like me... These people were some of the most hateful people I have ever seen'

'I was told a lot last night how much New York hates people like me,' he said, comparing the scene to a public lynching.

'I swear to you I think, if I had 
suggested, and I almost did, "Wow, does anybody have a rope? Because 
there’s tree here.

'You could just lynch me." And I think there would 
have been a couple in the crowd that would have.'

Mr Beck said his security team was worried the incident could have easily spun out of control, had he not kept calm.

'My security detail was talking this morning that had we reacted poorly the whole thing could have just gone up,' he said.

Divisive: Beck said, 'I was told a lot last night how much New York hates people like me'

'These people were some of the most 
hateful people I have ever seen,' he said.

'You can take pictures of me and make me into a monster; say whatever you want but please leave my family out of it'

'All I wanted to do was go 
out on a blanket with my family and have dinner in the afternoon sun and
sit around.'

He refused to leave despite the public taunts, but made a swift exit just 
before the credits rolled, prompting the crowd to break out in applause.

'When the movie was just 
about over my wife and I got out because it was hussle,' he said.

'We 
didn't leave... because I have a right to watch a movie and enjoy a 
movie with my family in the park.'

But he was most distraught by the public taunts directed as his daughter and wife.

'People were taking pictures of my family,' he said of images that later circulated online.

'His family was left completely alone, and for the most part he was too'

'You can take pictures of me and make me into a monster; say whatever you want but please leave my family out of it,' he said.

Ms Piscitell contacted New York Magazine to say his family was left 'completely alone, and for the most part he
was too' - adding that the wine glass spilling incident was 'a complete
accident'.

She told New York Magazine: 'It was his security detail that seemed to
be unnecessarily prickly with the crowd, scolding myself and my friends
for acrobatics and other harmless activities taking place.'

A Bryant Park spokesman told AM New York he heard of no incident report filed regarding Mr Beck and the 20-year-old event is 'usually civil'.

Mr Beck is due to host his last show on Fox News on Thursday afternoon.
