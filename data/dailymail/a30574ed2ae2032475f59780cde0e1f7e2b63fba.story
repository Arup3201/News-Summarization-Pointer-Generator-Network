A 14-year-old girl found murdered and dumped in a drainage ditch in Michigan last week sent a frantic text to her boyfriend around the same time she was killed saying: 'Omg. … I think I’m being kidnapped.'

Murdered: April Millsap, 14, was found murdered in a drainage ditch in Armada, Michigan, on July 24

Police do not know who whether the text was actually sent by the victim, April Millsap, whose body was found by joggers last Thursday off the popular Macomb Orchard Trail in Armada, some 35 miles northeast of Detroit.

No arrests have been made, but a sketch of the male suspect has been released.

Investigators say they are looking for a man in his 20s with medium-length curly hair.

The man had been seen in the area where April was murdered, according to The New York Daily News.

She was walking her dog, Penny, who was guarding her body and barked at the passers-by who inevitably found April.

April generally walked her dog on the trail every night.

Police have not released how April died, but have confirmed she was not shot or stabbed.

Around 600 tips about the case have been reported.

'There's no such thing as a tip that's not worthwhile,' Armada police Chief Howard Smith said at a Sunday news conference.

'We're especially interested in any information from anyone who was on the trail between 6.20pm and 8.20 pm.'

Tragic: The small town of Armada has been overcome with sadness following the murder of April Millsap

'Even the smallest bit of information could be helpful.'

The terrifying text message is one of the biggest clues.

'We don’t know who sent it — if it was April, if it was the killer, or someone else,' Michigan State Police Lt. Michael Shaw told the Free Press.

Police also said they are looking for a grey van 'painter’s-type' box van with dents all over it that was spotted in the area.

Two men were said to be inside it.

The van, coupled with the text, gives the impression April was being followed.

April's heartbroken mother, Jennifer Millsap, hopes the killer will be brought to justice.

“I’m just existing. I’m just numb,” the girl’s mother, 43-year-old Jennifer Millsap, told the Detroit Free Press on Monday.

Armada is a rural town with less than 2,000 residents.

The tight-knit community has been completely overcome with sadness following the murder.

'Yesterday it was disbelief,' Armada Schools superintendent Michael Musary told Click On Detroit.

'Today it's reality. Our hearts are broken.'

April's school, Armada Middle School, opened early Saturday morning for grief counseling.

The first people to arrive were April's boyfriend, Austin, and his parents.

The people have been left questioning whether April knew her attacker.

'That's what we think,' said Dennis Levans, April's grandfather.

'This is what we think. It's almost like it had to be something like somebody knew them.

'We can't think of any other reason. We can't come up with any other logical reason.'

There will be a prayer service at St. Mary in Armada at 6.30 p.m. on Saturday, click On Detroit reported.
