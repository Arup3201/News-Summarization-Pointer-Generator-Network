Katherine Martinez, 23, was attacked by a smitten admirer after revealing she was pregnant with her boyfriend's baby

A smitten man who tried unsuccessfully for two years to woo a 23-year-old college student stabbed and strangled her to death when he learned that she was pregnant - and that he wasn't the father.

Katherine Martinez repeatedly rebuffed Emilio Calderon's romantic advances - even after he started giving her rides to work and class and offered to buy her a car, her family says. 

The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports that Calderon, 29, admitted to becoming enraged when he visited Martinez Sunday at her apartment in Terrytown, Louisiana. 

Police say he stabbed her three times and then strangled her to death. Her unborn baby died, as well.

Martinez's
 family says he should have had no expectation that the baby was his - 
she never liked him as anything more than a friend.

'They never had sex. They didn't kiss. They never even held hands,' Osmer Batrez, Martinez's friend, told the newspaper.

'They did not have an intimate relationship.'

Despite
 Martinez's insistence that she and Calderon remain 'just friends,' he 
became more persistent. Eventually, he started showing up at Blue Cliff 
College, where she took classes, and the restaurant where she worked as a
 waitress.

Martinez
 started blocking him on her social media accounts. Calderon responded 
by creating fake usernames to trick Martinez into 'friending' him so he 
could keep tabs on her, her family told the Times-Picayune.

Despite Calderon's persistence, he never exhibited violence or aggressiveness, they say. 

When
 Martinez got a serious boyfriend, Calderon became even more interested 
in her, Martinez's mother Orla Martinez told the newspaper.

He attempted to swoop in when they had relationship problems. Still, Martinez rebuffed him.

On Sunday, she let him into her apartment so they could talk, police said.

At
 some point, after learning she was pregnant with her boyfriend's child,
 Calderon flew into a rage and attacked her, police say.

'We want the public to know that just because he pursued her, doesn't mean he was entitled to her,' Martinez's friend Onix Palacios told the Times-Picayne.

'She was a good daughter, a good sister, a good friend. She didn't deserve this coward taking her life when she had dreams and goals to be a wonderful mother.'
