These beautiful photos of the sky were created by stacking images of the same scene together using a time-lapse method. Photographer Matt Molloy snapped a range of scenes including sunsets and bright skies in at midday.

Mr Molloy, of Ontario, Canada, said: 'Sunsets seem to work well, as the lighting constantly gets darker. A midday time-lapse can get messy, but they can be fun too.'  He added: 'I'm a big fan of experimenting. Much like this process, you never know what you’re going to get.'

Mr Molloy said one of the pictures was put together using hundreds of photos, and that he had used the same technique of overlapped multiple exposure in the past for star trails.
