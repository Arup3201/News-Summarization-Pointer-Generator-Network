Bees are dropping like flies in Colorado, with some pollinators seen dying in midflight, scaring some homeowners into getting rid of pesticides on their properties.

Residents in north Boulder, located 30 miles northwest of Denver, are growing accustomed to the the sight of honey bee corpses littering their properties.

'I sweep them up in the morning. I sweep them up again if I’m here midday. And I sweep them again at night,' resident Kit VanWinkle told CBS Denver.

Bee horror: Honeybees are dropping dead in Boulder, Colorado, and residents worry that pesticides used on their lawns are to blame

Yellow lawn flags became a mark of death, neighbors say.

VanWinkle says she began seeing small flags warning residents that an area is sprayed with pesticide at the same time she noticed bees were dying.

Throughout the United States, honeybees and other pollinators are dying in large numbers, a phenomenon known as colony collapse.

The
 cause of the deaths was a mystery for years, but scientists now believe
 that a type of pesticide known as 'neonicotinoids' is the prime 
suspect, according to The Washington Post.

Residents in one Colorado community decided they'd had enough with toxic lawn care and created the first Bee Safe neighborhood.

Around 75 homeowners banded together, pledging not to use pesticides on their properties.

One bee-friendly homeowner, David Wheeler, knows what is at stake in a world without bees.

'Bees are pollinators,' he explained. 'Without them you wouldn’t be eating almonds, oranges, apples, squash, tomatoes, anything that has a flower.'

Residents are now calling for the state's pesticide control board to weigh in on the issue.
