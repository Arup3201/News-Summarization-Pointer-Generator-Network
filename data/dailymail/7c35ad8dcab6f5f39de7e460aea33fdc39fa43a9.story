Given the number of victims, it seems likely there were multiple shooters. 

Four adults - two males and two females - were shot and sustained 'serious, but non-life threatening gunshot wounds'. A fifth person was physically assaulted.

Two of the gunshot victims were from one group and two were from the other. 

They were taken to area hospitals for treatment and all are expected to survived their injuries.

It is unknown which group the beating victim belonged to. The fifth subject was initially in critical condition but is now stable.  

Alcohol was 'definitely involved,' according to the Sacramento Bee.

In an email to MailOnline, a Sacramento Police Department public information officer wrote: 'This is a very active investigation and detectives are still currently working to determine a specific motive.' 

Gang detectives and a CSI team were called to 'assist with documenting the scene and the collection of evidence'.

Felony assault detectives were also enlisted to help with the investigation.

Police have advised people to avoid the area in North Sacramento where the shooting occurred last night 

Officers thought they had a suspect cornered in a home near the scene of the shootings and considered calling in a SWAT team, KCRA reported. 

A search of the home reveled there was no one inside.

No arrests were made and the investigation is ongoing.
