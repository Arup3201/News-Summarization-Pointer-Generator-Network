A baby pygmy goat was beheaded and another goat was taken from the New Orleans park where they had been penned up, the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said Thursday.

The SPCA is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction in the death of Jack, a black-and-white pygmy goat, and the disappearance of his brother, a goat named Calvin. Both were born Nov. 6.

'It could have been a dog or coyote. It looks bad but I'd prefer to think that something like that happened,' said Morgana King, owner of 'Y'Herd Me?' which contracts out its goats to eat unwanted vegetation such as weeds, and to trim grass.

She acknowledged, however, that the wound looked like a cut rather than a bite.

The dead goat's head was missing but its body was found Thursday at Brechtel Park on New Orleans' west bank.

Four goats, including another kid born in September, had been penned there, according to the business website.

King's husband, Michael King, told investigators the culprits might be teenagers he argued with because they were trying to 'mess with the goats' during the weekend, SPCA spokeswoman Alicia Haefele said.

However, Morgana King said she believes that scenario was unlikely.

'He (Michael King) also believes that it was possibly an animal attack but our humane officers don't feel the wound marks on the neck support that scenario,' Haefele wrote in an email.
