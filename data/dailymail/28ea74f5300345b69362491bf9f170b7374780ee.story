With only thin justifications, NSA agents have been spying on Americans online without a warrant- reading emails, chats and browsing histories.

Today, The Guardian broke down the process by which NSA analysts tap internet activity by publishing a training guide used to introduce new
analysts to X-Keyscore.

Described as the 'widest-ranging' database, X-Keyscore allows analysts to wiretap basically anyone.

Snowden was referring to the system when he said in June: ‘I,
sitting at my desk can wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a
federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email.’

How they did it: New documents published in The Guardian today show how NSA analysts like Edward Snowden spied on Americans without a warrant

Massive reach: X-KEYSCORE is a program involving over 700 servers worldwide that supposedly hold basically everything that every casual user does on the internet

The manual explained in detail how analysts could side-step
warrants and spy on ‘nearly everything a typical user does on the internet’ –
including the web activity of Americans.

These revelations come in light of a congressional hearing
taking place today which Representative Alan Grayson said would be ‘an ad hoc,
bipartisan hearing on domestic surveillance.’

Senior intelligence officials from the Department of Justice, NSA, Office of National Intelligence, and the FBI, as
well as critics, will be speaking about the surveillance program.

Hearing: The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing today on the surveillance programs carried out by the NSA

Legally, the NSA is not allowed to spy on U.S. persons
without a Fisa warrant. But X-Keyscore provides a loophole for this law.

If an American had contact with a foreign target, that allows
the NSA to track them without a warrant.

Analysts just provide a justification for the tapping,
usually from several excuses, some included in a drop-drown menu, and they can start
surveillance.

No court official or NSA official signed off on the
individual justifications. 

'It's very rare to be questioned on our searches,’ Snowden
said in June. ‘and even when we are it's usually along the lines of: let's bulk
up the justification'

The NSA denies this claim, issuing a statement to the
newspaper today that there are ‘multiple technical, manual and supervisory
checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from
occurring.’

And once tapped, the type of information searchable is startling. All they need is simple information such as an email, IP address or
phone number to access web activity. 

Manual: An excerpt from the X-Keyscore training guide shows how simple log-in information allows analysts to access a wide-range of information online

By entering a person’s email and a justification, an analyst
can read all email exchanges, narrowing down by time range.

Justification: Analysts can read personal email exchanges with an address and a simple 'justification' for the surveillance

Analysts
could also read chats and private message on social-networking site Facebook simply by entering the target’s
username and a date range.

They could perform reverse searches as well, entering a specific
website and gaining information on all the IP addresses that visited it.

The sheer amount of information being collected online is so large
that most information can only be stored for three to five days.

To store ‘interesting data’  for longer, the agency built a database that
can hold some documents for as long as five years.

According to an NSA report published in 2007, 850billion ‘call
events’ had been collected and stored, and about 150billion internet records.
They reported that each day 1-2billion new records were added.

In 2012, there were 41billion total records in the
X-Keyscore system for one 30-day period.

While the agency has tried to keep U.S. communications separate
from foreign communications, they have admitted that even
strictly U.S. communications can travel on foreign systems and it’s sometimes
hard to identify the national origin of of a communication. 

Domestic surveillance: Drop-down menus give analysts several justifications to monitor Americans based on a foreign target connection

In their statement, the NSA continued to defend their broad
surveillance: ‘These types of programs allow us to collect the information that
enables us to perform our missions successfully – to defend the nation and to
protect U.S. and allied troops abroad.’

Wide-ranging: X-Keyscore allowed analysts access to 'nearly everything a typical user does on the internet'

Hoping to stop some 
of the opposition in congress to domestic surveillance, the Obama 
administration announced today that it will declassify a set of documents on its telephone 
spying program.

The
documents will provide little solace, however, to Americans hoping to 
understand the legal analysis that underpinned the widespread 
surveillance.

And the redacted documents show only in broad strokes how NSA officials use the data.

One particular type of analysis, called "hop analysis" is hinted at but never fully discussed. That allows the government to search the phone records of not only suspected terrorists, but everyone who called them, everyone who called those people, and others who called them, as well.

With that authority, the government can search the records of millions of people in an investigation of one person.
