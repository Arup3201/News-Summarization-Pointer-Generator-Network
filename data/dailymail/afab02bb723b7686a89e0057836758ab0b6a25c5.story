Hopping across the backs of clowns, ball spinning and clambering along moving poles, these adventurous cats certainly know how to put on a unique show.

Some 120 felines make up the Moscow Cat Theatre, which has reopened after a year of renovation and features madcap acts with titles such as Catnappers, Cat Clowns and Cats from the Universe.

The Russian theatre, which was founded by Yuri Kuklachev and his son Dmitri in 1990, includes stunts that see cats walk a tightrope, wobble on a rocking horse and pose on top of a mirror ball.

Shows: The theatre, which was founded by Yuri Kuklachev and his son Dmitri in 1990, includes various stunts

The cat theatre reopened last Friday and hundreds of locals were there to see the first performance.

Dimitri Kuklachev, artistic director of the cat theatre, said: 'The animals feel good and each of them has found its place. That's great because it shows that the atmosphere here is favourable for them.'

He told New Tang Dynasty Television: ‘We have more than 120 cats in total. We haven't brought all of them here. Step by step we will be bringing them in. Soon we'll have a whole cats world here.’

Mr Kuklachev’s father Yuri, who is a 
legendary animal trainer and clown, runs the theatre - which bills 
itself as ‘the only cat theatre in the world'.

He was seen in last Friday’s performance 
on stage dancing with the cats and guiding them through stunts 
choreographed to music, reported New Tang Dynasty Television.

Audiences can also see felines before and after shows in the theatre’s glass ‘cat temple’.

However, Yuri Kuklachev has drawn criticism over his theatre from U.S. animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

A PETA spokesman told MailOnline it was worried about cats ‘forced to carry out uncomfortable and unnatural tricks, such as performing with burning torches and dragging a doll's pram’.

He claimed: ‘Mindful members of the audience quickly realise that the cats' performances are driven by fear and enforcement and are neither voluntary nor enjoyable for the animals.’

The theatre went to Germany, and 'after examining the show, PETA Germany urged authorities to ban the performance and encouraged prospective audience members not to buy tickets', he said.
