The man accused of murdering Morgan Huxley says he had a consensual sexual encounter with him before an intruder hit him over the head, knocking him sideways.

Daniel Jack Kelsall, who has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Mr Huxley to death on September 8, 2013, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday he was invited to his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore. 

The 22-year-old says he struck up a conversation with Mr Huxley while walking home in the early hours of the morning.

Daniel Jack Kelsall, who has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Morgan Huxley to death on September 8, 2013, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday

He said Mr Huxley was smiling during the friendly chat but became more serious as he started talking about how he had had a 'stressful week'. 

'He said he had some problems with work,' Kelsall said. 'I said something like, "Do you want to talk about it?".

'He seemed a little hesitant about it and then he said, "Yeah, I could do with someone to talk to".' 

Mr Huxley then invited him to his apartment, Kelsall told the jury.

After talking for a while about Mr Huxley's work, which 'wasn't going so well', Kelsall said he asked the 31-year-old "Do you want to do things with me?"

The pair then went upstairs to Mr Huxley's room.

'He (Mr Huxley) came in after me and turned off the lights and he immediately dropped his pants.'

With his shoes still on, Kelsall said Mr Huxley lay down on his bed. Kelsall told the court he sat between Mr Huxley's legs and began fondling his penis.

'Then something hit me in the side of the head. It really hurt,' Kelsall said.

Mark Kelsall gave evidence last week at the trial of his son Daniel who is accused of killing Morgan Huxley in 2013 in the victim's Sydney apartment

Paramedics Mark Lenehan and David Rigby, who were the first responders to the home of murder victim Morgan Huxley, were pictured arriving at the NSW Supreme Court last week

'I kind of looked up and there was another person in the room. I got up and ran.

'I knew there was at least one (person there). It could have been more.' 

He told the court he didn't tell police because he was afraid of having anything to do with the murder.

'I want to make amends and tell the truth for a terrible lie I have told and I want them (the jury) to understand my side of the story,' Kelsall said.

The trial continues.
