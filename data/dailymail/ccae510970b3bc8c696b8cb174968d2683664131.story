A surf photographer who went on a quest to find a Great White Shark spotted two swimming in the water - just 25 yards from the shore of a popular surfing beach.

Gus McConnell managed to catch the moment on camera as the 6ft shark casually swam among boarders, just off 44th Street on Manhattan Beach, California.

The photographer - who was so close to the shark he could have touched its tail fin - decided to go shark searching after reports from fellow surfers that a Great White Shark had been spotted in the water.

And amazingly, Mr McConnell - who paddled to three different spots to see the shark - believes he spotted two of the sharks during his search.

'The surfers were looking at me
 like I was crazy, but the shark was acting docile. If I reached down I 
could have grabbed his tail fin, but I didn’t want to push my luck,' he said.

When Mr McConnell heard about the sightings, he equipped himself with a mask, snorkel and a Pentax waterproof camera before pushing himself out to sea on a prone paddleboard.

He said: 'A neighbour was about to go surfing at 44th Street when some 
guys coming out of the water said there was a shark swimming around. She
 didn’t go out.

'A few other friends had mentioned sightings, so I figured they were hanging around.'

When he failed to spot a shark at 44th Street, the determined surfer paddled another seven blocks to Rosecrans Avenue, where he hoped to catch a sighting.

While he was there, Mr McConnell spotted a shadow lurking beneath him - which he believes was a Great White Shark.

But due to poor visibility, the photos Mr McConnell tried to take were not clear. Before he had the chance to take another snap, the shark had disappeared.

Mr McConnell then decided to paddle back to 44th street - where he 'got lucky' for the second time.

He said: 'I paddled back to 44th Street and got lucky. A 5ft to 6ft shark was circling the surfers, not more than 25 yards from shore.

'Unless the one at Rosecrans followed me, I think this was a different one.'

Mr McConnell managed to photograph the Great White Shark as it swam between surfers' boards in 6ft of water.

He used his left arm to follow the shark, while clicking away with his camera using his right arm.

Mr McConnell said he believes the shark, which was about the size of an adult human, was a young Great White Shark, based on its white belly, girth, and length.

Sharks generally eat fish and not mammals until they measure around 9ft.
