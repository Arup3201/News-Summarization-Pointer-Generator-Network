As a regular fixture in their society pages it was no surprise that Pippa Middleton was one of the guests of honour at Tuesday's Vanity Fair lunch.

But the Waitrose columnist was more dowdy than dazzling in a simple black and white outfit featuring a creased animal print mini skirt and white blouse.

The star-studded event at Mayfair restaurant 34 Grosvenor Square was hosted by the magazine's editor Graydon Carter, and attended by designer Tom Ford, socialite Jemima Khan and Downton Abbey star Elizabeth McGovern.

Thrifty Pippa recycled one of her 
favourite off-white blazers, adding a pop of interest to the outfit with
a pair of spotted stilettos.

But it was 39-year-old Jemima Khan, 10 years Pippa's senior and dressed all in black, who stole the show.

Jemima is European editor-at-large of Vanity Fair (as well as Associate Editor of the New Statesman) and the statuesque blonde was the epitome of chic in a simple black dress worn with a crepe coat thrown over her shoulders and a Balenciaga bag balancing on her arm.

The 29-year-old sister of the Duchess of Cambridge regularly appears in the 'Society' pages of the magazine

Bare legs and gladiator-style strappy sandals finished her look, which no doubt impressed fellow diner Tom Ford.

The American designer, 51, was dapper as ever in a fitted black suit finished with a wide silk tie and a pair of his £400 own brand aviator sunglasses.

Downton Abbey star Elizabeth McGovern also chose an all black outfit, then injected a bit of sex appeal in some sky-high red suede court shoes.

The restaurant is part of the exclusive Caprice Holdings group, which also includes The Ivy, J.Sheekey and Le Caprice as well as a luxury concierge service.

it is famous for its steak and seafood which are cooked on a custom-made parrilla grill imported from Argentina.

The beef served includes 
Scottish dry-aged grass-fed, Australian Wagyu, US prime Creekstone Farm 
and free-range organic grass-fed beef from the islands on the Parana 
river in northern Argentina and “Lobster mac” (lobster macaroni) is a signature dish.

Designer Tom Ford and Downton Abbey actress Elizabeth McGovern also wore black outfits for the lunch

29-year-old socialite Pippa, who will become an auntie to sister Kate's first born in June is renowned for her classic, conservative style choices.

She seemed to be breaking away from her middle-aged wardrobe late last week when she was spotted at celebrity haunt LouLou's in a pair of baggy, bright Aztec-print trousers by British label Temperley London.

She wore the £295 trousers - likened to pyjamas by some fashion fans - with a simple black top, the same beige crop-jacket and a long gold necklace by Kinnari.

She carried a small clutch bag - a fashion accessory championed by the Duchess of Cambridge.
