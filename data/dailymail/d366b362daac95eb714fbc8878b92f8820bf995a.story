Channel 4 was accused of exploiting children as young as seven by showing children on Benefits Street swearing and misbehaving.

Critics said it was 'utterly reprehensible' that 'distressing' scenes were being shown where youngsters clashed with their parents.

In last night's show 'White Dee' - whose real name is Deirdre
 Kelly - was seen yelling at her tearaway seven-year-old son Gerrard 
after he lost his bicycle before she shouted at him 'your grounded'.

The executive chairman of a school on 'Benefits Street', which is filmed on James Turner Street, in Birmingham, said the welfare of all their pupils was affected as a result of the show.

Fans of the Channel 4 show have been disrupting lessons by posing for selfies next to a road sign outside the classrooms.

Steve Chalke, from the charity that manages Oasis Academy Foundry, said: 'Every day there are endless streams of people queuing up here to have their picture taken by the James Turner Street sign outside the school.

'We have pupils who are scared to go out in the playground at break times and children who are missing classes as a result.'

During last night's episode one of the pupils had the logo on his school uniform blurred.

He added that Benefits Street should not be showing clashes between children.

‘Channel 4 have shown children swearing on the show but these camera crews have followed these families for a year. It is utterly reprehensible to show these difficult moments in family life to the nation,' he said.

‘These children are aged seven or eight or in their early teenage years and this footage is going on Facebook and Twitter and will always be there.

‘We need to have a mature discussion about welfare dependency in this country without demonising one street.’

Asked
 if the individuals on the show had been exploited, he said: 'I believe 
that they have been.

'What I would like to appeal to the rest of the 
country to do is to contact Ofcom and complain if they don't like what 
they have seen.

'If anyone 
thinks that these scenes are detrimental to the welfare and the 
development of young people or they caused unnecessary distress or 
anxiety to them through their involvement in the show then they should 
complain.

'I am told that 1,000 people have complained to Ofcom already but that number should be one million.'

Channel
 4 has defended the programme and insisted they got 'informed consent' 
from the childrens' guardians before showing them on screen.

'Has
 Channel 4 considered all the legal and pastoral implications of showing
 what will be an historical situation and reopening a sensitive 
situation?,' he wrote.

In 
his letter, he added: 'Some of them are currently afraid to play outside
 … for fear of being heckled by the stream of tourists posing by the 
road sign against our school wall.'

The five-part series has been a massive ratings success for Channel 4.

The third episode in the series last 
night pulled in 5.2million people - the biggest audience since the 
Paralympic closing ceremony.

However, the programme has attracted hundreds of complaints to Ofcom from viewers.

The television watchdog will wait until the end of the series before deciding whether to launch a full investigation.

'Filming with any contributors aged under 16 was done with the informed consent of all appropriate adults and the children themselves in accordance with the relevant sections of the Ofcom broadcasting code.

'Any children without consent have been blurred in programmes.'

She added: 'The welfare of the people and particularly of the children appearing in the series is of paramount importance to us. The contributors were briefed extensively before any filming took place and have been given support all the way through the process.

'The main contributors have been offered the opportunity to view the programmes they feature in before transmission.

'We took on board their comments and in some cases made changes to the programmes.'
