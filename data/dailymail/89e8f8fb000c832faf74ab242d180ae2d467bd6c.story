British citizens fighting in Syria may have been involved in the beating and execution of fellow rebels, it has today been claimed.

It comes after a man from London has posted an apparent 'torture' video on Facebook, which appears to show the beating of prisoners.

The man - believed to be with a jihadist rebel group and originally from West London - has uploaded a video in which he claimed to have tortured a fighter with the Free Syrian Army - which is backed by the west.

A man from London fighting in Syria has posted an apparent 'torture' video on Facebook, which appears to show the beating of prisoners

The man - believed to be with a jihadist rebel group and originally from West London - has uploaded a video in which he claimed to have tortured a fighter with the Free Syrian Army - which is backed by the west

Alongside images of the fighter tied to a car tyre and being hit with an iron bar, the 'jihadist' writes that he launched the attack after he 'insulted his brothers'

The prisoner is heard protesting his innocence as he is apparently beaten across the legs with an metal bar, and is stamped on

Alongside images of the fighter tied to a car tyre and being hit with an iron bar, the 'jihadist' writes that he launched the attack after he 'insulted his brothers'.

He said: 'Some FSA are starting to feel they run 
things! This FSA scum never thought we wud 
jump out at them and pick them up after saying some abusive words to our
 brothers.

'Two then got ahead of themselves and
 swore at Allah, at this point there was no stopping us LOL [laugh out 
loud] although we where told to jus leave them.'

The footage - obtained by Sky - is posted alongside text from the poster. He said: 'Some FSA are starting to feel they run things! This FSA scum never thought we wud jump out at them and pick them up after saying some abusive words to our brothers'

The prisoner is heard protesting his innocence as he is apparently beaten across the legs with an metal bar, and is stamped on.

He shouts that he is not a 'kuffar', a non-believer, and that he is a 'mujahid' - a Muslim fighter  - and begs them not to kill him.

Shiraz Maher, a senior fellow at the 
International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College 
London, confirmed to Sky News that the man who posted the video footage was from London.

In a separate picture posted on Twitter by another British citizen in Syria, three prisoners are seen blindfolded, alongside the words: 'Got these criminals today. Insha'Allah [God willing] they will be killed tomorrow. Can't wait for that feeling when you just killed someone'

The same user then posted a picture of a blood soaked hand along with the words: 'My first time!'. But the man later denied he had killed anyone, saying the blood was from a slaughtered animal

It is also believed he has been to university.
