Jewelry giant Tiffany & Co. has joined other big-name brands and featured, for the first time, a same sex couple in their new advertising campaign.

The campaign, titled 'Will You?', features seven portrait scenes of different couples and was shot by Peter Lindbergh.

But it's one frame featuring two men on a New York stoop that really sticks out.

While some high-profile models appear elsewhere in the campaign, the company chose the two men because they are dating in real life, Tiffany spokeswoman Linda Buckley told CNN.

A break in tradition: Iconic jewelry label Tiffany & Co. are using this photo of a same-sex couple as the headline of their new 2015 advertising campaign, which is called 'Will You?'

'Nowadays, the road to marriage is no longer linear,' Buckley told the network. 

'True love can happen more than once with love stories coming in a variety of forms.' 

Attached to the photo of the men, which will appear in magazines, it says: 'Will you promise to never stop completing my sentences or singing off-key, which I’m afraid you do often? And will you let today be the first sentence of one long story that never, ever ends?'

The other photos in the series depict couples in varying stages of their relationships.

Models such as Andreea Diaconu, Joséphine Le Tutour, Luca Gadjus and Cora Emmanuel appear in those photos, according to Fashion Times.

StyleCaster writer Perrie Samotin said the campaign is a clever move in a financial sense.

'(The campaign) honors the idea that love transcends age, race and gender—a sentiment most of us can surely get behind,' Samotin wrote.

'Although it shouldn’t even be an issue, it’s obviously important—both socially and financially—for brands to diversify their target consumers, and paying attention to the LGBTQ community is key.'

But Tiffany, known for its traditionalism and perfectly-wrapped blue boxes, are far from the first to take such a step.

In some aspects they are a few years late.

J. Crew broke the mold in 2011 when it featured one of their designers and his partner in a catalog.

Gap then erected a billboard emblazoned with a same-sex couple the following year.

Banana Republic did the same thing last year.

Then earlier this year, Barney's New York used 17 transgender men and women for its ad campaign.

'Our goal was to convey the strength, beauty and courage of these extraordinary individuals through the iconic photographs and films of Bruce Weber, as well as the insightful writing of Patricia Bosworth,' Barneys creative director Dennis Freedman told Fashion Times.

'Great progress has been made in regards to the lesbian, gay and bisexual community. 

'Unfortunately, the struggle for transgender equality continues. 

'In the end, it is our hope that that we can make a difference through this campaign.'
