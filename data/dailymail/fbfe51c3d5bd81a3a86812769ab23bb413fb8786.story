It may look like an modern art installation in a gallery, but this shell-shaped clock is designed to make telling the time easier.

According to two designers, Westerners read in a straight line and often calculate mathematical equations in a long string too, so can find it unnatural to navigate a circular clock face.

To solve the problem, the Amsterdam-based artists created the Linear Cycle Clock, which features a revolving ‘shell’ indicating the passing hours.

Time for a change? Two designers in Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands, have created the Linear Cycle Clock, which features a 
revolving ‘shell’ that indicates the passing hours

While the shell slowly rotates around a central point like the hands of a clock, it points out the hours on a linear plate, so people only have to glance at the arty timepiece to tell the time.

Of course digital displays already offer people a quick way to tell the time, but most are not so aesthetically pleasing.

Sadly there is no way to mark the passing of seconds on the shell clock but the object is a thought-provoking art project, rather than a commercial offering, Gizmodo reported.

Designers Boaz Cohen and Sayaka Yamamoto, of studio BCXSY 
said: ‘This unique time display offers a playful alternative to one of 
the most known objects to men and may draw some more attention and 
increase awareness to our advance through time.’

Many designers have put their own spin on the clock – from a menagerie of smartwatches offering functions as well as telling the time, to giant installations that track the lunar cycle.

The world's first moon clock is being planned, that will use tidal power to display the moon's phase on its 'face'.

It is intended to sit at the historic 
centre of time at Greenwich, London and would be made of three 
concentric glass rings with LEDs beneath the surface, producing light 
powered by tidal turbines if it is built.

Meanwhile, a robot clock has been designed in Germany that writes the time using a dry wipe pen on a miniature white board.

Its mechanical arms then erase the time from this board, before starting again - and each time the robot writes, the numbers correspond to the real-world time as its being written.

Designers in Washington DC have recently launched a watch that replaces hands with ball bearings so that it can be used by visually impaired people – as well as those who want to tell the time subtly.

The ball in the central groove of the Bradley timepiece rotates to mark the minutes, while another set into its side travels round the face to denote the hours. It costs around $275 (£164).

The Plotclock, pictured, was designed by Thingiverse member Joo, also known as Johannes from Nuremburg. It writes the time, in hours and minutes, on a white board using a dry wipe pen, before erasing it and starting again

Touch the time: As well as helping visually impaired people live independently the Bradley timepiece has been a hit with people with perfect sight too
