Julie Neville, wife of footballer Phil Neville (right), revealed her husband has never mopped or used a Hoover after he made his first coffee in December

Phil Neville has failed to tackle a single piece of housework during his 15-year marriage, his wife revealed yesterday.

The football pundit, who has just made his first cup of coffee at the age of 37, has no idea where the ironing board is kept and would not know how to turn on an oven.

‘All his talent is in his toes, that’s for certain,’ a remarkably sanguine Julie Neville said.

Mr Neville, who played 59 times for England and won six Premier League titles with Manchester United, first hinted at his lack of skill around the house on BBC Radio 5 at the weekend.

In an insight into the cosseted life of top footballers, he said he ‘sprinted into the kitchen’ and phoned his wife to ask ‘how the hell do I make a cup of coffee’ after the Daily Mail’s chief sports reporter Matt Lawton asked for one during an interview at the couple’s £3.6million Cheshire home. 

The father of two later told how he made it with a ‘kettle… two little scoops of coffee’, and laughed: ‘I’ve lived in a bubble all my life.’

His wife then revealed in a separate radio interview that he had never used a vacuum cleaner, mop, dishwasher or washing machine.

And yesterday, when asked if he had any redeeming talents around the house such as putting the rubbish out or mowing the lawn, she told the Mail he did neither.

She added: ‘Ironing? Oh gosh no, he wouldn’t even know where we keep the ironing board… He wouldn’t know how to turn an oven on.

‘I’ve never known anything else and I’m super-domestic so I don’t really mind. Phil is an amazing father and husband – just not domesticated in any way.’

Speaking about her husband’s first attempt to make a cup of coffee, the 39-year-old said: ‘If you’d seen it you would not have thought it was classed as a coffee. I didn’t taste it, but it didn’t look good.’

But the Mail’s Matt Lawton was more generous, saying: ‘For a first go, it was very good.’

As for Mr Neville, he has insisted he would ‘never drink the stuff’ anyway but confirmed that he has made tea.

Mrs Neville, who owns online natural, sport performance and gluten-free products firm WinNaturally.com, is a former girlfriend of David Beckham.

In June, more than 400 viewers complained about Mr Neville’s ‘robotic’ and ‘monotonous’ BBC commentary debut during England’s first World Cup game against Italy. Afterwards, he joked: ‘I helped everyone get to sleep.’

Manchester United players’ inability to cope with everyday tasks was revealed by ex-coach Brian McClair in 2004 when he said ‘none of the players can change a tyre on their cars’.

FATHER

Neville Neville, 65, who was known for being the agent for his sons, is a former league cricketer and commercial director of Bury FC. His unusual name is featured in the classic terrace chant 'Neville Neville is the name of your dad', set to the tune of David Bowie's song Rebel Rebel.

MOTHER

Jill Neville, 63, has been company secretary of Bury FC for more than 20 years and also general manager for the last five years. She was awarded for the freedom of the borough of Bury in 2012. At the time she was said to still be playing rounders and netball, and promoting sport in the area.

THREE SIBLINGS

Gary Neville - England’s most-capped right-back in history - spent his whole career at Manchester United. He won eight Premier League titles, three FA Cups, one League Cup and two Champions Leagues. The 39-year-old is now a coach for England as well as a pundit for Sky Sports.

Phil Neville hung up his boots at the end of the 2012/13 season after racking up 505 Premier League appearances for Manchester United and Everton. He won six Premier League titles, three FA Cups and one Champions League. The 37-year-old father-of-two is now a pundit for the BBC.

Tracey Neville, 37, who went to school in Bury with her two brothers, is a twin of Phil - and a retired England netball player. She won a bronze at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, before retiring due to injury in 2004. She is now director of netball for the Manchester Thunder team.
