While cars have come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades, one serious problem remains: most still have a significant blind spot where the pillars of the car are.

But now a new concept might finally have solved that problem, using cameras to make the pillars 'transparent' when the driver looks towards them and give them 360 degree vision.

The car also has a 'smart' windscreen that displays hazards and projects a 'ghost car' to help the driver find their way through traffic.

UK-based Jaguar Land Rover have unveiled a smart concept car. It uses cameras to make certain parts of the car 'transparent' (shown). When a driver looks to the side, for example, the pillar between the driver and passenger door becomes see-through. This enables the driver to see obstacles or cars outside the vehicle

The technology is employed in a concept car from British engineers at Jaguar Land Rover.

It has cameras fitted to the outside frame of the car to provide a live feed onto screens on the pillars inside the car.

This essentially makes them see-through, with the feed kicking in the moment the driver indicates, moves their head over their shoulder or approaches a junction.

Driving in thick fog can be rather unnerving, with it being difficult to see other cars in the low visibility conditions.

But a new heads-up-display (HUD) for cars could alleviate these concerns by showing the position of other cars on the windscreen.

The fighter-jet-style display can alert drivers to other cars in dense fog and other extreme weather conditions - and this could help avoid a collision.

The display is being developed at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU). 

It is hoped the technology, which is still in concept form, could reduce the potential for accidents.

Dr Wolfgang Epple, Director of Research and Technology at UK-based Jaguar Land Rover, said: 'Our ultimate aim is to reduce road accidents and enhance the urban driving experience.

'The Jaguar Land Rover research team is developing this technology to improve visibility and to give the driver with the right information at the right time.

'If we can keep the driver's eyes on the road ahead and present information in a non-distracting way, we can help drivers make better decisions in the most demanding and congested driving environments.'

Crashing into cyclists and pedestrians could become a thing of the past after engineers with these transparent pillars, designed to give drivers 360 degree vision. Jaguar Land Rover fitted cameras to the outside frame of a concept car to provide a live feed onto screens on the other side. This essentially makes them see-through

The invention is part of Jaguar Land Rover's '360 Virtual Urban Windscreen' research, which also hopes to improve a driver's navigation.

Engineers are also developing the 'Follow-Me Ghost Car Navigation', which projects an image of a vehicle in front of the driver's car for them to follow, turn by turn, to their destination.

The connected car could also enhance navigation by advising the driver to turn left or right at more visible landmarks, such as pubs or shops, rather than just road signs or street names.

Dr Epple added: 'Driving on city streets can be a stressful experience, but imagine being able to drive across town without having to look at road signs, or be distracted trying to locate a parking space as you drive by.

'We want to present all of this information on a Heads-Up Display in the driver's eye-line, so the driver doesn't have to seek it out for themselves and take their eyes off the road ahead.'
