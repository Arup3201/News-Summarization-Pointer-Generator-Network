Levski Sofia have been fined just under £8,000 after fans mocked one of the anti-racism campaigns launched by European soccer's governing body UEFA in a Bulgarian league match last month.

The Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) imposed the relatively small fine on Wednesday after several Levski supporters held up a banner stating 'Say yes to racism' and doctored UEFA logo during their 3-2 league win over champions Ludogorets.

The ugly incident caused outrage in the Black Sea state.

Bulgarian soccer authorities have long been criticised by anti-racism campaigners, local media and fans for not cracking down hard enough on discrimination in sport.

The incident happened at Levski Sofia's Georgi Asparuhov Stadium during a league match last month

Levski, 26-times Bulgarian champions and one of the country's two most popular clubs along with bitter city rivals CSKA, have a history of racism at their matches.

The BFU fined the club £15,000 after their supporters displayed a banner showing a swastika and another one marking what would have been Adolf Hitler's birthday during their game at Litex Lovech in April 2013.

In 2012, Levski were fined £24,000 by UEFA for racist behaviour by fans during a Europa League match against Bosnia & Herzegovina's Sarajevo.
