Facebook is set to launch its own search engine to take on Google, it was claimed today.

The firm is due to make a major announcement tonight, asking journalists to attend its US HQ to 'see what we've been building'.

Online rumours have claimed everything from a mobile phone to an internet telephone service is set to be revealed - with the latest rumours claiming we will see 'Facebook Search' unveiled.

Facebook's mysterious invite, which was sent to US journalists. Some believe it may see the firm launch its own mobile phone.

According to website Pocket-Lint, the move is a 'no brainer' for Facebook.

'Although exact details of how the 
new search engine will work remain unclear for now, we have been told 
that the social network is planning to launch a big new 'search feature'
on the site 'very soon', one that will shake everything up,' the site 
claimed.

Facebook already offers a basic search feature on its site, allowing users to look for 'people, places and things'.

However, it is believed tonight's announcement could see this dramatically upgraded.

'If Facebook were to allow users to 
quickly search the social network and beyond for example, it could cause
major headaches for Google: the new feature would give Facebook users a
reason to bypass Google altogether,' said Pocket Lint.

'This could do very well,' Stuart Miles of Pocket Lint told MailOnline.

'A lot of people are used to Facebook, and I think it's a no-brainer.

'Google has tried to get into social with Google+, and the two areas go together.'

Mr Miles also warned Facebook would need to tread carefully around privacy, but said: 'As long as Facebook doesn't touch settings, users will not be worried'.

The new feature is expected to be made available within hours of tonight's announcement.

Some experts also believe Facebook could reveal a mobile phone.

The firm has been rumoured several times to be developing its own phone.

Its apps for existing phones have already been expanded to include many features found in other handsets, such as messaging and photo sharing through the recent purchase of Instagram.

Recent reports claim it has poached engineers from Apple's iPhone and iPad team to work on the project, which is believed to be being built by HTC.

The social networking giant has also previously collaborated with HTC to launch the ChaCha and Salsa phones with a dedicated 
Facebook button and deep integration of the social network.

However, it is believed the new handset could be fully Facebook branded, and run far more of the firm's software than any other handset.

Facebook is also preparing to roll 
out a new feature for its Messenger app which allows users to place free
voice calls to friends.

The feature is so far available only 
to iPhone users in Canada and is buried within the latest update to the 
app, but it will eventually allow users to make free internet voice 
calls, known as VoIP calls, to any Facebook friend.

Experts are saying it represents an 
attempt by the world's largest social network to dominate the social 
world by taking on the default calling function in mobile phones.
