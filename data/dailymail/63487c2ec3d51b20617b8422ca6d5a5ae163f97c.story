World Cup winner Joachim Low says he will remain Germany manager for the 2016 European Championship in France.

There was speculation Low would follow captain Philipp Lahm's lead after Germany beat Argentina 1-0 in the World Cup final at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, despite his contract being extended before the tournament.

But Low has told the German Football Federation he is here to stay. Assistant manager Hansi Flick, however, has stepped down to become a technical director for DFB.

'At the 
moment, I can think of nothing more beautiful than to continue working with this 
team to lead them to the European Championships in France, to develop the team and the individual players further,' Low told the DFB website.

'I am as motivated as I was on the first day at the DFB. We celebrated a gigantic success in Brazil, but there are still other goals we want to achieve.

'The 2014 World Cup was a highlight for all, but it was not a conclusion.'

Low took time off after winning the World Cup, adding to suspicions he was considering his position. This, however, was simply to come to terms with his emotions, he insists.

Low will be forced to continue without Flick as his No 2, but the 54-year-old refuses to be rushed into finding a replacement.

'Also for Hansi Flick, Brazil was not the conclusion,' added Low. 'As sports director of the DFB, he will be in the future in a different function.'

Low, who joined the DFB in 2004 and became manager in 2006, will also take time to consider his next skipper.

Bayern Munich midfielder Lahm unexpectedly retired internationally five days after leading Germany to their World Cup win, telling Low his decision the morning after the final.

'I could not have wished for a better captain,' says Low, 'he did an outstanding job influencing, leading and present the team.

'I regret that he will not return but I accept and respect his decision.'

Germany and Argentina play a friendly rematch in Duesseldorf on September 3 four days before Low's men face Scotland for Euro 2016 qualifying.
