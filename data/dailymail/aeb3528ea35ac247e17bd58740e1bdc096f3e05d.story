An award-winning nature photographer found dead in a stream at a remote beauty spot may have accidentally fallen from a tree to his death while trying to spot wildlife, an inquest heard.

Building society cashier Trevor Whitehead, 51, had walked to a secluded spot of woodland on the lookout for birds and other creatures.

One theory is that he was overcome by a dizzy spell as he clambered onto a branch 30ft above the ground before falling to his death, a coroner was told.

It is thought he may have been lying dead for weeks before his  body was discovered by a father and his two children who were climbing up to a waterfall.

At an inquest, a coroner was unable to rule on a cause of death but inquiries revealed Mr Whitehead's rucksack was found hanging from the tree branch above his body in a renowned wildlife haven in Belthorn, Lancashire.

The hearing was told Mr Whitehead, from Accrington, Lancashire, who lived alone, worked at the Skipton Building Society and was 'mad' on wildlife and would go out walking every weekend and often before work.

He would travel to Scotland to watch the seals and once won a Canon Camera competition for the Prince's Trust for a photograph of a butterfly as well as numerous other prizes.  

The hearing in Blackburn was told Mr Whitehead trekked to what was described as a 'good vantage point for bird and nature watching' where ramblers or walkers rarely used a track.

He was reported missing by his mother on April 11 after he failed to show up for work - but no trace of him was found despite public appeals and searches by mountain rescue teams.

He was found at around noon on May 31 by Christopher Shaw and his two children who spotted his body in shallow water within the ravine which had steep sided overgrown gullies. 

In Mr Whitehead's rucksack, there was found to be medication from 2011 thought to have been for leg pain, a receipt for energy bars purchased on April 5, a wallet and an empty bread wrapper.

But despite further investigations it was not possible to say for certain if he had fallen from the branch which was said not to have been 'suitable for body weight'.

No injuries or fractures were found and any third party involvement was ruled out.

Mr Whitehead's mother Alice said: 'He didn't always take his camera but often if he found any tracks he would go back and get his camera.' 

But she said she used to 'tell him off' for not having a mobile phone despite his many walks over the moors.

She added that he had complained of feeling dizzy three weeks before he went missing on April 5. 

Mrs Whitehead added that she knew her son had gone to the spot before with friends and added: 'I honestly think he might have gone dizzy and fallen.'

PC Gillian Maltram of Lancashire Police said that his body was found clothed in 'very poor terrain' and in an area that was not a common route for ramblers.

The statement said that the branch where his rucksack was found was 'a great point for bird watching with a good view onto the meadow on the opposite side of the stream', but was 'incapable' of holding body weight towards the end.

Pathologist Dr Richard Prescott told the inquest  he did not believe there to have been any signs of foul play, nor could he see any skull fractures in keeping with a fall. He said the death was 'unascertained'.

Coroner Michael Singleton, concluding an open verdict, said: 'I know he was somebody that very much enjoyed watching wildlife and nature. 

'We heard that going up towards the waterfall was quite spectacular. His rucksack was found on a branch on a tree that gives rise to the possibility that he fell from that tree.

'It is equally possibly having put his rucksack safe he may have been walking along the stream intending to make towards the waterfall. It's possible he fell, that he slipped, that he collapsed.

'The post mortem does not give any clues, there's no evidence he intended to cause himself any harm. 

'In fact evidence is that he was looking forward. It is not for me to guess as to what may be the cause. I cannot reach a conclusion as to how Trevor Whitehead came to die in these circumstances.'
