Barack Obama will meet film directors, bankers and media moguls as he strives to fill the coffers of his re-election effort on a vital fundraising tour.

He will visit the homes of media mogul Fred Eychaner and Bear Stearns executive Stuart Taylor in his hometown of Chicago, Illinois, on January 11.

The President will also be hosted in Manhattan, New York, by Inside Man film director Spike Lee for a $38,500-per-head reception on January 19.

And he will also be at a discussion with Jewish leaders in four-star French  restaurant Daniel in Manhattan that day, reported the New York Post.

President Obama has raised $100million for his campaign so far, compared to the $33million raised by his biggest GOP rival Mitt Romney.

Rick Perry has raised the next highest amount, at $17million, followed by Ron Paul on $13million, reported the New York Times.

No other remaining candidates have raised more than $5million. President Obama had more cash by last October than all the GOP candidates.

‘Daniel has hosted so many fund-raisers 
for Obama, it has become New York’s official Democratic dining room,’ a 
source told the New York Post.

Mr Lee’s event with wife Tonya Lewis at their Upper East Side apartment will be a reception for 60 paying guests, reported the New York Post.

He described President Obama’s election a 'seismic' global change but criticised his response to the BP oil spill two years ago, reported Politico.

President Obama’s campaign raised around $750,000 in the 2008 campaign and he is expected to beat that for the 2012 election.

The Republican contest got off to a 
tight start in Iowa on Tuesday night as Mitt Romney edged out Rick 
Santorum and comfortably beat Ron Paul.

On the same evening the President appealed to Democrats in Iowa, where he launched his White House ambitions four years ago.

He was hosting a live video teleconference for Democrats attending precinct caucuses across Iowa, outlining his progress during the first term.

The president’s campaign emailed fans a video of his Iowa victory speech in January 2008, arguing he has kept the promises he made that night.

These included making health care more affordable, cutting middle class taxes, ending the Iraq war and reducing dependence on foreign oil.

But White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Obama ‘has a lot of work to do before he engages aggressively in the general election’.

President Obama was wasting little time getting back in front of voters following a Hawaiian vacation spent largely out of the spotlight.

On Wednesday he travelled to Ohio for an event focused on the economy to counter months of pounding by Republicans in Iowa.

Trying to build on his 2008 win in Iowa, his campaign has opened eight offices and made 350,000 phone calls to supporters since last April.
