Britain has not lost its 'appetite to intervene' as a military power, the Defence Secretary said yesterday.

In a speech in Washington, Philip Hammond said the West had been complacent to ignore threats from Vladimir Putin before the invasion of Crimea and called on Nato and European allies to 'raise their game' to boost defence spending.

Mr Hammond told the Heritage Foundation think-tank: 'It is important that we reassure our allies in deed as well as word – and that is why the UK has offered Typhoon jets to augment Nato's Baltic Air Policing mission.

'I am used to representing a country whose resolve and willingness to use military force is not doubted.'

Referring to Parliament voting against military action in Syria last August, he added: 'It does not mean we have lost our appetite to intervene.

'Over these last few weeks, we have been reminded, forcefully, of the uncertainty of the world we live in. The old threats have not gone away, as we perhaps too complacently assumed.'

His comments came as David Cameron pledged to defend the Baltic states from Russian aggression. With fears growing that Putin might use force against Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania, the Prime Minister told MPs that Nato would act because they were all members of the alliance, whose founding principle is that an attack on one is an attack on all.

Mr Cameron said: 'I think we should do everything we can to reassure our friends and colleagues in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and in Poland, that we really believe in their Nato membership and the guarantees that we have given to them.'

Warning: Russia's President Vladimir Putin speaks in the Kremlin in Moscow

Vitali Klitschko, the Ukrainian boxer turned opposition leader, accused Britain of not doing enough to deter Putin from going further.

On a visit to Parliament yesterday, he said Britain had guaranteed Ukrainian territorial integrity under a 1994 agreement and called for tougher sanctions to be inflicted on Russia.

Mr Klitschko said: 'We expect from the British Government more pressure, more action.  Crimea is not the goal. Putin is very open. The idea is to build a new Russian empire.'

A Commons committee today warns ministers against further defence cuts. The MPs said the crisis in Crimea proved that the UK must retain a 'credible deterrent capability' against new threats. Their report says: 'A failure to do so could have significant implications for the country's security.'

Under controversial Whitehall plans, by 2020 the Armed Forces will have axed 30,000 troops plus hundreds of warships, jets, spy planes and tanks.

MPs said the National Security Council needed to re-evaluate the threat level to the UK following events in Ukraine when it updated the National Security Strategy next year.

James Arbuthnot, the committee chairman, said: 'Deterrence must be credible to be effective: Britain has to show the capacity and the will to respond proportionately and effectively to threats at every level.'

Visiting a First World War battlefield in Flanders yesterday, US President Barack Obama said: 'The situation in Ukraine reminds us that our freedom isn't free, and we've got to be willing to pay for the assets, the personnel, the training that's required.'
