Oprah Winfrey insisted that she WAS a victim of racism and she experienced what 'people of black or brown color experience daily', in an interview with a Swiss newspaper published today.

Oprah, one of the world's richest women, revealed on Entertainment Tonight last week that she felt discriminated against when a sales assistant in a luxury Zurich Boutique refused to show her a $38,000 handbag designed by Tom Ford and named after Jennifer Aniston.

'I was asked if I am confronted with 
racism,' she told Swiss daily Blick in an interview in Los Angeles on 
Monday night but not published until today. 

Casual 'racism': Oprah, who said she was dressed nicely, told the newspaper that what she experienced was what 'people of black or brown color experience daily'

'My
 answer - not in the same way as others because I am so well known. 
Except on Twitter, no-one dares confront me with the N-word. I feel 
discrimination in a different way.

'My antenna receives an underlying "what is going on here?" I called
 Zurich an example, because it was happening.'

Asked
 if she was being 'particularly sensitive,' she said: 'No! I know of no 
black man who was never stopped by police because of his skin color, or 
persecuted, but it's different for women. What I've experienced in 
Switzerland happened only once before in my life.

'So
 I didn't want to indict Switzerland. It was a single incident. An 
incident that people of black or brown color experience daily.

She even added that she was tempted to call her friends Ford or Aniston as she stood in the store.

'That damn bag': Oprah said that if she had known the cost of the bag when she asked to see it - she probably would have thought it was too expensive

'Snub': Oprah said in the interview that shop assistants 'usually 
rejoice when she enters a store', owned by Trudie Goetz, above. Oprah 
added: 'People usually press their noses flat against the windows to see
 me shopping'

'It
 was however uncommon for that to happen to me. Believe me, usually 
sales people rejoice when I come to them in their business. It is very 
unusual that I'm not really involved when in a boutique. Outside, people
 usually press their noses flat against the windows to see me shopping.'

Oprah
 had claimed in the original Entertainment Tonight that the Italian-born sales 
assistant refused to show her the crocodile leather bag, the suggestion being, 
she implied, that as a black woman she could not afford it.

The
 incident happened at the Trois Pommes Boutique in Storchengasse, a 
street behind the ritzy Bahnhofstrasse in Zurich, one of the world's 
wealthiest and most expensive cities. 

Oprah
 was invited to be a guest in July at the wedding of soul singer Tina 
Turner in Switzerland and wanted a handbag to compliment her outfit.

She
 went on: 'I was the only person in the store. I had dressed myself up 
extra special because I know that things can get very snobby in these 
kinds of stores.

'The 
employees first check out what clothes you're wearing. Therefore I chose
 a Donna Karan outfit - and even washed my hair even. So nobody could 
mistake me for a homeless person who got lost in the store.

'The
 woman did not want to get down the bag which I wanted to look at. The 
effort was too much for her. She said to me, that the bag was simply too
 expensive. And I said: "I want to see it anyway."  Instead she tossed 
me cheaper bags.

'I said: "Okay, thank you very much!  But I really want to see the others."  She still kept showing me the cheaper ones.

Friends: Oprah said she felt like calling Tom Ford - who designed the bag - or Jennifer Aniston - who it was named after, as she stood there in the store

Touchy: Oprah denied claims that she was being 'over-sensitive' about race after the incident at the upmarket store in Zurich, above

'To
 be honest, if I had known upfront what this damned bag cost, do you 
know what? The woman was right: I would not have bought the thing - far 
too expensive! Too expensive! $38,000! I would have fainted when I saw 
the price tag.'

She 
continued: 'The saleslady said it was the Jennifer Aniston bag that was 
created by Tom Ford for Jennifer.  The idea went through my head that I 
should call Jennifer or Tom - I know them both very well. Instead I said
 to the saleslady: "Okay, I understand. The bag is just for Jennifer, 
and only she is allowed to buy it, right?

'The
 woman said "no, no" and tried to explain something. But I was no longer
 listening. I just said: "Thank you very much, you're probably right 
that I can't afford it."

'I 
went. I didn't want to make a scene. Really not. That's why it annoys me
 now too, that it has become this major international story. And that 
the names of Tom Ford and Jennifer Aniston were pulled in too. The whole
 thing is really quite annoying.'

She
 acknowledges the apologies of the owner Trudie Goetz and the anonymous 
saleslady but added: 'But I don't know whether the apology brings 
something. Discrimination is there, anywhere around the world, every 
day. As I said, I did not want to bring the whole of Switzerland into 
disrepute.

'Perhaps she 
never wanted to reach for the bag because it was too high up. Does 
anyone know? Anyway, I had a great time in Switzerland. My friend Tina 
Turner got married, I went for a walk every day. It's a pity that such a
 big deal is now being made out of this other thing.'

The
 publication of the frank interview will do nothing to quell the war of 
words currently raging between the TV talk show queen and Goetz.

Yesterday
 Goetz said she wanted to speak personally to Winfrey and defended her 
employee to the hilt, adding: ‘I don't know why she talked of racism.  I
 am sorry, but perhaps she is being a little over-sensitive here.  Maybe
 she was somewhat offended because she was not immediately recognized in
 the store.'

Regrets: Oprah says she is sorry that he vacation to Switzerland was overshadowed by what happened as she had a lovely time walking and at the wedding of Tina Turner and Erwin Back, above
