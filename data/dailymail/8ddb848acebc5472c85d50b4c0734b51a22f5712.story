Etihad Airways' Flying Nanny service provides families travelling on long-haul flights with an extra helping hand 

The Flying Nanny service, which begins at the boarding gate and continues until the families have safely disembarked, is free of charge on long-haul flights.

Staff, who are all cabin crew members, ware on hand to look after unaccompanied minors, prepare bassinets for babies, refill bottles, seat youngsters and keep children entertained with activities such as crafts, face-painting and magic tricks.

The helpers have all completed in-depth training at Bath's Norland College, an institution which has been training childcare professionals since 1892.

Aubrey Tiedt, Etihad Airways' Vice President Guest Services, said: 'Flying with a young family can be a daunting task, even for the most experienced travellers, and the Flying Nanny role demonstrates our understanding of our guests' needs and our commitment to making the journey as relaxing and comfortable as possible.'

During the flight the Flying Nanny is on hand to help families - as well as support other cabin crew members when they interact with families, such as serving kids' meals early.

Ms Tiedt added: 'The Flying Nanny will liaise with parents and use their experience and knowledge to make the travel experience easier. 

'This includes helping serve children's meals early in the flight and offering activities and challenges to help entertain and occupy younger guests.'

For older children, the Flying Nanny is equipped with simple quizzes and challenges to keep them occupied as well as taking them on tours of the galley during quieter moments of the flight.  

Brisbane mother Kerri Scholz told new.com.au that she was taken by surprise by the service when she and husband Nathan flew to Europe with their three children aged eight, seven and four, in July. 

As well as helping to mop out after an 'accident' with her youngest, Mrs Scholz said the orange-aproned nanny nursed other passengers' babies ensuring everyone got some peace and quiet.

'There definitely wasn't the noise that you get on most long-haul flights with children,' Mrs Scholz said.
