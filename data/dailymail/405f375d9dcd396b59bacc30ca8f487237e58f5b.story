A Wisconsin judge says the actor who played Screech on the 1990s TV series 'Saved by the Bell' must stand trial in a Christmas Day stabbing.

Dustin Diamond, 37, is charged with reckless endangerment and two other counts in the fight at a bar near Milwaukee.

Ozaukee County Judge Paul Malloy heard a police officer's testimony Monday before saying there is enough evidence for the case against Diamond to continue.

Dustin Diamond, aka Screech from 'Saved by the Bell,' must stand trial over a Christmas Day bar stabbing in his small Wisconsin hometown, a judge ruled

Diamond is free on bail while he awaits trial on the December 26 reckless endangerment, possession of a concealed weapon and disorderly conduct charges

Diamond is known playing nerdy Samuel 'Screech' Powers during the 1990s hit 'Saved by the Bell.' He stayed with the show, and its spin offs, from 1988 until 2000 

The officer clarified earlier reports and said that Diamond had a pocket knife - and not  a switch-blade, as the arresting documents initially stated.

A criminal complaint says Diamond and his fiancee got into a tussle with two men and a woman at the Grand Avenue Saloon in Port Washington. Diamond lives in the small community 30 miles north of Milwaukee.

Diamond told police he accidentally stabbed one of the men while trying to defend his fiancee. The man was not seriously injured.

Police say surveillance video from the Grand Ave. Saloon shows Diamond swing the knife after he was shoved by another bar patron.

Diamond claims he was defending his fiancee Amanda Schutz when and that he didn't mean to stab anyone

The victim said he did not realize he had been stabbed until he saw blood on his shirt.

He was treated for the minor puncture wound and is recovering. 

Diamond is known for playing Samuel 'Screech' Powers, from 1988 until 2000 on four 'Saved by the Bell' shows.

Since then, he starred in a porn video and has had minor success on the reality TV circuit. 

Diamond's lawyer requested that he be allowed to travel to speaking and acting engagements across the country - and possibly around the world - while he remains free on bail awaiting his trial. 

The judge agreed to the first request - and said Diamond would have to seek permission before leaving the country.
