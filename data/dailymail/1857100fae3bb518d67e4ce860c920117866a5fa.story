Gunmen have launched coordinated attacks on an airport, state television station and military base during an attempted coup in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Forces loyal to the president Joseph Kabila fought off the heavily armed militants - killing 40 and arresting more, according to Government sources.

The armed assault earlier today on three sites around the country's capital Kinshasa appears 
to be an attempt to seize power by supporters of religious leader Paul 
Joseph Mukungubila.

Before transmission was shut down at 
state television, two gunmen appeared on camera to deliver what appeared
 to be a political message against President Kabila, who took 
office in 2001 after the assassination of his father Laurent.

'Gideon Mukungubila has come to free 
you from the slavery of the Rwandan,' said the message, according to a 
Reuters reporter who saw a tape of the transmission. Gideon is the 
nickname used for Mukungubila by his followers.Â 

Coup: The violent clash between militants and government security forces is thought to have been a failed attempt to topple the country's president

Mukungubila, who calls himself 'The prophet of the Eternal', ran unsuccessfully for the presidency against Kabila in 2006.

He
 has been an outspoken critic of a peace deal signed this month with the
 Tutsi-led M23 rebel group in eastern Congo, accusing Kabila's 
government of bowing to Tutsi interests and pressure from neighbouring 
Rwanda.

Police put a security cordon around the state television building where gunmen had taken several people hostage.

Witnesses also reported shooting at the Tshatshi military camp, close to the Defence Ministry.

A customs official at the international airport on the

'Shooting has started here,' the official told Reuters. 'They are shooting everywhere. We are all hiding.'

Information Minister Lambert Mende said the situation was now under control.

'The attackers presented themselves as
 supporters of Mukungubila. We are checking because this could be an 
attempt to fool us,' he told Reuters.

Mr Mende told the BBC
 the attackers at the state TV and radio headquarters were armed with 
weapons such as knives, and there was 'no chance of them even to 
maintain their positions, even for a single hour'.

'People were frightened when security
 personnel were firing against these attackers,' the minister told the 
BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme after visiting the RTNC 
headquarters.

In
 central Kinshasa, the streets emptied and shopkeepers closed their 
shutters.

Congo, a vast
 country at the heart of Africa, is struggling to emerge from decades of
 violence and instability, particularly in its mineral-rich east, in 
which millions of people have died, mostly from hunger and disease.

The country is home to a 21,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO).
