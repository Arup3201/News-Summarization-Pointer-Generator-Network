It is expected to be the ‘must have’ new video game for youngsters, boasting some of the best-loved characters from Disney films.

But to the dismay of parents, Disney Infinity comes with a potential price tag of more than £250 – and is said to put pressure on children to add a ‘never-ending’ string of extras.

The interactive game works by placing collectible toy figures on a Disney Infinity Base – a portal that operates through an existing games console to ‘warp’ the character on to the screen.

To infinity and beyond: The interactive game will be released next month and additional figures are set to be launched before Christmas, when the pressure to fork out for the 'must have' toy of the moment is at its peak

Starter packs, including the video game, base and three toy figures, are expected to cost between £50 and £60 on release next month.

But it costs £12 to add each of the 17 other figurines available, and £4 for add-on packs that can improve strength and speed in the game.

More figures are expected to be launched before Christmas, adding to the pressure on parents to give in to pester power.

Siobhan Freegard, founder of parenting advice site Netmums, said: ‘I do worry that at the moment so many parents are strapped for cash.

‘It’s not a cheap present – and to go back to school and find Little Johnny down the road has all the characters will make it hard. It is a never-ending thing.  Parents need to know what they’re signing up to.’ 

Concerns have also been raised about the £4 add-ons that can provide new powers or change the background of the game.

Mrs Freegard said: ‘I’m not sure I like that your character can be better because your parents have more money.’ 

The Disney Infinity concept borrows heavily from Skylanders, a hugely successful game that has more than 100 collectible character figures in a similar price range.

The Disney Infinity starter packs come with the characters Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean, Sulley from  Monsters University and Mr Incredible from The Incredibles.

Additional play sets will feature ‘villains’, ‘sidekicks’ and characters from Disney’s latest live action film The Lone Ranger, starring Johnny Depp. 

Disney argues the game offers value because the figures can be traded between friends and used on different consoles such as the Xbox 360, Sony PS3 and Nintendo Wii.

Constantly upgrading and expanding the game with  characters from existing and upcoming films means that it cannot become obsolete either, says the US movie giant. 

It is also claimed that the game educates youngsters as they learn ‘basic programming’ to create unique challenges, scenarios and mini games in its ‘Toy Box’ mode.

Disney Infinity’s lead producer John Day said: ‘I have two boys, ages two and four, and I like  the idea that they can be learning about how to do logical connections using the toys in the Toy Box.

‘We can bring in toys like buttons and doorways, and you can connect the button to the doorway and have the button open the door when you step on it.

‘It seems very basic, but at the same time we’re talking about logical inputs and outputs. It really is a lightweight programming language.’

A Disney spokesman said: ‘Disney Infinity will deliver incredible value to consumers.

‘Each of the play sets features an original, true-to-property experience offering hours of gameplay and in the Toy Box mode, players will have endless possibilities to create unique challenges, scenarios and mini games.

‘In addition, there’s a lot of opportunity for exploration, multiplayer and other options that will extend play time and encourage replayability.’
