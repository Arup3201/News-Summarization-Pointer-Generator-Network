An elderly man who fell off a pier into the sea while riding his mobility scooter has died in hospital.

Stuart Farquhar, 87, is believed to have been attempting a three-point turn when he fell into the freezing North Sea on Friday morning.

He was pulled from the water at Pennan, near Aberdeen, and airlifted to hospital. But police today confirmed that the man had died.

Injured: The victim is transferred from an ambulance to an helicopter to be flow from Pennan, where he fell into the sea, to Aberdeen Royal Infermary

The man was strapped into the scooter when he fell into the icy water at Pennan in Aberdeenshire.

Shocked locals leapt into action when they saw him plunge over the edge shortly before 11am.

They managed to haul the man to safety and kept him calm until a rescue team arrived at the scene.

The RAF Sea King Rescue 137 was scrambled and he was flown to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for treatment.

The extent of his injuries are not yet clear.

It is not known whether the disabled man had travelled to the village as a tourist or if he lives nearby.

Thousands of film fans flock to the tiny fishing hamlet every year to see the spot immortalisted in the cult classic Local Hero.

The whitewashed strip of houses known as Pennan became instantly recognisable after its starring role in Bill Forsyth's 1983 movie.

The film follows a David and Goliath struggle between a US petro petro-chemical giant and the sleepy seaside village - which was renamed Ferness for the silverscreen.

In the end the Americans are won over by the beauty and pace of life on the Scottish shoreline and scrap plans for an onshore refinery.

The pub still serves old ales, the iconic red phone box still works and life goes at a slightly slower pace than the outside world.

And it seems after yesterday's drama that the village is aptly named due to local heroes saving the disabled man's life.
