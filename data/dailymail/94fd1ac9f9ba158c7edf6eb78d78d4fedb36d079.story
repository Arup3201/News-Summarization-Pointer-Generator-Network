Ghassan Hitto, the Syrian opposition's newly elected prime minister, says he has no intention of entering into dialogue with President Bashar al-Assad

He enjoys American football, has an American-born wife, and has spent the last 30 years bringing up four children in the suburbs of Dallas, Texas.

But 50-year-old Ghassan Hitto is, as of yesterday, the new prime minister of the Syrian opposition National Coalition.

And now the Syrian-born IT executive who follows the Dallas Cowboys has lofty ambitions: to bring stability and peace to the wartorn homeland he left as a teenager.

Mr Hitto started as he means to go 
on, with the bald statement: 'Our main goal is to bring about the 
downfall of the Assad regime by all means and while providing the basic 
services to our people on the inside.'

He said he had no intention of trying to enter into dialogue with the Syrian president.

The bespectacled father of four was chosen to run the opposition coalition, the main political grouping opposing President Bashar al-Assad, in an election held in Turkey, where he has been living, yesterday.

The coalition was formed with Western and Gulf backing in Qatar last year to bring together Assad's political foes and build an alternative government structure to replace his rule.

But after a brief period of harmony, divisions have racked the group, with its liberal minority accusing the powerful Muslim Brotherhood and its allies, who include a handful of Christians, of assuming control of the coalition.

After a meeting in Istanbul yesterday, the coalition chose Mr Hitto, the Western-educated exile who is little known in Syria, as provisional prime minister.Â  He was elected with 35 out of 48 votes.

Mr Hitto was backed by the Muslim 
Brotherhood and opposition coalition Secretary General Mustafa Sabbagh, 
who has strong links with Gulf Arab states, according to sources at the 
meeting.

However his 
election was not to everyone's tastes, and nine people suspended their 
membership of the Syrian National Coalition after Mr Hitto was named as 
prime minister.

Veteran opposition campaigner Walid 
al-Bunni said: 'The Muslim Brotherhood, with the backing of Qatar, have 
imposed their prime minister candidate. We will keep away if the 
coalition does not reconsider its choice.'

Fans of Mr Hitto, who left Damascus in his teens to study in the US, has lived and worked in IT for nearly 30 years in Dallas, where he is a well-known member of the local Muslim community.

He helped run an Islamic school, the Brighter Horizons Academy, in Texas, where three of his children have been educated, and where his wife, Suzanne, still works teaching English.

But despite having built a life for himself in American, Mr Hitto remained committed to helping rebuild his homeland.

Last year he quit his job, left Dallas and moved to Istanbul to 'join the ranks of the Syrian revolution'.

Now he faces the challenge of uniting the opposition against the Assad regime and bringing stability to the fighting and poverty-ravaged rebel-held areas.

Mr Hitto will also need to build, and raise, his profile in his native land - some are opposed to him on the grounds that he does not live there and hasn't for years.

However his supporters say he is just what the country needs.

Ahmad Abo Kayass, president of the Coalition for Free Syria, told The Times: 'His greatest qualities are leadership, he listens to people, and he is decisive and determined.'

'Some people are saying "Who is this guy?" but they will be really happy with him being the prime minister.'
