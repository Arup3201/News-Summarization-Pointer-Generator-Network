Before finding fame on The Only Way Is Essex, Jessica Wright was a relatively unknown fledgling pop star and glamour model.

But, as well as heartbreak and drama, her stint on the reality TV show has lead to unprecedented success, countless modelling deals and even her own fashion collection. 

And now, the Essex-born star has landed herself yet another campaign, this time as the first-ever ambassador for premium hair extension brand, Whitney Marie.

Donning glitzy embellished gowns and adorning the celebrity inspired clip-in extensions, which are 100 per cent human Brazilian Remy hair, Jessica oozes old school Hollywood glamour in the new shoot. 

Speaking about her latest campaign, Jessica said: 'I am so excited to be working with Whitney Marie, their hair is super soft and is so easy to put in. 

'I love the ombre designs and how you can switch between the clip-in’s or the ponytails!'.

The 28-year-old says she is a huge fan of the  clip-in extensions and pony tails, which are 100 per cent human Brazilian Remy hair, because they're so easy to use

The brand's founder added: 'Working with Jessica was an easy choice, her hair is so versatile, it looks beautiful styled up or down and she is a pleasure to work with.' 

Jessica's new beauty campaign comes just the stylish star unveiled her spring/summer 15 designs for Lipstick Boutique. 

Speaking about her new drop, which ranges in price between £35-£80, Jessica told FEMAIL: 'This is all really exciting and I have been much braver with the prints this season by incorporating lots of floral and colour block.'

Moving the brand forward for spring/summer, Jessica has taken on board customer feedback and enhanced the range by adding more shapes, such as long, midi and skater. 

'Tight and short skirts can often look tacky so I have taken real care when designing the cuts of the clothes,' said Jess.

Jessica found fame as Mark Wright's fledgling pop star singer on the hit ITVBe show

The new beauty campaign comes in the same month that Jessica unveiled her new fashion range

Citing her muse as 'amazing' Blake Lively, Jess says she's taken a 'tiny' bit of inspiration from Victoria Beckham, whose shift dresses she loves, and it would be a 'dream come true' to see Cheryl Fernandez-Versini wearing her designs. 

As well as watching her collection evolve, Jess has also seen her own style change over the years.

'We all had the typical bodycon dresses when we started out on TOWIE,' said Jess of herself and her co-stars' dress sense. 

'But now I have a much more mature outlook on fashion, it has become a real passion of mine. I don't have a stylist, I just totally dress myself.'

So enamored is Jess with all things style that she's planning on launching a shoe collection.

'I am a total shoe addict, footwear is my thing,' she said of her upcoming range of 'beautiful brogues, heels and ankle boots'.

Business is booming for Jess, who says it's all 'go, go, go' with filming, various projects and socialising.

She added: 'I want to continue doing what I love, especially fashion, and now I'm single I want to travel the world.'

As well as watching her collection evolve, Jess has also seen her own style change over the years and she's adopted a much more streamlined approach to styling herself
