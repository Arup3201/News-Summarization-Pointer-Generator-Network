Up for grabs: A vial that once contained valium prescribed to Elvis Presley the year before he collapsed and died that is set to be auctioned

These small amber vials contained the drugs that led to music legend Elvis Presley's downfall and death.

The two-inch plastic pots held pills prescribed to The King for anxiety and insomnia in 1976, a year before he was found dead aged 42 at his famous Graceland home.

At the time, Elvis had been taking a cocktail of prescription drugs in an attempt to cope with his dwindling music and film career.

Two tiny pots and a card box which 
once contained the drugs are now up for sale and are expected to sell 
for upwards of £3,000 when they go under the hammer.

One
pot contained 10mg tablets of relaxant valium while the other held 40mg
pills of Inderal, a beta blocker used for hypertension and the 
prevention of heart attacks.

The box used to house a 10ml vial of Vernate, a drug injected to prevent coronary disease and aid digestion.

The labels on the vials are printed with the names 'E. Presley' and 'Elvis Presley'.

They were supplied by The Prescription House in Madison Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee, around seven miles from Graceland.

The
bottles, which have come from Elvis's estate, are labelled with the instruction 'use as directed' and were ordered by Dr George 
Nichopoulos, the star's controversial personal physician.

Dr
Nichopoulos famously tried to revive Elvis after discovering his 
lifeless body on August 16, 1977. He later faced trial in 1980 for 
overprescribing drugs to the star.

The
trial revealed that in 1977 alone, Nichopoulos had prescribed The King 
over 10,000 doses of drugs including amphetamines and barbiturates, 
narcotics and tranquilisers.

Nichopoulos, dubbed Dr Feelgood by the media, was initially cleared of any wrongdoing but had his licence revoked in 1995 on the same grounds.

Garry Shrum, from Heritage Auctions, said: 'It may seem a little macabre but anything touched or used by a rock icon like Elvis is desirable to fans.

'It sounds mad but people love to own something like that.

Decline: Elvis pictured in the months before his death, looking overweight. In 1977 he was prescribed over 10,000 doses of strong drugs

'This pill bottle is all the more interesting and sought after because of its part in the life and death of Elvis.

'His use of drugs was such a key part of his history and ultimately they were the culprit that killed him.

'In 1976 Elvis had been touring the U.S. and was still trying to perform energetic routines but he was grossly overweight and his body couldn't cope.

'He started getting very moody and losing his temper, even when he was on stage.

'Behind the scenes things were going downhill and he would rely on drugs to control his anxiety, panic attacks and insomnia.

'The instructions on the pill bottles was to 'use as directed' which gave Elvis free reign to take as much as he wanted.

'At the same time Elvis' manager Tom Parker was trying to keep control of him and probably found it easier to do so while Elvis was taking drugs.

'In another situation these drugs may have helped Elvis but sadly they were his downfall.'

The auction will be held at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, on August 10.
