Robert Durst was denied bail in a New Orleans court room on Monday afternoon after a judge deemed him to be a potential danger to others and a likely flight risk. 

The real
estate scion, who is awaiting extradition to California to face a first-degree murder
charge, appeared on
local weapons charges in Louisiana. 

Durst, 71, who is being held in a psych prison ward, appeared in court wearing an orange jumpsuit with his head newly shaven and a surgery scar visible.

He must remain in Louisiana on local weapons charges at least until his next court date on April 2, Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell ruled.

'There is a substantial risk the defendant might flee,' Cantrell said.

Robert Durst grinned as he was escorted from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment on March 17. He was denied bail on Monday and deemed a flight risk

Prosecutors said Durst was considered a flight risk after he dumped his cell phone on the way to New Orleans with five bags, ABC reported, and was found with a latex mask and bundles of cash in small bills.

The 71-year-old, who has used aliases in the past, also had a Texas ID in a different name.

Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, did not seek bail on Monday but argued his client's arrest and the search of his hotel room earlier this month in New Orleans were improper. 

Durst's attorneys have said they plan to seek both to expedite his extradition to LA County, where he has been charged with the 2000 execution-style murder of longtime friend Susan Berman.

The lawyers will also challenge the basis for his arrest on a Los Angeles County murder warrant earlier this month in New Orleans.

The final installment of the HBO documentary, The Jinx: The
Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, broadcast evidence that Durst's
handwriting appeared to match that of Berman's likely killer.

Susan Berman was found shot execution-style outside her home in LA in 2000. Her friend, Robert Durst, was charged with her murder

The 71-year-old's voice was then captured on a
microphone saying to himself that he had 'killed them all'.

Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen
Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the
dismemberment killing of his male neighbor in Texas in 2003.

Durst is long estranged from his powerful family with its billion-dollar New York real estate holdings. 

The final HBO episode aired one day after Durst's arrest at
a hotel in New Orleans, where he was staying under an assumed
name.

He had in his possession more than $42,000 in cash, a
revolver, a stash of marijuana and a latex mask that could fit
over his neck and head, authorities have said.

He had allegedly been withdrawing $9,000-a-day for more than a month. He also had an ID with the name, Everette Ward.

FBI agents arrested Durst out of fear he would flee the
country, an FBI spokeswoman has said. 

They suggested that Durst may have been attempting to flee to Cuba, where direct, non-stop flights started from New Orleans last Saturday.

Maps of New Orleans, Florida and Cuba were found in his hotel room, The New York Times reported. 

ABC reported that agents were unable to locate Durst in New Orleans and instead bumped into him in the lobby of a hotel. 

James O'Hern, an investigator for the local district attorney's office, testified that authorities tracked Durst down after he placed two calls from a phone at the hotel to the voicemail on his personal phone.  

They also found a piece of paper in his room with a tracking number for a package that authorities later seized and found to contain $117,000, O'Hern said.

Durst faces local charges of one count of possession of a gun as a convicted felon and one count of possessing a weapon with a controlled substance.  

His lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, has expressed frustration with
the charges, saying he is eager to get Durst to California to
clear his name in Berman's killing.

Durst was transferred last week to a facility 70 miles
outside of New Orleans equipped to handle acutely mentally ill
inmates after the local sheriff's office asserted he was
suicidal, a contention his lawyers disputed.
