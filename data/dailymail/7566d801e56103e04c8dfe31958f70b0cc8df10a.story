Former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow is taking a job as a TV analyst, leading to strong speculation that his playing days are over, but he's not giving up on an unlikely return to the field just yet.

ESPN announced on Monday that Tebow, 26, has been hired as a college football analyst for their new SEC Network in a return to his Florida glory days, where he won The Heisman Trophy in 2007.

Tebow will appear on SEC Nation, a pregame show that will travel to a different campus each week after the channel launches in August, but he'll start his new duties as soon as January 6.

The former Denver Broncos and New York Jets star will take up the mike at the BCS Championship game in the first week of 2014.

His multiyear deal 'will not preclude him from continuing to pursue playing opportunities in the NFL,' ESPN said in a statement on Monday.

Tebow did not play in the league in 2013 after he was cut by the Patriots in August. In just over one season, he went from a national sensation who led the Broncos to the playoffs, to a backup, to out of the NFL.

'While I continue to pursue my dream of playing quarterback in the NFL, this is an amazing opportunity to be part of the unparalleled passion of college football and the SEC,' Tebow said in a statement.

Yet many experts were skeptical that the former star could make a successful return to NFL.

Former NFL cornerback turned ESPN analyst Eric Allen said that working at the network and continuing a pro career would be 'very difficult.'

'You can't do both,' the ex-Philadelphia Eagles, New Orleans Saints, and Oakland Raiders star added.

ESPN senior vice president Justin Connolly called Tebow an 'SEC icon with a national fan base and broad appeal.'

After winning the 2007 Heisman and two national championships for the Gators in the SEC, Tebow became one of the biggest stories in the NFL in his second season.

He went 7-1 in his first eight starts in 2011 then threw an 80-yard touchdown pass on the first play of overtime to give the Broncos a 29-23 playoff win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.

But he was still dogged by doubts about his passing ability, and Denver traded him that offseason to the New York Jets after acquiring Peyton Manning.

He languished on the bench while coach Rex Ryan ignored fans' calls for Tebow to replace a struggling Mark Sanchez. Tebow threw just eight passes, ran only 32 times and was cut last April 29.

For six weeks no team wanted him until the Patriots signed him to a low-risk, two-year contract with no guaranteed money.
