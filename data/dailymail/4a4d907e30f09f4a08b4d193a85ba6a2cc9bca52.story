Barcelona delivered one of their worst performances of the season and Lionel Messi had his first off day of the year as Luis Enrique’s team were beaten 1-0 at home by Malaga just three days before they face Manchester City.

If Manuel Pellegrini wants a masterclass in how to play Barcelona he need only look to the way his old club have played them this season. They drew 0-0 at La Rosaleda earlier in the season and never looked into too much trouble at the Camp Nou after Juanmi put them ahead on seven minutes after a mistake by Dani Alves.

Barcelona looked fragile at the back with Malaga’s lightning breaks exposing their high defensive line. They were second to everything in midfield and with Messi and Neymar strangely below par they blew their big chance to go top of La Liga.

Barcelona started brightly enough with Suarez forcing several corners but from the second Malaga broke away to score.

Carlos Kameni saved Suarez’ header and the former Espanyol keeper, booed for his ties to Barça’s Catalan rivals, set-up the first goal of the game with a long kick down the pitch.

It looked harmless enough as it dropped out of the sky with Alves underneath it. But the full-back miscontrolled it as he tried to send it back to keeper Claudio Bravo.

Malaga’s 21-year-old striker Juanmi pounced on the error and with Bravo slow to come out and cover Alves’ mistake the forward was able to slip it past him and make it 1-0.

Barça did their best to respond immediately but Kameni came out to clear an Alba cross ahead of Suarez who complained the keeper had used his elbows as both players went for the ball. Rafinha then had a shot blocked by Weligton on the line. The Barcelona midfielder was then booked for bringing down Recio as things went from bad to worse for the home side.

Barcelona were finding no way through Malaga’s two banks of four defence and the tactic of hanging high balls up for Suarez was proving food and drink to Kameni who dominated his area.

When Messi crossed from the right he did manage to keep it far enough away from the keeper but from the chance Neymar made an uncharacteristic mess of his control and the ball ran out for a goal kick.

Moments later Neymar combined brilliantly with Iniesta and his cross was bound for Messi but former Real Madrid defender Miguel Torres got to the ball first.

Suarez crossed from left but Neymar couldn’t control the ball. Then roles were reversed with Neyamr’s cross cut out before it reached Suarez. Messi, meanwhile, was mysteriously peripheral. The tactic of having him spend more time wide right this season has worked since the turn of the year but not here.

Barcelona supporters behind Kameni’s goal sang sarcastically about how much they love Ronaldo – after the League’s recent decision to charge the club for singing ‘Ronaldo is a drunk’ songs – and the Camp Nou waited for the first half equalizer, but it never came.

At times it was Malaga who looked more likely to get the game’s next goal. They were dangerous on the break with Samuel playing in Darder. He flicked the ball to Ricardo Horta and only a Bravo save stopped the second goal.

Alves then allowed Castillejo to get away from him and Pique was lucky not to have been judged to have fouled the forward as he cleared up his team-mate’s mistake.

Alves had been particularly bad but the sloppiness had spread through the team and going forward there was a complete lack of punch.

From a Messi centre Iniesta headed weakly at Kameni with the effort never looking like beating Kameni.

It was fitting that the last kick of the first half was an aimless crossfield pass from Messi that went straight to a blue and white striped shirt. From their talisman to their previously unflappable keeper Barcelona had been awful.

With no notable improvement at the start of the second period Luis Enrique sent on midfielder Ivan Rakitic. The Croatian replaced Rafinha on the hour. Suarez took the fight to Malaga but strayed offside running onto a Messi pass and was also just the wrong side of his marker when Pedro played him through with his first kick after replacing Iniesta.

As Suarez played Rakitic down the right he was flagged offside too – Malaga played the tactic well but were being helped a linesman who seemed not to agree with level being onside. Suarez was inline with the last defender as he ran onto Messi’s pass and could not believe it when the official raised his flag. When Pedro finally beat the offside trap he sent his shot into the side-netting.

With 15 minutes left Javier Mascherano replaced Alves at right back. It was hardly the substitution that was going to change the game but it was a chance to point the finger at the player whose mistake had started the whole shambles. 

This was Barcelona’s first defeat since the first game of the year when David Moyes’ Real Sociedad beat them. After that game the blame was all placed at tinkering Luis Enrique’s door. This time the buck stops squarely with the players and Manchester City’s only fear will be that they will be more determined than ever to put things right in their next game. 

Reflecting on his side's performance at the Nou Camp, Barca boss Enrique was less than impressed: 'I would go as far as to say we deserved to lose the game. 

'It’s an advantage that we have a game in just three days time and it’s a very big one.'
