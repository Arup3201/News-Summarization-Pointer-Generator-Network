Two personal assistants to Charles Saatchi complained that they were 'being treated worse than Filipino slaves' when they were confronted over alleged spending sprees on his company's credit cards, a court heard today.

Mr Saatchi, 70, will give prosecution evidence against the pair tomorrow when he is expected to be questioned about his marriage to ex-wife Nigella Lawson.

He arrived at court this afternoon but was sent home by the judge shortly afterwards, making no comment to dozens of photographers and TV crews gathered outside as he left.

The millionaire art dealer's former employees Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo are accused of spending £685,000 on the credit cards over a four-year period.

The Italian sisters went on lavish spending sprees buying designer clothes and paying for a shop till you drop trip to New York, the jury was told.

'Trivial': Mr Saatchi's accountant said he did not tell the millionaire about the credit card spending earlier because he considered it a 'trivial' matter

When they were confronted about the spending, it is alleged that Elisabetta, 41, complained that they were 'being treated worse than Filipino slaves'.

Rahul 
Gajjar, finance director for Mr Saatchi, told Isleworth Crown Court that at first 
the pair were open and apologetic about spending an average of £76,000 per month on the cards.

But
 he said that after he wrote them each a letter outlining how they would pay off their debt which they were expected to sign, they 
became 'agitated'.

'Lisa (Elisabetta)
 was against the proposal and I remember a reference to "We're being 
treated worse than Filipino slaves",' Mr Gajjar, 44, told jurors.

Mr
 Gajjar said Mr Saatchi and Miss Lawson, who divorced earlier this year, 
agreed that the sisters should continue working for them when the 
alleged offences came to light early last year.

He
 told jurors that the sisters, who earned a combined £53,000 per year, would be able to continue on their current salaries.

However, Francesca would be expected to pay back £1,000 a month, and 
Elisabetta £250.

'Slavery': Finance director Rahul Gajjar told Isleworth Crown Court yesterday that Elisabetta Grillo, 41, complained that she was being treated worse than Filipino slaves during conversations with her about credit card spending

They would also be able to live 
rent-free at a flat owned by Ms Lawson in Battersea, central London, the
 court heard. But Mr Gajjar said the defendants reacted angrily to this.

'They were absolutely in disagreement,' he said. 'They felt it tied them to the company for the rest of their lives.'

Anthony Metzer QC, defending Elisabetta, told the court it was common practice for other personal assistants to spend thousands on luxury goods for themselves.

Miss Lawson's other PAs - Anzelle Wasserman, Zoe Wales, 
and Alice Binks - all used the credit cards to fund the purchases.

Mr Metzer said they notched up bills running into the thousands at Annabel's, a private members club popular with the Royal family. They also spent money on Christian Louboutin shoes, wedding parties, and sprees at Babington House.

He said: 'The position about all the other personal assistants is precisely the same in relation to the type of expenditure they incurred as to the other PAs in this case.'

Jurors were told that other personal assistants were not investigated.

Mr Metzer insisted that Elisabetta and her sister believed they were allowed to spend the cash.

He said: 'Unbeknown to you they believed that they were authorised to incur this personal expenditure, and suddenly you were saying they were not.'

The
 accountant had not initially bothered to tell Mr Saatchi and Miss 
Lawson about the pair's credit card spending when he first 
uncovered it last year because he didn't want to trouble him with 'trivial matters', the jury heard.

Asked
 by prosecutor Jane Carpenter why he did not go straight to them with his suspicions, he said: 'It was on the back 
burner.

'We were dealing 
with more corporate matters - more serious corporate matters - and Mr 
Saatchi and Miss Lawson normally didn't have time for what we thought 
were trivial matters.'

The jury was told Francesca's average 
monthly spend was £48,000 while Elisabetta's was £28,000 - compared with
 the other personal assistants who spent a maximum of £8,000.

The jury was told that Miss Lawson spent £7,000 per month on her credit card on average.

The average monthly outgoings of Mr Saatchi's household, including 
the two sisters, three other personal assistants and Nigella, amounted 
to £100,000 a month - the equivalent of £1.2million a year, the court 
heard.

Francesca, 35,
 ran up a £64,000 bill in June last year and her expenditure included over 
£4,700 on flights to New York, where she spent £1,850 at high-end 
fashion store Miu Miu.

Hotel in New York (left) in June last year, the court heard. She also 
used the credit card the same month to pay a £1,280 bill at the Ritz 
hotel in Paris on the day she bought a Chloe dress for £723, it is 
alleged

'Spending spree': Elisabetta spent thousands of 
pounds on designer clothes from Calvin Klein at Harrods (left) and 
Harvey Nichols (right), both in central London

Jurors were told that she had paid £613 at the Soho House Hotel in New York on June 3, and two days later had shelled out £1,424 at the 
Gansevoort Hotel.

In addition, she also withdrew large 
amounts of cash while she stayed in the city.

Later
 that month, she used the card to pay a £1,280 bill at the Ritz hotel in
 Paris on the same day she bought a Chloe dress for £723.

And on June 12 she spent £5,385 at Miu Miu London and £2,650 at designer store Prada.

Her sister, Elisabetta, spent thousands on designer clothes from
 Calvin Klein at department stores Harrods and Harvey Nichols.

Over the course of a four-year period she splurged £58,744 in just 50 transactions at an array of designer shops and spas.

Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Marc Jacobs and Calvin Klein were just some of the luxury brands that the money was spent on.

Mr
 Gajjar told the court he met with the sisters in the kitchen of the Saatchi 
family home in west London, on July 3 last year to examine their credit 
card statements.

He said
 Francesca explained that some of the transactions were for payments on 
behalf of her employers, some she was not sure of and others were 
personal.

'She admitted 
that they were for her own use, her personal expenditure, which she was 
slightly apologetic about and vowed to reimburse the company or 
Charles,' Mr Gajjar said.

Charles Saatchi, 70, are both set to give prosecution evidence against their two former PAs

Claims: TV cook Nigella Lawson is expected to give evidence to the court next Wednesday against her former employees

Mr
 Gajjar said both defendants had been given credit cards in Saatchi's 
Conarco Partnership account with Coutt's bank to buy items for the 
household.

Jurors heard Elisabetta began working 
for Miss Lawson as a nanny in 1999 while the TV chef was married to 
journalist John Diamond.

Mr
 Gajjar told the court that Francesca also lived with the Lawson family 
as a 'housemate' before their roles began to change in around 2006.

He said: 'Between 2006 and 2008 their roles had changed and they were doing more corporate stuff.

'I then got a call to put the Grillos on the Conarco payroll - a call from Nigella Lawson'.

The
 court heard that the Grillos' heavy spending on the Conarco credit 
cards actually came out of Saatchi's personal bank account at Coutts, 
rather than his business' account.

Mr
 Gajjar added that his role as Conarco's finance director meant he was 
unable to scrutinise the Grillos' expenditure and the Saatchi and Lawson
 family's private outgoings.

Referring
 to Conarco credit card statements, Mr Gajjar said: 'These items were 
for the family and it wasn't in my capacity to say whether this Chanel 
handbag was okay or not okay.

'It wasn't me to say that Nigella can't have a £25,000 dress.

'These expenses were personal and not part of the Conarco business - it was Charles and Nigella using their cards'.

Concerns
 were finally raised about the sisters' spending spree when Francesca's 
outgoings regularly hit over £40,000 every month.

Thanks to supporters: As Saatchi was arriving at court today, Nigella tweeted a recipe on Twitter

Mr Saatchi
 and the TV chef broke up after pictures were published in a newspaper 
showing him holding his wife of 10 years by the throat.

It is alleged that between January 1 
2008 and December 31 2012, the sisters committed fraud by abusing their 
positions as PAs by using a company credit card for personal gain.

The Grillos, both of Bayswater, west London, deny the charges against them.

Today's proceedings were moved to a larger courtroom due to the huge press interest in the case.

Miss Lawson is expected to give evidence in the trial at a later date, however as Saatchi was arriving at court today, the cook tweeted a recipe on Twitter for Butternut Squash with Pecans and Blue Cheese.

The case was adjourned until tomorrow.
