Welcome to Ellison Isle: Larry Ellison owns all but a tiny fraction of Lanai, Hawaii's smallest publicly accessible island

Larry Ellison has long been known as an avid collector of the finer things in life. He's even been called a real estate collector, including hundreds of millions worth of property in elite Malibu, California.

The software magnate quietly purchased up to  mansions for $250 million, including 12 homes along the coveted Carbon Beach - known locally as 'billionaires beach,' MailOnline reported in May 2013.

Buying out the neighbors: Ellison purchased this modern mansion in 2012. It was his ninth property on the Malibu beach called 'Billionaire's row' 

The only man in the neighborhood: The Malibu 'billionaire's beach' properties dotted in red are believed to owned, or previously owned, by Ellison 

All to himself: The homes on 'billionaire's beach' come with their own private ocean front, void of plebians

Ellison also owns all but a tiny percentage of Lanai, Hawaii's smallest accessible public island.

Just this summer, he clenched a deal making him the owner of all the islands hotels. 

The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported the deal to buy the historic Hotel Lanai that closed in July made Ellison the owner of every hotel room on the island.

Finer things: Later purchased by David Geffen, the 138-meter yacht The Rising Sun was custom built for Ellison in 2004

Mary Charles’ business owned and operated the hotel in Lanai City since 2007. She tells the Maui News that she believes most of the 28 hotel staffers remain employed at the 10-room hotel.

Ellison’s company Pulama Lanai confirmed the deal but declined further comment. The sale price is undisclosed.

The Oracle Corp. CEO purchased 98 percent of Lanai in 2012, including the two other hotels on the island.

Hotel Lanai is less expensive than the two upscale resorts. It was built in 1923 for Dole Plantation executives.

Moving out: Ellison sold this stunning Lake Tahoe home for $20.35million this past July, property records show

'The three of us have been working well together for the last several years, and we plan to continue working together for the foreseeable future. Keeping this management team in place has always been a top priority of mine.' 

The shake-up nevertheless opens a new phase in Oracle's history. The Redwood Shores, California, company is trying to adapt to the technological upheaval that is causing more of its corporate customers to lease software applications stored in remote data centers instead of paying licensing fees to install programs on machines kept in their own offices.

Before their promotions, Catz and Hurd were Oracle's co-presidents and had been working closely with Ellison for years. Catz is a former investment banker, while Hurd is best known as the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Co.

Hurd stepped down from HP four years ago after that company's board raised questions about his expense report. Ellison ridiculed HP for its treatment of Hurd, a close friend, and hired him at Oracle.
