Flights are returning to normal after a strike by Italian air traffic controllers caused major disruptions for thousands of holidaymakers today.  

The four-hour work stoppage forced Ryanair to ground 96 flights to and from Italy, including four return services to and from the UK.

EasyJet cancelled up to 60 flights and as many as 20 of them were into and out of the UK.

Grounded: Ryanair has cancelled almost 100 of its flights due to a strike by air traffic controllers in Italy

British Airways flights were also affected by the strike, which lasted from 11:30am to 3:30pm UK time.

Before the air traffic controllers returned to work, a BA spokeswoman said: 'We are doing all we can to minimise disruption to customers affected by the threatened strike.' 

BA opted to cancel or re-time some of its flights and use larger aircraft to accommodate passengers whose flights were cancelled.

Passengers were told that further delays and cancellations are possible and they should check the status of their flight.

A BA spokesman later added: ‘There were a number of cancellations. A number of flights were put back until after the strike, but as soon as the strike ended, the intention was to get them into the air, and that is happening now.’

Ryanair's cancellations included its Manchester-Bologna, Stansted-Ancona, Stansted-Trieste and Liverpool-Pisa routes.

The budget airline's Robin Kiely said: 'We sincerely apologise to all passengers who have had their travel plans disrupted by these unjustified ATC strikes.'

EasyJet said: 'We are doing everything possible to minimise the impact to our customers and we are offering anyone flying to and from Italy during those times the opportunity to transfer their flight free of charge to another day to avoid the strike.'
