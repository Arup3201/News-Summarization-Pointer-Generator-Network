Republican presidential front-runner Mitt Romney was today targeted by gay-rights activists who 'glitter bombed' him on the campaign trail - twice.

The unusual form of protest is usually deployed against politicians who oppose gay marriage. After one attack Mr Romney said: 'I've got glitter in my hair. That's not all I got in my hair. I glue it down every morning.'

He was earlier left red-faced hours after his victory in the Florida primary when he said he's 'not concerned about the very poor' because they have an 'ample safety net.'

Glitterbomb: Mitt Romney was targeted by gay-rights activists on the campaign trail in Minnesota

Protest: But the candidate laughed off the attack and said: 'That's not all I got in my hair. I glue it down every morning'

As the day began, the former 
Massachusetts governor told CNN from Florida: 'I'm not concerned about 
the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I'll fix 
it. I'm not concerned about the very rich. They're doing just fine. I'm 
concerned about the very heart of America, the 90-95 percent of 
Americans who right now are struggling.'

'You can focus on the very poor, that's not my focus,' he said.

Democrats and Republicans alike pounced and the GOP front-runner's comments as Mr Romney quickly sought to explain his remarks.

President Barack Obama's re-election campaign was quick to criticize.

'So much for 'we're all in this together,' tweeted Obama campaign manager Jim Messina.

'No, no, no, no, no, no, no,' Romney 
told reporters on his campaign plane when asked about the comments. 'No,
no, no. You've got to take the whole sentence, all right, it's mostly 
the same.' He said his remark was consistent with his theme throughout 
the race, adding: 'My energy is going to be devoted to helping 
middle-income people.'

Rich and poor: Mr Romney's comments will have extra resonance with his opponents as he has a personal fortune of $250m which may claim make him unsuited to understanding the needs of ordinary Americans

Despite attempting to explain himself, Mr Romney's comments quickly became an immediate distraction from his message that he's more conservative than chief rival Newt Gingrich and from the double-digit thumping the former House speaker sustained in Florida. His campaign worked behind the scenes to provide context for the comment.

Some conservative pundits also labeled it a gaffe and said it was evidence Mr Romney wasn't prepared to run against Obama.

'The issue here is not that Romney is right or wrong, but that he is handing choice sound bites to the Democrats to make him as unlikeable as he made Newt Gingrich,' said Erick Erickson on the conservative RedState blog. And Jonah Goldberg at the conservative National Review Online said of Romney: 'Every time he seems to get into his groove and pull away he says things that make people think he doesn't know how to play the game.'

With criticism mounting, Romney flew 
to Minnesota and addressed a rally before heading to Nevada. He also 
boasted in flight about his 'huge' Florida victory.

Mr Romney, whose central challenge is winning over sceptical conservatives, told reporters on the plane that the fact that he performed strongly among conservatives in Florida made sense because he's more conservative than Gingrich.

'I'm not saying he's not conservative. I'm just saying he's not the pure conservative he would have people believe, and I think folks in Florida saw through that," Romney said. His campaign also started airing a radio ad in Colorado on Wednesday that says "conservatives across America are supporting Mitt Romney.'

But Mr Romney was immediately was forced to clarify his comments about the poor.

Asked whether his words might strike some as odd, Mr Romney said: 'We will hear from the Democrat party the plight of the poor and there's no question, it's not good being poor, and we have a safety net to help those that are very poor.' Mr Romney added that he's more worried about the unemployed, people living on Social Security and those struggling to send their kids to college.

'We have a very ample safety net and we can talk about whether it needs to be strengthened or whether there are holes in it. But we have food stamps, we have Medicaid, we have housing vouchers, we have programs to help the poor,' Mr Romney said. "But the middle-income Americans, they're the folks that are really struggling right now.'

Optimistic: Newt Gingrich was focusing on the future after his setback in Florida

Mr Romney has broached the subject of the poor repeatedly on the campaign trail but until Wednesday had been more careful in his choice of words.

'I worry about the very poor and I want to make sure that our safety net is there,' Mr Romney said in New Hampshire in December, says the middle class are "the people I'm really concerned about right now.'

Wednesday wasn't the first time that Mr Romney, who made millions working in private equity, has been accused of insensitivity on matters of wealth. He once said 'I like being able to fire people' when talking about having the ability to choose service providers. He also has declared that he knew what it was like to worry about being 'pink-slipped' out of a job.

The gaffe will come as a bitter blow to Mr Mitt Romney who romped home to an overwhelming victory in the Florida primary, re-establishing himself as the clear frontrunner in the Republican battle to face President Barack Obama in November.

The former Massachusetts governor 
took a 14-point lead on 46 per cent, with Newt Gingrich on 32 per cent, 
Rick Santorum trailing on 13 per cent and Ron Paul in fourth with seven 
per cent.

In his victory 
speech in Tampa, Mr Romney congratulated his opponents on ‘another 
hard-fought contest’ and said that ‘the three gentlemen left are serious
and able competitors’.

But his main target was Mr Obama. He 
launched a blistering attack on the President and promised to 'end the 
Obama era and begin a new era of American prosperity' after years of 
economic decline.

'Mr President, you were elected to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time to get out of the way.’

He added: ‘Three years ago this week,
a newly elected President Obama faced the American people and said that
if he couldn’t turn the economy around in three years, he’d be looking 
at a one-term proposition,’ he said. ‘We’re here to collect.’

The drubbing of Mr Gingrich, the shock
victor in South Carolina 10 days ago, will put pressure on him to 
abandon his White House bid but the former House Speaker shows no sign 
of giving up yet.

Mitt Romney - 46% (771,842 votes)

Newt Gingrich - 32% (531, 294)

Rick Santorum - 13% (222,248)

Ron Paul - 7% (116,776)

Mr Gingrich was surrounded by volunteers holding 
‘46 States to Go’ signs as he delivered a defiant address in Orlando. He
did not mention Mr Romney by name and barely acknowledged he had lost 
as he vowed: ‘We are going to contest every place and we are going to 
win and we are going to be in Tampa as the nominee in August.’

In a 
rallying cry for conservatives to unite behind him, he said: ‘It is now 
clear that this will be a two-person race between the conservative 
leader Newt Gingrich and the Massachusetts moderate, and the voters of 
Florida really made that clear,’ He pledged to ‘have people power beat 
money power in the next six months’.

Mr Gingrich’s second place 
showing, clearly ahead of Mr Santorum, the Iowa victor, and maverick 
libertarian congressman Mr Paul, will bolster his case that he is the 
only conservative alternative to Mr Romney. Mr Gingrich has already 
called for Mr Santorum to pull out and endorse him.

Mr Romney’s 
Florida victory gives him all 50 of the state’s convention delegates. 
His advisers were exultant at registering a landslide margin greater 
than the 13 per cent achieved by Mr Gingrich in South Carolina.

Given
that Mr Gingrich led in the polls after South Carolina, the Romney 
campaign hopes that the win in Florida, where Mr Romney lost to John 
McCain in the 2008 primary, will cement their message that he is now 
almost invincible.

After the four successive contests in Iowa, New 
Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida, the Republican race now becomes a
much more national affair – a significant advantage for the richer and 
better-organised Mr Romney, the long-time party establishment choice.
