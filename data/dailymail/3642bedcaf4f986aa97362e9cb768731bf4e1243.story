Leading gay Tory businessman Ivan Massow is to have a baby with a lesbian couple.

The millionaire entrepreneur met the two women through a website which puts potential parents in touch with each other.

A high-profile gay rights campaigner, Mr Massow is expecting to become a father in August.

The 47-year-old said: 'I'm really excited. It's strange knowing you are going to become a father. It gives me a sense of peace. It completely changes your relationship with the world.

'I've wanted to do this for such a long time I thought if I don't do it now I'll probably be too old.'

Mr Massow, who plans to succeed Boris Johnson as London Mayor in 2016, added: 'I know the situation is odd. But I thought 'go for it'.'

The baby will be brought up predominantly by the two women, who are in their 30s and live in Croydon, South London. Mr Massow lives in a large Georgian townhouse in Bloomsbury, Central London, which has a separate flat that the two women and their child can use.

'I'll be helping with nappy changing, I guess,' said Mr Massow, who has fostered children in the past.

He added: 'I went down the internet route, because I didn't want some mock relationship with friends. Those relationships fall to pieces sometimes.

'I wanted to start with a matter-of-fact agreement and build a rock-solid friendship. And this way the child has two mothers.'

A self-confessed 'Thatcher's child' and former key adviser to William Hague, Mr Massow was the official escort of Margaret Thatcher at the 1999 Conservative Party Conference.

He is a former chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, who made his millions in financial services, starting with less than £5,000.
