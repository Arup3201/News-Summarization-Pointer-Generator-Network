Tottenham are hopeful Nacer Chadli is winning his race time to be fit for Saturday's crunch clash against Manchester City.

The Belgium international has returned to the club's Enfield HQ after sustaining a hip injury whilst on international duty.

Manager Mauricio Pochettino doesn't want to rule Chadli, one of his key performers so far this season, out of the clash against City.

Spurs medical staff are making daily checks on the forward, the club's top goalscorer this season with four goals, in a bid to get him fit for the trip to the Etihad Stadium.

Tottenham are hopeful the forward will prove his fitness ahead of the clash against the champions - but will leave a decision on his availability as late as possible.

It is understood Chadli first felt the hip problem during the closing stages of the win over Southampton.

Chadli has scored four times for Spurs this season, topping the club's scoring charts in the Premier League

He was deemed fit enough to play against Andorra last Friday, but was ruled out of the draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina on Monday night.

Belgium's medical team are confident the injury isn't serious, but Tottenham want to make their own assessment before making a decision on his availability for Saturday.
