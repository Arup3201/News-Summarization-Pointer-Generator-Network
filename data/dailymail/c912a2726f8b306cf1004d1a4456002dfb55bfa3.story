One of Britain's best-loved post-war screen sirens died after a TV fell on her as she suffered a suspected heart attack, an inquest heard.

Jean Kent appeared in 45 films and starred alongside Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier in the 1957 romantic comedy The Prince and the Showgirl.

She was 92 when she was found last November in the bedroom of her home in Westhorpe, near Stowmarket, Suffolk.

Ms Kent specialised in playing femme fatales, and throughout the 1940s and 50s she was regularly voted among the top ten most popular British stars.

An inquest heard she was found unconscious and lying on the floor at 11.30am by her friend and housekeeper Rita Betts, who had 
worked for her for more than 15 years.

The
 housekeeper described finding Ms Kent with the TV stand still lying 
across the right-hand side of her body with the TV on the floor next to 
her.

Ms Kent, real name Joan Hurst, was rushed to West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds, but died two days later on November 30.

The
 inquest heard her room was found in 'considerable disarray' and police 
launched a five-day forensic investigation amid fears intruders had 
broken into her home.

But 
they decided no crime had been committed, and a post mortem found the 
actress suffered a blunt force trauma injury to her chest.

It fractured her ribs and caused severe bruising to her chest and arms.

Tests showed she was also suffering from cardiac disease, which may have caused a heart attack.

Pathologist
 Dr Sheila Purdy, who carried out the post mortem, said Ms Kent's death 'resulted from chest injuries preceded by a cardiac event which resulted
 in the fall.'

Recording a 
narrative verdict, Suffolk coroner Dr Peter Dean said: 'She died from accidental injury from a fall occurring 
against a background of significant pre-existing cardiac disease which 
may have precipitated it [the fall].'

Born Joan Summerfield in Brixton, south London on June 29, 1921, Ms Kent was the only child of variety performers Norman Field and Nina Norre and started her career in 1931 as a dancer.

She used the stage name 'Jean Carr' when she appeared as a chorus girl in the Windmill Theatre in London, and signed to Gainsborough Pictures during the Second World War.

The turning point in her career came when she was given a part in the 1945 film Fanny by Gaslight. She appeared in several British films before turning to TV shows including Lovejoy and Steptoe and Son.

In 1961 she played Queen Elizabeth I in an ITV series on the life of Sir Francis Drake.

She met her husband Jusuf Ramart on the set of one of her best-known films, Caravan, and they married in April 1946. He died from cancer in 1989.

She made her last public appearance in June 2011, when she was honoured by the British Film Institute on her 90th birthday.
