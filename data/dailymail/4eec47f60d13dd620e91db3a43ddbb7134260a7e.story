Hannah Smith, 14, was found dead after being the target of anonymous trolls on the internet site Ask.FM

As they grow in popularity Twitter and other social media platforms are increasingly associated with cyber bullying, and in some extreme cases teen suicide.

Cases such as Hannah Smith, the 
14-year-old from Lutterworth, Leicestershire, who hanged herself after 
suffering abuse online on the site Ask.fm, have highlighted the dangers of social media.

But demonstrating the more positive power of social media, in August a 
Canadian teenager who tweeted about planning to commit suicide was 
helped by concerned internet users from all over the world - potentially
saving her life.

And now new research has shown that Twitter reflects trends in suicide surprisingly accurately and as such could be harnessed as a preventative force.

Researchers at the Brigham Young University, Utah, found the number of ‘suicidal tweets’ in each area strongly correlated with the real suicide rate.

They examined millions of tweets in America over a three month period and found the rate of worrying tweets in each state strongly correlated with that states actual suicide rate.

The researchers found 37,717 troubling tweets, which mentioned suicide or key words associated with bullying which is known to be a risk factor, from 28,088 users over the three months. 

In the state of Alaska alone the team identified 61 at risk individuals form their tweets.

Alaska also has the highest suicide rate in the USA.

As Twitter generally provides at least state, or county information for each user, as well as enabling direct messaging to users, the researchers suggest that having this knowledge could be used to help prevent suicide in the future.

An anguished tweet from a teenager in Calgary sparked action from fellow Twitter users, demonstrating the positive power of social media

Christophe Giraud-Carrier, one of  the study’s authors says : ‘With social media, kids sometimes say things that they aren't saying out loud to an adult or friend in person.

‘Somebody ought to do something. How about using social media as a complement to what is already done for suicide prevention?’

Another of the study’s authors Michael Barnes says: ‘Tweets may be useful to address some of the functions that suicide hotline groups perform, but at the discretion and potential for such organizations to provide those services via Twitter.’

The team also hope to develop an app for more private forms of social media, which aims to single out worrying content such as statuses.

The app would be used in conjunction with schools and students would have to give their permission for their information to be accessed.

Algorithms would be used to analyze all content posted by students and alert the school to any potential issues before the student reached a crisis point.
