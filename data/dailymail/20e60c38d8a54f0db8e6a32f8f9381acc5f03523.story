The killing of a country vicar has been linked to the murder of a widow following the arrest of a ‘dangerous’ suspect, police said yesterday.

The Rev John Suddards was killed in his home six weeks after the body of Betty Yates was discovered at her secluded riverside cottage. Both had been stabbed.

A police spokesman confirmed that the murders, which took place about 60 miles apart, had been ‘formally linked’ after Stephen Farrow, 47, was  arrested early yesterday. On Saturday, detectives issued an urgent appeal to help find Farrow, who was described as a ‘dangerous’ suspect who exploits the charity of the church.

They warned the public not to approach him under any circumstances and instead to dial 999.Mr Suddards, 59, was found stabbed to death in St Mary’s vicarage in the market town of Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, last Tuesday. The clergyman had admitted to his congregation that welcoming strangers was a ‘risky’ part of his job.

Similarities: Betty Yates was found stabbed to death at her home in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on January 2

Mrs Yates, 77, was beaten with her own walking stick and stabbed in the neck at her isolated home in Bewdley, Worcestershire on January 2.

The retired teacher’s body was found two days later. She had lived in the cottage on the banks of the River Severn for more than 30 years.

A spokesman for West Mercia Police said Farrow was being transferred into the custody of officers investigating Mr Suddards’s death following his arrest in Folkestone, Kent.

Detective Chief Inspector Neil Jamieson of West Mercia Police, which is investigating the case of Mrs Yates, said: ‘We would like to thank Avon and Somerset Police for their help in our investigation. We have been working with them to examine similarities between the deaths of Betty Yates and the Reverend John Suddards.’

He had said earlier of the Betty Yates investigation: ‘We will continue our unrelenting efforts to bring the offender responsible for this dreadful crime to justice.’

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Crisp of Avon and Somerset Police, who is leading the investigation into Mr Suddards’s murder, praised those who had contributed to Farrow’s arrest.

‘I would like to thank the public and all those who have helped us to find him,’ he said. ‘It was as a direct result of assistance from a member of the public that we were able to locate this man and we would like to express our sincere thanks and gratitude.’

He had said of Farrow earlier in the weekend: ‘His favoured form of transport is the bus although we cannot exclude other types of public transport, or hitchhiking or walking.

‘We know that he would seek shelter in a tent that he has with him or he may purchase. Crucially, he may also seek to exploit the charity of the church community.’

The community of Thornbury has been shattered by the death

Farrow is said to have used a variety of names and travelled extensively across the UK. He was arrested two days  after about 300 people attended a special service in Thornbury to remember Mr Suddards.

The former barrister had been at the parish for just seven months, but had worked as a vicar for 22 years.

The Bishop of Gloucester,  the Right Reverend Michael Perham, paid tribute to a ‘good man and faithful minister’.

Farrow’s is a second arrest following the vicar’s death. On the day Mr Suddards’s body was discovered, a 43-year-old man was arrested and questioned before being released on bail.

Earlier this month, a man was arrested and questioned by police investigating the murder of Mrs Yates. He was later released on bail.

Forensic teams were called in after Mr Suddards was found soon after 10am on Monday

Last month, Mrs Yates’s son and daughter made an emotional appeal for help to bring their mother’s killer to justice.

Appearing with her brother David Yates, Hazel Costello said: ‘We are completely bewildered as to who could carry out such a savage attack on our mother. That this should have happened in her home makes this even more difficult to bear.’

Anyone with information about either of the killings should call Avon and Somerset or West Mercia Police on 101.
