Media tycoon Alexander Lebedev – the pro-Western owner of The Independent and London Evening Standard newspapers – has been targeted by Russian authorities again, with his bank accused of evading at least £6.2 million in tax.

Last week his National Reserve Bank was searched and documents removed by armed police and officials from the powerful Russian Investigative Committee, which is headed by Alexander Bastrykin, a former classmate of President Vladimir Putin.

Lebedev, 54, has faced previous legal problems and friends fear that he is being targeted for political reasons as a backer of an independent investigative newspaper in Russia.

According to Lebedev, the whole sum in dispute has been paid, and he says this makes the raid even more likely to be revenge or a personal attack by the authorities.

‘Apparently, they decided to increase the pressure,’ Lebedev said, complaining the search was conducted without a court order.

A spokesman for the investigation said: ‘The bank leadership committed tax evasion amounting to over 380 million roubles in 2011. The bank’s assets worth the unpaid taxes have been frozen. 

'To identify the individuals involved, documents about the bank’s operations in 2011 are seized.’

Bank officials found guilty could face up to six years in jail or a large fine
