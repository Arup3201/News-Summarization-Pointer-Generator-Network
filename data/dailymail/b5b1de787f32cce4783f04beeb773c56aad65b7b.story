Penis-shaped lollies have been taken off the shelves in New Zealand after a local father complained that they were 'offensive'.

Barrie Aburn, from Dunedin on the South Island, was surprised when the mixed bag of lollies his young daughters bought him as a birthday present contained the lewd confectionery.

Mr Aburn's partner Jacqui Hawkins was the first to notice them when she picked one randomly out of the bag of Dragon Sweets, The New Zealand Herald reported.

'I don't find anything amusing about it at all. I find it disgusting,' she said.

The bag also contained gummy babies with penises.

The Dragon Sweets were imported from China six weeks ago by confectionery company Dutch Rusk.

Dutch Rusk managing director Willem Van de Geest said 7200 bags of mixed gummy lollies were distributed around the South Island, but said he was unaware they contained the inappropriate sweets. They have since been recalled.

'You have to look at it two or three times to think that doesn't look right,' Mr Van de Geest said.

He apologised to Mr Aburn and said it was a one-off occurrence that wouldn't happen again.

Mr Van de Geest added that the lollies would not be considered offensive in Asia, where the shape is a sign of health and fertility.

'They wouldn't even blink an eyelid. We see it as offensive. We don't mind a hand or a foot being part of a lolly but we object to a breast or a penis,' he said.
