Fears: Esme Smith, 14, vanished after travelling to London ten days ago

A schoolgirl missing in London for ten days may have made a secret arrangement to meet someone in the capital, her family have said.

Esme Smith, 14, vanished after travelling to central London on Thursday September 12 from her home in Farnham, Surrey, and fears for her safety are growing daily.

Her elder sister Sian, 19, said in a video appeal asking Esme to get in touch: ‘I think maybe she’s met somebody out there or planned to meet somebody, we don’t know at the moment – that’s the most worrying thing. We’re incredibly worried.’

Her father Mark Smith, a former Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander who now works at Nato’s Joint Warfare Centre in Norway, said: ‘We’re worried sick. She’s just gone to ground. We’re baffled.’

Esme was last seen by friends after school in Farnham on the Thursday afternoon, where she told them she was going to Woking – 16 miles away – and then to a party.

Instead, she changed out of her school uniform and caught a  train from Aldershot just after  4pm, arriving at London’s Waterloo station about an hour later. Detectives have released a CCTV image showing her walking down steps near Charing Cross station at  about 5.30pm.

Her family’s concerns came as it emerged that Esme may have posted disturbing messages about casual sex when she was aged just 13 on notorious website ask.fm, which allows users to ask each other questions with the option of anonymity.

The site has been implicated in several cases in which cyberbullying has led to suicide.

In a question and answer session last October under Esme’s name, with a photograph which appeared to be her, she was asked if she would ‘ever consider friends with benefits?’ (a euphemism for casual sex).

She answered ‘Yes’. When asked by her anonymous inquisitor with whom, she answered ‘A few guys, inbox [message] me who you are.’

She then added: ‘Well I go for older guys, sooo .  .  . ’

It has also emerged that the 14-year-old was bullied on the site. She was called 'a f****** dog' and a slut by internet trolls, according to The Sunday Mirror.

And one mocking message questioned her popularity at her school, All Hallows Catholic School.

According to the paper it said 'your not liked at all hallows at all haaa'.

Esme’s best friend, who asked to be known only by her first name, Jenny, has tweeted a picture of them both, saying: ‘I miss my best friend, I pray every minute that she is  safe. I’m trying to stay positive. #FindEsme.’

Jenny’s father said his daughter and Esme had been friends since the age of three.

‘We have known her almost all her life. Jenny is terribly worried and she just wants to know Esme is safe and misses her.

'She’s been on holiday with us and stayed over a lot, and we just want her back.

'Every time she has been here all we hear is laughter. She’s always happy and bubbly.’

He said neither he nor his daughter had any idea why Esme had travelled to London, adding: ‘We haven’t seen much of her because we’ve been away for most of the summer. We’re just really shocked.

‘What makes it even worse, is  that she was last seen leaving  Charing Cross and going to Villiers Street, and my office is on  Villiers Street.’ 

Esme Smith, 14, has not been seen since getting the train to London to go to a party more than a week ago
