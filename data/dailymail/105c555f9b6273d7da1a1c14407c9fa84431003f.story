A lonely police worker who became addicted to Nurofen Plus for her back pain died after taking a cocktail of illegal drugs.

Nikola Bradford, 36, became so hooked on the over-the-counter tablets that she tried to kick her habit by urging local chemists not to sell them to her, an inquest heard.

But the communications officer became depressed that she was single and working unsociable hours while friends were settling down and starting families, and began travelling to nearby towns to buy the pills, her mother revealed.

Miss Bradford was eventually admitted to hospital after taking 32 of the tablets, which can become addictive because they contain codeine as well as ibuprofen.

She recovered, but just days later she inexplicably took a fatal overdose of cocaine, amphetamines and Ecstasy, the inquest heard.

She had begun taking painkillers for migraines in her teens, the hearing was told, and was badly affected by the loss of her father in a road accident in 2001.

Toxicology tests showed Miss Bradford had large amounts of cocaine in her system and had also taken  amphetamines and ecstasy

Her troubles with Nurofen Plus began after the breakdown of a relationship in 2005 and a fall down stairs in 2010, after which she required surgery on fractured vertebrae.

Her mother, Dianne Westwell, told the hearing she had lost friends because of the unsociable hours she worked in her job with Greater Manchester Police.

‘That was half her problem – a lot of her friends were married with children and she found it very difficult with the work pattern she had to go out with friends,’ she said.

‘She was very lonely. She complained of back pain quite often.’

On November 21 last year one of her daughter’s colleagues called her to say Miss Bradford was

‘unsteady on her feet and didn’t appear herself’.

Mrs Westwell said: ‘She looked like she was drunk. She was slurring her words. She said she hadn’t taken any tablets but from her demeanour it was obvious.’

An empty 32-pill packet of Nurofen Plus was found in Miss Bradford’s bag. She was admitted to hospital, where she was diagnosed with a kidney problem and told to stop taking ibuprofen.

Mrs Westwell said her daughter seemed ‘happy’ when she saw her on November 27.

But three days later she failed to respond to an invitation to Sunday lunch and her body was found at her Bolton home.

Her sister Erika told the inquest how, in the run-up to the tragedy, she had told her sister to ‘sort herself out’ as the pair argued by text message.

Miss Bradford was so addicted to Nurofen that she asked her local chemists to stop selling them to her

‘She had told the chemist in the past when she had wanted to stop [taking Nurofen] not to serve her,’ she said.

‘When she went back to taking it that’s when she would travel because everyone locally knew not to sell it.’

According to Miss Bradford’s family, she used to take both Nurofen – which only contains ibuprofen – and Nurofen Plus.

Toxicology tests showed that she had not taken Nurofen on the day of her death but that there were fatal levels of cocaine, and she had taken amphetamines and Ecstasy.

Many popular pills taken for headaches, sore backs, migraines and period pain contain codeine, a powerful painkiller from the same family of drugs as heroin and morphine.

It makes people feel relaxed, so even if the pain has gone, some people will keep taking it for the calming effect – leading them to become addicted.

It is available without prescription in low doses and can be combined with paracetamol or ibuprofen – as in Nurofen plus. Side-effects of codeine range from drowsiness and dizziness to fits and heart rhythm problems.

With 25million packs of painkillers containing codeine sold over the counter each year in the UK, it is feared that tens of thousands of people could be addicted to tablets such as Nurofen Plus, Panadol Ultra, Migraleve and other tablets available without prescription.

Young, female professionals are believed to be particularly vulnerable.

Packs are limited to 32 tablets, contain warnings about addiction and can only be sold under the supervision of a pharmacist.

Ibuprofen, the second ingredient in Nurofen Plus, is also not without risk. Side-effects include indigestion, stomach ulcers and an increased risk of stroke and heart attack. It should not be taken by anyone with kidney problems.

The family were unaware she was using illegal drugs as well.

Coroner Alan Walsh recorded that her death was as a result of drug misuse but said mystery surrounded how she had obtained illicit drugs.

Recording a narrative verdict at the hearing in Bolton, he said: ‘She found relief in pain by taking Nurofen, it is available over the counter and she became quite addicted.

‘It’s sad that she felt the need to take these illicit drugs.’

NHS guidelines and information on packets advise against taking Nurofen Plus for more than three days in a row as the codeine makes it addictive.
