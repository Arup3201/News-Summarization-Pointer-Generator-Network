A secret arsenal of guns and ammunition hidden in the wake of the Dunblane massacre have been found stashed behind a false wall by a builder renovating a house.

Builder Simon Berni, 41, was shocked to discover a secret haul of more than 30 shotguns and pistols as well as hundreds of rounds of ammunition when he began working on a south Wales property.

He said: 'It was an incredible arsenal - full, absolutely choc-a-bloc with eight shelves of fire arms and ammunition.'

The haul: It is believed a previous owner of the property in Dinas Powys, South Wales, stashed these guns behind the wall after the Dunblane massacre in 1996

Well hidden: The secret compartment was only discovered when Mr Berni started renovating the property

Investigation: Police safety removed the collection of firearms from the property

Police were today investigating the gun stash uncovered in a semi-detached in a quiet village in south Wales.

The guns were wrapped in newspaper dated March 1996 - just days after the Dunblane massacre in which 16 children were shot dead.

Police believe the guns were 
unregistered and their owner hid them out of fear of losing them when 
strict new firearms laws were brought in following the Dunblane 
shootings.

The country was left in horrified shock after Thomas Hamilton, 43, walked into Dunblane Primary School in the small Scottish town and shot sixteen children and one adult dead before committing suicide.

Public outcry at the killings in March 1996 and an official enquiry entitled the Cullen Report forced new gun laws to be brought in.

Subsequently, the Firearms 
(Amendment) Act 
1997 and the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997 were enacted, 
effectively making private ownership of handguns illegal in the United 
Kingdom.

The Dunblane massacre remains one of the deadliest criminal acts involving firearms in the history of the United Kingdom.

Mr
 Berni was renovating his uncle's house in the quiet village of Dinas 
Powys, near Cardiff, when he made the gun haul discovery.

He
 found one set hidden in the space behind a wall heater and another when
 he took down a plasterboard wall to uncover the secret arsenal.

The firearms ranged from a pistol from the 1930s to a pump-action shotgun. Around 250 live bullets were also found.

He added: 'I was shocked because there weren't any bricks in the wall but a lot of shotgun barrels and hand guns.

'They
 obviously belonged to somebody who knew what they were doing as they 
were all greased and beautifully wrapped up in newspaper.'

Police are working on the theory that the owner of the guns died after concealing them in the house.

History: The newspaper found hidden in the wall is dated the day after the Dunblane shootings happened on March 13, 1996

Kept secret: It is believed the previous owner of the house in Dinas Powys died after hiding the weapons

Following the discovery the police were called to the modern semi-detached home and carried out a search with sniffer dogs.

A South Wales Police spokeswoman said: 'Police in Barry are investigating the discovery of up to 30 old firearms at a property under renovation in Dinas Powys.

'The weapons have been removed safely by trained police officers.

'It is believed that they have remained undiscovered for several years having been concealed by a previous owner of the property.'

Law change: Private ownership of handguns was banned in 1997 - a year after the Dunblane massacre

Collection: The weapons were all found to be in pristine condition and had all been carefully wrapped up

The killing of sixteen innocent children and their teacher at a primary school in a Scottish village - known as the Dunblane massacre - remains one of Britain's worst mass-shootings.

Misfit loner Thomas Hamilton, pictured right, burst into Dunblane Primary School gym and opened fire - killing the pupils and their teacher, Gwen Mayor, on March 13, 1996.

The former Scout leader fired at random in the school's gym before turning the gun on himself.

The world looked on in horror as details of the bloody massacre in Scotland unfolded.

Andy Murray, the British tennis player, was a pupil at the Dunblane school at the time of the shootings.

He has described hiding under the table in his classroom during the attack.

It prompted outrage from around the world, including from the Queen, pictured below laying flowers at the scene, and then Prime Minister John Major, who called it a 'sick and  evil act'.

'I find it difficult to express the feelings I know will be felt throughout Dunblane,' said the Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth, who represented Dunblane.

'This is a close-knit community where everyone knows everyone else and the impact of this horrible tragedy will be felt in every household.'

The subsequent public inquiry revealed that Hamilton had licenses for six guns and had previously been investigated by local police for inappropriate behavior around young boys.

Among other transgressions, while serving as a scout leader, Hamilton reportedly took photos of semi-naked boys without their parents' permission.

The year after the massacre Tony Blair introduced the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 which banned private ownership of the remaining handguns in England, Scotland and Wales, and left only some historic and sporting handguns legal.

Dunblane was one of three major mass-shootings in modern British history, after the tragedy of Hungerford and before a second massacre in the Lake District in Cumbria two years ago.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to a massacre in the Lake District as taking place at a “school”.  We are happy to accept this was not the case and are sorry for any confusion caused.
