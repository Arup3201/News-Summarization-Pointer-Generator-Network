Accused: Supermarket boss Alison Potts is alleged to have pocketed £200 raised by her colleagues for a badly injured soldier

A supermarket boss stole £200 her staff had raised for a soldier who lost both legs in Afghanistan, a court was told.

Employees at a Sainsbury store in Altrincham organised a whip-round when they learned the grandson of one of their colleagues had been maimed in action.

But the store’s commercial manager Alison Potts is alleged to have taken the money - and to have repeatedly fobbed off the serviceman’s grandmother when she later asked about the cash.

Mrs Potts, of Bowdon, 
denies four counts of theft and two counts of fraud in a trial at 
Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester.

Deli counter worker Patricia Harrison, 
the grandmother of the injured soldier, told the jury: 'I had to keep 
going to Alison Potts and ask when she was going to give me the 
collection money.

She did say, ‘I’ve got to count it.'

Mrs Harrison told the court she repeatedly tackled the 49-year-old boss in the staff canteen.

She said: 'I didn’t like to ask, ‘Have 
you got the money?’ I did say ‘I believe there’s a collection’ and she 
said ‘I’ve got to count it’. '

'She used to say ‘I’ll see you tomorrow’ or ‘I’ll see you next week’.'

Asked how often she had asked about the collection, Mrs Harrison replied: 'It was quite a few times.'

'People in the store thought I had 
already got the collection money and they were shocked when they found 
out so many weeks afterwards.

Collection: Staff at the Sainsbury's store in Altrincham had a whip round to raise the cash for Patricia Harrison's grandson

'I must have asked her at least 12 times but there was always some excuse.'

Mrs Harrison told the court she took a 
week off work when she learned in December 2010 that her soldier 
grandson Jason had been hurt.

She said she learned about the 
collection when she returned to work at the store, where she had been 
employed for nine years.

Staff had placed a collection bucket in the 
canteen and raised about £200.

Another member of staff, Phil Walker, 
told the jury he had approached Mrs Potts about the collection and she 
had told him to ‘get it out of the till’.

Mr Walker told the court: 'Obviously, it’s stealing.'

He added that he informed a colleague 
before taking the money out of a till and handing the cash in an 
envelope to Mrs Harrison and her husband David, who also worked in the 
store.

Mrs Potts is also accused of stealing 
more than £6,000 from the store by carrying out ‘refunds’ even though, 
it is alleged, no customers were present during the transactions.

Mrs Potts worked for Sainsbury for 25 years although she has now left the company, the court heard.

Elizabeth Nicholls, prosecuting, said 
the the ‘refunds’ Mrs Potts carried out were ‘completely fictitious and 
completely fraudulent’.

Referring to the £200 staff had raised, Ms 
Nicholls said: 'The Crown’s case is that the money, all of which was 
handed to Mrs Potts, never found its way to Mr and Mrs Harrison.'

The jurors were told some staff told senior managers at Sainsbury’s about their concerns.

Mrs Potts was suspended as the store launched an investigation, the court heard.

The case continues.
