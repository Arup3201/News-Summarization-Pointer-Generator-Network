A charity dedicated to protecting ponies has sparked outrage by suggesting they should be eaten to save the species.

Dartmoor Hill Pony Association put forward the suggestion 'with reluctance' as the best way to preserve herds on the ancient moorland.

Founder Charlotte Faulkner believes herders will only continue to keep the animals if there is a 'sustainable market' for them.

Fancy eating a horse? The pony group has suggested that a viable market in pony meat (left) for human consumption is the only way to save the species. Sausages made out of pony meat are also pictured (right)

But South West Equine Protection (SWEP) reacted with fury, saying it would never support the breeding of animals for profit.

The charity's welfare officer Becky Treeby said: 'It would be very upsetting to look at foals which in six months' time could be in someone's burger.'

Dartmoor ponies are essential to the ecology of the 368 square mile national park in Devon by keeping the gorse under control.

Dartmoor ponies are essential to the ecology of the 368 square mile national park in Devon by keeping the gorse under control. 

Their numbers have slumped from over 25,000 in the 1930s to fewer than 800 today.

But with ponies selling for as little as £10 at auction, they have been left to breed unchecked and there are now fears of overpopulation.

SWEP favours birth control – castrating stallions, giving them vasectomies or gelding mares – to keep the number of foals down.

But now the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association has suggested that a viable market in meat for human consumption is the only way to save the species.

In a letter proposing the idea sent to SWEP, she said: 'I am writing to ask whether SWEP would consider giving measured support to this understandably upsetting subject, which as pony lovers we find so hard to accept.

'It has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that Dartmoor pony herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them. We are in real danger of ponies disappearing from Dartmoor altogether.'

She added that a meat trade would encourage pony herders to keep the herd's young for at least three years – the entry level set for animals going for meat.

That, in turn, would also mean animals not selected for slaughter could be broken and trained for riding and driving, best done from the age of three.

'Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sales,' she wrote.

The Princess Royal sparked similar protest in November last year by suggesting people should eat horse meat to improve welfare standards.
