Southampton have completed the signing of England goalkeeper Fraser Forster for a fee of £10m from Scottish champions Celtic.

Saints boss Ronald Koeman revealed after Saturday's 1-0 pre-season friendly loss to Bayer Leverkusen that a deal appeared close for the  Celtic stopper, with the clubs having reportedly agreed a fee and the player having already completed a medical.

And on Saturday evening the club released a statement on their website confirming a four-year deal for the 26-year-old.

Koeman said: 'Fraser is a very talented player and we are delighted to be able to bring him to Southampton. This is another important part of our rebuilding process ahead of the start of the season.

'The fact that he has worked with Dave Watson before means we already know all about his strengths and weaknesses, and I am confident that we will be able to help him improve even further.

'Fraser is the perfect fit to help complement the players we already have, and he will add a lot of quality to the squad.

'He is an exciting English player with a very good reputation within the game and, at 26, he will enjoy the best years of his career at Southampton.' 

Top class: Forster saved two penalties in first leg of Celtic's Champions League qualifier against Legia Warsaw

Celtic will bank £7.5m from the sale, with Newcastle United set to bank 25 per cent of the fee under the terms of the deal struck when they sold the player to Celtic two years ago.

The sale of Forster has been pushed through despite the Champions League reprieve that saw Celtic progress to the play-off round in place of Legia Warsaw in the wake of UEFA’s punishment for the administrative error which resulted in the Polish side fielding the suspended Bartosz Bereszynski.

That means Craig Gordon, who has not played a competitive match in more than two years, will now start for Ronny Deila’s side against Slovenian side Maribor, who will host the first leg later this month. 

The appointment of England goalkeeping coach Dave Watson to Ronald Koeman’s backroom staff has been key to Forster’s move and his arrival will put former Celt Artur Boruc’s place at the club in doubt. 

Forster recently travelled with the England squad to the 2014 FIFA World Cup finals, where he worked with Southampton's new Senior Goalkeeping Coach, Dave Watson.

The Northumberland-born custodian began his career with Newcastle United, and had loan spells at Stockport County, Bristol Rovers and Norwich City before joining Celtic in 2010.

After winning three league titles and two Scottish cups as well as gaining UEFA Champions League experience during his time in Glasgow, Forster now moves to St Mary's ahead of the 2014/15 campaign.

After the Leverkusen game Koeman also revealed the club had had a bid - believed to be in the region of £4.5m - rejected by Leeds for right-back Sam Byram.

Press Association Sport understands other top-flight clubs have also enquired about the highly-rated 20-year-old.

'We lost (Calum) Chambers to Arsenal - it (Byram) was a player we had on the list and it's true that we had a bid for him, yes,' the Dutchman said.

'What I heard was that Leeds didn't accept it.'
