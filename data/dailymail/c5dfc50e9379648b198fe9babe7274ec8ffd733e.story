Danny Cipriani has been named in England's preliminary squad for next week's training camp in south-west London, head coach Stuart Lancaster has announced.

It is Cipriani's first Red Rose involvement since winning the last of his seven caps in 2008 and rewards a strong season at Sale Sharks, who he helped achieve a sixth-place finish in the Aviva Premiership.

Cipriani responded to the news by tweeting: 'Nothing makes me more proud to have the opportunity to represent my country again. The Hard work starts now! Thank you for your messages'.

Boost: Sale fly-half Danny Cipriani has been included in Stuart Lancaster's preliminary England squad

Pressure: Coach Stuart Lancaster named his side on Thursday for the upcoming tour of New Zealand

Lancaster has named a 20-strong squad of
 players from those clubs whose season is over and will make further 
additions after this weekend's play-offs.

England tour New Zealand next month, playing a three-Test series against the All Blacks, while a fringe team will face the Barbarians at Twickenham on June 1.

'The New Zealand tour and the game against the Barbarians give us a chance to look at a wide group of players,' Lancaster said.

Cipriani has repaired his reputation this season with his strong performances key to Sale's progress and matched by a growing maturity off the pitch, addressing concerns over his attitude and celebrity liftestyle.

'Danny is back because of his form at Sale. He's played well. I take my decisions based on what the coaches say and what I see myself,' Lancaster said.

'I spoke to Danny prior to the Six Nations, giving him areas to work on which he has done. I called him on Tuesday to invite him into the squad.

'I've coached Danny more than most because during the majority of my time as England Saxons coach he was on it. His club have done a fantastic job of making him a more rounded and mature person.'

Reputation: Cipriani has played himself back into form for Sale this year

Hiding: The talented No 10 hasn't been selected internationally for many years
