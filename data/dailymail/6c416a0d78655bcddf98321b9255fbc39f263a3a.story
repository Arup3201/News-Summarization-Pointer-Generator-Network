Facebook is already awash with selfies of makeup-free women - and makeup-wearing men – attempting to raise money for breast cancer charities.

Now, a cervical cancer charity has launched a new app in a bid to raise awareness of the importance of attending cervical screenings.

Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust has released the app as part of their Put Yourself In The Picture campaign.

When Jade Goody was diagnosed with cervical cancer the number of women attending cervical screening soared. It has now dropped to 'pre-Jade Goody' levels with 80 per cent of women taking up their invites

The campaign is aiming to raise awareness of the screening which is thought to save 5,000 lives a year.

It has been launched to coincide with the five year anniversary of the death of Jade Goody.

When the reality television star died of cervical cancer in 2009, more than 400,000 extra women in England were screened for the disease.

However, the number of people attending screenings has now fallen back to 'pre-Jade Goody' levels.

Cervical cancer is largely preventable thanks to the screening programme and the HPV vaccine.

The screening aims to pick up pre-cancerous cells which can be treated before they even become cancerous.

However,
 one in five women who are eligible for screening – that is those 
between the ages of 25 and 64 - do not take up the offer.

A new app allows people to upload selfies and to share them with family and friends on social media while pledging to attend cervical screening. Jade Goody is pictured arriving at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital

For women aged 25 to 29, the figure rises to one in three.

On average, younger women wait for 15 months after receiving their 
invitation before they attend, while among older women the average delay
 is 33 months.

The Put Yourself In The Picture app 
aims to get people talking about cervical cancer again and to encourage 
them to attend a screening.

It
 allows people to upload a selfie into a digital picture frame and to 
share it with friends and family on Facebook and Twitter.

Through the app women can also pledge to attend cervical screening and to encourage their friends and family to do the same.

The app’s release comes after research revealed that the main reason young women do not attend screening is that they keep putting it off.

However, 26 per cent of non-attenders say they do not attend because they are worried it would be painful or embarrassing, and 10 per cent say they put it off because they are worried about what the results might say.

The charity hopes the app will be successful as the research also showed 30 per cent of young women said they felt a friend reassuring them about the procedure would encourage them to attend.

Robert Music, Chief Executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said: ‘It’s very worrying that five years after Jade Goody’s death 20 per cent of women still don’t attend a cervical screening which can prevent cervical cancer.   

‘By launching an app which enables people to literally “put themselves in the picture” on cervical screening, we hope to put cervical screening at the forefront of women’s minds so that they don’t ignore their incredibly important screening invitation.  

‘The app has been designed so that people can share their pictures and pledges on social media, so together we can address the decline in uptake of cervical screening in the UK.’

Every day in the UK, eight women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and almost three die of the disease.
