Ed Miliband’s popularity has slumped to its lowest level ever – rivalling even Iain Duncan Smith’s appalling personal ratings during his disastrous spell as Tory leader.

The latest Ipsos MORI survey shows that six in ten British adults say they are dissatisfied with the Labour leader, compared to just 24 per cent who are satisfied.

His net satisfaction rate of minus 36 per cent is comparable with the low point of Mr Duncan Smith's leadership, eight months before he was ousted as by the Tory party in 2003.

Trouble: Ed Miliband has faced growing pressure, including his appearance at the TUC conference yesterday where his speech was met with near-silence

Even among Labour supporters Mr Miliband has negative ratings, with 52 per cent of Labour supporters dissatisfied with his performance compared to 40 per cent who are happy with it.

Worryingly for the party as a whole, Labour’s support also continues its downward trend. It is now just three points ahead of the Conservatives.

The disastrous ratings come just days after Mr Miliband received the silent treatment at the TUC congress and it emerged he had bottled plans to dilute the unions’ block vote at Labour conferences.

And earlier this week, Chancellor George Osborne likened his Labour counterpart Ed Balls to Monty Python’s Black Knight for refusing to accept the recovery is gaining momentum.

The poll shows that only Nick Clegg is more unpopular than Mr Miliband, with a net satisfaction rating of minus 40 per cent, down five points over the past month.

David Cameron has a rating of minus 20, down three points; although most Tory voters remain satisfied with his leadership.

The most popular party leader is Nigel Farage of UKIP, although his net satisfaction rating is still minus seven, and more than a third say they did not know what they thought of him.

The small print is even bleaker reading for Mr Miliband. Almost twice as many people think Mr Cameron is a capable leader as think the same of Mr Miliband (53 and 28 per cent respectively).

While 47 per cent see Mr Cameron as good in a crisis, just 20 per cent say the same about the Labour leader. The Prime Minister is also seen as more likely to have sound judgement than any of his rivals.

Leadership: Just 24 per cent of voters are satisfied with Mr Miliband, the same as Nick Clegg

Pressure: Among those intending to vote, the Labour leader is now down to just three points

Just one in five (19 per cent) think the Labour leader has got a lot of personality, compared to 40 per cent who say the same of Mr Cameron.

However, Mr Cameron did worse on some questions – he is seen as more out of touch than other leaders, and eight in 10 believe he looks after some sections of society more than others. Both Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg are seen as having more style than substance.

Overall, Labour’s support stands at 37 per cent, down three points; with the Tories on 34 per cent, up four. The Lib Dems are on 10 per cent – below UKIP on 11 per cent.

The poll also confirms the public’s economic optimism continues to improve, with 46 per cent believing conditions will improve over the next year.

Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said: ‘There has been much discussion over the perceived softness of Labour’s lead, and this poll shows that clearly – with a fall in Labour supporters’ certainty to vote giving them just a three point lead.

‘David Cameron maintains his lead on key prime ministerial qualities on being capable and good in a crisis – although remains vulnerable on being seen as out of touch. Ed Miliband’s satisfaction ratings, though, have fallen from 40 per cent at the end of last year to 24 per cent this month.’
