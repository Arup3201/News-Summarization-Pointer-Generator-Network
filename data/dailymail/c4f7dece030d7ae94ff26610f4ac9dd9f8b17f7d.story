Twickenham will stage the inaugural European Rugby Champions Cup Final on May 2 next year – three years after it last hosted the continent's showpiece fixture in its previous guise.

The formation of new competitions in the wake of a revolt by English and French clubs has led to plans for Italy to stage the match to be abandoned. Amid a turbulent spell of political unrest last season, it was announced that the 2015 final would take place at the iconic San Siro Stadium in Milan, if the Heineken Cup survived.

Instead, the competition - which had taken place for 19 seasons - was replaced by the new, streamlined Champions Cup, with clubs assuming greater control over that and the secondary Challenge Cup tournament. Since that historic development, a pool draw has taken place, but there has been a logistical delay in revealing fixture details.

Glory: The European Rugby Champions Cup has replaced the Heineken Cup, which Toulon won in 2014

Hosts: Twickenham will be the venue for the inaugural European Rugby Champions Cup final on May 2, 2015

International: The ERCC final will take place four months before England face Fiji in their World Cup opener

Looking on: England head coach Stuart Lancaster will hope to see some of his players in the ERCC final

An announcement is due to be made on Tuesday that London will host the finals on May 1 and 2, with Twickenham securing the Champions Cup decider just four months before the World Cup begins at HQ with England v Fiji. The major final was held there as recently as May, 2012, when Leinster crushed Ulster 42-14 in a one-sided, all-Irish encounter.

The decision to stage the game at one of the world’s leading venues makes sense in terms of capacity - 82,000 - and potential revenue. It is sure to be a lucrative sell-out, but doubtless organisers will be encouraged to consider the merits of taking a final to Italy in the near-future, to drive further development of the sport in that country.

During the 19 seasons of the Heineken Cup, Cardiff staged seven finals, with four taking place in London and three in Dublin. The remaining finals were held in Edinburgh (two), Paris (two) and Bordeaux.

European fixtures will be announced on Thursday.

Joy: Jonny Wilkinson lifted the Heineken Cup for the second year in succession with Toulon in 2014

Showpiece: Saracens were beaten by Toulon in the 2014 Heineken Cup final - the last of the previous format

Return: The ERCC final will see Twickenham host its first continental final in three years, and fifth overall
