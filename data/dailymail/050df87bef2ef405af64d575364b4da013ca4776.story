A police officer who fought to save the life of a young girl who was medically dead for 20 minutes after being crushed under a car has celebrated becoming her godfather - seven years later.

PC Jon Duckham was sent to the scene of the horrific accident in October 2007 where he found little Amy Samuel trapped under the wheels of her family's one tonne car.

The toddler - who was just two at the time - had suffered horrific crush injuries after the handbrake was left off and the car rolled back over her.

PC Duckham worked with emergency services to free the girl from under the Fiat Punto at the car park in Darlaston, West Midlands, after she stopped breathing.

Paramedics battled to save her and she was transferred to hospital where Pc Duckham was tasked with telling parents Caroline Samuel, 31, and Gavin Manns, 34, to expect the worst.

She spent days in intensive care on a life support machine but miraculously fought back and spent a week defying the odds slowly recovering from her injuries.

PC Duckham was assigned as the family liaison officer to Amy's parents as she struggled back to health.

During that time he ferried the worried couple back and forth to Birmingham Children's Hospital and offered them support and advice.

Since then the 42-year-old had spent the last seven years helping the family nurse her back to full health, visiting her on his days off and even joining the family on nights out.

And last Sunday the delighted police officer was asked to be Amy's Godfather for her christening at St Bartholomew's church, in Wednesbury in the West Midlands.

Today the officer said he was honoured to be asked to undertake the role for the little girl, now aged eight, who he watched come back from the dead.

PC Duckham - who has worked for West Midlands Police for 19 years - said: 'Seeing Amy on life support and hearing cherished memories from her mum and dad was the most painful thing I've experienced in nearly 20 years as a police officer.

'I had two young children myself and I couldn't imagine what they were going through.

'The following morning, as doctors prepared to switch off her machine, she showed signs of life and started breathing for herself; she steadily improved and as the family's FLO I stayed in touch every day to watch Amy's incredible recovery.

'As a liaison officer I'm there to help the family through their ordeal, but naturally after six months or so you step away and leave the family to re-build their lives.

'But this was different. You don't expect a little girl who is technically dead to make such a recovery.

'How do you cope with something like that and walk away?

'When the investigation finished I became a family friend and have stayed in touch ever since.

'She is an amazing girl and every time I see her it is just great, she is so full of life.

'The bond myself and Amy have developed over the years in unreal.

'Every time I visit, she runs up to hug me and stays hugging me until I leave. I am truly honoured to be Amy's Godfather.'

'The support and help he offered was beyond belief. He helped us at our worst and I could never thank him enough'

Mother Caroline said she asked PC Duckham if he'd do the honour of being her Godfather four years ago on Amy's advice.

She said: 'Jon has been a part of Amy's life since the accident; the bond they have is unbelievable and nothing can break it.

'I'm delighted to have Jon part of our family he was the obvious choice as Amy's Godfather.

'He was the person there on the scene, there with us through the recovery, none of us drive so he was there to take all of us too and from hospital.

'I know it is his job to help us but it was more than that, he really cared, you don't expect that humanity from a police officer.

'Since then he has always been there for us, coming to see Amy on his days off, she always demands a picture with him when he comes round.'

She added: 'She is his world and it's great he agreed to be her godfather.

'The support and help he offered was beyond belief. He helped us at our worst and I could never thank him enough.

'Amy loves him and there is no-one I would rather have as godfather. Now they will be able to keep their bond going in the years to come.

'When it happened I was just a mess, I was in complete shock, I just told myself to carry on for Amy and then got on with it, convincing myself she would be OK.

'They told us she wouldn't live, but she did, and it wasn't until she got home that it all really hit me.'

At the time Amy's grandad Cliff Yeomans, 58, described PC Duckham as a 'rock' for the family.

He added: 'He has been absolutely fantastic. I couldn't have wished for a better officer or a friend.'
