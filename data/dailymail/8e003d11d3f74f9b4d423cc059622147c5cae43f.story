An Ohio family is in mourning after an 11-year-old boy was accidentally shot dead Wednesday by his 15-year-old cousin.

Ashton Nicholson, of Kent, was pronounced dead at the scene of his relative’s Franklin Township home, authorities said. The teen who shot the weapon remains unidentified because he is a minor.

Authorities told NewsNet 5 that no charges will be filed against the 15-year-old boy, but police are looking into what laws may have been broken by the parents - who were not home - for not having the gun secured.

Investigators told the station the shooter knew where to find the gun in his parents’ bedroomHe was playing with it in the basement when a single shot was fired that killed the popular middle schooler, police said. The death was ruled an accident.

‘I have nothing to indicate that it was an intentional act, nothing to indicate that whatsoever,’ a Portage County police spokesperson told the station.

Authorities also made public the horrifying 911 call made by the shooting suspect’s older brother.

‘My brother just shot my cousin on accident... Oh my God, he shot him with a pistol,’ the mortified caller told the dispatcher.

Police said the shooter handled the situation remarkably well and was very cooperative when they arrived.

‘This is a terrible tragedy that he was involved in, but I have to give him credit for standing up,’ the spokesperson added.

A crisis intervention team was called into Nicholson’s middle school to break the news to the boy’s friends.

‘A lot of our students wrote cards for the family, poems, pictures and stuff like that,’ Principal Anthony Horton told WKYC. ‘He was a well-liked young man.’

Family and friends expressed grief online.

‘My deepest sympathy for you and your family,’ a friend wrote on Facebook. ‘You all are in my thoughts and prayers. So deeply sorry for your loss.’

‘I am so sorry to hear about your loss. I am keeping all involved in my prayers,’ wrote another.

Nicholson’s funeral was held Saturday, according to his obituary.

He left behind his parents, a brother and sister, grandparents and many other family members.
