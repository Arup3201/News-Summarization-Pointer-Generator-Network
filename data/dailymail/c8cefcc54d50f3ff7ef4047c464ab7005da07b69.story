For centuries it was the myth that transfixed fortune-hunters: El Dorado, the dazzling city made of gold, hidden in deepest South America. Countless European bounty seekers lost their lives in search of this legendary place.

Others believed that El Dorado was not a city at all, but a man painted with powdered  gold who had dived into Lake Guatavita, near the modern Colombian capital of Bogota, and whose priceless body lay waiting to be discovered.

Neither the city nor the man was ever found. But as a new exhibition at the British Museum, opening today, shows, European explorers did find an ancient civilisation seemingly obsessed with gold and other precious metals, mined in the Andes.

This was a society with its own sophisticated religious, social and musical rites — but also one capable of extreme violence and addicted to the intoxicating coca leaf, the raw material of modern cocaine.

In the new show, 200 objects from the Museo del Oro in Bogota and 100 from the British Museum reveal just how devoted to gold the pre-Hispanic civilisations, from 1600 BC to AD 1600, were.

They didn’t see gold as a currency but as a magical material of great symbolic and spiritual meaning, closely connected to the immense powers of the sun.

Gold was used to make models of the alligators and jaguars to be found in the South American jungles.

The ancient Colombians revered the animals and thought that if they donned their skins, they could assume their athletic powers.

The jaguar was particularly prized for its strength and ferocity, and its skins were worn by the society’s leaders.

One star exhibit in this show is a flask in the shape of a jaguar made from hammered gold sheets — with a platinum ring strung through its nose. Platinum was as prized as gold in ancient Colombia.

In order to make the transition from the human world to the animal one, these pre-Hispanic civilisations also devised golden costumes.

‘Birds, bats, felines, amphibians, snakes and alligators were just some of the powerful disguises adopted,’ says Elisenda Vila Llonch, the curator of the show.

‘Representations of these animals were frequently made in elaborate gold pieces.

‘Gold objects, including nose, lip and ear ornaments, diadems [ornamental headbands], pectorals [decorations worn on the chest] and pendants enabled a person’s physical transformation, together with paint, animal pelts and feathers.’

They used gold, too, to contain their favourite narcotic stimulants from plants including tobacco, cocaine and the yopo — a tree that produces leaves and beans with hallucinogenic effects.

On show at the British Museum is a huge, egg-shaped shell of gold alloy, 21.4cm long and 10.5cm wide.

This priceless artefact was made purely for the purpose of holding coca leaves. Another exhibit shows a man sitting down in a state of blissful leisure, chewing on a wad of the same leaves.

The pre-Hispanic civilisations became extremely adept at drug-taking. In order for the stimulants to be absorbed better, they were combined with a chalky powder made from lime and smashed seashells.

Delicately carved golden dippers — 
like pipettes — were used to carry the intoxicating powder from 
elaborate drug pouches to the mouth. At other times they used gold snuff
trays — like ornate mini-shovels — piled high with dried or crushed 
yopo seeds, which they then swallowed or sniffed.

By
taking these intoxicating substances, the men of this ancient 
civilisation believed that their spirits might leave their bodies — just
as they did through the wearing of animal skins.

A priest told one of the first Spanish colonials that, under the influence of yopo beans, he had ‘flown’ a vast distance to and from the distant village of Santa Marta in a single night. So the idea of the drug trip is certainly nothing new.

But the world of El Dorado was far from being a zonked-out, peace-and-love civilisation.

Many of the gold objects in the British Museum exhibition are devoted to warfare, including spear-throwers — sheaths in which a spear was placed before it was hurled, to give it greater reach.

One tunjo — or religious figurine — in the exhibition shows a small golden figure at work on the most spine-chilling of activities: headhunting.

In one hand he holds a bow and arrows, in the other the shrunken head of his victim. Two other tunjos show a pair of dead victims tied to sacrificial poles.

Headhunting is thought to have been a common practice in warfare, and these tunjos are supposed by experts to symbolise victory on the battlefield over rival tribes.

The 16th-century Spanish chronicler Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdes described the ritual, saying: ‘If the men of Bogota kill or take any Panches Indians prisoner, they take the heads back to their homeland and put them in their oratories [or prayer chapels].’

Meanwhile, in Spain at around the same time, men were becoming ever more obsessed with the lure of gold.

As Christopher Columbus wrote to the king and queen of Spain in 1503: ‘Gold is the most exquisite of all things. Whoever possesses gold can acquire all that he desires in this world. Truly, for gold he can acquire entrance for his soul into paradise.’

And so, from the early years of the 16th century onwards, Spanish adventurers, their imaginations fired by tales of El Dorado, poured into South America in search of gold.

It was this precious metal, in fact, that provided the main reason for colonising South America.

‘In their eagerness to obtain gold they paid scant attention to the objects into which it was fashioned,’ says Elisenda Vila Llonch.

‘They  had no interest in how or why such items were crafted, or in the archaeological contexts in which they were found: treasure seekers looted burial mounds and often melted down the gold items they found.’

In a 1550 ruling by the royal  Spanish legal court, all pre-Hispanic objects were divided into two categories: gold was to be melted down in furnaces for currency; ritual objects made of bone, shell, wood and feathers — classed as ‘idols of the Devil’ — were to be confiscated and destroyed.

Thus the survival of the objects in the British Museum exhibition is near miraculous, given that ancient tombs, piled high with food, drink, fine textiles and gold masks and chest ornaments for use in the afterlife, were plundered and despoiled.

But what really fuelled the  Spaniards’ gold fever was the legend of El Dorado, the Golden One.

The story is first mentioned by Fernandez de Oviedo in his history of the region, written from 1535 to 1548.

Oviedo tells of a ‘golden king’ who ‘went about covered with  powdered gold, as casually as if it were powdered salt’.

In time, this story became magnified and embellished until European adventurers, including Sir Walter Raleigh — and his son Watt, who was killed battling the Spanish over South American gold — began to believe in a whole golden city or kingdom.

However implausible it may seem to us now, there was a tiny kernel of truth at the heart of the fabulously embroidered tale.

The Muisca people of ancient Colombia were known to have carried out ritual practices on the shores of Lake Guatavita, a round lake that sits in the crater of an extinct volcano.

Tales of one ritual captured Europe’s imagination like no other.  At its height, a Muisca leader was covered in gold dust and taken on a raft to the middle of the lake, where he and his servants threw piles of gold, emeralds and other jewels into the water.

It was believed that these treasures would reach the gods, who would restore order to the world. Among the gold objects were those tunjos — ritual human figurines.

One miraculous Muisca tunjo that survives shows the raft ritual as it happened.

A large figure stands in the middle of the raft, attended on all sides by smaller figures. The main figure is adorned with a gold head-dress, chest plates and nose ornaments.

Full-size versions of these golden religious ornaments are also on show at the British Museum.

Little wonder that, as soon as the Spanish heard of this ritual, they rushed to drain the lake.

In 1580 a notch was cut in the crater that reduced the water level by 20 metres before the crater collapsed, drowning many of the workers.

Some of the discoveries there — golden ornaments, jewellery and armour — were sent to King Philip II of Spain, and a great, ugly scar runs through the side of the crater to this day.

Then, in 1910, a group of British speculators again tried to drain the crater and recovered some gold ornaments and pottery from the bottom of the lake. But they never found the spectacular hoard they sought.

The Colombian government has outlawed draining of the lake now, so the remaining secrets of El Dorado, which have fascinated explorers for centuries, will lie concealed and undisturbed, deep beneath its waters — at least until the glittering myth once again proves too great a temptation for explorers to resist.
