Murdered: Julia Tottle, pictured, died from injuries after being beaten with a vacuum cleaner

A husband who battered his wife to death in a 'fit of rage' when she told him their marriage was over was today jailed for life.

Stephen Hotson, 45, hit his wife Julia Tottle, 51, repeatedly around the head with a vacuum cleaner pipe when she asked him to leave their marital home in Kewstoke, North Somerset.

When Ms Tottle's blood-stained body was discovered by her brother days later Hotson tried to blow up their marital home.

After being thwarted by his brother-in-law, Hotson then tried to kill himself for a second time by jumping from a first-floor window.

A post-mortem examination found that Ms Tottle, who worked at a veterinary surgery in Weston-super-Mare, had suffered nearly 60 injuries.

Hotson denied murder but admitted killing his wife, who was known as Julie, claiming he was depressed and suffering from an 'abnormality of mind'.

However, a jury at Bristol Crown Court took just four hours to reject Hotson's claims and find him guilty of murder by a majority of 11 to one.

The burly defendant stood expressionless as the jury foreman returned the guilty verdict.

The packed public gallery then watched as Judge Neil Ford QC, the Recorder of Bristol, imposed a mandatory life sentence and fixed a minimum term of 14 years' imprisonment.

'You acted in a rage as a result of your wife telling you there was no future in your relationship and that you should leave immediately,' the judge told the defendant.

'Julie Tottle had stood by you even when your behaviour towards her became abusive.

'Finally it is clear she was ground down by your behaviour and couldn't take any more.

'You killed her in a brutal and sustained attack during which she was trying to fend off the blows you were inflicting with a metal tube.'

Judge Ford said Ms Tottle's death had been 'totally devastating' upon her family and particularly her elderly mother Angela, whose final years have been 'irretrievably blighted.'
