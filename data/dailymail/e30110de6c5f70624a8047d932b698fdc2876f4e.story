Britain's boardroom bosses saw their pay packets swell by 50 per cent last year, shocking figures show.

A huge rise in bonuses and other share awards has seen the average pay of a FTSE100 chief executive hit £2.8million.

The figure compares to £1.9million for the year before, and comes as the rest of the country is still seeing wage increases lagging behind inflation.

Britain's boardroom bosses saw their pay packets swell by 50 per cent last year, shocking figures show

Analysis by accountancy firm Grant Thornton showed that the value of bonuses and other lucrative awards have almost doubled in a year for the UK’s best paid bosses.

The increase comes at a time when company shareholders are expressing anger over boardroom largesse.

Some of Britain’s biggest firms, including fashion house Burberry and oil producer BG Group, have seen revolts over pay.

The report showed basic pay for the average FTSE 100 boss has risen from £578,000 to £583,000 – an increase of just one per cent. But the amount of bonuses and lucrative share awards they were handed has risen by some 80 per cent to £1.9million.

Burberry was singled out in the report by Grant Thornton over its handling of a gigantic pay row with investors.

The fashion house awarded its designer-turned-chief executive Christopher Bailey £20million in shares, taking his total package to £28million. Shareholders branded the move ‘obscene’, and a majority rejected Mr Bailey’s pay package.

The report said: ‘Surprisingly, some companies still rely on the annual report and AGM to communicate with shareholders over executive pay.’

BG Group, which emerged from British Gas following privatisation, was last week forced to whittle down its proposed £25million welcome package for its new chief executive to a potential £18million. The windfall for Helge Lund had been described as ‘excessive and insensitive’ by business groups and had angered shareholders.

Advertising giant WPP saw more than a third of its investors refuse to back a £30million pay award for chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell last year.

The review is based on analysis of companies’ annual reports, in which they detail annual pay awards for executives. Following a wave of investor revolts two years ago, companies are now forced to publish a single figure for the amount their top executives could stand to earn.

The report also breaks down the levels of bonuses available by sector.

While mining companies tend to the have the highest average basic pay at £598,000, banks and financial services firms have the highest levels of bonuses.

On average, bank chief executives can earn up to four and a half times their basic pay in bonuses and share awards.

Technology companies tend to have the lowest level of bonuses, which bosses able to earn up to two and a half times their basic pay in extra awards.

RBS, the taxpayer-backed bank, ignited outrage after quietly handing its new chief executive Ross McEwan £1.5million in free shares on New Year’s Eve last year.

Mr McEwan, who is already paid a basic salary of £1million, was being reimbursed for missing out on bonuses after leaving his previous job.

The controversial move came on the same day that Goldman Sachs revealed ‘obscene’ £3million pay deals for a clutch of its top bankers.

Last year the Church of England vowed to ‘turn the tide’ on a culture of lavish bonuses for bankers and business chiefs.

The Church, led by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, promised to use the significant financial firepower of its investments to vote against excessive pay packages and criticised the ‘culture of entitlement and greed’ in big businesses.

Despite attempts to cap bankers’ bonuses, many City banks have found ways to circumvent the new rules by offering staff lucrative share deals and other perks.
