Don Cornelius left behind two lucrative life insurance policies worth hundreds of thousands of dollars - which will go to his ex-wife whom he divorced after a bitter legal battle three years ago.

The creator of Soul Train was found dead in an apparent suicide at his home in the early hours of this morning, according to police.

The 75-year-old was found at his mansion in Sherman Oaks, California with a gunshot wound to the head which was reportedly self-inflicted.

Troubled: Don Cornelius (with his ex-wife Viktoria Chapman-Cornelius) was found at his home in Sherman Oaks, California after apparently committing suicide

It has been revealed that his ex-wife Viktoria Chapman-Cornlieus, whom he 'hated' according to TMZ, will receive around $300,000 in insurance payouts.

Mr Cornelius and his second wife, a Russian model, had their divorce finalised in 2009 amid allegations of domestic abuse on both sides. He told an LA judge he was suffering from 'significant health
issues' at the time.

He was believed to have suffered a stroke and had brain surgery in recent years which left him in a great deal of pain.

This morning, police found Mr Cornelius lifeless at his Mulholland Drive home. He was 
pronounced dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound about an hour later at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, according to the coroner's office.

Police officer Sara Faden said authorities have ruled out foul play. Detectives have not found a suicide note and were talking to the 75-year-old's family about his mental state.

The 911 call was made by one of his two sons from his first marriage to wife Delores, according to TMZ.

His death prompted many to speak of the positive influence he and his show Soul Train had on pop culture, music and the African-American community.

Aretha Franklin, an early performer on the show, told People: 'It's just 
so sad, stunning and downright shocking... a huge and momentous loss to 
the African-American community and the world at large.' 

The soul singer added: 'God bless him for the solid good and wholesome foundation he provided for young adults worldwide and the unity and brotherhood he single-handedly brought about with his most memorable creation of Soul Train.'

Reverend Jesse Jackson told KNX-Los Angeles that Cornelius 'was a transformer'.

He added that he talked to Mr Cornelius a few days ago and there were no signs that he was upset.

Supporter of soul: Aretha Franklin performed on Soul Train early in her career and called the loss of Mr Cornelius as 'downright shocking' today

Quincy Jones said: 'I am shocked and deeply saddened at the sudden passing of my friend, colleague and business partner Don Cornelius.

'Soul Train was the first and only 
television show to showcase and put a spotlight on black artists at a 
time when there were few African-Americans on television at all, and 
that was the great vision of Don.' 

Clarence Avant, former chairman of Motown Records

'His contributions to television, music and our culture as a whole will never be matched. My heart goes out to Don's family and loved ones.'

'Don was a visionary pioneer and a giant in our business.

'Before MTV there was Soul Train, that will be the great legacy of Don Cornelius.'

Clarence Avant, former chairman of Motown Records, said: 'Don Cornelius' legacy to music, especially black music, will be forever cemented in history.

'Soul Train was the first and only television show to showcase and put a spotlight on black artists at a time when there were few African-Americans on television at all, and that was the great vision of Don.'

On his blog, music mogul Russell Simmons called Cornelius 'one of the greatest music legends there was'.

He wrote: 'Don Cornelius gave artists
who had been segregated from most mainstream vehicles of expression a 
chance to perform in front of a huge national audience.

'It was a tremendous opportunity that
changed their careers and the whole music industry. To win a Soul Train
Music Award meant that the most sophisticated tastemakers in the world 
loved your work.'

When Soul Train began in 1970, there was little indication it would become a long-running success - as only a handful of TV stations initially were receptive.

Cornelius said in 2006: 'When we rolled it out, there were only 
eight takers.

'There was just, ''We don't want it. We pass'', with race going unmentioned. No 
one was blatant enough to say that.'

Soul Train arrived at
a time when the U.S. was changing thanks to the civil rights 
movement lead by Martin Luther King, political upheaval and cultural swings.

It was one of the first shows to showcase African-Americans prominently, although the dance group was racially mixed. It showcased legendary artists like Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye and Barry White and brought the best R&B, soul and later hip-hop to TV.

Soul Train, with its trademark opening
of an animated chugging train, also made Cornelius, a former DJ, a star. The dancers soon became as much of an attraction as the music. They made the 'Soul Train' 
dance - where people lined up on two sides and others sashayed
down the middle to show off their moves  - a cultural flashpoint.

Earvin 'Magic' Johnson also cited Cornelius' business acumen.

The former basketball player wrote on Twitter: 'Don Cornelius was the first African-American to create, produce, host and more importantly OWN his own show.

Johnson added: Soul Train taught the world how to dance!'

In his later years, Cornelius had a troubled marriage.

In 2008, Cornelius was arrested at his Mulholland Drive home on suspicion of domestic violence.

He appeared in court on November 14, 2008 charged with spousal abuse and pleaded not guilty before changing his plea to no contest the next year and was placed on 36 months probation.

Cornelius' second wife, Viktoria Chapman-Cornelius, a Russian model, filed for divorce in 2007.

She had filed two restraining orders against her former husband while Cornelius claimed she pepper-sprayed him many times, according to TMZ.

Soul Train was a dance-variety show 
which ran for 35 years, beginning in Chicago as a local 
program and aired nationally from 1971 to 2006.

Don Cornelius was credited with 
helping break down racial barriers and broaden the reach of black 
culture with funky music, groovy dance steps and the cutting-edge style 
of the show.

Over the years, artists including 
Michael Jackson, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Patti LaBelle, Marvin 
Gaye and Barry White appeared on the series.

The series was created by Don Cornelius, who was both its host and executive producer. It holds the title of the longest, continuously running syndicated program on TV.

Cornelius also created the Soul Train Awards, which would become a key honor for musicians. The series also spawned the Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards and the Soul Train Christmas Starfest.

He was known for his catchphrase at the end of every show: '...you can bet your last money, it's all gonna be a stone gas, honey! I'm Don Cornelius, and as always in parting, we wish you love, peace and soul!'

Cornelius stepped down as Soul Train host in 1993. The producer, who has a star on the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame, said in 2006 he remained grateful to the 
musicians who made Soul Train. 

He said: 'I figured as long as the music stayed hot and important and good, that there would always be a reason for Soul Train.'

Donald Cortez Cornelius was born on September 27, 
1936, in Chicago. He had two sons with his first wife Delores.
