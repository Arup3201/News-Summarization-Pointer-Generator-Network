Found: Police officer Elisha Duncan (pictured), 46, likely spent every penny of the $40,000 he had collected from colleagues for this weekend's New York Giants football game, it was today claimed

A New York cop who went missing for two days likely spent every penny of the $40,000 he had collected from colleagues for this weekend's Giants football game, it was today claimed.

Elisha Duncan, 46, a 14-year veteran of the force, vanished on Wednesday after receiving a $600 fee from nearly 70 officers for a  trip to watch the game against the Seattle Seahawks.

He then visited Empire Casino in Yonkers, New York, before being found on Friday sat alone in his parked car in the Bronx. He was in good health, but had no money on him, police said.

Now, sources have claimed that Duncan, a known gambler who had recently told relatives he was battling depression, likely blew the entire $40,000 at the casino

Duncan, who allegedly borrowed $1,000 from his sister after leaving the venue on Wednesday night, was later taken to a psychiatric unit at Jacobi Medical Center, where he remains.

Investigators are trying to retrace his movements over the past two days. However, they do not plan to ask the cop about the missing funds until his mood stablizes.

 'It's a wait and see game,' said one officer.

They have already uncovered angry voicemails and texts from fellow officers who had paid Duncan money for tickets to Sunday's West Coast showdown, wanting to know what was going on.

Duncan was placed on modified duty after he failed to appear for his shifts at the 46th Precinct in the Bronx. His absence followed his collection of the money for the high-profile game.

The cops whom he had collected money from were the ones who reported him missing, according to the New York Daily News. Police initially feared Duncan may have gone off to hurt himself.

However, the officer was discovered in his Bronx neighborhood at around 8:30 p.m on Friday after police viewed security footage of him in the casino.

A source later revealed that Duncan had not touched his latest paycheck, and that his ATM card was not used on Thursday or Friday.

Duncan's father, 92, told the New York Post that he believes his son went into hiding because he did not have the money to give back to the men and was 'depressed'.

Police suggested that the cop - who is divorced and was formerly declared bankruptcy in 2005 - was unlikely to be arrested in the case because of his mental heath issues.

However, individual officers could press charges, they said.
