He won Bolton’s penalty and Fabrice Muamba called him the best player on the pitch, but who is Zach Clough?

He’s a 19-year-old attacking midfielder who recently graduated from Bolton’s academy.

What’s his story?

Clough only graduated to professional football this year, making his debut on January 3 against Wigan in the FA Cup. 

He capped a dream debut with a late goal to eliminate the 2013 champions, and then grabbed two more on his second appearance for the club — a 2-2 draw against Wolves last Saturday. 

His performances have been so impressive that his excited nan, Mavis, called up a local radio station to sing his praises. 

Softly spoken, Clough says it like it is. He attended Audenshaw School, which boasts singer Mick Hucknall as a former pupil, he was a promising cricketer as a boy and wears black boots. There's certainly a lot to like about the teenager from Denton.

'He's not a ragamuffin,' said manager Lennon. 'He's polite and he's well mannered but he's a hungry boy and he just loves playing his football.'

A Manchester City fan, Clough still tries to sneak across to Eastlands with his father Paul to ogle the skills of David Silva and Samir Nasri, who play in his favoured position 'at the top of a diamond or in the hole'.

What type of player is he?

Clough looks slight - standing at just 5ft 7in - but is built like a light-welterweight boxer and can pack a punch. Clough certainly has plenty of tenacity and energy to go with his talent on the ball.

Bolton boss Neil Lennon has likened his ‘street kid’ style to a young Wayne Rooney — lauding his ability to ‘fall over, cut his knee, wipe it off and get on with it.’ 

His Bolton team-mates have also recognised the 19-year-old's durability.

'He won’t freeze,' said gnarled 6ft 5ins defender David Wheater ahead of the Liverpool match on Wednesday. 'He always wants the ball, even in training where I kick him quite a lot.

'Sometimes you can kick the younger lads and they go away but he wants the ball all the time. He’ll be good against Liverpool. He won’t be thinking about what stage he is playing on. He just wants to play football, every game is the same for him. It wouldn't surprise me if he does score or if he gets man of the match – he’s that good.'

He was certainly in contention following another effective display.

Anything else I should know? 

Born on March 8, 1995, the same day that Bolton teammate Emile Heskey made his debut for Leicester City, Clough has already joined an illustrious band; he scored on his Bolton debut, as have Heskey, Daniel Sturridge, Andy Walker and a certain Nat Lofthouse.

The omens are good and Clough is happy to aim high. 'Three goals in two games has been a great start but hopefully it will be 10 goals in 10 games,' he said before the Liverpool game.

'I’ve been popping in goals for a long time. I’ve been here since I was eight years old, and worked under some great coaches. 

And in yet another indication of his modesty, he added: 'Being involved against Liverpool in a game live on Match of the Day would be a dream come true. What a game it’s going to be – I’ve worked hard to get that sort of moment. The whole nation will be watching.'
