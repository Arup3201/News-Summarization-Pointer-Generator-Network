The Chilean miners freed from a collapsed copper mine three years ago claim they've been tricked out of royalties as filming begins on a Hollywood movie about the dramatic rescue.

Some of the 33 miners are locked in a bitter legal dispute over a contract they signed in 2010 which they claim severely restricts the parts of their rescue story they can make money from. 

Despite the legal battle, shooting on the new film starring Antonio Banderas and Martin Sheen is set to begin this month in Colombia.

Incredible: In 2010, 33 miners were rescued from a copper mine in San Jose, Chile, after being trapped underground for 69 days

'We have to fix our affairs with the 
lawyers and with the [movie] producer that is in the United States,' Luis Urzúa, the group's foreman when the mine collapsed, said. 

'With
the march of time, we have had various complications with respect to 
our life story.

'I don't think we are going to make a movie and then later realize we feel bad [because] our rights were infringed.'

The Guardian reported the legal fray centers on who
retains the long-term rights to key elements of the rescue.

This includes a
private diary kept by the miners and their initial 17 days of entrapment with practically no food.

The men were trapped underground in the San Jose mine for 69 days before they were rescued in October 2010. The rescue was broadcast live on television with more than a billion people tuning in.

It has been reported the men created an underground community that included daily votes on key 
issues, 12-hour work shifts, a system of underground lighting and morning 
prayer meetings.

After rejoining a world intensely curious about their incredible ordeal, the men signed contracts with Chilean law firm, Carey, and a group of Chilean investors.

But the miners now claim the agreements strip them of 
other long-term rights and the corresponding revenue from the sale or 
commercialization of key portions of their entrapment, according to The Guardian.

Ex-shift leader Urzúa says some of the miners are willing to cede rights to make the movie, 
from which they will each receive a portion of the revenue.

He claims the group was pressured to sign the contracts which were only available in English.

Another group of miners, however, claims the contracts were also drawn up in Spanish and were the result of a group vote.

Meanwhile, the movie's underground sequences will be shot inside a disused 
mine in Colombia, while other scenes will be filmed in Chile.
