A Melbourne woman with a rare skin condition which makes her appear bright red has labelled Halloween costumes with facial disfigurements 'offensive'.

Blogger Carly Findlay has urged Trick or Treaters not to wear 'scary face' costumes, such as Freddy Krueger and devil masks.

'I'd like to see scary face ruled out as a Halloween costume,' she wrote in an article, 'My Face Is Not A Halloween Costume', published on the website Blogher this month.

Carly Findlay has ichthyosis, a rare skin condition which causes her skin to appear flushed and scaly

Ms Findlay is saddened that some children are frightened of her appearance

Ms Findlay has Ichthyosis, an incurable condition which affects some 10 to 20 people per million. 

It causes her skin to shed rapidly and she often appears flushed and scaly. 

Sometimes, children find her appearance frightening, hiding behind their parents' legs, which she said made her sad.

'I don't want to scare people,' she wrote, before pinning the blame on scary masks and frightening film and TV characters. 

'I think that it's because they've not seen people with visible differences before,' she continued. 

'But I also believe it's because they have seen masks and screen characters who are depicted as evil.' 

Talking to Daily Mail Australia, she singled out monster costumes as perpetuating negative stereotypes.

'They portray people who have facial differences in a really negative way,' she said on Thursday. 

'You know, they’re villains, they’re scary, something to be feared.'

Ms Findlay said characters in films who look different were 'never' cast as the hero, but 'always the villain'. 

Many others with the condition have encountered similar stigma, she said.

'A lot of people I know with my skin condition, they're asked whether they've put on make-up on Halloween. 

'They can get quite offended.' 

'In my Facebook feed, I’ve seen three or four parents say their (children have) been asked about their "Halloween costume".' 

The spooky festival has become increasingly popular in Australia in recent years.

'Dress up at Halloween,' Ms Findlay told Daily Mail Australia. 'But maybe consider doing it respectfully and creatively'

Ms Findlay said keen trick or treaters should choose more creative and appropriate Halloween gear. 

For instance, by dressing up as athletes, scientists or positive role models. 

'I mean, have fun,' Ms Findlay said. 'Dress up at Halloween.'

'But maybe consider doing it respectfully and creatively without offending someone's culture or appearance.' 

A popular blogger, Ms Findlay has become a vocal advocate for raising awareness with people with conditions that affect their appearance

Ms Findlay has been a vocal appearance diversity advocate in recent years.

Last year, she was ridiculed in a cruel post in the 'WTF' forum on Reddit. 

But she fought back, penning a fiery riposte and finding hundreds of supporters.

'I knew the day would come that someone would create a Reddit thread about me, using my photo, having a laugh at my appearance,' she wrote. 

'For years, that fear was why I didn't share photos of me online. But now, after gaining confidence and support through years of blogging, I couldn't care whether they call me a lobster or silly putty.

'The love I have around me and success I have had through telling my own story to break down stigma like these Reddit threads is stronger than any of those words.

'Yes I have Ichthyosis. Yes that picture is me. 

'Don't fear it and don't criticise it. I am proud of the way I look, what I have achieved and for telling my story.'

Her principal tormentor ultimately apologised and Ms Findlay was widely praised by punters online and in the media.  

'The level of kindness shown in these situations is always greater than the level of hate,' Ms Findlay wrote.
