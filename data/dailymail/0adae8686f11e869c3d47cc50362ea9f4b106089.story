Former Fulham captain Danny Murphy says all Felix Magath has to offer English football is a masterclass in how not to run a club.

Magath was replaced as Cottagers boss by Kit Symons last week following a disastrous seven-month spell in charge, during which they were relegated from the Premier League and then left rooted to the foot of the Championship with one point from seven games.

The 61-year-old has defended his reign and told German news agency DPA: 'I am convinced that English football has something to learn from German qualities.'

But Murphy hit back, telling Press Association Sport: 'All he has to offer is to show other people how not to do it.'

Magath's methods have come under fierce criticism from former players, notably ex-captain Brede Hangeland who was once told by the veteran boss to treat a leg injury by rubbing cheese onto the sore area.

And Murphy, a team-mate of the Norwegian defender for almost five years, revealed an even more bizarre twist to the unorthodox treatment.

'I texted Brede to ask if it was true,' he added.

Felix Magath lasted just 18 games in charge of Fulham before being sacked by the Championship strugglers

Murphy has turned from player to pundit since retiring from football but could he be set for a managerial role?

'Brede told me it was, and that the cheese had to be soaked in alcohol, and that he was told to phone his mother because it would help to speak to someone who loves him while the cheese is working!'

Magath said of the Hangeland reports: 'I merely suggested it could be worth trying the old wives' tale of applying quark to the injured area. I would never tell a doctor what to do.'

Murphy added: 'It's sad that a club as stable as Fulham is now in such a world of trouble.

'It was a mistake to keep (Magath) in charge after they were relegated. The players I spoke to were desperate to get out because of him.'

Murphy has expressed an interest in taking the Fulham job, although he has not applied for it and as yet has had no contact with the Craven Cottage hierarchy.

In the meantime Symons took charge for Saturday's clash with Blackburn, which they lost 1-0, and will also be in the dug-out for Tuesday night's Capital One Cup third-round clash with Doncaster.

'Kit's a very good coach,' added Murphy. 'He took over on Saturday and although they lost there were a few more smiles on people's faces.

'It's important they get a win against Doncaster to create some confidence.'
