A 14-year-old babysitter has been arrested outside Dallas after she drowned a three-month-old girl while the baby's mother was away at work, police say.

The teen, who was not named, is a relative of the dead infant, though police did not say how they are related.

The drowning shocked residents of the apartment complex in southern Dallas County, Texas, where neighbors say the teen girl and her twin sister were often seen walking to school.

Police were called to the apartment about 6.15am on Monday and found the infant already dead.

It is believed that this is the 14-year-old girl accused of drowning a three-month-old baby while the infant's mother was at work

Detectives said they believe the drowning was intentional. 

'It breaks my heart anytime you respond to a call and someone so innocent…no one more innocent then an infant child… and to try to ascertain what was could have been going through anyone’s mind that would cause the death of innocent child. My heart goes out to the family,' Dallas police Sergeant Warren Mitchell told KTVT-TV.

The station reports that the mother rushed home after learning about the death. She could be heard screaming outside her apartment as detectives conducted their investigation. 

The drowning happened about 6.15am. When authorities arrived, the infant was already dead

As distraught family members gathered outside the home, at least one woman collapsed and had to be taken to the hospital for examination. 

At least one other teen was in the apartment at the time of the drowning. That teen is being questioned as a witness.

So far, the teen babysitter has not been formally charged. 

She is being held at a juvenile detention center. 

Detectives did not comment on a motive behind the killing.
