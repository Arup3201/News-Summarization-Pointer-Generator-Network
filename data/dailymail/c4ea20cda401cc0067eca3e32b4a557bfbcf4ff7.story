Football legend and Hollywood hardman Vinnie Jones' latest role sees him launch his own Spanish lessons for British holidaymakers - including phrases such as 'Oi, come over here and get in this selfie mate'.

The video tutorial shows the former Wimbledon and Chelsea player teaching a host of his favourite Spanish sentences such as 'excuse me pal, can I have another beer please?' and 'Alright sunshine, how you keeping?'

The language lesson, launched by mobile network Three, hopes to give the 13 million Brits who will travel to Spain this summer some useful phrases for their holiday.

The short film sees Vinnie, 50, wearing a bright floral short in front of a Spanish flag, teaching more than 10 'helpful' questions and sayings so holidaymakers can make it from 'la playa' to 'el bar'.

From April 1, Three's Feel At Home service will allow customers to call, text and use the internet in Spain at no extra cost.

Vinnie, famous for starring in 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock...', said: 'I've holidayed in Spain for years and you can't beat it for sun, sea, sand and a few sangrias.

English: Hi, my name's Vinnie, what's yours?

Spanish: Hola, me llamo Vinnie, ¿y tú?

English: Alright sunshine, how you keeping?

Spanish: Hola cielo ¿cómo te va?

English: Morning my friend, you seen the temperature today?

Spanish: Buenos días amigo, ¿has visto la temperatura hoy?

English: Which way to the beach? I need to sort my tan out.

Spanish: ¿Por dónde se va a la playa? Tengo que ponerme más moreno.

English: Oi, come over here and get in this selfie mate.

Spanish: ¡Eh, tío! Ven aquí para que salgas en este selfie.

English: Excuse me pal, can I have another beer please?

Spanish: Oye, ¿me das otra cerveza por favor?

English: Is it okay if I got your number?

Spanish: ¿Podrías darme tu número?

English: Wow, slow it down, I don't speak much Spanish

Spanish: Uy, más despacio, que no hablo mucho español.

'Along the way I've managed to pick up a bit of the local lingo so it's great to be able to share some with my fellow Brits and help them out as they prepare for their holiday.

'Hopefully with this and the new offering from Three, they're going to have a blinding trip this year.'

The phrases cover everything for the modern tourist including those looking for love: 'Podrías darme tu número?'as well as sun worshippers: '¿Por dónde se va a la playa? Tengo que ponerme más moreno.'

Vinnie, who now lives in LA,, even covers the Spanish needed for those wanting to capture every moment of their holiday with a selfie: '¡Eh, tío! Ven aquí para que salgas en este selfie.'

Tom Malleschitz, marketing director at Three, said: 'Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations for Brits and it's a forthcoming addition to our list of countries where you can use your phone abroad at no extra cost.

'We thought it would be great to give those heading to Spain a helping hand learning the lingo by recruiting one of our most famous Brits, Vinnie Jones, to give us all a fun Spanish lesson.

'Now customers can order a drink or take a selfie in Spanish before they take the picture and post it on Facebook.'

The Feel at Home service will automatically activate as soon as Three customers land in one of the 18 places where the service is available.

Customers' who go out of bundle will still benefit from reduced roaming rates.

Spain and New Zealand will join France, Switzerland, Israel, Finland, Norway, USA, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Macau, Australia, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden, Denmark and Republic of Ireland, where the Feel at Home service is currently available.
