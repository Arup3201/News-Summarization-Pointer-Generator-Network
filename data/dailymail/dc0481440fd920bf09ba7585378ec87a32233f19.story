Obama bolstered his reelection coffers to the tune of $15million last night following a star studded Hollywood dinner where George Clooney played the suave host and Chef Wolfgang Puck whipped up dinner.

Obama reminded 150 of his Hollywood set donors that his famed Hope poster from the 2008 was derived from a photograph of Obama sitting next to Clooney when Obama was a U.S. senator. Clooney had been in Washington advocating on behalf of Darfur.

'This is the first time that George Clooney has been photo-shopped out of a picture,' Obama said.

'Never happened before, never happen again.'

In this crowd, Obama didn't even need to mention gay marriage to get a vigorous applause.

'Obviously,' the president said obliquely, 'yesterday we made some news.'

The event, held under a stretched 
transparent tent outside Clooney's sprawling tudor-styled canyon home that he bought about 20 years ago from Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks, 
raised nearly $15million, a record for a single fundraiser.

The guests paid $40,000 to attend, 
accounting for about $6 million of the evening's financial haul for 
Obama's campaign and the Democratic Party.

The remainder came from a raffle for 
small dollar donors. Two winners - both women - got to take part in the 
dinner.

One winner was Beth Topinka, 55, a science teacher from New Jersey. Her son was in the Navy, and her husband- though a Republican- voted for Mr Obama in 2008.

The second winner was Karen Blutcher, 45, who works for a utility company in St Augustine, Florida. She brought her husband, who served in the military, as her guest.

In the advertisement for the competition, the upbeat president wrote: 'You'll automatically be in the 
running to join me and George Clooney at his place on May 10th.

'It's not often I get away from work, so I look forward 
to spending a fun evening in LA with a couple supporters like you.'

'We raised a lot of money because people love George,' Obama said. 'They like me; they love George.'

Aside from a small number of brief interjections of serious talk, Mr Obama kept the majority of his speech light.

'And Michelle and I -- people have 
commented on the fact that I've got gray hair now. There was a blog post
 about look how wrinkly Obama is getting. It was sort of distressing. 
George doesn’t have to go through these things,' he said.

'Sometimes the 2008 campaign gets 
romanticized and everybody says how perfect it was and I have to remind 
them, no, I was there.'

The big bottom line of the event will
 help the President's re-election campaign funding, as he faces the huge
 sums of money raised by Republican groups like American Crossroads, set up by Karl Rove.

Obama's campaign chief David Axelrod 
told Politico that it would take 181,000 of their small-time donors to 
match a recent anonymous $10m donation to Crossroads.

'So George is pitching in here, and lending his name to this
 event, and himself to this event. It's really helpful to us.'

Crossroads, however, have seized on the planned dinner as another opportunity to attack Obama for being a 'celebrity president'.

The star power certainly helps the Democrat's bottom line, however, as Clooney told the Wall Street Journal last
 month that they had already raised around $10m, 'which is about 
double anything that's ever been done before. All I know is that it's 
the biggest fundraiser to date - ever.'

At the dinner, Mr Obama gave serious 
compliments to the host, adding: 'He seems to occupy a constant state of
 grace, and uses his extraordinary talents on behalf of something truly 
important.'

The Oscar-winning film star has hit the headlines recently for his involvement in the humanitarian campaign over Sudan.

He was even arrested while attempting to draw attention to the bombing of refugees in the Nuba valley.

For Obama, the A-list party was not 
only a financial hit, it gave the president the kind of Hollywood buzz a
 Republican seldom gets. But the glitzy event, with its glamour and 
wealth, also has its risks and it set up a stark contrast with Obama's 
mission on Friday to highlight the plight of struggling homeowners in 
Nevada.

Among those at the dinner were such 
actors and performers as Robert Downey Jr., Barbra Streisand and her 
husband James Brolin, Jack Black, Salma Hayek and Tobey Maguire, who 
shared a table with Clooney and Clooney's girlfriend Stacey Kiebler.

Preparations: The catering trucks lined the street outside George Clooney's Hollywood home on Thursday

All the little details: A server is seen carrying in peanuts, but given that guests are paying $45,000 for a seat at the dinner, they'd better hope the kitchen was focusing on the main meals

Serious security: Police surrounded Clooney's home for the days leading up to the event Thursday night

Soda and beer: Little is known about what is being served at the dinner, but beverages were seen being delivered to Mr Clooney's home on Thursday

There was speculation that other guests may include Obama supporters Halle Berry, Scarlett Johansson, Reese Witherspoon and Harvey Weinstein.

Details have been kept strictly under wraps, but website TMZ revealed that diners will be catered for by famous chef Wolfgang Puck, adding that the food would be 'better than the Oscars.'

Heading to Clooney's house, along the
 exclusive canyon roads, families gathered at dinner time to gawk, wave 
and cheer the presidential motorcade. Children manned a lemonade stand 
with a sign: 'Presidents drink free.'

Around the corner, a boy held up another hand-drawn piece of cardboard: 'Will trade Lakers for Bulls if you stop.'

And yet one more: 'Our gay family says thanks Mr. President.'
