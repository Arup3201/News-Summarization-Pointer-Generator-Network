A former Senior Australian of the Year accused of fraudulently claiming $9 million of taxpayers' money for one of the country's top indigenous schools will face trial in September.

Jean Illingworth, the former principal of Djarragun College near Cairns, is accused of inflating student numbers to obtain a huge boost in extra government funding for the school.

But supporters of the disgraced teacher, 66, are standing by her and have already helped raise $31,829 towards her legal fees for the trial. She will face one charge each of fraud and obtaining financial advantage by deception.

Fired: Jean Illingworth, a former Queensland principal, is facing fraud charges after she allegedly bumped up enrolment numbers to secure extra funding. Here she is seen arriving at the Magistrates Court in Cairns, July 10, 2013

Her backers have so far donated 40 per cent of the target amount reportedly needed to defend her against the fraud claims.

During court proceedings last year, it was revealed Ms Illingworth was still paid $288,000 a year by the school, despite being stood down in March 2011.

A trial date was set for September 22 during a pretrial hearing in the Cairns District Court on Thursday.

Up to 70 witnesses, including 50 current and former school staff, will be called during the trial, which is expected to take up to five weeks.

The court also heard Crown prosecutors had 17,000 documents, mainly enrolment and financial records, in their possession.

About 200 of these will be presented at the trial.

Prosecutors alleged Ms Illingworth enrolled children who never attended classes to gain extra funding.

The former star of the local community worked at the college for about a decade.

She was named the Queensland Senior Australian of the Year in 2009 for her work in transforming the once-dysfunctional college into a much admired model of success.

Aboriginal Australian lawyer Noel Pearson, who now runs the school, once described her as a 'true social entrepreneur'.

The fundraising website 'Defend Jean' claims: 'Jean Illingworth worked tirelessly at Djarragun College for ten years, turning a small dysfunctional school into a flagship example of successful indigenous education.'

It claims: 'The very least Jean deserves is a fair trial. The legal costs involved in achieving this are almost prohibitive.'

Ms Illingworth's lawyers still have the option to apply for a judge-only trial or request jurors be polled to see if they are biased due to publicity surrounding the case.

Before the trial takes place the case will go before the court again next month.

The 66-year-old has been in custody in a Townsville women's prison for almost a year.

She was released on bail after being charged early last year but was then taken into custody in July after allegedly contacting witnesses in the trial.

A separate trial relating to these alleged offences - she has been charged with two counts of perverting the course of justice - may take place in November.
