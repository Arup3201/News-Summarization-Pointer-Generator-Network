Louis Thompson's late goal fired Swindon to the top of Sky Bet League One as they came from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Fleetwood.

A point was enough to take Town above Bristol City, who were playing in the FA Cup, and they were gifted the chance to go ahead after 13 minutes when Stephen Jordan fouled John Swift in the area.

But striker Michael Smith saw his spot-kick saved by Fleetwood keeper Chris Maxwell, and the hosts took control with two goals early in the second half from Josh Morris.

A wonder-strike from Jim O'Brien helped Coventry to a 2-0 win at Midlands rivals Walsall.

Richard O'Donnell had already saved a penalty from City's Marcus Tudgay but he was beaten by O'Brien's 30-yard strike in the sixth minute.
