Emotional: The 3-year-old was reunited with Traci Gilbert yesterday - having met the stranger after he was taken during a carjacking

This is the tearful moment a three-year-old abducted by a carjacker was reunited with the woman who saved him.

The child ran into the arms of Traci Gilbert again yesterday after meeting her for the first time at 2.15am having escaped the clutches of the thief in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The carjacker had jumped into the boy's father's car 
while he stood just feet away and took off with the vehicle, but the 
three-year-old was still inside.

Luckily, the thief left the boy at a 
home nearby to the 7-Eleven and a woman 
opened the door to his cries.

'Help me, I'm cold,' the boy told Ms Gilbert after her doorbell rang in the early hours of Sunday.

Paying tribute to her, dad Anthony Pettiford said they will be spending lots of time together from now on.

'She's family now, so I told her you know, she's welcome anytime we're going to set up dinners. We're family, we're connected,' he told 9-news.

The youngster was covered in snow, wearing a thin jacket and carrying a bag containing soy milk, a cup, two diapers, wipes and pajama bottoms when he was found.

'He wasn't crying. He never shed a single tear the whole time. That boy is a hero to me,' Gilbert told  Associated Press.

'[The driver] didn't even wait until the child was safe inside,' Gilbert said angrily, recounting there had been snow, sleet and low temperatures.

Relief: Anthony Pettiford, pictured, said he was thankful the carjacker dropped his three-year-old son off at the home of a kind person when his vehicle was stolen

The boy's father, Anthony Pettiford, had stopped at the store and was chatting to a friend just feet from his car when a thief jumped inside.

Pettiford and his friends chased the vehicle for 10 blocks before losing it.

The friends said the thief must have turned back to drop the boy off three blocks from the store, then left the child alone.

'The suspect may not have realised a child was in the car when he stole it,' an officer speculated to 11 News.

'Then after seeing him in the mirror, realised he got more than he bargained for and dropped the child off.'

Pettiford said he believes his son, who has not been identified, was trying to get back to his father when he arrived on the woman's doorstep.

'He knew what to do. He's a champ,' Pettiford said.

Gilbert, a 53-year-old nurse, said 
she was afraid the boy's father had left him in the cold after a 
domestic argument or he had run away from home.

But when she asked, the boy told her his parents were 'happy'.

Search: Police in Colorado Springs, Colorado have not tracked down the suspect or the stolen 1995 Chrysler New Yorker (file picture)

Gilbert's adult son took the boy in his car to find his father and waved down an officer who was searching for him.

'I'm thankful that my son went to a good person,' Pettiford told 11 News.

Barbara Miller, spokeswoman for the Colorado Springs Police Department, said it is unlikely Pettiford will face charges as he was by the car.

The suspect and the white 1995 Chrysler New Yorker are both still missing.

Police will use a forensics investigator who specialises in working with children to interview the toddler to glean information about the thief.
