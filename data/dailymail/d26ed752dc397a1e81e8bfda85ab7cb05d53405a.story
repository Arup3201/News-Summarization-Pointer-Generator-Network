Britain's Got Talent judge and loyal Evertonian Amanda Holden has stamped her seal of approval on Everton's 2014/15 kit.

The TV presenter, and celebrity supporter, has stepped out in the famous blue shirt for Everton fansite www.evertonarentwe.com.

Last year, Holden joined a large number of Toffees fans who voted for this season's crest to adorn the club's shirt.

Amanda Holden has been a judge on popular ITV show Britain's Got Talent for the past eight series

She tweeted in 2013: 'Question for Everton fans. This is my vote for the new Everton FC crest what's yours?'

Over 20,000 fans were involved in the process and more than 400 supporters took the time to send in their own designs via evertonfc.com as the club searched for a new crest.

Fans had the opportunity to tell the club how they wanted the badge to look, as well as give their view on the importance of individual elements including Prince Rupert's Tower, the laurels and the year the club was formed, 1878.

The winning crest now features a collection of traditional Everton elements as well as the Latin saying 'Nil satis nisi optimum' which means 'Nothing but the best is good enough'.

Romelu Lukaku and his Everton team-mates wore the famous strip against West Brom on Saturday
