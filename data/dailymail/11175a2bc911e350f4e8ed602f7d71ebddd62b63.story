Millions of pounds from Britain’s controversial overseas aid budget is being diverted to fund housing and benefits for asylum seekers living in the UK.

The Home Office, one of the departments hit hardest by the Chancellor’s spending cuts, is quietly siphoning off around £10million a year.

The cash, which is enough to put 200 police officers on the streets, would  otherwise have to be found from the department’s own budget.

Officials insist the raid on the swollen £11billion international aid budget falls within international rules for development spending. Crucially, it counts towards the contentious Government target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid.

The news that not all the money is being sent overseas was welcomed by backbench Tories, who have criticised generous spending by the Department for International Development (DfID).

Andrew Percy, Tory MP for Brigg and Goole, said: ‘If we do have to provide this support within our international obligations it is right it should come from the foreign aid budget.

‘It should not come from the Home Office budget which should be spent on policing, immigration and border controls.’

The Mail has long highlighted some of the controversial ways aid is spent. Recipients have, for example, included India and Nigeria, which have their own space programmes.

The aid money being taken by the Home Office pays for accommodation for asylum seekers and their families during their first 12 months in the UK. It also funds cash support, or benefits.

It can only be claimed by the department if an asylum case is successful. Support for failed asylum seekers does not count towards the 0.7 per cent target, so the Home Office funds it.

Spending on a string of other Home Office projects is also being taken from the aid pot.

They include the Gateway Protection Programme, which involves officials identifying potential refugees overseas, arranging their travel to the UK and helping them to settle.

The Mail can also reveal that the Government is dipping into the aid budget to try to stop the smuggling of prostitutes, sham brides and drugs to the UK.

The DfID is funding anti- trafficking programmes in Vietnam, China, Albania, Nigeria, Romania and Poland.

There is long-standing anger among Tories over the aid pledge, which comes at a time of spending restraint at home.

David Cameron has been repeatedly refused to scrap the 0.7 per cent commitment. But last year he hinted at the possibility of the aid budget being used for other purposes, such as peace-keeping defence missions.

Last week, it emerged that Britain had hit the Prime Minister’s 0.7 per cent target, spending more than £11.2billion in a year.

But it was also revealed that £500million of taxpayers’ money was helping to prop up the most corrupt regimes in the world.

A study by the respected organisation Transparency International found that the UK sent funding to all ten of the worst offending nations in 2012 including Somalia, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Syria.

The Home Office said its spending was in line with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines on development spending and consistent with practice in other countries.
