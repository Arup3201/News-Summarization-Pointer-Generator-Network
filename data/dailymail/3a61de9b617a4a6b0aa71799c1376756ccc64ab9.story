The price of fuel at the pumps has fallen to a three-year low, according to AA figures.

As of yesterday, the UK average petrol price was 129.18p a litre - the lowest since February 23 2011 - while the average diesel price was 133.55p a litre, the lowest since February 6 2011.

AA public affairs head Paul Watters said: 'Asda triggered something of a supermarket price war on Tuesday, which was enough to send average UK pump prices to their lowest for more than three years.

The average motorist today is approximately £4.40 a tank better off compared to this time last year

'A year ago, petrol (137.33p) and diesel (141.62p) were more than 8p a litre more expensive. For a typical 55-litre fuel tank, drivers are £4.40 better off.'

But he added that the UK was still lagging behind most of Europe when it came to falls in prices.

Mr Watters said: 'Drivers on the Continent have been enjoying these lower prices sooner. Despite the UK fuel industry's claim to sell the cheapest petrol in Europe before tax, new EU figures show that fierce competition from fuel-price regulation drove Austrian pre-tax prices even lower. 

Asda has introduced a fuel cap in advance of the bank holiday weekend which will benefit motorists planning a late summer getaway. 

A spokesperson said: 'We’re giving our customers and holiday makers the opportunity to fill up their cars with some of the cheapest fuel prices in the market for years, putting much needed cash back in their pockets as the summer holidays begin.

UK fuel prices have fallen to levels not seen since 2011 as a result of a Supermarket price war 

'A full tank of fuel now costs £5 less than last summer and our national price cap benefits everyone across the country, meaning that no-one filling up at Asda will be forced to pay a premium for their fuel because of where they live.' 

RAC fuel spokesman Pete Williams said: 'We’ve been calling for petrol and diesel prices to fall for some time following the decrease in wholesale prices and so this is a welcome move by the supermarkets.

'We would expect to see other retailers to follow in the coming days giving consumers a great opportunity to fuel up ahead of the bank holiday.'
