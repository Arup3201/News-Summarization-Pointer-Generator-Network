Annette Edwards, who is 62, is the world's oldest Page Three girl, while her pet rabbit Darius holds the longest-rabbit record

At 62 and with a 46DD chest, grandmother Annette Edwards holds the world record for being the oldest Page Three model.

And record-breaking is obviously in the air at her Worcester home, because Mrs Edwards' pet rabbit also boasts a world title of his own.

Four-year-old Darius, a Continental Giant breed, is hailed as the longest rabbit in the world.  At four-feet long, he took the title from his mother, Alice, who measured 3ft 8in.

Tomorrow Darius' owner, a mother of 10 and grandmother of 14, will be interviewed on television with her pet to discuss their various triumphs.

Mrs Edwards and her pet, who share the same birthday, will be chauffeured from their home in Stoulton, near Worcester, to appear on the Alan Titchmarsh Show.

Mrs Edwards, who started glamour modelling at 16, says Darius - one of seven pet rabbits she owns - will behave perfectly for the cameras.

'He will love the attention,' she said.  'I’ve kept rabbits since I was a child. They’re amazing, and each has its own personality.'

Mrs Edwards, who still enjoys a modelling career and says she has no plans to stop, says looking after her menagerie of pets helped her stay in shape.

'I eat healthily, exercise, and try to be stress-free,' she said.  'It's about your attitude to life.'

Two years ago she spoke about encouraging her daughter, Paige, then 16, to launch a career in glamour modelling.

'There's nothing wrong with glamour modelling as long as it's tasteful, like Page Three and Playboy,' she said.  'It makes you feel sexy and powerful.'

She added: 'Age is just a number - I don't feel any differently to how I did when I was 31.  It's all in the mind.'

Mrs Edwards and Darius will appear on the Alan Titchmarsh Show on ITV1 tomorrow at 3pm.
