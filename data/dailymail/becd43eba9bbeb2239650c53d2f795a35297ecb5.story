Ajax manager Frank de Boer wants to emulate the way Arsenal play as the Dutch club bid to reach the Europa League quarter-finals.

De Boer was impressed by Arsenal's performance in the 2-0 Champions League win against Monaco on Tuesday night - though the Gunners were knocked out on away goals - and wants Ajax to follow suit.

De Boer said: 'The way they played against Monaco is the way we would like to play as well. High pressure, get the ball back very quickly. I really love the way Arsenal play. When I look at their goals, it sometimes looks like futsal. Passing, moving and always at a high tempo.'

Ajax are hoping to avoid an end to their European run as they take on Dnipro at the Amsterdam Arena on Thursday, with the Ukrainian club currently holding a 1-0 aggregate lead.

De Boer said: 'I expect Dnipro to sit back and wait for us to attack. You could see that in the first match as well. We have to be patient, we can't afford to make mistakes.

'I hope this is not the "game of the year" for us, because I want to go through and play in another "game of the year".'

A 1-0 victory for Ajax after extra time would see the match go to penalties and De Boer has had his players practising penalties in training.

He said: 'We've practised penalties. From the 19 we took, we only missed about three or four. Jasper Cillessen saved two and one or two went over the bar.

'You can always train the way you kick the ball, but it's hard to simulate the atmosphere. When you saw Bayer Leverkusen last night, it looked like they didn't know that they had to take a penalty.'
