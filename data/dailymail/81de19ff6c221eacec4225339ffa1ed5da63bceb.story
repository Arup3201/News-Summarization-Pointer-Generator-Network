TalkTalk has been fined £750,000 for making an excessive number of abandoned and silent calls, which could have caused 'annoyance and distress' to consumers.

The TV, broadband and phone provider made 9,000 silent or abandoned calls to potential customers between February 1 and March 21, 2011, at two of its call centres.

The fine follows an investigation by Ofcom aiming to reduce harm caused by such calls, where individuals hear silence when they answer the phone.

TalkTalk was fined £750,000 by Ofcom for making 9,000 silent calls to customers in less than two months

It was found TalkTalk exceeded the limit of abandoned calls which organisations are permitted to make four times in 2011 during one of its telemarketing campaigns.

It also failed to ensure information messages were played, meaning consumers answered their phones and heard no sound coming from the other end of the line.

As a result, TalkTalk made approximately 9,000 silent and abandoned calls to consumers.

During another marketing campaign, TalkTalk failed to make a ‘reasoned estimate’ as to the accuracy of its answer machine detection and also failed to keep adequate records to show it complied with answer machine technology requirements.

On one day in that period TalkTalk also failed to ensure call centre workers handled cases where an earlier call made on the same day had been picked up by an answer machine.

Ofcom said TalkTalk was ultimately responsible for the actions of the two call centre operators associated with the breach, Teleperformance Limited and McAlpine Marketing Limited.

The silent calls could have caused 'annoyance or distress' to custmoers, who heard silence when they answered the phone

Ofcom's consumer group director, Claudio Pollack, said: ‘Silent and abandoned calls can cause annoyance and distress to consumers. Companies must abide by the law and Ofcom's policies. If they fail to do so then Ofcom will take firm action.

‘Today's penalty sends out a strong message to organisations using call centres that they must comply or face the consequences.’

A TalkTalk spokesman said: ‘In February and March 2011, two of TalkTalk's suppliers, Teleperformance and McAlpine Marketing, made a number of silent and abandoned marketing calls.

‘TalkTalk demands high standards from the companies it works with and as a result TalkTalk immediately stopped using these suppliers.

'Both suppliers addressed the root cause of the problem and TalkTalk will fully recover the financial penalty imposed by Ofcom from these companies.

‘TalkTalk works with all its partners to ensure that regulations are adhered to and that customers continue to get good service and best value.’

The fine against TalkTalk was welcomed by consumer watchdog group Which? as a step towards ending excessive nuisance calls directed at consumers.

Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which? said: ‘It's good to see Ofcom flexing its muscles against abandoned and silent calls.

'With so many people telling us they are being bombarded by nuisance calls and texts, we have been calling for all the relevant regulators to work together to properly police and punish those responsible with substantial fines and suspension of licences.’

Last month Which? found that in the last three months 70 per cent of people received unsolicited calls and 40 per cent got an unwanted text.
