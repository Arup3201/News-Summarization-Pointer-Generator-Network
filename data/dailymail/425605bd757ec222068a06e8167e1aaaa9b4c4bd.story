Unhappy customer: Lorraine Fisher and Creme de la Mer's Lifting Contour Serum

They’re the promise of ‘youth in a bottle’ that no woman should be without. Over the past year, you haven’t been able to open a magazine or pass a beauty counter without seeing adverts for facial serums.

Almost every cosmetics brand is doing them, from Boots No 7 to Clarins and Guerlain. These light, fast-absorbing creams are designed to be used as an alternative, or addition, to our usual skincare regimes.

The theory is that because the molecules in their formulas are so much smaller than those in a moisturiser, they penetrate deeply into the skin.

And they contain more active ingredients, vitamins and minerals than a normal face cream to help target problems such as fine lines, brown spots or oiliness.

It’s because they use more expensive ingredients that serums cost a lot (you won’t get much change out of £20 for the cheapest).

But do they work or are they just another cosmetic company plot to part us from our hard-earned cash? I decided to try one to find out.

I chose the latest on the market: luxury brand Creme de la Mer’s Lifting Contour Serum. At £230 for a 30ml bottle, it’s one of the most expensive.

It’s claimed to be ‘a high-performance sculpting serum for the face and neck’ that ‘gives skin a tighter feeling from the first touch and helps define and reshape the look of contours, significantly transforming skin’s appearance’.

The active ingredients include perennial brown algae, which has been dubbed ‘the fountain of youth’, and marine peptides (or proteins) to ‘enhance the look of skin’s density and dimension’.

To help ascertain whether it’s working during the recommended two months I sample it, I enlist London skin expert Lesley Reynolds to scan my face every fortnight using a Visia machine.

Before we start, the machine shows that for my age (I’m 44), I have incredibly few wrinkles. The machine works by comparing you to 100 women of your age group. For wrinkles, I’m in the best 1 per cent.

I also do well in the pore test — mine are quite small, which means my skin looks better.

But the machine says my face is a bit too red. It’s no surprise: I’ve always flushed easily and had pink cheeks, though I’ve thought of myself as having an English rose complexion.

Worst, though, is the sun damage — I’m in the bottom 11 per cent. While I put that down to having spent the past eight months travelling around the world in temperatures of over 100 degrees, Lesley isn’t convinced.

She says my type of skin, so pale I could be Scottish or Irish, is more prone to sun damage than darker shades.

Lorraine Fisher says: 'So it seems that Creme de la Mer was right. The Lifting Contour Serum could 'significantly transform' skin's appearance: except in my experience, it made it worse

So, even though I never sunbathe, enough has filtered through over the years to give me UV damage. It means that while my skin may be in good condition now, age may creep up quickly.

That night, I put on the Lifting Contour Serum for the first time, massaging in an upward motion as detailed in the instructions.

I also press four acupressure points (on my forehead, between my eyes, under my nose and on my chin) for three seconds each, as the instructions tell you to. This is supposed to help stimulate blood flow and improve the serum’s effectiveness.

A few minutes after I put it on, my face begins to tingle. Not unpleasantly, just a bit tickly. I’m pleased — it means the serum is actually doing something, though a quick check in the mirror doesn’t reveal a 25-year-old staring back at me.

By day five, I am seeing results — just not the positive ones I expected. My face hasn’t tingled since that first night, but my chin is dry and flakey.

The next day, my nose and cheeks start peeling and my whole face is red and patchy. That night, I slather on thick, unctuous Nivea — my go-to product when my skin’s a bit unhappy.

After a fortnight, I return to see Lesley. The results are worrying. I’m now in the top 14 per cent of British women for wrinkles — down from the top 1 per cent.

I’m horrified: the last thing I want is for this serum to damage my skin and make me look older.

 'I’m horrified: the last thing I want is for this serum to damage my skin and make me look older.'

‘Don’t worry, this sometimes happens,’ she reassures me. ‘Things get worse before they get better.’But while they might get worse, they certainly don’t get better. A couple of days later my skin feels so waxy in places and dry in others it no longer feels like mine.

By day 17, the fine lines around my mouth are no longer fine.  There’s no good news from Lesley at the halfway point nor after six weeks. I must admit that at this point I’m so furious at the thought I might be damaging my skin I want to stop the experiment.

I can’t wait to throw away the trendy green and silver bottle with its tiny writing that can be seen only by those young enough not to need Lifting Contour Serum.

But I carry on: maybe it does take eight weeks to work.

I can’t describe my relief as the trial comes to an end and I visit Lesley in her Harley Street clinic for the last time.

The Visia machine has some horrifying results for me. The only real improvement has been the sun damage (I moved from the bottom 11 per cent of British women up to 29 per cent).

‘This could be due to the fact there’s not much sun around,’ says Lesley. ‘And the serum may have helped.’

My wrinkles aren’t as good as they were eight weeks before: I’m in the top 3 per cent, down from 1 per cent.

And heaven knows what this serum has done to my pores because they’ve got much, much worse. I was in the top 22 per cent when I started this experiment; I’m now in the bottom 39pc.

But it’s the redness that’s the real problem. The day before my last Visia session, I was at a friend’s when I noticed my entire face was bright red. Not gently flushed, but pillar-box red.

‘The redness in your skin is much worse and due to a flare-up of rosacea,’ says Lesley. ‘So the serum would probably not be something that I would recommend to sensitive skin types.’

Not much is known about rosacea except that it’s incurable, though pretty harmless.

But it is embarrassing — believe me, it’s not very nice walking around with a bright red face. You feel as if everyone’s staring at you.

Lesley believes I’ve had rosacea mildly for a while, but something in the serum caused it to flare-up — we don’t know what.

She recommends a treatment called photodynamic therapy — usually used on skin cancer sufferers — which uses laser light to help reduce the redness.

I leave her office at my wits’ end. This serum was meant to help my skin, not hurt it. 

A few weeks later, my skin is still much redder than it used to be. Not all the time — it comes and goes.

I have to work out what triggers it — usually such things as heat, cold or alcohol are to blame — and try to avoid them.

In the meantime, I use thick foundation every day to try to cover it up, something I’ve never had to do before.

So it seems that Creme de la Mer was right. The Lifting Contour Serum could ‘significantly transform’ skin’s appearance: except in my experience, it made it worse.

And to think that they charge £230 for it.
