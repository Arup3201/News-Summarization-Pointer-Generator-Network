Stephen Methuen pleaded guilty to 12 charges of false accounting

A judge branded a crooked church 
accountant 'despicable' as he jailed him for five years for stealing 
over £500,000, including thousands for starving orphans.

Stephen Methuen, 57, abused 
his position of trust while working as a treasurer for his local 
evangelical church and an international relief charity.

He fiddled the accounts of Amblecote 
Christian Centre in Stourbridge, West Midlands, where he had been a member 
for 16 years, as well as the Christian International Relief Mission to 
steal a total of £517,000 over a six-year period.

His dishonesty was only discovered 
when Adrian Lowe, the church’s senior pastor and his personal friend, noticed irregularities while carrying out a financial 
assessment and called the police.

Officers discovered Methuen’s Gift Aid
claims were substantially in excess of the actual donations made and he
often added an extra zero to the figure.

He was jailed for five years
at Wolverhampton Crown Court after pleading guilty to 12 charges of 
false accounting at a hearing earlier this year and four offences of 
cheating HMRC.

Sentencing him, Judge John Maxwell 
branded Methuen 'despicable' for stealing cash intended for charities, 
including to help hungry orphans.

He told him: 'We are all familiar with
employees who steal from employers but when the victim is a charitable 
trust the consequences are far greater.

'A total of £118,000 had been raised 
by the Christian International Relief Mission to help struggling 
children in the Philippines in a desperate state of poverty.

'You used the cash to prop up your ailing accountancy business. People in this country were generous when they made donations to charity.

'When they find out that instead of 
going to a good cause the money has gone into the pocket of a dishonest 
accountant it severely tests their attitude.'

The court heard Methuen pocketed 
£195,000 after making false Gift Aid repayments and siphoned off a 
further £205,000 from the church.

He also trousered £117,000 from a 
charity called the Christian International Relief Mission which helped 
children’s orphanages in the Philippines.

Rona Campbell, prosecuting, told the 
court: 'He was simply paying out the money from the church bank account 
into his own coffers through a variety of different routes.

'He was a clever, professional, 
qualified man who used guile to systematically defraud the most 
deserving and vulnerable institutions - the church and a charity.

'He abused the trust placed in him to 
line his own pockets. He manoeuvred himself into the position where he 
had sole control of large sums of money.'

The court heard trustees of the 
charities feared they would lose their homes if the inland revenue 
pursued the stolen money but had taken a 'compassionate view' and opted 
not to try and claw the cash back.

After the case, a spokesperson for HM 
Revenue and Customs said: 'When interviewed Methuen told HMRC 
investigators he was innocent and the discrepancies were due to errors 
with computer software.

'However digital forensic analysis of computers by HMRC and West Midlands Police proved this to be a blatant lie.

'He had transferred around £517,000 to his own account and paid off his personal credit cards.'

Graham Ranson, Assistant Director 
Criminal Taxes Unit, for HM Revenue & Customs, said: 'Methuen was 
ruthless in his campaign to steal these substantial funds.

'He gained the organisations trust over a number of years and held a respected position.

'This did not satisfy him or provide 
any sense of loyalty. The Gift Aid scheme is designed to benefit 
charities, but Methuen continued to falsify business records for his own
financial benefit.

'The prison sentence handed out by the
courts today sends out a clear message that crime does not pay and the 
community will be horrified to learn he exploited and stole from these 
charities and the taxpayer, in a sustained and methodical way, over a 
number of years.'

Pastor Adrian Lowe, leader of the congregation at Amblecote Christian Centre, said afterwards: 'It is indeed a very sad day.

'No-one takes delight in the outcome; rather we can only see it as drawing a line under the events of the past few years.'
