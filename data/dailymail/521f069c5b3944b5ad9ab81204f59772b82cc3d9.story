Some of Britain's most dramatic bridges are celebrated in a new set of stamps unveiled by Royal Mail.

Ten bridges feature in the collection of first-class stamps, while a special postmark will also be issued later today.

The Menai Suspension Bridge, completed in 1826, links the island of Anglesey to the mainland in North Wales, and is described by Royal Mail as one of the most breathtaking ever built in Britain.

Andrew Hammond, head of stamps and collectibles at Royal Mail, said: 'The story of Britain’s engineering genius can be found in its bridges. 

'These new stamps celebrate 10 beautiful and ground-breaking landmarks that span centuries of our history.'
