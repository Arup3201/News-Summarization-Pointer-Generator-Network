J.K. Rowling has revealed that her time as a single mother surviving on benefits helped to inspire her latest book offering about class divides.

The Casual Vacancy begins with the 
unexpected death of Barry Fairbrother, whose demise in his early 40s 
leaves a space on the parish council in the fictional West Country 
village of Pagford.

The book features a wide variety of characters from every part of society - including a grotty council estate - and J.K. Rowling is keen to get readers thinking about how circumstances have a dramatic effect on people's outlook and on their future.

Not long to wait: J.K. Rowling's new book for adults The Casual Vacancy is released on September 27

Speaking to the Guardian about her first novel for adults, she said: 'So many 
people, certainly people who sit around the cabinet table, say: "Well, 
it worked for me" or "This is how my father managed it".

'The idea that other people might have
had such a different life experience that their choices and beliefs and
behaviours would be completely different … seems to escape a lot of 
otherwise intelligent people.

'The poor are discussed as this 
homogeneous mash, like porridge … They talk about feckless teenage 
mothers looking for a council flat. Well, how tragic is it that that's 
what someone regards as the height of security or safety?

'What would your life be like if that's 
the only possible path you can see for yourself? But I don't know if 
that's a question some people ask themselves.'

Rowling herself knows the difference 
£10 a week can make to families struggling on benefits or a low wage and
class and social status are running themes through out her novel.

Little Brown described the new book as a 'blackly comic, thought-provoking and constantly surprising' novel.

JK Rowling's Harry Potter book series was turned into films starring Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley

Global brand: JK Rowling launched Pottermore - a free-to-use website, which builds an online experience around the reading of her hugely successful Harry Potter books

It has already shot on to the best 
seller list after more than a million pre-order sales - and it's not 
even released until Thursday.

Waterstones
has revealed that the book has received the largest number of 
pre-orders this year while online orders are understood to have already 
topped more than one million.

The Casual Vacancy has been listed on 
the Amazon.co.uk bestseller list since the publishing date was announced
'on the strength of pre-orders alone'.

The recommended retail price for the 
novel is £20 but many retail outlets are offering discounts with many 
pricing it at around £10.

The novel will hit shelves on 
September 27 and book stores are predicting it will start the run of 
'Super Thursday' release days on the run-up to Christmas.

Jon Howells, spokesman for 
Waterstones, told The Independent: 'I think we will see a fantastic 
level of first day and first weekend sales and after that people will 
come to it more steadily.

'A lot of the readers will be interested in what this book can do for them.

'There was a huge sense of urgency 
with the Harry Potter books and people wanted to read them quickly so 
that they would not find out the plot through other mediums, while this 
is a standalone story.'

Rowling has now amassed a fortune 
estimated to be more than £620 million from her seven Harry Potter books
for children, plus all the spin-off rights.

The books have sold more than 450 million copies and have been translated into 74 languages.

She admits her financial independence 
has given her the opportunity to now work on whatever she wants and 
write things the way she wants to write them.

This will be her first novel since her final Potter book was published in 2007.

Popular: The Harry Potter books were so eagerly anticipated that Amazon had a 24 hour round the clock guard protecting their stock ahead of the releases

Diehard fans: Every time a book was released, Harry Potter fans would queue outside book stores for hours so they could be one of the first to read the latest installment
