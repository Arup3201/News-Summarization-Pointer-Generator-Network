The teen stowaway who survived a five-hour flight from California to Hawaii after hiding in the wheel well of a Boeing 767 was on airport grounds for six hours before the plane took off, it has emerged.

The 15-year-old boy, who has not been named, climbed over the fence at the airport in San Jose just after 1am on Sunday and the Hawaiian Airlines Flight took off at 7.55am, a federal official told CNN.

It is not known when he climbed into the plane's wheel well, but the aircraft was at the airport at 1am. He was found that afternoon on the tarmac in Maui, having miraculously survived the flight.

The teen may have been trying to get to Africa to see his mother, Hawaii News Now reported. He was living with his father, stepmother and her children in Santa Clara.

Miraculous: The 15-year-old boy who traveled from San Jose to Maui was pictured on a stretcher on Sunday. He has told authorities he doesn't want to go home

After he was found on the tarmac in 
Maui on Sunday, he told the FBI he had run away after arguing with his 
family - but on Monday, his sister denied this outside their home.

And neighbors agreed that version of 
events did not fit the quiet family who moved into the rental home on 
the tree-lined suburban street in Santa Clara six months ago.

'They are very quiet, very private,' Amy McGinn told KTVU. 'When
 I heard there was an argument, that was surprising, because I never 
hear anything, like loud noises from the house.'

McGinn
added that the boy's father drives a taxi, while the stepmother is mostly seen taking her five children to and from school.

The family did not answer the door to reporters, but a woman who claimed she is the older sister of the boy told NBC that he did not have an argument with his family.

She added that her brother was physically 'OK' after the trip, but declined to say more.

The 15-year-old boy scaled a perimeter fence at San Jose Mineta International Airport on Sunday and climbed into the wheel well of a plane with no knowledge of where the plane was heading.

The FBI has determined that the boy 
did not have any plans to threaten civil aviation, but authorities are 
questioning how the teenager breached multiple layers of security.

'This was not something he planned 
out,' FBI Special Agent Tom Simon said. 'My impression is that he ran 
for the first flight he saw... His intention was to run away from home.'

Simon said the teen climbed into the left rear wheel well of the first plane he saw in San Jose.

'He got very lucky that he got to go to Maui but he was not targeting Maui as a destination,' he said.

He
 passed out in the air and didn't regain consciousness until an hour 
after the plane landed in Hawaii, Simon said. When he came to, he 
climbed out of the wheel well and was immediately seen by airport 
personnel who escorted him inside where he was interviewed by the FBI, 
Simon said.

It was not 
immediately clear how the boy stayed alive in the unpressurized space, 
where temperatures at cruising altitude can fall well below zero and the
 air is too thin for humans to stay conscious. An FAA study of stowaways
 found that some survive by going into a hibernation-like state.

On
 Monday, authorities tried to determine how the boy slipped through 
multiple layers of security, including wide-ranging video surveillance, 
German shepherds and Segway-riding police officers.

San Jose International Airport spokeswoman Rosemary Barnes says airport employees monitor security video feeds from throughout the 1,050-acre airport around the clock.

However, she said no one noticed images of an unidentified person walking on the airport ramp and approaching Hawaiian Airlines Flight 45 in the dark until security agents reviewed the footage after the plane had landed in Hawaii and the boy had been found.

The airport, in the heart of Silicon Valley, is surrounded by fences, although some sections do not have barbed wire and could easily be scaled.

The boy found his way onto the tarmac during the night, 'under the cover of darkness,' Barnes said.

Hours later, surveillance video at Kahului Airport showed the boy getting out of the wheel well after landing, according to a statement from Hawaii's Department of Transportation. The video was not released because of the ongoing investigation.

A picture of the teen being taken away for medical care, looking awake and alert, was provided to the MailOnline by The Maui News.

A congressman who serves on the Homeland Security committee wondered how the teen could have sneaked onto the airfield unnoticed.

'I have long been concerned about security at our airport perimeters. Stowaway teen demonstrates vulnerabilities that need to be addressed,' tweeted Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who represents the San Francisco Bay Area's eastern cities and suburbs.

The FAA says 105 stowaways have sneaked aboard 94 flights worldwide since 1947, and about one out of four survived. But agency studies say the actual numbers are probably higher, as some survivors may have escaped unnoticed, and bodies could fall into the ocean undetected.

The FAA found that all wheel-well stowaways will lose consciousness at high altitude from lack of oxygen, and that their freezing bodies go into a state somewhat similar to hibernation.

At 38,000 feet - the cruising altitude of the Hawaiian Airlines flight - the outside air temperature is about minus 85 degrees. That would usually be deadly, but some people survive because their breathing, heart rate and brain activity slow down.

Staggering: The boy somehow survived unharmed while stowed in the wheel well beneath the plane

The boy was not charged with any crime and has been handed over to child protective services.

Simon said the boy was medically screened and found to be unharmed.

But news of the survival was met with suspicion, as most wheel-well stowaways don't survive the freezing temperatures and lack of oxygen.

Among the skeptics was ABC News aviation consultant John Nance, who said: 'This is a first in medical science and a first in physiology. I just don't believe it.'

Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News' chief health and medical editor, said to survive such conditions, the body has to fall into a hibernation-like state, with the heart only beating a couple of times a minute.

'It's near impossible, almost miraculous, and maybe there's more to the story,' Besser said.

Hawaiian
 Airlines Flight 24 to Oakland, California, was delayed nearly three hours 
Sunday due to the incident. The flight was scheduled to leave Kahului at
 noon and finally departed at 2:51 p.m.

A male passenger who declined to be 
identified said that he was seated on the plane to Oakland with his 
family before he was notified of the delay. He said that flight 
attendants were told to disarm the doors and that the flight would be 
delayed 10 to 15 minutes.

A Transportation Security Agency spokesman who declined to be named referred questions to the FBI and airport authorities.

In August, a 13- or 14-year-old boy in Nigeria survived a 35-minute trip
 in the wheel well of a domestic flight after stowing away.

Authorities 
credited the flight's short duration and altitude of about 25,000.

Others stowing away in wheel wells have died, including a 16-year-old 
killed after stowing away aboard a flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to 
Boston in 2010 and a 26-year-old man who fell onto a suburban London street from a flight from Angola inÂ 2012.

September 2012:
 A 26-year-old Mozambique national flying from Angola to Heathrow 
Airport in London was found dead in a suburban street under the flight 
path after presumably falling to his death as the undercarriage opened.

August 2012:
 Another man was found dead in the landing gear bay of a Boring 747 when
 it landed at Heathrow from a flight from Cape Town, South Africa.

June 2010:
 A 20-year-old Romanian man survived -41f temperatures for 100 minutes 
during a flight from Vienna to Heathrow. He survived because the plane 
stayed at 25,000 feet due to thunderstorms.

2006:
 Fidel Maruhi flew from Tahiti to LA and his core body temperature was 
79 degrees Fahrenheit when he arrived at the UCLA Medical Center for 
treatment of hypothermia and dehydration. Anything below 85 degrees 
Fahrenheit is usually fatal.

December 2002:
 Cuban refugee Victor Alvarez Molina flew four hours from Havana to 
Montreal in a DC-10 in temperatures below -41f. He survived due to a 
leaky pipe which shot out warm air and also gave him something to hold 
onto when the plane landed.
