Soldiers were recruited as part of the test which was caught on camera in the Netherlands.

A novel, if not hair-raising way, of showcasing the power of the emergency breaks on a military tank has been revealed

As they hear it tearing down the path they all look straight ahead, except for one soldier who can't hold his nerve and quickly peeks around as the tank, which is capable of reaching 42 miles 
per hour, bears down on them.

It stops at the last second in a cloud of dust and the relived soldiers all turn around and clap as the driver pops out the top.

The brake-testing stunt appeared on YouTube without explanation

The 62.3 ton Leopard 2 tank was developed in Germany in 1979 and has been used by the armies of the Netherlands, Austria, Canada, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, Poland, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Turkey and Chile

The Royal Netherlands Army used to 
operate 445 Leopard tanks, but decommissioned its last tank batallion in
 2011 as part of a programme of cuts.
