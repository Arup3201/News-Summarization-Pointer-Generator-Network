Sam Allardyce responded to David Sullivan’s analysis that West Ham have been ‘exceedingly disappointing’ by telling the co-owner not to judge his team on their form in 2015 alone.

West Ham have picked up just 11 points in the Barclays Premier League since the turn of the year but Allardyce feels the season as a whole has been a success.

The club have already beaten last year’s total by two points with seven games to spare, as was demanded of Allardyce at the beginning of the season.

Sullivan was asked by whufctv.com what he made of the season so far, and was brief in his answer: ‘The last 12 games have been exceedingly disappointing.’

Reminded that Sullivan was unhappy with West Ham’s form during his press conference, Allardyce said: ‘Is he really? In my position the game of football is about reality. The reality is, is it all about results or is it about performances?

‘The reality is, like everywhere you go, people talk about how you play. Do you play like this? Do you play like that?

‘The bottom line is the game is about winning games of football. We haven’t won enough. We’re all disappointed in the last few results. I have to keep emphasising results because performances have been right up there. This season has always been very exciting.

‘I think we can get carried away and start alluding to what this season has been just by a few games. The overall season where we are has been terrific.’

Allardyce has Enner Valencia available for selection against Stoke City on Saturday following a bizarre toe injury suffered at home, and could use his forward in the starting line-up.
