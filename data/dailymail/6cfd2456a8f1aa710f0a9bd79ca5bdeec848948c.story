There are thousands of public toilets around the world, but finding one - especially when you’re desperate - can prove impossible.

Plus, it's increasingly difficult to find one that is in working order and free to use.

The Flush Toilet Finder app was created to solve this problem. It uses your phones GPS to find nearby public conveniences around the world that are free, and those that offer disabled access.

The Flush Toilet Finder app (pictured) uses a global database of 100,000 public toilets, and a phone’s GPS location, to find nearby public conveniences. Users can search for a location and pan the Google Maps to see nearby options, as well as add any public toilets that are missing from the database

It was built by Jake Ruston, 21, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and is based on a global database of 100,000 public toilets.

Mr Ruston said he created the app in the hope it will be useful for people with conditions such as Crohn’s and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, as well as being popular with tourists and parents.

Flush is based on a global database of 100,000 public toilets. 

Users can search for a location and pan the Google Maps to see nearby options. 

Selecting a toilet provides a list of directions.

Alternatively, clicking the Directions button will take a user to the nearest toilet, without the need to search.

Users can add public toilets that are missing from the database, and results can be filtered to show those that charge a fee or need a key. 

App also shows toilets with disabled access.

Within the first two weeks of launch, the free app has been downloaded more than 10,000 times.

Mr Ruston, who studies at University of East Anglia’s School of Computing Sciences, said: ‘The app accesses your GPS location to locate all the public conveniences in your area.

‘[It] also provides information about whether toilets have disabled access, whether people need to obtain a key for access, and whether the facilities are free or not.’

The 21-year-old got the idea after developing an app for the London Underground.

‘A lot of people were asking me to include details of toilet facilities for London, but I decided to go bigger and design something for the whole world.’

Mr Ruston combined information from several sources in order to successfully provide the necessary data for his users.

The app also allows users to add locations of toilets which may not already be listed.

Mr Ruston added: ‘There have been times when I’ve been in other countries such as Germany and I’ve needed to find a toilet, which has been difficult to locate due to obvious language barriers and unfamiliarity with the area.

‘I’ll be listening to user feedback about Flush Toilet Finder and will add what people suggest, so I’m grateful for all of the support users have shown to the app so far.’

The app is now available for free from iOS and Android app stores.
