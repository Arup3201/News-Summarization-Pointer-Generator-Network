Toll lanes to relieve the congested road network are to be built as part of a major Government drive to kickstart the economy.

Firms will be asked to construct dedicated ‘express lanes’ alongside busy sections of motorways and trunk roads.

Drivers using the lanes would be billed per journey, with the profits going to the private sector.

Vision of the future: Drivers queue to pay at the M6 toll road booths at Great Wyreley, near Cannock, Staffordshire. A plan to introduce toll lanes across the motorway network is to be proposed by the Government today

Ministers, desperate to get more private sector cash into the economy, believe that by creating extra lanes, the scheme conforms with their pledge not to introduce tolls on existing roads.

But the sight of wealthy drivers speeding past could cause resentment among less affluent motorists who already pay massive taxes to be on the road.

The initiative is being actively considered as part of the Government’s ‘growth review’ which will be unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne next week.

Today David Cameron and Nick Clegg will announce a package of initiatives to kickstart the moribund housing market.

These include a £400million fund to build 16,000 new homes and a scheme to underwrite the deposits of first-time buyers.

Later they will thrash out the final elements of the growth review with Mr Osborne and the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander.

Sources close to Nick Clegg last night said it was vital for both the economy and the Coalition that the review is a success.

One said: ‘This is a big moment for the Government.

'We have to show not just that we can cut the deficit, but also that we can get growth going again.’

Other elements being considered in the growth review include:

Treasury sources indicated last night that the plan for toll lanes is likely to be introduced in a limited form. Roads under consideration include the notorious A14, which links the Suffolk port of Felixstowe and the M11 and A1 to the M1 and M6.

Will toll lanes relieve congestion?

The dual carriageway has long been a major bottleneck, slowing cargo from the Midlands to the Felixstowe docks.

Experts believe automatic numberplate recognition technology could be used to bill motorists who use the new lanes without the need for toll booths. Fines would be levied on drivers who stray into the express lanes.

A source at the Department for 
Transport confirmed that the Government’s pledge not to introduce tolls 
on existing roads does not cover ‘new capacity’.

Some
ministers are concerned, however, that the scheme could be seen by the 
public as a ‘slippery slope’ towards the wider introduction of road 
tolls.

John Cridland, director general of the CBI, called on ministers to bring forward the initiative, and said firms were ready to invest millions immediately.

Mr Cridland said: ‘Let’s have the A14 
widened by road tolling so the Government doesn’t have to pay. It is 
money on my members’ balance sheets that pays in return for an income in
future years.’

But Keith Peat of the Association of British Drivers said: ‘We pay £50billion a year in motoring taxes, of which only £7billion goes back into motoring. Many drivers will feel we deserve the very best highways and should not have to pay extra.’

In a major speech to the CBI today, David Cameron will pledge to build a ‘new model of growth’ amid fears that the eurozone crisis could drag Britain back into recession.

He will say: ‘Put simply, Britain must become one of the best places to do business on the planet.’
