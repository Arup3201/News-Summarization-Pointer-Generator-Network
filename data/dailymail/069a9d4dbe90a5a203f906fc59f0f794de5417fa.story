League One high-flyers Preston booked their place in the fourth round of the FA Cup as they saw off Championship opposition in the shape of promotion-chasing Norwich at Deepdale. 

Paul Gallagher's second-half double was enough to send the Lilywhites through.

Ricardo Fuller's late equaliser spared Millwall's blushes by securing an FA Cup third round replay with League One side Bradford City after a thrilling 3-3 draw.

Fuller struck in the 83rd minute to complete a quick-fire double for the Championship outfit - adding to Scott McDonald's first-half goal - that cancelled out Sid Nelson's own goal and Billy Knott strikes in either half.

Bournemouth came from a goal down to knock Championship rivals Rotherham out of the FA Cup.

The Cherries made eight changes, but it did not matter as they ran out 5-1 winners with Yann Kermorgant scoring twice as Shaun MacDonald, Junior Stanislas and Ryan Fraser also on target.

Cambridge reached the fourth round for the first time in 15 years after beating Luton.

Robbie Simpson’s first-half goal put the hosts in the ascendancy before Ryan Donaldson, returning from an injury lay-off, doubled Cambridge's advantage on 66 minutes.

Michael Harriman struck late on for Luton but it ultimately proved to be a mere consolation for the visitors.

Jelle Vossen celebrates giving Middlesbrough the lead in a comfortable win against Barnsley

Former Huddersfield midfielder Oliver Norwood shot down his old club with the vital pass which secured a 1-0 win for Reading in the FA Cup third round tie at the John Smith's Stadium.

Norwood, a £1.2million buy from Town in August, threaded the ball through for substitute Nick Blackman to drill Reading into the fourth round and settle a largely disappointing game.

Elsewhere, second-half goals from Jelle Vossen and Daniel Ayala gave Middlesbrough a 2-0 win at Barnsley in an FA Cup tie they dominated. 

On-loan striker Matt Smith scored for the third game in a row to earn League One leaders Bristol City a replay after a draw at Doncaster.

The former Leeds United striker, on loan from Fulham, headed home a 75th-minute equaliser after Doncaster had looked the better side for most of the match.
