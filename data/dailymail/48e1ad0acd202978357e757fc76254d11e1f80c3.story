With her glowing skin and toned physique, Millie Mackintosh is a walking advert for the healthy lifestyle she preaches.

And now, the former Made In Chelsea star will be sharing the secrets behind her virtuous lifestyle at the capital's most fashionable health festival.

Millie will be joining her healthy pals at the Well Fit festival, which is described as 'a one-day concept festival in the heart of Shoreditch, showcasing the dream-team of London's health and fitness experts.'

Get her glow: Millie Mackintosh is a poster girl for the healthy lifestyle and now the clean living guru will be on hand at London's latest health and fitness festival to share her secrets

The party girl-turned-health-guru, who has swapped cider for chia seeds, will be showing festival-goers exactly how to emulate her clean and green lifestyle and demonstrating how to make her prized raw courgetti with kale pesto.

The festival, taking place at Frame in Shoreditch Studios on October 4, is the brainchild of Millie's good friend and trainer, Russell Bateman. 

Russell runs the Skinny B**** Collective (SBC) - an elite and intense 50-minute circuits style class that has attendees, including Suki Waterhouse, crawling on their hands and knees and doing one legged burpees, because it helps her 'release her inner animal'. It has fast become the capital's most fashionable workout.

Get the look: The festival, called Well Fit, is the brainchild of Millie's good friend and trainer, Russell Bateman, who runs the Skinny B**** Collective, where Millie and her friends Laura Whitmore and Zara Martin work out

'Well Fit was an opportunity to curate a wellness festival which would include my pick of the health and wellbeing community,' Russell told MailOnline.

The £100 event, which aims to be a fusion of fitness and food, will see The Good Life Eatery, the Detox Kitchen and The Pressery catering, while classes including yoga and barre will run throughout the day.

The likes of Vogue editor Calgary Avansino, Honestly Healthy's Natasha Corrett and Millie's best friend Madeleine Shaw, a trained nutritionist, will be on hand to offer expert advice and demonstrations designed to inform and upgrade attendees' lives.

He continued: 'I've chosen people who I believe are the brightest lights in London who can offer the most amazing insights, education and empowerment. Add that to some amazing eateries on offer and you'll leave feeling completely upgraded.'

Breakfast 

Hot water and lemon

Rye bread with mashed avocado, chilli flakes and 2 poached eggs for breakfast

Mid-morning maybe a carrot and ginger juice

Lunch

Superfood salad with chicken, broccoli, butternut, mixed leaves

Afternoon after a work out - a protein shake with coconut water

Dinner  

Stir fry with tiger prawns, mixed veg and buckwheat noodles

Frozen yoghurt and blue berries with grated dark chocolate for pudding

Millie, who works out with Russell regularly, takes her healthy regime very seriously and is currently penning her own lifestyle book.

Speaking to MailOnline about her involvement with the event, Millie said she thinks health festivals will become big business.

'It's a great way for people to learn about looking after themselves, health is so huge in the states and we are catching up now in the UK,' she said. 

'People want to know how to better themselves from the inside out.' 

Attendees can learn how to do the upside down burpee that Millie makes look effortless on her Instagram page.

'Don't try it straight after lunch!,' she warns. 'They seem really hard at first but get easier if you do them regularly.' 

While Millie cites omega-3 rich chia seed puddings as one of her favourite snacks, she also allows herself the occasional treat and loves 'a good slice of cake, especially polenta.' 

So has husband Stephen (a.k.a. Professor Green) picked up on her healthy lifestyle?

'To be honest he was into healthy eating before I was. When I got into working out before the wedding I realised how important nutrition was.' she said. 

Just whip it! Burberry model Suki Waterhouse often posts snaps and videos of herself working out at the SBC class

Speaking about juicing, the 24-year-old said: 'Cleansing is about general well being and health rather than losing weight. There are so many additional benefits for skin and energy too.' 

Speaking about getting Millie on board, Russell said: 'She's definitely become a leading figure with some of the routines and recipes she posts. 

'Millie has a huge following and is changing young girls' perceptions about training and nutrition. She eats healthily and trains like an athlete whilst still keeping her femininity.'  

So does Russell think we'll be skipping Glastonbury next year in favour of a more virtuous option?

'I think this is the most special event so far. The sheer amount of wellness and educational factors in one place at the same time can only be good for the future. You'll definitely leave feeling revitalised and inspired.'
