On Earth, free-burning and smouldering fire can usually be put out with water.

But in space – where there is no up or down – fire behaves in bizarre ways creating spheres of floating flames.

Now, a new Vine recently posted by astronaut Reid  Wiseman, has revealed this incredible phenomenon in action.

Flames in space burn with a lower temperature, at a lower rate, and with less oxygen than in normal gravity. 

This means that materials used to extinguish the fire must be present in higher concentrations. 

The slow flow of air from the fans mixing the air in a spacecraft can make the flames burn even faster.

To help understand how flames burn in space, Flex researchers ignite a small drop of either heptane or methanol.

As this little sphere of fuel burns for about 20 seconds, it is engulfed by a spherically symmetric flame. 

The droplet shrinks until either the flame extinguishes or the fuel runs out.

‘A floating sphere of fire comes alive in Flex-2 @ISS_Science – may lead to better engines on Earth,’ wrote the 38-year-old from Baltimore who is currently serving as flight engineer aboard the International Space Station. 

On the ISS - which is the size of an American football field - putting out even a small fire quickly is a life-and-death matter.

For several years, Nasa's Flame Extinguishment Experiment, or Flex, has conducted more than 200 tests to better understand the fundamentals of flames and how to control them in microgravity.

When a flame burns on Earth, heated gases rise from the fire creating a buoyant flow that draws oxygen into the flame and combustion products away from it. This creates a flame shape.

‘In space molecular diffusion draws oxygen to the flame and combustion products away from the flame at a rate 100 times slower than the buoyant flow on Earth,’ Dan Dietrich, project scientist, Nasa’s Glenn Research Center, said.

Flame Extinguishment-2 (Flex-2) is the second iteration of the Flex experiment and requires the flaming droplets to be suspended, free of other objects.

This allows astronauts to better study the rate at which fuel mixtures evaporate and burn, as well as understating the conditions required for soot to form.

Nasa claims that ‘understanding these processes could lead to the production of a safer spacecraft as well as increased fuel efficiency for engines using liquid fuel on Earth.’
