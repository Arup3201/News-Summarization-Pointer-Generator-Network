A 12-year-old girl who is accused of trying to kill her friend to honour Slender Man still believes in the fictional character six months on, her attorney says.

Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier have been charged with attempted murder and face up to 65 years in prison for allegedly stabbing their friend 19 times after a sleepover in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on May 31.

The girls reportedly planned the crime to demonstrate dedication to Slenderman, a character who appears in stories on the website Creepypasta.

Morgan's attorney said Tuesday that her mental state has not improved and he will challenge a state doctor's determination that she is fit to stand trial.

Wisconsin Judge Michael Bohren ordered the girl to receive mental health treatment in August after a state psychologist testified the child claimed to see and hear things that others could not, including Slender Man, unicorns and characters from the Harry Potter and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. 

A different doctor filed the latest report on her condition, which was sealed by the court.

Victim: Payton Leutner, pictured on ABC in September, had stayed at a sleepover with her two friends the night before and was lured to a wooded area the next morning. She managed to crawl for help after the attack

Defense attorney Anthony Cotton said Geyser still believes fictional characters are real, and he would have a doctor he hired testify about that during a December 18 hearing.

'We don't think anything has changed in terms of her functioning,' Cotton said.

The case cannot proceed unless Bohren is confident the girl can understand and help with her defense.

The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009.

The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit.

The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia.

It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport.

It is understood to have originated in a photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009.

It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'.

Cotton said the treatment Geyser has received at a mental health institution is 'markedly better' than the care she had before August, when she was held in jail.

'Right now, she has one-on-one care, she has social workers, she has doctors, she has therapists,' he said.

'There's professionals who can look at her and monitor her and be involved in the sort of day-to-day treatment. 

'Jails aren't equipped to do those types of activities, and they're certainly not equipped to do those things for children in most cases.'

Geyser would likely be sent back to jail if Bohren found her fit for trial, Cotton said.

According to court documents, the pair plotted for months before attacking Payton Leutner during a walk in a wooded park following a May 30 sleepover in Waukesha, about a half-hour west of Milwaukee.

The victim, who was stabbed 19 times, survived by waiting until her attackers left and then crawling to a path where a bicyclist found her. 

All three children were 12 at the time.

The two girls were found walking toward a national forest where they believed the specter lived in a mansion.

The second girl charged in the attack also has a December 18 hearing scheduled on her mental state. 

Wisconsin law requires suspects in severe crimes to be charged as adults if they are at least 10.
