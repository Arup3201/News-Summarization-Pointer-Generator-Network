Busted: Branden Mattier, 22, was arrested when police say he accepted a fake check for $.2.2million from an undercover officer after filing a bogus claim with the Boston bombing victims' fund

A Boston man has been arrested after police say he used the name of an aunt who had been dead for more than a decade to try and claim about $2.2million from the Boston Marathon bomb victims fund.

The Massachusetts Attorney General's office said Branden Mattier, 22, told the fund's administrators that his aunt, Onevia Bradley, lost both of her legs in the attack on April 15 when two improvised pressure cooker bombs exploded at the finish line, killing three people and injuring 264 others.

But Miss Bradley the aunt had been dead for more than 10 years and Mattier was arrested at his home in Boston when an undercover police officer presented him with a fake check for $2.2million, prosecutors said.

‚ÄòBecause every dollar was allocated to victims, he sought to take these funds away from real victims of the Marathon attack and from the thousands of people who had so generously given to help those who truly need it,‚Äô Attorney General Martha Coakley said in a statement.

Mattier, an aspiring rapper and self-described film maker, is being charged with attempted larceny and identity theft. He is expected to be arraigned Wednesday.

The marathon bombing victims‚Äô fund, called The One Fund, was established by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. It has so far brought in more than $62million in donations, according to its website.

The fund is being managed by Kenneth Feinberg, an arbitration attorney who also oversaw compensation for victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the theater shootings in Aurora, Colorado.

Coakley said The One Fund flagged Mattier‚Äôs claim because it appeared ‚Äòa little unusual,‚Äô and passed it on to her office earlier this month.

According to a press release from the Attorney General's office, the investigation revealed that on May 7, Mattier attended a Town Hall meeting at the Boston Public Library on behalf of his supposedly injured aunt.¬†

Three weeks later, he followed up by sending an email to The One Fund asking if his aunt could make a claim as a double amputee if the amputation was expected to be performed in the future.

'In June, The One Fund received Mattier‚Äôs claim form along with a letter allegedly from the chief of trauma services at the Boston Medical Center affirming his aunt as a double amputee,' the release stated. 'The letter was dated May 2, a full 27 days before Mattier‚Äôs email.'

According to officials, the letter from the hospital was a forgery, and that Mattier‚Äôs aunt was never treated there.

Mattier, who goes by the stage name The Real Soulja Boy, posted a photo May 7 on his Instagram account of himself posing with an administrator from The One Fund, accompanied by the caption: 'Just spoke with Feinberg about what we can provide to help the city move forward in this tragedy, he loved it. #OneFundBoston #Boston #BostonMarathon [new inner city developments on the way.] üôè #ss'

In another image uploaded that same day, Mattier is seen holding paperwork at the offices of The One Found. The caption for this photo read: 'Big Meeting w/ The One Fund Boston, & Kenneth Feinberg, Re-Building The City After The Bombing. #Boston #OneFund'
