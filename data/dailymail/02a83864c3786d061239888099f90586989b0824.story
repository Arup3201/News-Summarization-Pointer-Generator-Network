Manchester United's £750million kit deal with adidas means nobody is off limits this summer - and that includes Lionel Messi.

Louis van Gaal is expected to go on another spending spree after splashing out £156m when he arrived at Old Trafford.

And with cash from the world-record deal with the German sportswear giants set to drop into the club accounts after the end of this season, money is no object.

Manchester United's new kit deal with adidas means nobody is off limits this summer - including Lionel Messi

Manchester United will end their 13-year deal with Nike at the end of the current campaign  

Louis van Gaal is expected to go on another spending spree in the summer

A source close to the 10-year agreement told Sportsmail: 'It's no secret that after this, nobody is off limits'.

Messi, 27, hinted that he may leave Barcelona when he was named runner-up to Cristiano Ronaldo at the Ballon d'Or in Zurich, stating: 'I don’t know where I’ll be next year.'

Reports in Spain had claimed adidas, who sponsor the man who has won the award four times himself, would help fund a £200m move.

That is unlikely. Decisions over recruitment are solely the domain of the club and Messi has played for the Nike-sponsored Catalan giants throughout his career without conflict.

However, the source said that United's agreement with adidas may well make them an attractive proposition for the Argentina star.

'It certainly would not hinder it,' they added.

Old Trafford is seen as the only possible destination should Messi end an emotional 14-year stay at the Nou Camp.

United are arguably the only club that can match Real Madrid's financial muscle and a switch to Barcelona's deadly rivals is unthinkable.

Both Manchester City and Chelsea are restricted by UEFA's Financial Fair Play restrictions while there are no such issues for United chief executive Ed Woodward.

However, it is understood that senior officials at the Etihad Stadium believe that nobody would be able to prise Messi away from Barcelona until the latter stages of his career.

The player is at home in Catalonia and is thought to be reluctant to leave such a settled environment behind.

The Old Trafford club failed in a huge bid for Gareth Bale in 2013 before he moved to Real Madrid

United, who spent £57.9m on Angel di Maria to break the UK record in the summer, failed in a huge bid for Gareth Bale in 2013 when the Spurs winger opted to go to boyhood idols Real Madrid for a world-record £85m.

Despite not qualifying for the Champions League, United made £8.9m in the first quarter of the financial year and continue to sign new commercial deals across the globe.

On Tuesday, they announced an agreement with KamaGames - who joined a long list of partners by becoming United's social games partner - and when money from adidas lands they are expected to hit a new level of financial power.

Real Madrid - Real’s agreement with adidas, which runs until 2020, was widely reported to be the most lucrative in world football before United announced their deal with the same firm.

Barcelona - Barcelona announced in 2007 that their deal with Nike, initially signed in 2006, was being extended until the end of the 2017-18 season. The original contract was worth a minimum of £24million a year.

Arsenal - This is the first season of Arsenal’s deal with Puma, which was announced in January as the biggest contract in both parties’ history.

Chelsea - Chelsea and adidas signed a 10-year deal last June worth almost £300million.

Man City - City switched from local firm Umbro to Nike last season in a six-year deal announced in May 2012.

Liverpool - In January 2012, Liverpool announced a six-year agreement with American firm Warrior. The deal is reportedly worth £25million a year to the Reds. Warrior general manager Richard Wright said at the time: 'We are here to shake up the world of football.'

Bayern Munich - Bayern Munich and adidas extended their collaboration beyond the 50-year mark with a new deal in 2011 that runs until 2020. Adidas also owns a stake in the club.

England - The Football Association ended a 60-year association with Umbro by switching to Nike. A five-year deal to run from 2013 to 2018 was announced in September 2012. The figure was not made public but the FA described it as 'a substantial investment'.'

NFL - Nike replaced Reebok as the official supplier of kit to the National Football League in 2012 in a five-year deal that is the most lucrative in US sport.
