The engagements’ diary of a Second World War army general has revealed that he wrote off the week of the D-Day landings by scribbling a line through it.

General Sir Miles ‘Bimbo’ Dempsey made notes of top secret meetings he held with Allied commanders in the weeks and months leading up to and after the week beginning June 6, 1944 in the black book.

But the diary was mysteriously 'cleared' from the two pages covering Monday, June 5 through to Sunday, June 11, with a simple blue squiggly line across those dates.

The engagements' diary of a World War Two army general has revealed that he wrote off the week of the D-Day landings by scribbling a line through it. Sir Miles 'Bimbo' Dempsey made notes of top secret meetings he held with Allied commanders leading up to and after the week beginning June 6, 1944 in the black book

A modest man, Sir Miles was one of the most important wartime generals but is almost completely unknown because of his determination to stay out of the limelight. Sir Miles is pictured (right) alongside King  George VI (centre) and Field Marshal Montgomery (left)

It is not clear why Sir Miles erased the days, but for
 every day after the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe, Gen 
Dempsey marked in pencil ‘D+1’, ‘D+2’ and so on and also noted which 
divisions of his army had landed.

The mysterious gesture comes to light as hundreds of surviving D-Day veterans prepare to revisit the beaches of Normandy to mark the 70th anniversary of the landings.

Events to commemorate the historic invasion of northern France will take place across the UK and also around the pivotal beaches themselves - code-named Utah, Omaha, Sword, Gold and Juno.

Dignitaries including the Queen, as well as 650 British veterans of the conflict, will visit France for events.

A modest man, Sir Miles was one of the most important wartime generals but is almost completely unknown because of his determination to stay out of the limelight.

He went from Major to General - in charge of half a million troops - in just six years, and was the first person since Agincourt to be knighted on the battlefield by the King himself.

His diary is among an archive of documents and photographs relating to the commander of the largest British Army in history to be released by his family - including several letters of 
congratulations sent by Generals Dwight Eisenhower and Montgomery for his
martial success.

Andrew
 Currie, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'The Dempsey material offers a 
wonderful opportunity to highlight the career of a soldier who in many 
ways became the forgotten man of D-Day.

'The
 many warm letters of congratulations from Eisenhower and Montgomery 
show just how much they valued his calm leadership of the huge 2nd Army 
and in particular the way he approached the unglamorous task of pinning 
down the German troops and tanks in the immediate aftermath of D-Day.

'Unlike
 most of the senior figures involved in D-Day, General Dempsey did not 
write his memoires so the tributes from his fellow offices have a 
special significance.

'They 
speak loudly and impartially for the vitally important contribution he 
made both then and during the rest of the war in which he served with 
such distinction.

'General 
Dempsey was the focal point of one of the stranger episodes at the very 
end of the war when a delegation of high ranking German military 
personnel, acting on the authority of the interim German government, 
arrived at his HQ on June 3, 1945 to negotiate the German surrender.

'The
 set of four photographs recording this event is a vivid reminder of the
 chaos which surrounded the collapse of the German state after Hitler’s 
suicide on April 30.'

The collection also includes a rare order of service for a church service held on June 4, 1944, to say prayers for the tens of thousands of men about to take part in D-Day.

The landings on June 6, 1944 involved a combination of British, Canadian, American and French forces, including hundreds of units from the Royal Navy.

About 132,000 Royal Marines and Allied soldiers were transported by ships and injected onto the beaches of Normandy by landing craft and sea boat.

More than 23,000 arriving by air, according to the Ministry of Defence, and the RAF and allied air forces provided air support with 11,000 aircraft.

D-Day was the largest seaborne invasion ever launched and opened the gateway to victory for the British and allied forces to bring the Second World War to an end.

Around 10,000 troops and civilians were killed but the actual figure has never been discovered.

To mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day, an international flotilla of ships will sail through the channel to Normandy before an international ceremony on Sword Beach.Services led by the British and the French will be held at Bayeux Cathedral followed by an event at the Bayeux Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery.

It also includes four unofficial photos of the moment the German high command tried to surrender to him at his headquarters in Germany on May 3, 1945.

General Demspey sent the German deputation away as, by protocol, they had to surrender to Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery, which they did the following day.

And a signed photo of US army supremo Eisenhower in which he described ‘Bimbo’ as ‘brilliant army commander of World War II’ is included.

He led the British 2nd Army in the Battle of Normandy, where his men occupied the German forces at Caen, allowing the Americans to push into northern France.

His family have decided to sell some of the wartime mementos ahead of the 70th anniversary of D-Day. The archive has a pre-sale estimate of almost £40,000.

Gen Dempsey retired from the army in 1957 and hunted and bred race horses. He died aged 72 in 1969. The auction takes place on June 26.

Commemoration: Former Allied soldiers are set to gather in Normandy this week. U.S. veteran Jack W Schlegel, 91, is pictured above teaching boys in Normandy about his role in the fighting

Recreation: Historical re-enactors, with authentic-looking vehicles and uniforms, are also preparing to mark the landings

Memories: Mr Schlegel, who served in the 82nd Airborne unit of the U.S. Army, poses in front of a road which was named after him

Practice: The events of this weekend in Normandy will be attended by leaders from all over the world
