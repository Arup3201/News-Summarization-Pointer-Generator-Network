A primary school with more than 400 pupils has become the first in the country where no children speak English as their mother tongue.

Punjabi Urdu, Portuguese, Czech, Polish, Russian and several African dialects are among the 20 foreign languages spoken at Gladstone Primary School.

But it has thrived in the face of adversity. Only 14 months ago the school was rated ‘inadequate’ by Ofsted, the lowest of four ratings. Last month it was upgraded to ‘good’, the second highest.

Lesson in diversity: Christine Parker with some of her pupils, who between them speak 20 foreign languages

Gladstone Primary School headteacher Christine Parker chats with her pupils. She oversees what is the most multi-cultural school in Britain, with not one of the 440 pupils listing English as their first language

The school, in Peterborough, has 
adopted a string of measures to cope. Teachers give ‘running 
commentaries’, explaining everything they are doing so that pupils 
associate objects and actions with the words that describe them.

A ‘buddy system’ is also in place with
 children in schools over the border in Lincolnshire so that pupils can 
benefit from having friends who are native English speakers. Pupils 
study and play together at each other’s schools once a fortnight.

Teachers are motivated by salaries 
that are linked to their performance, something Education Secretary 
Michael Gove is introducing across the country from September in an 
attempt to drive up standards.

Gladstone Primary is believed to be the first in Britain where every single one of its pupils does not speak English as a first language, but more and more pupils across the country are now from foreign backgrounds.

In a 2012 census of 1,600 schools, it was found English-speaking children are now in a minority, with the figures particularly startling in the 14 inner London boroughs, where there were 98,000 non-native English speakers compared to 78,000 who could list the language as their number one.

Nationwide, there were 97 schools where the number of pupils speaking English as a mother tongue was fewer than one in 20 of the school population.

After London, Birmingham had the highest concentration of 'foreign' pupils, followed by Bradford and then Leicester.

Punjabi was the most widely-spoken first language.

Head Christine Parker, 54, said: ‘More
 and more of the world is  going bilingual. The culture at our school is
 not to see bilingualism as  a difficulty.’

Often, she added, it is preferable for
 children to speak no English  at all, rather than turn up with a 
mixture of English and their parents’ language.

‘Sometimes parents have tried to help 
their children learn English but their own isn’t too good,’ she said. 
‘The outcome is the children aren’t fluent in their own language. If 
they haven’t got a good foundation [in their own language] it can be 
very difficult to build on that.’

Some 358 of the 440 pupils were raised
 speaking Punjabi Urdu, according to Department for Education figures. 
The language is used in parts of Pakistan and India.

Another 23 are fluent in Dari, which 
is used in Afghanistan, Iran and Tajikistan. There are 15 Lithuanians 
and 11 Latvians, while other languages include Portuguese, Polish, 
Slovakian, Czech, Gujarati, Russian, German, Pashto, French, Arabic and 
four African dialects.

The different language groups are 
accommodated using 28 teaching assistants, ten of whom speak Urdu.Mrs 
Parker, who speaks some Urdu after living in Pakistan with her teacher 
husband Stephen in the 1990s plus some French and German, said: ‘Some 
children like to start trying out what they have learned straight away.

‘Others have a silent period of  up to
 six months while they are taking things in. Then they start to  talk 
with some fluency. It’s lovely  to hear.’

Beeches Primary School, which is also 
in Peterborough, has 23 native languages spoken among its 592 pupils. 
Only 24 children have English as a first language.

Despite the language barrier, Gladstone Primary School has been rated 'good' by inspectors just a year after it was deemed 'inadequate'

Several nationalities migrated to 
Peterborough in the last century, including Pakistanis and Italians. The
 city also saw a huge influx of Eastern Europeans from 2004 when the EU 
expanded and is now believed to be the fastest growing multi-ethnic 
community in Britain.

By 2007 there were 16,000 Eastern 
Europeans estimated to be living there, one in ten of the population. 
Many of them arrived to work on farms and in food processing plants in 
the agricultural heartland.

Peterborough City Council said more 
than 100 languages are spoken in the area. More than a third of pupils 
speak English as a second language, up from one in five in 2008.

The city’s Conservative MP, Stewart Jackson, has warned that it is struggling to cope with the new arrivals.

More are expected as families leave London because of the Government’s cap on housing benefits.
