A landlord was battered to death in a street brawl after a punter insulted him over the quality of his beer, a court heard.

Richie Williams, 64, who was the landlord of the Fur and Feathers in West Derby, Liverpool, died after receiving a fatal punch from customer Matthew Connah.

The grandfather-of-ten was found unconscious with serious injuries following the attack in the early hours of August 11 and was taken to Aintree University Hospital, where he died a short time later.

Connah, 38, today admitted a charge of manslaughter at Liverpool Crown Court after prosecutors dropped a murder charge against him, saying there was 'no realistic prospect of conviction'.

John Benson, QC, prosecuting, told the court that the brawl happened a short time after Mr Williams and Connah had shared a drink in his social club.

Connah and his friend David Needham had left the club as Mr Williams locked up, but were eventually caught up by the landlord and his friend, Peter Nolan.

Mr Benson said: 'Unhappily, the prosecution say, the defendant made some disparaging remarks about the quality of the beer in the premises.

'Mr Williams took umbrage and went over to remonstrate. We can't be entirely clear as to what happened when Mr Williams went over to the defendant but it resulted in the deceased striking the defendant with a blow to the face.'

Mr Williams and Mr Nolan walked away but were followed by an 'irate' Connah, who threw a bottle at Mr Williams which missed and smashed on the ground nearby.

Mr Benson said: 'He [Connah] was not going to let the matter lie. He equipped himself with what appears to be a chair leg and then approached Mr Williams and Mr Nolan with the chair leg. He was menacing with it and shouting at them.

'He was persisting with his question "why did you do that?". Questions which were shouted and overheard by people occupying various properties.

'The defendant approached with the chair leg. Mr Nolan told him to put it down and Mr Williams said "come on, one-to-one", and a crucial feature of this case is that the defendant did put the chair leg down.

'Then both men, the defendant and the deceased, met in the middle of the road and traded blows.

'The deceased struck a blow to the defendant and the defendant went to the floor. The defendant got up and struck a blow which put the deceased on the floor.

'Mr Williams wilted. He was an older man than the defendant. The defendant is a stronger, taller man.

The altercation occurred outside the Fur and Feathers Bar in Liverpool (pictured) on August 11.Â Connah, 38, today admitted a charge of manslaughter at Liverpool Crown Court and will be sentenced on February 18

'At the end of that altercation there was a flurry of very heavy blows delivered by the defendant.'

Mr Williams collapsed on the floor as Connah left the scene, telling him 'don't come around to my house in the morning.'

Mr Benson said that was an indication that Connah did not know he had delivered a fatal blow.

'In the circumstances the prosecution has taken a view that it would be appropriate in all the circumstances to accept the defendant's plea of guilty to manslaughter,' he said.

He told Mr Justice Edis that Mr Williams' grieving family were 'entirely understanding' of the decision not to proceed with the murder charge.

Connah, of Liverpool, was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on February 18.
