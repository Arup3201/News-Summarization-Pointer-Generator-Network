Cold Feet and Spooks star Hermione Norris says that she shops from Asda's Smart Price range because British television drama roles don't pay much

A star of hit drama Cold Feet has claimed that British television pays so poorly that she has been forced to shop for groceries from Asda's Smart Price range.

Hermione Norris, 46, says that times have got tough for TV actresses since she starred as stressed middle-class mother Karen Marsden in the ITV series.

Despite earning a reported £75,000 per episode for the final series of the popular programme in 2003, she now says been reduced to Asda's cheapest produce.

'It's quite a different industry now and the money has gone down hugely. So there's still quite a bit of Asda Smart Price going on in my life,' she says in an interview with Reader's Digest, seen by the Daily Telegraph.

'I think perhaps if you work in America, the fees are still very good. But my life is here and I love British drama. And, you know, there is a part of me that would rather eat beans than find myself working in something that I didn't believe in.'

Her stance is quite a turnaround from comments made the year before last, when she told the Daily Mail in an interview that one temptation she couldn't resist was 'buying for a family of ten in Waitrose'.

'I'll happily spend an hour there and rack up a bill of £300,' she said at the time.

In that same interview she revealed that her 'prized possession' she values 'above all others' was the Aga at her second home in Dorset.

'It cost £10,000 to put in ten years ago, but was worth every penny. It’s the heart of the home – it makes amazing roasts, dries clothes and I even sit the kids on it to warm them up!'

Norris and her producer husband Simon Wheeler spend most of their time at their spacious city home in West London, where they live with their children, Wilf, nine, and Hero, six.

She first came to prominence in ITV comedy drama Cold Feet in 1997, a show that may well have been Hermione's final chance to make it as an actress.

Work had been sporadic before she was offered the role of posh alcoholic Karen Marsden, and Norris – whose parents split when she was four, leaving her mother, Helen, to bring up four children – had seriously considered ditching acting for a career as a lawyer.

But since her star turn in the hit series she has worked pretty much constantly, with roles in wire In The Blood, Kingdom and Spooks.

She has said of her action packed role in the spy series: 'It was bizarre, sometimes, to go home and bathe the children after being blown up in Spooks, or having been in bed with another actor.

'But I always try not to let work invade my time with my children. I try to find the right balance between work and home life.

'I think it's a myth that women can have it all. They can't! It's always a juggling act.'

Now Norris is set to appear in two new prime-time series on BBC One: Crimson Field, a drama set in a field hospital during the First World War; and In The Club, which follows the lives of a group of mothers-to-be.
