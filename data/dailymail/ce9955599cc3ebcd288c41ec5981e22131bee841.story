Luis Suarez faced further criticism on Monday night after issuing a belated apology for biting Giorgio Chiellini and promising never to be involved in such an incident again - just as Barcelona stepped up their bid to sign him.

Four days after receiving a four-month ban from the game and telling FIFA that the clash during Uruguay’s World Cup match against Italy in Natal was an accident in which he ‘lost balance’, the Liverpool striker made a complete U-turn and admitted he deeply regretted his actions. But the apology has led to widespread cynicism in the week that the 27-year-old was linked with an £80million move to the Nou Camp.

Gary Lineker, the former Barcelona striker, claimed the Catalan giants had insisted that Suarez say sorry if any potential transfer is to go through.

In the statement issued on Twitter, 
Suarez said: ‘After several days of being home with my family, I have 
had the opportunity to regain my calm and reflect about the reality of what occurred during the Italy-Uruguay match on 24 June 2014.

‘Independent
 from the fallout and the contradicting declarations that have surfaced 
during these past days, all of which have been without the intention of 
interfering with the good performance of my national team, the truth
 is that my colleague Giorgio Chiellini suffered the physical result of a
 bite in the collision he suffered with me.

‘For this: I deeply 
regret what occurred. I apologise to Giorgio Chiellini and the entire 
football family. I vow to the public that there will never again be 
another incident like this.’

Juventus defender Chiellini 
retweeted Suarez's apology on his own site, having previously said the 
four-month ban issued to Suarez should not have been so severe.

Chiellini also replied to the Tweet directly, saying 'It's all forgotten. I hope FIFA will reduce your suspension.'

He
 had previously said: 'At the moment my only thought is for Luis and his
 family, because they will face a very difficult period.

'I have 
always considered unequivocal the disciplinary interventions by the 
competent bodies, but at the same time I believe that the proposed 
formula is excessive. 

'I sincerely hope that he will be 
allowed, at least, to stay close to his team mates during the games 
because such a ban is really alienating for a player.'

Suggestion: Lineker says Barcelona may have forced the apology upon Suarez in order for a transfer to occur

Although Barcelona have not yet submitted a 
formal bid, Liverpool are expecting contact soon, and, as Tottenham did 
when selling Gareth Bale to Real Madrid last summer, will hope to bring in new recruits before agreeing any deal.

Brendan
 Rodgers is set to complete the £25million signing of Southampton’s Adam
 Lallana on Tuesday and is close to agreeing a £9.8m move for Belgian 
striker Divock Origi, while Benfica’s Lazar Markovic is also a target.

Suarez’s
 apology came just hours after Uruguay’s president Jose Mujica had waded
 into the row by launching a foul-mouthed attack, calling FIFA ‘a bunch 
of old sons of b*****s’.

The 79-year-old described the 
punishment, which also included a suspension for nine international 
matches, as a ‘fascist ban’. He made the comments to state TV at a 
reception for the Uruguay team, following their elimination from the 
World Cup by Colombia on Saturday.

The
 president covered his mouth to feign shock at what he had said, but 
told journalists to ‘publish it’ when asked if he wanted to rectify his 
remarks.

Mujica admitted that Suarez deserved to be disciplined, but 
said his suspension was too harsh. ‘They could have punished him, but 
not given him this fascist ban,’ he said.

If he remains at Liverpool, Suarez will miss the first nine games of the league season and return to action on October 26.
