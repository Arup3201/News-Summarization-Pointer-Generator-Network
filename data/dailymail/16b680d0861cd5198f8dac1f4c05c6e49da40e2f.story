Abandoned: 26-year-old mother Rebecca Stoltz was arrested Sunday night after fleeing a Walmart and leaving her two young daughters behind

A mother caught shoplifting at a Walmart in Florida on Sunday was arrested after leaving her crying children behind in the store.

Rebecca Stoltz, 26, only returned to the store when pressured by police, and has since been charged with both theft, child abuse and child neglect.

Stoltz was shopping at the DeLand location around 8:30pm when store employees witnessed her stuffing $44 worth of women's clothing into a plastic bag.

Loss prevention officers stopped Stoltz, so she handed over the items, fled through the garden department and drove away in her silver Nissan to resist arrest.

But she left behind both her 6-year-old daughter and 9-year-old step-daughter who store employees found 'clearly distressed' and both crying.

Stoltz called a friend to come and pick up her daughters, but that friend met police when she arrived at the store.

The woman would not give her name to authorities, but did provide them with a number to contact Stoltz.

Officers tried showing up at Stotlz's home, but found that the address on her driver's license was not her current residence.

When they 
called Stoltz, they told her to come back to the store but she said she 
did not have transportation, despite driving off in her own car.

She
 showed up at the store sometime later where shew as arrested and 
charged with child abuse, neglect of a child and first-degree petty 
theft.

On Monday she was being held at the Volusia County Branch Jail on $3,500 bail.

Her children are now in the care of a family member.
