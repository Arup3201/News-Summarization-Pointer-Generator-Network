A Ryanair flight was diverted 200 miles to another airport away from its Greek holiday island destination because the pilot said it was 'too dark to land'.

Passengers on the flight from London Stansted to Kefalonia were furious when they were told their plane would have to be diverted.

They ended up at Thessaloniki airport on the Greek mainland at night because of the problems.

'Too dark': The Ryanair flight to Kefalonia landed 200 miles away after passengers were told it was too dark to land at the airport

People on board initially thought the plane had run out of fuel until the pilot made his announcement.

Eventually they were able to take off again and fly on to their destination after a two-hour delay.

Passenger and journalist Kate Mansey, who was on the flight, Tweeted: 'On a @ryanair flight that has just landed in the WRONG Greek island. Excuse? "Too dark" to land in correct airport. Furious passengers.'

She claimed planes were only allowed to land at the airport during 'daylight hours' - although the plane was scheduled to land at 9.20pm.

When they were finally given the all-clear to travel on to their destination late at night a passenger asked 'Has the sun come up in Keffalonia then?'

Ms Mansey added later: 'Apparently we're now taking off again for our original destination of Keffalonia. Maybe they have found a torch. Well done.'

A spokesman for Ryanair blamed 'runway approach restrictions' for the delays.

Destination: The Greek holiday island of Kefalonia which the plane was heading to

'Ryanair flight FR6611 from Stansted to Kefalonia on 13 May diverted to Thessaloniki due to runway restrictions which prevail over Ryanair night time flights into Kefalonia.

'The aircraft landed normally at Thessaloniki and repositioned to Kefalonia (2 hours later) once this restriction was cleared. Ryanair sincerely apologises to passengers affected by this two hour delay.

'Ryanair has altered the scheduled timings of its Kefalonia flights to ensure that this night time landing restriction will not recur.'

The budget airline's twice-weekly flights to Kefalonia only launched on April 1.
