The front rows of London Fashion Week 
shows are traditionally reserved for A-List celebrities and editors, and while we 
can't promise you a seat next to Anna Wintour we CAN give you a ringside view of the event's first fashion fabulous catwalk show as Fearne Cotton unveils her spring/summer 14 range.

The
 Very.co.uk designer's catwalk show will be streamed live on MailOnline 
as it takes place on Thursday, 12th September, from 6pm.

This is 
Fearne's twelfth collection and fifth catwalk show for fashion website Very.co.uk and we are expecting a starry 
guest list, bucketloads of champagne and some seriously cool clothes.

Fearne's spring/summer collection moves towards a fun, eclectic style, drawing its main inspiration from the 1970s. 

Continuing to build on last season’s designs she has told us that the range fuses clashing colours and prints including leopard print, sunflowers, vintage florals and canary brights.

'For spring/summer 14 I really wanted to keep an edge to my collection but add in an element of fun through print, pops of colour and quirky detail.

'I also wanted the pieces to be versatile and wearable, swing dresses are perfect for this as you can dress them up or down and the peek-a-boo neckline adds a playful element to the garment,' said Fearne.

The key is in the detail this season with contrasting collars and lace finishes featuring throughout the collection.

Swing dresses and raglan sleeves also feature prominently as well as jersey and lace day wear maxis and New York trench parkas.

The collection also houses classic rock‘n’roll staples such as stonewash jeans and black crop tops.

'I actually designed this collection before I had Rex so to see it finally come to life is amazing!' said Fearne.

A spokesperson for Very.co.uk said: 
'Being a digital department store means we have to find innovative and 
exciting ways of showcasing collections to our customers and Fearne’s 
show is a prime example of how we make great style accessible to 
everyone.'
