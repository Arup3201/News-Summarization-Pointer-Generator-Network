Walmart is considering a radical plan to have customers visiting their stores deliver packages to online buyers on their way home, it was revealed today.

Asking customers to deliver goods would put the world's largest retailer squarely in middle of a new phenomenon sometimes known as 'crowd-sourcing,' or the 'sharing economy.'

The company hopes the plan will help it compete with online rival Amazon, which has expanded from an internet bookstore to practically corner the market in all online shopping.

Such an effort would, however, face numerous legal, regulatory and privacy obstacles, and Walmart executives have admitted it is still at an early planning stage.

Walmart is making a big push to ship online orders directly from stores, hoping to cut transport costs and gain an edge over Amazon and other online retailers, which have no physical store locations.

The company does this at 25 stores currently, but plans to double that to 50 this year and could expand the program to hundreds of stores in the future.

Walmart currently uses carriers like FedEx Corp for delivery - or, in the case of a same-day delivery service called Walmart To Go that is being tested in five metro areas, its own delivery trucks.

'I see a path to where this is crowd-sourced,' said Joel Anderson, chief executive of Walmart.com in the U.S., in an interview with Reuters.

Walmart has millions of customers each week, some of whom could tell the retailer where they live and sign up to drop of packages for online customers who live on their route home, Mr Anderson explained.

In return, Walmart would offer a discount on the customers' shopping bills, effectively covering the cost of their petrol in return for making the deliveries, he added.

'This is at the brain-storming stage, 
but it's possible in a year or two,' said Jeff McAllister, senior vice 
president of Walmart U.S. innovations.

However,
Matt Nemer, retail analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said the 
likelihood of the plan being broadly adopted across the Walmart's 
network of more than 4,000 U.S. stores is low.

'I'm sure it will be a test in some stores,' he said. 'But they may only keep it for metro markets and for higher-priced items.'

Start-ups such as TaskRabbit and 
Fiverr already let individuals rent out their time and expertise to 
companies and people looking for small jobs to be completed.

Zipments
was founded in 2010 as a crowd-sourced delivery network that allowed 
anyone over 18 years old with a vehicle, a text-enabled phone, and a 
PayPal account to bid on courier services for local businesses.

Such
online match-making businesses often push legal boundaries - and a 
Walmart crowd-sourced delivery program would be no different, according 
to Mr Nemer.

Online packages delivered by customers may never reach their destination, either through theft or fraud, he said.

Such
a crowd-sourced delivery service may not be as reliable as FedEx or 
United Parcel Service, which have insured drivers, he added.

'You
are comfortable with a FedEx or UPS truck in your driveway, but what 
about a stranger knocking on your door?' Mr Nemer said.

The Amazon Phoenix Fulfillment Centre in Goodyear, Arizona: Walmart hopes to gain an edge over internet rivals, which have no shops, by shipping goods sold online from its network of 4,000 stores across the U.S.

While Zipments started out with a pure crowd-sourcing approach, the company now does more screening of drivers before allowing them to be part of its delivery network, chief executive and co-founder Garrick Pohl said.

Theft, fraud and late deliveries have never been a problem, but insurance and licenses were an obstacle, Pohl explained. Drivers often need personal liability insurance to cover package delivery activities. Cargo insurance is also needed.

Zipments self-insures this risk up to $250, but the firm encourages its couriers to buy additional coverage for higher-value packages, Mr Pohl said.

In some areas, like downtown Chicago, people also need a courier license to deliver things, he added.

'Zipments now helps people get all these things set up before allowing them to deliver goods,' Mr Pohl said.

Still, he said the issues are not insurmountable, citing pizza restaurants, which have used part-time drivers to deliver food for years.

'It's a great solution for large retailers like Walmart,' Mr Pohl said. 'We'd like to see them move quicker, but it's great that they are considering it.'

Zipments is trying to provide such services to retailers, although Mr Pohl declined to say which companies the start-up is talking to about this.
