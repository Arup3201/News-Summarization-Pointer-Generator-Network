His late mother sparked an international outcry 13 years ago when she walked through a minefield to highlight the shocking legacy of anti-personnel landmines.

Now Prince Harry has taken on Princess Diana’s mantle by becoming patron of the 25th anniversary appeal of the organisation she championed, the Halo Trust.

The 28-year-old prince will support the Dumfriesshire-based charity, which has cleared 1.4million mines since being set up in 1988, throughout its landmark year.

In his mother's footsteps: Prince Harry, left in Mozambique, will become a patron of the 25th anniversary appeal of the Halo Trust, a mine-clearing charity first supported by his late mother, Princess Diana, seen right in Angola

Diana highlighted the work of the Halo Trust less than eight months before she died, when she was  pictured wearing a face mask and protective clothing during a visit to a minefield clearance in Angola in January 1997.

But her subsequent calls for a worldwide ban on landmines sparked an international row over the impartiality of the Royal Family.

Support: The prince visited minefields in Tete Province, Mozambique, in 2010 with the charity

Government ministers reacted with fury, with the then Junior Defence Minister, Earl Howe, describing the princess as ‘ill informed’ and ‘a loose cannon’.

The princess rejected their 
criticism, insisting she was not a political figure but wanted to 
highlight the scale of the humanitarian disaster.

‘I’m
only trying to help,’ she said, as she cuddled landmine victim Sandra 
Txijica. The image went round the world, forever linked to Diana and a 
powerful symbol of the horrors of war.

Harry first followed the example set by mother when he visited Mozambique in 2010 to learn about Halo’s work.

During
that trip, not only did he meet people who had lost limbs to landmines 
but he was given the chance to detonate mines himself, wearing the same 
protective visor and body armour as she did.

He has, according to aides, been looking for a way to support the charity more formally ever since.Guy
Willoughby, Halo’s chief executive officer, said yesterday: ‘Many 
people don’t realise that wars might be over but people are still being 
killed and maimed by landmines every day – there were 4,000 victims of 
landmines in 2011.

‘Prince
Harry’s invaluable support will help us raise awareness of this 
important issue so we can raise funds to recruit and train more  
de-miners to get more landmines out of the ground more quickly.’

A
St James’s Palace spokesman said: ‘Prince Harry takes a keen and active
interest in Halo’s work and is delighted to support the charity in its 
25th year.’
