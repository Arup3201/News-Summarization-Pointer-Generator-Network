Conservationists are testing technology which could use the ‘gaps’ between digital television channels to monitor endangered wildlife in remote areas.

Experts are testing so-called television white space (TVWS), which can be transmitted over long distances, and through obstacles such as trees, to send footage from remote cameras.   

It is hoped that the vacant frequencies will allow conservationists in the field to accurately monitor areas such as rainforests or deserts, where it has previously been difficult to study wildlife.

For now, it is being trialled a little closer to home - in London Zoo. 

Cameras and radios have been installed in animal enclosures to test the use of TVWS by wirelessly transmitting video live to YouTube, using Google’s ‘spectrum database’ to make sure they do not interfere with existing channels.

Members of the public will be able tune in and see what the otters, meerkats and giant tortoises are getting up to 24-hours a day during the two-month trial period.

‘With projects in more than 50 countries around the world, ZSL’s conservationists work in some of the planet’s most difficult-to-reach areas, from the vast expanse of the Saudi Arabian desert to the dense jungles of Sumatra,said Louise Hartley , ZSL’s ‘white spaces for wildlife’ project co-ordinator.

‘Remote monitoring of wildlife is a vital conservation tool, from helping us to better understand a species’ behaviour to detecting activity such as poaching or illegal logging.

TVWS stands for television white space.

It could be used to ransmit data over long distances and through obstacles such as trees, to send footage from remote cameras.

‘The prototype systems at ZSL London Zoo are already demonstrating that they can transmit high definition video over long distances, confirming their invaluable potential to use wireless connectivity to transform ZSL’s worldwide conservation work.’

ZSL said it aims to integrate the technology into its existing ‘instant wild’ system, which is used for anti-poaching and wildlife monitoring operations. 

This system allows members of the public to help identify wild animals photographed by motion-activated camera-traps.

Using television white space could significantly boost the range, and capability, of this current system, ZSL said.

The scheme is one of a number of trials of new wireless technology, with broadcasting regulator Ofcom working with the industry to see how it might be put into practice - making the UK the first country in Europe likely to use it.

Other trials include using TVWS to provide early flood warnings, by monitoring water levels in real time and sending the information over the white space, and using the technology to provide internet and communications to ferries in the far north of Scotland.

Philip Marnick, group director of Ofcom’s spectrum policy group, said: ‘In a world where consumers’ demand for data services is experiencing huge growth, it is essential we find the most efficient ways to share the airwaves.

‘White space technology could be one way of meeting this demand.’
