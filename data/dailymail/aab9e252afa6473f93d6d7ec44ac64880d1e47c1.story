Louis van Gaal admits he is no closer to knowing Manchester United’s best formation after seven months in charge at Old Trafford.

Van Gaal has reverted to a defensive back four and a midfield diamond in recent games, coming under fire for playing England striker Wayne Rooney in a deeper role.

Former United favourite Paul Scholes described watching his old club as ‘miserable’ and criticised their negative tactics, although Van Gaal refused to be drawn into a public row at his weekly press conference.

Van Gaal admitted he still doesn't know what his best Manchester United formation formation is 

However, when asked if he knows his best system, the United boss said: ‘No, I don’t think so. I have played now already five or six systems and I am looking still for the balance.

‘But this system is more attractive and I can play with more attacking players. That’s the reason I am doing that.

‘In spite of the fact that we are looking for the balance, our results and our defensive organisation are not bad, and we also score a lot of goals. So, I cannot say that I am very disappointed about that.’

Three days after he arrived to face the media armed with statistical evidence to counter claims from West Ham manager Sam Allardyce that United are turning into a long ball team, Van Gaal resisted the temptation to hit back at Scholes over his comments.

They followed United’s unconvincing win at home to Burnley on Wednesday that extended their current run to just one defeat in 18 games but drew widespread criticism.

Van Gaal sidestepped the Scholes issue, however, saying: ‘I don’t worry about that, it’s not so interesting.

‘Paul Scholes is one of the fans and fans can criticise us, that’s not a problem. That’s all I have to say on that.

‘I am used to it and I think all the players are used to it because they are not first time professional football players.

‘Maybe some players are affected, but normally most of the time it does not affect me or the players.’

United are away to Preston North End in the FA Cup fifth round on Monday night, and Van Gaal revealed that Phil Jones, Daley Blind and Robin van Persie are all doubts for the tie at Deepdale.

Jones and Blind both went off before half-time against Burnley with knee and head injuries respectively, while Van Persie’s problem is unknown.

Van Gaal said: ‘Jones is not a heavy injury but it will be difficult for him. We’ll have to wait and see how Blind recovers and Van Persie has something. I gave the players the day off and only the injured players are in.’

Having already faced lower division opposition away in the last two rounds, the United boss knows what to expect from League One Preston.

‘The FA Cup is fantastic,’ said Van Gaal. ‘You know the world is against you because everybody is for the underdog.

‘The chance you can survive is higher because you are playing against lower quality but you have to beat a team with big motivation.’

Manchester United will also be without Daley Blind who was also injured during the win against Burnley
