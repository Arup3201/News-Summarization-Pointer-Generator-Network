Erica and James Packer were pictured together for the first time since they separated last year as they attended the funeral of Australian billionaire Paul Ramsay and the couple seemed to be on very good terms.

The 36-year-old model and her beleaguered ex-husband, 46, were seen boarding a private helicopter to fly down to Bowral to attend the funeral early on Friday morning.

They were accompanied on the 40-minute flight by Seven Network chairman Kerry Stokes, who owns the helicopter, his wife Christine Simpson Stokes, and his son Ryan Stokes.

Paul Ramsay was a businessman and philanthropist who died at the age of 78. It is believed he suffered a heart attack in Spain in April, though he was flown back to Australia and passed away in Bowral.

Also in attendance at St Thomas Aquinas church were Prime Minister Tony Abbott, former Prime Minister John Howard, former cricketing great Brett Lee, former Wallabies star John Kearns, radio host Alan Jones, federal minister Barnaby Joyce and the governor-general Peter Cosgrove.

Radio host Alan Jones greeted Erica with a playful punch to the cheek. The greeting was no doubt playful, but came a little too close after her ex-husband's public brawl to pass by unnoticed

Shortly after the Packers took seats in the pews, former prime minister John Howard and wife Jeannette arrived and signed the register. Mr Ramsay was  a devoted supporter of the Liberal Party and in 2011-2012 he was its biggest donor, contributing more than $600,000 to the party.

Governor-General Peter Cosgrove and his wife Lady Lynne arrived at the chapel just before 11 o'clock and gave a polite smile to the crowd gathered outside.

During the funeral Prime Minister Abbott, gave a brief eulogy.

'Here's the thing, Paul built a business empire but he never lost his soul,' he said. 'He was the most un-Scrooge like billionaire Australia has ever seen.'

Former prime minister John Howard said the late medical entrepreneur had a 'radiant decency' during a speech he made to the mourners off the cuff.

'He epitomised ethical capitalism,' said Mr Howard. 'His business acumen in not only private health but in media was well respected. He was an inspirational Australian and there is I think no finer epitaph.'

Members of the public also turned up to catch a glimpse of the star-studded funeral.

'I hope I get a seat, there's a lot of celebrities in today,' said local Innika.

Millionaire hotelier Justin Hemmes was also spotted outside the church with his girlfriend Carla McKinnon and his German Shepherd.

Paul Ramsay, 78, was the founder and chairman of Ramsay Health Care, a private hospital operator.

Ramsay Healthcare has more than 150 hospitals in Australia, the UK, Indonesia, Malaysia and France.

Mr Ramsay was valued at $3.7 billion by Forbes in March.

He was an ardent support of the Liberal Party and of former prime minster John Howard. Mr Ramsay was the party's most significant donor in 2011-2012, giving $605,000 one year.

It was announced on April 24 that he was admitted to hospital in a serious condition, it was believed that he suffered a heart attack in Spain while sailing.

Mr Ramsay was flown back to Australia and died in Bowral on the evening of May 1.

He was single and had no children, and is survived by his brother Peter Oscar, twin sister Anne and brother-in-law Brian, as well as nieces and nephews.

The company announced Mr Ramsay's stake in Ramsay health, worth $3.3 billion, will be left to his charitable foundation.

Neither James nor Erica took communion during the service, remaining inseparable as the prime minister helped himself to the bread and wine.

James Packer filed out behind the coffin, with his arm around his ex-wife's waist and appeared to shed tears as he exited the church.

Press had gathered outside the church to catch sight of the celebrities inside, and a visibly frustrated James Packer told them: 'Guys it's somebody else's funeral, it's not cool.'

When asked by media if he thought his fight with Mr Gyngell last week had overshadowed Paul Ramsay's funeral, he replied tersely: 'Excuse me? I'm here for Paul Ramsay who was a great man.'

Erica Packer flew into Australia on Thursday morning  with her youngest child Emmanuelle, 20 months so she could attend the funeral of the billionaire.

Erica is currently based in Los Angeles where she lives with the couple's three children.

According to The Daily Telegraph, Mr Ramsay remained a firm supporter of Erica - who is also known by her maiden name Baxter - following her split from Packer in September.

Ahead of the funeral, the former Mrs Packer decided to take the opportunity to visit some friends yesterday - most notably the wife of David Gyngell, Leila McKinnon.

The pair met on Thursday afternoon, just days after the brawl between Mr Packer, 46, and Mr Gyngell, 47.

The fight followed a heated text message exchange because Packer believed a camera crew from the network run by Gyngell was trying to catch him with rumoured lover, model Miranda Kerr.

Gyngell had gone to the $20million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure casino owner he was not under surveillance by Nine Network television cameras.

On Friday, the pair were given criminal infringement notices for offensive behaviour, a penalty which carries a fine of $500 if it goes uncontested by the recipient.

The case stalled earlier in the week due to the fact neither Packer nor Gyngell lodged an official complaint over the incident.

At the funeral, Mr Packer's left eye was still visibly puffy and bruised from the fight and in a further reminder of the public fight Alan Jones greeted Erica with a playful mock punch to the chin.

Police have announced that both Mr Packer and Mr Gyngell will be fined $500 over the incident.

Neither Mr Packer nor Mr Gyngell have lodged an official complaint over the incident, yet Mr Gyngell took responsibility for the fight in a statement.

'[Mr Gyngell] fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident. He respects the job police do and will co-operate fully with their investigation,' it said.

The incident stemmed from an angry text message exchange between the two men, after Mr Packer thought a camera crew from the network was trying to film him with rumoured flame Miranda Kerr.

Ms Kerr was at Sydney airport on Thursday morning at the same time as Ms Packer - while the casino boss's ex arrived, his speculated new love interest was said to be flying to Shanghai.

The scuffle does not seem to have affected the relationship between Erica and Mr Gyngell's wife, Leila Mckinnon, whom the model visited on Thursday afternoon.

The TV reporter and Ms Packer are close family friends. Mr Gyngell was best man at the Packers' wedding in 2007, and Mr Packer was best man at Mr Gyngell's wedding to Ms McKinnon in 2004.

Ms McKinnon's eighteen-month-old son Ted was born just one month after Ms Packer's youngest daughter Emmanuelle.

Ms Packer, who has three children with the billionaire casino mogul, looked calm and collected on Thursday when she was spotted meeting up with friends in Sydney. The 36-year-old jetted in from Los Angeles where she is now based, on Thursday morning carrying Emmanuelle as they made their way through the terminal.
