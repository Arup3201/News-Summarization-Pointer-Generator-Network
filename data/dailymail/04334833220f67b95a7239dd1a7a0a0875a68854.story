Online hit: Navy pilot Christopher Gotke crash-landed one of Britain's last surviving Sea Furys

His skilled crash-landing of a stricken Second World War fighter in front of horrified air show spectators made him a YouTube sensation.

Now Lieutenant Commander Christopher Gotke's bravery has been recognised by military chiefs - with the award of the Air Force Cross. 

The 44-year-old said he was 'shocked and amazed' to receive the medal for his careful flying during the incident on July 31 last year despite serving in the Royal Navy for his entire 23-year career.

The pilot was flying a Sea Fury T20 from 1944 in an aerobatic sequence  when its engine began to lose power.

He responded immediately by lowering the landing gear and positioning the aircraft for landing, while informing air traffic control that he was in trouble.

While he tried to carry out the manoeuvre the engine failed completely, with 21,000 people watching on in horror as the Sea Fury billowed smoke and rapidly lost altitude.

In a split second, Lieutenant Commander Gotke decided to fly the aircraft to safety rather than eject and abandon the machine to its fate.

By raising the undercarriage he improved the plane's chances of gliding and smoothly handled the plane past the airfield boundary, avoiding disaster.

Although it was partly damaged, the aircraft is now being repaired and will fly again 'some time next year'.

A video of his landing  has been viewed more than 339,000 times.

'It looks a lot more dramatic from the outside than it felt from the inside,' he said. 'When I was bouncing across the grass it was just like being in a bumper car. 

'The safety of the crowd was never a factor because the aircraft was fully controllable.'

Horror: Thousands of air show spectators in Cornwall watched last July as the plane developed a fault mid-air

Skill: The experienced pilot decided to try and save the plane at great personal risk instead of ejecting

The father-of-two, who is stationed in Yeovilton, Somerset, joked that his wife Georgia and daughters were only third on his list of calls after the incident.

He said: 'The first people I called were the people who look after the aircraft, to tell them I was now looking at a very sad aeroplane on the side of the runway. They thought I was joking.

'The second was the Commodore at the base, saying "Well, that didn't end up very well".

'And the third one was to the wife saying "Had a slight engine issue, won't be back tonight but I won't be flying this weekend".

'I don't think she was really listening because the kids were playing havoc in the background.

'I said I'd had a rough running engine and she kind of acknowledged it a little bit, but when I called her back I said it was a bit more than just a rough running engine.'

Wobble: The plane bounced off the runway like a 'bumper car' before the undercarriage collapsed completely

Come to rest: The pilot, who has been awarded the Air Force Cross, joked his wife was only his third phone call

Rescue: The plane suffered extensive damage but restoration experts are optimistic that it will fly again

There are still three to four Sea Fury planes in the UK.

First manufactured by Hawker towards the end of the Second World War, it was the last propeller-driver fighter to serve with the Royal Navy.

It was also one of the fastest production single piston-engined aircraft ever built.

The Air Force Cross is awarded for 'an act or acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying, though not in active operations against the enemy'. 

The pilot was one of 139 men and women from the Army, Navy and RAF who were named on the full Operation Awards list today.

The recipients were represented by 14 of the most prominent in a ceremony yesterday at London's Lancaster House before being welcomed at 10 Downing Street.

They included Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey, who has become only the second living soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross since 1969.

The 27-year-old also became the second person in his family to be awarded the medal – his second cousin was given the honour 70 years ago. 

Under fire from 20 Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, the paratrooper raced to give first aid to a wounded officer. 

Prime Minister David Cameron said he was 'humbled' by the bravery and dedication of the men and women.

'It is absolutely right that Lance Corporal Leakey has been awarded a Victoria Cross,' he said. 'He epitomised valour with his actions on that hillside in Helmand.

'When you hear how events unfolded and the intensity of enemy fire, it is difficult to imagine how one wouldn't be frozen to the spot and yet Lance Corporal Leakey risked his life to run across that barren hillside not just once, but multiple times, to turn the battle and save the lives of comrades.

'That is why he deserves the highest honour for bravery the nation can give.'
