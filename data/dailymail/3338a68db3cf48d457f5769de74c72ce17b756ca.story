The estranged wife of one of three terror suspects accused of plotting a huge suicide bombing attack offered to be the group's 'fourth lion', a court heard today.

Salma Kabal allegedly told her husband Ashik Ali, 27, that she could be the 'lioness' of the group - a reference to the black comedy film Four Lions, which concerns four incompetent jihadists.

Ali, Irfan Naseer, 31, and Irfan Khalid, 27, are accused of planning an attack bigger than the London bombings which killed 52 people on July 7, 2005.

Woolwich Crown Court in London has 
heard that the home-grown terror cell wanted to kill up to 2,000 people 
by detonating eight rucksack bombs in crowded areas.

Ms Kabal, who was trying to reconcile
 her relationship with Ali, is not accused of being involved and did not
 know what the group were allegedly planning as her husband repeatedly 
withheld the truth from her, prosecutor Brian Altman QC told a jury.

Ali told his wife he was planning on fighting jihad abroad and said he did not want to get her involved, the court heard.

He said he still loved her but 
repeatedly said they could not be together and warned her she would not 
be able to adapt to fighting jihad abroad, making reference to the 
threat of drone strikes, the hearing was told.

References to Four Lions and the 
Olympics, were important as they suggested there were three people 
involved in the plot and that the plan was to carry out an attack in the
 UK, Mr Altman said.

The three men are accused of engaging
 in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, which they deny. They were
 allegedly part of a plot involving 11 men.

Naseer is accused of five counts of 
the offence, Khalid four and Ali three, all between Christmas Day 2010 
and September 19 last year.

For Naseer, from Sparkhill, Khalid, 
from Sparkbrook, and Ali, from Balsall Heath, all in Birmingham, this is
 alleged to have included planning a bombing campaign, collecting money 
for terrorism and recruiting others for terrorism.

Naseer and Khalid are also accused of
 travelling to Pakistan for training in terrorism, and it is alleged 
that Naseer also helped others to travel to the country for the same 
purpose. The trial continues on Friday.

Today the jury heard a series of 
secret recordings from Ali's flat - an alleged 'bomb factory' - in which
 men could be heard branding westerners 'animals' who want to 'have sex 
like donkeys on the street' before boasting: 'Why shouldn't we terrorise
 them?'

The group are also heard discussing plans to get 'three of four brothers' to do a 'second whack' after their deaths.

No targets had been pinpointed and 
police arrested eleven men and one woman in September last year before 
the plan could be realised, the court heard.

Naseer, who allegedly trained in terror camps in Afghanistan with Khalid, is heard talking about the first UK attack.

He adds: 'And get another three of four brothers and do a second whack, you get me, later on. That's the thing, that's the one.'

In the extracts the trio are also heard justifying their actions and referring to Westerners as 'animals'.

The jury heard Naseer allegedly said:
 'They wanna have sex like donkeys on the street, they wanna club, act 
like animals and why shouldn't we terrorise them, tell me that?'

'You think about it, if someone came 
in your house yeah and started dancing and throughout the night and 
started basically having orgies and smoking drugs and stuff...you would 
terrorise them ainit.'

Naseer also tells the others that to 'give your life' while carrying out a jihad was the 'greatest thing'.

The men deny the charges and the case continues.
