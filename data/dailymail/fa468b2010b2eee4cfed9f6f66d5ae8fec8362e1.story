For 15 years, the makers of racing game Gran Turismo have created cars so outlandish they’d never feasibly make it in the real world - until now.

Volkswagen has taken the designs for a GTI Roadster, destined to appear in the next installment of the PlayStation game, and turned it into a reality.

The supercar has 20-inch alloy wheels, a top speed of 190mph (306 km/h) and goes from 0 to 60 in under 3.6 seconds.

Volkswagen has taken the designs for a GTI Roadster, destined to appear in the next installment of racing game Gran Turismo, and turned it into a reality. The supercar, pictured, has 20-inch alloy wheels, a top speed of 190mph (306 km/h) and goes from 0 to 60 in under 3.6 seconds

The GTI Roadster supercar has 20-inch alloy wheels, a top speed of 190mph (306 km/h) and goes from 0 to 60 in under 3.6 seconds. 

The angular-looking GTI Roadster has a large spoiler and is fitted with a 3-litre, twin-turbocharged V6 engine.

This develops 500bhp and 413lb ft of torque to propel the car’s kerb weight of 1,420kg.

It additionally has a seven speed DSG gearbox and Volkswagen’s 4MOTION all-wheel-drive system.

Elsewhere, the car doesn’t have a roof.

This puts it on par with the Ferrari FF, for example.

It has been on display at the Woerthersee car show in Germany this week, but sadly the model that’s been built is a one-off concept. 

Volkswagen said it has no current plans to put the supercar into mass production, and make it widely available.

The GTI Roadster is the work of three Volkswagen designers, who won an in-house competition to design a vehicle to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Gran Turismo.

Klaus Bischoff, head of design at Volkswagen, said: ‘When Sony asked us if we would develop a Vision GT vehicle exclusively for the game to mark the 15th anniversary of Gran Turismo we didn’t hesitate for a moment.’
