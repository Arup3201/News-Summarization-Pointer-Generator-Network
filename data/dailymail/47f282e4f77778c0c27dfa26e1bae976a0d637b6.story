Patrick Neal Schumacher being breathalysed by police after he was seen weaving in and out of traffic while riding his horse Dillon

A drunk Colorado man has been arrested after attempting to ride a horse 600 miles to his brother's wedding with a dog in his rucksack and a beer in his saddlebag.

Patrick Neal Schumacher was stopped by police on Monday after he was seen weaving in and out of traffic while riding his horse Dillon through the city of Boulder, Colorado, it is claimed.

The 45-year-old, who was spotted 'slumped' on the animal at around 2.14pm, was asked to dismount by officers and given a field sobriety test, which he failed.

He wasÂ also discovered to be carrying a pug named Bufford in his backpack and a small black powder pistol and beer in one of his saddlebags.

Schumacher, from Colorado Springs, told University of Colorado police he was trying to make a 600-mile journey from Larkspur to Bryce, Utah, to attend his brother's wedding.

He said he had decided to make the trip by horseback as he had previously lost his driver's licence.

According to The Daily Camera, eye-witnesses called the police after seeing the pair wandering into the road, dodging traffic and forcing people off the pavement.

They also reported seeing Schumacher repeatedly strike Dillon so hard that he 'reared up on his hind legs'.

However, the drunken rider has claimed he had been 
smacking flies off the animal's head.
