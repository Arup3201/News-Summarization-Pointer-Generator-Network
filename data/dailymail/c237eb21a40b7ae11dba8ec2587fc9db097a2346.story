An Oregon high school student has captured a video of his school bus driver apparently falling asleep at the wheel. 

Nicholas Sayre, a 17-year-old junior at Lincoln High School in Portland, told The Oregonian that he noticed the driver's tendency to doze off weeks ago.

'The guy keeps falling asleep. It's just not safe,' Sayre told the Oregonian. 'Everybody screws up, but don't do it with 20 kids on your bus.'

An Oregon high school student has captured a video of his school bus driver (seen in the rear-view mirror) apparently falling asleep at the wheel

Nichlas Sayre, a 17-year-old junior, said he noticed the driver's tendency to doze off weeks ago

Worried about his safety, he recorded the video and shared it with his parents and teachers. 

The driver is seen in the bus's rear-view mirror and his eyes appear closed as he slows to a stop at an intersection. Once the bus comes to a full stop, the driver appears to waken and shakes his head, then rubs his forehead.

Toward the end of the 30-second video, his head appears to fall onto the chest strap of his seatbelt.

The principal of Sayre's high school, Peyton Chapman, sent the video to the Portland Public School transportation service.

The transportation service responded by firing the driver, according to The Oregonian. 

It turns out that other students had complained about the same driver before Sayre recorded the video.

The transportation service said it contacted First Student, the agency it uses to bus kids to school, regarding the earlier and were told that the driver would be monitored. 

But it took Sayre's video to put him out of a job. 

The driver's identity has not been revealed. 

Sayre said he intends to keep an eye on his new driver, as well. 

'I'll probably pay attention to this bus driver too,' he said. 'You know, just in case we get two in a row.'
