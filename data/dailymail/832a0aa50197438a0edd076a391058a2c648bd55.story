Bill Clinton has waded into the controversy over the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York, saying that the unarmed black man 'didn't deserve to die'.

The former President said that there is a 'divide that exists between the people and the police' which needs addressing.

Tapping into the racial tensions around Garner's death, he added that people have 'preconceptions wired into us and we have got to get beyond them.'

Bill Clinton has spoken for the first time over Eric Garner's death, saying the father 'didn't deserve to die' for illegally selling cigarettes, adding that people 'have got to get beyond' their preconceptions

Speaking to news site Fusion, Clinton said: '[Garner] was obviously not well, he was overweight and vulnerable therefore had heart and lung problems.

'He was doing something he should not have been doing. That was illegal. He was selling untaxed cigarettes on the street in small volumes, trying to make a little extra money. 

'But he didn't deserve to die because of that.'  

Garner was filmed being put into a chokehold by police in New York while saying 'I can't breathe' before suffering a cardiac arrest

Eric Garner died while being arrested in Staten Island in July. Mobile phone footage of the arrest shows officer Daniel Pantaleo apparently putting Garner in a chokehold while Garner says 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe.'

Garner then went into cardiac arrest and was taken to Richmond University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

Garner's death, and the recent decision by a Grand Jury not to indict officer Pantaleo, have sparked months of protests across the globe.

The issue has sharply divided America, with police forces springing to the defence of their own, while celebrity figures such as Oprah Winfrey have described the events as a 'wake up call'.

Sports stars such as LeBron James and Kobe Bryant also courted controversy when they warmed up wearing sweater which read 'I can't breathe' in support of Garner.

Clinton's support for Garner, the first time he has spoken publicly about the death, follows similar remarks from wife Hillary, widely believed to be lining herself up for a 2016 Presidential nomination.

At the start of this month she said she was glad the Justice Department had launched an investigation into the death of Garner, and praised the federal probe into the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson.

Speaking at the Massachusetts Conference for Women, she said: 'Our hearts are breaking, and we are asking ourselves: "Aren't these our sons, aren't these our brothers?"

'I'm very pleased the Department of Justice will be investigating what happened in Ferguson, what happened in Staten Island.

Clinton's comments follow on from similar remarks made by his wife Hillary at the start of this month, in which she said the nation should ask: 'Aren't these our sons, aren't these our brothers?'

'Those families, those communities, and the country, deserve a full and fair accounting as well as whatever substantive reforms are necessary to ensure equality, justice and respect for every citizen.

'Despite all the progress that we have made together, African-Americans, particularly African-American men, are still more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with a crime, and serve longer prison terms.

'I personally hope these tragedies give us an opportunity to come together to find balance again.'
