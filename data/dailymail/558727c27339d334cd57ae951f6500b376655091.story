A New Jersey family is sick and tired of two unwanted new guests - a pair of coyotes that have made the family's old doghouse their bedroom.

Lioira Sofer and her teenage daughter Maayan, 15, have been kept awake the past three nights by their new visitors' incessant howling and screeching.

And they are now at a loss as to how to rid themselves of the problem after both police and animal control said they could do nothing to help them.

Coyote populations are increasing throughout New Jersey as the creature, once confined to the West, continues to migrate through the Canadian Great Lakes region and towards New England.

Ms Sofer said the coyotes had been using the doghouse since Saturday and could be seen leaving early in the mornings, NBC New York reported.

Her daughter Maayan said: 'One time I even thought it was my mom screaming. It's so loud it's like shrieking noises. It is really scary.'

The animals have adapted to living in close quarters with humans and have learned to navigate tasks associated with built-up areas - such as crossing busy roads and avoiding cars.

Over the past few years they have spread to nearly every corner of the United States - wreaking havoc by preying on domestic pets and even attacking children.

But the suburban sprawl and increase in out-of-town developments have prompted some to migrate to more urban areas.
