England’s Golden Generation could get another chance to win the World Cup, but they will have to do it in the blistering heat of Qatar in 2016.

As a test run for the real thing six years later, Qatar is set to be chosen to host the inaugural Veterans World Cup in two years time and many of the players who played for England in 2002, 2006 and 2010 would be selectable as over-35s.

Organisers of the 16-team tournament, World Sport Company, have yet to confirm Qatar as the venue but managing director Jawid Bunyadi told the Aspire Global Summit in Doha this week that the Middle East was the chosen location and Qatar appears to be the favourite within that zone.

It will be an early test of the air conditioning in a country where soaring temperatures have created concerns over the 2022 World Cup. The age limit on the 300 players expected to compete in the 2016 event would be 50 and the games are likely to last 35 minutes each half of a 10-minute break.

The tournament will be played at the end of the European season and if it passes without incident it could end all doubts over the safety of the World Cup for real due to take place six years later.

Over 300 football legends will be invited to play in the World Cup and Spain, England, Argentina and Brazil are all expected to take part.

The ban on over-50s might rule out reunion between Terry Butcher and Diego Maradona but Diego Simeone could come face-to-face with David Beckham and David Seaman might have to face his 2002 nemesis Ronaldinho.

Sol Campbell, Gary Neville and his brother, Phil, would also be eligible to represent England.

Qatar are desperate to allay fears that they cannot host a big football occasion and have already won the right to host the Italian SuperCup this December.

The 2016 Veterans World Cup would will also revert to a simpler format with 16 teams in four groups of four, in stark contrast to Michel Platini’s 24-team extravaganza to be played the same summer.
