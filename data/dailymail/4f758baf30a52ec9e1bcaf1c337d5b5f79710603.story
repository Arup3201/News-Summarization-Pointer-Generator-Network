Fat-burning diet pills which have caused 60 deaths worldwide should be banned in the UK, victims’ families have urged.

Campaigners have called for DNP pills to be classified as a class-C drug so possession of the pills would be a crime.

Four British people have been killed from taking the drug, and more than 60 deaths have been attributed to DNP worldwide.

Campaigners have called for DNP diet pills - which have killed 60 people worldwide - to be banned in the UK

DNP - dinitrophenol - is readily available on the internet in £30 or £50 batches.

It causes the body’s metabolism to speed up, burning fat while causing drastic overheating. Warnings online such as ‘the excessive and improper use of DNP can lead to death!’ often do not deter dieters.

On one site, a user said: ‘DNP is pure hell. Body temp can spike as high as 105-108 degrees… any higher and your brain will fry and you’d better be prepared to make funeral arrangements.’

DNP user Chris Mapletoft, 18, died in June 2013 just one day after taking his last A-level exam. His mother, Lesley, believes that if the drug had been criminalised her son would have been put off.

She told The Guardian: ‘Chris was not a wayward child. I’m sure he would not have taken it if he knew it was an illegal drug. He was very against drugs. He didn’t smoke, didn’t really drink.’

Mrs Mapletoft said although her son was sporty, he was not a body builder and she believes he took DNP in order to look ‘perfect’ for a holiday to Ayia Napa with his peers.

Police told her that if they tracked down the owner of the website who sold the pills to her son they may be able to caution them.

She added: ‘And you just think, sorry, our son has died and other people have died – caution? That’s something you get if you nick a bar of chocolate, isn’t it?’

Other British victims include Sean Cleathero, a 28-year-old father who died last March; Sarmad Alladin, an 18-year-old bodybuilder who died in February; and Sarah Houston, a medicine student who died in September 2012.

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority is powerless to ban use of DNP as a drug because it is not a pharmaceutical.

The Food Standards Agency can step in if DNP is sold for human consumption, but as the horsemeat scandal showed, enforcement against overseas suppliers is problematic.

Cheryl Gillan, MP for Chesham and Amersham, met with families and representatives of the police and regulatory authorities about the best course of action.

She said: ‘I’m looking at whether it will be helpful to have DNP brought under the Misuse of Drugs Act [as a class-C]. My aim would be to make sure that this drug is not marketed as a weight-loss drug.’
