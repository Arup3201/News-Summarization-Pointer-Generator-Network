It is supposed to be the programme that showcases the best of British talent.

But switch on Britain's Got Talent tonight and you might be puzzled by what you see. For six of the acts through to this year's semi-final are foreign.

And following criticism of the lack of home-grown talent, one of the contestants has admitted he understands the outcry.

Tonight will see nine semi-finalists – three of them foreign acts – compete in the first of five live semi-finals, ahead of the winner being announced in two weeks' time.

Canadian magician Darcy Oake, whose act involves producing two white doves as though from thin air, says he understands viewers' frustration about foreign acts in BGT

Among them is Canadian magician Darcy Oake, whose act involves producing two white doves as though from thin air.

All four of the Britain's Got Talent judges – Simon Cowell, 45, Amanda Holden, 43, Alesha Dixon, 35, and David Walliams, 42, – voted him into the semi-final, following an audition that received a standing ovation.

But as he prepares to perform live tonight, the 26-year-old said he could accept the point of view that only Britons should be allowed to compete.

Oake said: 'I totally understand and get that viewpoint. For me, Britain's got talent is literally the biggest talent show in the world.

'All of these talent show originate in the UK. Britain's Got talent is way bigger than America's Got Talent. Canada's Got Talent is non-existent.

'They tried it for one season and it was a failure. I figured this was the place to do it. I feel like a lot of people don't realise the magnitude of the show.'

The magician went on to say he realises there will be people who don't vote for him based on his nationality. And he added: 'There's nothing I can do about that. I came here to hopefully get some exposure, and that's what I aim to do.

'I can't convince anybody otherwise. If people are offended because I'm not British then that's the way it's got to be.'

Fiery: Pyroterra, dancers from the Czech Republic, also progressed through to the final stages

As well as
 Oake, the foreign acts through to this year's semi-finals include three
 dancers from Paris, a variety act from the Czech Republic called 
Pyroterra and Kony Puppets, a puppeteer from Poland.

Light Balance is a variety act from the Ukraine, while singer Christian Spridon is Romanian.

Three
 of the six are in tonight's heat. Should any of the foreign acts do 
well it would not be the first time competitors from overseas have found
 success on the programme.

In 2012 German Dennis Egel reached the semi-finals with a routine that involved singing Nessun Dorma in giant gold wings.

And
 last year a dance duo from Holland won the praise of the judges, 
prompting criticism that the programme was lacking in British talent.

But in the past show boss Simon Cowell has claimed foreign acts help push the British performers to do better.

He said: 'I think it's quite flattering that they fly all that way to enter this show because they see it as the flagship show, but it means our Brits have got to step it up now.'

Tonight's semi-final takes place on ITV at 7.30. Nine acts will perform in front of the judges, before the public vote opens at the end of the programme.

In the results show which follows, the act with the highest number of votes will automatically win one of 10 places in the final on June 7. The judges will then select which acts go through in second and third place.
