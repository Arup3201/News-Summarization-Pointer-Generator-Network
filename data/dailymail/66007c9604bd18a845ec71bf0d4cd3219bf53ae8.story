It is a small town where people haven't locked their doors in years.

But the deaths of five people have shaken the rural community of Laurel, in rural Indiana, to its core.

Police say they have no suspects in the case after the shocking deaths, which were discovered on Sunday.

Officers were first called at around 
1:30pm on Sunday when a four-year-old child was seen wandering alone in the
road.

After speaking to the child, police were led to a house where the body of one man was found inside.

They then discovered the bodies of four other people, two men and two women, inside another home across the street.

Indiana State Police said in a statement: 'At this time there is no person or persons of interest or suspect/suspects.'

'We are continuing to follow numerous tips and leads and we are encouraging the public to continue contacting us with those tips and leads.'

The dead have been named locally as Angie Napier, Roy Napier, their two adult children Melissa Napier and Jacob Napier, and their friend Henry Smith, whose body was found at a separate property nearby.

Autopsies of four of the victims were conducted Monday in Indianapolis and the fifth will take place today. Investigators hope the autopsies will offer clues to the crime.

Neighbour Ryan Renfro told Fox News: 'People who haven't locked their doors in years, they're definitely locking up tight now.

'I actually took off work today because I'm here with my elderly grandparents and I didn't want to leave them here alone until they caught who they are looking for.'

Officers have also interviewed a witness who reported seeing someone drag a body in or out of one of the properties, according to the station.

Family and neighbours speculated that drug activity, which they said had been prevalent in the area, may have been to blame.

Teresa Richardson, who is Angie 
Napier's sister, called the deaths a 'senseless massacre'. But she 
admitted the family had been involved with drugs.

Franklin County Sheriff Ken Murphy said his deputies had been to the address, where four of the bodies were found, previously.

Resident Debra Richardson told Fox 
News said she has complained frequently to police about what she 
believed to be drug dealers at the mobile home.

'I have a greenhouse business, and 
they had more traffic than I do,' she said. 'I'm in here working in the 
greenhouse and I see people pulling in all the time. You don't have that
many people visit you.'

Kerry Wren, a neighbour of the Napiers, said drug use has been a problem in the area for years.

She said the most popular drug was now painkillers, more than meth.

Neighbours said that they had heard gunshots, but had not raised the alarm because hunting season had recently started.

Neighbour Josh Murray said that the small community has been shaken by the shooting.

'I'm still trying to process everything. I'm trying to take in everything that is going on,' he told local station 6 News.

'It seems crazy that something like that would happen in a small town like that,' fellow resident Nikki Switzer told the station.
