Hearing: Jason Dors-Lake, 45, appeared in court accused of punching a former lover who had said his famous parents had abused her

The youngest son of actress Diana Dors has been cleared of punching a girlfriend who he 'fell in love with' after she told him his famous parents were paedophiles who abused her, a court heard today.

Jason Dors-Lake, 45, had a five-month relationship with Chloe Black even though she claimed she had been subjected to sex attacks by 'the English Marilyn Monroe' and her third husband Alan Lake.

Diana Dors died of cancer in May 1984 and five months later Alan Lake died after he shot himself in the head in their son Jason's bedroom.

The abuse claims emerged after Mr Dors-Lake was accused of punching Ms Black  in the head during a drunken late-night row.  

Mr Dors-Lake was arrested last October after they argued in her car on their way home from a birthday party at a Thai restaurant.

But the case was thrown out by a judge because Ms Black changed her story four times, Highbury Corner Magistrates Court heard today.

Describing his police interview, prosecutor Manjit Dogra said: 'He said they were both drunk.

'He stated he and Chloe argued in the car on the way home. He said the argument was about her accusing his parents Diana Dors and Alan Lake of sexually abusing her.

'She had sought him out five months ago and accused his parents of being paedophiles. They then fell in love.

'The suspect does not believe Chloe and states he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and stated she had also accused members of the royal family of abusing her.'

Ms Black was reluctant to discuss the allegations in court, but pressed by Jade Coleman, defending, she admitted she had said his parents were paedophiles.

'It was not the first part of the argument, but it certainly was why he was screaming at the top of his voice about it,' she told the court.

'If he doesn't want any of my so-called dragging his family name through the dirt, I am totally shocked about how he is behaving.

'He is the one screaming and shouting about it,' she added.

She claimed she tussled with a drunk and abusive Dors-Lake when she tried to retrieve her house keys from his jeans pocket.

'He then made a fist with his left hand and he bashed the side of my left cheek bone and temple,' she said.

She told the court she had initially tried to cover for her now ex-boyfriend because she did not want her alleged past experiences to be exposed.

Dors-Lake denied hitting her, but did not have to give evidence after Judge Moffatt decided he had no case to answer after hearing Ms Black had now given four different accounts of the incident.

The judge said she had no reason to believe something did not happen, but could not be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the offence occurred.

On being told he was free to go Dors-Lake thanked the judge and said: 'I would never, ever strike a woman in any way.'

Dors-Lake added: 'Be careful who you fall in love with.'

The actor and musician co-penned a tell-all book about growing up the son of blonde bombshell Dors, revealing details of wild parties at their Berkshire mansion, Orchard Manor.

His mother, who once described herself as 'the only sex symbol Britain has produced since Lady Godiva', became legendary for hosting sex and drug-fuelled orgies.

Dors-Lake insisted outside court: 'I was exposed to a lot of things when I was younger, but never anything between adults and children.'

He said everything he had to tell had already been written in the book, Connecting Dors: The Legacy of Diana Dors, by him and Niema Ash, which was published two years ago.

Dors died of ovarian cancer on 4 May 1984, aged 52, when her son was just 14 years old.

Five months later his father, Alan Lake, walked into Jason's bedroom and killed himself by firing a shotgun into his mouth, aged 43.

Orchard Manor along with the bulk of the house's contents were sold off to pay taxes and solicitors' bills, leaving little for Jason, who went to live with his half-brother Gary Dawson in Los Angeles.

Dors claimed to have stashed a £2million inheritance, which could only be located by cracking a code handed to her son Mark Dawson.

The 'key' was allegedly left with Lake and despite her son's best efforts to locate the money the legacy has never been found.

Dors-Lake, of Notting Hill, west London, was cleared of a single count of assault by beating.

Orgies at 11 and offered drugs aged five: How Diana Dors' son revealed wild parties were the norm in his childhood home

Diana Dors' youngest son Jason used a tell-all book to reveal how he took drugs at the age five and had seen orgies by the age of 11 because of the party lifestyle of his world famous mother.

His mother was one of Britain's most famous women who became a Hollywood legend.

After two failed marriages, Diana had son Jason with the love of her life, actor Alan Lake, who she met in her late thirties.

She already had two sons from her second marriage, who lived with their father Richard Dawson, and had a reputation for being an insatiable party animal.

The couple held orgies and in Jason's book, Connecting Dors: The Legacy of Diana Dors, written with Niema Ash, it describes the sex parties.

It said that participants were offered 'alcohol and erotic stimulants' before each couple 'was led to a special room and 
allocated fifteen minutes, unaware that the room was fitted with two-way
 mirrors'.

Diana Dors later married Alan Lake and the arrival of their son Jason, who she doted on, did not sway her from ending the parties.

The book says: 'Diana was reluctant to renounce the parties, the clubs, the fun. She wanted to keep the good times rolling, especially as she could now share them with Alan'.

As a result, Diana and Alan's mansion, Orchard Manor in Sunningdale, Berkshire, became a regular haunt for wild parties, which Jason saw as a child.

The author Niema Ash told MailOnline previously that aged 11 Jason saw 'sex parties at the house where couples were invited to use the guest bedrooms where a camera was set up inside. A live feed then linked to a giant TV screen in the living room downstairs.'

And his introduction to drugs was even younger.

The book says: 'At the tender age of five, Jason's nursery education was supplemented by an introduction to the joys of recreational drug.

In the book  it says Jason, then aged five, woke and stumbled into a next door room to find his father's friends passing around what looked like 'a giant white jelly bean' that they cracked open to inhale a white smoke.

The youngster insisted on trying the 'candy'. After initial reservations, the party decided to let Jason sniff it 'for fun' as long as he promised not to tell his mother. 

He said as an adult he has no idea what he took but recalls 'laughing until his tummy ached' after inhaling it. 

Despite his unusual upbringing, Jason said he has happy childhood memories of his time at Orchard Manor and he never doubted the love his doting mother and father.

But he went off the rails after the death of both  his parents when he was just 14.

His mother Diana died of ovarian cancer when she was 53 and his heartbroken father Alan shot himself five months later in Jason's bedroom.

He went to live in the U.S. with his half brothers and the party lifestyle he had become accustomed continued. 

He had a daughter when he was 22 and attempted suicide during one drug-induced episode.

Jason's co-author has said his life is back on track. Living in Kent, he has reestablished his relationship with his daughter and attends AA meetings.
