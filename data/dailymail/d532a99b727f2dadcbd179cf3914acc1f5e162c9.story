It seems Sam Burgess has put off surgery on his fractured cheekbone to continue celebrating South Sydney's first NRL premiership win in 43 years.

The Clive Churchill medallist mingled with thousands of Rabbitoh's fans who crammed into and around Redfern Oval on Monday afternoon to celebrate the club's long-awaited grand final win.

The 25-year-old played the majority of Sunday's grand final with a broken cheek after injuring himself in the first tackle against the Canterbury Bulldogs.

It seems Sam Burgess has put off surgery on his fractured cheekbone to continue celebrating South Sydney's first NRL premiership win in 43 years at Redfern Oval on Monday afternoon

His black eye and cheek were clearly visible on Monday as he thanked fans for their support at Redfern Oval.

Burgess, who played his final game for the Rabbitohs before he heads back to the UK to play rugby union for Bath, will  undergo surgery on Tuesday after doctors initially expected to operate soon after the game.

For Souths legend George Piggins, the man who successfully fought to have the club reinstated after its expulsion from the competition in 2000, Sunday's game was the first he had attended since Russell Crowe and Peter Holmes à Court took over in 2006.

While impressed with Burgess's courage, Piggins pointed to John Sattler who played almost the entire 1970 grand final  with a broken jaw.

'I've never had a broken cheek bone,' Piggins told Daily Mail Australia. 'I've had a broken jaw. And I've got to say I've never had anything more painful in my life.

'With a broken jaw, when you come out of it all your teeth are wired up. It smells like a sewer rat. No risk in the wide world (a broken cheek bone) hurts. But I'll go for the cheek bone.'

Piggins, who attended the grand final only because businessman John Singleton, the TAB and car deal Steven Nasteski donated a total of $120,000 to charity, said he would be happy to attend another game sometime.

'I might find myself doing that,' the 69-year-old said. 'If I can go to the football and I can sit where I want to sit and be with who I want to be with.

'I'd be interested to go back to another game but there wouldn't be all the fanfare. There's other things in life.'
