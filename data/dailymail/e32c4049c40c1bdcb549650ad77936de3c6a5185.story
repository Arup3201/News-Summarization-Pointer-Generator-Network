Governor Chis Christie shouted down a heckler yesterday as he defended his administration's handling of the rebuilding of New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy.

Mr Christie, speaking on the second anniversary of the super storm, was criticized over official efforts to provide assistance following the natural disaster. The recovery has been uneven in New York and New Jersey, with many houses, boardwalks and business rebuilt but many people still unable to return to their homes.

One participant at the event, Jim Keady, interrupted Mr Christie's speech several times to criticize the pace of storm aid assistance.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie shouted down a heckler as he defended his administration's handling of aid distribution in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy; he was speaking on the second anniversary of the tragedy

Hurricane Sandy, which struck on October 29, 2012, was blamed for causing at least $65 billion in damage

Mr Christie eventually told him: 'Sit down and shut up.'

U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and federal officials toured a flood-ravaged neighborhood near Raritan Bay, in Union Beach, where many residents are struggling to rebuild. 

Andrea Kassimatis held her 6-month-old daughter as she described living with four other relatives in a 37-foot trailer next to a partially built home.

'It's been a rough and grueling process,' she said. 'You feel like your government has forgotten you.'

Ms Kassimatis has received a $150,000 rebuilding grant from New Jersey but only got a third of what her flood insurance policy was supposed to pay - a common refrain up and down the coast.

She said: 'Don't believe what you have from a flood insurance policy. Because what you're sold is not what you're going to get.'

She voiced her complaints to Mr Castro, New Jersey's two U.S. senators, Robert Menendez and Cory Booker, and to Representative Frank Pallone Jr. They agreed more 'accountability and transparency' was needed in Sandy aid distribution. 

The natural disaster caused catastrophic flooding in New York and cities in New Jersey, including Hoboken and Jersey City, and killed at least 182 people

The storm was spawned when Hurricane Sandy merged with two other weather systems, devastating the coastline including this bar and grill in Sea Bright, New Jersey

At an event in Perth Amboy, state Senate President Steve Sweeney said: 'People still aren't getting the answers they deserve.'

The October 29, 2012, storm, which was spawned when Hurricane Sandy merged with two other weather systems, devastated the coastline and caused catastrophic flooding in New York and cities in New Jersey, including Hoboken and Jersey City. It was blamed for at least 182 deaths and $65 billion in damage.

In New Jersey, the Fair Share Housing Center faulted the pace of aid distribution, saying only $220 million of the $1.1 billion the state has received for its main rebuilding grant program has been given to homeowners.

After dealing with the heckler, Mr Christie later said of the incident: 'It seems like a lot longer than two years. 

He added: 'This has been a long, long two years and a long struggle. Time doesn't move as quickly as we might like it to.'

Mr Christie said his administration will keep working until everyone who needs help gets it.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio joined City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and other elected officials to work with Habitat for Humanity at a storm-damaged home in Brooklyn. The group has helped rebuild 100 homes in New York. 

He also toured a Staten Island neighborhood named Ocean Breeze and recounted the destruction.

The mayor said: 'This borough, this island, in many ways bore the brunt of the storm: 44 lives lost due to Sandy, 23 from Staten Island. 

'A lot of pain, and a lot of memory. We are now safer than we were two years ago, that is a matter of fact. But we have a lot more to do. I can say with assurance, when we gather a year from now, we will be safer than we were in 2014.'

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said his state has supported the repair and rebuilding of nearly 10,000 households, provided $20.8 million in grants to small businesses and facilitated the proposal of approximately 600 projects through the NY Rising Community Reconstruction Program.
