A woman was seriously injured in the early hours of this morning after she jumped from her third-floor flat during a fire.

She was apparently trapped inside the flat in Haggerston, East London when the blaze broke out, forcing the evacuation of the building.

After jumping from the window in a bid to save herself, she fell nearly 50ft to the ground and suffered serious head injuries.

Fire engines and ambulances attended the scene, and paramedics took the woman to be treated in hospital.

The five-bedroom flat where the unidentified woman lives received 25 per cent damage, according to firemen, but was only part of the six-storey building affected.

No one else is believed to have been hurt in the fire, which broke out shortly before 3am.

A spokesman for the London Fire Brigade said: 'We received a call at 2.50 this morning to Adelaide Wharf, Whiston Road.

'One adult female jumped from the third-floor level before we arrived. She was removed by the London Ambulance Service.

'We used two jets, breathing apparatus and thermal imaging cameras.'

The London Ambulance Service said in a statement: 'We sent two crews and a duty officer and treated one patient, a woman.

'She was taken as a priority to the Royal London Hospital with a head injury.

'Her condition is serious.'

Another resident of the building said that she initially thought the fire alarm must be a drill before realising that it was a genuine emergency.
