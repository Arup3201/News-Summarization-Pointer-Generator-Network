It has been suggested that the Roman empire, complete with its powerful armies, ambitious architectural feats and impressive reach, came to an end because of lead poisoning.

But now an international team of scientists studying the lead content of ancient tap water has largely disproved the theory.

The team found that Roman tap water contained 100 times as much lead as water straight from springs nearby, but the lead content was probably not enough to put ancient citizens at risk.

Like a game of Cluedo: Scientists and archaeologists are not convinced that lead piping used to transport water to wealthy Romans' villas (pictured) is to blame for the fall of the Roman Empire but say it contained 100 times as much lead as water straight from springs

Lead poisoning is caused by increased levels of lead in the body, which is toxic to many organs and tissues, including the heart, bones and kidneys.

Symptoms include abdominal pain, confusion, headaches, irritability and can result in seizures, coma and death.

Some historians claim that as lead levels in water drank by powerful and wealthy Romans were high, leaders were incapacitated or killed off, which helped lead to the decline of the Roman empire. However, this latest study largely disproves their theory.

There is ongoing debate as to what happened to the Roman Empire in the 4th and 5th centuries but many include the disintegration of political, military, economic and social institutions combined with invasions at the peripheries of the sprawling empire.

Jerome Nriagu, a geochemist, argued in a 1983 book that 'lead poisoning contributed to the decline of the Roman empire.'

His work centred on the fact that the Romans had few sweeteners besides honey and often made a syrup called defrutum or sapa in lead pots to sweeten wine and food, leading to the creation of lead acetate - as well as drinking water carried in lead pipes and bathing in it in municipal baths.

He calculated the level of lead that wealthy Romans consumed and linked the findings to levels of the metal found in preserved bones.

However, his work proved controversial and has been criticised by leading historians.

Wealthy and powerful Romans drank water from lead cups and jugs, carried to their villas by a complex system of lead pipes, which some historians argue weakened the Roman elite and in turn contributed to the demise of the empire which they ruled.

The study says:‘It is now universally accepted that utilisation of lead for domestic purposes and water distribution presents a major health hazard. The ancient Roman world was unaware of these risks.

‘How far the gigantic network of lead pipes used in ancient Rome compromised public health in the city is unknown.’

In a bid to find out, the scientists and archaeologists from the CNRS UMR research centre in Lyon, France, Rice University in Houston and the University of Southampton, took samples of sediment from the harbour basin at Portus, which was an industrious port in imperial Rome, as well as from a channel of the River Tiber.

They 
compared the lead isotopes in the samples with those extracted from 
Roman lead pipes to make a historical record of water in Rome.

The team discovered that Roman water probably contained around 100 times as much lead as spring water.

However, while the levels are high, the 
experts said that the lead content in water was unlikely to be high 
enough to be harmful to humans and all but ruled out the role of lead poisoning 
as a reason for the demise of the powerful empire, Science Mag reported.

Wealthy and powerful Romans drank water from lead cups and jugs, carried to their villas by a complex system of lead pipes, some of which lined aqueducts (like this one on major Roman Road, the Appian way) which some historians argue weakened the Roman elite and in turn contributed to the demise of the empire

Pipes were only one source of lead contamination at the time as lead was used to make cooking pots, to store food and some wine, as well as for jewellery and make-up, which could cause some historians to argue that their theory of lead weakening the Roman elite still has credence.  

The argument that the Roman civilisation collapsed as a result of poisoning was first made around 30 years ago by geochemist Jerome Nriagu and has even been used by a handful of scientists to try and persuade governments to ban lead from gasoline.

‘Although today lead is no longer seen as the prime culprit of Rome’s demise, its status in the system of water distribution by lead pipes (fistulæ) still stands as a major public health issue,’ the scientists wrote.

In their study, published in journal PNAS, the experts charted lead content at major events in Rome’s history, such as  the Gothic Wars in 535AD, Byzantine repairs to Roman aqueducts and the ninth century Arab sack of Rome.

‘The Pb [lead] isotope record shows that the discontinuities in the pollution of the Tiber by lead are intimately entwined with the major issues affecting Late Antique Rome and its water distribution system,’ it says.

The scientists think their research will help historians who are tracking the changing character of Italy’s capital.
