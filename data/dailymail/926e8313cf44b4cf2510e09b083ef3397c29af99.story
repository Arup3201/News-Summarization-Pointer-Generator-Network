Bad news, Instagramers: The selfie is officially played out thanks to an entrepreneur in San Francisco who has just raised the bar for ego-inflating, self-photography.

Behold: The 'dronie' is upon us.

Amit Gupta, the founder of the photography accessory store Photojojo, has been experimenting with taking the ultimate aerial self-portraits for months - and it appears he's successfully snapped the first 'dronie.'

Selfie: The queen of selfies, Kim Kardashian, has become somewhat infamous for her shameless use of selfies she shares on social media

Gupta and New York Times technology business columnist Nick Bilton last week took a DJI Phantom drone with a remote controlled camera attached to it to Bernal Heights Hill in San Francisco to attempt the first documented 'dronie.'

Apparently, it is tougher than it looks.

'The first thing I learned during my flight lesson is that Mr. Gupta has a
 lot more patience than I do,' Bilton wrote in his Times column on Wednesday. 'Instead of starting the drone and just 
taking off immediately, we started it, set it on the ground, and waited.

'The
 trick with the drones that have GPS built-in is to ensure that it has 
activated before flying — in the case of the DJI Phantom drones, a 
series of lights under the propellers flash green when it is ready to 
go. Once this is done, the drone knows where you are, where it is, and 
if it’s windy, it will stay in place rather than float away. If it gets 
lost, it will now know where it started its trip and return.

'When
 it was finally time to take off I had to tell my inner 12-year-old to 
slow down and not attempt to go as far away as I possibly could.'

According to Bilton, once the drone was ready for flight, it hovered in front of the group for about 10 seconds, at which point Gupta told everyone to smile.

Gupta then 'shot the controls forward and up and zoomed the drone backwards into the sky, shooting it about 800 feet away from us. While this took a few takes to get right, the result, as you can see in the video above, is breathtaking.'
