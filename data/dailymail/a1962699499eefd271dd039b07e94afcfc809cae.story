The wintry Monday night at Stoke is a cliche, but it was a crucial test in Chelsea’s title crusade. With Manchester City level on points, any slip-up would have put Jose Mourinho’s men on the back foot throughout the festive period.

Step up, yet again, John Terry. The Blues captain scored his 60th goal – and 44th header – for the club inside the first two minutes at the Britannia Stadium to set the tone for the game.

The 2-0 win was reminiscent of a turning point in Chelsea’s first title-winning season under Mourinho, a 1-0 triumph at Blackburn in 2005.

Both tricky, spiky midweek matches against teams managed by Mark Hughes, Chelsea gave as good as they got to emerge with three points and a renewed belief that the Premier League title was theirs for the taking.

At the heart of defence for both wins, near-on 10 years apart, was Terry. His manager believes he is now as good as he ever was.

After the match, Mourinho said: ‘When he is on the pitch he is always a threat. But more important for me than the goal is the way he is playing this season, again.

‘When I came here (in the summer of 2013) he was a bit in trouble, his career was a bit up and down and he was not playing regularly for Chelsea.

‘But he has played basically every game, and, for me, at the same level as from 2004-2007 when I was here.’

Terry has changed vastly as a player since then - in fact, it could be said he is even better. Next to Ricardo Carvalho or William Gallas, he was the last-ditch man, throwing his body in the way of shots and attackers alike.

With Gary Cahill now fulfilling that role, Terry is the calmer, far more composed of Chelsea’s centre-half pairing. His impeccable reading of the game means he now steps up and intercepts through-balls, rather than flinging himself at the final shot.

The common perception of his playing style is blood-and-guts, physical steel. Rarely does he get praise for his exceptional technical ability, which is at the heart of his renaissance.

Wonderfully two-footed, his ability to send a 50-yard glided ball to start an attack is topped only by metronome-like short passing to the likes of Nemanja Matic.

With his body on the wane, Terry has used ingenuity in adapting his game to re-establish himself as one of Chelsea's most crucial players.

Once crashing into tackles as befitting his all-action style, the Chelsea captain has picked up just one booking this campaign – in the Champions League against Schalke.

Critics will justifiably point to various off-pitch misdemeanours, although personally calling up a young fan this season in the wake of Jose Mourinho’s barbs at the Stamford Bridge crowd only enhanced his deification among the Chelsea faithful.

It’s a relationship that has been built up over years – from his debut in 1998, through trials and tribulations both on and off the pitch to becoming the embodiment of the crowd on the field.

Still the last player to come through Chelsea's academy and establish himself as a first-team regular, he is a link to the Chelsea of old, the thought behind the attacking delights of Eden Hazard, Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas.

Terry has always responded to his critics in the best possible way. The same weekend the tabloids were plastered with tales of his alleged infidelity, he scored a crucial winner at Burnley.

Consigned to the bench by fleeting Chelsea managers in Andre Villas-Boas and Rafael Benitez, not many could see him as the defence’s main man two years later.

It was him, rather than Frank Lampard, deemed likely to be the first stalwart out of the exit door.

But the way Terry reacted to his old mentor Mourinho’s return has perhaps been his most remarkable feat. A near ever-present since the start of last season, he has laughed in the face of suggestions he was finished at the top level.

The 2005-vintage Terry is worthy of a place in any debate over the best centre half in Premier League history, sitting comfortably alongside the likes of Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell and Tony Adams.

The 2014 re-boot, Terry reinventing his game to lead another Chelsea title charge a decade down the line, surely puts him without peer.
