U.S. stocks closed more than 1 percent lower on Tuesday after disappointing outlooks from Caterpillar and Microsoft raised worries about future profit growth at companies, while an unexpected decline in durable goods orders also weighed on sentiment.

The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 291 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 17,387 on Tuesday. The blue-chip average had dropped as much as 390 points earlier in the day.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 27 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,029. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 90 points, or 1.9 percent, to 4,681.

The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 291 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 17,387 on Tuesday. The blue-chip average had dropped as much as 390 points earlier in the day.

The day's losses were broad, with nine of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors lower on the day, though tech was the biggest drag by far.

The group lost 3.3 percent in its biggest one-day drop since November 2011, in the wake of results from industry bellwether Microsoft. Industrial shares fell, led by Caterpillar.

The two names were the biggest decliners on the Dow, but fellow components Procter & Gable and DuPont Co also tumbled.

Microsoft fell 9.3 percent to $42.66 a day after the main engine of its historic earnings power - selling Windows and Office to big businesses - showed signs of waning.

Heavy machinery marker Caterpillar gave an outlook below expectations, warning that the recent plunge in oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business. Shares dropped 7.2 percent to $79.85.

'There's clearly a lot of froth baked into certain areas of tech, while Caterpillar is giving tangible evidence that things can go down more than they already have,' said Jim O'Donnell, chief investment officer at Forward in San Francisco.

'People may not be aware of the sensitivities that heavy industrial guys have to the oil cycle, or what the ripple effects of oil's weakness will be. There are a lot of companies that are going to be adversely impacted.'

With 24 percent of the S&P 500 having reported, 70.6 percent of companies have topped earnings expectations while 55.5 percent have beaten on revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. 

That compares with the long-term average of 63 percent for earnings and 61 percent for revenue.

Many multinational companies disappointed this quarter, with the stronger dollar a common culprit. P&G was one of the companies pressured by a stronger dollar, sending shares down 3.4 percent to $86.49.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 291.49 points, or 1.65 percent, to 17,387.21, the S&P 500 lost 27.54 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,029.55 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 90.27 points, or 1.89 percent, to 4,681.50.

Adding to the day's weakness, a gauge of U.S. business investment plans unexpectedly fell in December, another sign that slowing global growth and falling crude oil prices were having an impact on the economy.

On the plus side, consumer confidence posted its highest reading since August 2007. That helped indexes recover from their lows of the session; the Dow earlier fell as much as 2.2 percent.

Microsoft fell 9.3 percent to $42.66 a day after the main engine of its historic earnings power - selling Windows and Office to big businesses - showed signs of waning 

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,726 to 1,337, for a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,710 issues fell and 1,029 advanced, for a 1.66-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 49 new lows. 

'U.S. equities could come under pressure as investors ratchet down their growth estimates for the U.S. economy,' said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.

'There was just too much hype about the U.S. economy having risen into a new and higher growth channel. We're still stumbling along.'

Investors were also gearing up for a two-day Federal Reserve meeting that concludes on Wednesday. 

Investors will be looking for the Fed's commentary on how weak earnings and eurozone uncertainty affect the time-frame for raising interest rates.

Investors widely expect the Fed to acknowledge the uncertain global outlook and stick to its promise to be patient on tightening. Yet its timetable remains for higher rates by mid-year, a trajectory that presages further broad-based gains for the dollar.

Markets in Britain, France and Germany all dropped sharply as Greece's new government was on a collision course with creditors over plans to renegotiate its enormous bailout.

The leftist government that came to power in Athens following elections on Sunday looks set on a collision course with the country's creditors. U.S.-traded shares of the National Bank of Greece fell 14.5 percent to $1.32. 

Russia was also in the spotlight after a cut to its credit rating dealt a further blow to the rouble, though by Tuesday the currency had regained some ground against the dollar.

The cost of insuring exposure to Russia's debt rose after Standard & Poor's cut Russia's sovereign credit rating to 'junk' late on Monday, citing weakened economic growth prospects and Western sanctions over Ukraine.

The euro rose for a second day against the dollar. The single currency climbed to $1.1369, up 1.2 percent on the day, moving further away from an 11-year low of $1.1098 hit early on Monday after it became clear that Greece had voted in a new anti-bailout government.
