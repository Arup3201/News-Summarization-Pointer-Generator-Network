Barack Obama is today unveiling a critical plan which his officials say will make it easier for homeowners to refinance their mortgages.

The President is visiting Las Vegas, Nevada, to announce a series of 
actions to help the economy that will not require congressional 
approval.

He seized upon the Occupy Wall Street protests by saying the U.S. is suffering from an economic crisis - and  'people are crying out for action'.

Action: President Obama announced new rules to help homeowners with little or no equity in their home to refinance their mortgages to avoid foreclosures

President Obama added that he is getting impatient for an 'increasingly dysfunctional Congress' to do something and 'where they won't act, I will'.

The fact he is going alone will anger Republicans who are already resisting the $447billion jobs package he has urged Congress to pass.

'It's another day in the campaign life of President Obama,' Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said.

'He's bringing his re-election tour to Nevada, ground zero for the damaging effects of his failed economic policies.'

Mr Obama’s administration is trying to make it easier for borrowers to 
switch to cheaper loans even if they have little to no equity in their 
homes.

They have been working with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which 
intends to loosen the terms of the Home Affordable Refinance Program.

HARP helps borrowers who have been making mortgage payments on time but 
have not been able to refinance as their home values have dropped.

The changes should let banks avoid the risk of a HARP mortgage 
‘buy-back’ if borrowers have made their last six mortgage 
payments.

Borrowers must also prove that they have a job or another source of passive income, reported the Wall Street Journal.

Loan fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will reduce and fees on 
borrowers that refinance into loans with shorter terms will be waived.

The FHFA regulates Fannie and Freddie. Lenders could begin refinancing loans under the retooled program as soon as December.

But loans that exceed the current limit of 125 per cent of the 
property's value won't be able to participate until early next year.

A business owner said the presidential visit will hurt his company's finances.

Nigel Turner, president of Heli USA, a helicopter tour company that flies out of Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon, said his business needs to make $60,000 daily in order to break even. 

But because of the visit flights will be grounded.

He told the Las Vegas Review Journal: 'The biggest thing is making jobs.

'Yet, here is the president coming in to get re-elected and he will devastate one of the main industries in town... We're in Vegas. Vegas is tourism.'

He will discuss the changes in mortgage rules at a stop in Nevada, which
has one of the hardest-hit housing markets in the country.

In Denver, Colorado, on Wednesday, Mr Obama will announce a student loan initiative.

‘The only way we can truly attack our economic challenges is with bold, 
bipartisan action in Congress,’ White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer said.

'The president will continue to pressure Congressional Republicans to 
put country before party and pass the American Jobs Act,’ he told The 
New York Times.

‘But he believes we cannot wait, so he will act where they won't.’

The Nevada trip, where 26 per cent (700,000) of the population is 
Hispanic, comes as Republican candidates have taken a harder line on 
immigration.

Businessman Herman Cain recently suggested electrifying a fence along 
the U.S. border with Mexico to kill illegal immigrants, later calling 
the remark a joke and apologising.

Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann has raised the issue of 'anchor babies,' 
or U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, a term that some people 
find offensive.

Texas Governor Rick Perry has been criticised by opponents for signing a
law allowing some illegal immigrants to get in-state college tuition.

Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney said most of the jobs created under Mr Perry's watch went to illegal immigrants.

And Mr Perry also lashed into Mr Romney during last week's GOP debate in
Las Vegas for hiring a lawn care company that employed illegal 
immigrants.

'The only way we can truly attack our economic challenges is with bold, bipartisan action in Congress'

White House spokesman

Mr Obama won 67 per cent of Hispanic voters in 2008 but many of those 
voters have become disillusioned during the past three years.

Gallup polling shows Mr Obama with a 49 per cent job approval rating
among Hispanics.

This is compared with about 60 per cent at the start of 
2011.
