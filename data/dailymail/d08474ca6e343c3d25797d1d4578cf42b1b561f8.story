A five-year-old with an IQ one point behind Stephen Hawking has turned her genius to painting watercolour landscapes.

Heidi Hankins, who was accepted into Mensa last year with an IQ of 159, picked up a paintbrush just six weeks ago.

But according to her family, from Winchester, the little girl  - who could read and write at just two years old - has barely stopped creating beautiful landscapes ever since.

Heidi Hankins, 5, who has an IQ which almost matches that of world famous physicist Stephen Hawking has turned her talents to creating beatiful watercolour landscapes

Heidi's mini masterpieces include a seagull flying in the sky over a seascape

Proud father Matthew Hankins, a
university lecturer, said: 'Heidi has always been good at drawing and 
that first clued us in to how clever she is.

'Like
most five-year-olds, she was already interested in drawing things like 
pirates and Pokemon, but six weeks ago she asked to use paints.

'She
mixes together six watercolours and will sit there happily chatting to 
you and knock off three landscapes, then go off and paint a treasure 
chest.

'She picks up on 
things very quickly. She likes drawing birds and you can see they have 
real shapes to them - they're not just lines in the sky.

'It
comes from her observation. Heidi has always acted her age in terms of 
her interests, but this is the first thing she has done outside her age 
bracket.'

Heidi's work has already attracted praise from the art community.

Her father, Matthew Hankins, said: 'She picks up on things very quickly. She likes drawing birds and you can see they have real shapes to them - they're not just lines in the sky'

Mr Hankins and Heidi's mother Sophy, an artist, are now considering an exhibition of their daughter's work

Nick Stewart, programme leader of fine art at Winchester School of Art, said 'For a five-year-old these are remarkably mature and confident watercolour paintings.

'The handling of the medium is subtle and the disciplined minimal quality isextraordinary for someone so young.'

Mr Hankins said Heidi, loved school - but like most five-year-olds is still more interested in play than work.

But the little girl has still not lost her sense of fun. Mr Hankins said Heidi, loved school, but like most five-year-olds is still more interested in play than work

He said: 'We were a bit worried because Heidi could read and write at two, which was very early.

'There are some things she finds challenging because she does not like to get things wrong. But if she can finish work quickly it means she can run off and play. She is not trying to grow up too fast at all.'

Heidi's brother Isaac, aged 11, is also accomplished - he is a chorister at Winchester Cathedral.
