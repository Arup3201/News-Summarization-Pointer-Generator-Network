As she snoozes in the living room that should be her sanctuary, a pensioner’s security is violated in the most appalling way.

These CCTV images show hooded burglar Patrick Reid prowling around 68-year-old  Margaret Woodward’s armchair as she sleeps, totally oblivious to the danger in her midst.

But if Reid felt invincible in the face of such vulnerability, he was deluded.

Creepy: Burglar Patrick Reid is pictured approaching Margaret Woodward as she sleeps in an armchair

Thief: Hidden cameras set up by police showed Reid taking Mrs Woodward's handbag from the basket of her mobility scooter

After rifling through her handbag and the basket of her mobility scooter, Reid set off an alarm as he was leaving.

Far
 from cowering in her seat, Mrs Woodward struggled to her feet, grabbed 
her walking stick and chased the intruder out of her flat.

And
 unknown to him, he had been caught on cameras installed by police after
 previous raids on Mrs Woodward’s flat, leading to his capture soon 
afterwards.

The chilling 
footage was released yesterday after the pensioner was awarded £1,500 
for her ‘pluck and courage’ in confronting Reid, 51.

She was nominated by the judge who jailed him for the break-in – the fifth time Reid had allegedly targeted her.

Victim: Mrs Woodward was burgled by Reid five times within a year and had £900 stolen in total

Heading out: Reid casts an eye back at his victim as he prepares to walk out of the door with her handbag

Alarm: The thief started running out of the flat as soon as Mrs Woodward's burglar alarm went off

Mrs
 Woodward, who suffers from severe arthritis in both knees, cannot bring
 herself to watch the film of the April incident because ‘it made me 
feel like I didn’t want to live any more’.

‘It
 was very frightening to wake up knowing there was somebody in my house 
but I was determined not to let him get away,’ she said.

‘I wanted to break his kneecaps with my walking stick so he couldn’t escape.’

The
 retired supermarket worker added: ‘I thought I’d be able to get him but
 he ran into my bedroom, jumped on to the bed and went straight out of 
the window like a gymnast tackling a hobby horse.’

The divorcee, who has no children, called police who found Reid at a nearby retail park.

Officers installed CCTV cameras at her home in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, after the property was repeatedly targeted last year.

She lost £900 over five break-ins before officers identified Reid in footage of the final raid and arrested him.

Running: The habitual thief pictured at the moment the burglar alarm went off

Heading off: Reid turns his back to the camera which had been set up to find his identity

Two
 cameras clearly captured the burglar rooting around the flat for 13 
minutes looking for valuables – at times just inches from the sleeping 
pensioner. Mrs Woodward is first disturbed by the sound of Reid 
unzipping her handbag but is only roused fully from her sleep when he 
triggers the alarm at 12.50am.

As
 she moves towards her walking stick, Reid is seen disappearing into 
another room before making his escape through the bedroom window.

Reid, of Nottingham, was charged with all five break-ins but the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the first three charges.

The
 father of two was jailed in May after pleading guilty to the last two 
break-ins, stealing £53 from the pensioner’s purse in March and £66 when
 he returned to the flat the following month. Police told Mrs Woodward 
that Reid had a history of offending going back years.

She
 said she felt ‘traumatised’ and ‘abused’ by the burglar, adding: ‘My 
privacy has all gone. My main concern from now on is just to keep myself
 alive, just to keep going.’

Judge John Gosling jailed Reid for four years and eight months for his ‘wicked and calculated offending’.

He awarded Mrs Woodward £1,500 of the Derbyshire High Sheriff’s fund, which aims to improve quality of life for local residents.

Detective
 Constable Gill Richardson said: ‘It is particularly shocking in the 
film how brazen Reid is, being just inches away from Margaret.’
