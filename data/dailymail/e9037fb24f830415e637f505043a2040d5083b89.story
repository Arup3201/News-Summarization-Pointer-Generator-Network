They may have been trading pre-budget blows, but Ed Balls and George Osborne could not have looked closer as they appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show yesterday.

The political rivals looked particularly friendly as they outlined their opposing messages, three days ahead of the budget.

And while the shadow chancellor was being interviewed on Radio 5 Live, Mr Osborne was reportedly spotted in the BBC's 'green room' looking after Mr Balls's young son.

It came as shadow chancellor Mr Balls was forced to rule out a cut in VAT during the interview, because he said he is 'daunted' by the size of the deficit

The convivial atmosphere came as shadow chancellor Mr Balls was forced to rule out a cut in VAT during the TV interview with Andrew Marr, because he said he is 'daunted' by the size of the deficit.

Previously, in 2012, he had called for a temporary cut in VAT to boost the economy.  During the show, however, he admitted public finances would not allow for this after the next election.

He was also forced to concede that the 'cost of living crisis' would mean that it would be unlikely that higher earners would have child tax benefits restored under Labour.

Mr Osborne revealed that the controversial Government-backed Help to Buy scheme is to be extended until the end of the decade and the first new garden city for 100 years will be built in an attempt to boost housebuilding.

He said the extension of Help to Buy for new properties - which had been due to end in 2016 - to 2020 will support the construction of 120,000 additional homes.

He told the show: ‘This means more homes, this means more aspiration for families, this means economic security and economic resilience because Britain has got to get building,’

He announced that a new garden city will be built at Ebbsfleet in Kent, to provide 15,000 homes.

‘At Ebbsfleet there is the land available, there is fantastic infrastructure with a high speed line, it’s on the river, it’s in the South East of England where a lot of the housing pressure has been,’ the Chancellor said.

‘You’ve got local communities and MPs who support the idea. We are going to create an urban development corporation. There are already some home being built on the site, but on a much, much smaller scale.

‘It will be a proper garden city. It is not something this country has attempted for decades. That is one of the messages of my Budget.

‘Britain has to up its ambition, Britain has to up its game, Britain has to earn its way in the world.

‘Yes, the economy is recovering but that is not enough. We have got to finish the job.’
