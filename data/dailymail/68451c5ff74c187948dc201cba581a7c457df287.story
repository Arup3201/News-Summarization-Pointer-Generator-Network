Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Amos has joined Championship club Bolton Wanderers on a month-long loan.

Bolton boss Neil Lennon moved for Amos, who is below David de Gea, Victor Valdes and Anders Lindegaard in the pecking order at United, after his Hungarian international 'keeper Adam Bogdan suffered an ankle injury in training on Friday that is expected to keep him out for six weeks.

Amos, 24, played his only first-team match for United as a teenager in the League Cup, and has also had loan spells at Hull City, Peterborough, Oldham and Carlisle United.

He is expected to be on the bench for Bolton's league match against Wolves with Andy Lonergan between the posts but Amos is ineligible for the FA Cup replay against Liverpool as he was not signed before the first tie at Anfield. 

'We thank Manchester United for helping us out after Adam's injury,' said Bolton manager Neil Lennon. 

Bogdan, who has been second choice for much of the season at Bolton, is out of contract at the end of the season.

He has rejected Bolton's offer of new terms and seems set to leave. He was being monitored by several clubs including Liverpool and Crystal Palace.

German clubs Mainz, Stuttgart and Hannover are also interested in Bogdan and could open talks now but his chance to impress live on BBC One in the fourth round replay against Liverpool has been snatched away by a cruel twist. 

Crystal Palace target Chung-Yong Lee will have a scan on his leg on Monday which leaves his £1million transfer in jeopardy with the transfer deadline day closing at 11pm.

Bolton captain Jay Spearing is expected to complete his loan signing to Blackburn on Monday after falling out of favour at The Macron.
