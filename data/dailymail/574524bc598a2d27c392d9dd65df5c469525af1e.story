Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers heaped praise on Philippe Coutinho following his side's 2-1 FA Cup victory against Bolton by insisting the Brazilian playmaker has the potential to follow in the same footsteps as Luis Suarez. 

The Reds staged a grandstand finish against 10-man Bolton, with Coutinho scoring a stunning 20-yarder in stoppage time to  set up a fifth round trip to Crystal Palace.

Coutinho's strike was certainly fit to win the game and was an appropriate way to mark the signing of his new contract, which keeps him at Anfield until 2020.

Suarez - 82 goals in 133 appearances

Rodgers felt compelled to compare the Brazilian to his former striker Suarez.

'You would pay money to watch the kid,' said Rodgers.

'He is a great role model for lots of technical players in this country. He will become world class in the next couple of years.

'Luis Suarez grew and grew in this team and I can see Coutinho falling in the same way, although he might not be as prolific.

'Signing a new deal shows he is really committed to Liverpool and his development.'

Liverpool lost 3-1 at Palace in the Premier League earlier this season and Rodgers said: 'We didn't play anywhere near our level but that was the lowest moment of the season in terms of performance levels.

'We go back there in a different frame of mind and with big confidence.'

Raheem Sterling's 86th-minute strike had levelled Eidur Gudjohnsen's penalty on Wednesday night.

Rodgers applauds the Liverpool fans, and was also full of praise for his side's improvements

Bolton manager Neil Lennon may be the subject of FA disciplinary action after he called referee Roger East's performance 'rubbish'.

But Rodgers was adamant that Liverpool deserved the victory. 'At 1-0 I expected us to win it,' he said. 'The confidence at the moment is ver high. It was never a penalty. Our composure after that was very good. We scored two, could have had many more.

'We have got a great habit at the minute, which is winning games. You can't question the character. They have shown a real strong mentality in my time here. We needed to arrest the momentum which was going the other way after that Palace game.

'We did that by taking seven points out of nine. It is pleasing because you can see the confidence. The players were magnificent. I have to give them huge credit. The quality of goals was outstanding.'

Lennon was furious with match official East, saying: 'I thought he was rubbish. The first booking Neil Danns gets isn't a booking. He doesn't make contact. I thought he spoiled a very good game. I understand the sending off because it is a second yellow card but the first one isn't.'

Liverpool's best chance in the first half came when Raheem Sterling hit the Bolton post with a curling effort
