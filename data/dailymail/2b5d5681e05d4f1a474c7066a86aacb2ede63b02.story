'Fake' autographs: Classical singer Katherine Jenkins (pictured) has called in trading standards

Classical singer Katherine Jenkins has called in trading standards officials to investigate a company for selling allegedly fake signed photos of her.

The 34-year-old mezzo-soprano posted on Twitter yesterday that Autographed Music Photos in Maldon, Essex, was selling the pictures - adding: ‘I did not sign these’.

But the company claimed to MailOnline today that it obtained the four signed images and a Christmas CD from a supplier who bought them at a charity auction in 2012 after they were donated by her management.

Miss Jenkins tweeted yesterday: ‘Want to warn you that Autographed Music Photos is selling “authentic” photos signed by me. I did not sign these and we're reporting to trading standards.’

However the company said it was ‘aggrieved’ that Miss Jenkins had taken to Twitter to report a problem with the pictures before members of her management had got in touch.

A spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We're quite annoyed she tweeted without anybody contacting us first, so that we could do something about this. As soon as we were aware of it, we immediately removed them.

‘We only had three or four photos and a Christmas CD signed by her. I've gone back to the guy who bought them from a charity auction, and [he said] they were donated by her management in 2012.’

It was tonight still unconfirmed where the photographs came from, but Miss Jenkins's management insisted that she 'obviously knows her own signature' and 'did not sign' them.

He added: ‘If anybody contacts us, whoever it is, we're always responsive and immediately take action. We've certainly had no disgruntled customer about it. It's come completely out of the blue.’

Miss Jenkins's memorabilia would usually sell for £20 to £30, the company said, adding that it had not yet been contacted by trading standards - but would keep the items available for inspection.

But Miss Jenkins’s manager, Jonathan Shalit OBE, told MailOnline: ‘We tried to contact the company. Katherine also hardly ever signs her photos “Katherine Jenkins” so you can quite clearly tell someone is forging them.

‘Katherine spends hours and hours of time to sign things herself and that's why she was particularly upset as she doesn't want her fans to be ripped off. She regularly tweets that people can send in anything as she is happy to sign them for free.

‘It was brought to our attention as a fan had purchased one which had a certificate of authentication and had asked Katherine to personalise it. 

'Katherine obviously knows her own signature and realised straight away she did not sign it.

‘We still have this in our possession as proof and when on further investigation we looked at their website they themselves had four or five different forms of Katherine's signature. We also emailed autograph trading standards and they are assisting.'

Autographed Music Photos insists on its website that all signed items are supplied by 'an established music and media industry employee, a person that we've known both personally and professionally for many years'.

The firm - which is is run from a £350,000 four-bedroom detached house - also claims to be a member of the Universal Autograph Collectors' Club, although it is not listed within the Florida-based organisation's official dealer directory.

The Autograph Fair Trade Association confirmed tonight that it was investigating the complaint, but this could take months – and it was normal practise to ask trading standards to get involved.

An AFTAL spokesman said: ‘Katherine's management company contacted us to say that there was a company called Autographed Music Photos selling autographs of her that were not authentic.

‘We had a look at it, and there were probably about half a dozen that Katherine said weren’t her signature. They do have a lot of quite unique stuff. It’s not a company that we’ve heard of before.’

An Essex County Council spokesman said: ‘The ECC’s trading standards team has not received complaints about this company and is not currently pursuing any investigation into this matter.’
