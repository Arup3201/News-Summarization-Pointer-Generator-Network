The world's last uncontacted tribes could be monitored using satellites and online service, researcher have said.

A US team has already used Google Earth images to assess the demographic health of a village of isolated people on the border between Brazil and Peru.

They say mapping sites could hold the key to remotely keeping an eye on the tribes without contacting them.

Lowland South America, including the Amazon Basin, harbors most of the last indigenous societies that have limited contact with the outside world.

Studying these tribes, located deep within Amazonian rainforests, gives scientists a glimpse at what tribal cultures may have been like before the arrival of Europeans.

Researchers at the University of Missouri used satellite images to assess the demographic health of one particular village of isolated people on the border between Brazil and Peru.

Remote surveillance is the only method to safely track uncontacted indigenous societies and may offer information that can improve their chances for long-term survival, the team claim.

They used Google Earth satellite imagery to estimate the area of the fields and the size of the village belonging to the tribe.

The team was also able to ascertain as the living area of the tribeâ€™s temporary housing, and compared their data with similar estimates for 71 other Brazilian indigenous communities have have been monitored in the past.

'We found that the estimated population of the village is no more than 40 people,' Rob Walker, who led the study, said.

The Indians appear be to healthy and could be running from Peru due to a invasion of their lands by loggers.

'A small, isolated village like this one faces an imminent threat of extinction. However, forced contact from the outside world is ill-advised, so a non-invasive means of monitoring the tribe is recommended.

'A remote surveillance program using satellite images taken periodically of this group would help track the movements and demographic health of the population without disrupting their lives.

Surveillance also can help locate isolated villages, track patterns of migration over time, and inform and create boundaries or buffer zones that would allow tribes to stay isolated, Walker said.

'Close to 100 uncontacted groups are thought to currently exist in Amazonia.

'Deforestation, cattle ranching, illegal mining, and outside colonization threaten their existence.

'Most of these tribes are swidden horticulturalists and so their slash-and-burn fields are observable in satellite images.

'But, they do move around, sometimes in response to external threats, and this movement requires constant monitoring if there is to be any hope of preserving their habitat and culture.'
