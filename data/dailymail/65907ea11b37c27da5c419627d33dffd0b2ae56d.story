A father is outraged after going to watch his son's soccer game against a rival high school and seeing his son's mugshot on the t-shirts of the opposing team.

Father Kevin Rittenhouse was shocked to see his son, Alex Rittenhouse's, mugshot not just on the t-shirts of students at Marion High School on September 3 but on adults as well.

Kevin Rittenhouse feels as though Marion High School should be culpable for their student's behaviour and says that what may seem like a joke to some is extremely hurtful and disturbing for his family.

Victim: Alex Rittenhouse's mugshot was on the t-shirts of students from a rival high school and he and his father believe it is sheer bullying taken one step too far

Appalled: Kevin Rittenhouse believes that students wearing a t-shirt with his son's mugshot is wrong and that the school didn't properly handle the situation 

Against dress code: Students at Marion High School were asked to removed the t-shirts with an image of Alex Rittenhouse while on school property or before entering the gate at the soccer game

Kevin Rittenhouse  told reporters that his son got into legal trouble last year after being caught with marijuana. Following the incident, Alex was forced to transfer from Marion High School to Oak Hill High School after becoming victim to vicious cyberbullying. 

I was shocked first, then I thought, ‘How did they get this picture?’ Because I never even seen the picture,' father Kevin Rittenhouse told Fox.

The victim's aunt, Kelly Chastain, is also disappointed with the school's handling of the situation and she believes that relatives should have been notified prior to attending the game.

'They could’ve easily made a phone call and said, "Hey, here’s what’s going on. We don’t condone it, here are the steps we’re taking to resolve it,"' Chastain said. 

 “It’s shocking. It’s appalling,” Chastain added vehemently.

Rittenhouse said that the shirts were rivalry taken one-step too far. 

The bullies: Students at Marion High School (pictured) first bullied Alex Rittenhouse after he got in trouble for marijuana possession and police were able to get more students in trouble after confiscating his phone 

His son was first tormented by his peers after police confiscated his phone and were able to identify other culprits involved in the marijuana incident. Students began teasing him on social media sites and calling him a narc, reports Theindychannel.com.

'Maybe if they (thought they) were being funny, you know, but that’s not the right kind of funny. … They want to brush it off like nothing happened and I think people need to know,' Rittenhouse said.

Patricia Gibson, a spokesperson for Marion High School said that the school was 'disappointed' about the bullying and says that students were told to remove the t-shirts.

'In addition, school administrators took a proactive stance at the time of the games, turning people who were wearing the shirts away at the gate,' Gibson said in a statement.

'No one was allowed into the stadium with one of the shirts visible.'

The school said that students were not allowed to wear t-shirts at the school nor were they allowed to wear it at the game.

'It is a disappointing situation. Administrators have spoken directly with family members to try to resolve their concerns, and would be happy to discuss the situation further if they address their continued concerns directly to us,' said the school in a written statement.

Too far: Students at the school proudly displayed shirts of former Marion student Alex Rittenhouse and posted photos of themselves in their attire on social media
