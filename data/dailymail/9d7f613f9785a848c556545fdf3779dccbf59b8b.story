Police have warned a 'dangerous' game of hoax calls which result in armed units descending on homes, known as 'swatting', is becoming a national epidemic.

Officers investigating one such hoax call which lead to a SWAT team storming a home under the belief a teen had shot dead his mother say it is just one of the latest examples of the 'game'.

An army of police and a SWAT team descended upon the Long Island home on Tuesday, but within minutes they discovered the hostage call was an act of revenge by a disgruntled 'Call of Duty' gamer who'd just been defeated.

Long Beach police commissioner Michael Tangney described the phenomenon, which sees people gain points for the size of police response to a hoax call, as 'very dangerous'.

He told CBS: 'In this... bizarre world of swatting, you get points for the helicopter, for the police cars, for the SWAT team, for the type of entry.

'It’s very sophisticated. Unfortunately, it’s very dangerous.'

Law enforcers say the game of swatting is taking place across the country, CBS reported.

In the city of Tuscon, Arizona, a 15-year-old boy was the apparent target of a mass shooting hoax, according to reports this week.

According to an April 17 search warrant, an e-mail from an anonymous source was sent to the University of Arizona, claiming to be from a teenager, referencing going to the campus with an M4 rifle and body armour.

The teenager told KVOA.com he believed he was the victim of somebody online 'that doesn't like me... for either me coding, or me playing video games.'

Meanwhile, authorities 
believe a man in Independence Township, Oakland County, Michigan, may 
also be a 'swatting victim' after police were called to a home on Thursday
 following a call from someone claiming to be armed with machine gun and
 threatening to hurt hostages.

The
 46-year-old owner of the home told officers who turned up at the house 
that he did not call the emergency services, The Daily Tribune has 
reported.

In April, last 
year MailOnline reported how CNN host Wolf Blitzer fell victim to a 'swatting' prank after Montgomery County police got an urgent message 
saying that someone had been shot at Blitzer's Bethesda home.

'In this... bizarre world of swatting,
 you get points for the helicopter, for the police cars, for the SWAT 
team, for the type of entry. It’s very sophisticated. Unfortunately, it’s very dangerous' 

- Long Beach police commissioner Michael Tangney

Officers
 set up a perimeter and started advancing on the house before a dispatch
 supervisor confirmed the message was a fraud with CNN.

Blitzer was not in Bethesda at the time.

'CNN
 security checked it out with the Montgomery police department....It was
 totally fake,' said a CNN spokeswoman. 'Wolf is fine. That's what 
matters most.'

Blitzer himself was unavailable for comment.

Previous
 'swatting' victims also include celebrities such as Ashton 
Kutcher, Tom Cruise, Selena Gomez, Justin Timberlake, and Russell Brand.

Sending teams to respond 
to fake emergencies can waste tens of thousands of dollars in manpower 
and time that could be going to real problems, The Washington Post reported.

The
 latest incident in New York saw a prank caller tell police over Skype 
that he was 17-year-old Rafael Castillo, and 'I just killed my mother 
and I might shoot more people', The New York Post reported.

However
 Rafael was merely using virtual firearms, his mother Maria was in the 
kitchen making coffee and his brother Jose had just returned home from 
lunch.

'Swatting', which involves making a hoax call to draw a response from law enforcement, usually a SWAT team, is becoming increasingly common. Pictured: A scene from the 2003 film SWAT, starring Samuel L Jackson and Colin Farrell

In the two hour 
standoff, authorities flew helicopters over the house and rushed in more than 60 officers, including elite members of Nassau 
County’s special operations unit.

Police
 in full emergency mode surrounded the home, called for the teen to come
 out and even called him on his cellphone, but he continued to play 
video games.

He had headphones on and apparently couldn't hear his phone or the drama unfolding outside, The Huffington Post reported.

Rafael's brother Jose Castillo, 21, told The New York Post the prank was likely an act of revenge.

'Some guy threatened to swat him,' he said. 'He was p****d that he had lost.'
