The fate of Luis Suarez should become clearer on either August 11 or 12 when his case is to be heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Barcelona have pressed for an express hearing to determine the length of his ban following his bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. It stands at four months.

They will contend and barter that his nine-match international ban with Uruguay should still stand but that the four-month domestic ban from 'any football-related activities' should be reduced.

Getting shirty: But Barcelona fans will not be able to watch Suarez in action until late October as it stands

The 27-year-old's lawyer described FIFA's punishment as 'draconian, totalitarian and fascist' and CAS insiders believe Barca may have some success in their bid to have him playing ahead of schedule in La Liga.

He has yet to be formally presented as a Barcelona player following his £75million move from Liverpool although if the ban remains he would be due to make his debut against Real Madrid on the weekend of October 25.

Meanwhile, Xavi returned to Barcelona training on Thursday without resolving his future.

The 34-year-old was expected to announce his departure to join New York City but he has yet to be fully convinced it is the right step for him.

Offers have been flooding in, but as it stands, he will stay at Barcelona for now. He is uncomfortable with the idea of joining Frank Lampard and David Villa in their stint at Melbourne ahead of New York and is considering seeing how the season pans out before taking up City's offer at a later date.

He still has two years left on contract and would need a pay-off of around £6m to £8m to go now.
