As heir to the Formula 1 empire, Tamara Ecclestone's childhood was no doubt a luxurious one.

And it seems that she wants the same for her daughter Sophia, who celebrated turning one today with a lavish and extravagant birthday party in her honour.

Tamara, 30, and husband Jay Rutland clearly wanted to give their only daughter a first birthday to remember - and they pulled out all the stops by creating 'Sophia's farmyard' in the garden of their London mansion.

Happy birthday, Sophia! Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland celebrated daughter Sophia's first birthday by creating a farmyard for the tiny tot in the garden of their London mansion 

Birthday girl: Tamara uploaded a snap of her firstborn wearing custom-made pyjamas on Instagram with the words: 'Happy birthday angel no words could ever describe how much I love you so proud of the beautiful little lady you are the light of my life'

Zebras, sheep, puppies and ponies were just some of the animals that were seen arriving at the family home, which had been kitted out with pink balloons crafted into 'S' shapes in honour of the youngster.

Each animal had its very own station complete with a gazebo and pink name sign and a balloon artist was also seen making his way into the family home.

On Tuesday morning, Tamara uploaded a snap of her firstborn wearing custom-made pajamas on Instagram.

The picture of the tiny tot wearing the outfit, which was emblazoned with her name and the number '1', was captioned with the words: 'Happy birthday angel no words could ever describe how much I love you so proud of the beautiful little lady you are the light of my life.' 

Fit for a princess: The entrance to the house was transformed into a balloon castle emblazoned with giant 'S' letters in the child's honour

Speaking about the event, Steven Duggan, who didn't organise this event but has organised events for the likes of Elton John and Adele, believes the event could have cost around £70,000. He said: 'This is a beautiful setting for Sophia on her birthday. 

'We have done similar 1st birthday parties for high end clientele like Tamara Ecclestone before where our clients spent upwards of £70,000. It's a first birthday, if you can spoil them why not! It looks magical; a perfect fairytale party!'. 

Formerly of the party-girl persuasion, Tamara is embracing a more quiet life with open arms, confessing that 'parenting is so much better than going out partying'. 

And although Tamara  is clearly loving having a little girl, she does admit that it does come with its less-than-glamorous challenges.

Speaking to new! magazine about the joys of being a parent, she admitted that there are moments that are rather embarrassing. 

'After having a baby, all your dignity goes out of the window!' she joked, adding that some of her most mortifying moments in her first year of having a baby include 'breast leakage' and 'poo on her jeans'.

However, the more disgusting 'perks' of having a young one aside, the 30-year-old is thoroughly enjoying her life as a mother, admitting that she's put her former lifestyle behind her for a more wholesome, honest living.

'The love that you feel is so much deeper,' she said. 'I don't have tolerance for bulls**t now. I don't waste time with fakeness. Sophia's my priority. She's really turned my life upside down – for the better.'

The beautiful brunette socialite also opened up about the fact she and husband Jay Rutland are still sharing a bed with their tot, but that it's not a problem for them.

Speaking in an interview with Hello magazine last year, Tamara - who gave birth to Sophia last March, her first child - revealed that she was a 'hands-on' mother even though she admitted it can be tiring.

'I'm totally exhausted all the time, but I don't care because it's a happy exhaustion,' she explained.

'I'm not drinking or having coffee and I'm being so healthy for Sophia.

'I'm sorry, but I'm completely obsessed with Sophia. I love her so much I'm like a crazy woman.' 

Tamara and her daughter were last week spotted enjoying a day out in Hyde Park, where they were duck spotting.

Their little outing came just before Tamara and husband Jay and their daughter flew out to Milan for another of their many getaways, before also taking a 24-hour round-trip from the city to the glorious Lake Como in the north of Italy. Little Sophia was blissfully unaware of her luxury surrounding as she boarded a private plane with her mother. 

Jay, to whom Tamara has been married since 2013, chose to celebrate his 34th birthday with the quick getaway in the idyllic location, where they enjoyed a night at the Villa D’Este Hotel
