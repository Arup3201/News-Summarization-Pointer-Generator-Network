A carer found guilty of killing an elderly man and blowing $300,000 of his money on pokies barely shed a tear after she learned of his sudden death.

In a police interview taken the night 84-year-old Bill Adamson was murdered with a huge dose of morphine in a Campbelltown motel room in April 2010, gambling addict Kerry Forrest gives a brazen performance.

When asked if she knows how he died, the 54-year-old convicted killer replies: 'In his sleep'.

Brazen: In a police interview, gambling addict Kerry Forrest said she thought Bill Adamson died 'in his sleep'. In actual fact, she killed him with drugs

Fed up: The 'black widow' didn't seem upset about the war veteran's death as she was interviewed by police

The police interview, which was filmed just after midnight on the night of his death, was revealed on Channel Nine's A Current Affair on Wednesday.

Ms Forrest was found guilty in the Supreme Court on May 20 of giving the retired realtor the huge dose of morphine, said to be worth about 10 tablets.

She met and preyed on Adamson after the death of his wife, Beryl. Within six months, he too was dead.

Forgoing her simple role as his carer, she moved in with Mr Adamson and had become increasingly involved in his financial affairs since 2009.

Killed: 84-year-old Bill Adamson was murdered with a huge dose of morphine in a Campbelltown hotel room in April 2010

Evidence: The Campbelltown motel room where the pair were living was found littered with drugs and tissues. Ms Forrest killed Mr Adamson by 'having him ingest MS-Contin', a judge said

She sold his $700,000 Kareela house - leaving them with $300,000 profit - demanded access to his financial records and set up various accounts with his cash.

Mr Adamson was a war veteran but despite his age he was still very active.

In video taken just days before his death he can be seen bounding up some stairs.

Asked how the two became close, Ms Forrest said: 'He would ring me to find out how I was... we struck up a friendship.'

On the night he died, she denied their relationship was anything more than employer and employee and laughed when asked if there was any sexual relationship.

However, police now know they had a joint bank account and plans to build a new home together.

In the week before Mr Adamson's death, the pair were living together in the motel room because the quick sale of his house left them with nowhere to live.

Fatal: The room where Mr Adamson was killed

When probed about what happened in the room, Ms Forrest said they had separate beds and explained: 'We actually lay in bed and watched telly.

'I went up to [Woolworths] and got takeaway, the hot chicken.

'He was snoring, really, really, loud. I've never heard him snore.'

Mr Adamson died a 'slow two-hour death' on his motel bed.

Meanwhile, Ms Forrest went to the dentist after administering the fatal dose.

When she noticed he was 'stone cold' and wasn't breathing she did not call 000, but instead phoned for a doctor.

Hero: The victim was a war veteran who had fought for Australia

'Ms Forrest misappropriated Mr Adamson's money and killed him to prevent that misappropriation being exposed,' Judge Peter Hidden said when giving his guilty verdict.

'She killed him by having him ingest MS-Contin.

'I cannot be certain how she did so, but it is most likely that she crushed tablets and mixed them with his food.'

Ms Forrest pleaded not guilty to the murder and maintained her innocence throughout the seven-week trial.

She will be sentenced in August.
