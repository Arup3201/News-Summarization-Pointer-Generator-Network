This is the shocking moment three armed raiders threatened Domino's Pizza staff with a knife and guns before making off with cash - in a raid which lasted less than 60 seconds.

The men stormed into the takeaway in Corby, Northamptonshire, after pulling up outside the entrance in a red Saab.

CCTV footage shows the masked trio sprinting into the store before diving head first over the counter and rounding up the frightened staff inside.

The gang fled from the takeaway in their getaway car just 55 seconds after they had entered the outlet

One of the men, wearing a red jacket, then grabs a worker around the neck and threatens her with a knife while another rifles through a till in a back room.

The gang - who appear to be holding black handguns - can then be seen running back out of the store and vaulting over the counter before getting back into the waiting Saab.

Northamptonshire Police have released footage of the raid which shows the robbers fleeing in their getaway car just 55 seconds after bursting into the takeaway last Thursday night.

Officers believe the red Saab - which could have been a 9-3 model - was stolen from a property in Barton Seagrave, Northamptonshire, overnight on September 22 and 23.

A police spokesperson said: 'At about 10.55pm, three offenders entered the shop in Rockingham Park and threatened staff with a knife and what appeared to be handguns, forcing them to hand over cash.

'Another person remained outside in a vehicle - a red Saab, possibly a 9-3 model.

'The offenders then left the shop and drove off in the Saab, which had been parked directly outside the premises.' 

Two of the three robbers are wearing dark clothing with hoods pulled up while the third burglar has a bright red hooded top on.

The trio, who are all wearing black gloves, were armed with knives and what appeared to be black handguns during the raid.

Anyone who recognises the offenders or saw the red Saab in the area at the time are asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
