A student journalist claims he was beaten up by a group of activists in Ferguson after they accused him of video recording the meeting.

Chris Schaefer posted a video of himself lying in a bed at Christian Hospital Northeast in St Louis, Missouri, after he was allegedly attacked by members of the activist group Lost Voices. 

The 24-year-old, said he attended a meeting at Greater St. Mark Missionary Church and was targeted because they believed he was trying to live stream the event ahead of the grand jury decision over the cop who shot and killed Michael Brown.

Darren Wilson gunned down the 18-year-old in August, sparking a wave of demonstrations and protests across the city.

Attacked: Student journalist Chris Schaefer ended up in hospital after he claims he was beaten up by protesters at a meeting in Ferguson about the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown

The 24-year-old posted a video of himself lying in a bed at Christian Hospital Northeast in St Louis, Missouri, after he was allegedly attacked by members of the activist group Lost Voices

He described the incident on his website and is now looking for $2,000 in donations to help fund his hospital treatment.

'I was attacked by protesters at a Church because they thought I was live streaming and I wasn't.' he wrote.

'When I first walked in they said live streaming was not allowed. I sat for about 40 minutes listening to the discussion and then people started to move away for the pew I was sitting in. 

'I knew alot of the people their from previous interview and seeing them at the protests and thought many were nice. 

'I had my phone out but it was just in my hand and all of the sudden one person shouted he is livestreaming and pointed at me. 

'Then about five people rushed me and started pushing me to the door, they also ripped the phone from my hands along with the charging cable. 

'Then they threw me against the exit door and I fell outside. I was then hit a couple times in the head and face. I fell to the ground.

'I then almost lost consciousness but looked up at five people who were punching and kicking me. I blocked many punches with my arm and hand and I got kicked severely in the stomach and sides and back. I was also kicked in the legs.'

After that a group shouted 'Stop, stop' and told Schaefer to run. He claims that no one called 911 and even though he stood in the middle of oncoming traffic, no one stopped to help. 

Out of breath and almost unconscious he managed to make it to a Walgreens but collapsed in the entrance.  

Patricia Bynes, one of the movement's most active members, told the St. Louis Dispatch that the group Lost Voices was behind the attack.

'If we're going to hold police accountable for beating us, we need to hold ourselves accountable for incidents like this. I'm not saying all the Lost Voices were involved, but those that weren't need to get their group under control because they have gotten increasingly violent lately,' she said. 

Donations: Schaefer is now trying to raise $2,000 to cover the cost of his hospital treatment on his website

A member of the group blamed for the attack who identified himself as Bud Cuzz said he didn't see anyone get beaten up but reiterated that Schaefer was told: 'no cameras, no pictures and no recording'. 

Renita Lamkin, pastor of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in St. Charles, held a conference on Friday apologizing for the incident, adding that they 'deeply regret' what happened. 

The White House on Friday emphasized its commitment to defusing continued tensions over the Ferguson police shooting.

The White House said President Barack Obama spoke Friday with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and Justice Department officials who stepped in after Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who is white, shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black.

In St. Louis, the department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services met with top commanders from Ferguson, the city of St. Louis, 

St. Louis County and the Missouri Highway Patrol at a two-day session that concluded Friday. It focused on how unintentional bias affects police work.

The voluntary reform effort is separate from a federal civil rights investigation into the Ferguson police shooting and a broader federal inquiry into the department's policing methods.
