Flying just got more expensive for most United Airlines passengers wishing to jet internationally.

Those checking a second back on the airline will have to hand over an additional $100, up from $50 just one year ago.

But United is just one of many taking away the complementary checked baggage. Delta announced in January that it was raising its fees from $75 to $100 as well.

Excess baggage: While the first checked bag is still free, the fees have steadily risen for the second, and doubled in the case of UA

High-flying headache: United Airlines is raising fees for a second checked bag on some international flights $100, citing rising fuel and handling costs

'United’s international customers will continue to be able to check in their first bag free of charge.  This change reflects an increase in costs associated with carrying bags such as fuel and handling' Christen David, a spokesperson for United Airlines, told the Mail Online on Tuesday.

This is the second such price increase in two years, when United raised its fee between the U.S. and Europe $20, from $50 to $70.

Airline analyst Hunter Kaye said that despite the $30 increase, the airline should only expect ‘modest’ profits – around $30million.

He said that it is likely the rest of the major carriers within the U.S. will follow suite and increase prices to match. US Airways and American Airlines charge $70 and $60 for second bags checked on international flights, respectively, according to ABC News.

The additional charges usually fall on leisure travellers, who do not belong to a business or preferred flier program.

Falling in line: Delta Airlines hiked their second bag fee to $100 in January

Across the board: United has increased its fees for Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India, but not for other points of flight

In addition, many passengers are able to circumvent baggage fees by simply modifying their behaviour. 

Those going on shorter trips can eke by with the standard one bag, one personal item as carry-ons, though certain airlines are stingier than others with space requirements and airplane size.

But the alarming rise in baggage fees may have more capitalistic origins.

TIME’s Moneyland writer Josh Sanburn believes that the prices are almost opportunistic, and will bank on the U.S. tourist rush to the Continent as prices make travel more appealing.

'Considering the economic turmoil in Europe, you might think that the airline would consider putting fewer financial obstacles in the way of Americans taking a trans-Atlantic flight to the Old World,' he said.

'Nope. Not even declining jet fuel prices halted the move.'

Mr Sanburn added that many American families will be heading across the Atlantic because the U.S. dollar is relatively strong.

US Airways did not immediately return MailOnline's request for comment on the fare hike.

This year, airline profits are forecasted around $3billion, a wafer thin margin of just 0.5 per cent on projected revenues of $631 billion, according to the International Air Transport Association.

While airlines can make more money from selling extras, it also means more travellers are getting squeezed as they're forced to pay for things that used to come with the ticket such as seat assignments.

U.S. airlines, for example, are setting aside more economy seats requiring an extra fee because they come with more legroom or are closer to the front.

The extra revenue from add-ons such as seat assignments and priority check-in could total $30-$60billion over the next five years, according to IATA.

Passengers took to social media to express their unhappiness. One Twitter user wrote: 'Now United is on my 'Do Not Fly' list, along with Spirit.'

Another said: 'We need a new airline term for "highway robbery."'
