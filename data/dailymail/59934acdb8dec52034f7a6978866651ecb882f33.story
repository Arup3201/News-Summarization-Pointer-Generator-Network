Emotional France coach Philippe Saint-Andre has launched a scathing attack on his own players following Saturday's lackluster 20-13 defeat to Wales in the Six Nations, saying the team has become 'the Father Christmas of international rugby' because it gives away so many points.

His voice trembling with emotion, Saint-Andre looked on the verge of tears Sunday as he made it clear he feels extremely let down.

'International rugby is about combat, humility. But above all it's a collective sport. We don't need starlets,' he said.' In rugby, the team is the star and we need champions. Yesterday, I didn't see any champions, or not many.'

France, which has lost its past four games to Wales in the tournament, lost 18-11 to Ireland and narrowly beat Scotland at home in its opener. Next up is a tricky away match in Italy followed by a full-blooded showdown with England at Twickenham.

Flyhalf Camille Lopez was particularly poor, missing two of his four penalty kicks - and Yoann Huget's first-half try was ruled out because of Lopez's careless forward pass.

'For my part, I don't think I played badly,' a defiant Lopez said. 'I tried different things ... Let's keep on daring.'

His attitude may not have pleased Saint-Andre, who is likely to make sweeping changes for the game against Italy in two weeks' time.

Asked if some players are now playing for their futures, six months ahead of the World Cup, Saint-Andre replied with an emphatic 'yes' - although he stopped short of saying some would never play for France again under his leadership.

'I only want players who are ready to go to the end of the world. If anyone thinks that international rugby is too difficult, then they have my telephone number,' he said. 'They can call me and I'll take someone else. I'll even take a 20-year-old lad who's never played in the Top 14 (French league) before.'

Saint-Andre, one of France's best wingers, took over after the 2011 World Cup, where France lost 8-7 to New Zealand in a tense final. Almost all of that side has gone and Saint-Andre has been rebuilding ever since, although his habit of constantly tinkering with the side has not helped instill continuity.

But he feels the players should take more responsibility and show more pride.

'I've covered and supported them for three years. At some stage you need to know how to win games at the highest level,' he said. 'The French jersey should not only be something you're proud of but also something that enables you to surpass yourself. You need to be a gladiator.

'We've lost four in a row to the Welsh, this has to stop. We have guys who started playing (regularly) three years ago and now have 30 caps. It's time to stop hiding.'

An irate Saint-Andre raised his voice several times during a passionate news conference.

'At some point you have to ask the right questions. We're at our level, that's the truth,' he said. 'It takes the Welsh 30 seconds to score three points and it takes us four minutes. We're the Father Christmas of international rugby and that's what I told the players.'

However, Saint-Andre is no mood to quit.

'I've never abandoned ship, whether as a player, as a captain or as a manager. I've been given a role: to prepare this team for the World Cup,' he said. 'I'll fight every day to do that.'
