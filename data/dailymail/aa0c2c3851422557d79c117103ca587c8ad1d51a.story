Leroy Fer may have been relegated with Norwich last season but his suitors will be impressed by his dancing feet.

The Holland midfielder, a target for Premier League new boys QPR, tied the knot with partner Xenia Schipaanboord at the weekend and showed off in front of friends and family with a first dance with a difference.

The happy couple eschewed the traditional slow dance for a choreographed routine, amazing their guests, although Fer's choice of song was somewhat bizarre as he danced to Chris Brown's hit tune These Hoes Aren't Loyal.

Fer could be on the move in a different sense with QPR ready to offer Karl Henry plus cash to snap up the Norwich man.

The Canaries have already rejected a bid of around £4m for 24-year-old Fer and value him closer to £7m.

Rangers
 boss Harry Redknapp has confirmed an interest in Hamburg's Rafael van 
der Vaart but is keen to bring in a striker after seeing a £5m bid for 
Troy Deeney fall well short of Watford's £10m valuation.
