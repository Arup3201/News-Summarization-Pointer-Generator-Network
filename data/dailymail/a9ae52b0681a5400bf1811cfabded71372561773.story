A Kentucky woman has been jailed for life without parole for killing an expectant mother and ripping her unborn baby 
from her womb.

Kathy
Coy, 34, was handed the sentence after admitting to the brutal murder of Jamie Stice, 21, on the grounds of mental illness in a plea deal which allowed her to avoid the death sentence. 

Ms Stice's son, Isaiah Allen Stice Reynolds, survived the horrific attack although he was born five weeks premature and lives with his father.

Guilty: Kathy Michelle Coy, seen here at an earlier hearing has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering Jamie Stice, 21, in a horrific plot to cut out her unborn baby from her body to claim as her own

Coy, dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit and shackled at the hands and feet, did not speak during the sentencing held today.

She showed no reaction as deputies led her from the courtroom after the hearing.

Warren Circuit Judge John Grise  said the word evil is used even for small disagreements or disputes, and is overused by attorneys and judges. 'Here, however, was evil at work,' Grise said.

Remembered: Stice's baby was five weeks premature

Prosecutors said Coy had befriended 
Stice on Facebook and used a stun gun to subdue the pregnant woman last 
April after luring her out of the house by saying they were going 
baby-supply shopping.

Police said after Coy stunned Stice, 
she slit her wrists, cut the baby from her body and took the baby, a 
uterus, ovaries and a placenta to a local hospital.

The umbilical cord was still attached, police said.

Coy, who has children of her own 
living with other relatives, initially told police she gave birth to the
boy, then said she bought him for $550.

In statements to the court and after 
the sentencing, Stice's family and friends were torn between condemning 
Coy and celebrating a murdered woman they called the 'Little Angel Mom'.

Her cousin, Carolyn Miracle, said Jamie Stice had been 'ready to be a mommy' when she was slain.

Kathleen Smith, the paternal grandmother of Isaiah, looked directly at Coy as she read a statement saying,

'If you knew Jamie, you couldn't help but love her.' Smith then lashed out at Coy, who closed her eyes.

'The death penalty would be too merciful for you,' Smith said.

Miracle said her family was 
devastated by Jamie Stice's death, with her uncle unable speak about it 
and others still haunted by the loss of the expectant mother.

Miracle said her aunt, Jeannie Stice, had 'her heart stomped on' by Coy.

'Kathy Coy decided she would play God
and took our Jamie from us,' Miracle said.

'There's no amount of time 
you can give Kathy Coy that would be enough. There is a higher court that will judge Kathy.

The victim's mutilated body was found off a dirt road in southern Kentucky on April 14, a day after she had been seen leaving her home with Coy.

Police arrested Coy at a local hospital after she had arrived with the infant but showed no signs of having given birth.

Psychologist Eric Drogin testified 
briefly before the plea was entered last month. Mr Drogin said he met with Coy recently and that she suffers from a 
mental illness.

After
killing Stice and stealing the baby boy, Coy drove to the home of a 
friend and said she had given birth to the baby.

The
friend told troopers that Coy was in a car, wearing no pants and 
sitting on the placenta while holding the baby, who had grass on him.

The friend called for an ambulance 
after helping to clean the baby and taking a picture of the newborn.

Police searched Coy's home and 
computer, finding links to two pregnant women on her Facebook page. 
Investigators found one of the women unharmed, but couldn't find Stice.

Police would later find a stun gun and two knives believed to be used in the attack.

'I
then asked Ms Coy if that baby was Jamie Stice's,' Kentucky State 
Police detective Chad Winn had said at an earlier hearing. 'She answered
"I don't know," I was alarmed by this.'

Coy eventually led detectives to a wooded area off a dirt road, where the victim's remains were located.

Jamie Stice's body was found face down on the ground, disemboweled with her hands tied behind her back the next day.

Mr Winn told reporters last month that Coy, who has two children of her own, had faked pregnancies and was obsessed with the thought of having a baby.

In
further testimony heard last spring, the detective said that Coy had asked her 
teenage son to help her commit murder but when he refused she said she 
was just joking.

She had told people she was pregnant and had been hatching a plan for months, it was alleged.

She even stole a sonogram photo to help back her claim.

Mentally ill: The killer was previously married to Shannon Coy, pictured centre. She was already a mother of two when she killed Ms Stice, having a daughter and a son from previous relationships

She even stole a sonogram photo to help back her claim.

‘She was desperate to prove to everybody that she was pregnant, and I
guess nobody believed her,’ said Ms Stice's friend, Ashley Reeder.

‘So I think she did this to show everybody that she was going to have the baby when it really wasn't her baby,’ she told NBC.

Her neighbours in Bowling Green were all taken in by Coy’s baby scam.

‘She has been telling everyone that she was pregnant and we had no reason not to believe otherwise,’ said Darla Mueller.

'The miracle in the whole thing is that the baby made it,' Winn said of Jamie Stice's baby.

Jamie Stice's 29-year-old brother Eric Stice: 'It's
heartbreaking, heartbreaking. We'll just make sure Isaiah 
has the best life we can offer him. We owe that to my sister.'
