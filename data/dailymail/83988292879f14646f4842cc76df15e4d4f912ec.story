Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad is continuing to use chemical weapons on his own civilians, according to the results of tests carried out at the sites of suspected gas attacks.

The claim was made after samples were taken from the ground by trained professionals near the spot where three suspected attacks took place in the war-torn country.

A weapons expert has now analysed the soil samples which have shown traces of chlorine and ammonia - both of which can be used in the production of chemical weapons - at all three sites.

It comes on yet another day of violence in the country in which two car bombs exploded in a pro-government neighbourhood in the central city of Homs - blasts which state officials say killed at least 40 people.

State media claims that mortar strikes that happened just hours earlier in the heart of the capital Damascus killed a further 14, though figures vary

The latest chemical weapons claim was made as the global watchdog overseeing the destruction of Syria’s toxic stockpile prepares to send a fact-finding mission to Syria to investigate allegations by rebels and activists of chlorine gas attacks.

The Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said President Bashar al-Assad's government had agreed to accept the mission and had promised to provide security in areas under its control.

But speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Hamish De Bretton-Gordon, a British chemical weapons expert involved in the recent soil sample testing, said: ‘We have unequivocally proved that the regime has used chlorine and ammonia against its own civilians in the last two to three weeks.

‘In each of the samples we have found evidence of chlorine.

‘Also, the samples indicate that ammonia has also been used in Kafr Zita.’

The samples are said to have been collected from attacks that happened on April 11, 18 and 21 from people who were trained up especially for the task.

Assad and his regime has once again denied claims that it used chemical weapons calling it a ‘baseless allegation’.

But The Telegraph, who asked for the tests to be carried out, reports that some of the toxins came from barrels that were dropped from helicopters in the province of Idlib, where there are reported to have been eight separate chemical attacks on rebel held communities in just two weeks.

The OPCW has yet to say when it will carry out its fact finding mission.

Accusations by rebels and Syrian activist of at least three separate chlorine gas attacks by Assad's forces in the last month have exposed the limits of a deal which Assad agreed last year for the destruction of his chemical arsenal.

The accord followed a sarin gas attack on rebel-held outskirts of Damascus last August in which hundreds of people were killed.

Assad's regime is now being blamed for carrying out chemical attacks in the Idlib province within the last two weeks

Washington and its allies blamed Assad's forces for the attack, but Damascus authorities said rebels carried it out to try to force Western military intervention.

Damascus has now shipped out or destroyed 92 percent of the chemicals it pledged to eliminate. However chlorine, which also has many industrial uses, was never included in the list submitted to the OPCW.

The U.S. State Department said last week that if Syrian authorities used chlorine gas with the intent to kill or harm this would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which it joined as part of last year's agreement.

In addition to the possible chlorine use, diplomats say Western powers believe Syria may have not have declared all of its chemical stockpiles - an accusation which Syria has denied.

Meanwhile, state news agency Sana said the car bomb blast that struck in the predominantly Christian and Alawite neighbourhood of Abbasiyeh in Homs killed at least 40 and wounded another 116.

Homs has been an opposition stronghold since the uprising against Assad erupted in March 2011. Syria’s third largest city has been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in the civil war that followed the initially peaceful revolt.

In Damascus, several mortar shells slammed into the predominantly Shiite neighborhood of Shaghour, killing 14 people and wounding 86, Sana and state TV reported.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, which came a day after president Bashar Assad declared his candidacy for the June 3 presidential elections, a race he is likely to win.

Such attacks are common in Homs and Damascus, and there was no immediate indication that the violence was directly related to Assad's announcement.
