A young patient who died of dehydration at a leading teaching hospital phoned police from his bed because he was so thirsty, an inquest heard yesterday.

Officers arrived at Kane Gorny's bedside, but were told by nurses that he was in a confused state and were sent away.

The keen footballer and runner, 22, died of dehydration a few hours later.

Hospital: Kane Gorny, 22, pictured with his mother Rita, needed drugs to regulate his hormone levels after successfully beating brain cancer. However, during a hospital stay nurses forgot to give him his medication

A coroner had such grave concerns about the case that she referred it to police.

Yesterday an inquest was told how Mr 
Gorny died after blunders and neglect by 'lazy and careless' medical 
staff at St George's Hospital in Tooting, South London.

His mother Rita Cronin, a civil 
servant told Westminster Coroner's Court that staff tutted at her and 
repeatedly refused to listen to her concerns that her son hadn't been 
given vital medication.

At one point he became so desperate 
and upset that staff sedated and restrained him – and on the night 
before his death, his mother said, he was not checked on by medical 
staff, despite being in a room on his own.

Following his death, a nurse allegedly
 inquired whether the family, from Balham, South-West London, was 
'finished' and asked a matron in front of them whether she could 'bag 
him up'.

Mr Gorny, who worked in Waitrose and 
was training to be a locksmith and shoe repairer, had survived a 
malignant brain tumour in 2008.

The cancer affected his pituitary 
gland, which controls the body's mechanisms, such as fluid levels. Part 
of his treatment included a course of steroids to regulate the fluid 
levels in his body. These drugs, however, weakened his bones and he was 
in hospital for a routine hip replacement.

Doctors told him that, without regular medication to control his fluid levels, he would die.

When he arrived at hospital for the 
hip operation, nurses assured the family they would give him his 
medication and said: 'Don't worry, he's in good hands – we'll look after
 him.'

But, despite the repeated reminders 
and insistence by both Mr Gorny and his family, staff failed to give him
 the tablets and he became severely dehydrated after being refused 
water.

In an interview with the Daily Mail in
 2010, Miss Cronin said of the nurses who treated him: 'They were lazy, 
careless and hadn't bothered to check his charts and see his medication 
was essential. He was totally dependent on the nurses to help him and 
they totally betrayed him.'

Yesterday Miss Cronin told the inquest
 she received a distressed phone call from her son on May 27, 2009, in 
which he told her he'd called the police because he was so desperate for
 a drink.

She then went to the hospital where 
she found him 'confused and angry', shouting at staff and behaving in an
 uncharacteristically abusive manner.

Despite this, one doctor asked if he 
was 'coming off the booze' and another asked if he was 'always like 
this'. Miss Cronin said: 'He sounded really, really distressed. He said 
"They won't give me anything to drink". 'He also said "I've called the 
police. You better get here quickly: they're all standing around the bed
 getting their stories straight".'

When Miss Cronin arrived, she 
recalled: 'They weren't doing anything. They seemed out of their depth. 
It felt like the two locum doctors were nervous about calling anyone 
more senior than them.'

The inquest heard Mr Gorny was 
restrained by security guards and sedated with strong medication to calm
 him down. Later, he was put into a side room and left alone.

Miss Cronin said she sat in his room 
for three hours the night before he died without a single nurse checking
 on him or giving him vital medicine.

'He was starting to enjoy his life 
again, even though he had pains in his hip.'

She said she told a nurse who walked 
past the room that Mr Gorny had not had his medication.  When Miss 
Cronin volunteered to return to the hospital should he wake, another 
nurse allegedly told her: 'You don't need to do that. If he makes noise,
 I'll close the door and then he won't wake everyone up.'

She added: 'I later realised that her comment was unbelievable but I was so distraught that it didn't register.'

The morning of her son's death, May 
28, 2009, Miss Cronin arrived at the hospital early to find him 
delirious with swollen lips and a swollen tongue.

She recalled: 'I then heard three 
nurses outside his room and I said: "There's something wrong with my 
son. He doesn't look right."

'The nurse said to me "He had a good night. There's nothing wrong with him and he's just had breakfast and a chat with us."

'I thought: "How could he have had breakfast? There's no evidence (of breakfast)."

'The nurse carried on her handover then I interrupted again and said: “He's not right.”

'The other nurse then tutted and said:
 "She's already told you he had a good night." And with that the three 
of them walked off.'

Miss Cronin said she then noticed that
 her son hadn't been given his medication because the packet was still 
on the table by his bed.

She told the locum doctor about her concerns, but the doctor said it wouldn't do him any harm.

A doctor doing the rounds then checked
 on Mr Gorny. Miss Cronin said: 'He took one look at him then he started
 calling to everyone “Get in there quickly”.

'It suddenly dawned on me he hasn't 
had his medication, hasn't had his bloods done, nobody's given him a 
drink, nobody's bothered to put his drip back on him.

'Nobody's done anything since yesterday afternoon when he became aggressive.'

She said there was a 'flurry of 
activity' and everyone 'had a very sad look on their face' as they 
battled to save her son's life. Miss Cronin said: 'The main doctor came 
out and you could tell he was really angry. He said: “You need to go and
 see your son. He's dying.”

The couple then found their son lying 
in blood and fluid-soaked sheets and a nurse came in and asked them to 
help her to change them. The same nurse later came into the matron's 
office and asked whether they were 'finished', adding: 'Can I bag him 
up?'

The death certificate said Mr Gorny died of a 'water deficit' and 'hypernatraemia' – a medical term for dehydration.

Mr Gorny had radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy following his diagnosis of brain cancer. He was eventually 
given the all-clear and led a normal life until his mother noticed he 
was having trouble with his hip.

As he waited for the surgery, his life started to return to normal.

'He was out and about like everybody else,' said Miss Cronin yesterday.

'I always used to make him take his 
tablets for the next morning, just in case he stayed at a friend's house
 – and he knew the importance of his medication. We all did.

'He was starting to enjoy his life 
again, even though he had pains in his hip. He was upset he was having a
 hip replacement - he was worried he would be in a wheelchair when he 
was 50.'

Nurses at the hospital were said to have been offered counselling as a result of Mr Gorny's death.

The inquest continues. The case is still being considered by the Crown Prosecution Service.
