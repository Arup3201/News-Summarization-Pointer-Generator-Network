At first glance, it appears that Man has stepped onto the surface of the red planet for the first time.

In an image uncannily similar to the one created when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface on July 20, 1969.

However, in reality the martian 'footprint' is simply a bizarrely shaped 'scuff mark' left by Curiosity's tyre tread as the rover trundles over a ledge on the martian surface.

Neil Armstrong maintained for some time later that he said 'One small step for a man', the line he prepared with h rather than 'for man'.

That line was what he, with the help of his wife, had prepared in advance.

The rather fuzzy tapes of the event aren't clear enough to be sure, although the 'a' does appear to be missing.

In more recent years, after listening again to the recording, Armstrong has acknowledged that he may have fluffed his line.

However, more recently still, analysis of the tape indicates that the 'a' may have be present on the recording but is too indistinct to hear.

Looking very similar to the iconic first footprint on the Moon from the Apollo 11 landing, this new raw image from the Curiosity rover on Mars shows one of the first 'scuff' marks from the rover’s wheels on a small sandy ridge.

This image was taken by Curiosity’s right Navcam on Sol 57 (2012-10-03 19:08:27 UTC). Nasa refers to each Martian day as a sol - with staff on the mission working to Martian time.

However, Neil Armstrong's incredible footprint is set to remain on the lunar surface for a long time - Nasa says the first footprints on the Moon will be there for a million years, since there is no wind to blow them away.

Research on the tracks left by Spirit and Curiosity revealed the time scale for track erasure by wind is typically only one Martian year or two Earth years - so the Martian footprint will be long gone by the time a true footprint is left on the Martian surface.

The image was produced as Nasa revealed the rover has been using the Foursquare service to 'check in' from Mars.

Curiosity will continue to check in 
at various locations throughout its Gale Crater landing site, posting 
photos and tips as it rolls along, NASA officials said.

'NASA is using Foursquare as a tool 
to share the rover's new locations while exploring Mars,' David Weaver, 
associate administrator for communications at NASA Headquarters, said in
a statement.

'This will help to involve the public with the mission and give them a sense of the rover's travels through Gale Crater.'

Foursquare users will be able to earn
a Curiosity-themed badge by checking in at museums, laboratories and 
other locations that generate an interest in science, engineering and 
technology, NASA officials said.

The badge will become available later this year.

The $2.5 billion Mars rover Curiosity
landed on Aug. 5 with the aim of determining if the Gale area could 
ever have supported microbial life.

The six-wheeled robot is about two 
months into its planned two-year mission.

While Curiosity is currently cruising toward a site called Glenelg, its main destination is the base of Mount Sharp, which rises 3.4 miles into the Martian sky from Gale's center. Mars-orbiting spacecraft have detected evidence that Mount Sharp's foothills were exposed to liquid water long ago.

NASA has been on Foursquare since 2010, when astronaut Doug Wheelock made the first-ever check-in from the International Space Station.

The Foursquare community numbers more than 25 million users, who have made more than 2.5 billion check-ins since the free app was introduced in March 2009, according to the Foursquare website.
