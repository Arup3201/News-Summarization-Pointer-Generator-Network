As the selection continues for a second jury to re-examine Jodie Arias's sentence, an auction has taken place to raise money for a Phoenix charity by auctioning off her infamous glasses.

Described as a 'one-of-a-kind piece of history', the plain glasses were given a starting price on the auction block of $500.

After almost two weeks, the auction ended with the specs raising $980 for the St. Mary's Food Bank of Phoenix.

The non-profit organization issued the following statement:

'St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance is appreciative of the community support we receive that allows us to serve our mission of feeding the 1 in 5 Arizonans that struggle with hunger every day.'

Arias' attempts to make money off her notoriety are not new; she's been selling art on her website. 

The Maricopa County Sheriffs Office said while they doubt these glasses are even hers they couldn't stop her from selling them because they weren't associated with the actual crime.

Trial: During her trial for the 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend, jurors could not decide on her ultimate sentence

Guilty: Jodi Arias was found guilty of the murder of Travis Alexander in 2008 after stabbing and shooting him

Jury selection resumed Wednesday in her penalty retrial as prosecutors try again for a death sentence.

Arias was convicted of murder last year in the 2008 killing of her ex-boyfriend in Arizona, but jurors couldn't agree on a sentence.

The 34-year-old former waitress was convicted of murder last year in the 2008 killing of her ex-boyfriend, but jurors couldn't reach a decision on her sentence. 

Under Arizona law, prosecutors have the option of putting on a second penalty phase with a new jury in an effort to secure a death sentence.

If the new jury fails to reach a unanimous decision, the death penalty will be removed as an option. The judge would then sentence Arias to spend her entire life behind bars or be eligible for release after 25 years.

Arias admitted killing Travis Alexander at his suburban Phoenix home, but she said it was self-defense. He was stabbed nearly 30 times, had his throat slit and was shot in the head.

Prosecutors argued the killing was premeditated and carried out in a jealous rage when Alexander wanted to end their affair.
