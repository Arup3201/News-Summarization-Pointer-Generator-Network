A classic ‘Bugatti’ left to rot in a rubbish-filled garage for almost a decade is expected to fetch more than £100,000 at auction, despite the fact it's a fake made in the 1980s.

Its eccentric owner, engineer Alan Riley, bought the car in 1987, convinced it was a real grand prix-winning Bugatti Type 51 and worth up to £2million.

Its true value was only discovered after Mr Riley died in 2010 and auctioneers handling his estate found it under a mountain of rubbish at his home in Worcestershire.

Classic: Eccentric engineer Alan Riley bought the Bugatti Type 51 in 1987 believing it was an authentic from the 1930s

Experts at auctioneers Brightwells discovered the 'Bugatti' was a clever fake built in the 1980s by London-based engineer Keith Butti.

It has only two authentic Bugatti components, its fuel tank and the rear cross member.

But the auction house, based in Leominster, Herefordshire, still expects the car to attract global attention when it is sold in September.

And they're estimating the replica will fetch in excess of £100,000 when it goes under the hammer.

If it was an original and authentic Type 51 Bugatti, it would be worth a staggering £2million.

Classic car experts say Mr Riley went to the grave believing his car was the real thing.

It had the same 2.3-litre supercharged, eight-cylinder engine.

But
true enthusiasts could tell the difference and remember encountering 
the car and its owner back in the 1980s and 90s, when Mr Riley would 
take it to shows.

Value: Incredibly, experts still estimate the fake will fetch more than 100,000 when it goes under the hammer in September

David Sewell, an independent Bugatti consultant, said: 'We never had the chance to inspect this car but now we know everything about it.

'Alan never raced the car but he took it to Bugatti meetings all around the UK. He would always say it was an original

'It is not a genuine Type 51 but it has been built to Type 51 specification.

'A real Type 51 is worth around £2million and a replica is worth about 10 per cent of that.

'If you were to build a replica it would cost £150,000 and I’d be very surprised if it didn’t fetch over £100,000

'It needs some TLC but will be great to see it out and on the road again.'

The ‘Bugatti’, which is offered without a reserve, will go under the hammer at Brightwells’ Leominster auction on September 26.
