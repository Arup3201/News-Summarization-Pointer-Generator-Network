The ancient villa belonging to Ben Hur’s arch-nemesis, the real life Roman general Messalla, is set to be buried under concrete, under plans to develop a suburb of Rome.

Officials in Ciampino outside Rome want to build ten apartment blocks for social housing on the site of the consul’s home, despite evidence that the land contains archaeological treasures dating back two thousand years.

Last year archaeologists working in the magnificent villa’s mosaiced baths area found seven seven-foot-tall, complete statues of the Niobids, the children of Niobe and Amphion who were killed by Apollo and Diana— in what would have been an ancient swimming pool.

The villa was discovered close to the Via Appia where other ruins, including the Circus Maxentius are also found 

The characters were the inspiration for the stories, of the poet Ovid of whom Messalla was patron. Ovid was a guest at the villa, according to historians.

Aurelia Lupi, who was working on the dig, said it was ‘the kind of discovery an archaeologist makes once in a lifetime.’

While the discovery of the villa halted the building project, the municipality has asked the regional authority to rescind the construction ban. 

A decision has yet to be made but under current rules construction could be moved just a few feet away from the villa.

The villa has now been placed on the roll call of sites most at risk of being lost to civilisation, the World Monument List.

Archaeologists have  warned ‘the growth of the densely populated city of Ciampino is having an impact on the site of old ruins 

The authors of the list said the site was ‘a jewel’. They warned ‘the growth of the densely populated city of Ciampino is having an impact on the site, as the municipality plans to build new public housing near the archaeological area’.

Lorenzo Parlati, president of environmental group Legambiente in the Lazio region said the site is of ‘priceless value’.

‘It has been recognised at international level as important world heritage at risk. ‘We need definite guarantees for its safety.

‘The mosaics, statues, and the entire area are unique and should be at the centre of tourism drives so as to make use of an important part of our history.’

Roman governor Messalla or Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus was played by Stephen Boyd opposite Charlton Heston’s Ben Hur in the film.

After Julius' Caesar's assassination he led Brutus' army at Battle of Philippi but was forced to surrender and enter the service of Mark Anthony. 

He later served as governor in the East where the film's action takes place.
