Ungoogleable? There is no such thing! File picture shows girl using search engine

Google has forced a Swedish council to drop the phrase 'ungoogleable' from a new dictionary.

The term, meaning 'impossible to find via web search' was in use as the word 'ogooglebar' in Swedish until this week.

The Language Council of Sweden, which oversees the addition of official new words to the Swedish lexicon, had lined up ogooglebar for inclusion in an official list of new words, defined as 'something that cannot be found on the web using a search engine'.

But it reckoned without the might of Google, which demanded that the wording be amended.

It insisted that its trademark should not be diluted by 
being used to apply to all searching of the internet.

Instead, lawyers said the definition should be 'something that cannot be found on the web using Google'. The search giant also wanted its trademark sign added.

The council refused to bow to the demand, and simply dropped 
the word from its list of new additions instead.

In a statement, the council's director Ann Cederberg said: 'Google asked the 
Language Council to amend the definition of the word.

'Today, we instead 
are deleting the word, marking our displeasure with Google's attempts to
control the language.'

The term had become a notable new use or neologism during 2012, the council had said, alongside emoji, emoticons used in instant messages; drinkorexi, an eating disorder involving barely eating while drinking alcohol instead; and conversesjukan, or Converse disease, bad feet or posture caused by wearing trendy trainers.

'Marking our displeasure': Ann Cederberg of the Swedish Language Council said it should not be up to Google to dictate how language evolves

A statement on the Language Council of Sweden's website, asks: 'Who decides language? We do, language users. We decide together which words should be and how they are defined, used and spelled.'

In response, a Google spokesman told the BBC: 'While Google, like many businesses, takes routine steps to protect our trademark, we are pleased that users connect the Google name with great search results.'
