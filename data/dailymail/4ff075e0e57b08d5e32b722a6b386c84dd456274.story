The drummer for country music star Kellie Pickler was in serious condition on Sunday as one of five people hospitalized in two crashes where six others died.

The collisions happened within minutes at the same spot on Interstate 65 in central Kentucky.

Pickler's manager Larry Fitzgerald said 36-year-old Gregg Lohman of Goodlettsville, Tennessee, suffered serious injuries in the wreck on Saturday. He remained in serious condition at University of Louisville Hospital.

Injuries: Gregg Lohman, 36, was hurt during two collisions on the same stretch of road in central Kentucky on Saturday where six others died

Fiery crash: A couple, their elderly friend and three children died after their SUV was hit by tractor-trailer

Kentucky State Police Master Trooper Norm Chaffins said Lohman, who also works as a music instructor at Tennessee State University, had head and neck injuries after a four-vehicle wreck in the southbound lanes.

It happened about 15 minutes after a fiery crash involving a tractor-trailer and an SUV on the northbound side of the highway.

On her Facebook page, Pickler said Lohman wasn't just a drummer, 'he is family'.

'I believe in the miracles and the power of prayer, so it would mean the world to me, my band and Gregg's family if you would please keep him in your prayers,' Pickler wrote. 'Thank y'all so much.'

Six people from rural Wisconsin were killed when a tractor-trailer rear-ended their Ford Expedition at about 11.13am (EST) on Saturday in the northbound lanes near Glendale, Kentucky.

The victims were 62-year-old driver James Gollnow and his wife, 62-year-old Barbara Gollnow; 92-year-old friend Marion Champnise; 18-year-old Sarina Gollnow, relationship unknown; and foster children ten-year-old Gabriel Zumig and eight-year-old Soledad Smith.

Tragedy: The family were returning home from a vacation in Florida when the accident happened

Two other foster children survived and were taken to area hospitals. Police identified them as Hope Hoth, 15, who was transported to a hospital in Lexington with burns and a broken spine; and Aidian Ejnik, 12, who was taken to Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville with cuts to the back of his head.

Barb Gollnow of Shawano, Wisconsin, the sister-in-law of those killed, called the collision 'a horrible tragedy,' but said details about her family's trip that led them through the Bluegrass State would have to come from the surviving children in the family.

State Police said the family was returning to Wisconsin from a vacation in Orlando, Florida.

Chaffins said the tractor-trailer was following too closely to the SUV to stop before the collision. The Expedition was 'totally engulfed in flames. It was totally destroyed by the fire," he said. 'It's just a charred mess'.

Distracted driving is among the causes being investigated.

'That's one of the points we're looking into,' Chaffins said. 'We haven't pinpointed the exact cause.'

Chaffins said despite snow flurries, weather was not a factor in Saturday's crashes. The driver was identified as 47-year-old Ibrahim Fetic of Troy, Michigan. Police were looking at his driving logs and collected a blood sample.

The National Transportation Safety 
Board did not immediately have a comment about whether they were 
investigating. Chaffins expects the board to become involved.

The two crashes shut down the busy stretch of highway for about five hours.

Chaffins said police were investigating whether rubbernecking was the cause of the wrecks in the southbound lanes.

In
that wreck, the Freightliner driven by 58-year-old Mark Bowser from 
Lewisburg, Ohio, struck Lohman's vehicle, then hit a 2005 Saturn SUV 
driven by 53-year-old Victor Martinka of Glenview, Illinois.

Chaffins
said Martinka's vehicle then struck a 2012 Chevrolet SUV driven by 
Stephanie Yates, 55, of Louisville. Chaffins said none of the other 
drivers were hospitalized.

The
wreck on Saturday happened just north of where a tractor-trailer 
crossed the median and struck a van carrying 11 people in 2010. In the 
wake of that crash, the NTSB called for a ban on talking on cellphones 
or texting by long-distance truckers.

The
truck driver is ‘telling us that he saw the vehicle that was in front 
of him and he hit the brakes and he didn't hit them in time,’ Master 
Trooper Norman Chaffins added.

The driver of the tractor-trailer was 
not injured and was co-operating with police, Chaffins said. ‘He's 
obviously pretty torn up about everything.’

The southbound crash involved a 
tractor-trailor and three other vehicles. Police were investigating 
whether rubbernecking was the cause.

‘That's what we're suspecting, that 
people were looking at the crash that happened on the other side and 
became distracted and caused a chain-reaction crash,’ he said.
