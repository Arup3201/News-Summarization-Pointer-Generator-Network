Juventus received bids for Arturo Vidal and Paul Pogba 'from top European clubs' this summer, but turned them down because the players were so important to the club.

Chile midfielder Vidal was a key target for Manchester United, while Pogba was courted by several top clubs including Chelsea and Paris Saint Germain.

But Juve's sporting director Giuseppe Marotta has revealed that the club decided not to let either player go, despite receiving big-money offers from abroad.

'Yes, absolutely, some offers arrived, from abroad, from top European clubs,' he told Processo del Lunedi. 'But we decided not to indulge them.

'We were in a position not to accept and we did with great awareness of the fact that we are talking about two very important components of our squad.'

Marotta would not reveal the size of the bids, but Vidal is thought to be valued at more than £30million, while Pogba could command at least that much if he chose to leave Turin.
