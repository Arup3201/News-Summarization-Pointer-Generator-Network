They say those who are bored of London are bored of life. But the latest craze to sweep the capital proves that even the most obscure - and gruesome - tastes are catered for.

Taxidermy, or stuffing and posing dead animals, has become an unlikely favourite of the capital's trendiest residents.

But you won't find retro stag's heads or large bears in the apartments of Dalston and Hoxton. Instead, taxidermy 2.0 is all about rodents.

Cutesy: Taxidermy 2.0 involves posing mice and other rodents in sugary tableaux

Almost human: Most modern taxidermists also choose to dress their subjects in doll's clothes

Classes which teach you how to gut, clean, stuff and pose a mouse into a variety of ‘cute’ poses such as playing the trumpet, or dancing, have proved a sell-out success, with plans to roll them out across the rest of the UK already afoot.

The brainchild of Muswell Hill resident, Suzette Field, 35, and New York tattoo artist Sue Jeiven, the macabre craft classes are based on traditional taxidermy techniques dating back to the Victorian period.

Though originally envisioned as one-off pop up workshops, their popularity soon saw Suzette enlist the help of Margot Magpie, a member of the UK Guild of Taxidermists, to launch a regular class at alternative venue The Last Tuesday Society.

Speaking to MailOnline, Suzette explained: 'At first I wasn't sure if there would be the demand but our first two classes sold out in just 24 hours.'

The classes takes students through mouse taxidermy, from corpse to cute ornament in just four hours.

Students can choose to pose their mount in a naturalistic setting but are also introduced to the art of anthropomorphism - the attribution of human characteristics to animals, plants or non-living things.

The anthropomorphism trend, which was last popular with the upper classes during the Victorian era, sees the taxidermist pose and often dress the animal in imagined scenes such as in a school room, playing in a band, or having a picnic.

For those who find mice a little tame, extended classes, which cost £200 each, teach students how to tackle more complex animals such as rabbits in day-long courses.

There are also DIY kits available for those who can't get to London, with prices starting at £25.

Suzette adds: 'We had people saying they would come over from France to take the 
classes, even interest from America, and that's what prompted me to make
 it more transferable with the kits.'

Each kit contains everything a budding taxidermist needs, from surgical gloves, long need nosed pliers, galvanised wire to Liquacure Tanning Solution and Borax (a powered mineral).

Though the idea of gutting a mouse in your own living room may sound unappealing, over 500 of the kits have been purchased in just three weeks.

In response to those who question the ethics of taxidermy, Suzette says: 'All the rodents we use were bred as reptile food.

'No animals die specifically for taxidermy and we take great care to only source the rodents from breeders who adhere to strict ethical guidelines.'
