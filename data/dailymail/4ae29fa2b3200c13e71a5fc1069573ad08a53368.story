David Cameron today declared he is a 'marriage man' as he defended plans for same-sex weddings in the wake of a deeply divisive Commons vote.

More than half of Tory MPs - including several senior ministers - last night refused to back the Prime Minister's proposals to allow gay people to marry. With the backing of Labour and the Lib Dems MPs voted in favour of the new law by 400 to 175.

At Prime Minister's Questions today, the Prime Minister defied opposition from 136 Tory MPs to hail the 'great' result which meant 'two gay people who love each other will now be able to get married'.

David Cameron today hailed the 'great' result in last night's vote on gay marriage, despite failing to get a majority of his Tory MPs to back the plans

In last night's free vote, just 127 out of 303 Tory MPs voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and 
Welsh Secretary David Jones voted against, while fellow Conservative 
Cabinet ministers Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, and Attorney 
General Dominic Grieve stayed away.

In the Commons today, Tory MP Christopher Chope, who voted against gay 
marriage, called for heterosexual couples to be given an equal right with 
homosexuals to enter civil partnerships.

But Mr Cameron rebuffed the proposal, telling Mr Chope: 'Frankly, I am a marriage man. I am a great supporter of marriage - I want to promote marriage, defend marriage, encourage marriage.

'The great thing about last night's vote is that two gay people who love each other will now be able to get married, and I think that is an important advance.

'I think we should be promoting marriage, rather than looking at any other way of weakening it.'

Passed: The Commons voted in favour of same-sex weddings by 400 votes to 175, a majority of 225

The PM had launched an eleventh hour appeal to Tory MPs to back the policy, but he failed in his bid to get a majority of his party to support the plan.

Several Tories who rejected the measure 
said they objected to being described as ‘rebels’, since it was a free 
vote. Labour also suffered a split, with 22 of its MPs voting against.

Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott said last night's vote was a victory for equality and demonstrated that while the 'arc of history' may move slowly, it 'bends towards justice'.

Mr Cameron replied: 'I agree very much. I think last night's vote will be seen not just as making sure there is a proper element of equality but also helping us to build a stronger and fairer society.

'I thought many of the speeches made last night were very moving, very emotional and I would pay tribute to all those people who have actually made this case, some of them for very many years, saying they want their love to count the same way that a man and a woman's love for each other counts.

That is what we have opened now in this country and that is why I'm proud it is this Government that has brought it forward.'
