This is the stunning aftermath of the largest landslide ever recorded in North America, which saw 165 million tons of earth dropping more than a half mile at a Utah copper mine last month.

The natural disaster cut mining production in half at the Bingham Canyon Mine after the April 10 incident.

Operators rushed to bring out all workers and equipment from the mine before a massive landslide ripped through the canyon. It started at the mine's northeastern corner and then plummeted to very bottom of the mine, some six-tenths of a mile down.

Miraculously, there were no injuries.

According to Kennecott Copper Corp., the 
London-based company that operates the mine, more than 165 million tons 
of earth had fallen in the landslide.

Production at the mine was cut in half due to the disaster. In a message to customers, Kennecott representatives said that shipments of refined copper would continue as normal through April, but that May deliveries would be down and 'thereafter, we do not anticipate the ability to make further shipments for the foreseeable future'

Production began at the mines again in late April, but only limited operations.

In an effort to reduce costs at the slide-damaged mine, Kennecott has offered 270 workers in their 50s or older a $20,000 early retirement bonus in addition to pension and health insurance benefits. About a third of these workers are planning on taking the retirement, Union officials told the Associated Press May 31. The workers have until Saturday to accept or reject the plan.

The company, which employed 2,100 employees, had been looking to reduce costs with layoffs ever since a massive landslide hit the Bingham Canyon Mine.

According to Jeff Moore, a geological engineer at the University of Utah, this was the largest landslide North America has had to date.

'It's so big it's hard to sense and feel,' Moore told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'We haven't had something of this magnitude since [Montana's] Earthquake Lake'

Moore estimates that around 85 million to 92 million cubic yards of rock and dirt, along with copper, gold, silver and molybdenum were moved. Moore explains this amount of earth as being able to fill 21 Great Pyramids of Giza, or if it were spread out over New York City's Central Park, it would be 65 feet deep.

And it's going to take a lot for the company to clean it up. 150 million tons of waste is almost two-thirds of what the mine moves in a year, according to reporting in the Tribune.
