Researchers at the University of California say their NeuroRacer game rejuvenated the brains of pensioners after only 12 hours

A simple video game devised by scientists dramatically rejuvenated the brains of pensioners after only 12 hours.

The improvements were so great, they did better than those in their 20s at the driving-based challenge, said researchers.

The multi-tasking ability, memory and attention span of the men and women aged 60 to 85 were all boosted by the ‘brain training’ with some of the benefits still obvious six months later.

The scientists said that their technique could be used to keep healthy older adults ‘at the top of their game’ for longer. 

Brain
training is a popular way of trying to keep the mind sharp into old age
but views about its value to everyday life are mixed.

However,
the researchers at the University of California believe their 
NeuroRacer game is different as it was designed to improve 
multi-tasking, a skill known to deteriorate with age. 

Players
use a joystick to navigate a car along a winding road while various 
signs pop up.

Users must push a button when they see one particular sign
while ignoring all the others. 

The game gets more difficult as a player improves but shouldn’t become so difficult that it is too frustrating to enjoy.

Tests showed that a small amount of 
practice led to rapid improvements. After just 12 hours of using it on a
laptop at home over a month, the pensioners fared better than players 
who were decades younger. 

Working memory and attention span also improved, despite the game not aiming to do this, reported the journal Nature. 

Dr Adam Gazzaley, who has patented NeuroRacer, believes it does more to train the brain than other methods like crosswords and card games.

Alexandra Trelle, of Cambridge University’s memory lab, said the results should encourage people to strive to improve their mind sharp and agile throughout life.  

She said that games like NeuroRacer aren’t the only option – with activities such as learning a new language or taking up a musical instrument likely to be more fun and at least as beneficial.  

Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘The ability to improve cognitive health in old age could be crucial in the search for new treatments and preventions for dementia.’
