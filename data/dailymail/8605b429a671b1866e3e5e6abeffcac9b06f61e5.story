With the stripes of a zebra and the tongue of a giraffe, okapis are constantly compared to their more recognisable cousins.

But today at Bristol Zoo, the reclusive okapis commanded the public's attention.

The notoriously shy creatures made a public appearance at the zoo, where the newborn okapi took her first steps outdoors.

Maternal instinct: K'Tusha takes her first steps outdoors with her mother's encouragement

The baby Okapi, named K'tusha, took tentative steps outside the stable doors in her enclosure.

The apprehensive foal was encouraged by her mother, Lodja, who nuzzled her young in an affectionate display.

Bristol Zoo was the first in the UK to care for an okapi in 1961 and the first UK zoo to breed one in 1963.

Since then, 37 foals have been born at the zoo. Okapis are also bred in London and Chester.

The okapi's striking markings are on the back of its legs so its offspring can follow it through dense jungle.

Known as the 'African unicorn' the herbivore has a long blue tongue that strips leaves from branches.

The female okapi has one foal every 
two years. Their pregnancy lasts 15 months and foals typically stay with
 their mother for two or three years.

Bristol Zoo helps to fund the 8,000 square mile Okapi Wildlife Reserve in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The okapi was first discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1901.

After increasingly rarer sightings, 
it vanished from the wildlife radar for decades from 1959, prompting 
fears that it had died out.

But eight years ago researchers working for the WWF found okapi tracks in the wild.

So little was known about the mysterious Okapi until the
early 20th century that the Western World believed it was a mythical
animal and called it the ‘African unicorn’.

The breed was discovered by the British governor of Uganda Sir
Harry Johnston in 1901 in the densest parts of forest in the Congo.

Since then, conservation projects have worked to find out
more about the creature, but it is a relatively new species.

The mammal, which is a cousin of the giraffe, is timid and
reclusive. They have long and strong tongues like giraffes that can reach high
branches and strip them of their leaves.

Their long legs and sturdy body have striped markings that
can either serve as camouflage or as a guide to their calves when deep in the forest.

Okapis are believed to be threatened with extinction in the
near future. Civil war in the Congo has had a devastating impact on the
species. The main threats to okapi come from hunters and the destruction of
their habitat.

Lodja, the mother okapi at Bristol zoo, was born at
Rotterdam zoo in 2001. She was transferred to the UK from a zoo in France.
