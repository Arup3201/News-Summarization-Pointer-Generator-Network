The brother of James Foley said on Thursday that the Obama administration threatened him when he tried to raise funds for the slain journalist's release from the terrorist group that beheaded him.

'They were actually an impedance,' Foley told Fox News, referring to the government's role in rescuing his older brother, a photojournalist who was kidnapped by ISIS militants in Northern Syria in 2012. 'They got in our way... That's what really bothers me to the core.'

The U.S. follows a strict policy of never negotiating with terrorist organizations or paying ransom for Americans kidnapped by them, arguing doing so only leads to more abductions.

James Foley's parents John and Diane Foley and his brother, Michael, speak to reporters about James' murder outside of their home in Rochester, New Hampshire, last month. Michael has become particularly outspoken about the failures of the Obama administration to rescue his brother and for threatening the family for trying to raise funds to secure his release

'We have found that terrorist organizations use hostage taking and ransoms as a critical source of financing for their organization and that paying ransoms only puts other Americans in a position where they're at even greater risk,' White House spokesman John Earnest said.

Foley, however, said the government made it difficult for the family to privately raise funds to secure his brother's freedom.  

'I was specifically threatened by the Department of State about raising funds towards ransom demands for my brother,' he said. 'We were smart enough to look past it but it slowed us down. We lost a lot of time.'

Michael Foley, at right, and other members of his family tried desperately to raise funds to secure James' release from the hands of his captors 

In a separate interview with ABC News, his mother, Diane Foley, said a military officer working for the National Security Council told them several times that her family could face criminal charges if they paid a ransom. 

'We took it as a threat and it was appalling,' she said. 'Three times he intimidated us with that message. We were horrified he would say that. He just told us we would be prosecuted. We knew we had to save our son, we had to try,'

A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied members were told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment, according to ABC. 

Michael Foley also said in the interview the new military campaign the U.S. is pursuing to stop ISIS 'came too late for Jim.'

Strategy: President Barack Obama addresses the nation from the Cross Hall in the White House in Washington on Wednesday and said he had authorized U.S. airstrikes inside Syria for the first time, along with expanded strikes in Iraq, as part of 'a steady, relentless effort' to root out Islamic State extremists

'I just hope it's not too late for others,' he said.

ISIS is still holding several hostages from Western and other countries. 

Diane Foley earlier spoke of her deep disappointment she felt towards the Obama administration for its handling of his time as a prisoner of the terror group, saying, 'I really feel our country let Jim down.'

On the 13th anniversary of 9/11 and the day after President Obama addressed the nation and finally offered a strategy to defeat ISIS, Foley told CNN that 'as an American', she was 'embarrassed and appalled' at the efforts to rescue her son from captivity.

Articulate and thoughtful throughout her interview, she made the startling claim that US officials threatened her family with prosecution if they tried to raise a ransom for Foley, 40, and said 'Jim was sacrificed because of a lack of communication and prioritization.'

And in a thinly veiled attack on Obama's new strategy to 'degrade and destroy' ISIS she said that meeting violence with more violence may not be the answer and said, 'bombing caused Jim's death.' 

'Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,' Foley said. 'As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.'

Still grieving, Diane Foley also said US officials told her they would not exchange prisoners or carry out any military action to try and rescue her son.

At times withering in her assessment of the Obama administration's co-ordination with her family, Mrs. Foley poured scorn on the Pentagon's claim they tried to rescue Foley on July 4, only to raid the wrong base.

Speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Foley said her family knew where James Foley was being held on two separate occasions in Syria, and that each time he was there for months following his capture on Thanksgiving, 2012.

On August 19, ISIS released a gruesome video online which showed the beheading of Foley by a masked ISIS militant, who told the camera in a British accent, that his 'real killer' was the United States.

Exactly two weeks later, another American journalist, Stephen Sotloff, was beheaded, apparently by the same man, who tells the camera, 'I'm back Obama'.

During the efforts to get James home, Mrs. Foley said she met good people, people who wanted to help, but was adamant that she didn't want to single anyone out and lay 'blame'.

Mrs. Foley said it was important to remember that ISIS is the enemy and not the United States. 

However, ultimately, she 'didn't feel that Jim was a priority.'

'We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,' said Foley's mother to CNN. 'And he wasn't, was he?'
