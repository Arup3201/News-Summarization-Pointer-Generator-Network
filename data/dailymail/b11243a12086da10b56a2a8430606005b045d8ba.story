A masseuse at the Ritz-Carlton spa in New Orleans has been arrested after he allegedly pleasured himself and ejaculated on a customer's feet as she lay naked on his table.

The woman says that when she reported the sex attack to managers at the luxury hotel, they informed security but never called the police. 

The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports that Charles Russo, 30, had been disciplined by the hotel before for inappropriate behavior with clients, though the incident was never reported to authorities and he was allowed to continue working at the hotel. 

Charles Russo, 30, is accused of pleasuring himself and ejaculating on a client's feet after she paid him for a massage at the tony Ritz-Carlton spa in New Orleans

Massage prices range from $145 for a 50-minute rubdown to $275 for 80 minutes of specialized 'Royal Four-Hands' massage therapy. 

Rooms at the Ritz-Carlton range from $219 a night to up to $6,000 for the Presidential Suite on the top floor of the hotel in the city's French Quarter.

The victim reported the assault on Jun 1, 2013. Police arrested Russo on Sunday.

It's not clear why New Orleans police detectives took 16 months to act on the case. 

The hotel has refused to comment on whether Russo is still employed or whether he was allowed to continue working while under investigation for the attack.

He faces a charge of sexual battery.

State records show his massage therapist license, which must be renewed and updated every year, is still active.

In arrest records, Russo listed that he works at at different spa now, La Vie De Luxe Salon & Spa in Kenner, Louisiana. The owner of the spa said Russo resigned before his arrest.
