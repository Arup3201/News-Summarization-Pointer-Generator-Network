We haven't even made it through the mulled wine and mince pie-fuelled month of December but personal trainers are already gearing up for January.

If you're planning on upping your fitness regime as part of your New Year's resolutions, one celebrity trainer has just the ticket.

Tracy Anderson, a former dancer and business partner of Gwyneth Paltrow, has launched an online portal where anyone in the world can join in with her intense and world-renowned fitness classes.

Tracy is inviting fitness fans inside her state-of-the-art studios to experience the famous Tracy Anderson Method.

Regardless of where you live, worldwide, you can tune into Tracy's weekly real-time workout videos, working out alongside her classroom clients.

The session, which takes place on Wednesday, will include an introductory video from Tracy and the real in-class experience from that day.

You'll be in good company because Tracy has a string of A-list fans including best friend, Gwyneth Paltrow, as well as Madonna, Shakira, Nicole Ritchie and J-Lo.

In an interview with Glamour, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini said: 'I do the Tracy Anderson method. I've been doing it for a long time now. It's not easy but if you push yourself through, I love it.'

Luckily for Cheryl, she actually enjoys Tracy's work-outs. 'I'm at the point where I enjoy it,' she said. 

Tracy  has produced four exercise DVDs - each of which has sold in excess of 20,000 copies in Britain alone - and a book, Tracy Anderson's 30-Day Method. 

The former dancer and savvy Gwyneth are now business partners. Together they've produced four exercise DVDs - each of which has sold in excess of 20,000 copies in Britain alone - and a book, Tracy Anderson's 30-Day Method.

In a recent piece she wrote for The Telegraph, Gwyneth revealed that working with Tracy has completely changed her body.

She said: 'Still, when I first started working with Tracy, finding motivation was hard. She advised me to think of exercise as an automatic routine, no different from brushing your teeth, to avoid getting distracted. Now it is part of my life.'

According to Tracy all we have to do to get Gwyneth's figure is exercise for two hours every day, six days a week for the rest of our lives. Oh, and eat only according to her strict diet plan. 

Tracy is totally against other forms of cardio, such as running, where you repeat your movements over and over. That, she says, will bulk muscles.

Along with the aerobics you must do a series of 40 toning Pilates-style moves, which change every ten days.

Meal sugesstions include 'power juice' made from kale, spinach, beetroot and apple. Then there is the sweet potato corn pudding (one cooked sweet potato, one raw corn on the cob - blended together till smooth); the carrot parsnip puree (carrots and parsnips - blended); the blueberry and apple sauce (blended until smooth); the gazpacho (also blended until smooth) and protein soup.

Everything is grilled, steamed or poached. No bread, potatoes, pasta or rice are allowed and there are no fats, no dairy, no salt and no red meat.

Working out like a celebrity will set you back £303 ($475) for a six-month subscription.
