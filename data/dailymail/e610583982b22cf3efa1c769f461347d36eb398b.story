James Lee DiMaggio had prescription drugs in his system when he abducted Hannah Anderson after killing her mother and brother

The man who kidnapped teenager Hannah Anderson after killing her mother and younger brother was revealed to have had marijuana and prescription drugs in his system at the time.

James DiMaggio, 40, who was shot dead by FBI following a manhunt through the Idaho wilderness, had drugs in his system, according to toxicology reports on Wednesday.

There were no details of the types of prescription drugs that DiMaggio had taken, according to Coroner Nathan Hess, or how long ago he had ingested marijuana.

Police say DiMaggio, one of Christina Anderson's closest friends, invited her and her two children Hanna, 16, and Ethan, eight, to stay at his house in Boulevard, California, on August 3.

He told them that he was leaving town and moving to Texas.

The burned bodies of Christina Anderson, 44, her son Ethan and the family dog were found by firefighters in the charred remains of DiMaggio’s burned out home on August 4.

Mrs Anderson’s mouth and neck was wrapped tightly with duct tape and her ankles bound with plastic cable. She had been viciously bludgeoned to death.

Investigators were not able to determine Ethan’s cause of death as his body was almost completely consumed by fire. But what little remained suggested extreme suffering and violence.

In relating how it was that DiMaggio 
overpowered her, Hannah has said that he gave her a pill she now 
believes to be Ambien.

She has said she was unconscious from that moment
until waking in Idaho and has no recollection of even being put in his 
car.

DiMaggio was shot six times on August 10 after authorities found him and Hannah at a remote campsite in Idaho a week later. 

Miss Anderson said she did not find
out about the deaths of her mother and Ethan until she was at the 
hospital after being rescued.

Her mother and little brother were killed when DiMaggio's house burst into flames after he rigged it with explosives.

Miss Anderson, 16, spoke at length on the Today Show earlier this month about what she suffered at the 
hands of DiMaggio who zip tied and drugged her during the week-long ordeal. 

Hannah
Anderson said that she had tried to distance herself from the family's 
neighbor after he told her he had a crush on her, which she said 'seemed
really weird'.
