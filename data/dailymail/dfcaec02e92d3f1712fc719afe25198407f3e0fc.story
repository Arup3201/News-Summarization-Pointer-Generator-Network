Inspiration? Police investigating a spate of teenagers throwing eggs at houses in Stoke-on-Trent have blamed singer Justin Bieber for sparking the craze

Police investigating a spate of teenagers throwing eggs at houses have blamed singer Justin Bieber for sparking the craze.

Staffordshire Police have received dozens of complaints about youngsters pelting eggs at homes across Stoke-on-Trent.

It comes just weeks after the 20-year-old heartthrob's LA mansion was raided by police following reports he had 'egged' his neighbours' property.

The Canadian star is still facing possible felony charges of vandalism after allegedly throwing a dozen raw eggs at the home of Suzie and Jeffrey Schwartz on January 15.

Now, police have asked headteachers in the area to remind their students not to emulate Bieber, who is also facing charges of assault in Canada and driving under the influence in Miami.

Today, Police Constable Barry Joyson, of Staffordshire Police, said teenagers in the UK could face the same charges as the singer if they are caught throwing eggs at houses.

'Some of the children have told us this craze has been going around the schools and it was linked to Justin Bieber,' he said.

'We had lots of reported incidents of people finding eggs had been thrown at their houses. It was totally random, no-one was being targeted.

'Quite a lot of residents were getting annoyed because this was happening on a few occasions.'

Police have already spoken to eight youngsters, aged between 10 and 16, who were caught pelting eggs at properties in the area.

They have been forced to signed Acceptable Behaviour Contracts, which state they must stay out of trouble or risk facing further punishment.

Attack: Staffordshire Police have received dozens of complaints about youngsters pelting eggs at homes in the area. It comes just weeks after Bieber allegedly 'egged' his neighbour's property.

During the spate of 'egging' incidents, houses were targeted in the Trent Vale, Penkhull, Hartshill and Joiners Square areas of the city.

Today, victims spoke of their shock that teenagers would wish to emulate Bieber - with one deeming the craze 'juvenile' and 'pathetic'.

Barry Blakemore, 55, whose house was egged, said: 'Why somebody would want to copy Bieber is beyond me. How much of an idiot do you have to be?

'I understand people look up to pop stars but to emulate them by committing mindless acts of vandalism is just absurd.

'I donâ€™t know what the matter is with the youth of today. They want to copy Bieber's criminal acts. The world has gone mad.'

Another victim Sallie Kimberley, added: 'This craze is juvenile and pathetic.'

Bieber, who celebrated his 20th birthday with his family at the beginning of this month, has had several run-ins with his neighbours in the past.

Arrest: Police have asked headteachers to remind their students not to emulate Bieber, who is also facing charges of assault in Canada and driving under the influence in Miami. Above, a mugshot of the wayward singer

He allegedly spat at a fellow resident of his gated community after complaints about his driving.

However, prosecutors later ruled there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges.

He was also embroiled in a number of controversies on his 2013 world tour, during which he lunged at a photographer, had his pet monkey seized at an airport and allegedly spray-painted the wall of a hotel.
