A man was injured during a bizarre incident when a pop-up toilet 'exploded' out of the pavement, raising up a moped several feet into the air before it toppled-off, pinning the shocked victim to the ground. 

According to Dutch media, the injured man was an employee of the company contracted to service the Urilift toilet. 

The toilets are designed to be used at night by clubbers to prevent them from urinating in the streets and then disappear into the ground in the morning, increasing the amount of space available on the pavement. 

The top of the toilet was blown clear of the structure, blasting the moped, pictured, into the air

The following morning, the top of the toilet looks warped with several of the blocks severely chipped

Workers put safety barriers around the defective toilet this morning to prevent anyone else being injured 

Photographs taken immediately after the accident show the roof of the toilet, which also acts as the pavement, was blown clean off, landing several feet away. 

The front wheel of the scooter was badly damaged and the front forks of the bike appear to be severely twisted.  

Sean Davis, who was passing the Paradiso Club in the Weteringschans area of Amsterdam at the time of the incident tweeted: 'Literally just walked past this explosion about 2 minutes before. Feeling lucky.' 

Local TV station ATV5 said some witnesses heard a loud bang and thought there may have been an explosion. 

But police confirmed that the noise was caused by the moped toppling off the top of the toilet.

The Urilift toilets are very common in Amsterdam and have been introduced in several other European cities. 

Local councils have even introduced them in Islington, Watford and Guildford. 

The toilets appear out of the ground at night to facilitate men who require facilities on their way home from the pub or a night club, so they do not have to resort to urinating on the streets. 

Dutch authorities are currently investigating the cause of the malfunction. 

The injured man was taken to hospital in abdominal injuries and the moped suffered extensive damage.  

Normally, an operator presses a button on the remote control to raise the toilet from under ground 

The operators ride around the city on scooters so they can service a number of toilets quickly 

The high tech facilities allow men to urinate inside the metal structure and instead of the side of the street
