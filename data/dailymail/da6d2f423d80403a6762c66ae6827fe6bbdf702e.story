Passengers on a Flybe plane were delayed for more than two hours while they waited for glue to dry on the aircraft's tail wing.

A last-minute repair held up 15 passengers on the Loganair flight from Edinburgh to Stornoway, operated by Flybe.

The plane was delayed for two hours on the Scottish airport's tarmac while a pin-size hole in the plane's de-icing system was patched up.

The hole was found in a piece of tubing on the aircraft's tail wing, which inflates during the flight to break up ice. 

A passenger on the flight, the Reverend Iver Martin, told the Daily Record: 'We were told a hole had developed in part of the tail wing and they were pleased to announce they had put a patch on and were waiting for the glue to dry. 

'Is this acceptable in this day and age? The answer is absolutely not.'

A spokesman for Loganair said that the delay was a necessary precaution, with passenger safety the primary concern.

'During a pre-flight inspection ahead of the 5pm departure of the BE6147 service, a fault was discovered in the aircraft's de-icing system,' he said.

'The pneumatic section of the tail needed an adhesive patch, which required the necessary curing period before the aircraft was cleared for departure at 7:23pm.'

'As a provider of public transport services, passenger safety must always be our primary concern.'
