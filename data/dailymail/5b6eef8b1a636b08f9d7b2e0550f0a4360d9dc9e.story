Scotland's most expensive modern home which boasts sprawling views of Gleneagles has gone on the market for £3.4million despite it costing almost £10million to build.

Kirkton Park, which sits in seven acres near Auchterarder, Perthshire is up for sale after its previous owner, former Rangers FC shareholder Graham Gillespie, went bankrupt, and the property was repossessed.

The six-bedroom luxury home was built in 2007 and boasts a gymnasium, cinema, spa and a two bedroom house.

Kirkton Park, in Auchterarder, Perthshire, which has gone on the market for £3.4million, making it Scotland's most expensive modern-built home 

The property, formerly owned by ex-Rangers FC shareholder Graham Gillespie, is set in seven acres and a man-made lake sits in the middle of the grounds

The sprawling estate in Perthshire has views of Gleneagles, which hosted last year's Ryder Cup, as well as the village of Logiealmond  

There is also a drawing room, dining room, a billiards room, study and domestic offices.

A man-made lake also sits in the grounds and there is also a garage big enough for four cars.

The property is surrounded by a stone wall and boasts views over last year's Ryder Cup venue Gleneagles and the village of Logiealmond.

Chris Hall, a selling agent at Rettie estate agents said: 'The house was built to an exceptional standard and high quality.

The entrance of the property has an open fireplace along with a stone staircase which leads to an open gallery landing 

The house was built for £10million in 2007 and includes a gymnasium, cinema and spa as well as a big open plan kitchen and dining room

Kirkton Park also has a two bedroom house, left, and as well as a spa area, right. There has already been interest in the property from potential buyers 

It was built on the site of a former barn and steading. It's a house of high value in a Scottish context and Gleneagles helps.

'A lot of Scottish wealthy businessmen have homes in the Gleneagles district.

'Its an expensive house in the Scottish context, but if you wanted to build a house of this quality, it is going to cost you an awful lot of money.

Mr Hall added that the house had cost up to £10million to build and there had already been interest from potential buyers.

He explained: 'People who know the cost of building and renovating houses are keen on it.

The six-bedroom house has natural stone walls throughout the property as well as underfloor heating and extensive oak panel flooring 

The swimming pool in the estate's gymnasium and spa. The previous owner, businessman Graham Gillespie, moved out of the property 11 months ago 

'This is due to the money they are saving as opposed to doing it themselves.'

The house was repossessed after former owner Mr Gillespie went bankrupt in 2012 with more than £12million of debt.

At one point he was one of Scotland's richest men until his empire, based on mining and property, collapsed.

Mr Gillespie moved out of the property 11 months ago, and the sale will go towards paying off his debt.
