Brendan Rodgers believes Raheem Sterling will have teams running scared this season as he tipped the England winger to maintain his relentless progress.

The 19-year-old has thrived under Rodgers' guidance and, given his sparkling pre-season form, he has already been installed as one of the favourites to win the PFA Young Player of the Year award next April.

Sterling was one of the few England players to emerge from the World Cup finals with his reputation intact and he will be at the forefront for Rodgers in the forthcoming campaign, charged with the task of keeping Liverpool on the front foot after the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona.

Rodgers said after Liverpool had beaten Borussia Dortmund 4-0 on Sunday that Sterling could 'become anything he wants to be' and he has expanded on the point, claiming he is now playing with such swagger and confidence that teams will be forced to make special plans to deal with him.

'Something we said to Raheem when he first broke into the team and something we've reiterated is that you have to have an identity as a player,' Rodgers explained. 'His identity is he has to score goals and create goals – that's what the job is.

'He scored 10 goals last year and this kid is only going to get better. You look at one of the goals he scored against Manchester City (in New York) – he cushioned it and then the finish – how many times have we seen (Lionel) Messi produce a touch like that? Taking it through bodies and when it's so tight in the box.

'The great thing with watching him now is that he gets you off your seat. When he gets the ball you think 'something could happen here'. There was a moment against Manchester City when he had (Gael) Clichy, (Jesus) Navas and another midfielder coming back to press him and block the space.

'So for teams to have that fear of him as a young shows his development. There is still work for him to do, but he knows that and is a really good boy who is developing really well.'

It hasn't always been this way between Rodgers and Sterling. During the manager' s first summer in charge, there was the need for tough love and again last season, when he had two court appearances to contend with.

The penny, however, has dropped since Sterling was made a fixture in Liverpool' s starting line-up and Rodgers is delighted that he is working with a more mature professional, one who knows what is expected of him.

'When you're so young, it's important to understand exactly what your role is,' said Rodgers. 'It's not just about looking good, you have to be efficient and effective. His development has gone to a new level. He's way above the level from when he first came in.

'Tactically, technically, and what has been beautiful to watch with Raheem has been his maturity and he's turning into a beautiful young man, with all the responsibility.

'Raheem is taking it all in his stride and now he's in a good place with every part of his game. It's just about maintaining that commitment to his work. He's still only 19, but in big games he's performed and he's a wonderful talent.'

Adam Lallana is also on course to return to action at the start of next month after clearing a significant hurdle in his rehabilitation.

The England international suffered knee ligament damage during Liverpool's tour of the United States three weeks ago but he has been given the green light to start running again at the club's Melwood training base.

Lallana was initially ruled out for six weeks but he has been working hard cut the time he is on the sidelines. If, for instance, he was fit to be included in Liverpool's trip to Tottenham on August 31, he may yet be fit enough to figure in Roy Hodgson's plans for the games with Norway and Switzerland.

Liverpool, however, will not rush him and it seems most likely that he will be available for the game against Aston Villa on September 13.
