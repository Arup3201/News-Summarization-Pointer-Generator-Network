Prince William swigged a generous shot of rum today as he celebrated the £7m restoration of a WWII submarine.

The prince downed the neat shot of 55 per cent proof liquor and was presented with a 'Dolphin' insignia as he became an honorary submariner following a rededication ceremony to HMS Alliance in Gosport, Hampshire.

'Where's everyone else's rum?' William joked as he took the glass of Pusser's Navy Rum from Chairman of the Royal Navy Submarine Museum Vice Admiral Sir Tim McClement and necked it in one.

The prince also joked about how his hosts were lucky his ten-month-old son Prince George wasn't with him on the tour as he would 'be up to all sorts of mischief pulling things'.

During a tour of HMS Alliance, William saw how 65 submariners lived in close confinement for months on end, sleeping in bunks just inches apart 500ft underwater.

The ship was built during the Second World War but wasn't finished until1945 so was used in action for 28 years during the Cold War.

She has been moored by the Royal Navy Submarine Museum quayside since 1982 and her outer structure had corroded severely but after volunteers and Lottery funding raised £7 million she has finally been restored to her former glory.

Cheers to that: Prince William, who is Commodore-in-Chief Submarines and Royal Patron of the HMS Alliance Conservation Appeal, attended the Service of Re-dedication of the newly restored submarine

Veteran Terry Fearnley, 66, who served in the engine room of HMS Alliance from 1968 to 1971, and is now a guide on the vessel, spoke to the Prince about his son.

Terry said: 'I said I thought it was a wonderful thing that the submarine has been restored so faithfully for future generations.

'I told him I hope his son George will come and see it with his family as well. William said "I hope so but you're lucky he's not here, I think he'd get up to all sorts of mischief pulling on things".

'I told him "he can't break anything" and he said "you say that".

'He's such a lovely guy, very easy to talk to.'

Meet and greet: Among his duties for the day, William met descendants of those who died in submarine AE1 in 1914 and paid his respects

Former officer Tim Honnor, 74, who commanded the submarine for 18 months during 1970 and 1971 said William was fascinated in hearing about life on board the vessel.

He said: 'I hadn't been on the submarine for 20 years and I came back to see it restored.

'It's incredible the level of detail they have gone to. It is remarkably similar to how it was when we lived here, down to the photograph of the Queen on the wall.

'William was saying he couldn't believe we all live on here. He said how important it was for future generations to see the conditions.'

Royal duties: The Duke of Cambridge attended a ceremony, which honoured the 5,300 submariners who lost their lives in the two world wars

After arriving by helicopter at midday, the Prince was welcomed by a small gathering of school children and a line-up of Naval Cadets before attending the submarine's official re-dedication ceremony.

On his way in, the Duke stopped to talk to a submariner sporting the most impressive naval beard since the man in the Navy Cut logo.

'He said it was the most fantastic beard he had ever seen,' said engineer/technician Paul McNulty, 22. 'He said, "Look after that beard!"'

The 15 minute ceremony, which also honoured the 5,300 submariners who lost their lives in the two world wars, featured prayers and The Naval Hymn.

Afterwards, William met descendants of those who died in submarine AE1 in 1914.

He expressed hope that the remains of the submarine will be found when a search begins in September, 100 years after she was lost with all hands off Papua New Guinea.

The Royal Australian Navy is sending the minehunter HMAS Yarra to look for the hull of AE1, a British-built E Class submarine lost at sea near East New Britain, Papua New Guinea,, on September 14, 1914 after less than seven months in service.

William met relatives of the 65 crew, who were a mixture of British and Australian submariners.'He said he hoped they find it in September,' said Vera Ryan, 71, from Sydney, convenor of the AE1 Descendant Families Association.

Her uncle, John Messenger, an Engine Room Articifer, perished on AE1 aged 27.

He was her dad's brother and his family never really got over the shock of the loss. 'My grandmother became clinically depressed and never recovered from that,' she said.

Mrs Ryan and her husband Peter, 70, had come over especially for the ceremony. 'It's really wonderful, particularly for the Australian descendant families because this was the first Australian Naval casualty in the First World War,' she said.

'There really haven't been a lot since.'

Meanwhile, the Earl and Countess of Wessex today toured Bath Abbey and re-opened a section of the town's Roman Baths.
