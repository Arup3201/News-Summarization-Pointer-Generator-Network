A 19-year-old student has died after stepping out in front of a pickup truck - apparently after a night of drinking.

Brooke Dawkins, a University of Central Florida student who had been homecoming queen at her high school in Orlando, Florida, passed away on Wednesday, 10 days after she was struck.

The beloved Kappa Delta sorority sister had stepped into the road on Alafaya Trail by the university's campus at 2.30am February 23 even though drivers had a green light.

The truck driver hit the teenager and she was rushed to Orlando Regional Medical Center.

On Tuesday, her brother Brody said that she had been declared clinically brain dead, before recanting this. Medical staff had continued to list her in critical condition.

Florida Highway Patrol spokeswoman Sgt. 
Kim Montes said the UCF police officer who arrived on scene and 
performed CPR on Dawkins smelled alcohol on her, WESH reported.

The driver of the truck was not cited after witnesses said he had a green light, the FHP said.

After the accident, Kappa Delta and friends launched a website, brookestrong.org, to raise money for her care and raised thousands of dollars for her family.

'After a ten-day fight against brain injuries and other medical conditions, Brooke peacefully ascended from this life to the next with her loving family by her side,' said a message on the site on Thursday.

'The original intentions of the Trust was to fund Brooke's recovery. With Brooke's passing, the Trust will use the donations to better the world in Brooke's honor.

'Whether that takes the shape of setting up a scholarship fund, founding a charity organization or funding for medical research remains to be determined by her family.'

Support: Friends and sorority sisters used the hashtag #brookestrong in support of the teenager

Supporters have been using the slogan and hashtag #brookestrong across social media, uploading images of fundraisers and messages of support.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Brooke and her loved ones,' UCF's spokeswoman Courtney Gilmartin told WESH.

Friends paid tribute to Brooke on social media.

'Thankful for the laughter you brought to me on a daily basis,' one friend wrote. 'You have always been so special to me; always will be.'
