Jordan Cobb, who drowned after jumping off a ferry

A teenager who drowned on New Year's Eve after jumping off a ferry may have done so for a £100 bet, an inquest has heard.

Jordan Cobb, 16, was more than twice over the drink driving limit when he leapt from the boat, as it travelled from Devonport in Devon to Torpoint in Cornwall last year.

Plymouth Coroner’s Court was told that the teenager turned to friends and asked: “Shall I jump off?” He then dived off the vessel when it was 230ft (70m) from the shore.

The student was initially seen to resurface and swim but the inquest heard how he quickly disappeared from view in the River Tamar.

Despite a huge search operation Jordan’s body was not found, until January 16 this year, when it was discovered by a ferry worker.

Ian Arrow, coroner for Torbay and South Devon District, ruled that Jordan had died accidentally.

He said: 'He had been to meet with friends and all had consumed some alcohol over a period of time and decided to take the ferry to Torpoint.

'I am satisfied from the evidence I have heard that Jordan decided to dive off the ferry.

'We know he entered the water, sadly I conclude he didn’t leave the water. I suspect he died that day.

'We can’t be certain why he dived off, whether it was bravado or for some other reason. I am satisfied he certainly didn’t expect to die.'

The inquest heard Jordan, from Plymouth, went to celebrate the new year with friends.

Vaughan Boltwood, who had known Jordan for five years, told the inquest they drank Carlsberg and a bottle of Jagermeister together.

Mr Boltwood did not know how much Jordan drank but said he had personally consumed eight cans of Carlsberg in an hour and a half.

At around 8.30pm, the group walked to the ferry and boarded the 9pm boat before playing on games and slot machines.

He told the inquest: 'As the ferry approached the Torpoint side, we all moved to the front side of the ferry so we could get off.

'We were all stood around the area and Jordan Cobb said something like ‘shall I jump off?’ I can’t remember what brought this conversation up.

'We were all laughing and not taking the conversation seriously. I walked towards Jordan and he said to me ‘hold my bag for a second’.

'He handed me the bag, walked outside the passenger door, climbed on top of the barrier and dived overboard.

'I could see Jordan go under the water, he re-emerged and began to swim away from the ferry. I lost sight of him. We all began to panic.'

The group raised the alarm and a large search operation began in a bid to find the teenager.

Holly Glynn, who was out celebrating with friend Nicola Thomas, told how she was walking by the ferry when she saw a group of 'angry lads'.

Miss Glynn recognised one of the group, Jack, as a neighbour’s grandson and began to talk to him and another boy called Nathan.

She told the inquest that Nathan had told her that he felt that Jordan's disappearance was his fault, because he was the one who was supposed to take a £100 bet to do the jump but the missing boy had done it instead.

Miss Thomas, who also spoke at the inquest, said: 'Nathan said ‘it was a bet of £100 and it was me who should’ve jumped it but Jordan did it himself.

'I couldn’t comprehend why anyone would want to do this.'

Detective Constable Barry Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, told the inquest how he spoke to Nathan Watch at his home address.

He said Nathan confirmed there was talk about someone jumping off the ferry but did not see Jordan - who was known as Cobby - jump in.

Ferry worker Philip Barsley discovered Jordan’s body floating on ferry chains in the River Tamar on January 16 this year.

Jordan's body was discovered with his headphones still in his ears and attached to his HTC mobile phone, wearing new trainers.

His body was identified by distinctive tattoos, including one which reading 'In memory of granddad Cobb' on his arm and a five-pointed star on his ankle.

Pathologist Dr Dean Harmse, of Derriford Hospital, said: 'In my opinion, the cause of death was drowning, with the adverse effects of alcohol use.'

Jordan’s blood contained 196mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood, which is more than twice the drink drive limit of 80mg in 100ml of blood.

Dr Harmse added: 'The alcohol concentration is likely to have resulted in an impairment of motor and cognitive function.'

Detective Constable Mike Lugger told the coroner Jordan could not have accidentally fallen from the ferry.

He said: 'We have carried out extensive inquiries, part of that is video and witness statements.

'One of the videos does clearly show that Jordan did dive off the side of the ferry.

'Whether it was for a bet or a prank, we cannot say.'
