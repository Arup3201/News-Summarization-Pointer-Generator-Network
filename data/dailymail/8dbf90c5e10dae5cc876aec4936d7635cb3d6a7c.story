BBC host Gary Lineker has suggested that Luis Suarez's apology for his biting shame at the World Cup has been made to help engineer a move to Barcelona.

The Uruguay striker received a nine-game international suspension and four-month ban from all football after being found guilty of biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during his side's 1-0 victory at the 2014 tournament.

Despite the ban that would not see him return until October 26, Barcelona reportedly remain keen on signing the troubled Liverpool forward - with reports claiming the La Liga club would want him to publicly apologise for the incident first.

After initially denying responsibility for his actions, claiming he had merely collided with the Italian defender, Suarez finally apologised to Chiellini on Monday.

Shortly 
after, former England striker Lineker Tweeted that the apology could be a 
means of securing a transfer to his former club Barcelona.

Barcelona have been linked with an £80million move for the striker as new manger Luis Enrique continues his overhaul at the club following the signings of Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic and Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo.

Further
 reports suggest that should Suarez move to the Nou Camp, the club would
 consider inserting clauses into his contract which would allow them to 
punish him if he were to repeat his actions.

Suarez apologised in s statement on his personal 
website, which was then Tweeted by Suarez, he wrote: 'After several days
 of being home with my family, I have had the opportunity to regain my 
calm and reflect about the reality of what occurred during the 
Italy-Uruguay match on June 24, 2014.

'Independent from the fallout and the 
contradicting declarations that have surfaced during these past days, 
all of which have been without the intention of interfering with the 
good performance of my national team, the truth is that my colleague 
Giorgio Chillieni suffered the physical result of a bite in the 
collision he suffered with me.

'For this: - I deeply regret what occurred.

'I apologise to Giorgio Chiellini and the entire football family.

'I vow to the public that there will never be another incident like.'

Fury: Jose Mujica has called FIFA 'a bunch of old sons of b*****s' in an attack on football's governing body

Uruguayan president Jose Mujica had 
earlier called FIFA 'a bunch of old sons of b*****s' in another attack 
on football's world governing body following the lengthy ban.

The
 79-year-old also described the Liverpool striker's four-month 
suspension from all football, plus nine international matches and a 
£65,000 fine, as a 'fascist ban'.

Asked
 by a journalist what his lasting memory of the World Cup would be, 
Mujica said: 'FIFA are a bunch of old sons of b*****s.' The president 
then covered his mouth to feign shock at what he had just said, but when
 asked by the journalist if he wanted to rectify his comments, he 
responded: 'Publish it.'
