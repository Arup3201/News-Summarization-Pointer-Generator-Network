Sledging is not exactly new and it amazes me that some people have suddenly taken exception to Jimmy Anderson saying a few words. Where were they when Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer played?

We don’t want our players to be robots. We expect a lot of them and we want to see that playing for England matters. International cricket is serious and I would rather see players displaying emotion than going into their shells.

I want to see Anderson taking wickets and going past Sir Ian Botham’s record as England’s leading wicket-taker and it could well be that the way he acts and what he says on the field is what makes him the fantastic bowler he is.

Sometimes when a bowler starts chirping it can be a sign they are losing the battle but that is not the case with Jimmy. It is very much part of his game.

What I would say is that there is a line that cannot be crossed and Anderson does come close to crossing it at times. So if I were England captain I would tell him today to be careful because he will now be a marked man. Be streetwise.

Anderson must avoid incidents like exchanging words with Ajinkya Rahane as the players left the field on the fourth evening at the Ageas Bowl because he is on his last chance and England must ensure that he does not risk a ban again.

The master: Shane Warne was well known for having a few words on the pitch 

Respect: Steve Waugh and Nasser Hussain shake hands

The middle of a Test can be a hostile, lonely place and as a batsman it is you and your mate against 11 and if you could make an opposing batsman feel less comfortable out there with a word or two then that is legitimate to me.

Believe me, there are some who would rather get back to the dressing room than fight it out and it is those a side will target, not someone like Brian Lara who would be woken up and motivated when anybody said something to him.

Steve Waugh would call sledging ‘mental disintegration’ and if Warne would have a word with, say, the non-striker as he walked past him that was all part of the game as far as I was concerned.

India have had some feisty characters over the years, certainly since Sourav Ganguly’s day, and it strikes me that MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja are two of their players who you would not target for sledging. They are street-fighters.

Yet Anderson is a product of the last 20 years and he would have grown up watching the great Australian sides, and others, sledging and not being punished for it. Why should he be now?

If the International Cricket Council want to change that and crack down on sledging then let them make it crystal clear and outline exactly what they do not approve of in their code of conduct. Otherwise, Anderson should carry on.

I have said that if physical contact is involved, that is different and we will never know now what happened between Anderson and Jadeja in the Trent Bridge pavilion. But it was always going to be one man’s word against another, with both sides backing their man, so it should never have got to the stage where the referee was bypassed and lawyers and a judge were involved. The ICC were right to back up the verdict yesterday and now we should all move on.
