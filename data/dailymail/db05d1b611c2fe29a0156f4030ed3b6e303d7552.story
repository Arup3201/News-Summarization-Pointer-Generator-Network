Those with hangovers who need hair of the dog, but can't stomach reaching for a can of beer, can now have it on their toast.

An Italian brewer claims they've created a new way to combine the most important meal of the day with the nation's favourite tipple.

Chocolatier Napoleone and brewery Alta Quota, based in Rieti, north east of Rome, Italy, have produced what they call the world's first spreadable beer.

Dubbed Birra Spalmabile, the ale-flavoured jelly-like creation comes in two flavours with either a dark or a blonde beer.

According to Italy Magazine 'one is delicate, while the other has a more intense aroma and stronger taste'.

Claudio Lorenzini, the owner of the brewery, told the publication: 'This is not the first time in Italy and in Europe that someone has tried to make a non-liquid beer, but the experiments carried out have not been successful because the combination of ingredients was not a winner.

'We believe that we have found the right formula with the use of high-quality products. For us this is the future.' 

The spread is available from the Cioccolateria Napoleone website, priced 7.5 euros. 

It says 'it goes perfectly with simple dishes of fish and shellfish, salads and fruit desserts'.
