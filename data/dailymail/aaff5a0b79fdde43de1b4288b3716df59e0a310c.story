Team Sky rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke was sacked last night after he was hit with a two-year ban for doping.

Tiernan-Locke is the first Sky rider to be charged with doping in the team’s five-year existence and Sir Dave Brailsford, the team principal, said the 29-year-old was axed as soon as UK Anti-Doping’s verdict was confirmed.

‘We respected the process and now it’s been concluded we terminated his contract with immediate effect,’ said Brailsford at the finish of stage 12 of the Tour de France here.

‘We know his violation was from before he joined Team Sky,’ continued Brailsford. ‘We set out to win the Tour with a clean British rider. There’s no place for cheats in this sport and certainly not on Team Sky.’

Asked whether he believed 
Tiernan-Locke had cheated, Brailsford said: ‘If he’s been convicted I 
presume it’s because they think he’s cheated.

‘Our
 ambition is to do it clean and we have done,’ added Brailsford. ‘A 
guy’s cheated before he’s got to our team and there’s quite clearly no 
place for him.’  The ban on Tiernan-Locke, who has been stripped of the 
Tour of Britain title he won in 2012, follows an investigation into the 
rider after a blood test taken in September 2012, three months before he
 joined Team Sky.

The blood
 test, conducted during the Tour of Britain, was the first in 
Tiernan-Locke’s ‘biological passport’ — established by monitoring blood 
values over time — with subsequent tests raising suspicion and prompting
 an investigation that began in September 2013.

Tiernan-Locke
 won several big races in 2012, but he accompanied Team Sky on a 
training camp in Tenerife and it was Brailsford’s team who won the race 
for his signature. His form then dipped in 2013 and he wasn’t selected 
for any of the three Grand Tours.

Asked
 if he felt let down, Brailsford responded: ‘When somebody knows what 
your stance is and they disregard that, you do feel let down by it. But 
if the process is  helping catch people who are trying to cheat, that’s 
all well and good.’

The 
Tiernan-Locke ban created a cloud on an otherwise good day for Sky, with
 Geraint Thomas moving up to 12th overall as Sky’s  Australian leader, 
Richie Porte, remained second.

The
 stage was won by Norway’s Alexander Kristoff, who outsprinted Peter 
Sagan — the fourth time the winless Sagan has finished second.
