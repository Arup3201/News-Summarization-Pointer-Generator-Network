It takes Katie, who is flanked by her father and physiotherapist, around three minutes to get from start to finish.

As she takes each step, hundreds of teary spectators watch on.

The newlywed told WAFB News that she was 'nervous the whole way' and 'shaking so bad.'

'At first my legs got caught up on one another so that was a challenge,' she added.

Prior to her big day, Katie went through months of intense and, at times, painful rehab.

Mike Barwis, a renowned sports trainer featured in the Discovery Channel TV show American Muscle, was the man responsible for getting her in shape.

When she first started physical therapy sessions, Katie had braces from her chest down.

But the ones she wears now start just above the knee. 

She also has rods and plates in her spine, to hold her vertebrae in place.

'It's 90per cent mental,' she said of her battle to walk again.

Bad news: Breland suffered severe burns and was told that she will never walk again

Special goal: Katie has been training with her coach for months so she could take her first steps when she walks down the aisle

Wreckage: Breland missed a stop sign on her way to work and her Nissan was broadsided by a truck

'You just have to believe in yourself enough to say, "No, I don't accept this. I'm not gonna remain in the chair, and I see bigger things for my life."'

Katie's accident occurred in October 2011 when she missed a stop sign that was turned sideways.

A truck hit her Nissan broadside and she flew through the windshield and across the road, landing in a ditch.

Her car landed on top of her. It took an emergency crew 33 minutes to extract her from beneath the engine. 

Severe burns covered three-quarters of her body and two vertebrae were shattered.

Katie was in the hospital for 100 days and had many surgeries, including skin grafts and a surgery where rods and plates were placed to hold her back together. 

But the strong, athletic young woman who has spent most of her life playing sports, was determined to regain use of her legs.

She became even more determined to get moving again after Odie proposed in December 2013.

'I told my sister, I said "I will not get married until I can walk down the aisle, and I won't have it any other way."'Kate recalled.

She and Odie met around three years ago when a mutual friend introduced them before her accident.

The couple lost touch but then reconnected.

Fan base: When she's not training herself, the brunette helps others keep fit at her own gym, Katie’s Shed

On the go: Katie had several dress rehearsals to practice walking in such a big dress as opposed to gym shorts

Describing the moment he saw his blushing bride walking up the aisle in September, Odie said: 'I was just so proud of her. In my mind I'm just encouraging her, "C'mon baby, c'mon baby, you got this."'

Katie had several dress rehearsals to practice walking in dress as opposed to gym shorts.

When she's not training herself, the former runner helps others keep fit at her own gym, Katie’s Shed.

The certified personal trainer holds classes there several evenings each week and also works individually with clients. 

Katie said she is thankful for the support she’s received from the Bogalusa community, with countless people following her progress and participating in fundraisers and events for her.

True love: Last December, Katie  got engaged to Odie Hughes, whom she met three years earlier 

She said she knew from the time of her wreck that she wanted to make the best she possibly could of the situation. 

About a year ago she decided she was ready to share her story, and since that time she has had several speaking engagements each month. 

She has also started a charity called Katie's Cause.

Though it has been a testing few years, Katie said the wreck has changed her life in good ways, too.

‘It’s humbled me. It’s made me see things through completely different eyes,’ she concluded. 

Now she and Odie will be gearing up for their first Christmas together as husband and wife.
