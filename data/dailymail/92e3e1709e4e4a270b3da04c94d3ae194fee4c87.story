I am a passenger in a car tailing another vehicle down a lane in rural Hampshire. Pulling over, the driver of the car in front gets out and unlocks a hefty padlock securing a steel gate.

Passing through, we make our way down a dirt track to a windowless, breeze-block building that stands on its own in the centre of a field.

This is not a clandestine meeting between members of a secret brotherhood. Rather, I am about to discover Hillier Nurseries’ trick to ensure hundreds of plants are in flower this week, when they attempt to land a coveted gold medal at the centennial Chelsea Flower Show.

It’s about 20C outside the building. Step inside and you’ll find a sliding door leading to a cold store where the temperature dives to 1C. Huddled together in the chilly vault are cornus, azalea, rhododendron, viburnum, sophora, pieris, spirea, choisya and many other beauties. All are in full bloom or smothered with buds.

‘Storing plants in here for several weeks holds them back a bit, so they are at their best for the show,’ says Andy McIndoe, 56, managing director of the nursery and driving force behind a floral exhibit that will see 4,000 plants arranged in the Great Pavilion, where more than 100 nurseries will display their wares.

Based on the outskirts of Romsey, near Southampton, the renowned plant business has been established for almost 150 years. Since its first appearance at Chelsea in 1914, Hillier has bagged 72 gold medals and is the Guinness World Record holder for most consecutive golds awarded at the show, with an unbroken string of 67 since 1939 (the show did not take place from 1940 to 1946 owing to the Second World War).

Andy has been responsible for staging the Hillier exhibit for 25 years. He says: ‘I don’t want to be the person responsible for bringing our winning run to an end. I’ve got my own two-acre garden but I don’t get to maintain it at all during May as Chelsea takes over my life.’

The Royal Horticultural Society’s show runs from Tuesday to Saturday on its 11-acre site alongside the Thames Embankment in the grounds of The Royal Hospital.

At the show, Andy and his team are creating a 65ft x 65ft display around the stone war memorial at the heart of the pavilion – the towering obelisk is a permanent structure built in 1849 to honour the soldiers who died in the Battle of Chillianwala during the Second Anglo-Sikh War.

Hillier’s exhibit will be bisected by a slate pathway and feature an open-sided garden building, two circular raised pools measuring 13ft across, and a sculpture by Tom Stogdon, which will echo the shape of the war memorial.

The structural backbone will be softened by shrubs, perennials, climbers, roses, conifers and 40 mature trees. Among the plants will be a quartet of debutantes.

Astelia ‘Silver Shadow’ is an architectural plant with shiny silver, sword-shaped leaves, while Viburnum ‘Le Bois Marquis’ is a compact shrub with fragrant white summer flowers.

Lavandula stoechas ‘Bouquet of Roses’ is a new form of French lavender with dainty blue and pink flowers and scented foliage containing hints of menthol and eucalyptus.

Best of the bunch is Sambucus nigra ‘Blue Sheen’, an ornamental elder that has maroon-purple foliage with a blue tinge. Ideal in a mixed border or grown in a country garden setting, its sprays of pink flowers that appear in early summer are followed by dense clusters of shiny black fruit in autumn.

Not all of the plants destined for Chelsea are placed in cold store. ‘The leaves of some will become drained of colour if they are subjected to chilly conditions, or they could drop both flowers and foliage when moved back outdoors,’ says Ricky Dorlay, 72, master plantsman at Hillier Nurseries.

A veteran of 48 Chelsea campaigns, he estimates that he works seven days a week, 18 hours a day, in the months prior the show. He checks on the plants in cold store at least once a day, along with those grown in the warmth of a state-of-the art glasshouse.

A structural plan for Hillier’s exhibit was drawn up about five months ago, but work began on site just eight days ago. About 13 lorry-loads of plant material have been transported from the nursery to the show ground since then. Four staff members started the building process, but about 25 will be there to work on the display in the next two days to ensure it looks first-class when scrutinised by the Royal Horticultural Society’s judges.

Andy still suffers from butterflies in the weeks leading up to the show. ‘But the nerves soon disappear when you get on site because there’s a hell of a lot to do in such a short space of time,’ he says.
