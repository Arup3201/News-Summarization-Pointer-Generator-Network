Settlement: Dr. Sharon Giese has agreed to pay $2.3 million to the family of a 32-year-old mother-of-two who died following surgery performed by her in June 2009

A high profile Manhattan plastic surgeon who was endorsed by Dr.Oz settled for $2.3 million with a widower after his wife and the mother of his two children died following liposuction.

Dr. Sharon Giese, 49, carried out the 2009 fat-reduction procedure on 32-year-old Adriana Porras, who died from a pulmonary embolism two days later.

Her husband, Pablos Balzola, 39, sued Stanford University-educated Dr. Giese in October 2009, claiming the cosmetic surgeon was negligent and did not return emergency phone calls when his wife began to suffer complications.

Pathologist Mark Taff said in Manhattan Supreme Court that if Porras had been treated quickly for shortness of breath and chest pains, her 'chance of survival would have been substantially increased.'

Giese's defense claimed that the clot traveled to her long 20-30 seconds before she lost her life, leaving 'no time to treat it,' according to The New York Post.

However, it emerged that Giese did not heed her own medical protocols by performing the procedure in her own East 61st Street home office rather than at a hospital.

The $2.3 million settlement was reached in April and made public in Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday.

The payout will be split between, Balzola, his two children and his attorney.

Around $750,000 will go to Porras' six-year-old daughter, Maia and nine-year-old son, Nicholas.

Lawyer, Elise Hagouel Langsam will get $365,000 in legal fees and the remainder to Balzola.

Dr. Giese has appeared recently on Dr. Oz to showcase her surgical skills, including a procedure known as a 'miracle shot' to fix the sagging jowls on a patient.

She has also appeared on the Today show and teaches at SUNY in Brooklyn, New York City.

She has declined to comment personally on the matter.

According to her website, Dr. Giese has been at the forefront of groundbreaking research on the effects of liposuction and cardiac risk factors.

The research has been featured in The Wall Street Journal, CBS News and NBC new.

She is also described as a nationally recognized expert on weight loss surgery and is affiliated with Lennoz Hill Hospital and New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.
