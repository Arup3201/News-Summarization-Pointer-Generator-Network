Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio

Drew Peterson's murder trial finally started today - with two very conflicting stories.

Prosecutors gave jurors an account that could have come from a 1940s pulp novel, in which a man does whatever he must — including murder — to keep his ex-wife's hands off his money.

On the other side, Peterson's attorneys argued the former cop was a victim of something newer - a 24-hour news cycle and cable TV's talking heads, which together created a media frenzy that did not subside until prosecutors had charged an innocent man.

Peterson is charged with first-degree murder in the 2004 death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio.

He is suspected but not charged in the 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson.

Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow told jurors that Peterson, 58, killed Savio, 40, and made it look like an accident.

'Just weeks before her death, he told her he was going to kill her and she would not make it to a divorce settlement and would never get his pension,' Glasgow said during opening statements.

Peterson's real-life drama inspired a TV movie and a national spotlight was put on the case, as many speculated whether Peterson used his law-enforcement expertise to get away with Savio's murder and make 23-year-old Stacy Peterson vanish.

In his opening statement, Peterson's defense attorney, Joel Brodsky, tried to knock down what will certainly be the prosecutors' contention - that the investigation into Savio's death was a shoddy one.

Brodsky told jurors that the Illinois State Police investigators were very experienced, and that the reason the state police conducted the investigation was because the Bolingbrook Police Department wanted to make sure there were no questions since Peterson was one of their officers.

Brodksy even said state police 'bagged' Savio's hand to preserve any evidence.

Brodsky said not one person — from police to prosecutors to Savio's own family— suggested Savio's death was anything other than an accident.

'And the reason was because it was an accident,' he said, adding that there was no sign of a struggle.

'The bathroom was in perfect order,' 
he said. 'There is not one shred of evidence whatsoever that Drew 
Peterson or anybody else for that matter was in that house. Why? Because
this was a household accident, that's why.

'Kathy slipped and fell in a household accident, case closed,' Brodsky said.

Brodsky also suggested that Peterson 
was the victim of a 'media circus' after Stacy Peterson disappeared, 
triggered by the realization that Savio had died. Peterson was charged 
in Savio's death after his much younger fourth wife vanished.

Glasgow brought up Stacy Peterson 
during the prosecution's opening statements, making it clear her 
disappearance was the key to opening an investigation into Savio's 
death. Peterson has denied wrongdoing in both cases.

Glasgow also told the jury what has 
been widely known for years but what Glasgow has not said explicitly - 
There is no physical evidence linking Peterson to Savio's death.

A botched initial investigation into 
Savio's death leaves prosecutors with scant physical evidence.

They'll 
be forced to rely heavily on hearsay evidence — statements not heard 
directly by a witnesses — which is normally barred at trials, as well as
circumstantial evidence to convince jurors of Peterson's guilt.

The first witness called today Savio's close friend and next-door neighbor Mary Pontarelli.

She
cried as she was shown a picture of Savio lying lifeless in her bathtub
before describing the moment she found her body in March 2004.

Mrs Pontarelli
told the court she and her husband Tom, their son Nick and another 
neighbor, Steve Carcerano, entered the home late in the evening after 
Drew told her he could not get in touch with his ex-wife.

She recalled: 'I went into the 
bathroom, seen Kathleen in the tub and I ran out of the bathroom and 
threw myself on the floor and started screaming. '

Peterson checked Savio's pulse and when she asked if she was dead he replied: 'Yes Mary, she is.'

She said she noticed dried blood in 
Savio's hair and blood coming from her mouth, and she had bruises on her
wrists and buttocks.

Mrs Pontarelli said she offered to 
cover Savio with a towel 'because I didn't want people to see her like 
that. But he (Peterson) said we weren't supposed to touch anything and 
we couldn't do that.'

The prosecution is expected to try 
and use statements that Stacy Peterson made to her minister before she 
vanished in which she said that her husband had admitted to killing 
Savio. 

While hearsay is usually barred, if 
the judge admits Stacy Peterson’s statements, the testimony could be 
damaging to Peterson, according to Kathleen Zellner, a Chicago attorney 
who has been following the case.

‘What
the judge is going to do is he's going to wait and make individual 
rulings each time the prosecution tries to introduce hearsay, not give a
blanket ruling, but listen to see if they open the door in some way 
that makes the hearsay admissible. He'll make this a day by day ruling 
on these different pieces,’ Zellner told ABC News.

‘Essentially
we've got Peterson confessing the murder of Savio to his fourth wife, 
but we still have the question of whether that will come in.’ 

Prosecutors
will also try to admit Stacy Peterson's statements to her minister that
she saw Drew Peterson arrive home with women's clothing around the time
of Savio's death.

Savio's
sister may take the stand to describe Savio's statements that Peterson 
threatened her with a knife and said he could make her death look like 
an accident.

‘That
doesn't concern us,’ Peterson's attorney, Joel Brodsky told ABC News 
this week. ‘Anybody that knows anybody that has been through a divorce 
knows that people say things and do things that is totally out of 
character, and clearly Kathy was trying to build a case to try and get 
as much money as she could.’ 

The
outcome of the trial may also hang on which forensic pathologist the 
seven men and five women on the jury will believe: Bryan Mitchell or 
Larry Blum.

Mitchell, 
who investigated Savio’s death in 2004 and ruled that a gash on her head
and bruises on her body were consistent with an accidental fall, died 
earlier this year. The defense will likely call expert witnesses to 
testify that the woman’s death was accidental.

Blum, who investigated Savio's body 
after it was exhumed in 2007, will testify for the prosecution at the 
trial about what made him switch the cause of death from an accidental 
fall to homicidal drowning.

‘First, they are not going to be able
to say that (the death investigation was botched) because it wasn't,’ 
Peterson's attorney said. ‘By saying that if they had done a better job 
in the investigation, then they would have been able to prosecute Drew 
Peterson, that lowers the burden of proof. Where you don't have 
evidence, you presume innocence.’
