An active woman who has shed four stone to fulfil her desire to have children has been told that she's still too fat to adopt.

Donna Adams, 42, who suffers from a hormone condition that makes losing weight harder than normal, was left reeling when her local council said her BMI of 38 exceeds their criteria for adoption.

The civil servant from East Grinstead attends belly dancing classes, goes on long country walks and swims 30 lengths each week yet officials don't  deem slim her enough to become a mum.

Donna  claims that West Sussex County Council said she exceeds their guidelines which require substitute carers to have a BMI of 35.

The council states that it has a 'responsibility to identify and address obesity in substitute carers' and that with a body mass index of 38, she fails to meet its guidelines.

Donna said: 'I understand they need to think about people's lifestyles and the welfare of children, but I can't believe you need to be a certain size to be a good parent.

'I just want people to know what's going on because I'm definitely somebody who is fit and healthy enough to be a mother.

'There are plenty of children in care who need a loving home and loving parents, and I feel bad for them.'

However at despite her activity levels and slimmer body, Donna's BMI is still considered to be in the 'very obese' range on the calculation chart, and just two figures below the 'morbidly obese' range.

Donna and husband Jeremy, 41, have struggled to conceive themselves because she suffers from called polycystic ovarian syndrome. 

She said: 'My body makes too much testosterone and insulin - it causes problems with fertility and makes you bulk up and have a chunky figure. It is incredibly hard to lose weight.

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a way of seeing if someone's weight is appropriate for their height.

BMI can be divided into several categories and generally the higher your BMI, the greater your risk of a large range of medical problems.

Inaccuracies can occur for people who are very muscular as it will result in a higher BMI even if there's a healthy level of body fat.

'It affects about one in ten women, but most of them don't realise they have it until they try for a baby and it doesn't work.'

But thanks to a strict diet and active lifestyle, Donna managed to shed the pounds and went from a whopping 19 stone to 15 stone and is now a much slimmer size 14.

She also reduced her BMI from 48 to 38.

The couple then gave themselves another year in the hope that Donna would fall pregnant after reducing her BMI, before they explored adoption.

But their hopes were soon dashed. 

Donna said: 'I received a letter from West Sussex County Council, which says we can't adopt because I don't meet their guidelines.

'I was so angry about it, I just couldn't believe it. The council has never actually met me. This is all based on a number, which I find to be really insulting.

'I feel like my husband and I have fantastic qualities to become parents. We have six nieces and nephews and we are very much a part of their lives, and the minute we got married all our friends and family started asking when we were going to have kids.'

Donna has pledged to lose another two stone before the end of the summer in a bid to further reduce her BMI.

And the hopeful couple will then apply for adoption again to a local authority or an agency - but have ruled out applying to West Sussex County Council.

A council spokeswoman for West Sussex County Council said: 'There are a combination of factors taken into account before any advice is given to potential adoptive parents.

The civil servant's weight hit 19st but by watching her diet and exercising she managed to slim to 15st

'The health of prospective adopters, including any weight issues, are factors we consider in relation to their capacity to successfully parent children who have already lost their birth family, through to adulthood and beyond.

'There are often a broad range of factors that are discussed with the prospective parents before they apply to adopt and areas they may need to consider changing before starting the adoption process.

'We regret this was not made clear in the letter that was sent and the Adoption Team will be making contact to offer an initial home visit to discuss this inquiry further.' 

Now a healthy size 14, Donna's BMI means she's still considered 'obese' and outside adoption guidelines
