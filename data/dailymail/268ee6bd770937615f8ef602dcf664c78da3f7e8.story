Claims: Mike Hancock (pictured) has repeatedly denied claims he sent sexy texts and made sexual advances towards a troubled female constituent

A Liberal Democrat MP faces a council investigation after he was accused of sending lewd and suggestive texts to a vulnerable constituent.

Mike Hancock is also alleged to have bought clothes and perfume for the single mother, who has since complained about his advances.

Portsmouth City 
Council, where Mr Hancock is also a councillor, said today it had 
decided to refer a complaint against him for formal investigation to see if he broke their code of conduct.

The woman’s legal team claim Hancock sent texts to the woman, one of 
which is believed to have said: 'Thinking as always of u and missing u. 
big kiss xxx.'

Another allegedly states: 'I miss you sexy. xxx.'

Two years ago Hancock's affair with his Russian 
researcher Katia Zatulieveter, 27, was exposed.

Katia, who worked for Hancock at the 
House of Commons, was investigated over claims she was spying for the 
Russians. The allegations were never proved.

Married father-of-two Hancock, 66, who has served as a councillor for 43
 years and as an MP in two spells totalling 37 years, failed to appear 
before the Governance and Standards Assessment Sub Committee at 
Portsmouth Guildhall.

The MP denies the allegations and refused to discuss it has he left his Hampshire home today.

Conservative councillor Donna Jones, who chaired the meeting, said: 'The
 case of the complainant will be referred for investigation.

'Michael Lawther (solicitor for Portsmouth City Council), in conjunction
 with myself, will be writing to the constituent to advise the outcome.'

The woman, who has mental health problems, said she wrote to Nick Clegg in March 2011 about her allegations which she claims breach party rules but her letter was ignored.

She is now suing him over what she said was a ten-month inappropriate relationship.

Harriet Wistrich, solicitor for the alleged victim, said after the meeting: 'We will want to see what investigation it is going to be.

'We will provide them with whatever evidence we can to help with the investigation.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, added: “It’s excellent news.

'I think he should be suspended as a councillor and MP.'

Hancock, who is recovering from heart surgery, retained his seat in 2010 with a majority of 5,200 votes, but now faces pressure to stand down.

The woman said: 'He has tried to get out of appearing for six months saying he is too ill.

'He claims he is too ill to attend yet he has been attending council meetings and parliamentary meetings.'

'It shows disregard for the process. I think it’s disgusting'.

Hampshire Police have already investigated the claims of sexual advances but no action was taken against Hancock.

Mr Hancock is also a city councillor in Portsmouth and still represents the Liberal Democrats at City Hall

City solicitor Michael Lawther said: 'A sub-committee of Portsmouth City Council today decided to refer a complaint against Cllr Mike Hancock for investigation.

'The governance and audit and standards committee (assessment) sub-committee - made up of three councillors - considered evidence of a breach of the council's code of conduct and decided there was a case to answer.

'They made no judgement as to whether or not there had been a breach.

'I will now appoint an independent lawyer to carry out an investigation. We estimate the investigation will take two or three months.

'If a breach is proved against a councillor, they can be censured for their conduct.'

A spokesman for Mike Hancock said: 'There has been a code of conduct complaint against Mike Hancock in his role as a Portsmouth City councillor, which has been considered by the council's assessment committee.

'The committee's role is to assess whether the person was a councillor at the time of the alleged breach of the code and not to investigate the complaint itself.

'There will now be an investigation under the auspices of the city solicitor for the council.

'Mike Hancock vigorously denies that he has broken the code of conduct.

'The allegations have previously been investigated by the police but no further action was taken.

'Mike Hancock will co-operate fully with the investigations of the city council and does not feel it appropriate to comment further.

'In the meantime he is recovering from major heart surgery and will continue to serve his constituents as an MP and a councillor to best of his ability.'
