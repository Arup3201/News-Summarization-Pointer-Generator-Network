Police say they found the young girl after members of the public saw her walking by herself in the area this morning.

At the time, Gosford police told Daily Mail Australia a photo for girl would be released later today if her parents or guardians do not come forward.

Superintendent Danny Sullivan, the Commander of the Brisbane Water local area command, said the community took an active role in this appeal.

'We were able to reach more than 160,000 people via social media alone,' Superintendent Sullivan said.

'On behalf of all of the officers here in Brisbane Water, I would like to extend our thanks to the public for their outstanding support in helping us find this young girl’s mother.'

Ruby, who has been described to have a fair complexion with reddish-blonde hair, was found wearing short pink and white pyjamas.
