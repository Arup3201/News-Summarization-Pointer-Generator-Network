A retired British businessman extradited to the United States over arms dealing charges was today granted bail and will be released later this week, his lawyer said.

Christopher Tappin, 65, of Orpington, Kent, will be released from the Otero County detention centre in New Mexico either tomorrow or Wednesday, his U.S. lawyer Kent Schaffer said.

Judge David Briones set the bond at $1million (£620,000) and Tappin's family must pay $50,000 dollars (£31,000) before he can be released, documents filed at the US district court in the Western District of Texas show.

Tappin, the former president of the Kent Golf Union, was told last month that he must remain in custody while he awaits trial in El Paso, Texas.

Although he is to be released he will be forced to remain in Texas.

Tappin, who faces up to 35 years in jail if convicted of trying to sell batteries for surface-to-air missiles to Iran, originally spent 23 hours a day locked in his cell before being moved to a shared cell.

He denies the charges.

The case fuelled the row over the fairness of the extradition treaty between the UK and the US.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC said Tappin's extradition highlighted problems with the treaty which were not 'readily curable', warning that many Britons were left uneasy when faced with the seemingly harsh and disproportionate sentences in the American justice system.

Other critics of the 2003 treaty, including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, have described it as 'one-sided', but an independent review by retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Scott Baker last year found it was both balanced and fair.

Tappin's extradition follows an investigation which started in 2005 when US agents asked technology providers about buyers who might have raised red flags.

Those customers were then approached by undercover companies set up by government agencies.

Briton Robert Gibson, an associate of Tappin who agreed to co-operate, was jailed for 24 months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to export defence articles.

Gibson provided ICE agents with about 16,000 computer files and emails indicating that he and Tappin had long-standing commercial ties with Iranian customers.

American Robert Caldwell was also found guilty of aiding and abetting the illegal transport of defence articles and served 20 months in prison.
