Prince Charles burst into an impromptu dance on a walkabout yesterday – and earned unexpected praise from the harshest judge on Strictly Come Dancing.

Craig Revel Horwood gave Charles seven out of ten for his efforts.

Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, both fans of the BBC1 show, put their best feet forward on the final stop of their Diamond Jubilee Pacific tour.

crowd gathered in the centre of earthquake-hit Christchurch a dancing 
masterclass alongside psychology student Lisa Shannon

The royal couple were visiting 
Christchurch, New Zealand, when they joined a group of locals jiving to 
Forties swing music on a coin-operated ‘dance-o-mat’ stage.

The dancefloor is a pop-up facility, created by the charitable trust Gap Filler, which has coin operated lighting and sound courtesy of a washing machine that plays tunes from an mp3 player.

For almost two years the organisation has been finding creative uses for open spaces left following the earthquake that struck Christchurch in September 2010 and the second deadly quake in February 2011 that claimed more than 180 lives.

Camilla was the first to take to the dancefloor after she accepted an invitation from Sam Johnson, an undergraduate who was widely praised for organising a student volunteer army to help in the aftermath of the devastating natural disaster.

The Duchess, who is a well known fan of the BBC’s celebrity ballroom dancing show Strictly Come Dancing, held the student’s right hand with hers and they moved at a gentle pace.

One step beyond: Prince Charles had a quicker turn of pace then his wife and twirled his partner Lisa Shannon around then grabbed both her hands

skills

After a few moments Camilla looked 
over to her husband who was watching from the sidelines and said 'Come 
on darling you’ve got to dance too'.

But
it was Lisa Shannon, 57, a psychology student from Christchurch who 
seized the moment and asked the heir to the throne if he wanted to take a turn.

Ms Shannon was out 
of breath after the impromptu dance lesson from the Prince and said: 'If
you don’t ask you don’t get, I just saw him standing there looking a 
bit lonely and I thought I’d ask him to dance.'

The
57-year-old was impressed by his masterful presence on the dancefloor: 
'He led and I followed and I don’t usually follow, but he was definitely
in charge.'

The royal 
couple's twirl on the dancefloor came after they visited a shopping area
of Christchurch city centre to see how retailers and independent 
business forced out of their premises by the earthquake have set up home
in renovated cargo ship containers.

Shoppers mobbed the royals as they walked along Cashel Street meeting retailers in their new homes.

A reminder of the earthquake loomed nearby - a large building being torn down by mechanical equipment.

Survivors of the natural disaster had earlier told the Prince and Duchess their harrowing stories during a reception at Christchurch City Council offices.

The royal couple privately met around 20 people who had been badly injured when buildings collapsed during the 6.3 magnitude earthquake which struck at 12.51pm on February 22, last year.

Widespread damage resulted especially in central Christchurch and its eastern suburbs as the quake's epicentre was close to the middle of the city and buildings had been weakened by the 2010 quake.

More than half the people killed were in the six-storey Canterbury Television Building, which collapsed and caught fire.

Bev Edwards, 54, a nurse from Christchurch is now a paraplegic in a wheelchair after a cafe roof collapsed on her while she was having lunch with her mother.

Ms Edwards said: 'I was in a cafeteria deemed to be safe but the building next door fell sideways on to it and the roof came in.

'I knew I had broken my back and I was eventually carried out on a door used as a stretcher. The lady at a table next to me was killed and my mother sat opposite me and was able to walk out.

'It's incredibly important the Prince came to meet us, we're not people that died, we're here, but there hasn't been a lot of recognition for the seriously injured.'

Charles and Camilla's visit to Christchurch came on the last day of their Diamond Jubilee tour to mark the Queen's 60-year reign that saw them visit Australia and Papua New Guinea.
