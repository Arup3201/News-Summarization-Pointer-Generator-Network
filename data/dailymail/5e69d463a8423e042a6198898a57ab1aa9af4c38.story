There can't be many Playboy Playmates who graduated with honours from college. Then again, there can't be many honour students who are named Playmate of the Month.

Step forward Nikki Leigh. Not only did the 23-year-old graduate with honours from California State University Fullerton last week, but she also became Playboy's Miss May 2012.

The sociology major, whose full name is Nicole Leigh Farnam, is hoping her success as Playmate of the Month will get her one step closer to becoming Playmate of the Year.

Childhood dream: Nikki says she wanted to become a Playmate after seeing pictures of the women in her dad's Playboy magazines

Popular: Leigh meets her adoring fans. The model says she is 'really comfortable in her own skin' and frequently walks around her house in the nude

Leigh said becoming a Playmate was a long-held ambition.

She told the Daily Titan in a previous interview: 'As a 13-year-old, I would get a hold of my dad’s Playboy magazines and thought the women were just stunning. I remember telling my dad that I would one day be a Playmate, and I believe he just brushed me off when I said it.

'My family is very excited for me. I’ve always been a really good student and, in fact, I’m graduating with honors this May.

'My mom is extremely proud and a bit jealous; she is funny. Since I’ve shown her my picture she has been on a diet and working out … She has developed a competition between the two of us.'

As a Playmate, she will feature as a centrefold model in Playboy, which includes nude photographs, and she also got the chance to meet Hugh Hefner

Family approval: She said her parents were proud of both of her achievements but were surprised she was able to do it while studying at college

As a Playmate, she will feature as a centrefold model in Playboy, which includes nude photographs, and she also got the chance to meet Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion.

She said her parents were proud of both of her achievements but were surprised she was able to do it studying at college.

In a video on Playboy Television's YouTube channel, she added: 'I'm sky, kind of, but my personality comes out in different ways, it just depends on how comfortable I get.

'I'm really comfortable in my own skin. I walk around my house nude - and my parents get mad at me.

'The Playmate thing has not sunk in at all. Everyone was saying "oh my God, your life it going to change", but I just like to have fun and see where things take me. I don't want any expectations.'
