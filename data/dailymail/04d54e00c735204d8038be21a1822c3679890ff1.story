Sunderland have revived their interest in Brighton's Will Buckley and are offering £2.5million for the winger.

The 24-year-old, who also attracted interest from Crystal Palace in January, played 30 times in the Championship last season, scoring three goals.

Buckley is also being eyed up by West Bromwich Albion, as Alan Irvine looks to rival Gus Poyet for the signature of the highly-rated Englishman.

In demand: Will Buckley has attracted interest from Crystal Palace previously - now Sunderland want him

Buckley moved to Brighton for £1million from Watford three years ago, and came off the bench in the club’s 1-0 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Brighton boss Sami Hyypia is hoping to return to his former club Liverpool to sign their Jack Robinson on loan.

On target: West Brom are also interested in getting hold of the Brighton man but Sunderland are at the front
