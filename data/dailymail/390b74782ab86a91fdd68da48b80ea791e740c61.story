Eric Clapton has revealed he is ready to retire from touring after more than 50 years on the road.

The 69-year-old British musician said travelling has become ‘unbearable’ and he has concerns about his health, adding that he fears he could end up 'embarrassing' himself.

Father-of-four Clapton, who also became a grandfather last year, claimed in addition that he has lost much of his love for touring because most countries are now a ‘different version of America’.

Family: Clapton, who is the top-winning British artist in Grammy history with 17 awards, married his current wife Melia (pictured together) in 2002, and they have three young daughters - Julie Rose, Ella Mae and Sophie

He told Uncut magazine: ‘There are tons of things I’d like to do but I’m looking at retirement too. I’m 70 next year. I think what I’ll allow myself to do, within reason, is carry on recording in the studio.

‘I don’t want to go off the boil to the point where I’m embarrassing myself. The road has become unbearable. It’s unapproachable, because it takes so long to get anywhere - and it’s hostile.

‘Everywhere. Getting in and out of airports, getting on planes, travelling in cars.’

Clapton added that there could soon be a day when he is no longer able to play the guitar, saying: ‘Maybe. Physically, it might be that I can’t, if it hurts too much. I have odd ailments.’

He married his first wife Pattie in 1979, but they had no children and divorced in 1989. Clapton had another daughter, Ruth, in 1985, as a result of an affair with Yvonne Kelly.

Ruth, who was not publicly revealed as his daughter until 1991, married her partner Dean Bartlett in 2011. They had a boy, Isaac, last June - who became Clapton’s first grandchild.

Clapton, known as ‘Slowhand’, rose to fame in the Sixties as a teenager with The Yardbirds. He also featured in Cream, and his most famous songs include Wonderful Tonight and Tears in Heaven.
