Long-time ABC sports commentator Warren Ryan has called it a day at the national broadcaster, just over a week after he was stood down for allegedly making a racist remark while on the radio.

Warren Ryan used the term 'old darky' during his commentary of May 23's clash between the Rabbitohs and Bulldogs

Late last month Ryan was suspended from the air after he compared a heated exchange between a referee and a player during a rugby league game to a scene out of the classic movie, Gone with the Wind, using the term 'old darky'.

Ryan's colleague David Morrow was also suspended pending an investigation.

The 73-year-old's resignation ends a career of more than two decades with the radio station.

'The ABC has suspended me pending an investigation, so I have resigned to save them the trouble of conducting it,' Ryan told Fairfax.

Ryan said he outlined his reasoning for quitting the station in his letter.

Sticking to his guns, the 73-year-old made no apologies for his remarks.

'In effect, I've brought forward my intended end of season retirement date.'

Ryan also defended his colleague's involvement in the incident.

'As for the injustice done to David Morrow in standing him down, he wasn't even listening when I was comparing a blow-up on the field between the ref and a player to a scene in the film Gone with the Wind,' he said.

'David was busy retrieving other sports results from his smartphone.

'He only rejoined the commentary as I finished describing the humorous movie scene.'

But an ABC spokesman told MailOnline he was yet to see Ryan's letter of resignation.

'Please note no further comment will be made until the investigation is complete,' he said.

During a Sydney Rooster-Canterbury Bulldogs game on May 23, Ryan referenced Gone with the Wind and was heard saying on air: 'There’s a line in the movie where the old darky says – when someone says "quittin’ time" – he says "It’s not quittin’ time, I say quittin’ time".

'Then he yells out ‘quittin’ time!’

'In others words you mustn’t do that, that’s our job.'
