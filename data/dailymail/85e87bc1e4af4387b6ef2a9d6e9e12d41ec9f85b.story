Police say the driver of the vehicle, a 22-year-old San Gabriel woman was intoxicated and veered into a chain-link fence, hitting a tree head on.

Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said the two deceased were 'beyond help' and died at the scene.

Three others, including the driver, had to be cut from the wreckage of their Nissan Sentra.

The driver, whose identity has not been announced, was transported to Los Angeles County USC Medical Center.

She was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs and will be booked when she is discharged from hospital.

The other two victims were taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena.

All three suffered serious injuries in the crash.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the women were out celebrating the upcoming birthday of Ana Cuadra.

Cuadra leaves behind a two-year-old son and a six-year-old daughter. She had recently begun working as a dental hygienist.

Her mother, Marlena Cuadra, told CBS LA that Cuadra and Almanza were best friends.

'I understand that God gave me her, he took her away. He will give me strength,' she said.

The 110 Freeway from Los Angeles to Pasadena is notoriously unsafe, with curvy, narrow lanes and short entrances and off-ramps.

The oldest freeway in California, it was built in 1940.
