A photograph of a mother breastfeeding her severely premature baby for the first time has gone viral after it was removed from Facebook because it ‘breached nudity rules’.

Emma Bond, 24, posted the picture of herself with Carene, who was born 12 weeks early, on Sunday. It was visible only to those she had approved as online friends.

The mother of two was shocked when the site removed it the same day after an anonymous person – presumed to be one of her friends – reported it as offensive.

In protest, she uploaded the image to a pro-breastfeeding Facebook group, and it gained 166,000 ‘likes’. But on Monday, the 22,000 users who re-posted it also had their links deleted.

Carene was born on October 3, weighing 2lb 2oz, but Miss Bond and partner Ashley Kitchen, 30, were warned that she would not live more than three days.

At home in Oswestry, Shropshire, Miss Bond said: ‘Two weeks prior to this being taken, I was told my daughter would die, so to then find yourself able to breastfeed was an incredible step.

‘The original photo was only viewable by my friends and family. 

'Everyone was aware it was touch and go, so I was sharing the special moment with people to show them how far she had come.

‘It was a magical moment and to have it removed the same day for breaching nudity policies was really rubbing salt in the wound.’

Despite her remarkable survival, Carene is likely to have suffered serious brain damage. 

Miss Bond and Mr Kitchen, who owns a children’s play centre, travel to the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford every day to see her.

Thousands have backed Miss Bond online, with women posting breastfeeding images in support. Facebook user Laura Simmonds said: 

‘Trouble with our world today, it’s OK for young girls to post pictures of themselves half-naked but when they see something so innocent and beautiful, it’s an offence. 

Where’s the sense in that?’

After hundreds of complaints, Facebook reinstated the black-and-white photo and said it was ‘removed in error’.

Miss Bond said: ‘I see so many animal cruelty or beheading or child abuse images on Facebook and report them myself, but nothing gets done.

'But something as precious and natural as this is removed instead. I know they put the image back up but it shouldn’t take thousands of people to make a stand for that to happen. 

'I still haven’t got an explanation or apology.’

A Facebook spokesman said breastfeeding photos were never against its standards, but in the past nipples had to be hidden. 

The site wrote to Miss Bond saying its policy had been updated to ‘better examine the context’ of images, allowing breasts to be shown in nursing and mastectomy pictures.

In April last year an American mother criticised Facebook for taking down pictures of women breastfeeding their children from a support page she created for other mothers.

Kristy Kemp, of Sacramento, California, was also barred from the page for days after the images were shared, even though Facebook said it did not ban nursing pictures, MailOnline reported.

It follows a controversy on photo-sharing website Instagram in June which saw a mother’s account deactivated after she posted a pictured of her 19-month-old daughter showing off her belly button.

The Daily Mail told how mother-of-four Courtney Adamo, 33, of north London, was sent an email by the Facebook-owned firm saying the image of Marlow ‘violated the community guidelines’.

And in March, mother Emily Slough, spoke of her outrage after a stranger took a picture of her breastfeeding her daughter in public and uploaded it to Facebook, branding her a 'tramp'.

MailOnline reported how Mrs Slough, from Rugeley, Staffordshire, was photographed when she stopped to feed her eight-month-old, Matilda, on the steps of a restaurant and have some lunch. 

Six years ago, the original decision by Facebook to ban mothers from posting 'inappropriate' photos of them breastfeeding their children caused protests by women's groups in the U.S.

MailOnline reported how the campaign had picked up speed in 2008 when protesters organised a virtual 'nurse-in' on the site, as well as a demonstration outside Facebook's offices in California.
