Two-thirds of Australian fathers would think twice before approaching a child in distress in public over fears they would be labelled a predator, new research shows.

The survey conducted to coincide with the launch of Skynanny.net, a GPS tracking device for children, found that 45 percent of fathers said they would be reluctant to help a child, unless the child was in great distress and action was needed.

And 23 percent of dads would not help lost children under any circumstance.

Parenting researcher Dr Justin Coulson said this reaction was common.

Skynanny.net inventor Jason Petch (pictured), who was abducted as a six year old, said he was inspired to create the device after he lost his daughter Lucy (pictured) at the beach when she was two

'A lot of men I've spoken to in parenting groups, in conversation and in counselling have told me they do prefer to stay away from other children because they're worried about what they'd be accused of,' Dr Coulson said.

'They're recognising that men are by far and away statically more likely to be abusers.

'And they're recognising they would prefer to avoid any situation that would compromise people's perceptions of their integrity.'

Dr Sue Packer, vice chair of the board of the National Association for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, said child molesters had become 'the 21st Century bogeyman'.

The launch of the device coincides with a survey that has found two thirds of Aussie dads would think twice before approaching a child in distress in fear of being labelled a predator. Parenting researcher Dr Justin Coulson (pictured) said this reaction was common

'Everybody is potentially a child molester and we treat people like they are,' Dr Packer said.

'It's almost been a generalised response to no trust men which is a huge problem in many ways.'

Skynanny.net inventor Jason Petch, who was abducted as a six year old, said he was inspired to create the device after he lost his daughter Lucy at the beach when she was two.

‘I couldn’t find her for five minutes and sheer panic, absolute raw emotion goes through your body,’ Mr Petch said.

Mr Petch said it brought back old memories from when he and a friend were abducted and held for 24 hours by an elderly lady in nearby street.

'She invited me across the road to eat some mandarins,' Mr Petch said.

'She locked one of us in the cupboard while she played with other, and threatened to hurt the one in the cupboard if the other one ran away.'

Worried about his own children, Mr Petch couldn’t find a device that suited him, so he decided to invent one himself.

The device is carried on the child and links to the Skynanny.net app, which can be downloaded to any iPhone or Android smartphone.

It provides distance and direction information for users to quickly locate their child, and it alerts the user if a child moves outside of their designated boundary.

It can also be set to detect that your child is moving away and then you are able to stop them before they wander off.

But Dr Packer was sceptical of the usefulness of GPS trackers to prevent child abuse.

Dr Sue Packer from NAPCAN said 'child molesters had become 'the 21st Century bogeyman' ,'everybody is potentially a child molester and we treat people like they are'

'More children are abused by people who are very well known to them than by strangers, and a GPS device is unlikely to change anything at all,' she said.

'The best way to ensure that doesn’t happen is to make sure everybody notices children and make everybody is willing to intervene.

'If you see a child who's distressed to do nothing is really a very scary option.'

Dr Coulson said the devices would be useful for special needs children who are prone to wondering.

'If you’ve got a typically developing child I don't believe that devices that track children's movements are going to be particularly necessary, they're more for reassurance of parents than for safety of children.'
