Charged: Sara Barnes, 26, was arrested for burning down a historic tree while doing illegal drugs

A young model allegedly set a fire that caused one of the world's oldest cypress trees to burn and collapse because she needed light in the darkness to see what drugs she was doing.

Sara Barnes, 26, of Winter Park, Florida, was identified by two witnesses as the person who caused the 118ft bald cypress tree named ‘The Senator’ to burn and collapse on January 16, police said.

The woman allegedly took photos of the fire on the 3,500-year-old tree with her phone but did not call 911 - and authorities found methamphetamine, scales and drug paraphernalia at her home.

One of the first photos seen on her 
public Facebook profile is of clumps of marijuana. Agricultural 
officials searched her home on Tuesday and also confiscated her mobile 
phone and laptop.

Since 
Barnes’s arrest was made public, she has received plenty of harsh criticism because the
 tree - dated by park officials thanks to its ring samples - was a 
beloved historic symbol in Longwood, Florida.

A $30,000 fence is planned to be 
built nearby to stop visitors stealing the remaining portions of the 
tree, or from standing too near Lady Liberty, a neighbouring 
2,000-year-old cypress tree.

The tree made it 165ft before a 1925 
hurricane lopped off its top, park officials say. Native American 
Indians who lived throughout central Florida would use the tree as a 
landmark. 

In the late 19th century it became a popular 
visitor attraction. It was the 
centrepiece of Longwood's Big Tree Park and believed to be the oldest of
 its kind in North America.

It
 was also thought to be the fifth oldest in the world. Firefighters had a
 difficult time getting to the tree at Longwood's Big Tree Park and had 
to run almost a mile of hose to get to The Senator.

Famed: It was named for Senator M.O. Overstreet who donated the tree's land to the state in 1927

Tourist attraction: A plaque at the site of The Senator heralds it as the largest Cypress in the U.S.

The
 tree, which had withstood lightning storms, hurricanes, droughts and 
other harsh conditions, burned for several hours before it was weakened 
so much that it collapsed in less than three hours.

Initially,
 authorities thought it was simply a natural accident and the damage 
from a strike of lightening. A 20ft section of the tree fell off at 
7:45am, and the tree collapsed a half-hour later.

According
 to News13, firefighters had to keep a considerable distance. As the 
heat rose, the top of tree burned, sending burning limbs falling more 
than 100ft to the ground below.

Later,
 a sheriff's helicopter dumped water on the smouldering tree. The 
Senator is named for Senator M.O. Overstreet, who donated the land where
 the tree stands to Seminole County in 1927.
