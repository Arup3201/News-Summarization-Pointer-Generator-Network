Britain's crazy weather took another nutty turn today as snow fell in the Highlands while farmers in the south picked strawberries - and all just days after the country baked in the hottest October on record.

Cairgorm in the Highlands was the first place in the UK to experience the chill of winter as the ski slopes on the Scottish resort experienced the first dump of snow.

The mountain range south of Inverness saw temperatures plunge overnight turning the hillside white.

The Mountaineering Council of Scotland (MCofS) said the snow had fallen where snow patches from last winter had survived through the summer months.

While the south of country baked last weekend, small patches of snow remained on the hillside from one of Scotland's hardest winters on record.

With snow falling overnight in the north, there were hailstorms in the Thames Valley in the south, which baked in 85F heat just days ago.

Hilly areas and country lanes around Hungerford in Berkshire were briefly turned white when hailstones the size of frozen peas pelted the area.

Forecasters are predicting chilly times ahead with frost expected across England at the weekend.

Strawberry picking in OCTOBER! Jill Ivens at Hill Farm, Chesterton, with the unseasonable crop

And yet as parts of Britain shivered under wintery conditions, some farmers have been reporting extremely unseasonable events.

With farmers in Cambridgeshire picking their second crop of strawberries this year and in north Devon, 'spring' lambs have been born four months early.

Farmer Paddy 
Ivens is normally turning his attention to pumpkins but this year he is 
still picking strawberries.

THIS EVENING

Showers will ease, become less widespread and largely confined to 
western parts of the UK overnight. Clear spells will develop elsewhere. 
It will stay windy though, and fall quite chilly in a few sheltered 
rural locations.

FRIDAY

Blustery at first, although northwest winds 
generally easing through the day. There will be sunny spells for most, 
although with some showers, mainly in western parts of the UK.

SATURDAY

Generally cloudy, with periods of rain and brisk westerly winds for 
many. Some drier and brighter spells are likely though, mainly in 
southern England. Temperatures a little above normal.

Mr Ivens, 48, who runs the family farm with his mother Jill, in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, was shocked to see an
incredible two acres of his strawberry plants suddenly bearing fruit 
again this week.

He has
now seen a rush from pick-your-own customers to harvest the late 
strawberries, which have made an autumn comeback for the first time ever
at his Hill Farm in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

Mr Ivens said: 'It is bizarre, we've 
been doing pick your own strawberries here for 30 years and this has 
never happened before.

'The
hot autumn weather has tricked the strawberry plants into thinking it 
is late spring and they are throwing out lots of fruit.

'It's
very strange to see people picking strawberries in October, we're 
normally sizing up for the pumpkin market at this time, but the weather 
is so good no one is interested in them.'

And he is not alone in finding his farm turned upside down by the unpredictable weather.

Farmer Edward Gay from North Devon believes the weather has been responsible for 'tricking' his flock into thinking it was time to mate.

Sheep usually go to ram during warmer weather in August or September and give birth 20 to 21 weeks later in February and March.

But Mr Gay believes the unusually hot spell in April fooled his flock in Riddlecombe, north Devon, into thinking summer had arrived - and they mated five months early.

An unseasonably cold summer followed and the perfect warm spring weather for lambing arrived in the last week.

He said he was stunned when the five spring lambs arrived because he had no idea they were even pregnant.

It was the second time their mothers had given birth this year - which experts say it virtually unheard of.

Second coming: 'Spring' lambs have been born early in Riddlecombe, Devon, after the weather tricked the flock into breeding out of season

He said: 'It took me completely by surprise. I went down early in the morning to feed the sheep and count them as I usually do.

'I noticed one was missing and found her under a hedge scraping at the floor and creating a bed. It was a hell of a shock. She'd already had lambs once this year.

'Then, when I went around the rest of the flock I saw two others had dropped udders too and I ended up with two sets of twins and one single.

'The only explanation I can think of 
is that because we had such a wonderful April they thought it was summer
and had mated again. I've never seen anything like it and it has to be down to the odd seasons we seem to have had this year.'

The suddenly wintery conditions sweeping the country is in sharp contrast to the weekend's weather, when three-quarters of a million sun-worshippers
visited beaches in Brighton and Bournemouth as Britain basked in 
the third hottest day of 2011, at 30c (86f).

Bournemouth council had to pull its 
deckchairs and sun-loungers out of storage and shopkeepers across the 
South-East reported shortages of ice creams due to the out-of-season 
demand.

At RAF Finningley in South Yorkshire 
on Saturday, forecasters MeteoGroup recorded the 30c high, with 
Gravesend in Kent reaching an exceptional 29.6c (85.3f).

Both temperatures beat the record for 
October – 29.4c (85f) in Cambridgeshire in 1985 – and ensured the UK 
boasted better weather than almost all of Europe, the Caribbean, the 
Middle East and the Sahara.

Laghouat, the Algerian city on the northern 
edge of the desert, managed only 22c (72f).
