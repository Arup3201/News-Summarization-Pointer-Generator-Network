Harry Redknapp has told Adel Taarabt to concentrate on getting fit for QPR rather than agitating for a January transfer.

Taarabt's agent has claimed the midfielder has been told he can leave the club in the next transfer window, but Redknapp believes there is no interest in the Morocco star.

Taarabt continues to battle ankle trouble, with Redknapp claiming the 25-year-old struggles to stay in shape.

Taarabt spent a loan spell with AC Milan but Redknapp says the Italians are not interested in permanent move

Redknapp said QPR will only entertain Taarabt leaving on a permanent transfer, with the west London club holding out for a £4.5million fee.

Taarabt spent time on loan at AC Milan last season, but former Spurs boss Redknapp believes the San Siro club have cooled interest in a long-term deal.

'Well I know nothing about that; the first thing he needs to go is to get fit and start playing football here, isn't it?' said Redknapp.

'That's all we want Adel to do is, to be fit to play for QPR.

'I don't where he's got the green light to leave in January from, he had the green light to leave in the summer, but there was no one, Milan didn't come in for him.

'He's always had the green light if somebody wants to pay the money the club wants for him.

'If they don't pay the money he stays here.

'But I need him fit, I want to get him fit, he's a good player, a real talent, I just want to get him out on the training ground every day, get him fit and playing for QPR, that's my only interest at the moment.

'Milan don't seem to be interested in him now, no.'

Rangers take on West Ham at Upton Park in Premier League action on Sunday, bidding to hit back from 2-1 defeat at Southampton.

Brazilian midfielder Sandro was withdrawn from action at St Mary's last weekend after suffering a knock to the head.

The former Spurs star will be fit to face West Ham, but Redknapp admitted Joey Barton and Jordon Mutch are still battling hamstring trouble.

'We're not sure who will be fit really, we've got to have a look at one or two of them,' he said.

'We won't be sure until we get through today, then we'll see how they are.

'The knock on the head to Sandro was just a thing that happened, he's recovered fully so hopefully he'll be okay.

'We need to tighten up, but it's been difficult because I've brought some midfielders into the club and they've never been fit to play.

Joey Barton is one of several Rangers players rated doubtful for Sunday's match against West Ham

'We've never got them on the pitch at one time, there's always been a problem.

'Sandro's come in and been injured, Jordon Mutch has been injured, Joey Barton has been injured so it's been difficult really to get a real settled group in there.

'You need midfielders to weight in with goals, they have to score and if they're not doing that they're not producing.'
