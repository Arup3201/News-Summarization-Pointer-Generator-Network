When the president has some downtime, he likes to unwind like the rest of us - binge watching television shows.

Recent reports quote the President as saying he'd rather hang out with the 'Duck Dynasty' family than the Kardashian clan, but reality TV aside, Obama's a fan of high-quality TV drama, with the occasional comedy for good measure.

It seems Obama seeks escapism through some of the critically-acclaimed series produced by the cable networks.

Art-imitating-life shows like 'House of Cards' and 'Homeland' are obvious choices, but the president is also drawn to darker fare, such as AMC's 'Breaking Bad.'

According to a recent New York Times report, the president is working his way through the box-set of 'Breaking Bad.' Although the series ended recently, he's understandably behind and reminds those around him not to spoil the ending.

The Times also reports that the President is eagerly awaiting the second season of 'House of Cards,' the political drama centered on Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), a Democrat who, after getting passed over for appointment as secretary of state, decides to exact revenge.

'I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient,' Obama was overheard saying to Reed Hastings, the Netflix CEO, who invited the president to do a cameo on the show, the New York Times reports.

Obama joked of the sleazy, congressman-murderer Mr Underwood, 'This guyâ€™s getting a lot of stuff done.'

Proving he has his finger on the pop- culture pulse, President Obama has also claimed to be a fan of 'Game of Thrones,' 'Boardwalk Empire,' and even the BBC's massive hit 'Downton Abbey.'

Cementing his status as a bona fide TV aficionado, Obama has repeatedly remarked that HBO's 'The Wire' is one of the greatest television shows of all time.

The now-defunct cult hit focused on the hard streets of Baltimore's projects and a drug war carried out between the city's cops and its hardout drug dealers.

David Simon, the show's creator, pondered whether Obama liked the show because it so clearly dealt with issues of socio-economic strife.

'"The Wire" was one of the few shows that was about the other America,' Simon told the New York Times.

'It was set in the inner city. The characters were of a class that has been left behind economically and politically.'

Family viewing: The President and his family are also fans of lighthearted comedies Parks and Recreation and Modern Family

In a speech this month, the President vowed to spend the remainder of his presidency fighting against the kind of poverty depicted in 'The Wire.'

'The idea that a child may never be able to escape that poverty because she lacks a decent education or health care, or a community that views her future as their own,' Obama said, 'that should offend all of us and it should compel us to action. We are a better country than this.'

On the lighter side, though, President Obama has also mentioned that he and his family like to watch comedies such as Parks and Recreation and Modern Family together.
