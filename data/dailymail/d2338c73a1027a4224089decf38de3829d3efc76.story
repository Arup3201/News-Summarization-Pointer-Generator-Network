Aaron Hernandez has been charged with the double murder of two strangers in 2012 after leaving a Boston nightclub in 2012 and prosecutors say that it stemmed over a spilled drink.

The states' attorneys detailed the charges and the evidence against Hernandez at a Wednesday afternoon hearing and said that one of his alleged victims bumped into him at a nightclub and spilled a drink.

That interaction allegedly set Hernandez, who previously played as a tight end for the New England Patriots football team until being tied to the murder of his acquaintance Odin Lloyd in 2013.

Hearing the details: Aaron Hernandez is already charged for a 2013 murder of an acquaintance but now he faces double murder charges stemming from a 2012 drive by shooting after a night club interaction gone wrong

His side: Hernandez, 24, has entered not guilty pleas in connection to all three murders

Hernandez has pled not guilty to all three of the murders, which are being tried in two separate cases.

The prosecuting attorney went through the evening on July 16, 2012 that led to the drive-by deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado.

'I think I got one in the head and one in the chest'

The shooting had long been an unsolved murder but police reopened the case following the murder of Lloyd because there was speculation that Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating Hernandez's fiancée’s sister, had some information about the 2012 double murder.

Hernandez was reportedly acting paranoid and believed that people were 'testing, trying and or otherwise disrespecting' him at the nightclub, and those feelings came to a head when de Abreu reportedly bumped into Hernandez while dancing, causing the then-professional football player to spill his drink. 

He reportedly thought that de Abreau smiled after the incident and did not apologize, which caused Hernandez to get upset. The prosecutor claimed that Hernandez had two more drinks and watched de Abreu and his group from inside the club so that he would know when they were leaving.

Bail denied: Hernandez, seen at left in court on Wednesday, is already being held without bail due to the 2013 murder charge but his bail request connected to this 2012 double murder was also denied

The prosecutor told how after leaving 
the club on the night of July 16, Hernandez got into the passenger seat 
of an SUV that he was test driving while his friend got behind the 
wheel.

Victim: Odin Lloyd was found murdered near to Hernandez's apartment last summer

They proceeded to follow the car that de Abreu and Furtado, who was pictured by the local CBS affiliate, got into when they left the club.

After Hernandez's car 'pulled up close along the passenger side of the car... (Hernandez) leaned out with a loaded .38 revolver,' the prosecutor told the court, and Hernandez reportedly said '"Yo what's up now" and then a racial slur.'

He 'immediately fired at least five rounds from the .38 revolver.... (and) continued to pull the trigger even after the round was finished.'

The prosecutor did not say how he got the following information, but he told the courtroom that Hernandez proceeded to say 'I think I got one in the head and one in the chest' as his friend sped the SUV away from the crime scene.

He went on to explain how the Bristol,
 Connecticut native and his friend drove to his cousin's house in that 
town and spent the night there, saying that Hernandez 'searched the 
internet and media accounts for the Boston shooting'.

The
 cousin, reportedly brought a second car for Hernandez to drive home the
 next day and the SUV that was used on the night of July 16 remained 
untouched in her garage for months, even accumulating spiderwebs.

Not talking: Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee and the mother of his daughter, was at the court hearing on Wednesday (pictured) but did not speak to the media

Heartbreaking: The relatives of Hernandez's two alleged victims got emotional at the Wednesday hearing

Support: The two women held each other after the hearing- which lasted about 20 minutes- was over

Hernandez's attorney strongly objected to the night being recounted in such specific detail, arguing that the court was being turned into a media 'spectacle' that would 'poison' the jury pool against the former NFL star.

'The defendant has been subjected to an avalanche of publicity none of which we are responsible for,' Hernandez's attorney said.
