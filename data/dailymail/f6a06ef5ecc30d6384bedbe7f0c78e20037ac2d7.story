The FBI is warning law enforcement agencies across the country that the grand jury decision over Michael Brown's shooter 'will likely' lead to violence by extremist protesters.

As the city of Ferguson waits on edge to see whether police officer Darren Wilson will be charged in the death, the agency has issued a bulletin warning departments across the country of potential dangers.

It warns that peaceful protests could be interrupted by extremists, while 'hacktivist' groups like Anonymous could also use it as an excuse to launch cyber attacks on authorities, reported ABC. 

'The announcement of the grand jury's decision… will likely be exploited by some individuals to justify threats and attacks against law enforcement and critical infrastructure,' it said.

The agency warned that the extremists could be carrying 'bladed weapons or firearms' and be 'equipped with tactical gear/gas masks, or bulletproof vests'. 

The bulletin, seen by ABC, says there have already been threats against law enforcement, including a message last week by a black separatist group offering 'a $5,000 bounty' for Wilson's location.

It adds that the extremists may also threaten peaceful, legal protests carried out by demonstrators - both in Ferguson and across the U.S.

After the bulletin was issued, some police departments issued internal memos urging officers to review procedures for responding to mass demonstrations, ABC reported.

On edge: The city is awaiting a grand jury's decision on whether Police Officer Darren Wilson, pictured, will be indicted for the teenager's death. If he is not indicted, authorities predict massive protests

Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency in
Missouri but said troops from the state's National Guard would play a backup role to police in
response to any protests that develop.

People around St. Louis are braced for a possible new wave
of protests similar to those that followed the August 9 shooting of Brown, particularly if Ferguson
police officer Darren Wilson is not charged. 

Officials have said the grand jury's decision is likely to
come this month.

Nixon on Tuesday was due to swear in the members of a new
'Ferguson Commission,' a group charged with reviewing the social
and economic conditions that contributed to the unrest that
followed Brown's death and coming up with suggestions for how to
improve them.

More than one out of five residents of Ferguson, a
predominantly black city of about 21,000 people, live below the
poverty level, a rate that is above the state average, according
to U.S. Census data.

Nixon declined to say how many National Guard troops would
be assigned to the St. Louis area or where they would be
stationed. 

Fight: A demonstrator peacefully protests the death of Michael Brown. The FBI have warned that extremist violence also threatens to interrupt peaceful, legitimate demos in the wake of the grand jury's decision

Haunting: Demonstrators lay on the ground on Sunday in a mock death protest of the shooting of Brown

Peaceful demonstrations were held around St. Louis on Sundayand Monday and some local leaders expressed frustration overNixon's state of emergency declaration. 

'The National Guard is called in when policing has failed.
Military presence in my city will mark a historic failure on the
part of (government),' Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman,
said on Twitter. 

'This is not a war. There is no military
solution.'

Police in Ferguson were criticized for taking a military
posture in response to the August demonstrations, regularly
deploying officers in riot gear and using tear gas and rubber
bullets against crowds that torched two businesses in the St.
Louis suburb and at times threw rocks and gasoline bombs at
police.

Police in St. Louis County have since gone through conflict
de-escalation training and activist leaders have also been
training potential protesters in nonviolent techniques in recent
days.

County police will take the lead in handling any protests
or civic disorder, supplanting the Ferguson Police Department,
Nixon said.

Preparation: Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, pictured last week, has eclared a state of emergency

St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay said his city's police force
would respond to demonstrations in their normal uniforms unless
conditions became violent and that National Guard troops would
not play a primary role in responding.

Some area schools have told parents they will dismiss
students early when the decision comes and many businesses near
the stretch of downtown that saw the worst rioting after Brown's
killing have boarded up their windows as a protective move.

There are conflicting accounts of what happened, with some
witnesses saying Brown had his hands up in surrender when he was
shot and others describing a scuffle between Brown and Wilson.
