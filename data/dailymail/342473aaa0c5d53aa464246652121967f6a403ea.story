David Cameron has brokered a bizarre deal which will see China spend millions of pounds importing semen and trotters from British pigs.

Downing Street said the semen deal agreement, which will be worth £45 million to UK firms, indicated it was doing all it could to ensure that all types of businesses reap the rewards from our relationship with China.

China is home to half of the world's pigs, and its Communist leaders are apparently keen to improve the quality of its herds since the Chinese rely on pork for much of their protein intake.

China wants to increase the efficiency of its production, whilst minimising the environmental impact.It is hoped that the UK industry can play an important role in helping China achieve greater efficiency through the provision of high quality genetic stock.

Britain is lobbying Beijing to also be allowed to export pig trotters, which are a waste product in the UK pork industry but are widely eaten by Chinese diners.

Exports of trotters could be worth as much as £7.5 million a year to the industry in Britain.

The first exports of porcine semen will commence in the first quarter of 2014.

A Downing Street spokesman said: 'We're doing all we can to ensure that businesses up and down the country reap the rewards from our relationship with China. And that includes our pig farmers.

'This new deal to export pig semen will be worth £45 million to UK firms and means Britain's best pigs will help sustain the largest pig population in the world.

'And we're not stopping there - we're talking to the Chinese about serving up pigs trotters on Beijing's finest dining tables.

'That would be a real win-win - a multimillion-pound boost for Britain and a gastronomic treat for Chinese diners.'

The Prime Minister has used the trip to strike a series of deals between the UK and China

Four Artificial Insemination (AI) centres based in England and North are expected to start exporting in the New Year. They are based in England and Northern Ireland.

UK semen will be key to help the Chinese improve their pig production and make the industry more productive in the long term.

The protocol for porcine semen agreed with the Chinese will allow the shipment of both fresh and frozen semen to China.

It is the latest in a string of deals struck between Britain and China during Mr Cameron's three-day trade visit this week.
