A Florida judge ordered a rude public defender to leave his courtroom before punching him in the head, witnesses have said.

The scrap began during a court session in Viera, where Judge John Murphy asked Brevard County public defender Andrew Weinstock to waive his client's right to a speedy trial.

But Weinstock, whom some witnesses branded as 'disrespectful' towards Murphy, said he would not.

In a confrontation captured on the courtroom camera and shared by CBS affiliate WKMG, the judge snapped back at Weinstock.

Argument: A courtroom camera in Viera, Florida captures Andrew Weinstock (pictured in black jacket and light pants) refusing to sit down when Judge John Murphy (off camera) tells him to

Anger: The judge asks him if he wants to fight and both leave the room. Weinstock can be seen striding out

'If I had a rock, I would throw it at you right now,' Murphy, who is off camera, can be heard saying. 'Stop pissing me off. Just sit down. I'll take care of it. I don't need your help. Sit down.'

But Weinstock responded: 'I'm the public defender, I have the right to be here and I have a right to stand and represent my clients.'

'Sit down,' Murphy said again. 'If you want to fight, let's go out back and I'll just beat your (expletive).'

'Let's go right now,' Weinstock said before striding out of the courtroom.

They both went into the hallway and those left behind in the courtroom could still hear the fight.

Impressed: Other people in the courtroom, including witnesses, left, applause when the judge returns - alone

Witness: Amanda Strohofer, who was in the courtroom, said that the public defender disrespected the judge

Murphy 
allegedly grabbed Weinstock by the collar and started hitting him, 
according to the public defender's office, WKMG reported.

One of them can be heard yelling: 'You want to (expletive) with me?'

A
 Brevard County sheriff's deputy stepped in and stopped the fight, and 
Murphy returned to the courtroom - where he was met with smiles and 
applause. Weinstock did not return.

Another public defender told the news channel that Weinstock had apparently been hit in the head, but neither party pressed charges. 

A
 woman who was in the courtroom as a witness in another case said she 
felt things got heated because Weinstock was 'extremely rude'.

Scene: The scrap took place at the justice center in Brevard County, Florida but no one pressed charges

'I thought it was crazy, but you know what? You don't have to disrespect the judge in his own courtroom,' Amanda Strohofer said. 

WKMG legal analyst Luis Calderon said both men could face disciplinary action and, at worst, they could lose their jobs because of the amount of attention the story has attracted.
