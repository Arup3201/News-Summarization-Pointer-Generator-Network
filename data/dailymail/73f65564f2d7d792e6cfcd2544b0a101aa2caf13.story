A 44-year-old man is suspected of using a hammer to bludgeon to death his girlfriend and her adult daughter because he believed they were 'witches' and performing voodoo on him, law enforcement sources told the New York Post.

Carlos Amarillo was taken into custody early Wednesday morning after police found the dead bodies of girlfriend Estrella Castaneda, 56, and her 25-year-old daughter Lina in the Queens, New York home the three shared.

Lina was mother herself to a 7-year-old daughter who was home at the time but uninjured in the attack and is now in protective custody. Sources told WABC that she slept through the brutal killings.

Amarillo has since been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon.

Law enforcement sources told the Post that Amarillo confessed to killing the two women who he said were 'doing voodoo on him'.

Investigators recovered a bloody hammer on the scene which they believe Amarillo used to bash in the heads of the two women.

Neighbor Camilo Alvarez, 23, told the Post that he could hear hammering that night but had no idea the tool was being used on the two women.

'Around midnight we heard loud hammering. It was loud. I work in construction so I know what a hammer sounds like. I can’t believe it was the sound of someone getting hit. It sounded like someone was swinging that hammer hard,' Mr Alvarez said.

'I didn’t hear anybody screaming,' he added. 'About 15, 20 minutes later the police came and arrested someone in the front yard. I can’t imagine what they went through. It’s disgusting. I’ve been up all night, I couldn’t sleep.'

Another neighbor was surprised to see the action around the Queens home this morning.

'They were a quiet family. I'd always see them walking down the street to do laundry or to go to school. They looked like they didn't have a care in the world. ... The mother and daughter were always together. They even looked alike,' neighbor Steve Perez, 32, told the New York Daily News.

Loud noises: Neighbors said they heard hammering last night, but had no idea it was being carried out on the two women

Asleep: Sources told WABC that it appeared the 7-year-old slept through the attack
