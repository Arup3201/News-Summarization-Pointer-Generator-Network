A New York grandfather whose high school class ring was stolen from his wedding reception 40 years ago has been reunited with the memento - after it turned up in Greece.

Stan Ostapiak, a retired police officer from Staten Island, was stunned when he received a call saying the ring had been found by a Greek student among his late father's belongings in Naxos.

The man, Vasilis Polykretis, tracked down Ostapiak with some internet sleuthing and sent the ring 5,000 miles back to its owner earlier this month.

'It doesn't fit me anymore,' Ostapiak said. 'But my wife will put it back on her key chain, so we can go steady again.'

Joy: Stan and Elaine Ostapiak grin as they show off Stan's high school class ring, which was recently found by a man in Naxos, Greece. It had been stolen from their wedding reception more than 40 years ago

Returned: The ring, which Ostapiak gave to Elaine when she was still his girlfriend, doesn't fit him anymore

Ostapiak, 69, graduated from a Manhattan high school in 1962 and presented the ring to his wife, Elaine, when she was still his girlfriend.

The ring was important to them, he said, because the students couldn't afford to have a prom so it was his only memento from his high school years.

Elaine put the ring on her keychain but at the couple's wedding reception in Queens on October 29, 1972, her purse was stolen - along with the keys and ring, as well as a few dollars.

The couple assumed that was the last they would see of it - until Polykretis came across the ring while looking through his late father's belongings.

Journey: It is not known how the ring ended up in Greece after it was stolen, but it was found by a man on a beach. After the man passed away, his son found the ring among his belongings

His father had found the ring on a beach in Greece in 1980, although it is not known how it got there.

Polykretis noticed that it had the name of Seward Park High School in New York engraved inside, as well as the initials 'S.J.O'. He began searching on the internet for clues to its owner.

While the school closed in 2006, it still has an active alumni association, so Polykretis emailed its president, Martin Kane, the Staten Island Advance reported.

Kane fetched a yearbook from 1962 and scoured the names for anyone with the initials 'S.J.O' - and only Ostapiak matched. He called the couple and left a message on his voicemail.

Elaine, who picked up the message, said: "I said, 'How could this be?' But it was 
just too specific - it had to be true. I said, "Stan you have to listen to this message!" And when he did he was so 
excited.'

Clues: The Greek man who found the ring saw that it had the initials 'S.J.O' inside, which allowed the president of the school's alumni association to identify Ostapiak as the owner

Kindness of strangers: The man, Vasilis Polykretis, offered to host the couple if they should ever visit Greece. 'It's really unbelievable that strangers went through the trouble of doing this,' Ostapiak said

Polykretis sent the ring by registered mail, polished and gleaming in a new box, along with a postcard.

'I hope this ring brings you joy and happiness, and maybe some old memories,' he wrote. 'If you're ever again in Greece, we'd be more than happy to host you.'

The couple, who spend their time looking after their seven grandchildren, said they'll 'maybe' visit the island if they can.

'It's really unbelievable that two strangers went through the trouble of doing this,' Ostapiak told the Staten Island Advance. 'That's what really got to me - what really impressed me. I'm so appreciative.'
