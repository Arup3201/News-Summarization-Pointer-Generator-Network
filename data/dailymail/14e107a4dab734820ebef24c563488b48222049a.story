It's not easy being beautiful! Poor Keira Knightley

The phrase 'nobody likes a show-off' doesn't apply to the realm of celebrity, where boasting about your natural gifts, fame and achievement while pretending not to do so has become something of an art form.

The actress Keira Knightley demonstrated it this week, bragging about her greatest asset by seeming to dismiss it. 

Discussing her striking looks, she said: 'Obviously they got me contracts... but there have been as many, if not more, parts that I haven't got because of the way I look.' 

Ah, poor love. The stresses you have to deal with.

But Keira is not alone. In fact, a new word has been invented for these boasting-by-stealth celebrities who tell us how marvellous they are while disguising their vanity with a quip. 

It's called the Humblebrag - and is nowhere better demonstrated than on the internet, as these examples, all from Twitter, show...

Stephen Fry: Oh dear. Don't know what to do at the airport. Huge crowd but I'll miss my plane if I stop and do photos… oh dear don't want to disappoint. 

Michael Owen: Somebody obviously told people I was there as a load of kids were waiting for my autograph afterwards! #embarrassing

Gregg Wallace: Met girl on beach who has a picture up at work of my wedding day with her head superimposed over my wife's. How do you respond?

Salman Rushdie: The desk is almost clear. Work on memoir, film all but done. Maybe I can allow myself the weekend off before beginning work on my TV series?

Ashley Judd: Awkward moment. Boarding a sold-out flight & hearing flight attendant announce the in-flight movie is one of mine. #Dolphin Tale.

Rio Ferdinand: Open training session tomorrow ... just getting my left hand ready for a colossal signing session afterwards at the stadium! #handache

Peter Jones: At the national Reality TV awards. You're not going to believe it (I don't yet) but just won Celebrity Personality of the Year! #cantberight

Emma Watson: It's been ten years but I still feel so uncomfortable with being recognised. Just a bit shy still I suppose

Ricky Gervais: There is no way to make this next sentence sound normal. I'm just off out to do a benefit gig with Bruce Springsteen. See. Told you.

Gok Wan: So weird to be back and know my collection is being worn around the country ... #humbledandproud

Dara O’Briain: Now, please God, let your telly be free of me for a while. Oh s***, Mock the Week is still on ...

Tinie Tempah: I can't do the 'mean stare' @ bad drivers in traffic anymore cos they just go 'Oh look it's Tinie Tempah' & start waving, then I wave back

Khloe Kardashian: Wow! I still can't believe I have a Cosmo cover #randomtweet

Sue Perkins: Had fun [on the Graham Norton Show]. Met a Dame, a movie star & shared a valentine with a pop icon. Now hanging wet socks on the radiator #backtoreality

Kanye West: I appreciate having the most nominations at the Grammies but I feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely... illogical

Cat Deeley: So I have to go to both Emmy awards!! . . . Two dresses!!!?!?

Simon Pegg: Steven Spielberg just name checked me and @nickjfrost, I jumped off the bed and hurt my thigh. #swingsandroundabouts

Taylor Swift: I love you guys we got an album of the year nomination and I am too excited to use punctuation.

Shakira: I always wanted to have a lot of friends but I never imagined it would be so many... 86m! So humbled, can't thank you guys enough for your support. I feel so fortunate to have you.

Jeremy Clarkson: If your A-level results aren't joyous take comfort from the fact I got a C and two Us. And I have a Mercedes-Benz.

Martina Navratilova: Well done @serenawilliams, what a gutsy comeback in the third set - you are catching me and Chris [Evert], and I don't like it

Simon Cowell: Just seen the TV ad for the unauthorised book on me. Yikes!

Derren Brown: Am a guest at Cirque Du Soleil launch, Albert Hall. Tried to sneak past red carpet but was made to go back and do it. I'm a rubbish celeb.
