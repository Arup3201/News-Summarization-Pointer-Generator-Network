Russia's anti-gay stance was thrown into confusion today by speculation that fake lesbian pop duo tATu will be the surprise performers at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics.

The line-up for the February 7 opening ceremony is a closely guarded secret, but flame-haired singer Lena Katina yesterday tweeted 'we have been invited to take part at the Sochi Olympics'.

The announcement follows worldwide criticism of Russia over recently passed laws held to be discriminatory against gays.

Katina and her bandmate Yulia Volkova were just teenagers when they burst into worldwide musical superstardom with their critically acclaimed 2003 single All The Things She Had.

But the duo also courted controversy with a risque music video which showed them standing in the rain and sharing a passionate kiss while dressed in revealing school uniform-like outfits.

Children's groups in Britain reacted with outrage amid claims their act was a marketing stunt promoting homosexuality among vulnerable teenagers.

So speculation that tATu will be one of the acts at Sochi comes as a surprise with Russia currently mired in controversy after new laws were passed in the country which ban homosexual 'propaganda' to children.

The legislation is drawn so widely that there are fears it could trap gay visitors or competitors in Sochi - or even tATu themselves.

Mayor of Sochi, Anatoly Pakhomov, was quoted this week saying there are no gay people in his Black Sea resort.

Earlier Putin said gay people could feel 'relaxed' about attending the Sochi Olympics but they should 'leave children alone please'.

However, the appearance of tATu at the Winter Olympics opening ceremony is not yet confirmed.

Katina, now 29, later withdrew her post announcing their appearance, replacing it with a message stating: 'All statements will be made at the right moment. As it turned out, this was not yet the right moment.'

Despite this, a number of major news websites reported that the controversial duo will be on stage in Sochi.

'Lena Katina and Yulia Volkova from tATu will be singing at Sochi Olympics opening ceremony,' stated news outlet gazeta.ru.

Montages of Katina and Volkova, 28, posing with the Olympic symbol were posted on the group's social network site, but there were also claims it could be a publicity stunt.

Katina also criticised the organisers for 'disgustingly bad organisation'. She ranted: 'They treat artists like **it.'

Although the pair are now both grown up women in their late 20s, images of Katina and Volkova still show them posing as schoolgirls. Despite officially splitting in 2011, the duo recently performed together.

Volkova is reported to be currently in Moscow having undergone Botox treatment in her lips. She has two children - a daughter Viktoria, aged 9, and son Samir, 6 - from two marriages.

Katina wed Slovenian musician Sasho Kuzmanovich in August last year.

Russian Olympic chiefs declined to comment on any role for tATu.
