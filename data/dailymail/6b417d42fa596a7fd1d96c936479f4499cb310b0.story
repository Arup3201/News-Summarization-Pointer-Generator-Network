Carroll has revealed he is desperate to make up for lost time over the Christmas period

Former TOWIE star Mucklow and Carroll started dating in the summer of 2013 but managed to keep their relationship under wraps until February 2014.

The West Ham striker proposed to Mucklow at the beginning of November while they were on a romantic holiday in Rome for the reality TV star's birthday.

Carroll has scored two goals in six games for Sam Allardyce's side since coming back from an ankle injury in November.

The player has recently revealed he is desperate to make up for lost time over the busy Christmas period.

The 25-year-old missed the first three months of the Premier League season through injury

Speaking to West Ham's official website, Carroll said: 'It's like my pre-season now, just coming back. It's my first few games, so I'm raring to go. I'm still feeling good and feeling fresh.

'It feels great for me. It's very important for me to come back from injury and stay injury free. All the work I'm doing with the medical staff and the treatment team is keeping me toned and fully fit, so it's obviously great for me to get another 90 minutes.

'Even though I haven't been playing games at the start of the season, I've still been working very, very hard getting myself fit. It's probably even more strenuous and harder work being injured and working yourself back up than it is playing.'

The former Newcastle and Liverpool striker said he was 'raring to go' ahead of the festive fixtures
