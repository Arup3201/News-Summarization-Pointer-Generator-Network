Actor Craig Fairbrass has told of his torment over his ailing mother who disappeared while shopping at a supermarket.

The former EastEnders star fears for the safety of frail dementia sufferer Maureen Fairbrass, 72, who was last seen near her home on Tuesday.

As police brought in tracker dogs and a helicopter search team, Craig said: 'I am frightened to death. She has no clue who she is, where she is or even what her name is. It is so sad.'

'Frightened to death': Craig Fairbrass with his dementia-sufferer mother Maureen, who has gone missing. Family and friends she may have returned to the area where she was brought up in London's East End.

He cancelled filming Hijacked with British actor Vinnie Jones 
and booked a last-minute flight home from Singapore.

Mrs
Fairbrass had been shopping with her husband Jack in Waitrose in 
Bromley, Kent, when CCTV filmed her wandering off at 5.30pm.

She is described as being about 5ft 8in tall with blonde shoulder length hair and of medium build.

Concern: Craig, seen here last year with his wife, Elke Kellick, has jetted back from filming Hijacked with Vinnie Jones in Singapore after his mother went missing

When she went missing she was wearing a 
three-quarter length black leather jacket, a black polo shirt, blue 
jeans and black shoes.

Mrs Fairbrass grew up in the East End of London so friends suspect she may have gone there. Family members have been putting up 
posters in the area.

Craig, 47, shot to fame on 
British TV screens as Gary 'Technique' Pagnall in the hit ITV drama London's
Burning in the early 90s.

Screen star: Fairbrass starred as Dan Sullivan in EastEnders from 1999 
and 2001 and appeared in storylines including having an affair with 
Bianca Jackson, played by actress Patsy Palmer

He went on to star alongside 
Sylvester Stallone in the 1993 Hollywood blockbuster Cliffhanger playing
mercenary Delmar before joining EastEnders in 1999 as Dan Sullivan.

During his time in the BBC soap, 
Craig was involved in many highly-publicised storylines, including 
having an affair with Bianca Jackson at the same time as having a 
relationship with her mother Carol.

He later left EastEnders in 2001.

His voice can currently be heard on 
blockbuster computer game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 playing the 
part of Sergeant Wallcroft.

Since his mother disappeared, dog rescue teams have been searching parks and local woods with daily flights by the helicopter air support unit.

A Bromley police spokesman said: 'We are very worried for the welfare of Mrs Fairbrass.'
