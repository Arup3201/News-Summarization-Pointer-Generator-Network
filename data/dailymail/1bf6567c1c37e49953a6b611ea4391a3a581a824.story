If you didn’t get a chance to soak up yesterday’s glorious sunshine, don’t worry – the warm weather is staying for a bit longer.

Thousands flocked to beaches, parks and gardens as temperatures hit 20C in London and  the South.

And that delightful taste of summer is setting the tone for the week ahead. Wednesday and Thursday are expected to be the best days in the South, although rain could threaten just in time for the weekend, when temperatures could drop again.

The summery weather is due to an area 
of high pressure over the UK, which meant some regions were warmer 
yesterday than Cyprus, Majorca and Portugal.

The Met Office says temperatures this week will stay higher in the south than the usual average of 12C for this time of year.

However, the North won’t be as lucky, with more cloud and the chance of some showers.

A
 spokesman for Meteogroup said: ‘The weather is looking pretty good 
until Friday. The next few days, especially in the South, will continue 
to be reasonable. Wednesday should be a very nice day.’

Yesterday’s
 fine weather followed the previous warm weekend, when the highest 
temperature of the year so far of 20.5C was recorded in Gravesend, Kent.

One of the many enjoying 
the sunshine yesterday was Debbie Jones, 39, from Ringwood in  
Hampshire, who was on Bournemouth beach with her husband, Mark, 41, and 
their daughter  Lily, four.

She
 said: ‘I have to keep reminding myself that it is March and just a few 
weeks ago we had torrential rain.

'My daughter is having such a lovely 
time building sandcastles and paddling in the sea. It almost feels like 
summer.’

However, the Met 
Office sounded a warning, saying yesterday was probably the last day of 
‘unbroken sunshine’ for some time, especially for those in the West and 
North.

Forecaster Emma Sharples said: ‘Things are going to be 
changeable, becoming more unsettled and cooler. Monday looks quite a  
cloudy day with bits and pieces of rain and drizzle in the West  and 
North.

‘There will be persistent rain but some brighter spells developing in the South East by the afternoon.

‘Tuesday
 and Wednesday look much the same with a fair bit of cloudy rain in the 
North of England and Scotland.

Lambing season has begun at Hadlow College.  Forecasters at the Met Office have predicted that the spring sunshine will remain for the rest of this month

Although next week temperatures will drop slightly, they are set to remain above the usual average of 12C, remaining dry in many places across the UK

Heading into April, temperatures are expected to be around average for the time of year

Southern and eastern parts of England will see some bright and sunny spells, but there will be more in the way of cloud around, particularly in the west

Forecasters at the Met Office were unable to predict as far ahead as this summer, but said yesterday's temperatures will continue across the region

Lambing season is typically in April, but it seems to have come early this year - a sure sign that Spring has definitely sprung

Other early predictions for the summer say it could even beat July 2006, the warmest month on record over much of the UK, when temperatures regularly topped 28C

'The weather is quite changeable next week.

We won’t have unbroken blue skies unfortunately. Next week we’ll return 
to more average temperatures.’

However, scientists in Germany are predicting that Britain could be in for a sizzling summer.

Academics
 at Justus Liebig University in Giessen said we could benefit from an 
unusual weather pattern, which happens when waters on the Pacific 
equator become unusually warm.

Scotland and northern England will experience rain on Wednesday, although it will be drier elsewhere with some brighter spells.

The highest temperature recorded for the UK so far this year was 20.5C in Gravesend, Kent, last Sunday.

Mild temperatures have also meant that British asparagus has gone on sale at supermarkets three weeks earlier than last year.

A
 mild winter and growing hardy varieties under tunnels have helped bring
 the crop onto shelves much earlier, Marks & Spencer said.

The
 season traditionally runs from late March and early April and this 
year's introduction matches the earliest ever UK asparagus in 2012.
