This is the moment a group of teens in school uniform celebrated the end of their time at school - with a drink down the local pub.

The youths were spotted this afternoon in their blazers and ties at the Cheshire Midland Pub in Hale, Cheshire.

In high spirits, the crowd of boys trooped down to the establishment on Friday afternoon, and sat outside the pub with schoolbags at their feet.

Day out: The pupils are thought to have just left their leavers' day celebrations at Altrincham Grammar School

The teenagers are thought to be pupils from the nearby Altrincham Grammar School, whose pupils sport green blazers.

Altrincham's year 13 students - who will be facing A-level exams from this month - had their leavers' event today at school.

The selective academy school is one of the best-performing in Britain, and came in the top 30 for A-level results this year, ahead of public schools such as Eton College, Westminster and St Paul's.

Leavers' day hijinks have raised eyebrows elsewhere across the country this week.

At another boys' grammar school - Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire - the headteacher was forced to apologise after he tweeted a photograph of students who had 'blacked up' for fancy dress.

Year 11 pupils - three white and one mixed-race - had come to school dressed as the Jamaican bobsleigh team in a tribute to the film Cool Runnings.

After an outcry, head Stephen Lehec removed the picture and said: 'It was not the intention of either the students or the school to cause offence and the school unreservedly apologises for any offence that was caused.

'The school accepts that it exercised poor judgement in not acting swiftly when it saw the boys concerned and it has taken steps to ensure that this does not happen at future school events.'

MailOnline contacted the Cheshire Midland Pub, where a member of staff said that everybody's ID had been checked before they were served and that they had caused 'no trouble'.

Altrincham Grammar School was not available for comment.
