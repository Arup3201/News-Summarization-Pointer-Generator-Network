Tottenham want to hijack Arsenal’s move for Queens Park Rangers striker Loic Remy.

Spurs’ chief talent-spotter Ian Broomfield, who played a key role in bringing Remy to Loftus Road, is a long term admirer of the France international and has recommended the club launch a move.

QPR boss Harry Redknapp revealed in May that Remy, 27, has an £8million release fee in his contract.

But the prospect of a regular starting role at White Hart Lane could lead to a change of heart.

Remy impressed during a loan spell at Newcastle last season, where he scored 14 goals in 24 starts for the Magpies.

Alan Pardew is keen on keeping Remy, but the forward’s determination to resume his Champions League career has proved a major stumbling block.
