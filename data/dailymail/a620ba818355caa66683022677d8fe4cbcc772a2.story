A Tennessee couple were picking up a breakfast snack from their local McDonald's - but were instead served a paper bag brimming with cash.

Greg and Stacye Terry, of Hermitage, were accidentally handed thousands of dollars, which were supposed to be deposited in the bank but somehow ended up in the drive-through window.

The costly mistake was quickly discovered, and the Terrys did the right thing by returning their unexpected windfall without a moment's hesitation.

Honest customers: Greg and Stacye Terry ended up returning the small fortune after discovering the error

The incident happened at the fast-food eatery on Lebanon Road in Hermitage.

On a recent morning, Stacye and Greg pulled up in their truck next to the drive-through window and placed their usual breakfast order.

After being handed a standard McDonald's bag containing what they thought to be their food, the Terrys drove off.

‘My husband opened the bag and discovered the money inside,’ Stacye Terry told NewsChannel5. ‘He said, “You are not going to believe this.” Sure enough, it was their bank deposit money.’

When a McDonald’s employee discovered to her horror that she had accidentally handed the customers a stack of banknotes neatly wrapped in plastic that were supposed to be deposited in the bank, she was able to quickly reach the Terrys in their home.

‘The second that he said it was their deposit, my first thing was let's get in the truck and take it back,’ said Stacye. ‘There is no other way to have it.  I couldn't live with myself.’

Costly snafu: The clerk who handed the Terrys their pricey order quickly realized her mistake and tracked them down

Phil Gray, who owns the branch on Lebanon Road, released a statement thanking his patrons for their actions. 

‘We are looking in to why this mistake happened, but what is most important to us is knowing that we are part a community with the values that were evidenced by this person's actions,’ the statement read.

The Terrys expressed hope that no one on the eatery's staff would be fired over this snafu.

Greg Terry, who works as a land surveyor, and his wife said they plan to continue patronizing the fast-food joint, but they do not expect to get another order of greenbacks in their lifetime.
