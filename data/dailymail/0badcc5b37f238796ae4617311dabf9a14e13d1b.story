Staying put: Prince Harry should carry on fighting in Afghanistan despite the attack on Camp Bastion, defence experts believe

Prince Harry should carry on fighting in Afghanistan, defence experts said today despite the royal being caught 'just 400 yards' from an fierce battle when Taliban fighters armed with rocket-propelled grenades burst into Camp Bastion.

Former officers warned that withdrawing Harry from his military role would be 'playing into the hands of the Taliban', granting the opposition a morale-boosting propaganda victory.

Concerns have heightened over the Prince's deployment since Friday night's attack, in which two US Marines were killed and four British airmen were seriously wounded.

The intense three-hour fire-fight 
was followed by the killing of two British soldiers by a man wearing 
Afghan police uniform in a separate incident.

The soldiers, from 3rd Battalion The 
Yorkshire Regiment, were killed at a checkpoint in the south of Nahr-e 
Saraj district in Helmand province.

Harry, an Army captain, is based at Camp Bastion for his second tour of duty, due to last four months.

US officials said the attack on Camp 
Bastion was by heavily-armed insurgents and involved a range of 
weaponry, including mortars, rockets or rocket-propelled grenades, as 
well as small arms fire.

The Taliban said it carried out the 
attack because Harry was on the base, and also as revenge for an 
internet video that mocks the Prophet Muhammad.

Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi 
said: 'We attacked that base because Prince Harry was also on it and so 
they can know our anger.'

He added: 'Thousands more suicide attackers are ready to give up their lives for the sake of the Prophet.'

Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart, a former
commander of British troops in Bosnia, dismissed suggestions that Harry
should be withdrawn because of the attack.

'To hell with them,' he said. 'Harry wants to go there and our soldiers want him there. He should stay.'

But Col Stewart stressed that the security considerations regarding the deployment of the Prince were flexible.

'These things aren't set in concrete,' he said. 'If circumstances really change then we'll make different judgments.'

Col Steward added: 'Capturing, killing or hurting Prince Harry would be a huge propaganda coup for the Taliban.'

Major Charles Heyman, a former 
infantry officer and editor of The Armed Forces of the United Kingdom 
publication, warned against the dangers of 'playing into the hands of 
the Taliban'.

He said: 'On balance it is a difficult equation but I think he should be kept there.

'If we take him away the Taliban will crow that they have just scored a major victory.

'The second point is it would affect 
the morale of the troops on the ground if Prince Harry was taken out 
just because there was a threat.'

Maj Heyman added that it was not the first time Camp Bastion had been targeted.

'The Taliban have been doing these 
things for five years now,' he said. 'Bastion is a huge complex. It is 
really a military city.

'This is one of those pinprick attacks that went right as they killed two US Marines. But in most of them no one gets hurt.'

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said:
'The threat to all our service personnel is continually assessed and 
all measures taken to mitigate it.

'As we stated last week, the 
deployment of Captain Wales has been long planned and the threat to him 
and others around him thoroughly assessed.

'We stated that any risk posed by his
deployment, based on the capability, opportunity and intent of the 
insurgency, is continually reviewed.'

The Prince last night told his commanding officers he was 'staying put'.

He insisted to superiors that he was ‘fine’ and was determined to carry out his duties as an Apache helicopter pilot.

Military
sources told The Mail on Sunday the attack must have been planned days,
if not weeks in advance in order to gain access to the heavily fortifed
base and get to ‘within 400 yards’ of Harry.

The
insurgents are believed to have studied Camp Bastion beforehand and 
passed unnoticed through vehicle checkpoints before recovering a cache 
of weapons hidden in the desert.

At about 10pm local time on Friday, 16
fighters dug beneath a perimeter fence on the camp’s eastern side and 
ran towards the airfield, where they were challenged by US Marines.

They
fired rocket-propelled grenades and rifles, killing the two Marines and
destroying aircraft including Harrier jets and Cobra helicopters. At 
this stage 50 UK and US personnel, including airmen from the RAF 
Regiment’s Force Protection Wing, were scrambled to the airfield.

The
gun battle continued for three hours with the Taliban desperate to 
reach Harry’s accommodation and a British airstrip where his Apache 
helicopter was standing idle. The Prince was rushed to safety as the 
Taliban closed in.

The attacks on Camp Bastion reminded the world of the dangerous environment Prince Harry will be operating in

According
to Nato coalition chiefs, 15 Taliban were shot dead. The remaining 
insurgent was wounded and taken to hospital at Camp Bastion where he 
remains under armed guard.

Last night he was at the centre of a 
probe into how the enemy breached such tight security and came so close 
to attacking Harry just a week into his deployment. The four British 
casualties were also treated for gunshot wounds.

A military source said: ‘This was a very well planned and executed attack. The logistics involved in order to get inside a base with heavy weapons takes a lot of working out. So this is not something they just dreamed up in the space of a few hours.

‘From our point of view we do not know
they are enemy until they take hostile action. They knew that and took 
precautions, reaching the fence surrounding Camp Bastion with their 
weapons concealed.

‘The 
investigation into the attack will look at whether the insurgents 
belonged to the Afghan National Army. But if they were ANA they would 
probably have chosen a different method of entry to Camp Bastion.

‘When the attack began Harry was with the other Apache crew members. He was not training, this was during his down-time.

‘He
was accompanied by protection officers. Harry was carrying a loaded 
weapon, so was every member of personnel at Camp Bastion. This is a new 
security procedure adopted earlier this year. A number of incidents led 
us to raise the security profile.

‘He was not in danger and he resumed his training on Saturday as planned. He is fine and will not be going anywhere.

‘All the US aircraft were aligned along the eastern side of the runway, in the area where the Taliban force chose to enter the base. Many of these were destroyed in the attack, including transport and attack helicopters. The gunmen then moved towards the hangars and passenger handling areas on the western side of the runway.

‘The British aircraft and helicopters 
are stored on a separate flight line with its own perimeter. Here the 
enemy were intercepted by RAF Regiment personnel. They killed plenty of 
the gunmen but casualties were sustained.’

Harry
met with colleagues from 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army  Air Corps after
the engagement. He is expected to conduct his first operational 
missions as an Apache pilot this week.

The mood at Camp Bastion was said to 
be ‘doubly sombre’ last night in the aftermath of the attack on the base
and the latest British fatality of the campaign.

A soldier from 1st Battalion, the Grenadier Guards, was killed on Friday by a roadside bomb in Nahr-e Saraj in Helmand.

Harry is due to remain at Camp Bastion until January. The base is located in a remote desert area north-west of Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand. It is the hub for all British operations in the province and, along with Camp Leatherneck, houses thousands of combat troops and Marines, including Danish and Estonian forces.

Afghanistan’s southern region has been a hotbed of the insurgency and attacks against foreign forces happen daily. Helmand remains an active battlefield between insurgents and Nato forces and for years has been the site of some of the war’s bloodiest engagements.

Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart, a former commander of British troops in Bosnia, said he did not think the Prince should be pulled out of Afghanistan because of the attack.

‘To hell with them,’ he said. ‘Harry wants to go there and our soldiers want him there. He should stay.’

The Ministry of Defence insisted Harry was never in danger and claimed the attack was thwarted 1,000 yards from his accommodation. The MoD said: ‘The threat to all our service personnel is continually assessed and all measures taken to mitigate it.

‘As we stated last week, the deployment of Captain Wales has been long planned and the threat to him and others around him thoroughly assessed.’

Meanwhile, the Afghan government has indefinitely blocked YouTube to prevent its citizens seeing a clip of the controversial US-made film, Innocence Of Muslims.
