It was a case that echoed another famous lawsuit against McDonald's 20 years ago, but investigators are claiming this one's a phony.

Selena Edwards, 38, of Victorville claimed that an unsecured lid on a cup of piping hot McDonald's coffee led to a spill that burned her right hand, providing photos to bolster a case in which she was seeking $10,000.

But  state officials say  her evidence was falsified, and the San Bernardino County district attorney has slapped Edwards with 21 felony counts of insurance fraud and workers' compensation fraud.

Caution hot: Selena Edwards, 38, claimed she received second-degree burns after spilling hot coffee on her hand, but investigators are saying her case is fraudulent

'We discovered that some of the photos were from a hospital website,' the state's Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones told the Los Angeles Times. 

'We contacted her medical provider and discovered she hadn’t received any medical treatment.'

According to Jones, Edwards's insurance company had doubts about  her injuries, leading them to refer her claims to state investigators.

Edwards originally claimed that she visited a McDonald's in Fontana on January 28, 2013, getting coffee from the drive-through window.

The lid on the coffee was not secure, and spilled on her hand, causing second-degree burns, in the version of events now disputed by investigators.

'By copying legitimate burn photos from the Internet, Edwards attempted to make a profit from another person’s pain and suffering and for this she will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,' said Jones.

Settlements: McDonald's has settled numerous coffee burn cases in the past according to the Wall Street Journal, but fought Stella Liebeck after she received severe third-degree burns that disabled her

In 1994, a jury awarded an 81-year-old former department store clerk Stella Liebeck $2.9million after hot coffee spilled into her lap, causing third-degree burns.  

In a case that has been mocked and misunderstood for years, The Wall Street Journal reported that McDonald's refused to cover Liebeck's hospital fees, only offering her $800. 

It is not clear if Liebeck's case prompted the change, but the New York Times reports that a later handbook for McDonald's advised to keep coffee 10 degrees cooler than before.
