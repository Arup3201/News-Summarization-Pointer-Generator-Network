Veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis has been charged with one count of indecent assault.

Former BBC presenter Travis, 68, was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault in February but jurors at London's Southwark Crown Court were unable to reach verdicts on two charges.

He has now been charged with one further count of indecent assault on a woman in January 1995, and is due to appear on bail at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday April 24, Scotland Yard said.

Back in court: DJ Dave Lee Travis has been charged with one count of indecent assault just two months after he was cleared of 12 counts of the same offence

Travis - real name David Patrick Griffin - last month said the 'nightmare is continuing' after being told he would be charged with the further count of indecent assault.

The new charge relates to an alleged assault on a young woman when Travis appeared on The Mrs Merton Show on the BBC in 1995.

The Crown Prosecution Service has already said the DJ will be retried over two allegations on which the jury failed to agree in his earlier trial.

One alleges that Travis grabbed the breasts of a national newspaper reporter, 'sizing them up like a fruit'.

He is said to have carried out the attack at his home in 2008 after offering to take saucy photos of the reporter while his wife slept upstairs.

In the other allegation, Travis is said to have pounced on a pantomime stage-hand in his dressing room while he was playing Aladdin's evil uncle Abanazar in the early 1009s.

He is said to have only pulled away when he was interrupted by TV comedy duo the Chuckle Brothers.

Travis was arrested in 2012 by police officers from Operation Yewtree, the investigation into historic sex crimes sparked by the death of Jimmy Savile.

The investigation has already cost £2.7million, of which £490,000 has been paid to the 30-strong detective team.

The DJ’s original six-week trial is 
estimated to have cost around £300,000, while the second trial may cost 
another £150,000.

Travis had to sell his £1million house in Mentmore, 
Buckinghamshire, to pay for his legal fees for the first trial.

Tonight
 a Metropolitan Police Service spokesman said: 'David Patrick Griffin, 
of Aylesbury, has today, Tuesday, 15 April, been charged with one count 
of indecent assault on a woman over 16 years of age in January 1995.

'He is due to appear on bail at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday, 24 April.'
