Tragic: Devon schoolgirl Izzy Dix was found dead by her mother at her home in Brixham on Tuesday

A girl of 14 said to have been the target of bullies has been found dead.

The body of Izzy Dix was discovered at home by her devastated mother.

On a memorial page set up in her memory on Facebook, some have suggested the schoolgirl had been bullied before she took her own life.

One of the 3,000 followers on the page wrote: 'I hope the bullies who brought this about are found and brought to justice.

My thoughts and prayers go out to Izzy’s family and friends. R.I.P little one.'

He added: 'Such a beautiful young girl, with everything to live for, so terrible that Izzy felt so alone and desperate to end her short life.'

Another added: ‘I hope the scum that made her do this feel guilty and ashamed.

'It’s just a shame that it’s taken her death for people to say nice things about her.

'My thoughts are with her family at this most tragic of times.

'No parent should have to bury their child. RIP Izzy. You’re safe now xxx.’

The schoolgirl, from Brixham, Devon, posted a picture on her own Facebook page last month with the cryptic message: 'Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened.’

News of her death was broken to her classmates in assemblies at Brixham Community College on Wednesday morning, with counselling services offered to traumatised pupils.

Police and paramedics were called to Izzy’s home on Tuesday night where they confirmed she was dead.
