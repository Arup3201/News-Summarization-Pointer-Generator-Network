Nick Clegg today tore into coalition plans to allow nurseries to look after more children, warning it will have no impact on cutting costs for parents.

He said any adult would struggle to care for six two-year-olds at once, as he lifted the lid on a long-running government row about the risks to child safety.

Tory minister Elizabeth Truss launched a strong defence of her plans in the Commons, but Labour said the chaotic policy put child safety at risk.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg could block flagship Tory childcare reforms

The Deputy Prime Minister has horrified 
Tory colleagues by threatening to block flagship Government reforms of 
childcare just weeks before they are due to be implemented.

Mr Clegg said parents groups, experts and childcare providers had warned the reforms - championed by Tory education minister Elizabeth Truss - would not work in an official consultation.

He said: 'A lot of people basically got back in the consultation and said this isn't going to work, particularly for very small children, it isn't necessarily going to be passed on in terms of cost savings to parents.'

Miss Truss has designed radical 
reform of the system to improve the quality of staff, while reducing 
costs by lowering the stipulated adult/child ratios.

She wants to raise the qualifications
required of nursery staff and, in return, allow the establishments to 
increase ratios – for instance four rather than three 
under-two-year-olds per adult, and six toddlers rather than four.

Childminders will be able to have two babies in their care rather than one and four under-fives rather than three.

But Mr Clegg said on his weekly radio phone-in: 'Having six under-twos instead of four is quite a challenge for the adult.

'I think four is already quite a handful, just imagine if they go up to six. This is not a great ideological thing, this is just about getting it right for parents up and down the country,' he told LBC 97.3.

'When the last government changed the so-called ratios and allowed an adult to look after more young children, they did it for three and four-year-olds, it had almost no effect in reducing the cost for parents whatsoever.

'So you do need to be led by the evidence and that is what I will continue to do in the debate."

'In a nutshell this debate is about: can you raise quality and quantity at the same time. We have got to get the balance right. We owe it to parents who want quality childcare.'

He said the behind-the-scenes row had been going on 'for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks'.

And he told LBC host Nick Ferrari: 'I will challenge you to spend a morning looking after six two-year-olds - I think you will find it quite a challenge.'

Ratio reform: Education minister Elizabeth Truss has championed changes to the number of children nurseries can look after

Tory ministers want to relax the rules on carer-to-child ratios, to bring them more in line with other European countries

Mr Clegg insisted the row will not 
affected the rest of the government's wide-ranging childcare package 
which also includes £1,200 tax breaks on childcare for working parents.

In the Commons today, Miss Truss insisted the reforms would help to cut costs for parents while allowing childcare staff to be paid more.

'The current system of childcare is not working for parents,' she told MPs. 

'Too many parents in the UK are 
struggling to juggle their work and childcare arrangements. Families in 
England pay some of the highest costs in the world - 27 per cent of 
their income goes on costs, compared to 11% in countries like France.'

She
said that in Ireland and Germany, the ratio for two-year-olds was six 
to one, in France each member of staff could look after eight 
youngsters, while in Denmark and in Sweden there were ''no national 
staff ratios at all'.

Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said ratios should not be relaxed because it will not cut costs

'Our proposals will allow nurseries who hire high-quality staff to able to exercise professional judgment. It is exactly the same concept that we have used in academies, giving high-quality institutions the autonomy to make decisions for themselves and to be able to exercise professional judgment.

'These ratios are not compulsory. This is about professionals in the childcare sector being able to exercise their judgment and being able to deliver an affordable, high-quality service to parents.'

But Labour's shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said the row was proof of a government in chaos.

Writing for MailOnline he said: 'All this gives the impression of a Government that runs on the basis of chaos and confusion.

This creates real fear amongst parents who need some reassurance on the quality and affordability of childcare.

'The truth is this is a Government with no plan to help hard working families with the costs of childcare, which have spiralled under this Government.

'It’s not just the experts of course, as any parent will tell you, young children are demanding and they need lots of attention, so while a childminder can have the very best qualifications, they still only have one pair of hands.

'Labour have been campaigning on this issue for months, warning that the changes would risk the quality of care and even child safety.'

In
January Miss Truss unveiled a major overhaul of the rules on who can 
look after children, the qualifications they need and the ratios of 
staff to children with the aim of having fewer, better-qualified staff.

But government advisor, Professor Helen Penn, said: 'The figures she gives seem to me to be rather grotesque.'

Professor
Penn, an expert in early childhood, co-wrote a report for the 
government on the reforms with Professor Eva Lloyd last year.

However,
a leaked copy revealed it warned allowing childminders and nursery 
workers to care for more children would lead to a 'deterioration' of the
quality of care.

In an interview with the Daily Mail last month, Miss Truss said too many childcare settings were ‘chaotic’ with children ‘running around’ and ‘no sense of purpose’.

A spokesman said: 'Nick remains to be persuaded that this is the right thing to do for very young children'

But in government meetings over recent days, Mr Clegg has made clear he can no longer support the reforms of ratios.

‘The
question that needs to be answered is will this drive down costs,’ said
a Lib Dem source. ‘If it doesn’t then that defeats the object of doing 
it.’

Another Whitehall source said the Lib Dems appeared to have been ‘spooked’ by the negative reaction of some childcare providers. The Prime Minister will now have to begin ‘horse-trading’ with the Lib Dems.

A
spokesman for the Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘The delivery of good 
quality, affordable childcare is one of Nick Clegg’s biggest priorities.

Nick remains to be persuaded that this is the right thing to do for very young children.

‘Or, crucially, to be persuaded that this would actually help families with high childcare costs.’

In one survey, conducted by the National Children’s Bureau, out of 341 staff interviewed, 95 per cent said they were concerned about the policy.

‘The Government’s own adviser on childcare, Professor Cathy Nutbrown, said the ratio plans ‘make no sense at all’.

Neil Leitch, Chief Executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: 'Thousands of parents and practitioners, as well as some of the country's leading early years academics, are against these changes, which will lower the overall quality of childcare in this country.

'We trust the Deputy Prime Minister will listen to what parents and the sector have to say about these proposals, which we believe are a huge mistake.'

The Department for Education refused to comment.
