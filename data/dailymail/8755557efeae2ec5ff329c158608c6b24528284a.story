Gordon Ramsay was last night accused of ‘cooking up a lie’ when it was revealed that contestants on his US version of MasterChef have been secretly receiving cooking lessons.

The covert coaching was revealed on a blog by a runner-up contestant on the hit TV show who said there had been ‘baking component classes including how to make pastry cream, sponge cake, cobbler, shortbread and pie crusts, etc’.

One insider added: ‘The entire show is not at all how it seems. Each home cook is given professional training before the challenges to ensure they can cook something decent when they start recording.

‘They don’t want the contestants talking about it because people are under the impression that the challenges are totally spontaneous, but  this is absolutely untrue. They are cooking up a lie.’ 

Last night a producer of the programme told The Mail on Sunday: ‘MasterChef US has never made any secret of the practice where prior to certain specialist challenges contestants have been given access to training and relevant reference materials. We have discussed this openly and publicly.’

Andrew Kojima, a 2012 MasterChef UK finalist, denied lessons had been given to contestants in the British version. He said: ‘We were never given any coaching at all.’
