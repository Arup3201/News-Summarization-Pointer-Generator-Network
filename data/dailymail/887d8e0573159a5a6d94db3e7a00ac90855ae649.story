A now-former teacher at a Texas high school was arrested this week after authorities say she had a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student and then asking others to lie to the police about the alleged misconduct.

In at least one case, the unidentified student told authorities that he and 26-year-old Kelly Lynn Thompson had sexual contact in her car is it was parked in front of the boy's parents' home.

According to court documents, the Cypress Lakes High School's Independent School District Police received a call from a witness who said Thompson had been having a relationship with a student.

The witness told the ISD police that Thompson had said she and the boy were in love.

After authorities began questioning Thompson about the relationship, investigators say there's text message evidence that shows she pleaded with some of her close friends to deny that they knew anything about the alleged relationship.

The teen involved in the alleged relationship was interviewed by police and admitted to having a sexual relationship with his teacher - and he told them about the time in front of his parents' house.

'Cypress-Fairbanks ISD is very concerned about the serious nature of
 the allegations against a former Cy Lakes teacher,' the school district said in a written statement. 'Inappropriate 
behavior or misconduct will not be tolerated by any staff member. The 
safety of our students is always our highest priority, and we will 
continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement.'

Parents at the school aren't rushing to judgment, with one parent telling ABC13.com, 'I think it could be both ways. It could be a student
 making something up, or it could be you know, wrong that the teacher is
 having an inappropriate relationship with a student.'

Thompson was booked on charges of having an inappropriate relationship with a minor and tampering with witness.

She's due back in court on Thursday.
