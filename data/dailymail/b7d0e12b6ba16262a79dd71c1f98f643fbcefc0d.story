Motown legend Smokey Robinson has listed his 9,075-square-foot California mansion for a discounted price of $7.99 million - hoping for a 'third time lucky' after previous attempts to sell the property failed.

The white-washed, six-bedroom property on the star-studded Chatsworth estate includes a wine cellar, 'man cave', movie theater with reclining leather seats, and a 2,000-square-foot guest house.

It first hit the market in 2005 for a cool $10.5 million and was lowered to $10 million in 2007 with no success.  

All yours: Motown music legend Smokey Robinson has listed his 9,075-square-foot California mansion for a discounted price of $7.99 million

Unique features: The six-bedroom property on the star-studded Chatsworth estate includes a wine cellar, movie theater with reclining leather seats and a 'man cave'

Third time lucky: It first hit the market in 2005 for a cool $10.5 million and was lowered to $10 million in 2007 with no success

Music legend: Robinson (pictured left, in the Seventies and right in October 2014) has been behind some of the greatest records of the past half-century, writing and producing songs for artists including the Supremes and Marvin Gaye

Robinson, 74, purchased the three-storey home for $2.7 million in 2002.

His second wife, Frances, was in charge of interior design and it took a year to get the Nineties build up to scratch.

She designed a 'men's room' for Robinson and his friends to hang out in, decking it out with a pool table, plasma TV and trophy cabinet.

A large crystal chandelier in the  domed hallway and cherrywood flooring in place of marble were among her other touches.

The designer told SF Gate the first time she and her husband tried to sell the property in 2005 that it was 'too much house' and they were looking to downsize.

Indeed, one of the redundant bedrooms was used as a storage room for Robinson's golf gear.

Fred Calloway of Calloway Real Estate holds the current listing.

During his time at the Chatsworth property, Robinson released numerous albums including the collection of standards Timeless Love and most recently Smokey & Friends - an album of duets, including ones with Elton John, John Legend and Jessie J.

The R&B star, who was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, founded The Miracles while he was still in high school.

Their single Shop Around became Motown’s first number one hit on the R&B singles chart.

He announced his retirement from the stage in 1972 so he could concentrate on running Motown Records as  vice president.

However, he returned to the music industry the following year as a solo artist, releasing hits such as Cruisin', Being With You  and Just to See Her.

In 1987, he was inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and awarded an individual star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Along with the Miracles, Robinson has been behind some of the greatest records of the past half-century, writing and producing songs for artists including the Supremes and Marvin Gaye.
