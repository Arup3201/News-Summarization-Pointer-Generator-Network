Oscar Pistorius threw up in the dock again on Thursday after horrific images of his girlfriend's body were shown in court.

Gasps were heard throughout the Pretoria courtroom when close-up pictures were briefly displayed, apparently by accident, on a computer screen by his defence team.

They showed Reeva Steenkamp's skull, body and her injuries after she was shot dead by the Paralympian at his home.

Pistorius began violently retching at the sight of his girlfriend's corpse before being handed a green bucket which he vomited into repeatedly.

Earlier, a photograph of Pistorius's 
blood-stained prosthetic legs was used by his chief defense lawyer in a 
bid to show that the athlete was wearing them, as he says, when he broke
 down the toilet door with a cricket bat.

The
 image, showing the prosthetic limbs with white socks and stained with 
Reeva Steenkamp's blood up to the knee, was displayed by lawyer Barry 
Roux on a TV monitor at Pistorius's murder trial.

The
 chief defence lawyer at Oscar Pistorius's murder trial today 
highlighted alleged missteps by police and questioned their treatment of
 key evidence during the investigation.

Lawyer
 Barry Roux grilled a police forensics expert for a second day, 
challenging his analysis of a bullet-marked toilet door that was removed
 from Pistorius's bathroom after he shot Reeva Steenkamp.

In
 an aggressive start to his cross-examination, Mr Roux questioned 
whether Colonel Johannes Vermeulen even had the right qualifications to 
examine marks on the door that offer crucial evidence to what happened 
the moment the model was killed.

He also forced Col Vermeulen to admit that police may have contaminated the crime scene during their investigation.

Mr Roux asked what happened to some fragments from the door that went missing after police investigators took possession of it.

Col Vermeulen said he asked about the missing splinters, but repeatedly said he 'couldn't remember' which colleague he spoke to.

The forensics analyst also conceded that footprints that appeared to be from police 
boots were seen in evidence photos, but later rubbed off.

Mr
 Roux argued they could have been made by Pistorius's prosthetic legs - 
which could have backed up a crucial argument by the sprinter that he 
was wearing them when he smashed down the door.

Col Vermeulen earlier argued Pistorius would have been on his stumps both 
when he fired the shots that killed Miss Steenkamp and when he broke 
down the door.

The lawyer also noted that Col Vermeulen had not read Pistorius's version of events on the night of the killing until after he had completed his forensic study of the door and was therefore leaning toward the prosecution's version of what happened.

Key moment: The re-enactment is critical to the case as it tests the athlete's assertions about exactly what happened on the night he killed Miss Steenkamp in his bathroom on Valentine's Day last year

Pistorius
 has said he shot Miss Steenkamp by mistake through the door, fearing 
there was a dangerous intruder in the house. The prosecution says he 
intentionally killed her after an argument.

Yesterday,
 Col Vermeulen argued that Pistorius was on his stumps at the time he 
broke down the door with the cricket bat, contradicting the 
Paralympian's assertion that he was wearing his prosthetic legs.

The issue is critical to the case as 
it tests the athlete's assertions about exactly what happened on the 
night he killed Miss Steenkamp in his bathroom on Valentine's Day last 
year.

Pistorius 
says he fearfully approached the bathroom on his stumps and shot Miss 
Steenkamp by mistake while believing she was an intruder.

According
 to his account, he then put on his prostheses and tried to kick down 
the locked toilet door before hitting it with the bat after realising 
what he had done.

However, Col Vermeulen said the bat 
was used to hit the door from a low position and knelt and swung 
Pistorius's cricket bat to demonstrate his 
point.

Analysis: The height at which the bat struck the door is measured in court in an attempt by the prosecution to determine whether Pistorius was on his prosthetic legs at the time

He also believed Pistorius was on his stumps
 when he fired through the toilet door, based on the angle of the bullet
 marks in the door, which was on display in the courtroom alongside a 
recreation of the cubicle.

He told the court: 'The
 marks on the door are actually consistent with him not having his legs 
on and I suspect they must be similar to the height that he was when he 
fired the shots.'

And in a dramatic climbdown, lead prosecutor Gerrie Nel also said that it was no longer part of the state's case that Pistorius was wearing his prosthetics at the time.

That
 mistaken claim by prosecutors in the early part of the investigation 
was used by them to argue there was premeditation in the killing.

They asserted that by taking the time to put on his legs before going to the bathroom, Pistorius showed premeditation before killing the 29-year-old model.

Evidence: The bullet holes and shattered wood where Pistorius struck the door are clearly seen here

Clues: Based on the angle and height of the four bullet holes seen here, Pistorius fired his gun on his stumps, according to forensic analyst Colonel Johannes Vermeulen

Measurements: The court is shown a picture which Col Vermeulen took at the time of his initial investigation a few weeks after Miss Steenkamp was shot on Valentine's Day last year

Detail: This image shows where the bat broke through the door in the weakest part of the panel

Former South African cricketer Herschelle Gibbs, right, has claimed the bat Oscar Pistorius used to smash down the toilet door after shooting Reeva Steenkamp had been signed by him.

Police Colonel Johannes Vermeulen presented the bat as a key piece of evidence about exactly what happened on the night Miss Steenkamp died.

Shortly after the bat was shown on TV, Gibbs - @hershybru on Twitter - posted: 'Just saw my signature on the bat used by the accused in oscar trial... lol #neveradullmoment'

The prosecution now says Pistorius first
 hit the door with a bat in an effort to get to Miss Steenkamp, then 
shot through the door.

But 
in another crucial endorsement of the defence's case, Col Vermeulen 
testified that the athlete broke down the door only after he fired his 
weapon.

'I would say the door was hit after the shots,' he told the court.

Col
 Vermeulen earlier demonstrated 
that height measurements showed that Pistorius was not wearing his 
prostheses at the time.

'It's quite low down on the door,' he testified about one of the marks he said were made by the bat.Â 

He said it was 'not the normal position that I would expect from a mark from a cricket bat'.

He said marks on the door were consistent with Pistorius 'being in a natural position without his prostheses'.

Defence
 lawyer Barry Roux countered that Pistorius hit the door with a 'bent 
back' and that the low marks were consistent with such a body position.

Mr
 Vermeulen also said a steel plate in the main bathroom in Pistorius's 
home had been damaged by being hit with a 'hard' object, or after the 
object fell against it.

Doubt cast: According to the athlete's account, he put on his prosthetic legs in an effort to kick down the door before using the cricket bat

The steel plate was new evidence. A photo of the damaged plate was shown.

Prosecutors say Pistorius intentionally shot 29-year-old Steenkamp after a fight.

Those
 prosecutors used Mr Vermeulen to show what they say are more 
inconsistencies in Pistorius's version of events by erecting the door in
 court and, behind it, an exact replica of the cubicle in his house. There was also a replica toilet.

The bullet-marked door also had what appeared to be white tags to indicate the bullet holes.

Pistorius
 shot at MIss Steenkamp four times through the door, hitting her in the hip, 
arm and head. One shot missed, the court has heard.

Led
 by questions from prosecutor Gerrie Nel, Mr Vermeulen removed his 
blazer and walked down from the witness stand and over to the door to 
demonstrate to the judge how he believes the door was hit in the 
pre-dawn hours of Valentine's Day last year.

He said he was particularly interested in two specific marks on the door that he concluded were made by the bat.

With
 the use of court photos and by kneeling down in court, Mr Vermeulen 
showed the low position that the person could have been in when striking
 the door with the bat.

The trial continues.

Doubt: Pathologist Gert Saayman said the partially digested vegetables he found in the model's stomach suggested Miss Steenkamp (pictured) had food less than two hours before her death at around 3am
