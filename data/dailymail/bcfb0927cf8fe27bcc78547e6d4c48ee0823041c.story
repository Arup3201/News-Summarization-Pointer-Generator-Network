This the secret document detailing Britain's offer to share the Falkland Islands with Argentina in 1974.

Harold Wilson's Labour government approached President Juan Domingo Perón with a confidential plan for shared rule.

But the deal, agreed by the then Argentine leader, was scuppered when he died just 20 days later.

Britain was said not to trust his successor, his widow María Estela Martínez, and so cut contact with the South American country.

Non-official: The document shows the offer from Harold Wilson's Labour government to President Perón

Plans: If the deal had gone through, it would have seen Argentine and British flags flying over the islands

Argentine newspaper La Nación today published what it said was a 'non-official document' from the British Foreign Office.

It shows that Britain made the offer to then President Perón, whose second wife was the famous Eva, or Evita, on June 11, 1974.

The
British Ambassador in Buenos Aires, James Hutton, gave Argentine 
Foreign Minister Alberto Vignes the text in a secret meeting.

The proposals would see both flags being flown over the islands, and Spanish and English being made dual official language.

A governor would also be put in place -
who would be decided, on a rotating basis, by the British monarch and 
the Argentine President.

The proposal would 'create a favourable atmosphere in which the islanders could develop according to their interests'.

It would also 'put an end to the dispute over sovereignty'.

It concluded: 'Covering these terms, the government of her Majesty proposes that, if the Argentine government agrees, we should realise official conversations in Buenos Aires as soon as possible'.

Perón is said to have reacted with 'euphoria', according to veteran diplomat Carlos Ortiz de Rozas who today spoke to La Nación.

Perón is said to have told his confidante: 'We accept. Once we get a foot on the Falklands no-one will remove us. Shortly after the sovereignty will belong to Argentina alone.'

War of words: In January Argentines branded Prince William a 'conqueror' after his six-week deployment to the Falkland Islands

But 20 days later he died and his ex-ballerina widow María Estela Marínez, known as Isable, was named as his successor.

The British government is said not to have trusted her and so cut all contact, according to the former ambassador.

The Foreign Office said discussions had taken place. A spokesman added: 'This does not detract from Argentina's illegal and unjustified act of aggression in invading the islands.'

Tensions between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 Falklands conflict, which cost the lives of 255 British and 649 Argentine servicemen.

It started to intensify in 2010, when oil exploration by British companies off the islands raised the stakes.

Last month Downing Street accused Argentina of pursuing a 'policy of confrontation' over the islands, after reports suggested Argentina's industry minister called for all British imports to be banned.

Anger: Argentina is renewing calls for the island to be handed to them

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office summoned an Argentinian envoy to London earlier this month to explain the proposed ban.

It also wanted to know what happened when the South American state's government prevented two cruise ships from docking following a visit to the Falkland Islands last month.

Britain recently deployed one of its most modern destroyers, HMS Dauntless, to the region, and although it insisted the move was merely routine, Argentina met with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the president of the UN Security Council after accusing Britain of  'militarising the South Atlantic.'

Prince William's arrival in the Falklands for a posting as an RAF search and rescue pilot was a move which further infuriated Buenos Aires.

Argentina has received the backing of Latin American countries for its claim of sovereignty of the islands, which were occupied by Britain in 1833.
