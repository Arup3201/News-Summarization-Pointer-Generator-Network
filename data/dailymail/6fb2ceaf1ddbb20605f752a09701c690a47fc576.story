They might once have drawn dismissive looks from your more culinary sophisticated classmates around the school dining table.

But the humble crisp sandwich has made the leap from guilty pleasure to foodie acceptance after the world’s first café selling the snack opened. 

Diners at the Simply Crispy café can hark back to their school lunchbox by choosing from dozens of different crisp flavours to fill their sandwich.

Pop-up café Simply Crispy in Belfast has opened allowing diners to hark back to their school lunchbox by choosing dozens of different crisps to fill their sandwiches. Owner Andrew McMenamin (above) said: 'Once we put it up on Facebook and Twitter that we were going to do this it just snowballed'

Customers can choose from 35 different crisp flavours and three different types of bread to make their ham and cheese sandwiches

The £3.50 dish at Simply Crispy is served with soup – topped with croutons made from Monster Munch crisps – and chips

The Belfast café, which sold out after only two hours following the opening yesterday, is the latest in a string of novelty dining establishments serving unusual or nostalgic fare.

Last month, a café opened in London selling more than 100 breakfast cereals from around the world.

The pop-up crisp sandwich café initially started life as a joke, when a satirical website ran a fake story about a ‘trendy’ establishment that was serving the ‘fashionable’ sandwiches.

But after being inundated with hundreds of comments lauding the venture, an intrepid business owner decided to team up with the website to make the idea a reality.

The pop-up café is expected to run for up to four weeks, although Mr McMenamin did not rule out opening the store on a long-term basis if it became a success

The crisp sandwich is a snack people remember from their school days, says owner McMenamin

Andrew McMenamin said he was inspired to transform his previous business, called That Wee Café, into the crisp sandwich shop after reading the spoof article.

Mr McMenamin has been told his crispy sandwich venture is 'the world's first' as the childhood snack makes a leap from guilty pleasure to foodie acceptance

‘We read the article online and it struck a chord – it was so funny. The comments and the feedback that came about from that got us thinking "we could probably do that",’ he said.

‘It is a school thing, people remember it from their school days, it is a classic and it is old-school.’

‘I have been told it is the world’s first. Once we put it up on Facebook and Twitter that we were going to do this it just snowballed.’

The venture is expected to run for up to four weeks, although Mr McMenamin did not rule out opening the store on a long-term basis if it became a success.

Customer Nerys Coleman, 32, said: ‘It is something from your childhood. I have not had a crisp sandwich since university and before that childhood so it is bringing back the nostalgia.’

Billy McWilliams and Seamus O’Shea, who penned the initial satirical article for their Ulster Fry website, said the process from spoof to reality was ‘crazy’.

Writing on their website, the comedy writers said: ‘Not only did people believe it, but people wanted to believe it and the story went viral.’

‘Thousands of people loved the idea of buying a crisp sandwich on the high-street or in a cafe.’

Tayto, a Northern Ireland-based crisp manufacturer which is one of the largest distributors in the UK, has teamed up with the café owner to provide the majority of the crisps, alongside brands including Walkers and Smiths.
