Liverpool's proposed move for Victor Valdes is in danger of collapse.

The free agent goalkeeper is reluctant to come in to train with Liverpool and prove his fitness despite being out of the game for six months with a cruciate ligament injury.

Liverpool want Valdes to provide competition for Simon Mignolet.

Valdes had originally been set for a move to mega-rich French side Monaco in the summer, but his injury put paid to the move.

The 32-year-old Spaniard is a legend at the Nou Camp after keeping goal in over 500 matches for the La Liga giants, winning three Champions League finals and six La Liga titles.

But he lost his place in the team to Chilean Claudio Bravo, who joined from Real Sociedad in the summer and has yet to concede in La Liga this season.
