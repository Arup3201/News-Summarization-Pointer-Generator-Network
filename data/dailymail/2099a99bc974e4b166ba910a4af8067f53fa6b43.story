Outspoken food critic Anthony Bourdain has stirred up outrage in New Mexico after insulting one of the state’s signature dishes.

The sharp-tongued chef and writer lashed into the ‘World Famous’ Frito pies sold at Santa Fe's well-known Five & Dime General Store's snack bar on a recent episode of his CNN show ‘Parts Unknown.’

A Frito pie consists of a bag of Fritos which then has chili and cheese mixed in with it.

'Colostomy pie': Outspoken food critic Anthony Bourdain has stirred up outrage in New Mexico after insulting Frito pie, one of the state's signature dishes

Bourdain described the southern delicacy as ‘feeling like holding a warm crap in a bag’ and ‘colostomy pie.’

The store manager of the Five & Dime where Bourdain ate isn’t happy after the celebrity chef was so quick to dismiss his food.

Bourdain had described the dish as tasting as if it were made with canned Hormel Chili and a ‘day-glow orange cheese-like substance.’ 

Mike Collins said Bourdain is 'completely wrong' about the store's Frito pie, which he says is homemade from chile grown in New Mexico and remains extremely popular with his customers.

Bourdain also upset locals by claiming that the local dish wasn't even a New Mexico meal, but rather a Texas creation.

He said the New Mexicans should have left the recipe to the Texans, although he also admitted that it was delicious.

In the CNN documentary series ‘Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown’ the chef travels the world on a mission to discover regional flavors, with a dash of geopolitical insight.

The show gave CNN its first Primetime Emmys when it won for outstanding informational series and outstanding cinematography for a nonfiction series at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards on Sept. 15.

In the episode on New Mexico, Bourdain took a close look at the mash-up of cultures that comprise the state's food - a combination of Spanish, Mediterranean, Mexican, Pueblo and even chuck-wagon influences.
