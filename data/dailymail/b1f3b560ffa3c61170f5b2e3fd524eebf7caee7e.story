The five members of the Van Den Hende family who tragically lost their lives in the fatal MH17 flight will be laid to rest in Australia.

Hans, 48, his wife Shaliza Dewa, 45, and their children Piers, 15, Marnix, 12 and Margaux, 8, lived in Australia for just five years and were on their way home from a holiday in Europe when the plane went down.

There was uncertainty surrounding where the final resting place of the family would be, as Hans' was from the Netherlands, Shaliza was Malaysian but they had put down roots in Australia.

They had been based in the Victorian town of Eynesbury for the past three years, and had formed close-knit bonds in the community where their children attended school and played in local sports teams.

Hans' sister told News Corp Australia the family would be buried in the country that they had made their home and were so happy in.

'We have agreed that they will be buried all together in Australia', Franka Van Den Hende said. She also revealed she had been contacted directly by the Prime Minister and Governor-General and greatly appreciated their support.

The family had been on a trip to Europe where they had 'just had a wonderful holiday going back to where they had met in the UK during their PhD studies, to my brother's home country the Netherlands and their family, and a week with my sister and their family in Denmark', Ms Van Den Hende said.

Tributes poured in for the much-loved family during a memorial held in the community last week, which more than 500 people attended. Many of the children's friends took the microphone to express their shock and dismay at the tragedy.

Close friend of the family Tanya Wilmott organised the ceremony, and told Daily Mail Australia the loss of the family was 'a difficult thing to comprehend'.

Ms Willmott said she got to know Shaliza because their children were around the same age and all went to the same school, ICA Melton College in nearby Caroline Springs. When the school closed suddenly, the two families transferred their kids to Bacchus Marsh College.

She also revealed last week she did not think Australia would be the family's final resting place, as they had family on Hans' side in the Netherlands and on Shaliza's side in Malaysia.

'She was just a beautiful person, so down to earth you would almost call her Australian,' Ms Willmott said.

'Shaliza really took to the Australian lifestyle. It sounds like a clich√© but it was a positive experience meeting this family. They touched people and you didn't forget them.'

Their neat weatherboard home 50 kilometres west of Melbourne is still full of their belongings, and members of the community have been at a loss on how to grieve for the family as the house lies empty and their bodies are yet to be returned.
