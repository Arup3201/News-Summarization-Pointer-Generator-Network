Found alive: Raymond Roth turned up on a highway in Santee, South Carolina, five days after going missing during a swim off Long Island

After a frantic five-day search for a man who went missing while swimming with his son off Long Island, New York, the 47-year-old father was found alive and well - in South Carolina more than 730 miles away.

‘He's not drowned and dead,’ New York State Park Police Capt. Bruce Marx said at a briefing on Thursday.

Raymond Roth, 47, of Massapequa, was reported missing Saturday after his 22-year-old son, Jonathan, told authorities the two had gone to Jones Beach and that his father went swimming but never returned.

The report prompted a desperate search and rescue operation involving police marine units, helicopters and officers who scoured the waters for several days, but to no avail. 

On Wednesday night, Roth’s brother contacted police and reported that he was somewhere in Florida, Marx said. By that time, the search for Roth had turned into a body recovery mission.

At around 3:30am Thursday, Roth was stopped by police going 90 mph on a highway in Santee, South Carolina, and issued a speeding ticket.

The officer who issued the ticket then
observed that Roth was listed in a national registry of missing 
persons; Roth said he was returning to New York and the officer let him 
proceed north.

It is not clear how Roth got to South Carolina or where he was coming from when he was stopped.

Last Saturday afternoon, Roth’s son told police he was texting on the beach while his father was taking his daily swim in calm waters in an area not protected by a lifeguard, according to CBS2.

When the 22-year-old looked up from his cell phone, he realized that his dad was nowhere to be found. He reported Roth missing, setting off a massive search and rescue operation involving multiple agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard.

So far, no criminal charges have been filed against the 47-year-old man. Marx estimated that the search effort cost ‘tens of thousands’ of dollars.

State park police got Roth's cell phone number from a relative and had several telephone conversations with him on Thursday.

Authorities said Roth told them he was heading back to Long Island and could arrive later in the day, although Marx said there was no way to know if that's true.

A LinkedIn page for Roth noted he worked for Level 3 Communications, a data networking company.

According to real estate records cited by NBC4, Roth's Cape Cod-style four-bedroom house in Massapequa was put up for sale for $549,999 on July 21, a week before he went missing.

Jane Stone, who has lived in Roth's neighborhood for more than 50 years, said Roth was always pleasant and would often use his snow blower to clear neighbors' walkways in the winter. She said she spoke to him sometime last week and he was proud to show off his home's renovations.

‘He was very happy and delighted and asked us to come over for a barbecue,’ she said, although they never followed through on the invitation. ‘He seemed very happy and everything, but this is before the house went on sale.’

Police are not sure if Roth orchestrated his disappearance in an effort to fake his death, NBC News reported. Roth's wife told investigators she thought her husband had drowned and had no idea about his true whereabouts.
