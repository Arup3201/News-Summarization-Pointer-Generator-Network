The wife of an Italian Mafia boss who spent 20 years hiding from authorities in London said on Monday that they came to Britain to escape their past.

Domenico Rancadore, 64, was given bail yesterday until an extradition hearing in February, but will remain in jail because prosecutors launched an immediate appeal.

His wife Anne Skinner, 64, told an extradition hearing that they had lived in the country undetected for 19 years.

Hiding: Anne Skinner, right,  the wife of an Italian Mafia boss Domenico Rancadore, 64, left, spent 20 years hiding from authorities in London said on Monday that they came to Britain to escape their past

Rancadore, also known as 'The Professor', was convicted of Mafia association and extortion in his absence in Italy in 1999 after moving his family to Uxbridge, West London, in 1994.

He was sentenced to seven years in jail, but never returned to the country.

Yesterday the prosecutor Hannah Hinto branded him a 'serious flight risk'.

Mrs Skinner, posted £50,000 cash in surety and Rancadore was told if he is released he will be under house arrest and have to wear an electronic tag.

The daughter of a former 
Italian consul to London, Mrs Skinner said: 'We wanted our children to have a 
different life to that environment where all they spoke about was Mafia.
There was nothing against his name when we left.

'We wanted to get away from our surname, we had been through so much, we needed a break.'

Mrs Skinner said they had changed their names once they arrived in England, with Rancadore posing as Marc Skinner.

The pair moved to the capital after two acquittals for Mafia activity in 1987, saying they wanted to 'get away' from their surname, infamous in Italy because Rancadore's father was a feared boss of the Sicilian Costa Nostra.

They arrived with their two children, Giuseppe, now 36, and Daniela, now 33.

Granting conditional bail at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Judge Riddle said: ‘The most recent behaviour complained about was over 18 years ago.

‘My colleagues who refused bail earlier had ample grounds to do so. However, over 14 weeks have passed and the extradition hearing is listed in February, which is over six months after arrest.

Admission: Anne and Daniela Skinner leave Westminster Magistrates Court. Mrs Skinner, posted £50,000 cash in surety and Rancadore was told if he is released he will be under house arrest and have to wear an electronic tag

‘There is no evidence put before me to suggest he had offended here or abroad in the last 18 years.’

After the ruling Rancadore, who had been holding a white bible throughout, blew a kiss to his wife.

Rancadore’s father, Giuseppe, was imprisoned as part of the notorious maxi trial in 1987 which saw 475 Mafiosi indicted.

Since fleeing from authorities, Anne claims the family have been running an executive travel agency, but that all of their clients have deserted them since Rancadore's arrest.

Italian authorities say Rancadore served as 'a man of honour' in the Cosa Nostra, collecting bribes from builders in Trabia near Palermo between December 1987 and April 1995.
