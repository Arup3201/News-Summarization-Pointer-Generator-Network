Six nuns are trapped in an ancient Christian village in Syria, the government has claimed, as Bashar al-Assad and members of his inner circle were implicated in war crimes for the first time.

Syrian army tanks were positioned around Maaloula as the fighting sent smoke wafting over the village nestled in hills about 40 miles northeast of the capital, Damascus. 

Forces loyal to President Assad are trying to keep rebels led by the Al Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra, or Nusra Front, from advancing. Opposition fighters have taken control of several parts of the village since blowing up a checkpoint at its entrance on Friday, according to reports by the state news agency and opposition activists.

The fighting is part of a wider battle over a string of towns and villages in the rugged Qalamoun border region in an effort to control a strategic highway and smuggling routes from neighboring Lebanon. 

The town had been firmly in the government's grip but surrounded by rebel-held territory until Friday. 

Five nuns and their Mother Superior, Pelagia Sayaf, were trapped in the Mar Takla Convent, which sits above Maaloula, according to SANA, the state news agency.

Kindah al-Shammat, Syria's minister of social affairs, demanded that countries supporting the rebels pressure them to release the nuns.

While the Observatory could not confirm the SANA report that Nusra fighters had entered the convent, a spokesman said the old part of Maaloula, which contains the convent, is now under control of the Nusra Front.

Many of the village's 3,000 residents have already fled to Damascus, fearing rebels would punish them for supporting Assad and because they are Christians. 

While two bishops and a priest have been kidnapped by rebels, no nuns have been reported harmed in the three-year conflict.

Syria's minorities, including Christians, have mostly sided with Assad's rule or remained neutral, fearing for their fate if rebels, dominated by Islamic extremists, come to power.

In the past, rebels have seized parts of Maaloula only to be driven out within a few days by government forces. 

Maaloula was a major tourist attraction before the conflict began in March 2011. Some of its residents still speak a version of Aramaic, a biblical language spoken by Jesus.

Separately, Navi Pillay, the United Nations human rights chief, claimed on Monday that evidence has been uncovered in Syria implicating Assad and members of his inner circle in war crimes and crimes against humanity.

A UN investigation into rights violations committed during the 33-month-long conflict found 'massive evidence' of the crimes. 

'The evidence indicates responsibility at the highest level of government, including the head of state,' according to the investigation.

It is the first time evidence by a UN-mandated commission has directly implicated Assad in crimes committed during Syria's civil war, which has killed an estimated 126,000 people, according to new figures released by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group.

The four-member UN investigative 
team, which has been investigating rights violations since shortly after
fighting broke out, has in the past accused both the Syrian regime and 
the rebels of war crimes.

For the first time however, they have now cobbled together a long and confidential list of suspected perpetrators.

With
no access to Syria, the investigators had to rely on more than 2,000 
interviews in the surrounding region or by phone or Skype for their 
reports.

Ms Pillay reiterated her call for the case to be handed over to the International Criminal Court in the Hague to ensure accountability.

'The scale of viciousness of the abuses being perpetrated by elements on both sides almost defies belief,' she said.

She warned that efforts to destroy Syria's massive chemical weapons stockpile should not distract from killings with conventional weapons, which have accounted for the vast majority of deaths in the conflict.

'This is my concern, that the inquiry into chemical weapons, which is utterly necessary, should not be used as a distraction from the fact that more than 100,000 people have been killed as the result of the use of conventional weapons.'

Despite international consensus on destroying the chemicals outside war-wracked Syria, no country has volunteered to have them destroyed on its soil.

The OPCW on Saturday said the United States has offered to destroy Syria's most dangerous chemical weapons on a vessel at sea through a process of hydrolysis.

Meanwhile in the northern city of Aleppo, at least 50 people were killed in two separate attacks over the weekend, according to activists. In one incident, at least 24 people were killed when shelling hit a bakery in the town of al-Bab.
