Furious Ryanair passengers say they were left confused and out of pocket after their flight was diverted to a different island in the Canaries.

The plane carrying 140 holidaymakers was heading to Lanzarote from Dublin on Saturday when it was forced to land on neighbouring Fuerteventura due to severe thunderstorms.

Passengers say they were told they would be able to hop on a ferry to complete their journey, but claim they were crammed onto buses and taken to the port without proper instruction.

A handful of passengers sent tweets to Ryanair to complain about the situation in Fuerteventura

Some grew frustrated with the lengthy wait at the airport and paid more than £30 for a taxi.

Passenger Max Kyck, who managed to board the first bus, told The Journal that many holidaymakers bought ferry tickets at their own expense after being told that none had been reserved.

At the airport, he said, a young worker tried to ‘herd’ all of the passengers outside to wait for buses, but she had no information about ferry tickets. 

He added: ‘When we got to the port shortly after 1pm there was nobody from Ryanair and nobody at the port knew anything about our tickets.

‘We waited a while and then bought tickets – €47 [£37] for two.’

Passengers had to pay for their own transport to their hotels once they arrived hours late in Lanzarote.

Several passengers sent tweets to Ryanair to complain about the situation.

Passenger Gareth Murran wrote: 'Your communication plan is shocking. 144 passengers left to make their own arrangements after flight diverted to Fuerteventura.'

Ryanair has apologised for the diversion and offered refunds to those who are out of pocket over taxi or ferry costs.

A spokesman for the Dublin-based airline told MailOnline Travel: 'All customers were transferred by ferry and coach from Fuerteventura to Lanzarote airport.

‘Customers who chose to make their own way to Fuerteventura are asked to submit receipted travel expenses for full reimbursement.

‘Ryanair sincerely apologised to all customers affected by this weather diversion.'

Passengers grew frustrated with the communication from Ryanair and the lengthy delay 

A similar incident occurred in 2010 when more than 100 Ryanair passengers on a flight from Bournemouth to Lanzarote were diverted to Fuerteventura during a thunderstorm.

The passengers complained about a lack of information from the airline and said they were forced to make their own travel arrangements to catch ferries and boats to Lanzarote.

One family said it was left £400 out of pocket after they had to pay for hotel accommodation and a 30-minute ferry crossing the next day.
