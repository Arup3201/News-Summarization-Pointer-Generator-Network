'All I was thinking of was his safety, and how he was going to be traumatized and how he is going to see the police now,' she said in a report to police, according to .

'I don't have a record, even as a youth. I've always helped others to better themselves and their lives and myself. And even my (other) son is a police officer,' Sinclair added to .

However LERA commissioner Max Churler said of the hundreds of complaints that are filed each year, most of which are for excessive force, only about four to six make it to a hearing.

Most are abandoned.

Winnipeg police have not commented on the incident.

Sinclair says she just doesn't want something like this happening to someone else.

She is still recovering from the painful wounds she sustained in the alleged attack.
