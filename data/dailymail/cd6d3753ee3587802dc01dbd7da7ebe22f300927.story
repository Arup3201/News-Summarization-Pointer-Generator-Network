'No training in stone design': Kristian Childs 
arrives for sentencing at Northampton Crown Court after admitting 
breaching health and safety rules

A builder whose company fitted a stone fireplace that collapsed on top of a four-year-old boy and crushed him to death has been fined more than £10,000.

Matthew Green died of internal injuries when the 110lb chunk of masonry dropped on to his chest and snapped in two in the living room of his new-build home in Towcester, Northamptonshire.

The boy was airlifted to Northampton General Hospital following the accident on October 15, 2005 but died hours later of heart injuries caused by blunt chest trauma.

Yesterday Kristian Childs, 43, - whose former company K D Childs Stonework fitted the fireplace - was fined £10,015 after admitting breaching health and safety regulations.

He pleaded guilty at Northampton Crown Court in April last year to breaching Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.

The court heard the stonemason had fitted the stone lintel to the new-build Persimmon home when it was built in 2003.

When the feature fell apart just two years later, crushing Matthew, it was discovered the fireplace had not been bolted into place but stuck with glue.

Matthew's father David had been greeting friends at the door when he heard a loud crash in the living room. He returned to the house to find his son slumped against the fireplace, dying.

Investigations concluded that there was a lack of mortar fixing the mantelpiece to the fireplace.

Prosecuting, Mark Harris, said: 'The mantelpiece fell and struck him, the fireplace had been designed by Mr Childs and was fitted by his employees.

'The immediate cause of the accident was the failure of the stonework which was not fixed properly.

'Mrs Green had been shopping shortly before 11am, the family was expecting friends around lunchtime.

'When they arrived the door was answered by Matthew who was excited to have visitors.

'Mr Green was in the hallway when Matthew then ran into the lounge and almost immediately he heard a crash and a thud from the lounge.

'On entering the room the found Matthew slumped against the fireplace with the mantelpiece across his chest in two.

'Emergency services were called, Mrs Green arrived home shortly before and Matthew and Mr Green were air-lifted to hospital where he died.'

An inquest in 2008 heard the family bought the four-bedroom detached property for £260,000 in June 2003 with the mantelpiece already installed.

Childs wasn’t charged until six years after the incident and pleaded guilty to failing to discharge his duty with the design and installation of the fireplace - thereby exposing Matthew to danger.

Lawyers acting for Persimmon Homes (Midlands) and its York-based parent company Persimmon Homes, who had sub-contracted Childs, entered not guilty pleas to failing in the construction of homes, 'to ensure persons not in employment were not exposed to risks to their health and safety'.

Charges against these companies were dropped.

Tragic: Matthew Green, four, was killed 
when a 110lb lump of stone from a fireplace installed by Childs's 
company dropped on to his chest. It was later found to have been held in
place with glue rather than bolts

Matthew's father David had been greeting friends at the door of their new build home on this street when he heard a loud crash in the living room. He returned to find his son slumped against the fireplace, dying

John Williams, defending Childs, said: 'Mr Childs wishes to make it very clear that he regrets this offence occurred.

'Matthew Green tragically died as a result of this offence and he offers his unreserved apologies to Mr and Mrs Green.

'Nothing I say afterwards should dilute this apology.'

Sentencing him, Judge Rupert Mayo said: 'Mr Childs had no training in stone design, manufacturing or restoration.

'He does not keep records, there are no sketches or method statements with his work.

'There is no doubt that his remorse and regret is genuine. His life has been affected greatly by the Greens’ loss.

'He is now divorced, a turnover on his business has gone from £400,000 to just £31,000. The news of the incident involving Matthew extinguished his business virtually overnight.

'For everyone connected with this case seven and a half years since Matthew’s tragic death must feel like a lifetime.

'This includes Mr Childs, who has never failed to accept his negligence.

'I am aware of his limited fees, his home is worth less than his mortgage, he does not own a car and has responsibilities to his own children.

'His only debt, I accept are genuine business ones, he was loaned £5,000 by his father to establish a modest property maintenance business.

'His net income is currently below £17,000 and he spends £16,000 on household expenses, in his council's words, he is just about keeping his head above the water.

'Any fine I make is not a value on the life of Matthew Green.

'To anyone that knew Matthew, to his friends and family, his life was perfectly beyond value.'

'An accident that should never have happened': Matthew's parents, Gail and David Green leaving court. In a statement they said they felt they had waited far too long for a resolution over their son's death

After after the sentence was passed, the Green family released a statement saying: 'On October 15 2005 we tragically lost our four-year-old son Matthew due to an accident that should never have happened, due to poor workmanship, no industry standards and lack of risk assessments.

'We feel that the house builder, Persimmon Homes, and the fireplace installer, K D Childs, were responsible for the death of our son.

'Unfortunately, due to irregularities in the HSE investigation the case against Persimmon Homes was dropped in April 2013.

'We have waited nearly eight years for the matter to eventually be finalised through the court which is in our opinion far too long to prolong the suffering and distress to our family.

'Whatever the outcome of the HSE prosecutions, nothing will bring back Matthew, but we want to insure that something is done to prevent incidents like this happening to any other child in the future

'Since the inquest in 2008 we are aware of at least two further children that have tragically been killed in incidents involving fire places.

'We cannot help but feel that had the matter been dealt with more promptly and in a different manner by all those involved at least one of those needless deaths may have been prevented.'
