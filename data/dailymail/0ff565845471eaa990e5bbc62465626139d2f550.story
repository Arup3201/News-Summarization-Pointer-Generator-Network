One of Princess Diana's oldest friends has spoken of her joy at becoming Prince George's godmother.

Julia Samuel told MailOnline that she was delighted at the honour and saw her role as an 'important responsibility'.

The inclusion of Mrs Samuel, 54, in yesterday's list of seven godparents was a poignant acknowledgement of William’s late mother.

She met and became friends with Diana in 1987 when the two were seated next to each other at a dinner and, according to Mrs Samuel, 'saw something in each other'.

Although the princess fell out with many of her friends, Mrs Samuel remained loyal.

William is now royal patron of the charity Child Bereavement UK, of which she is founder patron and trustee.

The charity does remarkable work in supporting families and professionals when a child dies or when a child suffers a bereavement themselves.

In her statement The Hon Mrs Michael Samuel - as she was referred to by Kensington Palace yesterday - said: 'I am delighted to have been invited to become godmother to His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.

'It is both a joyful and an important responsibility which I am incredibly proud to accept.'

Quiet: Prince George appeared contented as he was held by his mother on only his second public appearance since he was carried from the Lindo Wing in July 

Many will have been hoping for a recognition of Diana on such an historic day and Mrs Samuel's presence was just that.

Diana was also very much present not just in the engagement band that glints on the Duchess’s finger but in the very choice of the Chapel Royal itself, where her body lay before the altar so her family and friends could pay their respects in private, before her formal funeral in Westminster Abbey in 1997.

That link was also one of the reasons that Kate chose the chapel to be formally confirmed into the Church of England before her marriage to Prince William in April 2011.

Mrs Samuel is herself  a bereavement counsellor in the NHS paediatrics department of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington,  where Prince George was born.

Softly-spoken and a good listener, Julia, has her own private practice, and has 'been a source of strength for William'.

Born Julia Guinness and part of the famous brewing dynasty, one of her sisters — Sabrina — went out with Prince Charles. She married the Hon Michael Samuel, of the Hill Samuel banking family, and had the first of her four children at just 21.

After the excitement of yesterday's 
family christening at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, the Duke 
and Duchess of Cambridge were this morning sitting down with aides as 
they poured over the formal family photographs taken after the ceremony 
at neighbouring Clarence House by celebrity photographer Jason Bell.

Three
 will be released to the media later today including one historic shot 
that will, for the first time in more than a century, feature a monarch 
and three living heirs: the Queen, Prince Charles, 64, Prince William, 
31 and George.

The last 
occasion such picture was taken was in 1894 when Queen Victoria was 
photographed with her son Edward VII, grandson George V and great 
grandson Edward VIII.

Brother: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge asked their siblings to do the readings during the 45-minute ceremony, with Harry reading John (15: 1-5), which begins 'I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener'

LIZ JONES FASHION VERDICT: Perfection: the Queen wore a sky blue cashmere coat with mother of pearl buttons over a paisley dress by Scottish couturier Stewart Parvin, with a (warm!) cashmere hat made by her redoubtable dresser, Angela Kelly. The brooch is a ruby and diamond basket of flowers given to her by King George to mark the birth of Prince Charles in 1948

Siblings: Pippa and James Middleton walk out of the chapel with the small congregation, including their smiling mother Carole yesterday afternoon

In an historic ceremony which brought 
together four generations of the Royal Family, the three-month-old 
future king was christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury in the Chapel
 Royal at St James’s Palace yesterday.

Dressed
 in a handmade replica of Queen Victoria’s daughter’s christening robe, 
George bore a striking resemblance to his father at a similar age.

He was on his best behaviour. With the
 eyes of the world on him, His Royal Highness Prince George Alexander 
Louis of Cambridge put on a perfect display of royal etiquette.

According to aides, there wasn’t ‘even
 a peep’ out of the three-month-old future king as he was baptised by 
the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, at the Chapel 
Royal in St James’s Palace.

‘He went in smiling, came out smiling and, as far as we are aware, smiled throughout,’ said one.

William, however, could not resist confiding: ‘It’s the first time he’s been quiet all day.’

The
 Archbishop of Canterbury told the congregation in the Holbein-painted 
chapel that George’s parents and godparents had a ‘simple task’ – to 
‘make sure he knows who this Jesus is’.

The simplicity of the half-hour ceremony contrasted with the historic grandeur of the surroundings.

The
 heart of Mary I is buried beneath the choir-stalls and Elizabeth I 
prayed there for the defence of the realm against the Spanish armada in 
1588.

George’s life too, is 
already steeped in history. The Archbishop made the sign of the cross on
 his head with water taken from the River Jordan, in a royal tradition 
that dates back to the 12th century.

The
 water was poured into the silver Lily Baptismal Font which was 
commissioned by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1840 and has been 
used at every royal christening since.

His
 parents’ guest list for the christening – which left out senior members
 of the family including Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne –
 was a surprise to some. It did, however, result in the ‘intimacy’ the 
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge craved.

Indeed,
 there were just 23 guests present, giving the christening a feel of a 
family gathering rather than the moment a future Supreme Governor was 
presented to his Church.

For
 the Queen it was very much business as usual. She broke away from her 
schedule for only an hour – and was last night busy hosting a charity 
reception at the Palace.

Earlier,
 Kensington Palace unveiled the long awaited list of godparents. Among 
the seven, there was no royalty, just a smattering of close friends, 
relatives and advisers.

They
 are Oliver Baker, Kate and William’s flatmate at St Andrew’s, interior 
decorator Emilia Jardine-Paterson, William’s cousin Zara Tindall and 
his  childhood friend William van Cutsem, one of William’s most trusted 
confidantes.

At just 
22, Hugh, Earl Grosvenor, was the youngest. He is the son of one of the 
country’s richest men, the Duke of Westminster, whose wife, Natalia, is 
one of William’s godmothers.

Adding
 some gravitas to the group is  Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, one of 
William’s longest serving, loyal and most trusted aides, who now works 
for the royal household on a part-time basis.

It
 was in the Chapel Royal that Diana’s body lay before her funeral in 
Westminster Abbey in 1997. Kate also chose the chapel to be confirmed 
into the Church of England before her marriage to Prince William in 
April 2011.
