Detectives investigating the fatal shooting of a father in Leeds four years ago have released CCTV footage of a woman fleeing the murder scene.

Adam Chadwick, 20, was gunned down when three masked men and the woman burst into his sister's house in the Harehills area of the city in 2008.

He was visiting his sister Gemma on June 24 when at 9.40pm the female suspect knocked on the door and asked to speak to 'Michelle'.

Victim: Adam Chadwick, pictured with his daughter Ruby, was gunned down when three masked men and the woman burst into his sister's house in Leeds in 2008

She was told that nobody by that name lived there.

But an hour later, the woman again knocked on the door and asked for Michelle.

Three black men wearing masks and camouflage clothing then barged through the front door of the house.

A disturbance followed during which Mr Chadwick, whose daughter Ruby was three at the time, was shot in the head. He died two days later in hospital.

It is believed that he was shot in what could have been a case of mistaken identity.

Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley said: 'There were a number of people involved in this murder and I firmly believe discussions will have taken place among the communities of Leeds about those involved.

'With the length of time that has passed someone may now feel in a position to come forward and speak to us.

'I would urge that person to think about the potential difference they could make to Adam's family, who are desperate to know why he died and who was responsible.'

The woman is known to have knocked on other doors in the area and asked for 'Michelle' prior to the shooting.

Despite numerous appeals, including an appearance on BBC show Crimewatch, detectives have failed to solve the case.

They have now issued an e-fit of the suspect, who is in her late 20s, thin and with dark brown hair and prominent cheekbones. She was wearing a baggy black fleece or cardigan over a black round-neck top.

Previously unseen CCTV footage has also emerged that shows the suspects' getaway car, a Ford Focus C-Max, being stolen from a 48 year-old woman at Oatland Heights in the Little London area of Leeds two weeks earlier.

The dark blue car was abandoned close to Reginald Street in the Chapeltown district shortly after the murder.

Mr Chadwick's father Martin said he wants the murder to be solved for the sake of his now seven-year-old granddaughter.

He said: 'We want it to be sorted before she gets too old. We haven't lied to her, she doesn't know the full truth of what happened.

'She does keep asking questions, we tell her as truthfully as we can or we dare.'

Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley said: 'Adam was a hard-working lad and a much loved son, brother and father.

'His family deserve to know the truth and see those responsible for Adam's murder brought before the courts.'
