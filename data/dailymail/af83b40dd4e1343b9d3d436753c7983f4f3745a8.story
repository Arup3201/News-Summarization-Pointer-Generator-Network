No Neymar means no trophy and no trophy means no escaping the nightmare which has haunted Brazil for 64 years — ever since the last time they failed to win the World Cup on home soil.

That appeared to be the consensus as celebrations that followed a 2-1 win against Colombia in a pulsating quarter-final were tinged with  sadness.

Neymar’s injury had swiftly been confirmed as a broken vertebra, an X-ray was broadcast on television to prove the point and president Dilma Rousseff took to social media to offer her best wishes for a speedy recovery.

‘Forca Neymar,’ she tweeted, as did others such as model Gisele Bundchen, Miami Heat basketball star LeBron James and German footballers including Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski, who must have been secretly delighted to learn Brazil’s best player cannot face them in Tuesday’s semi-final.

Hundreds of bright yellow replica No 10 shirts on market stalls and hawked by street sellers seemed to sag in disappointment, crested hairstyles drooped around Brazil and bookmakers, for the first time, decided the hosts could no longer be considered favourites to win.

Neymar will not play again in this tournament.

The initial diagnosis predicted an absence of about six weeks from football and, while parallels can be drawn with Pele — the original  No 10 who also hailed from the  Santos club and was fouled out of a World Cup, ending Brazilian hopes in 1966 — others tried to lift the gloom.

Leading the campaign was David Luiz, climbing the popularity polls with a statesmanlike air.

Not only is he scoring precious goals, like the brilliant free-kick against Colombia, but the centre-half has a canny knack for connecting with the masses.

‘To play in a semi-final of the World Cup is a dream,’ said Luiz. ‘When I was young, I dreamed of days like this but I am sad because Neymar is out of the competition.

'He is like my brother. He is a great guy, a great person and a great player who brings the good things to football: happiness and magic.

‘Brazil will suffer a lot from this loss but Neymar will help us with his happiness. We have made a pact to support him. He will grow taller from this moment. It would be great if we could win it and celebrate with him.’

Inside the squad, Neymar is so much more than an icon of youth culture. You can see that the warmth and affection colleagues reserve for him is genuine when you watch them training, where he laughs if one of his tricks fails and he is teased like anyone else.

True, he is their most gifted creative force, capable of lifting Brazil out of the ordinary, but he also grafts and offers more humility than you might expect for a diamond-studded 22-year-old whose image appears at every turn and who is adored by millions.

‘Neymar is a boy who fights a lot,’ said Luiz. ‘He dreamed about playing in a World Cup and now he is out because of a foul the defender probably should have avoided.’

Colombia’s Juan Zuniga is Brazil’s new public enemy, the man who rammed his knee into the base of Neymar’s spine as they contested the ball near the end of the quarter-final.

Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari claimed his star man had been ‘hunted’ by opponents after his terrific start to the tournament.

Neymar suffered a knee injury against Chile when he was cut down in full flight. The Brazil manager, however, swerved the fact that his own side had employed strong-arm tactics on Friday in a bid to silence James Rodriguez, of Colombia.

Luiz added: ‘I never crucify players. You do things when you are emotional and don’t think.

'I will just say if he did it with bad intentions because he wanted to  injure him, then I think he will feel sad. If he just tried to stop the game that’s natural, that’s football.’

Brazil captain Thiago Silva offered support for Zuniga. ‘I know him from Serie A and he does not have any nastiness in him,’ said PSG defender Silva, who was formerly at AC Milan.

‘What he did was rash but I know it can be difficult to get the ball from Neymar.’

The challenge is to prove there is life after Neymar for a team that have come to rely rather too heavily on his invention and goal threat. Without him, they will fret about how much they can create from open play.

Against Chile and Colombia, the goals came from centre-halves Luiz, who scored twice, and Silva, all from set-pieces. Who wins most of these free-kicks and corners? Neymar, by dribbling at defenders.

In his absence, there will be a greater onus on others. Oscar is expected to return to a central role, which he will relish, and his Chelsea team-mate Willian is among the candidates to come in against Germany in Belo Horizonte.

Almost as bad for Scolari is the loss of Silva. The captain is suspended after picking up a yellow card for interfering with a kick by Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina.

Silva was magnificent in the  quarter-final on Friday. He is the team’s strongest and most reliable defender, providing the stability which allows Luiz to step forward and contribute on the counter-attack.

The loss will be eased by the return of defensive midfielder Luiz Gustavo after a one-match ban but will still be keenly felt.

‘This is the moment to show the strength of the squad,’ said Silva. ‘This moment could mark the start of a revolution for us.

'We have proposed to win the World Cup for Neymar. This could unite us. It could give us more determination to win.’
