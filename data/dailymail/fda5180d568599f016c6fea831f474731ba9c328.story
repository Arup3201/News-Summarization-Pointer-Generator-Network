A cleaner has been reunited with his wallet after dropping it in to a marina 100 feet deep more than two years ago.  

Daniel Dymond's leather wallet slipped out of his pocket into the water while he was working in November 2012.

The 23-year-old thought he'd lost it forever until a diver found it while carrying out maintenance work on some pontoons.

Cleaner Daniel Dymond was reunited with his wallet, including his driving licence and a Lloyds bank card, two years after he dropped it in to the Mayflower Marina in Plymouth, Devon 

Mr Dymond, who works for Cleancoast Services, said he 'couldn't believe' the wallet had been discovered near Mayflower Marina, in Plymouth, Devon.

Remarkably it still contained his driving licence as well as a Lloyds bank card and Iceland and Game store cards.

He told the Plymouth Herald: 'It's amazing because I thought I'd never see it again.

'I remember reaching down to pick up a log from the water and then I heard something drop into the water. I looked over and just saw a few bubbles and then realised what had happened.

'When I was told it had been found I couldn't believe it. The water there is so deep I thought it was gone forever. I'm well chuffed.' 

Charles Bush, managing director of Mayflower Marina, described it as 'remarkable' saying the chances of finding the wallet 'were pretty much nil.' 

'It's an astonishing story especially when you consider the depth of the water and the tides', he said. 

'When he lost it, Dan was working in the deepest part of the marina which has a depth of about 30 metres.

'If divers are operating on the seabed, at that depth, they would have about 20 minutes of bottom time.

'The chances of them stumbling across a wallet would be pretty much nil. It was a chance find and that's what makes it even more remarkable.

'When you imagine the storms we had last year, and the amount of movement in the water it is simply remarkable that they've found it.'

The wallet was discovered by diver Chris Church, carrying out maintenance work on some pontoons near Mayflower Marina (pictured) - he then handed it in to the marina's reception who identified Mr Dymond

Mr Dymond, who lives in Plymouth, was reunited with the wallet after the diver, Chris Church, handed it in to the marina's reception who identified the cleaner.

Rikkie Carette, 51, owner of Cleancoast Services, picked up the wallet and phoned him to pass on the news.

He told the Plymouth Herald: 'I honestly just can't believe it.

'When I heard that they had found it my immediate response was "I remember him losing it - but that was over two years ago".

'It's more than 100ft deep in places where he lost it and there's a strong tidal pull. When you think about it it could have drifted a long way away but it didn't. It's unbelievable that it hasn't been washed away.'

He said he wasn't surprised when Mr Dymond lost the wallet.

'He is a bit accident prone', he revealed.
