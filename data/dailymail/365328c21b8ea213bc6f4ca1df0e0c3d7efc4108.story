One of the most historic active studios in country music history will be torn down to build luxury apartments unless somebody comes to its rescue by end of play today.

RCA Studio A in the heart of Nashville, Tennessee, has been visited by a host of country stars including Willie Nelson, Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys and Dolly Parton.

But unless a solution is found in the eleventh hour it seems that the recording studio will become the latest victim of the gentrification transforming the city.

To many in the music industry, RCA Studio A has become a symbol of 'old Nashville' and the city's rich musical legacy.

The studios were constructed in 1965 at the request of Chet Atkins, who was originally looking for a place to track string parts for Elvis Presley's gospel albums.

Current tenant Ben Folds, who has been who has been recording artists in the studio since 2003, has been campaigning to save the space for several months after learning it would be sold to new ownership.

'I've recorded all over the world and I can say emphatically that ￼there's no recording space like it anywhere on the planet,' Mr Folds wrote in an impassioned open letter. 'These studio walls were born to ring with ￼music.'

He added: 'I had no idea of the extent of legacy of this great studio until I become the tenant of the space 12 years ago.

'I can't tell you how many engineers, producers and musicians have walked into this space to share their stories of the great classic recorded music made here that put Nashville on the map.

'I've heard tales of audio engineers who would roller skate around the room waiting for Elvis to show up at some point in the weeks he booked, stories about how Eddy Arnold recording one of the first sessions in the room and one of the songs was Make The World Go Away, Dolly Parton (Jolene) and The Monkees recorded here, and so on.'

Mr Folds fought an energetic campaign to save the studios and drew a crowd of about 200 during a Music Row rally a few months ago.

But he revealed last month that his landlord Bravo Development had more than doubled the rent, leaving him no choice but to bow out.

The famous recording studios are nondescript from the outside but they have have hosted some of the greatest country musicians of all time

However, not everybody in the creative industry is opposed to closing the doors of the recording studio. In an open letter, acclaimed country guitar player Harold Bradley - a former owner of RCA Studio A - rebuked anyone willing to stand in the way of progress.

'What makes a place historic?' he asked. 'The architecture of the Nashville sound was never brick and mortar. Certainly, there are old studio spaces that, in our imaginations, ring with sonic magic; but in truth, it's not the room, it's the music.'

'Music city isn't about a perfect room, or hanging just the right baffling,' he added. 'Turns out, the architecture of Nashville's evolving sound is a synergy of creative energy. That's still here, and it has nothing to do with this building.'

But other in the music industry argue that RCA Studio A has since grown into a landmark and stands as a metaphor for the music that built Nashville into a thriving city.

Along Nashville's famous Music Row, commercial development is pushing out the eclectic mix of recording studios, record label buildings, publishing houses and music industry office space.

At least two studios have been torn down in the last year, and the district is shrinking.

'There's a squeeze going on,' said Mike Kopp, president of the Music Industry Coalition, which includes hundreds of music executives, songwriters, musicians and fans. 

'It's been squeezed down to about three or four streets ... and that continues to get squeezed.'
