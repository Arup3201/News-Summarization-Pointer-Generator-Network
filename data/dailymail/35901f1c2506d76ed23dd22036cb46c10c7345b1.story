The menu at a stone age barbecue was ox ribs with bone marrow as a side dish, researchers have discovered.

Ancient man liked to cook up the ribs of the auroch, a wild ox that was larger than a cow, and eat them on the spot as a ‘reward’ for the kill.

He would also hack off the legs and suck out the bone marrow from the beast before carefully strimming the remainder of the meat and taking it back to camp.

Meat feast: Ancient man liked to cook up the ribs of the auroch - a wild ox that was larger than, and the ancestor of, a cow - and eat them on the spot

Researchers have found that even though barbecue technology has not changed much over the years, the method of getting the meat has.

Stone age man had no supermarkets to go to, so would catch his meat by setting pitfall traps then clubbing the animal on the head.

The details emerged from the leftovers of a barbecue which took place7,700 years ago in the valley of the River Tjonger, Netherlands.

The remains show evidence that the hunting, butchering and feasting took place even though it would be 1,000 years before farmers would bring cattle to the area.

In its place would be the auroch which would be caught, skinned and partly cooked there and then.

According to Discovery News, marks on the flint show how the meat was carefully separated from the bone so it could be taken back and eaten later.

Burn marks however show that the ribs were eaten on the spot with ancient man so keen to have his fill he let the blade get burned in the process.

Marcel Niekus, an associate professor of archaeozoology at the University of Groningen, told Discovery News: ‘The people who killed the animal lived during the Late Mesolithic (the latter part of the middle Stone Age).

‘They were hunter-gatherers and hunting game was an important part of their subsistence activities.’

While man went on to become the world’s dominant animal, the aurochs’numbers declined and the last one died at a zoo in Poland in 1627.

‘It became extinct due to the destruction of the habitat of the aurochs since the arrival of the first farmers in Europe about 7,500 years ago,’ Prummel said.

‘These farmers used the area inhabited by aurochs for their dwellings, arable fields and meadows. The aurochs gradually lost suitable habitat.’

The research was reported in the Journal of Archaeological Science.
