Bus driver Jasminder Singh Dhesi, 50, pleaded to causing the deaths of two men killed in a motorway crash

A coach driver has admitted causing the deaths of two men killed in a horrific motorway crash after he parked on a carriageway moments before a lorry ploughed into it.

Jasminder Singh Dhesi, who will be sentenced next month, was arrested in March last year after a coach carrying fruit-pickers was struck by a lorry on the M5 near Birmingham.

Lorry driver William Mapstone, from Wells in Somerset, died in hospital after the collision, while a passenger on the Volvo coach, Liaquat Ali, also suffered fatal injuries.

Dhesi, 50, was driving along the 
inside lane of the southbound M5, near Frankley Services, in thick fog 
when he started having problems with the single-decker bus he was 
driving.

A court heard he continued on with his journey regardless - despite the vehicle only being able to reach a top speed of 26mph.

The
coach then broke down for a third time 10 minutes later and Dhesi 
parked it in the slow lane of the southbound carriageway between 
junctions 3 and 4.

Moments later a lorry ploughed into the back of the stranded vehicle killing the truck driver and a coach passenger.

The Central Motorway Police Group was alerted to the crash at 6.24am and emergency crews treated more than 39 passengers.

Seven ambulances attended the scene following the crash and the southbound M5 was closed for around eight hours.

The driver of the Volvo HGV, William Mapstone, 65, from Wells in Somerset, was rushed to hospital but died shortly after 9pm.

In court: Jasminder Singh Dhesi was driving the coach pictured to the front right. He today pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving

Father-of-three Liaquat Ali, 35, from
Smethwick, West Midlands, who was a passenger on the coach carrying 
fruit-pickers, was also confirmed dead at the scene.

Shocking pictures taken at the time showed the mangled wreckage of the HGV's cabin embedded into the back of the coach.

Dhesi,
from Great Barr, Birmingham, today pleaded guilty to two counts of 
causing death by dangerous driving at Birmingham Crown Court.

Casualties: More than 20 people were injured in the crash southbound on the M5 in the West Midlands between junctions 3 and 4

Prosecutor Neil Bannister told the 
court: 'The coach did break down three times. The defendant admits that 
he was aware it had broken down three times.

'The analysis showed all three break-downs were on the motorway.

'After the first break-down he managed to get up to a speed of 26mph and then it broke down a second time.

'He knew he was in difficulty at that point. Conditions were poor.

'The defendant then took the decision
knowing that his coach was in a poor state to take that risk to drive 
off again and on driving off again it only reached a speed of 25mph and 
then broke down a third and fatal time.'

Wearing a grey suit with a purple turban, Dhesi showed little emotion as he was warned he almost certainly faced prison.

Judge Peter Carr bailed Dhesi and ordered him to return to court on February 12 for sentencing.

He
told him: 'You've pleaded guilty to a very serious offence in admitting
that the deaths were your fault - prison is inevitable.'
