Killer: Steven Grieveson, 42, (pictured) was convicted today of murdering Simon Martin in 1990 after confessing his crime to police

A serial killer who strangled three teenage boys in the nineties has been convicted of the murder of a fourth.

Steven Grieveson, 42, was already serving three life sentences when he confessed to killing 14-year-old Simon Martin in 1990.

He told officers that he had lured the boy to an abandoned building after playing football with him.

Grieveson, a former fairground worker and kitchen assistant, then confessed to sexually abusing Simon, before strangling him and bludgeoning his face with a rock.

He denied murder at Newcastle Crown Court, claiming he had diminished responsibility because he had mental problems.

But after a nine-day trial the jury today found him guilty, and he was sentenced to at least 35 years in jail.

The notorious killer had previously been found guilty of killing three other teenagers - Thomas Kelly, 18, David Hanson, 15 and David Grieff, also 15, between 1993 and 1994.

He strangled all three of them and burned their bodies to hide the evidence. 

But the murder of Simon in May 1990 had remained a mystery for years after his remains were found in the abandoned house a week after he was murdered.

Grieveson did not give evidence during the trial, but the court heard it reported that he claimed all four deaths were accidents.

He said he killed them unintentionally while he was threatening his victims to ensure they did not tell anybody that he was bisexual.

Grieveson told police last year that after performing a sex act with Simon he killed him on a mattress in a room at Gillside House in Roker, Sunderland.

He said: ‘After it was finished I got scared and
 I started shouting at him not to tell anyone.

‘I just flipped, I flipped, just flipped for a minute then I started strangling him then, I don’t know, I didn’t let go.

‘The
 next thing he was on the bed and I got scared and I think there was a 
rock or something and I smashed his head in.

'It was haunting me for 20 years. I have self-harmed because of it. It drove me crazy and I needed to give the family peace of mind and peace of mind for myself as well. I can't move forward unless this has been said.

Grieveson had kept quiet when investigators questioned him in the past, and said nothing when a former schoolmate was charged with the murder. The case against the innocent man was eventually dropped.

Simon, who lived in Sunderland with his 
parents Robert and Jean, was last seen alive on May 18 1990 when he went
 to play out with friends at 5pm.

The court heard he was told to be home for his tea by 6pm.

But prosecutor William Lowe told jurors: ‘He never came home.’

Simon was reported missing that night and his body was found by two children playing in the disused house a week later.

He had died as a result of brain injury, with compression of the neck a contributing factor.

The court also heard that Grieveson had told a woman who visited him in jail that 'the need to kill took him over' when he murdered the boys.

The woman, who told detectives she was writing a book about the killings, was said to have given gifts and money to the killer in order to 'manipulate' him.

Grieveson, who was flanked by five guards throughout the trial, showed no emotion as his crimes were described to the jury.

believed he used violence to keep them quiet after sex, or to force them
 into engaging in homosexual acts

He called on expert evidence in an attempt to show he had a severe mental condition that led to him killing Simon.

Professor
 Derek Perkins told the court during the trial Grieveson has 
‘psychopathic traits’ to his personality which, mixed with 
vulnerabilities which makes for a ‘dangerous combination’.

The
 professor said: ‘His lack of emotion, callousness, lack of remorse are 
elements that would have contributed to his ability to kill, more than 
once.’

Grieving members of Grieveson’s victims’ families staged a daily vigil in the public gallery to hear what had happened during their sons’ final moments.

It was on 26 November 1993 Thomas Kelly’s body was found burning in an allotment shed behind Monkwearmouth Hospital.

On 8 February 1994 David Hanson’s charred remains were found in a derelict house in Roker.

And on 25 February 1994 David Grieff’s body was found in an allotment shed at the rear of Monkwearmouth Hospital.

Grieveson was sentenced for the fourth murder this afternoon, after the court was adjourned, though he decided not to be in court for the sentencing.

Mr Justice Ramsey said: ‘You are a sexual predator. You will murder young 
boys or men who do not comply with your wishes for sexual 
gratification.

'Precisely what happened is known only to you. There is powerful evidence you strangled him as part of a sexual act then gratuitously smashed his skull.

‘I hope the family of Simon Martin
 can now feel there has been some closure of this case, justice has been
 done and they can now move on with their life.’

Speaking outside of court, Simon's father Robert Martin gave a statement to reports on behalf of his family.

He thanked the police and investigators who brought the case to justice, and said: 'It has been traumatic and life changing for all the families.

‘Now, Grieveson will spend the rest of his days behind bars.

‘No other family should suffer the heartache we have had to go through and I am sure the families behind me agree.

‘Our sons were taken away from us by a cruel man whose despicable actions cost four boys their lives.

‘These were innocent boys whose actions led in no way to their devastating and tragic deaths.’
