Every day teenager Shannon Blastland topples over as her body gives way and her bones slip out of place.

In the last five years the 15-year-old has dislocated her spine, both shoulders, ankles, her neck, fingers and both wrists.

The 15-year-old from Grimsby in Lincolnshire, suffers Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), a condition which affects the collagen in her body - the connective tissues in the body.

The rare illness causes Shannon's bones to slip out of place, causing her to tumble to the floor.

Shannon Blastland, 15, suffers the rare condition Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which causes her bones to slip out of place and dislocate without any warning. Her father Shane Fielding, pictured, is on hand to help his daughter pop her joints back into place, but when her neck or spine dislocates, she has to be taken into hospital

The teenager, from Grimbsy in Lincolnshire, has dislocated her spine, both shoulders, her wrists, fingers, ankles and neck in the last five years 

Every bone in her body, including her spine and ribs, can dislocate without any warning.

Shannon said: 'I am just like jenga - when one bit of me goes out of place I just topple over.

'I can guarantee that one part of me will go every day but I just have to be careful.

'Sometimes I can just pop the bone back into place and pick myself up but I do often end up in an ambulance.'

Since her diagnosis three years ago, Shannon has had to be careful when carrying out even the simplest of tasks.

Shannon said: 'I can’t walk out to the shops because I can’t walk too far without one of my joints going.

'I can’t dance because of my legs and I can’t play football with my younger brother and sister because that’s a guaranteed dislocated bone.

'I tried to start martial arts but every session ended with me in an ambulance so I had to give that up and even yoga had to go as it just made me more bendy.

'The only thing I can do which is safe is swimming - but then I did dislocate my leg last time I went.

'It does bug me but it is just one of those things.'

Each day at least one of her bones slips out of place, causing Shannon to fall to the floor

Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a collection of inherited conditions, known as heritable disorders of connective tissue.

Connective tissues provide support in skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bones.

There are different types of EDS, which can cause:

The fragile skin and unstable joints may be the result of faulty collagen.

Collagen is a protein in connective tissue that acts as a 'glue' in the body, adding strength and elasticity.

The different types of EDS are caused by alterations in certain genes that make collagen weaker.

In some cases the amount of collagen in the body is reduced.

The faulty genes can be passed from parents to their children.

Shannon was healthy until the age of 10, when EDS started to take control of her body.

She said: 'I was standing in my doorway at home as my parents were decorating my bedroom when I suddenly collapsed into a heap on the floor.

'I asked my step dad for help to get back up and he saw my knee. He popped it back in to place and rushed me to hospital.

'I had dislocated it but they didn’t know why. After dislocating the same knee at least eight times I went to see a specialist.

'He thought it could be growing pains but said he couldn’t do anything as I was still growing.

'I had an operation but it didn’t seem to work.'

Eventually Shannon was booked in to see a specialist at Sheffield Children’s Hospital in 2012.

Shannon said: 'Since being diagnosed with EDS in 2012, I have dislocated my spine, both my shoulders, my ankles, my neck and many other parts of my body including my fingers and wrists.

'If it is a small part of my body then my dad will sort me out and just pop it back in place.

'But if it is more serious like my back or my neck, I have to be taken to hospital in an ambulance.'

Shannon dislocates a different part of her body almost every day and says most people do not understand her condition.

She
 said: 'I was picked on at school because one day I would be in a 
wheelchair after dislocating something and the next day I would be 
walking.

'People didn’t understand it, so my family and I decided I should be home schooled.

Shannon said: 'I am just like jenga - when one bit of me goes out of place I just topple over'

'I will go back to school at some point soon though, and am looking forward to making more friends.

'Although I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, I will keep picking myself up and I will never let it beat me.'

Lara Bloom from Ehlers-Danlos Support UK says: 'EDS is a multi-systemic connective tissue condition that has a broad spectrum of symptoms. There are six types and one of them can be fatal.

'It is often not taken seriously enough by the medical community and it is commonly missed and under diagnosed.

'We are trying to prevent this and raise awareness so that those living with the condition can get an early diagnosis and support with good management and understanding at school and in the workplace.'
