Andy Murray will use his first appearance in London since Wimbledon to try and win back some of the followers he lost by publicly declaring his support for the break-up of the United Kingdom.

The former Wimbledon champion opens the Barclays World Tour Finals at the 02 Arena on Saturday with a group match against Japan's Kei Nishikori, who is making his debut in the field open only to the season's top eight performers.

Murray spent six weeks battling to qualify, and it will be interesting to see if there is any delayed fallout from his Tweet in the early hours of Scottish referendum day, in which he revealed a late conversion to the idea of independence.

The British No 1 finished the year strongly to qualify for the elite eight-man event

'I haven't had an adverse reaction, the crowd has always given me very good support when I have played here and when I have played at Wimbledon and Queen's throughout my whole career,' he said.

'I hope this week that is the same, but if not I will do my job and give my best effort regardless. Hopefully I'll win back some fans this week.'

The sometimes impulsive Murray recently intimated he regrets the way he expressed himself, having managed to alienate numerous supporters in England and Scotland – not to mention upsetting his sponsors – in less than 140 characters.

He has also reaffirmed his pride in representing Great Britain, but definitely he has much ground to make up after five years spent winning over more sceptical sections of the public with his maturity and outstanding career achievements.

Given the nature of tennis support in this country there is unlikely to be any perceptible hostility in the coming week, although this is an event where his backing has not been as unequivocal as it is at Queen's or Wimbledon.

Two years ago he played Roger Federer at the 02 and the cheering made it hard to tell who was the home player, although that was largely down to the Swiss master's global icon status and the international mix of the huge crowds this tournament attracts.

He is sure to play Federer again this week and will have to turn round a strangely poor record against the 33 year-old at the east London venue, which sees the world number two having won on all three occasions.

Murray does not believe crowd support has been a factor, more the excellence of Federer in these conditions: 'The reason why he is difficult to beat is that he is incredibly good on these courts. He is a fantastic indoor player and has been all his career. When there is no wind or sun to throw him off, when he is on his game, he is incredibly tough to beat, but hopefully I will be able to do it this week.'

The Serbian is more than likely to finish the year as the world's No 1 ranked player

Take away the World Finals in London and the 27 year-old Scot leads their career series 11-8. 'I'm quite surprised how well I have played Andy here, some matches I thought I might lose,' said Federer. 'I don't see this surface being helpful either to me or to him.'

The Swiss could mathematically take the year-end number one spot this week, but that would require an unexpected collapse from the incumbent Novak Djokovic, a three-times winner who has a habit of finishing the season strongly.

Any suspicions that Djokovic might be distracted by the birth of his first child three weeks ago where quashed at the Paris Masters, which he won without dropping a set.
