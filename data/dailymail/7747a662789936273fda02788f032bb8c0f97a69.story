The mother of a 27-year-old woman who gave birth in a bar bathroom and stuffed the healthy baby boy in the toilet has revealed her daughter had struggled with 'very severe depression' and hard drugs.

Karen H. Giesen, 51, said her only daughter Amanda Catherine Hein, from Pennsylvania, had been hospitalized for mental-health issues and had battled a substance abuse problem.

Giesen said her daughter kept her troubles to herself, including her pregnancy: 'I don't know what she was going through because she never told me. She kept that completely to herself.'

Held: Amanda Catherine Hein, 27, will remain behind bars while she 
awaits trial for killing her baby son moments after he was born healthy 
and alive

Hein is charged with murder and could face the death penalty if convicted because of the age of the baby

Prosecutors said Hein gave birth to an 'alive and viable' boy - carried from 33 to 36 weeks - in the bathroom at Starters Pub in Lower Saucon Township on August 18 before continuing to watch a pay-per-view wrestling match with three male friends.

She reportedly found out she was pregnant in May or June but didn't tell anyone.

Authorities believe Hein tore the umbilical cord with her hands, and cleaned up the stall before leaving the bathroom. She was in the bathroom for about 40 minutes.

On August 19, janitors found the infant's body after the toilet wouldn't flush. Opening the tank, they uncovered the body wrapped in a plastic bag that had lined a small garbage can in the stall.

The Lehigh Valley Express-Times reported an autopsy found that Hein had given birth to a healthy, full-term baby boy and the child had suffocated to death.

Hein is being held in Northampton County Prison awaiting her October 28 preliminary hearing. It is not known who the father is.

Speaking out for the first time, Hein's biological mother Giesen told The Morning Call she was devastated that her daughter had suffered in silence.

'I just wish she would have even texted me and said, 'Please help me',' Giesen, of Coopersburg, said.

'I'm her mother and the thing that breaks my heart is she didn't come to me. She didn't ask for help.'

Giesen
said her daughter, who had no significant criminal history, documented 
domestic abuse or civil judgments due to financial hardship, was 'very 
fragile'.

'She told me she thought I hated her and I don't hate her. I love her,' Giesen said.

She said she'd tried to get psychiatric help for Hein, but there was little she could do because her daughter was an adult.

Giesen, a born-again Christian, said she and her daughter 'don't see eye to eye on moral issues' and she didn't approve of Hein's lifestyle or ex-boyfriend.

'I don't judge her,' Giesen said. 'Anything I didn't agree with I kept to myself, because what was I going to do?'

At the time of the shocking incident, Hein's stepmother, Louiseann
Hein, told The Morning Call that her troubled stepdaughter lived with her and her husband in Allentown,
Pennsylvania for the last six months.

She never suspected that Hein, then 26, was pregnant.

Mrs Hein said she recalled having a conversation about pregnancy with Hein when the young woman received a piece of mail Planned Parenthood.

'I told her she always had a home here,' Louiseann Hein told the newspaper, as she struggled to maintain her composure. 'We would make room. Would find a way.'

Hein said she realized she was pregnant in May or June but never told anyone about it

The grisly find at a popular pub shocked residents of the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania

Because of the age of the child, Hein could be sentenced to death, if convicted of murder.

Bar owner David Rank said his staff were extremely upset by the grisly incident. He allowed 
those who wished to go home, others opted to stay and Rank opened the 
pub to customers at 1pm, two hours later than usual.

'My biggest concern is for my employees, the mother, the baby,' said Rank. 'I just want everyone to say prayers for them.'

Police were led to Hein by her friend Luis Rivera, who booked the booth at the bar.Â 

When
she was questioned by officers, Hein reportedly admitted that she had given birth 
to a live baby and that she had killed him and hid him the toilet after 
wrapping him in a plastic bag she took from the bathroom garbage can.
