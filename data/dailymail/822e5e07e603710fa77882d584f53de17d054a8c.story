A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation, founded by Bill in 2001, said it would review foreign donations if Hillary runs for president

A charity founded by former President Bill Clinton has defended receiving donations from foreign governments even as Hillary is tipped to join the next race for the White House.

The Clinton Foundation recently lifted a self-imposed ban on foreign donations and launched a $250million endowment drive, receiving money from the likes of Saudi Arabia and Oman.

And today the organisation, which is run by Bill and Hillary along with daughter Chelsea, defended the practice, saying they would review it if any presidential campaign was launched.

A spokesman said the non-profit receives support from 'individuals, organizations and governments from all over the world' and that its programs improve the lives of millions of people.

The spokesman added: 'Should Secretary Clinton decide to run for office, we will continue to ensure the foundation's policies and practices regarding support from international partners are appropriate, just as we did when she served as secretary of state.'

According to the Wall Street Journal the foundation has received money from the United Arab Emirates and a Canadian government agency promoting the Keystone XL pipeline.

The Post found the foundation had raised nearly $2billion since  it launched in 2001. 

About one-third of the foundation's donations of $1million or more came from foreign governments or entities based outside the United States, the Post analysis found. 

The charity has since agreed to disclose its donors online and noted in the statement that it has a 'record of transparency that goes above what is required of U.S. charities.' 

The foundation has said its Clinton Global Initiative has improved the lives of 430 million people in 180 countries since 2005.

The foundation stopped raising money from foreign governments in 2009 when Hillary became Obama's secretary of state amid concerns over a conflict of interest. 

However, once Hillary left the post in 2013 this embargo was dropped and the foundation began its endowment push to provide 'long-term stability'. 

A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Michael Short, said the 'alarming rate at which these contributions are now coming in presents a massive conflict of interest problem.'

The charity stopped accepting foreign donations at the request of Obama officials while Hillary was secretary of state, but started again with a $250million endowment drive after she left the post in 2013
