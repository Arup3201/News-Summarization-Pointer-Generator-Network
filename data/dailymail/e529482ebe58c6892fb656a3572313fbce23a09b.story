A man has been arrested on suspicion of firearms offences after reports that a gunman fired shots at school groundsmen this lunchtime.

Dorset Police confirmed the 26-year-old was detained close to Highcliffe School in Christchurch, near Bournemouth, following the incident shortly after midday.

The school was placed on temporary lockdown, with staff and children kept inside the building for their own safety. No one was injured in the incident and air pellets have been found at the scene. 

Children and staff were locked in at Highcliffe School in Christchurch, Dorset after reports of gunshots

Armed police were rushed to the scene after fencing workers at the school reported being shot at

Four fencers were working at the front of the school when a shot was allegedly fired and a pellet is said to have hit one of the men on the leg.

The workers  told the school  and the police were called. The school was then put on lockdown for 20 minutes while police investigated.

Grant Lavery from RM Smith Fencing Ltd said: 'I was just putting up the fence when I felt something hit me on the leg and I saw the pellet bounce off.

'It didn't hurt, it must have been a weak pellet gun. If he had a decent one it would've hurt.'

A police spokesman said earlier: 'Police were called at 12.06pm to reports that an air weapon had been fired at groundsmen working on fencing surrounding Highcliffe School in Christchurch.

'Police officers including armed response units are conducting a search of the area.

'Dorset Police would like to reassure parents there is no risk to the children at the school, who are being kept in the school building.' 

Groundsman Grant Lavery said he was shot at and told school authorities, sparking the security alert

An hour later, the force tweeted: 'One man arrested on suspicion of firearm related offences near to the scene. Would like to thank you all for your co-operation.'

In a statement on its website, the school said: 'There is no need for parents or students to be alarmed. Students are completely safe.' 

A teenager, believed to have been at the school this morning, tweeted: 'There's a man outside Highcliffe school with a gun! Police have cornered off the roads and I'm generally a bit worried.

'This is Highcliffe, since when are there people running around with gun.'

Headmaster, Patrick Earnshow, wrote on the school's website: 'There is no need for parents or students to be alarmed. Students are completely safe.'

Police said they arrested a 26-year-old man shortly after arriving at the scene and finding gun pellets
