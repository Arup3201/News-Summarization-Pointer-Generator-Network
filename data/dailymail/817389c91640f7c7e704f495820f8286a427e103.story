Hannah Graham's parents have issued an emotional plea for help to find their daughter as police have found no trace of the 18-year-old more than three weeks after she went missing.

Sue Graham thanked authorities for their efforts that have seen Jesse Matthew, the last person seen with Hannah on September 13, charged with abduction.

But despite a large-scale investigation by multiple agencies and thousands of citizens, their daughter is still missing.

Missing: Hannah Graham, 18, went missing on September 13 and police have found no trace of her since

'Somebody listening to me today either knows where Hannah is, or knows someone who has that information,' Mrs Graham said today sitting beside her husband John, holding back tears.

'We appeal to you to come forward and tell us where Hannah can be found.'

Two weeks ago, John Graham addressed the media, tearfully describing the 'nightmare' of not knowing where their only daughter is.

Wearing badges with her daughter's face, Mrs Graham said today: 'John has already said that this is every parent's worst nightmare.

'That is true, but it is also a nightmare for our son, James, for Hannah's grandparents and other members of our family, as well as for all of Hannah's many friends here in Charlottesville and beyond.'

She then implored anyone with information that has yet to be shared to call the police: 'Please, please, please help end this nightmare for all of us. Please help us to bring Hannah home.' 

'Someone knows': Mrs Graham launched a direct appeal to someone listening who knows where she is

Nightmare: They thanked the thousands of strangers, friends and relatives that have supported them so far

A $100,000 reward has been offered by the University of Virginia and the city of Charlottesville, Hannah's hometown, for information that leads to the university student's return.

Police have received thousands of tips, Mrs Graham informed reporters, expressing thanks from the family.

She added: 'We would also like to thank the many, many kind people who have supported our family during this terrible ordeal through words, deeds, thoughts and prayers.'

Matthew has been charged with abduction with intent to defile 18-year-old Hannah Graham, who disappeared after a night out with friends. 

He has also been linked to the murder of Alexis Murphy, 17, who was last seen in Nelson County, Virginia, on August 3, 2013. He has not been charged in the case, for which another man was found guilty.

Matthew was scheduled to appear in court Thursday on the abduction charge and reckless driving charges after authorities said he sped away from a police station Sept. 20. The cases were postponed until December.

Matthew was arrested in Texas last week after fleeing Virginia when police tried to question him in the disappearance of the 19-year-old University of Virginia student.

The UVA nurses's assistant was the last person seen with Graham the night she went missing from downtown Charlottesville.

Now investigators are looking into Matthew's movements over the last 12 years, focusing in on the more than six months he attended Christopher Newport University when two other young women disappeared without a trace.

No trace: Search teams have been patrolling the area for more than three weeks, even using drones

Matthew transferred to the Newport News school after being kicked out of Liberty University in Lynchburg in 2002 following allegations of rape.

He attended CNU from January 2003 before dropping out the following October. During that time, two local women went missing and were never found again.

Autumn Wind Day, 24, was last seen shopping at the Food Lion grocery store two miles from campus when she disappeared on July 24, 2003.

Less than two months later, 31-year-old Sophie May Rivera went missing after leaving her home located seven miles from CNU. Matthew left the CNU football team five days after Rivera vanished, and dropped out of school a month later. 

Local police are now reopening the two cold cases to see if Matthew may have been involved.
