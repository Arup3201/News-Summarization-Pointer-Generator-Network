Max Verstappen was left red faced on Sunday after crashing on his first public Formula One outing.

Verstappen, 16, will become the youngest driver in the sport's history after signing a deal with Toro Rosso for the 2015 campaign.

But the Dutchman's career got off to an alarming start after losing control of the 2011 Red Bull, which Sebastian Vettel claimed the second of his four consecutive titles in, during a demo run in Holland on Sunday.

Big news: Verstappen has caused quite a stir after signing to become the youngest ever driver in F1 next year

Prodigy: The teenager won't be old enough for a regular road licence in his native Holland by the 2015 season

Verstappen, the son of Jos Verstappen, who made more than 100 grands prix appearances, was performing a series of doughnuts in front of his home crowd.

But after coming unstuck near a barrier and being pushed away by the marshals, he then, rather embarrassingly, went head-on into the opposing barrier sustaining damage to his front wing and drawing ironic cheers from the crowd.

Verstappen, who turns 17 in September, won't be able to apply for a regular road licence in his native Holland, when he takes to the grid for next season's opener in Australia.

He will partner Daniil Kvyat, 20, at Toro Rosso after replacing Frenchman Jean-Eric Vergne.
