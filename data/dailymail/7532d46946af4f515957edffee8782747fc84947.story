Angel di Maria showed he knows where the goal is as he took part in United's training session on Friday prior to this weekend's clash against neighbours City.

The club's record £60million summer signing was spotted resting against a small-sided goal during boss Louis van Gaal's session at the Red Devils' Aon Training Complex.

Di Maria was joined by Robin van Persie and the  duo of Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick - who have been absent from the first-team picture through suspension and injury.

Club captain Rooney looked in a particular determined mood as he aims to fire United to victory against their bitter rivals following a three-match ban for kicking out at West Ham's Stewart Downing during September's Premier League encounter.

The 29-year-old has scored more Manchester derby goals than anyone else, having found the net 11 times in 22 appearances so far.

The Etihad is a particularly happy hunting ground for the England striker with seven of his derby goals coming there – including his last five.

Former United great Andrew Cole expects Rooney to take out his pent-up frustration on Manuel Pellegrini's side after missing the last three league matches.

'He has got to be raring to go,' Cole said. 'He is a professional footballer. When you miss games through injury or illness or suspension, you are going to be disappointed.

'I have no doubt he will be chomping at the bit now and ready to go having missed three games.

'It's going to be a massive boost to have a player of his quality back. Hopefully we can go to Man City and get a positive result.' 

Rooney's experience of Manchester derbies will be vital in helping the club's new faces know what awaits them at the Etihad.

Van Gaal, who is also facing City for the first time, could field up to six players who have not played in a Manchester skirmish before.

But Cole is sure the likes of Di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Ander Herrera will not freeze under pressure against a City team that will be itching to take all the points following a three-match winless streak.

'They are professional footballers. They have nothing to be scared of,' added Cole, who also spent a year at City before he retired.

'They are playing in front of 70,000 every other weekend and those players have played in big games like European matches and internationals before.

'They will not be thinking, "I am going to be worried about playing in the Manchester derby." They will appreciate it.'
