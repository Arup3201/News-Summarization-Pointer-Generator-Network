It is a world away from the peaceful entertainment of the tidy green bowling lawn.

Here, workers busy themselves at buzzing machinery and hurry between racks glinting with a vast array of jewelled colours.

This is the Thomas Taylor Bowls factory in Glasgow, where the game begins.

Brightly coloured balls are shaped, polished and rolled down ramps for testing before being used in play across the globe.

Expert design: Rough edges are sanded off using a computer-controlled lathe and the balls are rolled down a ramp to test how they curve

Weapons of choice: The bowls come in a cast array of beautiful colours, including 'mulberry', 'raspberry ripple' and even 'flame'

It is a superpower in the world of lawn green and crown green bowls.

More than 12.8million different 
variations of bowls are produced in the small factory, which employs 52 
staff, most of whom have worked at the plant for decades.

The factory, in Bernard Street, Bridgeton, was founded by the Taylor family in 1796, and bought by current owners the Herons in 1992.

Since then, they have made it their mission to insert a bit of colour into an otherwise monotone bowling world.

Although there are many black bowls 
lying on racks, what draws the eye are rows and rows of pretty shades 
from 'mulberry', 'raspberry ripple' to 'flame'.

Anne Dunwoodie, a bowls star and manager at the company said: 'It is like walking into a candy sweet shop - like someone has opened a tube of Smarties and it exploded everywhere.'

Managing director Grant Heron, 37, took over from his dad, Alex, 69, when he retired.

Formerly a mechanical engineer, he takes a very hands-on approach to the business, and is able to use all the machinery.

He said: 'We feel a great sense of history and a responsibility to keep as much industry in the UK as we can.

'We
don't want Britain to be a service country. I am proud of the 
engineering history of Glasgow and I want it to continue that.'

Bespoke products: Each bowl is hand-painted after being engraved with an emblem such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the English Rose

Made in Scotland: Each Taylor Ace bowl is carefully inspected for chips, cracks or defects and its bias is checked

Blue is the colour: A lathe crafts the distinctive shape of the ball

In
1998, they began producing the famous coloured bowls - but came up 
against opposition from their main importer, Australia, who banned the 
use of them.

But after the Scottish team playing Down Under refused to use any other bowls except their lucky blue ones, the ban was lifted and now green, pink, blue, orange and custom colour bowls are used worldwide.

In 1999, the rules for Flat Green bowls were changed by the World Bowls Board, to allow for the inclusion of coloured bowls.

The first stage in manufacturing is 
'compression moulding', where melamine - a hard plastic-like material - 
arrives in powder form in brown bags.

The melamine, which is also used in kitchen worktops, is weighed out and melted into a dough in an enormous oven.

It
is then packed into moulds and heated to 130C until it turns into a 
'treacle-like' liquid, before being pressed under a 150-ton weight.

Each
bowl is left to cool for 12 hours before the shaping stage, in which 
any rough edges left from the mould are sanded off on a 
computer-controlled lathe.

A two-pronged sanding machine then puts indentations for the grips on to the bowls using diamonds.

The bowl is then weighed and rolled down a ramp on to a slate bed 'Test Table' to check the bias.

Rock and roll: More than 12.8million different variations of bowls are produced in the small factory

The bowls are then washed for 45 minutes in a massive vibrating vat with water, detergent and silicon pyramids.

They are polished by 22-inch rotating mops in batches of 60, in a room covered in thick dust.

Many of the machines in the factory have been purpose-built using parts from other machines. The polishing machine, bought in 1982, was previously used to polish Tefal pans in the 1960s.

Finally, the balls are inspected for chips, cracks and defects and engraved with one of 4500 different emblems, such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the English Rose, and stamped with a 'Made in Scotland' signature.

Each one is then painted by hand, inspected again and packed up for shipping and sale.

A set of four of the coloured bowls sells for around Â£200, and can be shipped to any of 97 countries all over the world.

Father-of-two Mr Heron, whose sister Vicky Goldie is sales director at Taylor Bowls, is very proud of the factory, the workers and the bowls they produce and always on the look out for new ideas.

He said: 'In my opinion we make the best bowls in the world, but there is always room for improvement.'
