A dazzling white smile is a prerequisite
for any celebrity hoping to make it to the red carpet: they don't 
call it a Hollywood smile for nothing.

But not every A-lister in Britain is keen to buy into the trend for the blinding white fake teeth that have become so prevalent in the showbiz world today - and motormouth Jeremy Clarkson is one of them.

The Top Gear presenter has been voted as having the worst celebrity teeth in the UK after a poll was carried out to discover which famous face had the most discoloured teeth.

Racing behind Clarkson in second position was BBC politics presenter Andrew Marr, followed by QI presenter Stephen Fry, then as actress Helena Bonham Carter and funny man Matt Lucas.

According to the women polled, brown or yellow teeth are the biggest turn off when it comes to making an impression on a first date.

Over half of the women surveyed said they wouldn’t go for a second date with a man with badly discoloured teeth.

LoveLite co-owner Donnamarie McBride, who conducted the survey, said: 'If you want to make a good impression there’s nothing better than a winning smile and you can’t have that if you’ve got badly discoloured teeth. Clearly that counts for celebrities just as much as everyone else.

'It’s hardly a surprise a heavy smoker like Jeremy Clarkson came top. Smoking is one of the worst things you can do to stain and discolour your teeth.'

Although Simon Cowell has paid a lot of money for his dazzling white teeth he was still voted as having the worst cosmetic smile while Stephen Fry topped the list of bad celebrity smiles for his yellow teeth

It wasn't only tan-toothed stars that were drawing criticism though. The survey also revealed that too much cosmetic work can be as much of a turn off as too little.

Top of the list of celebrities who had over-cooked their teeth was X Factor supremo Simon Cowell, who had extra bright veneers done in Los Angeles.

Other cosmetic dentistry failures were Joey Essex, Katie Price, Chloe Simms, and Jodie Marsh.
