It may look like a tranquil walk across a beautiful lake, but for one daredevil climber and sportsman this was no country stroll.

In stark contrast to the perfectly clam waters of Green Lake, Austria, extreme sport champion Mich Kemeter struggled to stay focused as he edged along 250m of slackline.

But after 35 attempts the Austrian-born adventurer finally made it to the other end, breaking his own world record for 'waterlining'.

Mich Kemeter, 24, walked 250m - the same distance as three football fields  - across Lake Green in Austria, beating his previous record of 222m

The record attempt took 20 days to complete including one time which saw Mich make it to within just 6 metres of the finish before he lost his balance

To complete the walk Mich had to hold his arms horizontal for up to half and hour at a time, causing him agony as his muscles burned in pain

The challenge he set himself, to walk the length of three football pitches suspended only by a strip of canvas, tested his mental and physical capabilities to the limits.

Holding his arms in a horizontal position for half an hour at a time put the athlete in intense pain as his shoulder and bicep muscles started burning.

He also had to stay focused on the other end of the line for balance, while knowing that at any second a slight gust of wind could send him tumbling.

On one attempt he made it to within 6 meters of the finish before losing his balance and falling into the water.

Easy does it: Mich said the biggest problems were wind and weather conditions which had to be perfect to stand a chance of completing the walk

Serene: Mich said that while on the line he felt connected with nature in the fantastic setting in Austria, near to where he grew up

Extreme: Mich (pictured far right) is also a world renowned free solo climber and basejumper who has climbed a 1000ft sheer cliff with no safety harness

But eventually, 20 days after his first attempt and watched along by family and sports enthusiasts, Mich finally reached the other side.

He said: 'It is an incredible feeling to break your own record. The 
biggest issue is the wind and the weather conditions - you have to wait 
to make it as perfect as possible for the actual walk.

'You have to focus and you have to be really patient and accept certain circumstances.'

'But the water was beautiful, the sun was shining and the lake 
was reflecting like a mirror. The whole thing was pure, like the water. I
 felt really connected with nature, its energy and spirit.'

The successful crossing came on the day Mich had set as the last one to break his record, as worsening weather and shortening daylight would have put the record out of reach.

Mich, who is also a world-class free solo climber and
 basejumper, added: 'My cousin and his girlfriend were there on the last day and those guys 
were just screaming at me for the last few metres - saying "come on, you
 can do it".'

'It helped me so much because I hadn't see those people for quite a long time and they gave me so much of their good spirit.'

Mich now plans to break the record by 10m a year every year for the rest of his life meaning he will have to walk 400m when he turns 40

By
 crossing the line, Mich smashed his own 2012 waterline record of 222m, 
which he set at the same stunning location, where he also grew up.

He
 now plans to continue breaking his record each year by 10m for every 
year of his life - meaning he will have to walk 400m by the time he is 
40.

Mich, nicknamed the 'Austrian Daredevil', has always prided 
himself on pushing and opening up new levels in extreme sports and has a
 total of six records in slacklining disciplines.

Some of his other extreme achievements include 
climbing 1000ft up a sheer gorge in the Grand canyon du Verdon in the 
south of France without a safety rope and scaling 45 floors of the 
tallest building in the city of Changsha in China - again without 
equipment.
