The fatal shooting, where two people died and five were injured, took place at 2am Sunday night at a party down this road in Hope Mills, about ten miles southwest of Fayetteville

The sheriff's office has identified the dead as 32-year-old Tanishia Graham and 21-year-old Izaak Bridges.

'In our house, we can hear the partying in the bathroom on the back side of the house,' neighbour Nikita McCray, told NBC station WNCN of Raleigh.
