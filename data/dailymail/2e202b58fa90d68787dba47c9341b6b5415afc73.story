A grandmother from Kent has completed a gruelling 1,460 mile run across South Africa for charity.

During the ultra run, Mimi Anderson, 52, had to pull on her trainers every morning for 32 consecutive days and run through challenging terrain.

Her journey followed the Freedom Trail, an off-road route starting in Pietermaritzburg and finishing in Paarl, just outside Cape Town. 

Mimi was joined on the epic journey by Australian ultra runner Samantha Gash, 29, and their route took them over mountains, across rivers and through private game reserves full of wild animals including leopards, rhinos and wildebeests. 

Two generations united in one cause: Mimi Anderson, 52, left, and Samantha Gash, 29, ran 56 marathons back to back for charity

Along with a support crew, the pair had to navigate their own way to complete the challenge that involved running a total of 56 marathons back-to-back.

Speaking after completing the 32-day run, Mimi told MailOnline how difficult it had been thanks to the conditions.

She said: 'There are sections along the route where tracks simply don't exist, so we would find ourselves going through thorn bushes, crawling in the undergrowth and at one point even walking down a river as it was easier than trying to trudge through seven feet high thick reeds.

'During the first week we climbed to the highest point along the route of 2,700m above sea level, the wind was so strong that we nearly got blown off our feet, but the views from the top were worth the long tough 8k climb up, it was like standing on top of the world.

'At one point we got to the top of a very high hill and it looked as though the only way down was to fly. Thankfully we discovered an extremely rocky, very steep decent down to the valley floor, in places we were on our bottoms in order to continue down.'

She added: 'On the last day it took us six hours to do 10k, the terrain was nothing but rocks, very steep ascents and decents, climbing down waterfalls to get back down to the river, fighting our way through dense undergrowth and finishing with a very steep climb out of the valley, again at points having to use our hands for help.'

Gruelling: The challenge involved scaling mountains and running on uneven terrain. Pictured with Mimi, centre, and Samantha, right, is another of their support crew, Callum Stowell, left

Mimi is no stranger to distance running having completed ultra races including the Marathon Des Sables, Badwater Ultra and Comrades Marathon (she did 'the double' at the latter two by turning around and running the route back as soon as she finished).

She also holds the World Record for the fastest crossing of Ireland on foot and fastest time run by a female from Land's End to John O'Groats.

But despite her many accomplishments, Mimi said her latest challenge was 'one of the hardest things she has ever done.'

Speaking about why she wanted to do it, she said: 'Running an average of 80km per day for 32 days isn't something to be taken lightly and technical running isn't my forte.

'But I believe that in order to grow as a person we all need to do things that take us way out of our comfort zone, each time pushing just that little bit further – this project will push me further than I have ever pushed myself before, in many ways.'

Mimi and Samantha put themselves though the long-distance run with the support of NGO Save The Children Australia in order to raise money for girls and women in South Africa. So far they have raised 40,494 Australian dollars (£22,000).

'Both of us felt that if we were to take on a challenge as big as this we wanted to raise money to help South African girls and women. Samantha is 29 and I'm 52, two women, two generations and two pairs of legs supporting others,' Mimi said.

They are aiming to raise awareness and funds to set up of a social enterprise business in the Free State of South Africa that will employ a dozen South African women to make re-usable sanitary pads in order to keep girls in education. The pair were shocked at how many girls are missing out on school because of a lack of adequate sanitary products.

Mimi explained: 'Once they reach puberty, one in three South African girls miss out on four or five days of school per month because they cannot afford to buy sanitary pads. Instead they stay at home and use anything from old rags and rolled up newspapers - anything they can get their hands on. Eventually they drop out of school altogether.'

The grandmother-of-three said thinking of the charity kept her pushing on when the going got tough during the run.

Despite the gruelling nature of the event, she was delighted to finish without sustaining any injuries. 

She said: 'Luckily for me I had no real issues apart from a small blister on my left foot, my 52 year old body held up really well!'
