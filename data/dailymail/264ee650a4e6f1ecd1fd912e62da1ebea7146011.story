A Manhattan banking bigwig has accused his ex-wife of trying to make their 16-year-old son gay 'to get back at him.'

New York real estate broker Danica Cordell-Reeh has asked a judge for total decision-making power over her son after her estranged ex-husband Henry Owsley allegedly complained of her manipulation to the boy's California boarding school administrators.

The revelation is the latest in a string of dramatic episodes between the former high school sweethearts that began with their divorce ten years ago when Owsley falsely accused Cordell-Reeh of molesting their children.

More recently, Owsley hauled his ex back into court alleging she's stolen $263,000 from him by charging for nanny services she never received.

A hearing has been set for September to discuss the newest accusations.

Cordell-Reeh's attorney says Owsley told the the boy's school that his ex-wife was forcing their children to have seances to summon a dead relative and that she's 'trying to make her son gay in order to get back at him.'

A separate attorney representing the boy told the New York Post that he's 'trying to find himself.'

Owsley, now CEO of boutique investment bank The Gordon Group, is already suing ex-wife Cordell-Reeh for nearly $3 million – the $263,000 he says she stole and another $2.5 million in punitive damages, according to court documents.

Their 2000 separation agreement required Owsley to reimburse his former spouse for nanny expenses for the couple’s twins, as well as child support, private school tuition and health care, the New York Daily News reported.

Owsley abided by the agreement despite being told by his children there was hardly ever a caretaker around, according to the suit.

Two years ago Owsley claims Cordell-Reeh spent nearly $180,000 given to her for a nanny without ever having hired one.

Cordell-Reeh’s attorney told the Daily News he was ‘quite surprised.

‘Her children are turning 18 in January, and he wants to get involved in 10 more years of litigation.’
