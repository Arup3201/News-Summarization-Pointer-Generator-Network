The man who managed to escape a 75-minute carjacking by the Boston Marathon bombers and then lead to police to their whereabouts has spoken out on the anniversary of the attacks, telling of the 'incredible' 12 months he has endured and how he dealt with the ordeal.

Now 27, the Chinese-American entrepreneur - who has chosen to be identified only as 'Danny' for personal security reasons - says he refuses to accept the 'hero' title he has been given, telling The Boston Globe he only ever thought about 'trying to save myself'.

One year ago today - three days after two pressure bombs blasted through the finish line at the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring over 260 others - Danny pulled over his Mercedes SUV on Brighton Avenue about 10pm to reply to a text message he had recieved, when a car pulled up behind him.

In the car were Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarneav, with Tamerlan foircing his way into Danny's vehicle.

Hero: Chinese-American entrepreneur Danny speaks out about the one-year anniversary of his carjacking ordeal at the hands of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarneav

Suspects: Dzhokhar, left, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, right, hijacked the driver's car in Boston on the evening of April 18 (the brothers pictured on April 15 just moments before the Marathon blast

He told Danny he was responsible for the bombings and for killing a police officer, and to drive.

At first Tamerlan demanded cash, with Danny handing over his wallet and the $45 cash in his car.

Tamerlan continued to demand Danny drive, taking him into an area of Watertown, where they eventually stopped in a dark street.

Dzhokhar pulled up behind them and started moving equipment from his car into Danny's.

Tamerlan then ordered Danny into the backseat, with the brothers taking control of the car.

They stopped nearby at an ATM, where Danny was forced to withdraw $800.

As they were speaking in Russian, Danny couldn't understand what they were saying, but thought he heard them say 'Manhattan', and figured they were heading to New York.

However his car had hardly any gas in it, so the brothers took the car back to Cambridge, stopping at a Shell service station on Memorial Drive.

The station only accepted cash, so as Dzhokhar went inside to pay and Tamerlan configured the GPS, Danny made a daring escape.

He ran, as fast as he could, straight across the street to another gas station, where he pleaded with the attendent to call 911.

Police arrived within minutes, and he told them he could track his car using its onboard satellite system.

Within 20 minutes, authorities ghad the Mercedes back in Watertown, where an explosive standoff left Tamerlan dead, with Dzhokhar driving over his brother's body in Danny's car to escape.

It wasn't long before before Dzhokhar was found hiding in a wrapped boat in Waterdown.

'I'm still the same person,' Danny says now.

'Even though this happened to me, it doesn't change anything.

'Somethimes when I look back, I feel it's not my story, it's like it's somebody else's story.'

Danny said at first he struggled to focus on anything other than this ordeal, but quickly resumed his routines as normal.

'I hope this story encourages some people,' he said. 

'When [someone] is in a dangerous or difficult situation, you can still have opportunity. Just don’t give up.'

He waited until May to tell his mother what happened, worried that she would make him move home.

'I told her, ‘Mom, it’s OK, I’m safe now, don’t be worried, because they have those two guys,’ he said. 

‘One is dead and one is [in] custody, so they’re not able to hurt me again. And people here are so nice, so helpful.’ 

Still, Danny struggles with the hero tag.

'From my point, the definition of a hero is someone willing to sacrifice himself for somebody else,' he said. 

'I don’t know, I was trying to save my own life.'

He does admit, however, being brave enough to go the Marathon on Monday, content with being just another face in the crowd. 

'The Marathon is a wonderful thing,' he said. 

'A positive thing.'
