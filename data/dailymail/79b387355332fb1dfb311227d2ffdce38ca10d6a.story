Unleashing the free market: Influential lobbyist Robert Walker has suggested that future Nasa missions could be sponsored by private companies

The next rover built to explore the surface of Mars could be plastered with branding by companies more associated with Formula 1, an influential lobbyist has suggested.

Robert Walker, a former congressman who now lobbies for Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates, outlined the audacious plan in testimony to Congress.

He said Nasa should seek out sponsorship from private firms to help fund its missions, much in the same way that motor racing teams festoon their cars with the branding of corporate backers.

'The sponsorships there pay for 
operations costing $200-$300 million a year. That's enough for a whole 
space flight,' Mr walker told the House Science, Space & Technology 
Committee.

He added: 'When 
the Go Daddy rover is traversing Martian terrain, we will be more 
solidly on our way to fulfilling our destiny in the stars.'

In his testimony to Congress last month, Mr
Walker, a Republican who chaired the House Science Committee from 1995 
to 1997, saidÂ  Nasa must behave like an entrepreneur to continue to 
succeed in the realm of space exploration.

The
scheme is similar to the way in which sports stadia sell naming rights 
to large corporations - for example Arsenal play at the Emirates 
stadium, named for the Middle East based airline.

In
the same way, companies would bid to have their names and logos put on 
various Nasa space vehicles, like Mars rovers, the future Orion Multi 
Purpose Crew Vehicle and even, if partners agree, the International 
Space Station.

'Would 
anything in science, aeronautics of exploration be harmed if names were 
attached to the particular missions and they were sponsored?' Mr Walker 
asked. 'I can't imagine why.

'These sponsorship dollars could be structured to remain outside the appropriations process, increasing the amounts of money available to Nasa and, at the same time, avoiding to some extent the annual appropriations cycle.'
