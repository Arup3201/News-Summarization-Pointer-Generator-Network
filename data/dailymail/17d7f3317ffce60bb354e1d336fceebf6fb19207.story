Conman: Aaron Beaird reportedly made $6million from his life insurance deception, pictured on Businessinsider.com

An insurance fraudster who made $6million ripping off his own family and members of his church before faking suicide is facing jail today.

Father-of-three Aaron Travis Beaird, 39, from Enumclaw, Washington, targeted mostly his friends and family in the con which lasted ten years, the Seattle Post Intelligencer reports

The life insurance salesman skimmed money from what clients paid him. He then doctored documents to back up his crime and redirected the companies correspondence to a PO Box he owned.

On being discovered he feigned his suicide – abandoning his car by a waterfront and sending farewell notes to all of his clients. He actually fled to Scotland for a week.

Federal prosecutors say he deserves a six-year sentence for his crime. He is expected to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Ricardo Martinez later this afternoon.

‘Mr. Beaird is the worst of thieves,’ one victim said in a letter to the court, according to the newspaper. ‘He has stolen from the elderly, a widow, the blind, his family, and his wife’s family. He has stolen from trusted friends.’

‘I considered Travis a very trusted and loyal friend and adviser,’ another woman wrote. “He took everything my husband and I worked our entire life to build. He left me broke at 61, a distraught widow.’

‘This whole situation has been like a kick in the gut for me,’ another said in a letter. “I find that I have kind of lost the spark in my life.’

‘Travis Beaird is a predator,’ another victim said. “He was a personal friend, and betrayed all the trust that was given to him.’

Beaird, a church leader, also tricked members of the congregation leaving many of his backers broke and distraught – one victim has been forced to live in a trailer after losing their fortune.

The college dropout managed to get away with it for a decade but pushed his luck in 2011 when he tried to collect $500,000 on a man’s life insurance by claiming he had died when he hadn’t. It was discovered by the insurance company.

As the extent of Beaird’s deception became clear, the broker faked his own suicide – leaving his car abandoned near a local waterfront called Deception Pass, according to the local report.

He actually took a taxi to a nearby airport and took a flight to Scotland.

He was arrested after flying back to Seattle a week later and on his return he pleaded guilty to FBI investigators.

His defense lawyers claimed he invested much of the money in other businesses but his attempts fell apart when they went under.

'Unfortunately, none of the many companies he started proved successful as he lacked any real business experience and simply had too many projects going to manage them all,' defense attorney Nancy Tenney told the court.

'Mr. Beaird has lost his professional license, his business, his wife, all material assets, as well as his reputation.

They are calling for a shorter prison sentence.

The victims are unlikely to see their money returned as Beaird has spent around $5.7million of his stolen wealth.

In a letter to court he said: 'I had everything going for me in life, such high hopes, a beautiful family and good intentions. ‘Not a day goes by that I haven’t wished I could go back and make things right.'
