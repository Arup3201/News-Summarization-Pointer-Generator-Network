An expectant mother given just 24 hours to live after being diagnosed with an extremely rare cancer is now running marathons after making a 'miracle recovery'.

Michaela Cotterill was 34 weeks pregnant with her first baby, Maesie-Claire, when she started coughing up blood.

Dangerously ill, doctors diagnosed her with post-partum chorio-carcenoma - an extremely rare cancer which grows from the cells of the placenta.

But after giving birth to her daughter in
 2008, Ms Cotterill slowly recovered and has since had her second 
child, Lucas in February.

Now the mother-of-two is in training, preparing to tackle the Great North Run to raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust - the charity that supported her during her illness.

The 27-year-old, of Rosewort, Stockton, said: 'I want to give something back to the charity that helped me.

When Ms Cotterill fell ill, the cancer, which grew primarily in her placenta, spread quickly to her lungs.

By the time she was diagnosed, doctors gave her 24 hours to live and her consultant said she was 
the most dangerously ill patient he had seen in 20 years.

Diagnosis is based on levels of a pregnancy hormone called HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin).

Ms Cotterill's levels of the hormone were by far the highest that Barry Hancock, professor of clinical oncology, had ever seen.

Choriocarcinoma is an extremely rare form of cancer, which grows from the cells of the placenta.

It is often diagnosed following a molar pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion or ectopic pregnancy, when any placental tissue left behind, continues to grow despite the absence of a foetus.

It is very rare, only affecting around one in every 50,000 pregnancies.

Choriocarcinoma is most often found in women over the age of 40.

Symptoms include:

Although very rare, the cancer responds extremely well to chemotherapy and radiation treatments. It has a cure rate of around 90 per cent.

'I was taken to the cancer hospital in
 Sheffield and when Maesie was born they took her away for two hours for
 tests - the longest two hours of my life.

'But they came back fine, and in time I recovered. I lost my hair for six months. It was difficult, but I came through it.

'When
 I found out I was pregnant last year, I went for all the tests and 
everything was fine. The old worries came back, but everything went so 
well.

'Now I want to make as much money as I can for the Teenage Cancer Trust.'

Ms Cotterill is taking part in the Great North Run with old school friend Sam Smith, 27.

'I hope to do it every year now. We've been trying to do some training, so hopefully I can manage it when it comes round,' she said.

Now six, Maesie-Claire is as happy and daring as any other little girl - so much so, her mother Ms Cotterill struggles to keep up.

'She's my miracle child,' said Ms Cotterill. 'She loves school, and she is part of the swimming club at Billingham. She dives into the pool off the middle board and I can't even face watching her.'
