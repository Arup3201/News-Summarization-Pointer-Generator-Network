A farmer’s £2million home was sold to his brother for a fraction of its value after a solicitor forged his signature on land deeds, his family claimed last night.

The solicitor confessed to police that he had faked the signature of Thomas Evans on the sale of his 485-acre farm and was charged with fraud.

But days before the lawyer was due to appear in court he was found drowned and the criminal case was dropped as a consequence.

However, it has led to a bitter feud between the children of farmer Thomas Evans, who died in November 2009, and their uncle Dafydd Evans, who with his wife Mair bought the farm near Dolgellau, North Wales, shortly before his brother’s death.

Thomas Evans’s daughter Ceri Littler said her father was mentally ill and an alcoholic and so had no idea of the actions of his older brother in the sale of the farm.

‘He was a very poorly man, it’s horrendous and quite unbelievable,’ said Mrs Littler, 34, who claims the farm has since been valued at £2million.

Referring to the solicitor who allegedly forged her father’s signature, Gareth Evans (no relation), she added: ‘We have a transcript of Gareth Evans’s police confession and we know my father’s signature was definitely forged, but his brother refuses to acknowledge it was illegal. If it was legitimate, why was my father’s signature forged?

‘Nieces and nephews have been done out of their inheritance but my uncle won’t enter into any dialogue with us about it, so now we are waiting to hear from the Land Registry as to whether we can get it back. It is not about the money, it is about getting justice for my father and getting back what was rightfully his.’

Mrs Littler said she and her siblings Roslyn, 36, Jonathan, 30, and step-brothers Sion, 30, and Iwan, 19, realised there were problems with their father’s affairs after his death from liver problems aged 52 in 2009. They began looking into the sale of his farm, where he was born and raised, and employed forensic handwriting experts who proved the signature on Land Registry deeds, transferring the ownership of the farm to his brother in April 2009, were fake, before alerting police.

It is understood Dafydd Evans and his wife were questioned but never formally arrested and denied any wrongdoing. They refused to comment when contacted by the Daily Mail.

Even though the solicitor’s confession was handed to the Land Registry in February, it has so far refused to overturn the sale.

Mrs Littler said that if the sale was declared invalid, the money could be returned to her father’s estate and her uncle would then be entitled to claim compensation from the Land Registry, but ten months later they are still awaiting a decision.

Accountant Debbie Chatham, 54, Thomas Evans’s first wife and Mrs Littler’s mother, said: ‘The Land Registry have done everything they can to dodge our application and have been reluctant to admit they made a mistake.

‘Gareth Evans was in a position of trust and he totally abused that. It’s very frustrating. We’ve got such indisputable evidence. You can’t get much better evidence than a confession, but still nothing has been done.’

The body of solicitor Gareth Evans was found on Black Rock Sands after he allegedly admitted fraud to police

At an inquest into Gareth Evans’s death in July the coroner recorded an open verdict, saying he could not be certain the ‘devoted’ father of three had committed suicide.

Mr Evans, a former deputy high sheriff of Meirionnydd, had left for work as usual, asking his wife what was for supper, before his car was later found abandoned near a railway bridge. His body was found washed up near Porthmadog, 15 miles away.

At the time of his death his family said in a statement: ‘As far as the family is concerned, Gareth Evans is innocent and not guilty of any offence. No court has found him guilty of any crime. This is an allegation of fraud and has not been proven.’

They were also asked to comment on the alleged confession but did not respond.

A spokesman for North Wales Police said: ‘We can confirm that no one else has been arrested in connection with this case.’

A spokesman for the Land Registry said: ‘We are in contact with the solicitors representing Mr Thomas Evans’s children about their application regarding their clients’ claim to the property. This process has not been completed and we will continue to work with all parties to resolve the situation.’
