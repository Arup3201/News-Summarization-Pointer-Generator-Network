A Transportation Security Administration agent who unwittingly let two people board separate aeroplanes one with a loaded gun and the other with a knife has been sacked.

Both passengers were flying from Phoenix to London on June 22 and both took the weapons on board in their hand luggage.

Neither passenger was a terrorist or tried to use the items during the flight. Both weapons were found by security staff at Heathrow Airport as the passengers tried to transfer to connecting flights.

William Joseph Richardson was making his way to a flight from London to Paris when security staff found the loaded Glock in his hand luggage.

Police confiscated the gun and ammunition and held Richardson, 34, for further investigation. It was later revealed that he has a criminal record.

Seven hours later, airport security found the 3.9-inch folding knife on another passenger getting ready to board a connecting British Airways flight. The knife was confiscated.

TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein told FoxNews.com: ‘TSA employs multiple layers of security to protect the travelling public.

On board aircraft, these layers include reinforced cockpit doors, Federal Air Marshals, armed pilots and a vigilant public, as well as many others, both seen and unseen.’

A TSA official said that the agent responsible for the breach is no longer employed by the agency.

The TSA reports that approximately 1.8 million passengers and their luggage are screened every day for prohibited items including weapons and explosives.

The organisation uses imaging technology to safely screen passengers for any items which may be concealed under clothing, while Advanced Technology X-ray units screen all hand luggage.

The incidents came before Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson ordered that mobile phones with dead batteries would not be allowed on certain flights.
