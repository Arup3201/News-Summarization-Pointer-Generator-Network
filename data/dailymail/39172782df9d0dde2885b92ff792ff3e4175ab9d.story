The initial K is synonymous with the Kardashian clan. So following news that Kim is expecting her first baby with Kanye West, the world is already imagining what name the couple will choose.

Nameberry baby name expert, Pamela Redmond Satran, says that though Kim's sister Kourtney bucked the family trend, it is hard to imagine that she and Kanye will be able to resist a K name for their unborn child.

Indeed, on Keeping Up With The Kardashians last year, Kim even admitted she was calling dibs on her favorite K names.

Will it be another K name? Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are expecting their first child

Younger sister Khloe said in the episode: 'Kim is the only crazy person that would actually like, reserve. Lamar and I like baby names, but I'm not going to say, "No one else can have this name!"'

With Kim's leaning towards that letter in mind, Nameberry has compiled a list of suggested monikers, based on current baby name trends and the various worlds from which the couple may take inspiration.

Kassius or Kassia

Kanye’s former fashion stylist was a 19-year-old Yale undergrad named Cassius Clay - the white Cassius Clay - which might inspire the 
respelling of this Ancient Roman classic.

Cassius means hollow and 
recently reentered the Top 1000 for the first time since 1895; the 
similar girls’ name Cassia means cinnamon, which makes it perfect for 
this spicy couple.

Kauai, Kashmir, or Kyoto

Kimberly and Kanye are both place-names, and so the couple might want 
to consider another off-the-map place name, such as the Hawaiian Kauai, 
the Sanskrit Kashmire, or the Japanese Kyoto.

Kissa or Kito

Kanye is an African name, so it may make sense for the couple to look 
for another name of that origin.

Kissa is a Ugandan girls’ name that 
means 'born after twins', while Kito is Swahili for 'precious jewel'.

Kalista or Kalixto

The Kimye baby is sure to be gorgeous, and so one logical choice would 
be these female and male versions of the Greek name meaning 
'beautiful'.

While the K versions of the name modernize it Kardashian-style, there were three popes named Calixto and a mythological nymph as 
well as the name of actress Calista Flockhart giving weight to the trend.

Kadence, Kalliope or Kalypso

Music names! Kanye might want to wrap while Kim dances along to songs with musical names Kadence, Kalliope, or Kalypso.
