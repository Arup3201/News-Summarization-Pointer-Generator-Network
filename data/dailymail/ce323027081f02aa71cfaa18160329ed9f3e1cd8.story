A group of Florida men were arrested on Thursday night after one of them allegedly offered an undercover cop dressed as a prostitute $3 and a chicken dinner in exchange for sex.

A female investigator from the Sanford Police Department was dressed as a sex-worker in a sting operation in an effort to clean up the neighborhood when a group of men came driving by and began 'soliciting' her.

One of those men arrested on Thursday night was Steven Torres, 32, of Melbourne, Florida who allegedly yelled out at the decoy and offered her a mere $3 and some chicken dinner in exchange for sexual favors. He had a group of six rowdy 'wing men' with him who supposedly supported the endeavor.
