Tony Bellew has denied reports that he was involved in a bust-up while filming Rocky spin-off Creed in Pennsylvania.

It was alleged by American website TMZ that the Liverpool cruiserweight climbed out of the ring and started punching his on-screen corner man.

Sylvester Stallone, who is reprising his role as Rocky Balboa, was alleged to have broken the fight up before the police were called.

But Bellew told Sportsmail: ‘It’s nonsense. Nothing happened.’

The 32-year-old has been filming in America for several weeks after landing the role of Pretty Ricky.

The story centres on Adonis Creed, the son of Balboa’s former rival Apollo, who fights Ricky in the film. Creed takes up boxing against the wishes of his family and is trained by Balboa.
