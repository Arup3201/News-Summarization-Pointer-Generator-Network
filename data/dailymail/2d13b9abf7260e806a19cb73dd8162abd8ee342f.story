She may be known as Westminster's most embarrassing wife after posting a series of revealing 'cleavage selfies' on Twitter.

But Rochdale councillor Karen Danczuk, 31, dubbed 'Trampy Karen' at school, has said she is 'infuriated' by claims that she is a bad role model - as she posts another figure-hugging picture.

The mother-of-two, married to Labour MP Simon Danczuk, 48, whose book prompted the inquiry into historic child abuse allegations at Westminster, recently came head-to-head with Janet Street-Porter on Loose Women.

Rochdale councillor Karen Danczuk, dubbed 'Trampy Karen' at school, posted two more figure-hugging pictures yesterday showing her weight loss

The mother-of-two, 31, has said she is 'infuriated' by claims that she is setting a bad example for other women

She became embroiled in a discussion with the journalist who said she was setting a bad example to girls in Rochdale, where sex–trafficking gangs were convicted of abusing hundreds of girls in 2012.

'That just infuriated me her telling me how I should set an example for girls [she has] no idea what it's like to be…' Mrs Danczuk told the Daily Telegraph.

'They have no idea what my past is, and what the girls went through. No idea. I don't mind someone having a go at me, but don't blame child sex abuse on me because I happen to occasionally wear a low–cut top.

'If I want to walk down the street in a bikini, that doesn't excuse a group of disgusting men forming a paedophile ring. There are no excuses for those sick men. I will not be blamed for [their actions] because I happen to be comfortable in my skin.'

She became an internet sensation after posting dozens of revealing images on Twitter, like the ones above

The councillor posed for a picture in the splits after a drunken night out with a friend in the pub 

The mother-of-two became an internet sensation after posting a number of revealing shots on Twitter and even posed for a picture doing the splits in a pub.

She tweeted two photos yesterday revealing her weight loss with the caption: 'I'm still on track. This shirt used to be bursting open, now it's a perfect fit!'

The councillor revealed she was called 'Trampy Karen' at school and said she felt she could not let her down.

'I always knew I was going to change my life. They used to call me Trampy Karen, you know. And now I think of Trampy Karen, and I know I can't let her down. I can't fail, because of her,' she said.

Mrs Danczuk has been reluctant to talk about her childhood, but said she did not come from a stable, close family. 

She revealed she was called 'Trampy Karen' at school and felt she could not let her down now 

Mrs Danczuk said she may stand down as a Labour councillor at the next election and embrace a career in reality television – or the fire service

The councillor was recently named as among the bookies' favourites to be named the first elected mayor of Greater Manchester.

But Mrs Danczuk said she may stand down as a Labour councillor at the next election and embrace a career in reality television – or the fire service.

'I've become interested in the fire service. I've been working towards becoming a firefighter. They're letting me do a training exercise soon', she said.

The 'Queen of the Selfie' married her politician husband almost three years ago, two years after he was elected, and she wore a second–hand dress she bought off eBay for £10.

There is a 16–year age gap between them, but the councillor said she is not with him for the money and saved for the house they share.
