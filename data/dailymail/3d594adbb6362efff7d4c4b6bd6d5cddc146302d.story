Despite knowing he was dying, Steve Jobs worked for more than a year on the products that he believed would safeguard the company's future.

It was also revealed today that Jobs fought hard to get plans approved for a spaceship-style company headquarters in California.

It will be big enough to hold 12,000 employees in a park-like setting near the existing base in Cupertino. He appeared at a town council meeting in June to plead for the planning go ahead.

Visionary: Steve Jobs introducing the iPad2 in San Francisco on March 2 this year

Jobs had a part-time job working for Hewlett Packard at the site when he was 13 and he ensured Apple bought the land when it became available.

He has also been overseeing the development of the delayed iCloud project, which will allow Apple users to store their music, photos and other documents remotely and masterminding updated versions of the iPod, iPad, iPhone and MacBooks, ensuring at least four years’ worth of products are in the pipeline, according to Apple sources.

Pre-order sales of the first authorised biography of Steve Jobs increased by a staggering 44,000 per cent.

According to the official description, the book, out on October 24, is ‘based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs conducted over two years - as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues’.

Brand consultancy firm Interbrand predicted that Jobs death could actually boos the value of Apple by around $670million (£431million) from $33.5billion as fans make sympathy and impulse purchases.

Jobs died on Wednesday, aged 56, following a lengthy battle with pancreatic cancer.

Within minutes of his passing being confirmed, tributes had been paid by world leaders, the most famous technology bosses and fans throughout the world.

A day later, thousands continued to gather at shrines dedicated to Jobs from California to London, Sydney and Tokyo, Japan.

Well-wishers flocked to his home in California to leave flowers and cards, as his family mourned inside. Jobs is survived by a wife, a son and two daughters.

Devastated Apple staff, meanwhile, celebrated the life of their former boss with memorial services in his honour.

At Apple stores across the world and the company's headquarters, makeshift shrines quickly sprang up as Apple's legions of fans gathered together to remember the life of a man they revered as a hero.

'We are planning a celebration of Steve’s extraordinary life for Apple employees that will take place soon,' Apple chief executive Tim Cook said yesterday.

Global leaders from politics and business spoke out about how they had been inspired by the celebrated innovator.

Tributes, led by President Barack Obama, began pouring in within minutes of the company confirming Jobs's death.

'We are deeply saddened to announce that Steve Jobs passed away today,' read a statement by Apple's board of directors on Wednesday.

'Steve's brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives. The world is immeasurably better because of Steve.

'His greatest love was for his wife, Laurene, and his family. Our hearts go out to them and to all who were touched by his extraordinary gifts.'

The homepage of Apple's website switched to a full-page image of Jobs with the text, 'Steve Jobs 1955-2011.'

Clicking on the image revealed the additional text: 'Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being.

'Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor.

'Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.'

His relatives also released a statement, which said he 'died peacefully, surrounded by his family.

Returning to work: Apple employees arrive passing flags flying at half staff at the headquarters in Cupertino

An Arkansas couple who went to an Apple store to lay down flowers for Steve Jobs spotted the tail end of a burglary instead of a makeshift memorial.

Robert Blake and his girlfriend, Amy Parker, told The Associated Press that when they showed up at the suburban Little Rock store on Wednesday night, they didn't initially realise what they were witnessing.

Blake said he thought a man running away from the store was just a fellow mourner.

Then, he watched the man hop in a getaway car with another man and speed off.

Parker said she thought she could see other flowers left in honor of the man who founded and ran Apple. But she soon realised she was looking at broken glass.

So, Parker pulled out her iPhone and dialed 911.

Police say the two suspects made off with more than two dozen iPhones, plus iPads and laptops on Wednesday. Authorities had not made any arrests by Thursday evening.

Snapshots taken from surveillance tapes show a maroon car driving off from the store.

Parker and Blake said they own everything the suspects stole - plus iPods and an Apple TV.

'We both not only use the products every day,' she said, 'but both of our jobs are influenced every day by what he's done, too.'

Parker edits video for an education company and Blake is a web developer.

After the couple talked with police, they left a bouquet of white lilies at the store.

'In his public life, Steve was known as a visionary; in his private life, he cherished his family. We are thankful to the many people who have shared their wishes and prayers during the last year of Steve's illness.'

Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the news of Jobs's death to Apple employees via e-mail, in which he said: 'I have some very sad news to share with all of you. Steve passed away earlier today.

'No words can adequately express our sadness at Steve’s death or our gratitude for the opportunity to work with him. We will honour his memory by dedicating ourselves to continuing the work he loved so much.'

Within minutes of his death being confirmed, tributes to Jobs began flooding the web, led by President Barack Obama, who tweeted: 'Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. From all of us at #Obama2012, thank you for the work you make possible every day - including ours.'

Mr Obama later gave a fuller statement, in which he praised Jobs as a 'visionary' who was 'bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it'.

'The world has lost a visionary,' he said. 'And there may be no greater tribute to Steve’s success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented.

'Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to Steve’s wife Laurene, his family, and all those who loved him.'

He added: 'Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last. Because he did, he transformed our lives, redefined entire industries, and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history: he changed the way each of us sees the world.'

Steve Jobs' high school friend who founded Apple with him in his parents' garage wiped away tears as he paid tribute to the visionary genius.

Steve Wozniak, who helped start Apple in 1976, said he will miss his fellow co-founder 'as much as everyone.'

'We've lost something we won't get back,' Mr Wozniak said. 'The way I see it, though, the way people love products he put so much into creating means he brought a lot of life to the world.'

Social media sites were inundated with tributes from fans, with one of the most popular messages being that three apples changed the world: ‘The One that Eve ate, the one that dropped on Newton’s head and the one that Steve built.’
