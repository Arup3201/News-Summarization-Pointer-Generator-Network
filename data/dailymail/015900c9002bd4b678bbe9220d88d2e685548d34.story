Britain's counter-terror laws are 'no longer fit for purpose', leaving spooks and police unable to prevent attacks, a former MI5 chief has warned,

Lord Evans of Weardale said it is now 'much harder' than a decade ago for the authorities to access communications between terrorists and criminals, because they are discussing plots on platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Snapchat.

But Deputy PM Nick Clegg today again rejected the idea of retaining data about internet and social media use by 'every single man woman and child in this country for a year'.

Pressure for more powers for police and intelligence agencies has grown in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris, in which 17 people were killed.

Coalition tensions have been exposed after David Cameron demanded that social media and messaging sites open up their networks to the security services.

But Mr Clegg has blocked the idea of what he describes as a 'Snooper's Charter'.

In a rare intervention, Lord Evans warned national security depends on greater legal powers.

In an article for the Sunday Telegraph, Lord Evans said: 'The ability of the police and security agencies to do this important work of protecting our society and its vulnerable people is under threat from changing technology.

'We expect them today not just to follow up a crime or terrorist attack and identify the perpetrators but rather to do all they can to stop the attack or crime from taking place at all.

'They can only do this if they have the tools to do so and the tools at their disposal are no longer fit for purpose.'

Mr Clegg said he agreed with Lord Evans and the police that the state needs to 'retain the ability to intrude on the privacy' of such people.

But he said he is 'uncomfortable' with the idea of retaining data about internet and social media use by 'every single man woman and child in this country for a year'.

'It is a blanket approach to the retention of data of people who are innocent of any wrongdoing whatsoever,' he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show.

'It is not a very British thing to confer or imply guilt on the whole of the nation by retaining records of every website everyone has visited over the course of a year.'

Deputy PM Nick Clegg today again rejected the idea of retaining data about internet and social media use by 'every single man woman and child in this country for a year'.

Mr Clegg said the Snoopers' Charter plans were 'unproven, clunky, resource intensive'.

He went on: 'Lots of experts looked at it and said this is a waste of resources, a waste of time. Why are we keeping records of every man, woman and child across the country when for starters, we tend to know where to look for the people who want to do us harm?'

The Deputy Prime Minister said the aim was to 'find the needle without inferring guilt on the haystack'.

'New powers will need to be put on the statute book in the next parliament, and I will advocate them as much as any chisel-faced securocrat,' he went on.

'I want to keep us safe. It's ludicrous this idea that people who care about our freedom don't care about our safety.

'What I will not do... is saying that every single man, woman and child should have data about what they get up to online kept for a year.

On a visit to Washington on Friday David Cameron warned internet firms they must work with security agencies to stop their networks becoming a 'safe haven' for terrorists.

The Prime Minister used a press conference in the White House to insist the likes of Facebook and and WhatsApp cannot be used as a secret way for extremists to plot atrocities away from the glare of MI5 and the FBI.

Mr Cameron insists the security agencies must be able to intercept communications between extremists and terror suspects who use encrypted messaging services and social media sites to plot atrocities.

He said: 'I take a very simple approach to this, which is ever since we've been sending letters to each other or making telephone calls to each other or mobile phone calls to each other or, indeed, contacting each other on the internet, it has been possible in both our countries in extremis, in my country by signed warrant by the Home Secretary, to potentially listen to a call between two terrorists, to stop them in their activity.

'We're not asking for back doors. We have - we believe in very clear front doors through legal processes that should help to keep our country safe.

'And my only argument is that as technology develops, as the world moves on, we should try to avoid the safe havens that could otherwise be created for terrorists to talk to each other.

'That's the goal that I think is so important. Because I'm in no doubt as, having been Prime Minister for four-and-a-half years, having seen how our intelligence services work, I know that some of these plots that get prevented, the lives that get saved. 

'There is a very real connection between that and the capabilities that our intelligence services, within the law, use to defend our people.'

But US President Barack Obama struck a more cautious tone, agreeing only that there should be a 'dialogue' about balancing national security with concerns about the privacy of web users. 

Mr Obama said: 'It is useful to have civil libertarians and others tapping us on the shoulder in this process and reminding us that there are values at stake as well.

'We shouldn't feel as if because we've just seen such a horrific attack in Paris, that suddenly everything should be going by the wayside. 

'Unfortunately this has been a constant background and I think will continue to be for every Prime Minister or President for some time to come. 

'We've got to make sure that we don't overreact but that we remain vigilant and are serious about our responsibilities.'
