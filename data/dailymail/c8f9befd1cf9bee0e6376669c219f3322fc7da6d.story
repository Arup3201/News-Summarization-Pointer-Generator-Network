For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters.

Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read.

In Redknapp’s new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - the QPR manager picks his all-time team of the sixties.

GEORGE BEST

The best footballer the British Isles has ever produced, the ultimate street player. A genius. George could add 10,000 to a gate the way that Tom Finney or Stanley Matthews had previously.

BOBBY MOORE

He’s not given the credit for the way he changed the position of centre half in this country. Is he quick? No. Can he head it? No, he’s not very strong in the air. I sometimes wonder whether Bobby would have come through the ranks now.

SIR BOBBY CHARLTON

A player who can hit the target from 30 yards out — that cuts straight to the heart of the game. We were raving about Gareth Bale in his last season in England, but Bobby Charlton was doing that 40 years ago: the same driving runs, the same spectacular finishes.

BILLY BREMNER

It was not unusual for him to sleep for 13 hours after a match because his effort had been so great. The film The Damned United made him look like a little fat sod with a pot belly. If that was the player that was chasing midfielders all around the pitch for almost 800 games, I don’t think Don Revie’s Leeds would be regarded as one of the greatest teams of all time.

PAUL REANEY

He would be the least favourite opponent of 99 per cent of wingers. Reaney found a way of stopping George Best that eluded other players. His physical approach was important — but his timing and positioning were faultless, too.

Where are poor Paul Gascoigne's friends now he needs their help?

Dalglish had West Ham stars standing and applauding at 15... then he signed for Celtic!

Alan Hansen reminded me of Bobby Moore, that's why he's in my team of the Eighties

Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing 

Wenger heralded a change... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports to England

Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent 

Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while on TV!

Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too 

Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that!
