Lord Prescott is embroiled in a furious row with Channel 4 over a programme examining his business links with China.

The former Deputy Prime Minister has threatened an injunction against the producers of a Dispatches documentary after they investigated his association with the country.

The Labour peer has visited China on several occasions since stepping down as an MP in 2010 and has connections to the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges think-tank, set up by ruler Wen Jiabao.

Furious: Lord Prescott has threatened an injunction against producers of a Dispatches documentary

Producers of The Chinese Are Coming incurred the wrath of Lord Prescott after examining the Asian business interests of his son Jonathan.

The programme focuses on the economic clout of China and its commercial interests, in particular lobbying activity by Huawei, a telecoms firm whose UK activities are under investigation by MPs.

The company has spent more than £90,000 over two years lobbying MPs and Ministers.

Jonathan Prescott, a property developer, has faced scrutiny in the past over links between his business and his father’s political responsibilities.

When Lord Prescott was in Government and living in his grace-and-favour apartment in Admiralty House, his son showed building contractors round the property. He denied business had been discussed.

Last night, Lord Prescott’s other son, David, who frequently speaks for his father, asked for questions to be put in text-message form. 

He then failed to respond.

A Channel 4 source said the programme was still being edited.
