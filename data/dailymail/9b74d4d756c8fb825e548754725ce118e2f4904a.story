Romelu Lukaku's last-gasp goal forced an FA Cup third round replay as Everton came from behind to draw 1-1 with Barclays Premier League rivals West Ham. 

Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein takes you through the talking points from Tuesday night's clash at Goodison Park.

TOFFEES TRIO KNOW WAY TO WEMBLEY 

Everton haven't won a major trophy for 20 years but three of their starters on Tuesday night already have FA Cup winners' medals. 

Gareth Barry could add another FA Cup medal to his cabinet if Everton go the distance

Thirty-seven-year-old defender Sylvain Distin was in the Portsmouth team that lifted the cup in 2008, Gareth Barry played for Manchester City when they were triumphant in 2011 and goalkeeper Joel Robles was in the Wigan line-up when they shocked City at Wembley in 2013.

Everton sub Arouna Kone also played for Wigan in that final.

NO-NONSENSE REID SHOWS HIS CLASS 

Winston Reid was his usual uncomplicated self despite speculation over his future. 

The 26-year-old New Zealander is a defenders' defender and had to be at his most alert with opponent, Romelu Lukaku, even bigger and stronger than he is. 

Reid's reading of the game was excellent and saved his goalkeeper Adrian with one clearance, the question is whether he has enough finesse on the ball for a club like Arsenal as he enters the last six months of his contract at Upton Park. 

West Ham defender Winston Reid did enough to keep Romelu Lukaku at bay until the dying seconds

Recent FA Cup history favoured West Ham who had not lost to Everton in the competition since 1957 when future managers Malcolm Allison and John Bond were in their line-up. 

The most famous cup meeting between the clubs came in a 1980 semi-final replay when Frank Lampard Sr scored the winning goal for Second Division Hammers.

NO ROMANCE AT GOODISON 

The lack of atmosphere at Goodison was in contrast to what neighbours Liverpool experienced at AFC Wimbledon the previous evening. 

Plenty of empty blue seats made it feel more like an under-21s development game; Tuesday nights under the floodlights should be reserved for FA Cup replays, not third round ties made-for-TV.

There were plenty of empty seats at Goodison Park as just 22,236 fans attended the FA Cup clash

It wasn't warm on Merseyside, but certainly not freezing. 

Maybe you could just about excuse Everton's Bryan Oviedo from wearing gloves, he is from Costa Rica close to the equator. 

But was it really necessary for Kevin Mirallas, a Belgian international whose formative football years were spent in northern France with Lille, to cover up on such a benign evening.
