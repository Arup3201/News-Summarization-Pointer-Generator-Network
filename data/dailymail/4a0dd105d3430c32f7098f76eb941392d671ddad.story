An ex-rugby player who feared undergoing surgery for his battered nose would leave him resembling Micheal Jackson has won £26,000 after surgeons botched the operation.

Carl Egonu, from Plymouth, wanted to streamline his nose after years of playing the high-octane sport.

The concerned 49-year-old spoke to his doctor about ending up with unusual features similar to those of the late pop star - but he now has a raised scar and a permanent patch of darkened skin on the end of his nose.

Distressing difference: Carl Egonu wanted his nose streamlined after years of playing rugby. Left, the 49-year-old before the surgery, and right, with an obvious dark and raised scar that can never be removed

Mr Egonu said he became depressed and withdrawn after the private operation at Nuffield Hospital, Plymouth, Devon in March 2006. 

The dermabrasion operation left what Judge Christopher Gardner QC described as a 'significant cosmetic defect' on the end of his nose, which he will have for the rest of his life.

Mental effects: Mr Egonu said the surgery made him depressed and he even tried hypnotherapy to help him cope

Although the sportsman has now managed to put his scar to the back of his mind, the judge said there was no doubt it had badly affected him and he even had a session of hypnotherapy to come to terms with the blemish.

Judge Gardner said: 'The resultant appearance of his nose is something that people - including his own children - tend to ask him about, and the experts agree that attempts to camouflage or skin graft will not assist.'

Mr Egonu, a building surveyor, sued the cosmetic surgeon who operated on him, Dr Adeshola Adeniran, who also carries out an NHS role as a locum consultant at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth.

Mr Egonu’s lawyers made no criticism of the medic’s surgical skills, but said he failed to warn his patient about the possible risks of the procedure, which was meant to give his nose a cleaner, smoother profile.

The judge added: 'Having reached an age where he had finished playing rugby - in which sport his nose had been injured on occasions but not fractured - he consulted Dr Adeniran to ascertain whether the shape of his nose, the bulbous tip of which he felt was too large, could be made more streamlined, and at the same time some small acne lumps could be removed or reduced - although they were not his main concern.'

The surgery carried a higher risk of causing hyper-pigmented scarring, resulting in darker areas of skin, because Mr Egonu is black, his lawyers claimed.

'Hyper-pigmented': The businessman, left before the operation and right, afterwards, had wanted to reduce the bulbous tip of his nose and remove acne scars at the same time - although this was not his main concern

Drastically altered: The building surveyor says even his own children ask him about the scar, and that he should have been better warned of the risks

Life-changing mistake: The judge agreed that Mr Egonu would probably not have gone ahead with the operation had he been properly informed of the scarring risk

He had wanted the size of his nose reduced by the procedure, the county court heard, and believed there was no risk of permanent adverse scarring.

Hyper-pigmentation is the result of an overproduction of melanin, a substance which gives skin and hair its colour, protects against UV light and absorbs heat from the sun.  

An overproduction of melanin leads to a mottled, uneven skin tone. It can be stimulated by excessive sun exposure, hormones, or scarring.

Post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation is a darkening of skin as a result of skin injury or acne scarring, caused by an inflammatory response in skin.

You cannot stimulate cells the skin's immune system cells without stimulating cells linked to melanin production. If the pigment is found in cells deep in the skin it is very difficult to treat.

Dr Adeniran, however, insisted that he gave Mr Egonu a strengthened warning about the potential downsides of the operation.

At their initial consultation, he claimed Mr Egonu told him he had a good knowledge about the options open to him but did not want a complete rhinoplasty as he did not want to 'look like Michael Jackson'.

Dr Adeniran’s QC, Richard Wilson, urged the judge to reduce the figure because the scar was only visible at a conversational distance, but Mr Egonu was awarded £26,000.

The doctor went on to challenge the county court ruling at London’s Appeal Court. His lawyers argued that he gave his patient a clear warning about the risks of the procedure.

But Mr Egonu insisted that, after his wife expressed concerns, the surgeon reassured him that scarring would not happen, and that, if it did, he would have to use him as a case study.

Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with Lord Justice McFarlane, said the county court judge found that Mr Egonu gave consistent evidence that he would not have gone ahead with the operation had he been properly informed of the scarring risk.

'There was sufficient material before Judge Gardner to justify those conclusions,' she said, refusing Dr Adeniran permission to appeal and confirming Mr Egonu’s pay-out.
