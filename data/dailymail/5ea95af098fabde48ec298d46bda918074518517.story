Something like this, maybe? Dallas man Ogiesoba City Osula tried to eat a stolen credit card while awaiting questioning in the back of a police car in order to conceal evidence of his fraud activities

A Dallas man who was convicted Friday of fraudulently collecting other people's tax refunds tried to eat a debit card in order to conceal evidence.

Ogiesoba City Osula made a trip to meet some cohorts in Ohio in 2011. That's when police caught him with $300,000 in cash and money order and stolen debit cards in his car.

While waiting in a police car to be questioned by authorities, the U.S. attorney’s office has revealed that Osula tried to gobble up the incriminating evidence.

It began when Osula was in Cincinnati meeting the leader of a fraud ring similar to his.

A
drug sniffing dog alerted police to the presence of drugs in his car 
and when police searched it they found the incriminating evidence.

According to the Dallas Morning News, Osula was found guilty on 16 counts last week after a nearly weeklong trial.

More specifically, a jury found Osula guilty on one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, mail fraud, and bank fraud.

He
was also found guilty on seven counts of presenting fraudulent tax 
refund claims to the United States, two counts of fraud in connection 
with access devices and aiding and abetting; and six counts of 
aggravated identity theft.

Osula’s identity theft crime is known to authorities as Stolen Identity Refund Fraud or SIRF.

Perpetrators
of this crime obtain the personal identifying information of others, 
including Social Security numbers and dates of birth. They then complete
Individual Income Tax Return Forms, submit them to the IRS, and receive
checks by mail.

According to FBI.gov, the federal government loses around $2 billion to these schemes annually.

Along with his four co-defendants, Osula managed to bilk the government out of millions.

His
sentencing hearing will be held at a later date, but for each fraud 
count he could be sentenced to 30 years for conspiracy to commit wire 
fraud, mail fraud, and bank fraud as well as 15 years for fraud in 
connection with access devices and two more years for aggravated 
identity theft.

Each of his co-defendants has pleaded guilty.

Better than the alternative? Osula was found guilty on 16 counts of fraud and other charges related to his role as leader of a Texas crime ring that submitted fraudulent tax refund claims adding up to millions of dollars
