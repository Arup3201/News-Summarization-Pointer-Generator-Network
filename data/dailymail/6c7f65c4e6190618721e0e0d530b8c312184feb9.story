This was the moment a driver ended up parked on top of another car after veering off a dual carriageway.

Emergency services were called to the scene, near the Wyvern Retail Park, Derby, at 3.18pm yesterday and the female driver was taken to hospital.

Pictures show a silver Renault, with the front bumper missing, on top of a red Ford.

The driver lost control while navigating a corner on the A52 before veering on to a patch of grass and landing on top of a parked car below.

Emergency services have said that the driver of the car was fortunate that there was a car below, as it collapsed under the weight of the vehicle and cushioned the fall.

Firefighter Gareth Murtagh said: 'A vehicle left the A52 at the side of the Toys R Us car park.

'The driver didnâ€™t quite make the corner, mounted the grass verge and landed on to parked cars.

'It was fortunate the parked cars were there as they gave way when the car fell.

'We have seen accidents in this area before but never of this nature.'

A spokesman for the East Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'We received an emergency 999 call at 15:28 and the caller reported an RTC in Chaddesden in Derbyshire.

'Highly skilled clinicians were dispatched in a fast response vehicle and double crewed ambulance, and the ambulance took a female patient to Royal Derby Hospital.'
