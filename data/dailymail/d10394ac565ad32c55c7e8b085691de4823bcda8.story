A fraudster made £22,000 selling fake Poppy Appeal and Help for Heroes pins, conning people into thinking they were making charity donations while he pocketed the cash.

Jay Meech also sourced and sold counterfeit badges of Premier League clubs including Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Southampton.

The 28-year-old ripped off the charities and clubs to the tune of around £22,000, Portsmouth Crown Court heard.

'Despicable': Fraudster Jay Meech made £22,000 selling fake Poppy Appeal, Help for Heroes and football club pins

Meech, 28, was caught after the Premier League became suspicious of the fake pins, showing Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Southampton logos

Jonathan Underhill, prosecuting, said Meech sold the fake pins, made in China and shipped to the UK, through a website he ran for six years.

The fraudster was caught when the Premier League grew suspicious that the pins were fake.

Officers from Trading Standards ordered Southampton and Chelsea badges and confirmed the league's suspicions.

Meech sent the investigators his business card with the orders, giving away his address and allowing them to storm his home in Gosport, Hampshire, shortly before Remembrance Sunday in 2013.

During the search, they discovered 5,849 Poppy Appeal badges, 706 Help for Heroes badges and over 1,000 football club pins, the court heard.

Of the £22,000 made through the sales of the badges, around two-thirds of this went to Meech.

Around £3,000 of the money accounted for was from sales of the charity pins. 

Meech made £3,000 from the charity badges, as well as thousands more from the football club pins

Merok admitted 10 counts of unauthorised use of trademarks and was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years

Disgraceful: The forces charities slammed Meech's crimes as 'despicable' after his sentencing

Meech admitted 10 counts of unauthorised use of a trademark and was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and told to pay £1,650 in costs.

Judge Roger Hetherington said: 'You started off honestly trading legitimate badges, but at some point greed got the better of you because of the profit you could get by sourcing the badges from China which showed some considerable planning.

'This was a fraudulent activity which made you a sizeable sum of money.'

In mitigation, the court heard Meech had made a donation of £600 to each charity.

Councillor Roy Perry, leader of Hampshire County Council, said: 'It's despicable that anyone could think of profiting to the detriment of two such worthy charities, particularly when we have been remembering the sacrifices of our armed forces now and 100 years ago with the commemorations of the start of the First World War.

'These kinds of criminal activities severely damage the local economy and legitimate traders by gaining a competitive advantage at their expense, and taking trade away from genuine hard-working businesses, and in this case charities.'

Officials from the two charities also slammed Meech for his fraud, describing the targeting of charities as 'despicable'.

Jo Brookes, from Help for Heroes, said: 'He deceived the public into thinking that by purchasing one, they were helping servicemen.'

Richard Dickson, president of Gosport and Alverstoke Royal British Legion in Hants, added: 'Cheats like this need to be brought to justice and there's no more despicable a crime than targeting charities.'
