Manchester United fans drooling at the prospect of Louis van Gaal bringing a clutch of Holland players with him to Old Trafford had their bubble burst on Sunday, as a number of reported targets went missing against Mexico.

The only players linked with a move to United that emerged with any credit in Fortaleza were Dirk Kuyt, the former Liverpool attacker unusually employed at left wing-back by van Gaal, and centre-back Stefan de Vrij.

Targets: Martins Indi, De Jong and Janmaat have all been linked with moves to Old Trafford

Kuyt is renowned for his willingness to chase lost causes and put his body on the line for his team, and that was the case again as he played in a deep position on the left and made some crucial tackles in defensive areas for Holland.

De Vrij, meanwhile, looked good moving out of defence with the ball but was shaky when dealing with Mexico's vibrant attacking pair of Oribe Peralta and Giovani dos Santos.

Holland were dealt an early blow as Nigel de Jong was forced off through injury. The AC Milan player  lasted just nine minutes before limping off to be replaced by another United target Bruno Martins Indi.

De Jong has been crucial for Holland at the last two World Cups and his presence was missed in central areas, with Daley Blind moving into midfield to take his place.

In fact, Mexico took the lead with a swerving shot from exactly the kind of area that De Jong usually patrols. Giovani dos Santos pushed the ball away from Blind 25 yards from goal and then smacked a shot into the bottom right corner with his left foot.

United’s search for centre-backs to replace Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic has been well documented. Two of Holland’s back-three against Mexico, Martins Indi and De Vrij, have been outlined as van Gaal targets, but neither impressed defensively against Miguel Herrera’s side.

United are said to be hijacking Lazio’s move for De Vrij, while Martins Indi is reported to have an offer on the table from Porto.

Martins Indi was strong in the air but he struggled with the pace and directness of Dos Santos and Peralta.

Pass-master: De Vrij's distribution was good but he looked less comfortable against Mexico's pace in attack

De Vrij was comfortable bringing the ball out of defence. On a number of occasions he nicked the ball from Mexico’s attackers, strolled forward and then played incisive passes towards Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie.

One of Holland’s best chances in the game from a similar passage of play. Midway through the first half De Vrij waltzed over the halfway line and pinged a forward pass to van Persie. The Manchester United attacker controlled the ball brilliantly but his shot on the turn let him down, the ball flashing wide of Guillermo Ochoa’s goal.

Another United target, Daryl Janmaat, played no part against Mexico. Van Gaal is reportedly keen on taking the right-back to Old Trafford with him, but the Dutch boss did not trust him to start in their last-16 clash, instead picking Augsburg defender Paul Verhaegh.

Van Gaal's team relied on some late magic from old-timers Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben to spare their blushes, the former lashing home from a corner and the latter winning the penalty that Huntelaar slotted into the corner to put Holland through.
