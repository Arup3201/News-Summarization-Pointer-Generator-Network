Rich Russians stuffed wads of cash into the pockets of Costa Concordia crew members to bribe them for coveted places on the lifeboats, it has been claimed.

Italian investigators are looking into eyewitness accounts that 'expensively dressed Eastern Europeans' paid off staff as 'the disabled were left to fend for themselves'.

Giglio resident Franca Anichini also said the first residents to reach dry land on lifeboats were not 'wounded women and children' - instead, she saw 'healthy men and elegant women in evening gowns who were speaking Russian' being the first to be saved, RadarOnline.com reported.

The claims came as dramatic pictures emerged showing accounts describing the disaster's aftermath as like a scene from the Titanic were not far wrong.

Disaster: Lifeboats can be seen fleeing the doomed Costa Concordia moments after it hit rocks off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13

Fleeing: The boats can be seen in the waters near the island of Giglio while passengers wait to board others still on board. At the prow of the ship, holidaymakers can be seen attempting to make their way to safety

The bodies of three German passengers were identified this morning. Sixteen deaths have been confirmed so far and 22 people are still missing. Divers are keeping up the search for bodies, but officials acknowledged it would take 'a miracle' to find any more survivors.

Salvage experts also continued work today to begin pumping tons of fuel off the ship.

In the pictures, that emerged last night, lifeboats can be seen spilling from the sides of the boat into the gloomy waters off the island of Giglio as the cruise liner sinks into the sea.Passengers at the rear on 
the starboard side wait to climb aboard those lifeboats which haven't
 already been deployed.

And holidaymakers,
 who moments earlier had been enjoying dinner on the luxury vessel, make their way around the heavily-banking prow of the 
ship.

The whole 
dramatic scene is lit up like a Hollywood movie by the many lights on 
the Concordia, which would soon plunge into darkness as it sank into the
 water, claiming at least 16 lives.

Today, search efforts aboard the doomed liner continued, but an official overseeing the operation acknowledged for the first time that it would take a miracle to find any more survivors.

Franco Gabrielli, head of Italy's national civil protection agency, said rescuers would keep searching the ship, which is half-submerged in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the island, until every reachable area is inspected.

'Finding someone alive today belongs in the realm of miracles,' Gabrielli said.

'But since none of us, at least inside, wants to give up on that possibility, we will continue.'

Operations today saw search teams set off more explosions on the submerged third floor deck to allow easier access for divers.

Seventeen people are still 
unaccounted for, but the last person to be found alive was on January 15
 when a senior crew member was discovered less than 36 hours after the 
grounding.

A hairdresser was the last person to leave the stricken Costa Concordia, it has emerged.

Giovanni Di Mauro, 35, shamed the ship's Captain Coward by reportedly staying on board for seven hours to help hundreds of passengers to safety.

His heroic efforts came as disgraced Francisco Schettino, 52, was ferried to shore just two hours after the vessel hit the rocks. He claims he fell into a lifeboat.

Giovanni defied danger to organise the ferrying of survivors in rescue boats as the ship listed at a crazy angle off Italian isle Giglio, investigators have been told.

He has shrugged off praise by telling Rome's Il Messaggero newspaper: 'At some point I thought I might die but I was there to help.'

The Concordia ran aground after 
Captain Francesco Schettino veered from his approved course and gashed 
the ship's hull on a reef, forcing the panicked evacuation of the 4,200 
passengers and crew.

On 
Wednesday, the chief executive of Costa Crociere SpA, Pier Luigi Foschi,
 insisted that Schettino didn't have approval to change the ship's 
routing and was going far too fast to be so close to shore.

But
 he defended the practice of so-called 'tourist navigation,' whereby 
enormous cruise ships steer close to shore to give passengers a look at 
the sites. He said it was part of the 'cruise product' that passengers 
demand and that cruise lines are forced to offer to stay competitive.

'It's
 something that enriches the cruise product,' Foschi told a 
parliamentary committee.

'There are many components of the cruise 
product, and we have to do them like everyone else because we are in a 
global competition.'

Foschi stressed that such deviations 
from charted routes are supposed to follow strict protocols that ensure 
safety: ports are informed, the company is informed, and certainly no 
ship of the Concordia's size would be charging 200-300 yards off shore 
at 16 knots.

'For anyone who knows that zone, that ship with those characteristics shouldn't have been there,' he said.

Schettino
 is under house arrest, facing accusations of manslaughter, causing a 
shipwreck and abandoning a ship before all passengers were evacuated.

His
 lawyer filed a motion challenging the house arrest, saying Schettino 
wasn't a flight risk and asserting that there was no risk that he would 
repeat the crime since no cruise line would hire him, the ANSA news 
agency reported.
