Liverpool's weaknesses were exposed by an impressive West Ham on Saturday night, leaving manager Brendan Rodgers with plenty of problems to address.

If they are to repeat last season's heroics and mount a sustained challenge for the Premier League title, the manager will need to make quick fixes.

Here's five areas in which the Reds were shown up by the Hammers at Upton Park.

Liverpool's 3-1 defeat at West Ham exposed a number of weaknesses that Brendan Rodgers needs to address

PANIC IN THE DEFENCE

Liverpool's back line were clearly not mentally prepared for the game and they were breached twice in the opening seven minutes.

Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren looked in utter disarray right from the off, while goalkeeper Simon Mignolet got his positioning all wrong.

Granted, it was only the third time Lovren and Skrtel have started together at the heart of the defence but they were lightweight and unable to deal with the power and physicality of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho.

Rodgers did the right thing in removing Javi Manquillo for Mamadou Sakho after just 20 minutes and his three-man defence helped give Liverpool some impetus going forward.

Yet when Lovren and Sakho clashed heads in the first-half, it neatly summed up the chaos.

The defence lacked cohesion and leadership and Rodgers will be alarmed at how long it may take for his new-look rearguard to gel together.

LACK OF CONCENTRATION

As alluded to, there were too many moments when Liverpool switched off and West Ham were swift in punishing them.

Mignolet, who was at fault for the Ludogorets goals in the Champions League in midweek, was stood in the wrong place as Stewart Downing sent a high free-kick to the far post inside the first 90 seconds, allowing James Tomkins to head down and Winston Reid to tap in.

Jordan Henderson and Skrtel were also culpable in the Hammers' opening goal as they failed to deal with the cross.

For the second goal, six minutes later, Mignolet was exposed again when Sakho found the top corner with an audacious dink from the edge of the area.

Left-back Alberto Moreno was also guilty of not being alert enough to close the West Ham man down.

During the second half, Skrtel miscontrolled a back pass and Sakho pinched the ball from him on the edge of the area.

The Slovakian defender got away with that one but Mamadou Sakho wasn't so lucky two minutes from time when his weak header went straight to the feet of Downing.

His perfect through ball to Morgan Amalfitano resulted in West Ham's third goal and made absolutely sure of victory.

Rodgers is all-too-aware that mistakes like these will prove costly in the Premier League and especially in the Champions League.

NO CONTROL IN MIDFIELD

Sam Allardyce sent his team out with intent and purpose and they quickly seized control of the midfield, a grip they didn't relinquish for the full 90 minutes.

It is rare to see Steven Gerrard and Henderson have such poor games and Lucas wasn't a great deal better.

Indeed, the Brazilian was replaced at half-time by Adam Lallana as Rodgers desperately tried to inject a bit more creativity.

By contrast, the West Ham midfield were on top of their game. The bustling Chiekhou Kouyate was one of the stand-out performers in this match and of the Premier League afternoon.

Allardyce has likened him to Patrick Vieira and his robust challenges certainly had Liverpool rattled.

Alex Song revealed before the match that he used to train in a Gerrard shirt but there was certainly no deference for his idol as he patrolled the midfield along with Kouyate and Mark Noble.

This is by no means the best midfield Liverpool will face this season, yet they still found themselves overpowered.

WHERE ARE THE GOALS COMING FROM?

Fabio Borini vowed to stay at Anfield and fight for his place but he didn't put forward a very convincing argument here.

The striker was bombarded with abusive tweets after a limp performance in which he failed to provide a cutting edge to Liverpool's attack.

Rodgers opted for the Italian ahead of Rickie Lambert and handed him a first start of the season but West Ham's defence weren't unduly troubled.

His strike partner Mario Balotelli played him in with a brilliant cross-field ball on 53 minutes but Borini opted to shoot, straight at goalkeeper Adrian, rather than pulling the ball back to better-placed colleagues.

Rodgers will be desperate to get Daniel Sturridge fit and firing as soon as possible given the shortcomings of the alternatives.

IS BALOTELLI STILL A LIABILITY?

There has been a lot of talk from both Rodgers that Balotelli is a reformed character who has consigned his immature antics to history.

But the hotheaded Italian flared up in the second half when he went head-to-head with West Ham's Adrian.

The keeper foolishly kicked out at Balotelli after a heavy tackle but the striker's reaction was disappointing to see. Both were fortunate to get away with a caution.

Balotelli will score plenty of goals for Liverpool but that nagging doubt remains that he might be a liability with that aggression never far away.
