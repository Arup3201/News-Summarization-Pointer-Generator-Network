Joanne Thompson, a senior staff nurse in the special care baby unit of the hospital, has been allowed to continue working

A nurse who helped treat twins who died from a huge overdose of morphine at the scandal-hit Stafford Hospital has been allowed to keep working.

Joanne Thompson admitted a series of charges before a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) fitness to practise hearing in London this week.

But the panel ruled her fitness to practise 'was not impaired'.

An inquest into the deaths of the twins, Alfie and Harry McQuillan, who died on November 1, 2010, heard that they were given an 'excessive' dose of morphine hours after their birth at Stafford Hospital.

The babies were born at 27 weeks after the twins' mother, Ami Dean, was rushed to Stafford Hospital in the early hours of October 30th, 2010, after she began to bleed.

Despite being born prematurely, the 
identical twins had been in a 'good' condition during the first few 
hours of their lives, an inquest into their deaths in 2012 heard.

But it was decided to give the twins 
morphine to stabilise them before they were transferred to the maternity
unit at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire where the twins 
died on November 1st.

The panel heard that the brothers, referred to in the proceedings as twin one and twin two, received 600 and 850 microgrammes of morphine respectively.

They should have been given between 50 and 100 microgrammes.

Mrs Thompson, a senior staff nurse in the hospital's special care baby unit, was accused of allowing a more junior nurse, Lisa Lucas, prepare for the administration and/or administer the drug to the twins with the help of a junior doctor whom she should have known was insufficiently experienced.

The NMC panel found this claim was not proved.

The nurse admitted not being present throughout the whole morphine administration process, that she did not check it was properly diluted, and she did not call for medical help to check the administration.

Mrs Thompson denied a series of 
charges including failing to take the clinical lead of nursing care when
required in relation to the administration of the morphine to the 
babies.

Mrs Thompson broke down in tears as the aftermath of what happened was discussed.

The hearing comes after the Francis 
inquiry into failings at Stafford Hospital where it is estimated there 
were between 400 and 1,200 excess deaths between 2005 and 2009.

The NMC trubunal heard today that Mrs Thompson's 'main concern' had been to save the lives of the twins, the panel, led by chairman, Graham Park, said.

In its written ruling, the panel congratulated Mrs Thompson on being a 'highly competent nurse'.

It said: 'In the panel's judgment its finding of no misconduct in these 
particular circumstances, would not undermine the public confidence in 
the nursing profession and the standards expected of nurses.

'The panel was impressed by the numerous and consistently very positive 
references and testimonials provided by your employers and professional 
colleagues, including the Trust's lead consultant paediatrician, 
the director of nursing and midwifery and a junior member of staff who works under your supervision.

'It is abundantly clear that all those individuals have a high level of 
confidence in your professional skills, knowledge, and good character.

'There is no evidence to suggest that your current standard of practise 
presents any risk to the public, and in particular to patients.

'Rather the evidence shows that you are a highly competent nurse of 
considerable experience, capable of maintaining proper standards of 
nursing care, conduct and performance.'
