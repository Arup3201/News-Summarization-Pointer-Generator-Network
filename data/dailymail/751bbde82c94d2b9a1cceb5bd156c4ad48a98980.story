At first glance some of these extraordinary satellite images could be mistaken for bizarre works of modern art rather than towns and cities that are home to millions of people.

From the elegant bird-shaped design of Brazil's capital Brasilia, to the circles and intricate diagonal grid pattern of downtown Washington DC - some of the greatest urban spaces on Earth look almost as distinctive from space as they do at ground level.

And the ingenuity of the architects who planned and designed them through the ages, from the Renaissance to the 1960s, can still be seen today.

Brasilia: The elegant bird-like design of the Brazilian capital, Brasilia has been recognised with World Heritage listed status. The city, which was built in the 1960s, is home to around four million people

With a shape that resembles a bird or even an aircraft - the Brazilian capital Brasilia is one of the most distinctive looking cities in the world.

Opened in 1960 as a replacement to Brazil's former capital Rio de Janeiro, the city is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was planned and developed in 1956 with Lúcio Costa as the principal urban planner and Oscar Niemeyer the principal architect.

It is one of the biggest cities in the world to be built since the beginning of the 20th Century. The impressive city is divided into numbered blocks as well as sectors for
specified activities.

Canberra was chosen as a compromise 
as the location for Australia's capital following a long dispute between
the country's two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, over which 
should be given the title.

Designed
by American architect Walter Burley Griffin in 1912 following a 
competition - the Australian Parliament did not move in to the city 
until 1927.

Nicknamed the 
'Bush City,' Canberra's design was heavily influenced by the garden city
movement and features large open areas with lots of natural vegetation.

Palmanova: Built during the Renaissance, Palmanova in Italy is said to be the only town in the world designed to follow the ideals of a 'utopia.' Shaped like a star, it was created as a fortress to help defend the area against Ottoman attack

The ideal of the perfect city has consumed some of the world's greatest architects for generations - as shown by the intricate beauty of the town of Palmanova in Italy.

Built during the Renaissance, Palmanova is said to be the only town in the world designed to follow the ideals of a 'utopia.' Designed in the shape of a star with three nine sided ring 
roads, it was built 
at the end of the 16th century by the once powerful Venetian Republic. It is located in the north east of Italy near the border with modern day Slovenia.

It was created as a defensive settlement designed to help protect the area from the threat of Ottoman attack - which is reflected by its shape. It is now home to around 5,000 people.

Built in the 1950s to house workers 
at a huge copper ore factory, the tiny town of El Salvador in Chile is 
one of the more unlikely examples of architectural genius on this list.

At
an elevation of more than 2,400 meters in the foothills of the Andes 
and in the middle of the Atacama Desert the town stands out vividly 
against its remote surroundings.

The
man who designed it, Raymond Olson, who worked for the Anaconda Mining 
Company, showed his sense of fun - as well as practicality - by using a 
mixture of grids and curves to give the town the shape of a Roman 
soldier's helmet.

Washington, D.C: It was designed as America's capital - and Washington certainly lives up to its elevated status architecturally as shown in this satellite image

It is home to some of the world's best known buildings, from the White House to the Pentagon - but how many people would recognise Washington DC from above is open to debate.

French-born architect Pierre Charles L’Enfant was chosen to design America's new capital city in 1791. His plan featured broad streets and avenues based on plans for cities such as Paris and Amsterdam.

He was eventually dismissed following disputes with the commissioners appointed to supervise building the city - but is credited with its overall design. With its distinctive mixture of circles and grids the city is an eye catching sight from above.

La Plata in Argentina was planned as
a provincial capital after the city of Buenos Aires became the 
country's capital city in 1880.

Designed by architect Pedro Benoit, it is characterised by a large 
square shaped divided up by a distinctive grid system with avenues and 
diagonal streets. The two major roads which cross the city come together in the main square, the Plaza Moreno.

Jaipur, India: This beautiful city was built in the 18th Century based on the principles of Vastu Shastra or 'science of construction. It features a grid system and a huge central palace complex

Jaipur in India was founded in 1727 by Maharaja Ram Seo Master II of Amber who ruled from 1699 to 1744. The city's design is based in part on the classical principles of Vastu Shastra or 'science of construction.'

It took around four years to complete and consists of nine blocks. Five quarters surround the palace quarter - which encloses a huge palace complex - in the centre of the city.

Jaipur boasts a World Heritage Site in the observatory, Jantar Mantar, and is one of India's most popular tourist destinations.

Founded in 1836 the Australian city of Adelaide was located close to the River Torrens and set out in a grid layout.

The
city features beautiful, wide streets and many green public squares - 
including a parkland which surrounds its central district.

Adelaide
was originally shaped by the ideals of religious freedom and political 
progressivism. The centre of the city is the location for many 
government and financial institutions.

New Haven: Nicknamed the 'Elm City' because of its mature trees - New Haven is one of the oldest and most attractive cities in the United States. The city is built in a grid pattern around a central square called New Haven Green

One of the oldest settlements in the United States, New Haven is also one of the most beautiful. Founded in 1638 by English Puritans, its original eight streets were laid out in a four by four pattern grid.

The city is built around a central common block called New Haven Green, and is home to the world famous Yale University.

New Haven is very green - and reportedly had the first public tree planting programme in the US. It is nicknamed the 'Elm City.'

Belo Horizonte - or 'Beautiful Horizon' in English - in the south east of Brazil is the country's fourth largest city.

Planned
and built during the late 20th Century to replace Ouro Preto as the 
capital of the surrounding region, it now boasts a wide mix of modern 
and classical architecture.

Many
of the most interesting buildings are located in the Pampulha area - 
including one of the world's biggest football stadiums, the Mineirão. Belo Horizonte is located on several hills and surrounded by mountains.
