Israel has approved a controversial plan to build nearly 1,200 new West Bank homes for Jewish settlers  - just days before renewed peace talks are set to resume.

Palestinians reacted with fury last night and said the move cast doubt on Israel’s ‘sincerity in the peace process’.

But they did not threaten to pull out of the next round of negotiations, which start on Wednesday.

Building site: Apartment blocks under construction seen in the West Bank Jewish settlement of Beitar Ilit, near Bethlehem. Israel said it was marketing nearly 1,200 new homes for Jewish settlers in the West Bank

Israel is expected later this week to free a first group of 26 Palestinian prisoners out of a total of 104 Arab inmates.

Their release was approved by Tel Aviv last month to help restart the talks brokered by the US.

The issue of building settlements in occupied Palestinian areas halted the last direct talks in September 2010.

About 500,000 Jews live in more than 100 settlements built since Israel’s 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Opinions: Israel's housing minister Uri Ariel (left) said 'no country in the world would take orders on where it could build its homes'. Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat (right) called for international condemnation

The Palestinians want to establish their state in those areas as well as the Gaza Strip.

'The international community must stand with this peace process and must stand shoulder to shoulder with us and hold Israel accountable for its continuing settlement activities'

Saeb Erekat, Palestinian chief negotiator

Israel’s housing minister Uri Ariel said ‘no country in the world would take orders on where it could build its homes’.

Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat called for international condemnation of the new homes.

‘The international community must stand with this peace process and must stand shoulder to shoulder with us and hold Israel accountable for its continuing settlement activities,’ he said.
