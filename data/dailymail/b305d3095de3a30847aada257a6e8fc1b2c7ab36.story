A pair of amorous donkeys who were separated because of complaints over their mating have been reunited at a zoo in Poland.

Napoleon and Antosia had been together for 10 years when they got in trouble with outraged mothers who complained about their children having to watch them mate.

Local conservative official Lydia Dudziak took up their cause and persuaded the director Stare Zoo in Poznan to have the animals put in separate pens.

However, after a petition was signed by almost 7,000 people, the lovebirds were brought back together today after their agonising week apart.

'It was never our intention for any animals to feel uncomfortable because of their natural behaviours,' the zoo said in a statement.

The forced break-up of the long-standing romance has become national news over the past few days - two Facebook pages were made in support of the donkeys with almost 10,000 likes between them - as well as pictures of Napoleon and Antosia in the act.

Experts weighed in, saying the separation could hurt their psychological wellbeing, and politicians were asked about it on the country's leading news programmes.

'Animals separated by sex into different cages? It's complete idiocy,' said Stefan Niesiolowski, a lawmaker with the governing party, Civic Platform.

Even the spokesman for Law and Justice, the conservative party that Ms Dudziak belongs to, would not come to her defence.

'It's a level of absurdity that has been crossed to such an extent that I don't even want to read or know about this,' Adam Hofman said yesterday evening.

In their decade together, Napoleon and Antosia have produced six offspring, including two-month old Tadeusz.
