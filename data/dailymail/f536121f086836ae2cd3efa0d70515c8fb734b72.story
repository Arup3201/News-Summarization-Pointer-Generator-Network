The father of a Cherokee girl at the center of a custody battle is to be extradited to South Carolina to face accusations that he interfered with a court order to give her adopted parents visitation rights.

Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed the extradition papers yesterday, ordering Dusten Brown to South Carolina for 'disobeying a court order'.

Mr Brown has been granted an emergency stay to keep three-year-old Veronica, but he is accused of denying visitation rights to Matt and Melanie Capobianco, her adopted parents.

Family history: Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011

He surrendered to the Sequoyah County Court earlier today and was released on bond, according to Wistv 10.

The Capobiancos, who have cared for the little girl from birth, have been locked in a custody battle for years with Mr Brown, the child's biological father.

Veronica's birth mother put her up for adoption but Mr Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation, fought the Capobiancos' adoption of her under the Indian Child 
Welfare Act.

Order: Governor Mary Fallin has signed extradition papers for Dusten Brown

In a statement yesterday, Governor Fallin said: 'Unfortunately, it has become clear that Dusten Brown is not acting in good faith', Fox News reported.

'He has disobeyed an Oklahoma court order to allow the Capobiancos to visit their adopted daughter, and continues to deny visitation.'

The couple had their adoption approved by the courts on July 31, but last month Mr Brown refused to hand Veronica over, which led to an extradition order being requested.

He faces charges of custodial interference in South Carolina. 

Governor Fallin had said last month she would not sign the extradition order if Mr Brown showed a willingness to work with his daughter's adopted parents.

But, in her statement, she said: 'He is acting in open violation of both Oklahoma and South Carolina courts ... he has cut off negotiations with the Capobiancos and shown no interest in pursuing any other course than yet another lengthy legal battle.'

An attorney for Mr Brown however, said the extradition order doesn't mean he will be extradited. Mr Brown will have a judicial hearing to argue South Carolina doesn't allege a crime, just a violation, according to News 9.

Clark Brewster added that the Capobiancos had visited Veronica a lot, and said his legal team has offered to meet Ms Fallin to explain the situation but so far she has declined their invitation.

Last week, Oklahoma Supreme Court granted an emergency stay to keep Veronica with her biological father.

Court order: Dusten Brown leaves a custody hearing at Oklahoma Supreme Court on Wednesday

Denied: Melanie and Matt Capobianco have not been allowed access to their adopted daughter, according to the extradition order signed by Governor Fallin

Both sides were in a Nowata County 
court last Friday. The Oklahoma Supreme Court granted an emergency stay to
the Nowata court's ruling that Veronica should be transferred 
immediately to the Capobiancos.

The stay comes after Mr Brown turned himself in to authorities on August 12, but refused extradition to South Carolina, where the Capobiancos live, and where state authorities had finalized Veronica's adoption.

'This is my daughter,' Mr Brown said, according to Anderson Cooper 360. 'It isn't a yoyo I borrowed for two years.'

Mr Brown posted $10,000 bond and was released on August 12, according to Oklahoma's Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office.

Battle: Veronica with her biological father, Dusten Brown, who wants to raise her

Adopted parents: Matt and Melanie Capobianco were awarded custody of the girl they raised from birth

Last week, a lawyer appointed to look out for the best interests of the three-year-old asked a judge to suspend visitation rights for her adoptive parents - a complete turnaround after the South Carolina court awarded the Capobiancos custody of Veronica on July 31.

The James Island, South Carolina parents have been trying to adopt Veronica since her birth in 2009 after which they raised the girl for two years.

But Mr Brown has had custody of his daughter since 2011, when South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled that a 1978 federal law written to ensure Native American children stay with Native American parents gave him preference over the Capobiancos.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law does not apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of Veronica and abandoned her before birth.

Mr Brown had never met his daughter 
and, after Veronica's mother, who is not an American American, rebuffed 
his marriage proposal, played no role during the pregnancy and paid no 
child support after the girl was born.

The
legal proceedings began when Mr Brown found out Veronica was going to 
be adopted. He objected and said the Indian Child Welfare Act favored 
the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions.

In the middle: Veronica has been caught in an ongoing tug of war custody battle for most of her young life

The Capobiancos appealed the South Carolina Supreme Court's 2011 decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and it ruled in June that South Carolina courts should decide who gets to adopt Veronica. The state court said the Capobiancos should raise the girl.

South Carolina Family Court Judge Daniel Martin finalized the couple's adoption, approving a transition plan detailing a gradual process for reintroducing the girl to the Capobiancos.

South Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Mr Brown's arrest, charging him with custodial interference for failing to appear with the girl for a court-ordered meeting with the Capobiancos on August 4 — a date the couple has said was set by the judge and to which Brown's attorneys did not object.
