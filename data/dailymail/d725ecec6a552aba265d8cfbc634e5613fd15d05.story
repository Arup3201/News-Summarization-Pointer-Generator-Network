A new video has emerged showing heavily armed Islamic State fighters stalking backstreets in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane while American warplanes circle overhead.

The footage, which emerged on social media accounts linked to the terror group, shows jihadists wandering rubble-lined roads and entering destroyed buildings while the sound of intense gun fights is heard nearby.

The video emerged as fierce street battles broke out yesterday - the first significant fighting in the city since the majority of ISIS' militants were pushed back into the suburbs two days ago by the most intense coalition bombing raids of the past few weeks.

The clashes came as desperate ISIS jihadists launched a final assault 'on all fronts' to take the town yesterday, after the militants felt the full force of American air power with sustained bombing raids resulting in a series of spectacular explosions in the besieged Syrian town.

Threat: The video begins by showing an American warplane circling overhead while ISIS militants can be heard chanting religious slogans and asking God to keep them safe

Campaign: The militants enter partially-destroyed factories, where makeshift bedding (left) can be seen against graffiti-daubed walls - suggesting the rooms are being used to house militants while they besiege the town

Masked men are then seen stalking the Kobane backstreets, wandering from building to building as the sound of intense fighting is heard nearby.

The militants enter partially-destroyed factories, where makeshift bedding can be seen against the walls - suggesting the rooms are being used to house militants while they besiege the town.

Militants, some of them not wearing masks, are then interviewed on camera and describe in Arabic their brutal efforts to seize the town from its largely Kurdish population. 

The extremists have been dramatically pushed back from the town in recent days, having as recently as last week looked like it was about to drive out the last of the brave Kurdish fighters defending it.

As a fresh round of airstrikes rained down earlier this week, the US also ran a series of airdrops for the Kurdish resistance, dispatching weapons and medical supplies.

The video of militants wandering around inside Kobane comes as it emerged ISIS has seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish troops fighting the terrorists in Kobane.

Footage released by the terror group shows a masked militant inspecting cases packed with hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, prompting the U.S. state department to announce it is investigating the video's authenticity. 

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which gathers its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

However analysts have questioned the footage, saying the weapons in the film are not U.S. standard issue and suggesting ISIS may have faked the scenario using arms already in their possession in order to make the American military appear incompetent. 

ISIS militants have been largely pushed out of Kobane this week thanks to sustained American airstrikes

ISIS loyalists took to social media to post sarcastic thank you notes to the United States after the release of the video, including one image that said 'Team USA.'

But if the weapons in the footage prove to be authentic, the situation is more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. 

ISIS already possesses millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

The U.S. Central Command yesterday said American military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobane that destroyed ISIS fighting positions, an ISIS-controlled building and a large ISIS unit.

Meanwhile the Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan yesterday, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.

A young convert to Islam who killed a Canadian soldier in a hit-and-run had been on the radar of federal investigators, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey, authorities said Tuesday.

Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said the attack Monday was 'clearly linked to terrorist ideology.' Quebec Police spokesman Guy Lapointe said the act was deliberate and that one of the two soldiers was in uniform.

Police said the suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, called 911 to report his hit-and-run as police chased him in the Quebec city of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu.

He later was shot dead by police after his car flipped over into a ditch and he brandished a knife as he exited his car. A second soldier suffered minor injuries in the attack. 

Three teenage girls from suburban Denver may have been trying to join Islamic State militants in Syria after stealing their parents' money and flying to Germany, authorities said Tuesday.

The girls — two sisters, ages 17 and 15, and their 16-year-old friend — were reported missing after they skipped school Friday, but the families had no indication of where they might have gone, said Glenn Thompson, bureau chief of the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Department

Suspicion arose when the sisters' father realized his daughters were gone, along with $2,000 and their passports. 

They were stopped at the Frankfurt, Germany, airport over the weekend by FBI agents and returned to Colorado where they were reunited with their families, an FBI spokeswoman said.
