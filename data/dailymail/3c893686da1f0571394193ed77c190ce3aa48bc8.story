A B&B owner has set up a bird box disguised as a roadside speed camera to slow down dangerous drivers.

Stuart McDonald, 57, who runs the Langside B&B in Dunblane, Perthshire, built the box amid concerns that increasing traffic noise and inconsiderate driving was ruining the area.

He said 'It all started out as a bit of fun, but I'm surprised how well it has worked.

The fake speed camera is built on his land  outside Langside B&B in Dunblane, Perthshire, overlooking the road

'It seems to be making people aware of their speed and they now slow down. If it stops people from driving carelessly and endangering the lives of others then it can only be a good thing.

'The farmers in particular like it as they're no longer losing stray sheep to people speeding on the road.'

He built the bird box in four days from off-cuts of wood, an old DVD cover, an old camera lens and a plastic drainpipe.

It has been overlooking the B827 between Braco and Comrie  for two years, but Mr McDonald said he has not received any complaints from the police or Stirling Council.

Mr McDonald said: 'The police have driven past it a few times and haven't said anything yet so I have to assume it is fine.

'It is just a bird box that happens to look a lot like a speed camera. The locals and tourists really love it. I'm just trying to make the roads safer.

'Sometimes I turn the camera in the opposite direction, to keep people guessing.

'We haven't had any birds nesting in it yet, they seem to prefer the trees nearby- but plenty of small songbirds have stopped by for a visit.'

It is not illegal to put up a fake speed camera, as long as it is on the resident’s property. 

Police Scotland and Stirling Council were unavailable for a comment.
