These pictures allegedly show injuries suffered by workers enduring terrible conditions at a company which makes touch screens for Apple.

The images have been released by a protest group which accuses Biel Crystal of committing labour rights abuses at its factory in Hezhou, China.

Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour (SACOM) claim staff work excessively long hours and there had been a high number of work-related injuries at the factory.

The group also alleges that a number of staff had committed suicide at the plant in the last two years.

Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour claim staff work excessively long hours and that there has been a high number of work-related injuries at the company's plant

The
 pictures, which cannot be verified, were released today as SACOM held a
 protest outside Hong Kong's flagship Apple store in the International 
Finance Centre shopping mall.

SACOM
 posted a statement on its website entitled 'No more bloodstained cover 
glass on iPhones! Biel Crystal, Stop bloody exploitation now!' detailing the results of an investigation over the summer.

It
 says: 'This summer, SACOM conducted investigative research into 
the labour condition in Hong Kong-owned Apple supplier – Biel Crystal’s 
Huizhou factory and discovered numerous labour abuses and violation of 
Chinese Labour Law.

'SACOM
 decided to publish the investigation result and file complaint 
officially to the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC).'

It
 claims staff were made to sign 'blank contracts' and forced to work 11 
hours a day, seven days a week with only a 24-hour break at the end of 
month.

It also alleges that workers did not get fair compensation and claimed five suicides had taken place in the factory since 2011.

Hong Kong-based firm Biel Crystal reportedly makes touch screens for around 60 per cent of Apple's products.

According to Biel Crystal's website, the company employs more than 60,000 workers and has more than 15 production lines.

It says: 'Biel Crystal commits to provide the best services with the most competitive price to our customers.

'We have provided our products to the industry leader in watches, mobile phone, tablet and notebook.

'With the latest technology, experienced 
and skillful engineers, we can co-develop the cutting edge products with
 our customers and make it feasible to produce in mass volume.'

Claims: The group also alleges that several Biel Crystal staff have committed suicide

Apple did not provide an official 
comment on the allegations but referred MailOnline to its 'Supplier 
Responsibility Progress Report', which states: 'For the past seven 
years, Apple has been publishing reports on the audits we perform in our
 supply chain.

'We do this 
because we believe in honestly sharing our findings — the good and the 
bad. We’re fixing problems and tackling issues that our entire industry 
faces, such as excessive work hours and underage labor.

'We’re going deeper into the supply chain
 than any other company we know of, and we’re reporting at a level of 
detail that is unparalleled in our industry.

It continues: 'To end the practice of excessive overtime, we now track weekly work hours for one million workers across our supply chain and publish the results on our website every month.

'And we share our work-hour strategy and tools with others inside and outside our industry. Although underage labor is rare in our supply chain, we report all incidents we find, as well as the actions taken to correct problems and prevent future occurrences.'

Biel Crystal is not mentioned in the report.

The claims by SACOM come four months after another labour rights group accused a Chinese company that makes iPhones for Apple of abuses including withholding pay and excessive working hours.

China Labour Watch said it found violations of the law and of Apple's pledges about working conditions at factories operated by Pegatron, a Taiwanese company.

Apple said in a statement it was 'committed to providing safe and fair working conditions' and would investigate the claims about Pegatron.

Apple said it had published a code of conduct for its suppliers and joined the Fair Labour Association, a worker rights monitoring group.

The Taiwanese company's chief executive, in a separate statement, also promised to investigate.

Two years ago, SACOM also revealed that factories making Apple iPads and iPhones in China were forcing staff to sign pledges not to commit suicide after at least 14 workers at Foxconn factories had killed themselves in just 16 months as a result of horrendous working conditions.

A report commissioned by the computer giant also found in March last year that factory staff were working exhausting hours for low pay.

The
 inquiry, set up by Apple after a series of suicides at its Chinese 
factories, revealed employees often worked more than 76 hours a week and
 11 days in a row.

The 
investigation, which was run with America's Fair Labour Association, 
found 'significant' failings at three Chinese plants run by Foxconn, a 
major supplier for Apple which also makes half of the world's consumer 
electronics.
