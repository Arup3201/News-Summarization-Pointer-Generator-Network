Keep your friends close and your enemies closer, the old adage goes.

And this week, it paid off for one shop assistant.

An attempted robber marched into a Quick Save store in a balaclava in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, on Thursday.

But CCTV footage shows him stop, look at the clerk, and give a thumbs up.

Not today: This man walked into a Quick Save saying he was going to rob it but left because he knew the clerk

'I was gonna rob this place, but I know you,' he explains from across the store.

His face still covered, he adds: 'Do you know me?'

The clerk replies: 'No.'

'Good,' he says, throwing another thumbs up before exiting calmly.

Colorado police say a man matching the same description later robbed a 7-Eleven nearby.
