Wrapped in each others' arms for comfort, these are the heartbroken parents saying farewell to their young son whose organs will save the lives of others in China.

Parents Huang Yun and Liu Pingfen gathered at the bedside of their 15-month-old toddler Huang Zihan after he was injured in a car crash as they drove back from holiday.

The grief-stricken couple had a tearful final meeting with their son at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University in Chengdu before he died.

Doctors in the West China Hospital of Sichuan University bow their heads as they hold a mourning ritual for the boy after his life support ends 

The family had been on holiday in Xichang and on the last day of their trip had visited a Spring Festival.

But while driving back from the outing, the vehicle they were travelling in overturned into a 10-metre deep river valley when they were passing a bridge.

Toddler Zihan was severely injured and was declared brain dead on arrival in hospital.

Zihan's parents had to make the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support after there was nothing more doctors could do 

His parents then had to make the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life-support after there was nothing more doctors could do for him.

But despite their pain, the couple made the decision to allow the child's organs to be donated.

And soon after they learned that by allowing the donations, they have saved the life of a child at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, who successfully accepted the liver.

After agreeing to allow their son's organs to be donated, they then learned that his liver had already saved the life of another child in need of a transplant 

Organ donations are not widespread as many Chinese believe they will be reincarnated after death and therefore feel the need to keep a complete body.

But the country has introduced a new donation system where around 1,500 people donated organs in 2014, more than the total for the previous four years.

An estimated 300,000 patients are put on a waiting list every year in China for organ transplants but only around one in 30 will ultimately receive a new organ.
