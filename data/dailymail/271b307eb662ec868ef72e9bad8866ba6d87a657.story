Summer holidays in 2015 could cost just half as much as they did this year thanks to low oil prices and the global upturn.

Some airfares for next year have already been slashed by up to half - and experts say the discounts will even cover the Easter and summer holidays, which is expected to be warmly welcomed by parents.

Experts say a combination of the current strength of the pound, the Government's decision to scrap air passenger duty for children and falling oil prices reducing airlines' fuel costs all mean the savings could last well into the summer.

Some airfares for next year have already been slashed by half thanks to low oil prices and the global upturn

People are expected to start booking their holidays for 2015 as early as Boxing Day.

Bargains available include huge savings on winter breaks to Florida, Mexico and Greece, and Easter flights to Spain being cut to almost half price compared to this year's prices.

Other savings include £50 flights to Prague, Barcelona, Morocco, Portugal and Prague. 

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said lower oil prices and stronger worldwide financial growth are the main reasons for the savings.

They say consumers will benefit 'substantially' from the stronger industry performance as lower industry costs and efficiencies are passed over to holidaymakers in the form of savings.

After adjusting for inflation, average return airfares excluding taxes and surcharges are expected to fall by 5.1 per cent compared to 2014 prices.  

The savings come just weeks after George Osborne announced in the Autumn statement that families with children will save hundreds of pounds on the cost of their holidays after he axed taxes on flights.

The Chancellor abolished air passenger duty on all flights for children under the age of 12. 

Mr Osborne’s Autumn Statement announcement is a major boost for families who are hit by higher holiday costs during term time - and if deals do cover the school holidays in 2015 parents can expect to make substantial savings.

Joel Brandon-Bravo, UK managing director of Travelzoo, has said low air fare prices mean people can expect competitive deals and offers in 2015

The £50 million tax break cuts £138 from the price of a family of four's holiday to North America – and almost £200 for a family of four travelling to Australia. 

From May 1, a family of five flying to Florida could save £213, or £71 for each child under 12.

It will also reduce the cost of a family holiday to Spain by £26. 

The tax currently adds between £13 and £97 to the cost of a flight, depending on how far the final destination is from London.

Joel Brandon-Bravo, UK managing director of Travelzoo, told the Sunday Express: 'With the low air fare prices we are seeing for the new year, early 2015 is set to kick off with some great travel offers.' 

Tony Tyler, IATA's Director General and CEO said: 'The industry outlook is improving. The global economy continues to recover and the fall in oil prices should strengthen the upturn next year.  

'The industry story is largely positive, but there are a number of risks in today's global environment—political unrest, conflicts, and some weak regional economies- among them. 

'But stronger industry performance is good news for all.

'It's a highly competitive industry and consumers—travellers as well as shippers—will see lower costs in 2015 as the impact of lower oil prices kick in.

'A healthy air transport sector will help governments in their overall objective to stimulate the economic growth needed to put the impact of the global financial crisis behind them at last.'

The Association for British Travel Agents, estimate four million people will fly abroad this Christmas and New Year with today and next Sunday the peak days for travel.

A spokesman said: 'Millions of people will be leaving the country through the major airports, including Heathrow where 1.7 million people are estimated to be leaving, 800,000 will fly from Gatwick, 430,000 from Stansted and around 380,000 will leave from Manchester, 160,000 from Birmingham, 100,000 from Bristol, and 50,000 from Leeds Bradford International.'
