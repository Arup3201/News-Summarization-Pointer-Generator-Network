One of Nevada's largest and most elaborate brothels is now offering 'legal, safe and STD-free' package deals for those keen to indulge in 'a pay-for-play erotic vacation'.

For $2,100, visitors to Sheri's Ranch just outside Pahrump can enjoy a two-night stay that includes transportation from Las Vegas, dinner with the 'Sheri's lady of your choice', a souvenir from the gift shop, and a $2,000 voucher for  the hotel's other 'services'.

The upgraded $3,200 package includes all of the above plus an extra night at the hotel, an dinner of steak and lobster inside a themed bungalow, champagne and an open bar, and a 'guaranteed sex ticket' worth $3,000.

George Flint, a longtime lobbyist for the Nevada Brothel Owners Association, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the latest move by Sheri's could be a make-or-break moment for the business.

He explained that Nevada's licensed brothels are struggling against a background of recession, the rise of the Internet and high gas prices. They also face tough competition from an unchecked illegal sex trade in Clark County, which is one of five Nevada counties where brothels are outlawed.

'The brothel industry is about as badly bent as I've ever seen it,' Mr Flint added. 'I don't know that the industry as we know it is going to survive.'

According to the newspaper, since Chuck Lee bought Sheri's and the 310 acres surrounding it in 2001, he has poured an estimated $20 million into the property, adding seven standard hotel rooms and three themed suites, a swimming pool, sports bar and a restaurant.

Then in 2012, the legal brothel opened six fantasy bungalows called 'Sheri's Playland' 'to provide highly detailed and immersive erotic role play scenarios'.

Mr Flint said he is impressed by  Sheri's and believes it has developed into a place capable of attracting sex tourists from across the country and around the world. 

'I think you're going to see more of this sort of thing,' he added.
