A couple of bank robbers apparently showed off their ill-gotten gains by posing with the loot on Facebook.

Marcus Kalani Watson and Rogussia Eddie Allen Danielson from Hawaii posted pictures of themselves holding thick wads of cash just days after they're accused of commuting armed robbery, police say.

Watson, 19, who goes by the name Kiki Seui, was indicted by the FBI as the 'mastermind' of the series of armed robberies targeting Oahu banks and a recycling center.

Rogussia Eddie Allen Danielson who goes by Eddie Danielson, posted himself on Facebook June 12 with cash he allegedly stole during bank robberies, an FBI affidavit said

However, Watson posted a picture himself holding two thick wads of cash and made it his cover photo on Facebook, two days after his first alleged armed robbery at a recycling center in April.

According to an affidavit, wearing a black ski mask and brown hooded jacket, Watson brandished a black semi automatic pistol, and pointed a gun at both employees.

Scared for their lives, or at the very least getting injured, the employees handed over more than $500 in cash.

The following month, Watson allegedly robbed the Wahiawa branch of American Savings Bank walking away with nearly $7,000.

Police say the men went on a crime spree in April and May. Surveillance pictures showed the heavily armed, masked men terrorizing bank tellers while stealing tens of thousands of dollars

He is then accused of boarding a city bus and watching as the police sped to the scene. He then apparently spent the money on a Lexus and root canal.

Less than two weeks later, Watson got together with Danielson, 19, to allegedly rob another American Savings Bank.

They allegedly entered wearing masks and holding a shot gun. This time it is alleged they got away with almost $22,000.

Both the crooks posted photos of themselves on Facebook, fanning out the cash they stole.

By the end of the month, the pair hadÂ  recruited a third member to their team, 18-year-old AJ Williander, and decided to rob another branch of the American Savings Bank, making off with $11,500, police say.

Honolulu police then brought in the FBI.

An informant gave police further information apparently because he was concerned about Watson's violent talk.

Able to pinpoint their suspect, the FBI then followed Watson as he traveled to California and back to see his family.

Police and the FBI say the men in the pictures were identified through a confidential source and DNA evidence then confirmed their involvement

Honolulu Police Chief Louis Kealoha says Hawaii is safer now that these men have been caught

Unbeknownst to him, FBI agents sat beside him throughout the flight to ensure public safety.

When the plane landed, the agents arrested him along with Williander who was waiting to pick up him up at the airport.

The third suspect, Danielson was apprehended later at his home without incident.

FBI Special Agent James Mitchell of the Criminal Enterprise Squad said a confidential informant as well as witnesses and public records were used to crack the case.

He wrote: 'Federal law enforcement worked closely with local law enforcement to solve the case through use of technology and 'good old fashioned police work.'

'It was through the use of modern technology and some good old fashioned police work that resulted in the identification of these three perpetrators,' said U.S. Attorney Florence Nakakuni.

The men are suspected of robbing a Reynolds Recycling Center in April, and then holding up three banks in May

FBI Special Agent in Charge Viva Bottom said: 'Solving these robberies was a particular priority for the FBI and the Honolulu Police Department because of the escalated level of threatened violence involved.'

All three defendants could face up to 20 years in prison for each count against them.

Honolulu Police Department Chief Louis Kealoha said: 'Honolulu is definitely safer now that these three suspects are in custody.'
