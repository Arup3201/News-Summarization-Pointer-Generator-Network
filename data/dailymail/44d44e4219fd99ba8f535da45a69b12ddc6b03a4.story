The sell-out night claims to offers students the 'best night of their lives'.

Many of the women wore tiny shorts and ripped t-shirts as those taking part in the event were able to enjoy the warm evening after
 Britain experienced its hottest day of the year so far yesterday.

Some of the partygoers took a tumble and fell on the cobbled streets as a number of women struggled to stay upright in their heels.

A number of the students meanwhile called it a night at around 4am and poured into local take-away shops.

Police and paramedics were on hand throughout the night and kept a close eye on the event.

The
 Carnage UK events are run by Varsity Leisure Group, a 
multi-million-pound business that puts on hundreds of pub crawls 
throughout Britain.

Previous themes for the event have included 'Playboys vs Bunnies', 'Nympho Nurses And Dirty Doctors' and 'Pimps And Hoes'

Organisers have been criticised in the past for encouraging binge drinking and anti-social behaviour.

But founder Paul Bahia, a Birmingham University graduate, has previously denied this, insisting the events are 'heavily focused on group identity, social and ethical cohesion and fancy dress themes'.
