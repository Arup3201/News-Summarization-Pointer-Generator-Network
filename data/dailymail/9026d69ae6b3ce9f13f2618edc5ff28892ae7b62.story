The Football Association has charged Dagenham midfielder Joss Labadie with violent conduct following an incident involving Stevenage defender Ronnie Henry.

The 24-year-old, who has been banned for biting before, was accused of sinking his teeth into the hand of Stevenage defender Ronnie Henry during Saturday's League Two fixture at the Lamex Stadium.

The pair clashed near the touchline when Henry tried to wrestle the ball out of Labadie's arms after play had been stopped. Henry immediately appeared to signal to the nearby assistant referee that he had been bitten.

‘The FA has charged Dagenham & Redbridge player Joss Labadie with violent conduct following an incident during their game on 21 March 2015,’ said a statement on the FA website. ‘Labadie has until 6pm on March 30 to respond to the charge.’

Dagenham have since said that Labadie denies the accusation but Stevenage boss Graham Westley revealed after the match that Henry, 31, had suffered 'a nasty injury' and had 'nearly lost his finger'.

Police are continuing to make inquiries into the alleged incident, a Hertfordshire Police spokesperson added: 'Hertfordshire Constabulary is aware of an alleged incident that took place between two football players during the Dagenham vs Stevenage match at the Stevenage FC ground on Saturday, March 22. Police are making inquiries into the incident.'

Labadie was fined £2,000 and banned for 10 games for biting Chesterfield's Ollie Banks while playing for Torquay in February 2014.
