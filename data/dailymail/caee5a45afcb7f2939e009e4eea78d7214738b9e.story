Children's education in is under threat in some subjects from teachers who fail to achieve top qualifications, an independent report has concluded.

Barely half of trainee science and IT teachers hold a 2:1 degree or better, while the figure is around 60 per cent for maths.

This compares to 83 per cent of history trainees, 78 per cent in English and 88 per cent in classics.

The University of Buckingham’s Centre for Education and Employment Research’s Good Teacher Training Guide warned there was a lack of good quality qualifications ‘where arguably subject expertise as measured by degree class is especially important’.

One in ten of the 36,898 people in their final year of teacher training in 2011-12 were also found to have failed to achieve Qualified Teacher Status.

A quarter were without a job six months after qualifying, although the report noted the ‘wasteful loss’ was a five per cent improvement on the previous year.

Almost 81 per cent of those who trained in schools - a route growing rapidly under Education Secretary Michael Gove - found employment, compared to 76 per cent who took university-led courses.

The government has been trying to attract more top graduates into teaching with bursaries worth up to £25,000 for high-fliers.

Report author Professor Alan Smithers said: ‘There are already major shortfalls of maths, physics, ICT and modern languages teachers, which school-led programmes show no sign of ameliorating.’
