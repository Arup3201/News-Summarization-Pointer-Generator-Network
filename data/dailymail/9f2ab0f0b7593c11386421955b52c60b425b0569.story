South Yorkshire Police are investing an assault on Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Chris Kirkland  by a fan during the Yorkshire derby with Leeds United.

Michael Tonge's equaliser for visitors Leeds saw a fan in the away section run from behind Kirkland’s goal and push him to the ground.

Approaching from Kirkland’s left, the thug ran up to him and caught him unawares with a double-fisted blow
 that floored Sheffield Wednesday keeper.

Disgrace: The fan caught Sheffield Wednesday keeper Chris Kirkland flush in the face with a sickening assault

South Yorkshire Police issued a statement on Saturday morning which indicated they know the identity of the individual involved, who ran back into the stand after the assault and escaped arrest.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Inspector Mark Monteiro said: 'With the public's assistance we have clearly identified the offender who ran onto the pitch during last night's game between Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United and who is suspected of assaulting the Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper.

'We are dealing with the complaint made by the player and are currently taking statements, collating evidence and making enquiries to locate and arrest the offender.

'We are also using CCTV footage from around the ground to identify suspects who may have been responsible for other offences before, during or after the match.'

The suspect was widely named on social media sites last night, and if it proves to be him, he has previous convictions for football-related violence, and is currently serving a nationwide ban on visiting any football stadium in the country.

Leeds manager Neil Warnock was furious after the match and said he was 'absolutely embarrassed' by the incident. 'I thought it was an absolute disgrace,' he said. 'I think they should get the guy and prosecute him and put him in prison

'He (Kirkland) went down like a ton of bricks but that doesn't make a difference. Nobody should be on the pitch doing that. I hope we can make an absolute issue of it. He spoiled everything for everyone. I've not enjoyed that when I see a moron like that.

'I am not proud of being Leeds manager when I see that. I don't mind the rivalry between us - there was a great atmosphere. To see things like that on the field of play there is no place for it - I am absolutely embarrassed.'

Vicious: The fan grimaces as he goes in to attack Kirkland

He continued: 'They had enough security.

'If they have got a person like him 
with a five-year-old mentality they can't stop that. Sheffield Wednesday
 can't do anything about. It just gives them more opportunity to have a 
go.

'Dave (Jones, Wednesday manager) was 
saying we shouldn't thank the crowd but our crowd were fantastic but 
we've got one moron and I can't tolerate that.

'I've not seen anything like that 
since my mate Paul Evans got something thrown at him at Burton Albion in
 an FA Cup game many, many years ago. All of them apart from one moron were excellent tonight.'

Furious Wednesday boss Jones described the Leeds fans as: ‘Vile 
animals... an absolute disgrace,’ and said they should be banned from 
every away ground.

There were offensive chants from both 
fans during the game, about 
Jimmy Saville from travelling Leeds fans, with Sheffield Wednesday 
supporters singing songs that referenced the two Leeds fans who were 
killed in Turkey in 2000.

Rio Ferdinand ‏(@rioferdy5)Wow, watching the Sheff Weds vs Leeds game....that fan is a disgrace. Shocking. Been a good game too.

Gary O'Neil (‏@Gazoneil)Wow what have I just seen on my tv! Absolute disgrace. #leedsfan

Kyle Walker (‏@kyle28walker)The fan could have had anything on him great goal ruined but a silly man. These things should happen anymore

Phil Neville (@fizzer18)Can't believe what I've just seen in the Sheffield wed vs Leeds game!

Michael Owen (@themichaelowen)Got to feel for Leeds fans. 1 idiot gives the rest of them a bad name. Same thing happens when a footballer steps out of line.

Matt Taylor (@Official_MattT)Absolute disgrace what that Leeds fan did tonight. I could not believe my eyes. Kirkland did well not to retaliate #noplaceforthatinfootball

Minutes after the full-time whistle, Leeds United released a statement promising to work with the police to identify the man responsible for the sickening attack.

South Yorkshire Police have confirmed in a statement they 'will be working with both clubs to identify and quickly bring to justice the personsresponsible'.

In his post-match press conference, Warnock stood by his club's statement and called on the culprit to be jailed.

'It's just so sad and disappointing. If anything it stopped us winning the game. I thought at 1-1 we would get in the driving seat and that made everyone... for one moron,' he said.

'The club has made a statement and I'm pleased, we don't condone that. I hope the authorities and constabulary take the appropriate action.'

A spokesman for Leeds United said: 'Leeds would like to apologise and condemn the actions of the fan who came into the pitch and attacked Chris Kirkland. The club will fully cooperate with both the police and the football authorities in identifying the individual concerned.' 

Having sensed a tense atmosphere in the first half, Warnock also claimed to have asked police if they wanted him to address Leeds' fans in order to calm tempers.

'There were some early on, they (the fans) went towards each other, the police said they didn't think it would be right. It looked to me.... I was disappointed in certain aspects of being manager tonight when things like that happen,' he said.

'I did say to the police, in the first half, did they want me to go over and calm them down but they said that might inflame it even more.'

He did not agree with Jones' assessment that he was in the wrong to send his players to clap the travelling fans, though.

He said: 'I disagree, Dave is disappointed with not winning the game. I understand his feelings being a manager, it's a pressure game, he felt they could have won it.

'Leeds United coming was the best thing that could have happened to him, if it was a lesser team coming, on the run that they're on, it would have been very difficult, but the crowd lifted them.'

This incident will be an embarrassment
 for the FA as it comes three days after their complaint about the 
unruly and racist behaviour of Serbian fans, players and officials after
 England’s Under 21 victory.

As Kirkland lay flat out on his 
goalline, seats that had been ripped out at the away end rained down on 
to the Wednesday six-yard area. As the assailant clambered back over the
 barriers and reclaimed his seat, team-mates and physios rushed to 
Kirkland’s aid.

When he finally climbed to his feet 
and signalled he was able to continue, he turned to the travelling fans 
and pointed an angry finger towards them.

Pain: Kirkland holds his face after the incident

Tension between rival supporters had 
threatened to boil over minutes earlier, but a flashpoint that involved a
 shameful physical attack on a player is sure to land Leeds in trouble 
with the authorities, who will launch an immediate enquiry into it.

Jay Bothroyd had already made it an uncomfortable return to his native Sheffield for Neil Warnock.

Bothroyd, a deadline-day loan signing 
from one-time Sheffield United boss Warnock’s former club QPR, steered a
 44th-minute header past Paddy Kenny’s despairing dive to give Wednesday
 a deserved lead.

Wednesday boss Jones bemoaned his
 side’s recent misfortune in his programme notes, and he had more 
grounds for complaint as Wednesday dominated the first-half. Third from 
bottom at the outset, Wednesday belied their lowly position with some 
fluent passing that lacked only a finishing touch.

Treatment: Leeds fans chant and jeer while Kirkland lies injured

How it went unrewarded for so long 
took some explaining, though, after a remarkable 10th-minute escape for 
ex-Sheffield United keeper Paddy Kenny and a glaring blunder by referee 
Eddie Ilderton.

Bothroyd’s 30-yard shot almost 
embarrassed Kenny but the crossbar came to his rescue after he spilled 
the striker’s strike. As Wednesday continued to press, they were denied a
 clear penalty when Luciano Becchio dived full-length and palmed away a 
Bothroyd corner with his right hand.

Bothroyd finally made Wednesday 
pressure pay, following a 44th-minute long throw from Michail Antonio. 
The striker rose highest, and though his header lacked venom, it was 
directed well enough to defeat Kenny’s dive.

Ripped down: A sign is torn from its berth at Hillsborough

As he celebrated the breakthrough, 
Bothroyd appeared to be struck by a missile from the Leeds end. It was 
not the only unsavoury note of a first half that often threatened to 
boil over.

Michael Brown was guilty
 of overreacting after Miguel llera barged into him on the edge of the 
area. The Leeds midfielder went down clutching his face, despite contact
 appearing to be with his shoulder.

Ilderton took no action, but may well 
have punished Llera for another flashpoint, when the central defender 
floored Becchio with what looked like a forearm smash.

El Hadji Diouf was being barracked 
more than any of the former Sheffield United players on view, and he 
duly played up to the role of villain in a running verbal battle with 
Ilderton over a series of decisions. 

But for all the aggression shown on
 the pitch it is the actions of one crazed individual which will occupy 
the football authorities as they investigate the end to a troubling 
week.
