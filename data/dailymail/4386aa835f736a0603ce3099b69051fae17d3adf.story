LA Galaxy head coach Bruce Arena broke down in tears live on TV while talking about the retirement of star player Landon Donovan.

Donovan, who was left out of Jurgen Klinsmann's Team USA squad for the World Cup in Brazil this summer, announced on Thursday that he is set to retire at the end of the current MLS season.

After hearing the news Arena, who first worked with the 32-year-old at the 2002 World Cup, paid tribute to the man widely considered to be the USA's greatest ever footballer.

But, when asked about the player's personal impact on his coach, Arena broke down, as he seemingly failed to come to terms with the question.

'There are people in our lives that make a difference, and he has as a player, and as a person,' said Arena.

'I’ve seen him as a young kid, now I see him as a man, seeing him at the end of a career.'

'It’s unbelievably ironic that I’ve seen him as a baby in this sport and now a man that’s leaving.'

'To see the joy he had today and also to witness the suffering he’s experienced throughout his career…to see that range of emotions and now to see that he’s happy again, it’s emotional to me.'

Donovan has been with the Galaxy since 2005, and will retire at the end of the current MLS season.
