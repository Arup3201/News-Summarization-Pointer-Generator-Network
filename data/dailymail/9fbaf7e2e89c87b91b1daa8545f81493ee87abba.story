The mother of an eighth grade student has reacted angrily after her son got detention for sharing his lunch with a school friend.

Sandy Bradford's son Kyle, 13, shared his chicken burrito with a friend at Weaverville Elementary School in California because he didn't like the cheese sandwich he was given by the cafeteria.

But shortly after the teenager did the good deed he was given a detention slip by teachers who told him off for sharing his snack.

Anger: Sandy Bradford, Kyle's mom reacted angrily after her son got detention for sharing his lunch

Discipline: The detention note explains 'Kyle came through the line and got a lunch then while at the table gave it to another student. Policy is no sharing food, which he is fully aware of'

Bradford told KRCR-TV: ‘It seemed like he couldn't get a normal lunch so I just wanted to give mine to him because I wasn't really that hungry and it was just going to go in the garbage if I didn't eat it.’

However, the Trinity Alps Unified School District said it has regulations that prohibit students from sharing their meals.

The detention note explains: 'Kyle came through the line and got a lunch then while at the table gave it to another student. Policy is no sharing food, which he is fully aware of.' 

According to the district, students can have allergies that another student may not be aware of and this is why they limit food swaps at lunchtime.

Tom Barnett, the Superintendent of the Trinity Alps Unified School District said that they also enforced the rule for hygiene.

He said: ‘We have a policy that prohibits students from exchanging meals. Of course if students are concerned about other students not having enough to eat we would definitely want to consider that, but because of safety and liability we cannot allow students to actually exchange meals.’

Weaverville Elementary: The school is sticking by its policy which prohibits students from exchanging meals

However, Kyle’s mother Sandy is standing by her son's decision.

She thinks that he did the right thing by sharing his lunch. 

She told KRCR-TV: 'I feel very angry because he was doing the right thing and he was being kind and considerate and he was punished for it.'

She also believes that it isn't up to the school to discipline her son for good manners.

‘By all means the school can teach them math and the arithmetic and physical education, but when it comes to morals and manners and compassion, I believe it needs to start at home with the parent,’ she said.

And the 13-year-old has not been put off sharing. He said he would share his lunch again in a heartbeat if his friend was hungry.
