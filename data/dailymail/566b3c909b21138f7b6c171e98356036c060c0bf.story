As an Olympic diver, there is no doubting he has a head for heights.

But on this occasion, Tom Daley looked a little more apprehensive than usual.

The 20-year-old diver was taking a ride on Falcon's Fury, the new ride at Florida's Busch Gardens theme park.

The ride stands at 335ft high (102 metres) with riders dropping 60mph straight down, face first. It is the tallest freestanding rollercoaster structure in North America.

And Tom's trepidation is probably understandable – it is ten-times higher than his usual diving board height.

Tom was joined on the ride, opened in May, by his best friend Sophie Lee. Sophie starred alongside him in TV show Tom Daley Goes Global.

Riders are seated upright and whisked to the top of the 335-foot tower before the seat pivots 90 degrees so the guest is looking straight down. The ride then plunges in a six-second free fall.

Tom described the ride as 'awesome'.

Jeff Hornick, director of design and engineering at Busch Gardens, said: 'It's a different kind of thrill ride than a roller coaster. 

'It's really polarizing. You're either really going to want to ride it or not want to ride it at all.'

Park officials say it's the tallest, free-standing drop tower in North America and the only one in the world to feature forward tilting seats.

Hornick says guests can see downtown Tampa and even St. Petersburg, some 30 miles away from the top of the ride.

Once riders get to the top of the tower, a computer program determines how long it stays at the peak before the gut-wrenching plunge. 

Hornick said the wait time at the top will be randomised, anywhere from one to five seconds.

During the drop, riders will experience an estimated G-force of 3.5gs.

Falcon's Fury is the centerpiece of a newly designed section in the park called Pantopia

Engineers had to drive 105 steel support beams as deep as 205ft into the ground before fusing them together with a concrete cap to make it secure.

A 4ft-thick base also secures the steel tower to the foundation.

Falcon's Fury is the centerpiece of a newly designed section in the park called Pantopia that includes new retail and food areas.

The park wanted more of a scary, thrill ride to debut this year following a few years of new family friendly rides and stage shows.

'Drop towers have been popular at theme parks for many years, but what you see with Falcon's Fury is the industry's relentless drive for innovation,' said Jeremy Schoolfield, editor-in-chief of Funworld Magazine.

'Ride designers are always looking for new twists on classic attractions, and Fury's pivoting seats certainly fit that bill.

'Putting riders in a facedown position as they drop toward the ground is definitely a new take on this type of ride.'

There are taller drop towers in the U.S., but they are integrated with other rides or buildings.

Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Magic Mountain in California has a 400-foot drop and the Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey will have a 415-foot drop when it's constructed later this year. 

Both of those are attached to other rides. A famous drop tower is the Big Shot, the ride atop the Stratosphere hotel and casino in Las Vegas that catapults riders 160 feet in the air.
