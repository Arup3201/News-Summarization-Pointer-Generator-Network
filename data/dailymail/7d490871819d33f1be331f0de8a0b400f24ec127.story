The QPR squad have been in charitable mood this week. Harry Redknapp's squad may be bottom of the Premier League table but that hasn't stopped them giving generously to a good cause. 

Redknapp's side have got together and donated £30,000 to Action Aid to help fight the spread of Ebola.

The virus has killed at least 4,950 people in the world's worst Ebola epidemic since the disease was identified in 1976.

QPR striker Charlie Austin revealed that the squad thought up the idea of raising money towards the worthy cause after training during the week.

‘A little while ago we came off the training ground and Karl Henry and Steven Caulker had come up with the idea of donating some money to this cause,’ Austin told Sportlobster.com. 

‘We all spoke about it as a group in the dressing room, and chose Action Aid's Ebola Crisis Appeal as something we wanted to donate the money too, along with a donation to Macmillan Cancer Research.

‘Full credit must go to Karl and Caulks for coming up with the idea.

QPR striker Charlie Austin hailed fellow players Karl Henry and Steven Caulker for coming up with the idea 

‘Nobody hesitated to get involved, and rightly so. I'm proud that everyone in the QPR squad was so quick to agree to doing this and hopefully it will go some way to helping people who have been affected by this disease. 

‘Ebola isn't just affecting adult's lives, it is affecting children's lives too, and if this money can help then I'm glad to be able to contribute to the cause, as are the rest of the lads.

‘Who knows, maybe it might start a chain reaction amongst other team's in the Premier League. That's not what we set out to do, but maybe others will follow suit. If it takes off, then great.'

Harry Redknapp's side are currently bottom of the Premier League ahead of Saturday's crucial contest

‘As for the football, this weekend we've got a massive, massive game against Leicester,’ Austin added.

‘Not much needs to be said about the importance of this one, you all know what it means to us. It's going to be an amazing atmosphere at Loftus Road. We need to at the top of our game, and we need the fans to make it as difficult as possible for our opponents, just as you always do. We need a win, and will do everything we can to get one.’
