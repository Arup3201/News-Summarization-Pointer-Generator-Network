Developers behind Britain’s first ‘invisible’ house have revealed how the £650,000 property will be hidden from public view by cleverly-placed mirrors and state-of-the-art glass.

The two-bedroom property, which is set to be built on the site of two disused garages in Lewisham, south London, will feature glass on the upper walls in an attempt to camouflage it with its surroundings.

By reflecting images of nearby trees, the glass will disguise the outside of the three-storey property, architects JaK Studio have claimed.

Work on Britain's first 'invisible' house is set to start in the coming weeks after Lewisham Council approved plans (above)  for the unique property. Glass and mirrors will be used to hide a section of the property from view

Billed as an eco-home, the futuristic house will include a subterranean basement and a roof terrace

The developer bought the land for just £9,000 two years ago and, after the £250,000 project is complete, the house is expected to be worth £650,000.

Work on the ingenious scheme is set to start in the coming weeks, after planning permission was approved by Lewisham Council.

Owner Kevin Morton said: ‘We’d been trying to build a house in Lewisham and on this particular plot of land for a long time but given the complications faced, we were really unsure whether this would even become a reality.

‘We can now start building a house that is completely different to any of the houses in the surrounding area, or even in London itself.’

Architects JaK Studio said heat and power for the house will come from renewable energy sources while its 'super insulated' structure will cut fuel bills. It will receive further privacy from neighbours with a rooftop hedge

Architect Jacob Low said: ‘This project has certainly been an exercise in perseverance and represents a process full of dialogue with my clients, Lewisham planning department and various specialist consultants.

‘As a practice we are proud to have at last won planning on such a constrained site with a bold proposal we believe is a truly unique solution in both conceptual and planning terms.’

The project is set to be completed by next spring.
