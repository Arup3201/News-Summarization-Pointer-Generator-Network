Manchester United are the biggest club in England when it comes to crowds - both now and historically - and the joint biggest along with Liverpool when it comes to ‘star players’ in their line-ups, all-time.

Crowds and stars have been considered as part of a Sportsmail study to explore which English clubs are the ‘biggest’; 58 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been included in the study, having played in England’s top division for at least a season.

Two different measurements were used for crowds - the average gates for each club this season, plus the biggest gate each club has ever had at any point. The aim of this was to gauge not just one season but reflect former ‘greatness’ for clubs now enduring leaner times but who were authentic giants at some point.

Manchester United, averaging over 75,000 fans every game at Old Trafford, top the crowds list

This is what Maine Road looked like in 1934, the year Manchester City recorded a record attendance of 84,569

Arsenal's Emirates Stadium sees them second in attendances for this season, and fourth overall on crowds

United’s current average attendances of more than 75,000 leaves them way ahead of the field, with Arsenal in second place just below 60,000, then Newcastle (nearly 51,000), Manchester City (45,400), Liverpool (44,700), with Chelsea, Sunderland, Everton, Tottenham and West Ham filling out the top 10.

All 59 clubs in the study have been ranked on current attendances, and separately on their biggest historic gates. An aggregate of those two ranks gives the overall crowd ranking topped by United, with City in second place, then Chelsea, Arsenal and Sunderland.

City have the highest single attendance for a home club match in English football - almost 85,000 were at Maine Road for the game in question, an FA Cup tie against Stoke in 1934.

United are the club with the next biggest home record, just over 83,000 for a league match with Arsenal in 1948. 

We ranked all clubs on the size of their average gates during this season to reflect contemporary pull. Then we ranked each club by the size of their biggest historic gates. Their overall crowd rank is an aggregate of current pull and also potential based on past highs.

Incidentally, this was also played at Maine Road, which United were using at that time because Old Trafford had been so damaged in the blitz.

Eight other clubs also have record home attendances of more than 70,000: Chelsea, Everton, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Tottenham, Charlton, Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday and these all-time highs are reflective of these clubs having massive paying support in different eras.

AFC Wimbledon's support may be loud and loyal, but they are bottom of our list in terms of crowds

With Kingsmeadow one of the Football League's smallest grounds, AFC Wimbledon rank low on attendance

We counted the number of players from each club who have played for England, all-time, ranking the clubs by total. This reflects historic ‘bigness’. We then ranked the clubs by the number of players provided to the 2014 World Cup — a measure of modern ‘bigness’. The overall ranking is an aggregate of these two. 

To measure the amount of ‘star’ players at each club, both all-time and more recently, our study used two objective criteria - the number of players capped by England at each club, ever, and the number of players called up by their countries for the most recent World Cup.

The notion of ‘stars’ will always be subjective. That is a given. But using proxies of England players over time and World Cup players last summer allowed hard data to compare all the clubs on a like-for-like basis.

The clubs have been ranked on each criteria with an aggregate ranking to determine the ‘biggest’ clubs in terms of all-time stars.

Using this method, United and Liverpool are joint top. Liverpool have provided the third most England players, all-time (67), behind Aston Villa in first place (73) and Tottenham (71). They also provided the joint third-most players of all the clubs in the English league to the World Cup (10).

Manchester United had the most players of any English team at the World Cup, including Wayne Rooney

Liverpool were third for number of players at the World Cup, including Luis Suarez and Steven Gerrard

Fabian Delph is the only Aston Villa in the current England squad, but they top the historical list

United provided the most players to the World Cup of all English clubs (14), followed by Chelsea (12) then Liverpool, Arsenal and City on 10 each. United have provided the fifth most England players, or 65 to date. Thus both Liverpool and United’s aggregate ‘star player’ rankings are the same.

Our ‘star player’ index has Arsenal and Tottenham in joint third, followed by Everton, City and Chelsea in joint fifth, then Aston Villa in eighth, Newcastle in ninth, with West Brom and Southampton joint 10th.

The full rankings are in the tables below.
