Crayola is apologizing after hackers filled its Facebook page with off-color content.

The Forks Township, Pennsylvania-based crayon and marker manufacturer regained control of the page late Sunday and removed the offending posts.

Instead of burnt sienna and cerulean blue, the page's followers - over 2.4 million - saw cartoon breasts and sophomoric sex jokes.  

One post included a link to a drawing of a scantily clad female cartoon character from the DreamWorks  movie 'The Road to El Dorado' - with the words 'If Disney Was For Adults.'

Hacked: Crayola's Facebook page followers - over 2.4million - saw cartoon breasts and sophomoric sex jokes. This post included a link to a drawing of 'The Road to El Dorado' character Chel

Sorry: Crayola wrote online 'Our sincere apologies to our Facebook community for the inappropriate and offensive posts you may have seen here today' 

Another post included a suggestive drawing and the words 'The Story of 20 Toes told in 20 mint.'

The posts, which are now down but were preserved by AdWeek, also featured risque links to several websites. The company normally posts about its family-friendly coloring products  

Crayola tweeted on Sunday at 3:42pm 'We're aware of the situation on our official FB page, which was hacked today, and making every effort to stop the unauthorized posts.'

A few hours later, the company tweeted at 6:19pm 'We don't condone the inappropriate & offensive content being posted to the fraudulent Crayola FB page & sincerely apologize to our fans.'

The company was able to restore the page to its usual family friendliness.

On Facebook, the company wrote 'Our sincere apologies to our Facebook community for the inappropriate and offensive posts you may have seen here today. Please be assured the official Crayola page has been restored. 

It continued 'We can’t thank our fans enough for the feedback and support we received while working to resolve the issue … you truly are the best and we look forward to an exciting and creative 2015!'

Crayola LLC is a subsidiary of Kansas City, Missouri-based Hallmark Cards Inc.
