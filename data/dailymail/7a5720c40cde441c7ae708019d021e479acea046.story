A starter, main course and dessert which all come up to less than 500 calories?

It might sound impossible but restaurateurs have risen to the challenge and are now offering top-quality menus to cater to the growing number of diners keeping an eye on their calorie intake.

And while their offerings may be heavy on the fish and light on the carbs, it doesn't mean that the food served is tasteless.

Dr Michael Mosley introduced the concept of intermittent fasting two years ago

Also known as intermittent fasting, the 5:2 diet was introduced by Dr Micheal Mosley in 2013. 

He says: 'One of the main things that intermittent fasting seems to do is switch on repair genes — genes whose job it is to keep the various bits of your body in good shape. 

'The reason this happens is not fully understood; however, the evolutionary argument goes something like this. As long as we have plenty of food, our bodies remain in constant ‘go-go’ mode; it is like driving a car with your foot constantly on the accelerator.

When you fast, the body’s initial reaction is one of shock. Signals go to the brain reminding you that you are hungry, urging you to find something to eat. But you resist. The body decides there must be a famine, so there is little point wasting energy on growth: instead, it gets cracking on some of the urgent maintenance tasks that it might have been putting off.

As part of this repair process, the body breaks down and recycles old and tired cells (in a process called autophagy or ‘self eat’) getting rid of damaged or ageing parts to keep everything else in good working order.

Fasting, it seems, also sparks the production of new cells. Recently, Professor Valter Longo of the University of Southern California published a study showing, for the first time, that fasting can switch on stem cells and regenerate the immune system.

This has significance in the fight against cancer. Being able to create new white cells and build a more powerful immune system not only keeps infections at bay but also means mutating cells that might turn into a cancer are destroyed by the immune system long before they can multiply.

There were initial concerns among the scientific community that fasting could harm the immune system, because when you starve, your system tries to save energy by recycling damaged immune cells. In the long run, this would be harmful, making you more vulnerable to infections.

But Professor Longo discovered that if you fast for a very short period, and then eat, you get a re-bound effect, with the creation of new, more active cells. ‘We could not have predicted that fasting would have such a remarkable effect,’ he says.

I am now convinced that intermittent fasting could have a game-changing effect on the nation’s health.'
