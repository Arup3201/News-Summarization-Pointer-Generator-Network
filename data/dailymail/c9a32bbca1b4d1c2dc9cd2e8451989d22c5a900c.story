Sleeping four to a makeshift bed, in a sparsely furnished room these pictures portray an image of home life that is alien to us in the affluent and relatively peaceful western world.

But compared to some of their friends and loved ones, perhaps these youngsters count themselves as the lucky ones.

For they have escaped the bloody civil war that has raged in Syria for more than two years and claimed the lives of an estimated 93,000.

They are among an estimated 1.6million who have crossed borders into Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt to escape the terrible violence that has ripped their lives apart.

*****World Refugee Day: Embargo to 12.01 Thursday 20 June 2013****

Exiled: Haytham, seven,  and his brother Wassim, five, look out from inside their tent in a settlement in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley

Peacefully sleeping, these children 
may not bear any physical marks of war, but they will have to live with 
the mental torture of what they've endured for years to come.

Many are missing family members, living in makeshift camps or unfurnished rooms, but many others didn't make it.

Charity Save The Children has 
released these haunting images taken by award winning photographer Moises Saman and a report describing how injured and 
dehydrated adults and children have been dying at the side of the road 
while trying to make their escape from the country.

The release of the report coincides 
with World Refugee Day and the charity hopes they will raise the profile
 of the plight faced by Syrian children and their families.

Some of the most graphic reports 
released by the charity include a 12 year-old boy – whose mother had 
been shot - being left to bleed to death with insect-eaten shrapnel 
wounds as the group he was with were forced to abandon him and run for 
their lives.

Another tells of a baby separated from her mother and dying in the heat due to a lack of milk.

A third describes young children being trampled underfoot as desperate civilians run for their lives under shell fire.

Mohammed, a refugee who recently 
arrived in Lebanon after walking in a group of 5,000 for five days 
without food or water, described how people hid behind thin almond trees
 as they came under fire.

He said: 'Hundreds of people were injured on the road, but we couldn't take them all, we had to leave them there.

'People died on the journey, and when
 they did, we could not even bury them because the ground was too hard 
to dig a hole in. So instead we collected stones to cover their bodies.'

Syria’s one millionth refugee only crossed the border in March – two full years after the crisis took hold.

The number of registered refugees has
 increased 17-fold in the past 12 months and the two millionth refugee 
is expected to arrive this summer.

The number of people in need of 
refugee assistance from Syria has increased on average by close to a 
third each month for the past year. Were that trend to continue, Syria 
would be emptied of civilians by as early as April 2014.

Save the Children CEO Justin Forsyth 
said: 'The horrific stories we’ve gathered from refugees over the past 
few days show how children are bearing the brunt of the Syrian conflict.

'Children in Syria are being killed, 
tortured, recruited as soldiers and abused in horrifying numbers. 
Children are being separated from their parents, and some are dying 
alone at the roadside from their wounds.  

'Meanwhile conditions are proving too
 much for the weakest and most vulnerable babies. Millions of children 
are beyond the reach of humanitarian aid and have no option but to flee.

'Over half of all Syrian refugees are
 children and behind the frankly terrifying statistics of civilians 
fleeing their country are millions of individual tragedies.

Keeping warm: Faysal, six, is pictured waking up inside his family's tent a settlement in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon

'Ultimately the only solution to this
 crisis is an end to the violence in Syria, but in the meantime, we 
urgently need to be able to reach those trapped inside Syria. Unless we 
can, I am afraid we will hear more horrifying stories of children forced
 into ever more desperate circumstances.'

Children inside Syria are especially 
vulnerable to the worst atrocities of the crisis. Those who manage to 
escape often lack access to schools and safe places to play and are 
frequently living in cramped, overcrowded conditions.

As well as working with refugee 
communities in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, Save the Children is working 
across Syria to bring vital humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable 
communities.

However, due to restrictions posed by
 a lack of access, it is currently only reaching 10 percent of those 
people it aims to inside the country itself.
