The taxman is to target children with alarmist videos warning them to pay their bills when they grow up.

A film depicting HM Revenue & Customs staff chasing ‘ghosts’ – unseen tax cheats who hide billions from the Treasury – will be screened to 14 to 17-year-olds from next month in new classes on personal finance and how to contribute to society.

But James Daley, of the Fairer Finance consumer group, said: ‘Some personal finance education in schools is very useful, but trying to brainwash children into paying their tax isn’t the right way of going about it.’

The animation portrays tax inspectors as ‘ghostbusters’ hunting spooks who fail to declare money from their jobs and moonlighting workers who only pay tax on one income. After a successful chase, it ends with the tax evaders in jail.

Officials are relying on greater influence in schools as well as their traditional enforcement activities to crack down on tax evasion, which represents a loss of £36billion to the UK each year.

Jennie Granger, of HMRC, said: ‘Educating young people so they don’t get tempted is vital. We are very proud this film is part of the national curriculum.’

Critics suggested HMRC should focus on catching tax evaders rather than lecturing pupils.

Anastasia de Waal, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘The reason people don’t pay their taxes is down to loopholes and inefficiencies. Better education will help, but there are much better ways of doing it than this.’

In its fight to narrow the tax gap, schools are set to become a new battlefront for HMRC.

For the first time, financial education is now part of the compulsory National Curriculum.

Introduced in September, it forms part of Citizenship classes for 11-16-year-olds and maths for 5-14-year-olds.

The tax video - to be launched officially next month - will be broadcast as part of these.

HMRC also offers other information guides for teachers to use – mainly in paper form - to use with pupils.

These include games and tests on how to understand income tax and what your National Insurance contributions are used for.

Two years ago, it was criticised for a teaching module which encouraged students to shop tax dodgers to their teachers.

A teaching aid asked children if they could think of any activities in their local area where tax wasn’t being paid.

HMRC did not say how much the new video cost but its fight against tax fraud and evasion has already seen it spend millions setting up regional taskforces to go after industries it believes are prone to tax evasion.

These now include taxi drivers, restaurants, market stall owners and even Avon ladies.

Its pursuit of non-payment has also raised fears it is delving too deeply into people’s financial affairs.

Around 17,000 people a year would have money seized under proposed debt recovery powers - without the need for HMRC to go to court.

Official documents reveal it anticipates receiving £375million from the planned scheme between 2015 and 2019.

It claims it will always ensure its targets have at least £5,000 left over after any raid on their accounts.

But experts worry not enough safeguards will be put in place to protect innocent or vulnerable households from errors that leave them out of pocket.

Critics stress HMRC appears more interested in chasing down innocent parties than giant multinationals who pay negligible amounts of tax.
