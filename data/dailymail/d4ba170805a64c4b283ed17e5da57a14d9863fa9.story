Facebook has removed a cake decorator's pictures of a mermaid from her company profile because the drawings showed the mermaid's nipples.

Rhu Strand, 52, of Waterlooville, Hampshire, blasted the social networking site for removing the pictures, saying she was shocked to receive the e-mail from the site condemning her drawings.

According to Strand,Facebook removed the pictures after receiving a complaint from an angry member who had reported the drawing which was posted on her 'Pimp my Cake with Mama Rhu' page for being too explicit.

Only hours after, Strand received a second email saying Facebook had deemed the picture inappropriate, her picture had been taken down and she was banned from her company page for 24 hours.

The sugar paste teacher said: 'I had a new logo made for my business of a topless mermaid similar to the one I had made as a cake figurine.

'It represents an iconic old sailor tattoo as I was a REN in the Navy 30 years ago, I live in Portsmouth, the home of the Royal Navy and I met my partner while sailing.

'I posted the picture on my company Facebook page at the weekend to promote my business and I received an email less than 48 hours later saying it had been reported for nudity.

'I think it was because she was topless and it was explicit imagery.

'I have now been banned from Facebook for 24 hours, which is a bit overdramatic.

'My issue is that there are pictures out there which are far more explicit but because nipples aren’t shown in the pictures it is deemed fine for young teenagers and the like to see them.

'My friends are angry about it and will be posting classic nude pictures in protest.

'I’m going to have to change my mermaid now to having shells covering her boobs which should be fine because her nipples aren’t showing - it’s mad!'

Rhu gave up her job as a Portsmouth City Council admin assistant five years ago to set up a cake decorating and sugar figurine business.

Within the terms of Facebook it states users ‘will not post content that: is hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence’.
