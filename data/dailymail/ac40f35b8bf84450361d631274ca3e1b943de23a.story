MARGOT AT WAR: LOVE AND BETRAYAL IN DOWNING STREET 1912-16 by Anne de Courcy (Weidenfeld & Nicolson £20 )

August, 1914. As the Great Powers, including Britain, are dragged into war, the atmosphere inside No 10 Downing Street is riven with emotion. Not only, not even mainly, about the war.

The Prime Minister, Henry Asquith, is secretly madly in love with a woman less than half his age. Venetia Stanley is the closest friend of his daughter Violet; their letters to each other suggest a wild lesbian affection — ‘my darlingest, how I want you’ — or was it just their way of talking?

Violet is also deeply in love with her own father and determined to come between him and her stepmother, his second wife Margot (her own mother died young).

The Prime Minister, Henry Asquith, was secretly madly in love with a woman less than half his age, Venetia Stanley

Margot Asquith, the lavish party hostess of No 10, learns of her husband’s infatuation with Venetia and confesses her jealous misery to her confidante, Asquith’s young Private Secretary, Edwin Montagu. She does not realise that Edwin, too, is madly in love with Venetia, who is keeping him dangling.

None of these secret couples is able to get into bed together. The atmosphere is electric with frustrated yearnings, to which the onset of the grimmest, greatest war takes second place.

As I read on with increasing amazement at these carryings-on, the thought kept intruding: this is a plot that Downton Abbey would die for! Its participants, if not actually titled, are all rich members of the country house party set.

Margot Asquith was besieged by admirers of her wit and outrageous outspokenness for years before she married her husband

Margot’s father made his fortune in gold mines. Margot herself, meanwhile, was besieged by admirers of her wit and outrageous outspokenness for years before she married Asquith. He was then a highly successful barrister and rising politician. He was already widowed with five grown-up children and fell for her instantly.

S he was certainly no looker. Her face, badly injured in an accident while out hunting, had been left with a sharp, down-turned beak of a nose and the grim mouth of a bird of prey. To counter this she dressed superbly in the fashionably unstructured coats and skirts and extravagant hats of the day.

Venetia, her much younger rival, was the daughter of Lord Stanley of Alderley. He had a huge estate in Cheshire, where she kept a menagerie including a bear cub called Lancelot, and she carried her pet monkey Fluto wherever she went.

She was described as ‘tall, dark and handsome’, a description that fitted her strong but oddly masculine features. Asquith, with his sharp legal mind, was stocky and always looked serenely imperturbable. Margot’s riches and wild generosity had introduced him to the pleasures of rich food and drink. He liked to have daily luncheon and dinner parties followed invariably by cigars and bridge. As he drank steadily more, his House of Commons nickname was Squiffy.

His secret yearning was for sex. Margot, after a series of hard pregnancies and agonising births — only two of their five babies survived — had been told by doctors she must have no more children. Contraception in those days being quite unreliable, she had closed the bedroom door on Asquith — or anyone else. Nevertheless, he wrote frequent letters to assure her of his undying unchanging love. Meanwhile he was pouring out his slavish devotion in daily letters to Venetia: ‘I love you more than I can tell . . . I love you every hour . . . I think of you every hour . . . .you are the pole star of my life . . . my allegiance will never waver.’

As the war drew on he still wanted to tell her everything. ‘The only exciting thing in prospect, other than seeing you on Friday, is what will happen in the Dardanelles next week. This is supposed to be a secret — it is not known to some of the Cabinet’. His indiscretions were mindblowing.

Ministers at the Cabinet table grew used to being interrupted by a messenger bearing a letter for Asquith which he would open, peruse and reply to at length. He then sent for the messenger to post it to Venetia. Only then did he resume his part in the decisions affecting the life and death of thousands of men.

Venetia was the daughter of Lord Stanley of Alderley

Whatever the war situation, Asquith made time for afternoon rides with Venetia in his chauffeur-driven Napier around the London parks, their knees draped in a motoring rug. Asquith was notorious for giving any passing young woman a pat or a stroke and for taking a good look, if possible, ‘down Pennsylvania Avenue’ — between their breasts. Nowadays he would have been called ‘a groper’, a word not then in use.

There is no evidence that he ever got any further, even when both of them were weekending at the same country house. His letters hint at how much more he would have liked to enjoy of her love. But Venetia, in her late 20s, seems to have played a cool hand both with her elderly admirer (Asquith was in his 60s) and her young one, Edwin Montagu.

Edwin was extremely rich and Jewish but handicapped by a body of gangling ugliness and ‘a long bony face, pitted like the surface of the moon and sombre unhappy eyes of extraordinary intelligence’. Add to this a fierce moustache and a monocle, and one can imagine why Venetia turned away whenever he tried to embrace her.

She found him physically repulsive but intellectually exciting — he was said to be a man ‘whose ugliness was obliterated by his charm’.

Asquith made him a minister — unaware that Edwin was beseeching Venetia every week to marry him.

At long last she gave way — on conditions. First, that they would have sex only when she chose. Second, that she could have extra-marital affairs. In return she agreed to convert to Judaism — Edwin’s inheritance depended on his not ‘marrying out’.

How was she to tell Asquith? And how was he to tell Margot? Both of them had been betrayed, and Venetia knew the Prime Minister would be heartbroken to lose her. ‘Why can’t I marry you and go on making him happy?’ she wrote plaintively to Edwin. ‘I want to be happy and yet not make anyone else unhappy. It’s as tangled as ever . . . Go on loving me. Darling, I think I love you’.

A Cabinet plot by Lloyd George, the Chancellor, removed Asquith from the leadership

When she at last tied the knot, her outraged circle assumed she was being converted just for his money — £10,000 a year.

Asquith, as she had anticipated, was devastated. The blow came on top of the news that his eldest, most brilliant son, Raymond, had been killed in France. Not even he could remain imperturbably serene.

Very soon a Cabinet plot by Lloyd George, the Chancellor, removed him from the leadership. The war was being lost and Asquith was not the man to win it. Lloyd George eagerly replaced him and promptly moved his secretary/mistress, Frances Stevenson, into No 10.

Henry Asquith and his long-suffering wife Margot. Much of the book relies on her accounts of the war and the pair's relationship

Anne de Courcy keeps this steaming, erotic merry-go-round whirling with admirable skill. Using Margot’s diaries and a wealth of letters and other sources, she brings those fraught days of war alive, weaving them into their context with an immediacy of unexpected detail.

We seem to have been reliving 1914 for months. This book makes you feel you are there watching the tears fall — especially Margot’s — into the emotional cauldron bubbling out of control.

When you next look at the door of No 10, still a house of secrets, just imagine what mayhem was going on behind it 100 years ago.
