The man known to millions as Neighbours star Harold Bishop has landed himself a new role – teaching sex education.

Actor Ian Smith has been unveiled as the face of a new video series to support teachers delivering health and sexual wellness education in schools after La Trobe University discovered just 59 per cent of teens in Australia reported using condoms when they last had sex.

The 76-year-old plays a grandfather in the series called 'Ask Grandad', in which he teaches young people how to put on a condom.

In an interview with KIIS 101.1's Matt Tilley and Jane Hall, the Aussie TV legend joked: '55 years in the business and here I am teaching sex education.'

Smith explained that he was inspired to help because he never received proper sex education himself.

'It is one of my youngest memories, I asked my grandfather... and him telling me a few things about life which my parents never ever did,' Smith said.

'I remember my sex education from my father, I had just gone to bed and was reading a book when he walked in and gruffly sort of threw a soft cover book on the bed called Know Your Body and that was it,' the actor added.

Smith, who joined Neighbours as Harold Bishop in 1987 - when Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan were still in the cast - and fell in love with Madge Ramsay who was played by Anne Charleston, admitted that he got 'slightly embarrassed' while filming with condoms.

'But I thought why am I embarrassed? Do you want kids to grow up like you did?,' he told KISS 101.1.

The Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Victoria, teamed up with Ansell Healthcare to produce the Ask Grandad DVD and teaching kit.

Pamela Blackman, who is a researcher at La Trobe and a former secondary school teacher, said the resource was trialled in three schools last year and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.

'This is such a great way to stimulate discussion about safe sex – not just between teachers and their students but also between parents and their kids– and that is so important given we know about 50 per cent of young people are sexually active by year 12,' Ms Blackman said.

'Because so many of us find sex a very personal thing, teachers, students and parents often find discussing condoms awkward. However, the humour in the Ask Grandad resource alleviates much of the embarrassment.'

Smith will also soon star in Neighbours' 30th birthday episode with his deceased on-screen wife Madge set to make a return, possibly as a ghost.
