The U.S. Army made a public apology after saying the term 'Negro' was an acceptable term for black personnel back in October.

The revised policy now limits the acceptable terms to 'Black or African American.'

The decision to change the policy came two days after it was said to be an appropriate term to refer to 'a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa' in section 6-2 of the Army's AR 600-20 regulations.

Regulations:  An Army policy published as recently as October 22 said that Negro is an OK term for, 'a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa'

'The U.S. Army fully recognized, and promptly acted, to remove outdated language in Army Regulation 600-20 as soon as it was brought to our attention,' Army spokeswoman Lieutenant Colonel Alayne Conway said in a statement.

'We apologize to anyone we offended,' she said.

The New York Daily News reports that 21% of active-duty members of the Army are black.

Even the U.S Census Bureau used the term Negro on its forms up until last year.

The Census officials said that some older black Americans identify with the term but that others feel that it is outdated and offensive.  

Outdated: 'The Army takes pride in sustaining a culture where all personnel are treated with dignity and respect and not discriminated against based on race, color, religion...' said an official

CNN reported that the regulations also said that 'Haitian' is an acceptable term.

An Army spokesman named Lt. Col. S. Justin Platt came forward after CNN brought the terminology to light.

He said, 'The racial definitions in AR600-20 para. 6-2 are outdated, currently under review, and will be updated shortly.' They finally were.

'The Army takes pride in sustaining a culture where all personnel are treated with dignity and respect and not discriminated against based on race, color, religion, gender and national origin,' he added.

An Army official defended the document to CNN by saying that the word Negro must have been added to it because a man chose to 'self-report' that he liked being called by that word.

A Military officer specializing in personnel issues for the Defence Department told CNN that excuse 'the dumbest thing I have ever heard.'

He also told CNN that the Pentagon doesn't use that word in any of its far-reaching collection of demographic data.
