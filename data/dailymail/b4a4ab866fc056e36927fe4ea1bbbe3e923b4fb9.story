Two American soldiers were shot dead today by two Afghans including a man believed to be a soldier.

The attack was likely to raise further questions about the future of Afghanistan's struggling security forces.

NATO said a man in Afghan army uniform and another in civilian clothes opened fire.

The killings in the southern Kandahar 
province came after two senior U.S. officers were gunned down in the 
Afghan Interior Ministry on Saturday, allegedly by a police intelligence
official.

Five NATO soldiers have been killed by Afghan security forces since copies of the Koran were burned at a NATO base last month, triggering widespread anger and protests.

The killing of the American officers in the Interior Ministry stunned NATO and cast doubt on its strategy of replacing large combat units with advisers, as the alliance tries to wind down the war now in its 11th year.

The alliance immediately moved to withdraw all its advisers from Afghan ministries in Kabul. Britain, Germany and Canada then withdrew their officials.

The Obama administration would not swerve from plans to move into an advisory role in Afghanistan, said U.S. officials.

However Afghan officials were concerned that further attacks by home forces on Western troops could damage ties with NATO.

According to the Pentagon, some 70 members of the NATO force have been killed in 42 insider attacks between May 2007 and January 2012.

Such incidents became more frequent after the U.S. sent tens of thousands more soldiers to Afghanistan to tackle Taliban strongholds.

'There are Taliban sympathizers in uniform inside Afghan security forces who are not in fact sent or recruited by the Taliban,' said an Afghan government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

'Despite tighter vetting procedures, such unfortunate incidents do occur.

'This problem will not go away. We need more time, more resources and manpower.'

Some of Washington's partners have shown even greater sensitivity to insider attacks.

In January, French President Nicolas Sarkozy suspended training and support operations and announced that France would withdraw entirely by the end of 2013 after four French troops were killed by a rogue Afghan soldier.

The U.S. hopes Afghan forces will be able to confront the Taliban and handle security on their own before NATO combat troops' scheduled departure at the end of 2014.

Insider attacks on NATO troops have deepened concerns about the commitment and effectiveness of Afghan forces.

General Afzal Aman, head of the operations department at the Ministry of Defence, said: 'Unfortunately, this situation is a point of concern for us.'
