British Davis Cup player Dan Evans will be fined after failing to turn up for his match at this week’s lower-tier professional event on the Wirral.

The 24-year-old from Birmingham, who only a year ago looked set to crack the world’s top 100, has given no explanation for his no-show at the $15,000 Futures level tournament on Merseyside.

Evans, tagged the ‘bad boy’ of British tennis, will receive a £350 fine and face more questions about his commitment to a career that at times has shown signs of world-class potential.

The ex-British No 2 was due to play Italy’s Salvatore Caruso in Tuesday’s first round, but tournament organisers were alarmed when, in a highly unusual situation at a professional event with ranking points on offer, he was absent at the start of play.

Mystery still surrounded his absence on Thursday, with players and officials in the dark for the reasons why. ‘I can confirm Dan Evans was a no-show and was replaced in the draw,’ said a tournament spokesman.

‘He was timed out according to the standard 15-minute rule.’ With his current ranking of 688, Evans was only just inside the event’s entry cut-off but rang in on Saturday to confirm that he would be participating. It is the last anyone heard from him.

It is also understood he withdrew from a non-ranking British Tour event in his hometown of Birmingham last Friday, although that time he did notify officials.

It is the latest controversy to hit Evans, generally reckoned to have the most natural ability in Britain after Andy Murray. He has played some outstanding Davis Cup matches for GB and in 2013 nearly made the US Open fourth round. 

Admitting he sometimes struggles for motivation, Evans has been regularly dropped from LTA funding and reinstated, but is currently without support.

After last year’s Wimbledon he suffered knee problems but has played three lower-tier events in the UK this year, with the Wirral set to be his fourth.

He is said to have been training well at the high performance centre in Nottingham. At this month’s Davis Cup tie in Glasgow, GB No 4 Liam Broady said he had highly competitive practice matches against Evans, making his behaviour this week look even more enigmatic.
