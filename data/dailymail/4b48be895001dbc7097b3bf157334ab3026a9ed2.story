Friends of a 12-year-old girl who collapsed and died after she was hit in the chest by a rugby ball today described her as 'talented' and 'very popular'.

Leonie Nice appeared to suffer a fit after the ball struck her while she was playing ‘throw and catch’ in PE with friends at Woodlands School, Basildon, Essex.

She was rushed to hospital following the freak accident, which happened shortly before midday, but doctors were unable to save her.

Tragic: Leonie Nice, 12, died after being hit by a rugby ball while playing 'throw and catch' in a school PE lesson

Fellow year seven pupil Jeswin Babu, 12, described the harrowing moment she slumped to the ground in front of her classmates.

He said: 'The girls said she got hit by a rugby ball and fell over and hit her head and stopped breathing. Her face started to go blue.

'We had a special assembly and they said we could ring our parents and go home early.

'Her older sister and her best friends were taken straight to hospital by the police.

'We found out she had died when her sister posted on BBM [BlackBerry Messenger].'

He added: 'She was a good singer and liked performing arts. She was a very talented girl.

'She had loads of friends, she was very popular.

'When everyone heard that she was dead they were so upset - everybody was crying.

'She won the year seven spelling bee competition. She represented our tutor group in front of the whole school.

'She was a really intelligent and hard-working girl. She was in lots of clubs.'

Jeswin’s older brother Joel Babu, 16, said the whole school had been devastated by the tragedy.

He said: 'I saw the ambulance come and the head teacher calling the police.

'Leonie wasn’t just popular in year seven, she had friends from across the school.

'She had only been at the school for one year, but all the teachers loved her.

'They were trying to comfort the students but they were all crying too. It was such a sad moment.

'This is the first time anything like this has happened at school.'

The schoolgirl’s mother Kelley Elam, 31,
and stepfather Paul Elam, 29, an electrician, were at her side at Basildon 
Hospital when she died.

Leonie, who celebrated her birthday last month, had an older sister, Courtney, 14, and brothers Riley, ten, and Owen, four.

The exact cause of death remains unclear and a post-mortem examination is due to be held.

Leonie’s step-grandmother Valerie Elam, 51, said: ‘She really was part 
of a loving family and they are in pieces right now. They are going to 
miss her terribly.

‘Leonie was so popular at school with all her friends. She was a very, 
very affectionate girl. Her mum is struggling to keep it together and is
just spending time with her girl at the hospital while she can.

‘You really don’t expect to send your  kids to school and get that kind of  phone call.’

Heartbreaking: Leonie was taken by ambulance to Basildon Hospital where she was pronounced dead

Head teacher Andy White said: ‘Leonie keeled over and appeared to go into a fit.

‘Our trained first-aiders gave CPR at the scene and the ambulance arrived quickly.

‘Leonie was taken by ambulance to Basildon Hospital where, despite  everyone’s best efforts, she was pronounced dead.

The pupils and parents have been informed of this sad event and students
who require support are being looked after by our own staff and 
specialist staff from Essex County Council’s support team.

‘Our thoughts and prayers are with her family at this time.

‘Leonie was a promising, delightful and kind girl who will be greatly missed by all the staff and pupils.’

The cause of death remained unclear last night and a post-mortem examination is due to be held.

But news quickly spread to other schoolchildren, with one speculating 
online that the blow had cracked one of Leonie’s ribs, which had 
punctured her heart and killed her.

In rare cases, heavy blows can stop the heart. The schoolgirl may also have had an underlying health condition.

East of England Ambulance Service spokesman Gary Sanderson said: ‘First 
and foremost our thoughts are firmly with the girl’s family at this 
tragic time.

‘The ambulance crew arrived at the scene within one minute and found 
the girl in a critical condition. Following rapid treatment and 
stabilisation by the ambulance crews, she was taken to an awaiting 
medical team at Basildon Hospital where sadly she died shortly after.’

Leonie, who celebrated her birthday last month, had an older sister, Courtney, 14, and brothers Riley, ten, and Owen, four.

Friends paid tribute online to the year 7 pupil yesterday.

One girl wrote on Twitter: ‘RIP Leonie-Jo Nice; a beautiful girl, 
resting with the angels - heaven only takes the best; we all love you; 
sleep tight angel.’

Another friend posted: ‘R.i.p to our beautiful friend leonie-Jo nice,a 
stunning girl that was only young, hopes to her family, we all love you,
our gorgeous angel.’

Woodlands School, a specialist school in performing arts, has 1,500  pupils aged between 11 and 16.

Last year it was rated outstanding in an Ofsted inspection.
