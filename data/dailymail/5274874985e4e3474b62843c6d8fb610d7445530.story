Brazilian legend Cafu has tipped Liverpool's Jon Flanagan to become a great full back.

Cafu, a two-time World Cup winner and Brazil's most capped player, revealed that compatriot Lucas Leiva invited him to Liverpool's final game of the season against Newcastle, and it was during the 2-1 victory that he first saw Flanagan play.

He was suitably impressed with the 21-year-old dubbed the 'Scouse Cafu' and believes that Flanagan can emulate his game. Â

Cafu said: 'Lucas Leiva invited me to see Liverpool play and I was able to see Flanagan on the pitch. I was told that his style of play is reminiscent of my own, and he could be the next Cafu.

'He has a great future, he's a good player, plays for the English team. He's very strong, has a lot of will power, he has skills and this power plus his quickness may lead him to becoming a great full back - similar to the player I was.'

Flanagan played 25 times in all competitions for Liverpool last season. He missed out on a place in England's 23-man World Cup squad but was named on the stand-by list.
