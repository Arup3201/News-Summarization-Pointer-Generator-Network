A Utah family whose 18-year-old daughter almost died after she was hit by a car while longboarding have befriended the driver in an astonishing show of compassion.

Lexi Hansen was crossing the road on her longboard near Brigham Young University, where she is a freshman, on February 26 when Karson Pasker, also a BYU student, struck her with his car.

Doctors told her parents that she had the brain activity 'of a chair' and warned that she had less than a five per cent chance of survival - so they were stunned when she awoke from her coma.

Lexi, who also broke vertebrae, her neck and a leg, is now walking, talking and has returned home.

After the accident, Lexi's family's immediately thought about the driver. They tried to contact him, but only learned his identity when he wrote them a letter a few days after the accident.

Mrs Hansen called him to let him know that she knew mistakes happen - and to invite him for dinner.

He was nervous when he turned up dressed in a suit, offering the family cupcakes. But he has now developed a friendship with the family, who are Mormon.

'From our side, I've never had any bad 
feelings,' Lexi's mother Marcia told KSL. 'From the very beginning I just said, "you feel like you're one of my kids," and gave him a big hug.

Hurt: Lexi suffered a head injury and broke her neck, leg and vertebrae in the crash in February

Survivor: But she astonished doctors by waking from a coma and signing 'I love you' to her family. She is pictured with her mother Marcia, who called the driver and invited him to the family home for dinner

'The only thing I ever felt was 
sorry for him that he had to go through so much pain, and that we 
couldn't find him sooner to let him know our feelings because Iâ€™m sure 
that was a big part of why he felt so horrible - that he was worried 
about how we felt.'

He now visits the family at least once a week and is always sure to bring Mrs Hansen chocolates and a gift for her husband.

Lexi's mother said her daughter is still in a lot of pain but is improving - a miraculous recovery just weeks after the family were warned they should prepare for organ donation.

'Here she is. She's walking, talking and doing everything. So we know God did this,' Marcia said.

Pasker said he was touched by the kindness of the family.

'They've had a life-changing impact on me, to see their strength and their love,' Karson told KSL.

Before: She was riding her longboard across a road as she had headphones in when she was hit

Miracle: Lexi, pictured before the accident, is now walking and talking and is improving every day

Hansen, who regularly 
posts photos and videos of her longboarding feats to Facebook, was 
riding on University Avenue near the BYU campus on Wednesday 26 February
 when she was hit.

After
 the accident, a witness told Provo Police that the teenager had her 
earphones in and appeared to be trying to beat a car that was turning 
across the road at about 6.20pm.

But
 she was hit by the vehicle. Pasker immediately stopped and was not 
issued with a citation, in what police have called an unfortunate 
accident.

Hansen was not wearing a helmet at the time and sustained a head injury that put her in a coma for several days.

Support: Her large family, including her siblings (pictured), were singing hymns by her bed when she came out of her coma. Lexi (pictured third from right) then gave a hand signal for 'I love you', they said

Scene: She had her headphones in and was attempting to beat a car so that she could cross this intersection near BYU's campus - but the vehicle hit her and she suffered head injuries

'While we were singing, 
she hand signed, "I love you," moving her arm around so that everyone 
could see,' the family wrote on Facebook.

'She then reached for each person's hands individually so she 
could squeeze them. We could hardly sing due to the tears streaming down
 our face. We knew we were witnessing a miracle.'

The teenager is a
 communications major at BYU and wants to be a motivational speaker. 
Just ahead of the accident, she told her family that motivational 
speakers had all suffered hardship.

'She said to me, "You know, Mom, to be a 
motivational speaker, everybody has been in some big accident or 
something." Yesterday I reminded her of that,' her mother said.
