The rural hideaway where supermodel Kate Moss and her then-boyfriend Pete Doherty once stayed to escape from the paparazzi has gone on the market for £1.25m.

The remote Grade II-listed property in Powys, Mid Wales, was used by the Libertines star and his ex-girlfriend - who apparently 'loved it' there - before they split.

The 'magical' 19th century cottage, which the former couple visited in 2005, also doubles as a music studio where the likes of Manic Street Preachers and Mick Jones from The Clash have recorded.

The remote country cottage where supermodel Kate Moss and her 
then-boyfriend Pete Doherty went to hide from the paparazzi has gone on 
the market for £1.25m

The Grade II-listed property in Powys, Mid Wales, was used by the former celebrity couple in 2005, before they split

The pair stayed in the cosy cottage, pictured above, and were taken by 
the current owner to the local pub, where they were followed by 
photographers

Current owner Adele Nozedar said: 
'Pete and Kate came up here to get away from it all but the press kept 
being told where they were.

'We
 took them to a local pub and the landlord told us paparazzi were there 
and let us out through the back entrance. Pete was in a really delicate 
state at the time.

'But Kate
 was very funny and down-to-earth, she did the washing up, and was a 
really nice person to have around the place and she really loved it up 
here.'

The British supermodel and the singer were known at the time for having a tumultuous relationship, which began when they met at Moss's 31st birthday party.

Moss was said to be 'funny and down-to-earth' when she visited the 19th century property and she even lent a hand by doing the washing up

Current owner of the property Adele Nozedar said Moss 'loved it' up in the Welsh countryside

The pair, who became engaged in 2007 before breaking up, had a high-profile relationship and were often featured in the press.

Miss Nozedar said: 'Afterwards I dropped Kate 
off to get her train from Cardiff and I asked her if she was she worried
 she’d get recognised.

'She said she wasn’t, she’d just put on a hat, buy some cheap wine and read a stupid magazine.'

The secluded cottage was the perfect hideaway for the former celebrity couple, who had a high-profile relationship

The cottage doubles as a music studio, which the likes of Catatonia, 
Manic Street Preachers and Mick Jones from The Clash have all recorded 
their work

Aswell as being a celebrity hideaway, the semi-derelict property doubles as a music studio where Manic Street Preachers, Catatonia and The Clash’s guitarist - who worked there with Doherty - have recorded.

Miss Nozedar and her then-boyfriend built a 
recording studio called Twin Peaks next to the cottage - which sits on the banks of the Pentwyn reservoir - where several 
famous musicians have worked.

Miss Nozedar moved to the Ty Neuadd from London around 20 years ago and fell in love with the cottage while she was travelling through Wales.

The current owner says it is a beautiful part of the world and there is a 'special spirit' to the place

She is now moving after 
splitting up with her music producer partner Adam Fuest.

She said: 'This is an incredibly beautiful part of the world and a very special place to call home.

'It’s
 magical and has really got under my skin over the years - we’d like 
whoever buys it to maintain the special spirit of the place.'

The house used to be a water board HQ and 
the grounds include a 4,500sq ft filtration building which has planning
 permission to be converted.
