The cream of Hollywood will descend on Dolby Theater this Sunday for the biggest night of the year.

But amid the clink of champagne flutes, keen-eared stars may be able to hear the scuttling of cockroaches, a report claims.

According to TMZ, the bars of the Beverly Hills venue are crawling with bugs and flies. 

Photographs taken inside Dolby Theater where the Oscars will be held on Sunday show dead cockroaches (pictured), stains, mold and flies just days ahead of the ceremony, according to TMZ

The news comes just days before the upper echelons of Hollywood descend on Dolby for this year's Oscars

The walls, it is claimed, are steeped in mold and dirt.

And photos snapped inside show garbage strewn on the floor.

A video filmed last year shows flies hovering over a half-full cup before panning across to dirty floors.

Insiders who visited the site last week told TMZ conditions have not changed.

The venue was approved by health inspectors in June.

During the 2013 awards ceremony, the glitz of the evening was dented slightly when a toilet pipe burst. 

Images released showed servicemen in tuxedos scrambling to clean up the large pool of water that spilled out across the floor of one of the foyers.
