An armed gang who smashed their way into a supermarket tycoon’s country home and threatened his wife and daughter before stealing £220,000 worth of jewellery have been jailed.

Armed with a sledgehammer, a sword and a handgun in the early hours, three masked men broke into the gated property of Colin Graves, who founded the Costcutter chain of convenience stores.

His wife Sharon was woken by the trio in her bedroom and forced at gunpoint to lie on the landing while they opened the family’s safe.

Maidstone Crown Court was told by Judge Jeremy Carey that she is ‘a woman of commendable steel’ because she did not panic and avoided causing the incident to escalate into violence.

Mr Graves, 65, the executive chairman of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, was in Barbados.

The gang threatened Mrs Graves, 53, and her daughter Francesca, 16,  before fleeing the property in Edenbridge, Kent, which has tennis courts, stables and an indoor swimming pool.

Dominic Connolly, prosecuting, said: ‘It seems they knew where to look, they didn’t go to any other places. They seemed to be able to operate the rather complicated lighting system.’

Ringleader David Milner, 34, of Biggin Hill, Kent, was sentenced to ten years and Zak Price, 23, of Tonbridge, Kent, to eight years and three months. Jack Menzies, 22, of Eltham, South East London, was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years and getaway driver Aaron Wall, 22, of Sevenoaks, Kent, to four years and eight months.

Milner and Menzies were convicted by a jury last month, after  a nine-day trial, of possessing a  firearm with intent to commit  a robbery.

All four men had previously admitted robbery. Price and Wall had also previously entered guilty pleas to the firearms offence.

Wall, who is profoundly deaf, received a lesser sentence because he gave evidence against the other three, although he diluted some of the statements he gave to police.  Judge Carey said Wall would be at risk in prison because he would be regarded as a ‘grass’.

He told Milner: ‘As the ringleader, you attract the longest sentence.’ 

Fearsome: This is the handgun used by the gang to terrify Sharon Graves in her bedroom

The court had heard that Mrs Graves was ordered from her bed at gunpoint at 2am on March 19 by Price while Milner and Menzies stole the jewellery and watches from a safe. Wall was waiting nearby in a rented 4X4 Chevrolet Captiva.

When the trio left the house, Mrs Graves was instructed to lie face down and count to 30.

When she thought they had gone, she telephoned police. A patrol car racing to the scene passed the  getaway car travelling at high speed in the opposite direction.

Officers, acting on instinct, did a U-turn and followed the 4X4 to the Tonbridge area, where Price got out. Despite the risk of him being armed, officers chased on foot and caught him. The Chevrolet was found abandoned later that morning in Tonbridge.

It had been hired in Milner’s name and address. A search of the vehicle uncovered a sledgehammer receipt that matched a sledgehammer dropped as the gang fled across fields to the getaway car.

Wall was arrested three days later. Menzies handed himself in while  Milner went on the run for 20 days before also handing himself in.

Police said Milner had befriended the Graves’s housekeeper and abused the friendship to gain knowledge of the layout of the house.

The firearm was found two weeks later and identified as an imitation of a Sig Sauer handgun, which fired ball bearings.

Speaking after sentencing on Monday, Detective Constable Don Share, from Kent Police, said: ‘It is difficult to imagine the fear that the mother and her daughter felt during this crime and that has been reflected within the sentence.

‘Anyone who possesses a firearm should expect to go to prison for  a long time, even more so should they commit a violent robbery such as this.’

Police said a small amount of jewellery was recovered from pawnbrokers across South London, but the majority was never found.

Mr Graves set up Costcutter in 1986 after quitting as sales director of convenience store chain Spar.

He sold a 49 per cent stake in Costcutter, which has 1,700 stores, to Bibby Line Group in 2007 and the remaining 51 per cent to the same company in 2011.
