Adel Taarabt may have talked his way into the QPR team after his clash with Harry Redknapp.

The Moroccan winger trained with the first team on Wednesday and is in contention to start Monday’s Barclays Premier League fixture with Aston Villa.

Taarabt was left out of the squad for the 3-2 home defeat by Liverpool last Sunday and was later criticised by Redknapp over his conditioning.

The QPR chief claimed Taarabt is ‘three stone overweight’ in an amazing attack. The player ignored Redknapp’s invitation to speak with him on Monday and then sat down with Sportsmail to refute the claims.

Taarabt, 25, claims he is fully fit after an ankle injury disrupted his pre-season schedule.

On Tuesday, QPR chairman Tony Fernandes stepped in to defuse the row and claimed the public spat was ‘an embarrassment’ to the club.

Fernandes, who apologised to Rangers fans for the row, decided against disciplinary action. He has since tried to broker a deal between the pair that could see Taarabt included in the squad for Monday’s game against Villa.
