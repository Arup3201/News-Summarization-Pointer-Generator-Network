After Middlesbrough’s sensational upset of his former club, you could have forgiven Adam Clayton for trying to swap shirts with one of his illustrious opponents. Sergio Aguero, maybe, or Vincent Kompany?

No chance. The 26-year-old midfielder, deemed surplus to requirements at the Etihad Stadium in 2010 after 12 years at City, had no interest in giving anyone his own memento of the big day.

‘I didn’t get a shirt,’ he explained after Patrick Bamford and Kike clinched a stunning victory for the well-drilled Championship promotion chasers.

‘I’m keeping my own after beating City on their own turf. I want my shirt.’

For many on Teesside this fully deserved victory was sweet. Bamford, on loan from City’s title rivals Chelsea, will have relished the opportunity to show he can succeed on the big stage while goalkeeper Tomas Mejias, who denied the home side from racing clear in the first half, had a point to prove after a shaky start to his career with the club.

But for Clayton, who grew up 10 minutes away from City’s old Maine Road stomping ground, it meant more than most.

He was sent packing without making a first-team appearance as cash from Abu Dhabi — and a host of star names — rolled in.

‘I was on the bench here a couple of times under Mark Hughes,’ he explained. ‘That was good considering the calibre of players they were bringing in. To come back here and win is a nice victory for us.’

Clayton, whose grandfather has been a City fan for 60 years, admitted his family was divided over the tie but added that he had made his father’s afternoon.

‘My mum’s side are City fans,’ he said. ‘My dad’s a United fan, though, so I’m sure he’ll have enjoyed the day.’

A former ballboy at the Etihad, Clayton said that only Joe Hart remained from his time at the club and that the England keeper, who was benched for the match, had congratulated him at the end. ‘I spoke to Joe and a few of the staff I know and they just said “Well done” — and to be fair I think we did play quite well.

‘It was nice to get a little pat on the back and to see the place again.’

Much had been made of City’s late arrival from their five-day mid-season jaunt to the desert homeland of their owners.

Some claimed that landing back in Manchester on Friday evening, hours before the fourth-round tie, illustrated a lack of respect for their opponents. Clayton, whose path to Middlesbrough included stops in Carlisle, Leeds and Huddersfield, was having none of that.

‘They are used to travelling around the world, Champions League games, tours, all that stuff so I don’t think that will have affected them too much,’ he said.

‘You could argue it’s not the best preparation, but I’m sure they did everything they could to make them comfortable.’

Despite his elation, and his boss Aitor Karanka’s close relationship with Manuel Pellegrini’s title rival Jose Mourinho, Clayton insisted he still wanted City to go on and pip the London club to the Premier League title. ‘I hope they go on to win it, although I can’t say that as Aitor likes Jose!’ he joked.

‘I don’t mind. But we’re in the next round so that’s what matters.’

A beaming Karanka had his family at the post-match press conference as he reflected on his finest moment in 14 months of management.

He had spent the afternoon frustrating opposite number Pellegrini — and that continued after the match when the Chilean had to wait for him to finish before facing the media himself.

It was one of those days.
