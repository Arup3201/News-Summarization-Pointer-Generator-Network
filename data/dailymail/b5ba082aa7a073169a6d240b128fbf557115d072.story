A man convicted of abducting, molesting and killing a 10-year-old boy has been prevented from changing his name to Manasseh-Invictus Auric Thutmose V after converting to Wiccanism.

Charles Jaynes, from Brockton, Massachusetts, had petitioned Plymouth Probate Court to change his name earlier this year claiming it was a 'Wiccan religious tennet.'

At a hearing in November he said the name was given to him by God when he chose to follow the Wiccan faith.

Petition: Charles Jaynes (left at his arraignment in 1997) was convicted of killing and molesting Jeffrey Curley (right). He has been denied permission to change his name to Manasseh-Invictus Auric Thutmose V

But a judge has ruled that Jaynes' petition for a
name change was 'inconsistent with public interests,' according to the Enterprise News.com of Brockton.

The decision also stated that due to 
Jaynes’ history of using aliases, concealing his identity and eluding 
criminal prosecution, giving him permission to change his name would jeapardize public safety, reports the Enterprise.

Jaynes, 37, is currently serving a life 
sentence for luring Jeffrey Curley into his car along with another man, 
Salvatore Sicari, with the promise of a new bike in 1997.

When the boy resisted their sexual advances, Jaynes smothered him with a gasoline-soaked rag, took his body back to his Manchester apartment and molested his remains with Sicari.

Plea: Jaynes' petition to change his name, which was filed in June, gave his reason for doing so as 'Wiccan Religious Tennet'

The youngster's body was found six days later in a cement-filled container wrapped with duct tape in a river in Maine.

On his name-change petition, filed in June, Jaynes listed his address as the Old Colony Correctional Center in Bridgewater and his occupation as inmate.

Wicca, also called Witchcraft or The Craft, is described as an underground religion based on natural innate powers by The Church of Wicca.

The Neo-Pagan religion was developed in England in the early 20th century and became popularised by a retired British civil servant named Gerald Gardner throughout the 1950s and 1960s.

Wicca adherents praise nature and nature's gods and goddesses.

They practice outside in parks, gardens or fields. They endeavour to achieve self-awakening through dancing, singing, chanting, and with the use of herbs and incense.

Despite some depictions, it has no connections with Satanism. The Wiccan pentacle, a five-pointed star inside a circle, is often confused with symbols of Satanism. In fact, the five points represent the elements of nature - earth, air, fire and water - and the spirit, within the eternal circle of life.

The victim's father, Robert Curley, told the Enterprise that he was 'relieved' his son's killer would not be granted a name 
change.

'That's very good news,' he said. 'I'll take any good news I can get this 
week.'

Jaynes and Sicari, then just 21, both blamed the other for the murder of James Curley.

Sicari, now 36, was found guilty of first-degree 
murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole in November 1998. 
He is serving his sentence in MCI-Norfolk.

Jaynes'
peculiar choice of name comes after his conversion to Wiccanism, also 
known as Witchcraft.

The Church of Wicca describes it as an underground religion based on natural innate 
powers.

The first part of the new name, Manasseh, means 'causing to forget' in Hebrew.

'Invictus' is invincible in Latin, while 'Auric' means something derived from gold.

Thutmose V has the least obvious definition of all the names; it means born of the god Thoth, who served as
a mediating power between good and evil in ancient Egypt.

It also could be a nod to Egyptian history, in which there were four Thutmoses who ruled as pharaoh over 
the 18th dynasty of Egypt. But Thutmose V never existed; the fifth prince with that name died before he could take over his 
father's power, and a younger brother assumed it instead.

Gruesome: Jaynes, pictured at his trial, kidnapped Jeffrey Curley with another man on the promise of a new bike. When he resisted their sexual advances, they smothered him and molested his remains

Conversion: Jaynes said the name change is for Wicca, a pagan religion which worships nature (file picture)

In December 1998, Jaynes was tried in East Brookfield instead of Cambridge - where Sicari had been tried - because of the publicity surrounding the case.

He was found guilty of second-degree murder and kidnapping and sentenced to life in prison at Bridgewater Correctional Facility with parole eligibility after 23 years.

In September 2009, he asked to leave prison to attend his father’s funeral in Brockton and was initially granted permission. Yet after public outcry, officials went back on their decision.

The high-profile case also prompted talk of restoring the death penalty in Massachusetts.
