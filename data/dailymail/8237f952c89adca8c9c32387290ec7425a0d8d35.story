A quick-thinking four-year-old boy has been hailed a ‘hero’ after saving his little sister from drowning when he found her floating in a 5ft deep garden pond.

Jamie Isherwood screamed for help when he found his two-year-old sister Amelia floating under the surface of the fish pond at their grandparent’s house in Atherton, Greater Manchester.

The youngsters’ mother Natalie Cope, 25, said the toddler wandered off while relatives enjoyed a barbecue in the front garden at the weekend.

She said: ‘We had locked the patio door but left the side gate unsecured when I took the dog for a walk with my mum and Amelia must have wandered into the back garden.

‘We had just arrived back when I heard Jamie screaming hysterically. I followed him and saw Amelia submerged and lying face-up.

‘I was screaming but pulled her out, bent her over and gave her a good whack on the back and she coughed. She had swallowed loads of water.’

Ms Cope’s father Gary and her sister-in-law Suzanne Churnside helped resuscitate the youngster and a neighbour with nursing experience took over until paramedics arrived.

She was taken to Royal Bolton Hospital, Greater Manchester. where she was placed in the high dependency unit and constantly monitored until she was declared well enough to return home on Monday afternoon.

Ms Cope, who broke her right index finger while rescuing her daughter, described her son as ‘a real hero’ for alerting the family to his sister’s plight.

She said: ‘He knew something wasn’t right. He was a real hero.

‘We call Jamie ‘miracle’ because he was born three months premature, spent four months in hospital and contracted meningitis at five months.

‘Now he calls himself “miracle hero” and I suppose I really do have two little miracles.

‘It just shows you have to have eyes in the back of your head when children are playing and this might serve as a warning.

‘Fortunately it didn’t end in tragedy.’
