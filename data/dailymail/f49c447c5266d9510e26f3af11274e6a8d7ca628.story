The memory of an inspirational anti-war campaigner, who camped outside the Houses of Parliament for ten years in protest, will feature in a musical production.

Brian Haw became a familiar face to MPs and a controversial hero to civil rights campaigners as he protested about sanctions against Iraq and wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan until he died in 2011.

His family has given their blessing for the Youth Music Theatre to create According to Brian Haw. His son Peter even worked with the group to bring his father’s story to life.

Life or Brian: A musical about anti-war campaigner Brian Haw, who camped outside the Houses of Parliament for ten years, is set to take the stage

Becoming a beacon for civil rights campaigners, Haw used a megaphone, posters with angry messages and horrific photos of war victims to attack government policies. Haw and his followers fought off all legal attempts to remove the camp from Parliament Square and was arrested on several occasions.

Mr Haw, one of the protester’s seven children, worked as an adviser for the production which will begin at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, west London on August 20.

The 31-year-old said that the family completely supported his father’s decision to carry out the protest but found it hard to handle his absence as they grew up in Redditch, Worcestershire without him.

He told The Times: ‘While I completely supported his decision to do what he was doing, it was heartbreaking for him to be away from us.’

Haw once told journalists that he had left his family to campaign for other families suffering in war zones.

He said: ‘I want to go back to my own
kids and look them in the face again, knowing that I’ve done all I can 
to try and save the children of Iraq and other countries who are dying 
because of my Government’s unjust, amoral, fear- and money-driven 
policies.’

Mr Haw said his 
father missed 70 family birthdays but that the family stood by him and 
their mother Kay, who divorced him a year into his protest.

Mr Haw said: ‘He wanted to hold the politicians to account. He wanted them to see him every time they came out.’

Haw died in 2011 from lung cancer after years of sleeping rough took its toll on his health.

Haw was the son of a soldier who was one of the first to enter the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp after it was liberated from the Nazis. 

Haw spent time in the merchant navy and worked as a carpenter, but his evangelical Christian faith drove him to seek out suffering. He visited Northern Ireland during the Troubles and travelled to the killing fields of Cambodia.

In April 2002 Westminster City Council began legal action to remove him under the Highways Act, but the case never came to court. The council later limited the hours he could use a megaphone to attack Government policies.

In 2005 the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act restricted the right to protest in designated areas within 1km of the Houses of Parliament but the High Court ruled that Haw could apply to the police for permission to continue his demonstration.

In 2006 police seized 90 per cent of Haw’s placards overnight on the grounds that he had breached these restrictions. However, a judge later found that there was no case to answer.

The Greater London Authority successfully got permission to evict Haw from the grass area at the centre of Parliament Square in 2011.

His protest was immortalised in January 2007 when former Turner Prize nominee Mark Wallinger recreated his camp at the Tate Britain gallery. He also won a Channel 4 News award for Most Inspiring Political Figure in 2007.

James Atherton and Sarah Nelson worked with Mr Haw to create the 120 minute musical.
