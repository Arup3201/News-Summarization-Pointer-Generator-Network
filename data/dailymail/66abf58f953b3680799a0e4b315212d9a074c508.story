It sounds like something from a Carry On film but a male artist from San Francisco has created a bra that can be undone simply by clapping.

The battery-powered design uses an electromagnet that controls a switch which opens the clasp of the bra when someone claps nearby.

Designer Randy Sarafan was inspired by the weird and wonderful hi-tech bras found in Syrian bazaars and has created a step-by-step guide on how to make your own.

An artist from San Francisco has created a bra that can be undone simply by clapping, pictured. The battery-powered design uses an electromagnet built into the bra's fabric, covered with a bow. This magnet controls a switch which opens the clasp of the bra when someone claps nearby

The design sounds like something from a Carry On film (Barbara Windsor is pictured after her bra pings off during an exercise routine in Carry On Camping)

Speaking on his Instructables post, Sarafan said: 'The first time I read about Syrian Lingerie I was quite moved.

'In the West, we often think of Arab cultures as sexually repressed societies, when - in fact - it turns out that they are clearly leaps and bounds ahead of us in advancements in lingerie technology.

'Henceforth, it became my mission to fast-forward lingerie technology in the West. 

'I figured the first step in this critical mission was to replicate some of the advancements made in Syria.

'The article of lingerie that resonated most with my inner sensibilities was the clap-off bra.

'I immediately resolved to make my own clap-off bra as a springboard into Western lingerie innovation.'

Other Syrian lingerie includes remote-controlled items and glow-in-the-dark bras and knickers.

Although
created as a novelty item, Sarafan's technology could be used by 
arthritis sufferers who find bra clasps difficult to use, as well as 
people with physical disabilities.

Although created as a novelty item, Sarafan's technology could be used by arthritis sufferers who find bra clasps difficult to use, as well as people with physical disabilities. Designer Randy Sarafan was inspired by the hi-tech bras found in Syrian bazaars and has created a step-by-step guide on how to make your own

The clap-off bra uses two circuit boards, an Arduino, a 28-pin socket, two 22pF capacitors, a 10uF capacitor, 1K, 10K and 100K resistors, a voltage regulator, nuts, bolts, a soldering iron and other items. 

Sarafan experimented with exploding clasps using nitrocellulose that would burn the thread holding the clasp away to remove the bra.

He also tried using a metal coil called a solenoid, but the metal got too hot and could potentially burn the wearer.

The full step-by-step guide, with pictures, are on Instructables. 

Cut the clasp off of the bra.

Carefully break open the casing for the relay to expose the electromagnet.

Put your relay into the center of a prototype circuit board and make cut marks around the outline of the relay.

Cut two prototype circuit boards to size.

One board should have a 1/4" trimmed off of each long end, such that you are a left with a long strip.

The other board should be cut to a small square using the markings you made in the outline of the relay.

Put together the circuit using the 28-pin socket in place of the ATMEGA168 chip.

Cut the ends off a USB cable to leave a section of cable roughly 6" to 8" long.

Cut a small bow-tie shaped section of fabric that will fold over the front of the bra - the part the clamp is attached to.

In the centre of this bow-tie cut a small opening and fasten a grommet.

Insert a bolt through the grommet from the back towards the front and fasten it with a nut.

Peel back the jacket of the USB cable to expose 4-coloured wires and attach these wires to the circuit board.

Download Sarafan's code from his Instructables site and upload it to the Arduino board.

Solder the wires to the circuit board.

Sew down the electromagnet board to the fabric in the front of the bra where the clasp is attached.

Sew the circuit board to the top of the back strap of the bra.

Sew elastic straps perpendicular to the bra strap at the top and bottom and slide the 9V battery under the straps.

Plug in the battery and put the bra on as per normal using the electromagnetic clasp.

Clap twice to remove it.

A variation of this clapping technology was used to develop the Clapper switch in the 1980s.

The Clapper is a sound-activated electrical switch, sold by San Francisco-based Joseph Enterprises.

The Smart Clapper can be used to control two electrical devices, based on if a person claps two or three times.

The Clapper Plus has a remote control function in addition to sound-based activation.

Customers have complained that the Clapper can sometimes be triggered by a dog's bark, knocking or clapping on television.
