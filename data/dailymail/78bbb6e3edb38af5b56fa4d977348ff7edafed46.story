The organisers behind this year's Nobel awards ceremony in Sweden were said to have been constrained by budget cuts as a result of the economic downturn.

But these pictures of a lavish banquet held in Stockholm last night - and attended by more than 1,200 glittering guests including members of the royal family and Nobel laureates - reveal little evidence of cost-cutting.

As women in elegant gowns and men in white tie and tails made their way over slippery snow and ice to the dinner in Stockholm City Hall last night, the Nobel Peace Prize was being awarded to the European Union at a separate ceremony in Oslo, Norway.

Nobel Prizes in literature and sciences are awarded at the annual ceremony in Sweden, while the Peace Prize is awarded by the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo.

Nobel literature winner Mo Yan was among the speakers at Sweden's most prestigious social event last night, although he chose to steer clear of human rights issues after refusing last week to publicly back a petition by fellow laureates to free jailed compatriot and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo.

'I am well aware that literature only has a minimal influence on political disputes or economic crises in the world,' the writer said in a translated speech that was prepared in advance and distributed to guests at the banquet.

Although organisers talked of unspecified reductions in the expenditure on a night which cost 20 million Swedish crowns - or more than £1.8million - last year, frugality was not a feature that stood out among the fine French wines, cuisine from top Swedish chefs and the trapeze artists who entertained diners between courses.

'There have been some cuts,' Nobel 
Foundation Executive Director Lars Heikensten told reporters ahead of 
the banquet, but he refused to give any details, adding: 'You will not notice 
them.'For
more than a century, the foundation has managed the roughly $450 
million capital that forms the base for the awards, donated in the will 
of dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel. But in recent years returns have 
suffered amid the global crisis.

'We
are in this forever and we should safeguard it (the prize),' said Mr
Heikensten, a former Swedish central bank chief known for reducing staff
during his tenure. 

The awards are now worth $1.2 million each, down from around $1.5 million in recent years.

Still,
Monday evening's festivities at Stockholm's City Hall - itself 
decorated with 11 kg of gold leaf - were never likely to be spartan.

Details
of a menu, which included Joseph Perrier Cuvée Royale Champagne and 
pheasant with chanterelle mushrooms, were only revealed minutes before 
the food was served.

Guests at the event touted as one of the world's 
biggest set dinners ate from some 7,000 pieces of porcelain using 10,000
items of silverware and drank from 5,400 glasses.

Guests danced to music including Abba hits played by a live band after the sumptuous meal.

The European Union was awarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony in Oslo last night - a win which raised a few eyebrows when it was announced back in October.

Attendees heard Nobel Committee President Thorbjoern Jagland praise the EU's role in transforming a European 'continent of war' into a 'continent of peace'.

However, the announcement of had caused surprise and controversy in the midst of one of the EU's worst crises and at a time of deep - albeit non-violent - rifts between major member states.

Prime Minister David Cameron stayed away from yesterday's event - one of six EU leaders who decided not to attend.

Instead, deputy Nick Clegg got his own day of peace, attending alone to represent the UK in the splendour of the Nobel Institute in Oslo.
