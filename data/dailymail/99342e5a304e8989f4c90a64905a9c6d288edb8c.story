A man who was driving his girlfriend home to Michigan from Arizona after she checked herself out of a mental health facility has said that the reason he kept driving for hours after he discovered she was dead in the passenger's seat was because 'I cared too much'.

Ray Tomlinson, 62, had gone to pick up his girlfriend, who was exactly half his age, home after she finished a stay in a mental health facility and he brought his 93-year-old wheelchair-bound mother along for the journey.

The girlfriend, who has not been identified by police as they try to contact her next of kin, had previously been homeless and had a history of drug abuse.

It is not clear why exactly she was she was being treated for mental health issues in Arizona, but The Detroit Free Press reports that she signed herself out of the facility on May 28 and left with Tomlinson and his mother.

She had several prescriptions filled before she left, including one for 30 OxyContin, and her older boyfriend did not suspect anything was wrong after they made a stop for gas in Flagstaff, Arizona where she used the restroom.

'We're guessing she might have overdosed,' Warren Police Commissioner Jere Green said.

Tomlinson and his elderly mother realized the woman had died as they passed through Oklahoma or Texas on Monday- just two of the states they passed through during their 1,700 mile journey.

'He says, "I’m not stopping. I’ll get a hold of them when I get to Michigan,"' Warren Police Detective Sgt. Stephen Mills told The Detroit Free Press.

After the stop in Flagstaff, someone at the mental health facility in Arizona called the woman's cellphone to check on her.

'It's a courtesy call,' Green said. 'He answers and said, "She can't talk. ... She's dead."'

The
 caller told Tomlinson to immediately contact police. He didn't and 
later told investigators he was afraid police would arrest them and 
seize his van.

The facility filed a missing persons report and police contacted Tomlinson, who met them Tuesday. 

'I was in total denial,' he said.

When officers arrived Tuesday at Tomlinson's son's home in Warren, just north of Detroit, Tomlinson was weeping on the curb and his mother was in her wheelchair in the back of the van.

The dead woman's corpse was in the front passenger seat wearing a seatbelt and sunglasses and Tomlinson told police he kept driving because based on Internet research he did on his phone, he thought he had 48 hours before he needed to take the woman to a morgue.

'She obviously had been dead for at least 24 hours in screeching heat,' Commissioner Green said.

Tomlinson has not been arrested and the case is under investigation.

Tomlinson gave police explanations for his actions, 'which made sense to him,' Green said. But 'was he committing a crime or was it stupidity?'

He said the woman was homeless when he first met her last year as she waited for her then boyfriend to be released from jail.

He said he fell for her and helped her to get back on her feet - but she returned to Arizona several times to seek help.

He said their relationship eventually blossomed into romance.

'I loved her very much,' Tomlinson said to The Detroit Free Press.

Tomlinson said he didn't take her directly to hospital because he was in denial she had died and didn't want her to be left in a morgue thousands of miles away.

'I just lost a very close friend,' Tomlinson told the paper.

When asked if he would have done things differently, he said, 'Yes.'

Authorities are awaiting toxicology results from an autopsy performed on the body of the 31-year-old woman who died.
