Striker Luis Suarez had been linked with both Real Madrid and Barcelona following his stunning season at Liverpool.

But has his four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup put the mockers on a possible £72million move during the summer?

Barcelona

Barcelona remain interested. Suarez is being touted as the new Hristo Stoichkov, who was prone to moments of madness but formed a vital part of the team that won their first European Cup in 1992.

Not all Barca fans are convinced. Many feel that with strikers Neymar and Lionel Messi currently tied for the World Cup Golden Boot, Barcelona don’t need to spend big on a new striker... when they need several new central defenders.

Much will depend on whether Barca can persuade Liverpool to reduce the price. Alexis Sanchez may be included in the deal, but everything hangs on Liverpool’s stance.

Real Madrid

Real Madrid president Florentino Perez had turned his attention to Monaco striker Radamel Falcao even before the World Cup.

Having won the European Cup, Real do not need to make another big statement. Falcao is a cheaper option than Suarez, while Perez’s favourite Karim Benzema is having a good World Cup.

The chances of signing a player banned until November look remote, at least without a huge reduction in Liverpool’s asking price. Perez always has an eye on what a player can earn the club from sponsorship.

So with Suarez’s sponsors ready to desert him, Perez’s preference for Falcao will have kicked in.
