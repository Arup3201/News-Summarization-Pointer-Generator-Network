With its explicit sex scenes featuring bondage, nudity and whips, you might think Fifty Shades Of Grey had all the fantasy action any viewer could wish for.

But there was one scene the producers drew the line at – featuring the film's main female character Anastasia Steele and 'sexual' jellyfish. The jellyfish were the bizarre idea of the film's British director Sam Taylor-Johnson.

She said: 'We went to this beautiful aquarium and there were these jellyfish. They're so sexual, jellyfish, when you look at them in tanks – just the way they move, the fluidity.

'So there was a scene when we go into Anastasia's world and her head, and we just had these jellyfish on the screen.'

She added: 'It was beautiful, very impressionistic. Everyone went, 'What the f*** are those jellyfish doing there?'

'So we had to take them out. I wasn't happy to let them go.'

Fifty Shades Of Grey, which stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia and Jamie Dornan as her sadistic lover Christian Grey, is one of the most eagerly awaited films of the year, and its trailer has already been viewed more than 45 million times on YouTube.

But Taylor-Johnson, 47, said that although the film is true to E L James's best-selling book, it may not be as explicit as people might be hoping for.

'The thing that was most difficult was how and where to pepper the sex, and to not make it feel like it was gratuitous,' she said.

'So it had to be a really strong part of the story, and I had to give characterisation to each sex scene, to make them different.

'I didn't want it to be graphically explicit, and I know that's going to be disappointing to some people.' Taylor-Johnson, who is married to British actor Aaron Johnson, 23, added in an interview with The Guardian newspaper: 'It's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality. So I don't think it goes into the realm of porn.'

She explained there were constraints on sexual content because she wanted the film to earn an 'R' rating in the US – meaning it can be viewed by mainstream audiences.

Taylor-Johnson, an artist who also directed the 2009 John Lennon bio-pic Nowhere Boy, said she had been initially nervous about taking on the project.

But she added: 'I sat down with Aaron and he said, 'Just do it.'
