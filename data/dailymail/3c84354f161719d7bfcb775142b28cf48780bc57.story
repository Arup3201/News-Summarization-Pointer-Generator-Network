Have a sweet tooth? Swizzels may just have the job of your dreams.

The company behind all nostalgic childhood treats, including Love Hearts, Refreshers and Drumsticks lollies have opened a vacancy for a sugar-lover to become sweet taster for a year.

Swizzels has said its winning candidate must have 'a sweet tooth, previous experience eating sweets, finely tuned taste buds, a passion for confectionery, the ability to act like a kid in a sweet shop when at work, an adventurous and creative mind'.

Sweet manufacturer Swizzels are looking for a lucky candidate to work alongside the development team to produce innovative sugary products

For those who have always wanted to go behind the scenes and live the Charlie And The Chocolate Factory dream, this is definitely the opportunity.

The winner will be privy to a VIP tour of the Swizzels factory in Derbyshire - this includes travel expenses and accommodation.

Responsibilities will include sampling an array of 'highly confidential sweet prototypes' and working alongside the development team in order to produce innovative new products that will hit the shelves all over the country.

Entrants must be of 16 years and over, and to be considered, hopefuls will have to post a video entry or write 500 words on why they are perfect for the role of chief sweet taster.

Even better for young sugar-fiends, the salary doesn't come in currency form, but instead, the advert states that 'the candidate will be awarded in sweets.'

Sarah-Louise Heslop, Marketing Manager at Swizzels, says: 'We know that adults love our products just as much as children so we’re looking for our biggest fan to join us at our factory and help us develop new additions to our range. 

'It takes months to develop new flavours and the successful applicant will be shown the whole process, learning the secrets of how we make our fabulous sweets. 

'It’s an important role and they’ll be helping develop new products that could be sold across the country. No experience is necessary – just a love of sweets.'

The closing date for applicants is 30 April.
