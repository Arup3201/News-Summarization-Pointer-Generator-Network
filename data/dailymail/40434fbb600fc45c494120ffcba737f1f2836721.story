Missing: Police are still looking for Amy Arrington, who is accused of faking her own drowning

A North Carolina woman believed to have drowned in the ocean on Saturday has been accused of faking her own death to avoid a court appearance.

Emergency services had been searching off North Myrtle Beach for Amy Arrington since the weekend after her husband, Paul, reported her missing.

But on Wednesday police said they believed Arrington had faked her death to avoid a Monday court hearing on charges of identity theft and fraud. 

Arrington, 42, has still not been found, but police on Wednesday said they do not believe she drowned.

Her husband is now facing charges of filing a false police report. 

According
 to a police report seen by CBS46, Paul Arrington made a missing person 
report at a lifeguard station on the beach at about 5pm.

He claimed
 that his wife had told him she was going to the water, and that he 
watched her walk in waist deep, the report states.

About 20 minutes later, the husband claimed, he realized he could no longer see his wife and reported her missing.

A land and sea search was launched for his wife, but it was called off late on Tuesday.

City
 spokesman Pat Dowling told The State police believe the couple 
conspired to fake Arrington's disappearance so she could avoid her court
 hearing.

'It has been determined that she and her
 husband, Paul David Arrington, conspired for her to disappear to avoid 
having to show up in court in North Carolina to answer to charges filed 
against her in that state,' police said.

Authorities have not said where they believe Arrington may be, but an arrest warrant has been issued for her.
