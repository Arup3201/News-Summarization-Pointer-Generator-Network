Four Christians in Iran will get 80 lashes each for drinking wine during a communion service and possessing a satellite antenna.

The charges come as a United Nations report criticised the Islamic republic for persecuting non-Muslims.

Behzad Taalipasand, Mehdi Reza Omidi (Youhan), Mehdi Dadkhah (Danial) and Amir Hatemi (Youhanna) were arrested during in a house church in December. Taalipasand and Omidi were detained during the Iranian government’s crackdown on house churches according to the Christian Solidarity Worldwide.

The men were sentenced 
on October 6 and given their verdict on October 20 with ten days to 
appeal the sentence after breaking the theocracy’s laws.

Mervyn
 Thomas, Chief Executive of Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW), said: 
‘The sentences handed down to these members of the Church of Iran 
effectively criminalise the Christian sacrament of sharing in the Lord’s
 Supper and constitute an unacceptable infringement on the right to 
practice faith freely and peaceably.

‘We
 urge the Iranian authorities to ensure that the nation’s legal 
practices and procedures do not contradict its international obligation 
under the International Convent on Civil and Political Rights to 
guarantee the full enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief by all of 
its religious communities.’

The death penalty is among the punishments for those who convert from Islam to Christianity. 

Ahmed
 Shaheed, UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, said that it is
 common practice for Christians to be punished for violating theocratic 
laws, despite promises from president Hasan Rouhani’s to scale back the 
harsh treatment.

In the UN report he wrote: ‘At least 
20 Christians were in custody in July 2013. In addition, violations of 
the rights of Christians, particularly those belonging to evangelical 
Protestant groups, many of whom are converts, who proselytize to and 
serve Iranian Christians of Muslim background, continue to be reported.’

In response to the report, the Iranian government criticised Dr Shaheed’s findings.

According to the country’s 
state-controlled Press TV, an official from the UN mission said Dr 
Shaheed ‘has not paid sufficient notice to Iran's legal system and 
Islamic culture and considers whatever he sees in the West as an 
international standard for the entire world’.

The
 Iranian government has cracked down on religious freedom in a bid to 
stop the increase of Christianity, seeing it as a threat to the 
country’s majority ultra-orthodox Shiite Islamic religion.

An estimated 370,000 Christians live in Iran according to the latest report from the US State Department.

The UN reported continued: ‘[Iran’s] 
authorities continue to compel licensed Protestant churches to restrict 
Persian-speaking and Muslim-born Iranians from participating in 
services, and raids and forced closures of house churches are ongoing.

‘More
 than 300 Christians have been arrested since 2010, and dozens of church
 leaders and active community members have reportedly been convicted of 
national security crimes in connection with church activities, such as 
organizing prayer groups, proselytizing and attending Christian seminars
 abroad.’

According to Foxnews.com,
 Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), chairman and founder of the Iran Dissident 
Awareness Program, said: ‘Despite the recent Iranian charm offensive, 
Dr. Shaheed's report reminds us of the true nature of the Iranian regime
 where the abuse of human rights continue.’
