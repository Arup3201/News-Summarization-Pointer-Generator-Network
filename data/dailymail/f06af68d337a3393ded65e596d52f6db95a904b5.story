Two prisoners managed to escape from a semi-open prison by using a tractor to scale the perimeter, it has been revealed.

Convicted robbers Shaine Tester, 25, and Sean Horsley, 45, are said to have fled the Category C&D HMP Blantyre House near Godhurst, Kent, by parking the vehicle against the metal fence before climbing the rest of the way. 

They were working in the grounds of the facility when they staged the elaborate escape and subsequently went on the run.

A short time after their escape they were arrested in connection with a robbery, detained for being unlawfully at large and are now back in custody.

Guards inside the prison were first alerted when the pair of convicted robbers did not attend a routine roll call. 

A source told The Daily Star: 'We've seen ladders used to escape but never a tractor.

'It is big enough so that when pushed against a fence it provides enough a platform to get out.'

An internal document seen by the paper read: 'They [the pair] had placed a tractor against the fence and then used metal fencing to reach the top.'

Blantyre House has room for 122 prisoners and normally accommodates offenders who are preparing for release after serving three years or more of their sentence. 

The escape follows a string of recent cases which have seen inmates abscond from open prisons. 

In the most high-profile case Michael Wheatley, known as the ‘Skullcracker’, carried out a raid on a building society while on the run from HMP Standford Hill in Kent in May. 

The pair of convicted robbers were said to have been working in the grounds of the semi-open prison on the outskirts of Godhurst, Kent, when they carried out their escape 

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'It is clear that open prisons and temporary licence are important tools in rehabilitating long-term offenders but they will not be used at the expense of public safety.'

'Absconds have reached record lows under this Government — falling by more than 80 per cent in the last 10 years — and more than 99 per cent of releases on temporary licence continue to pass without incident, but we have not been complacent and have made major changes to tighten the system.

'Following a comprehensive review we have tightened the eligibility for open prisons, introduced significant restrictions on who is granted temporary release and will be bringing in world-leading technology so we can monitor their whereabouts and help lower the numbers further.'
