Dr Tony Shaw drove the 76-year-old patient to hospital in his own car

A family doctor has told how he took a seriously ill patient to hospital himself because no ambulance was available.

Dr Tony Shaw drove 76-year-old Richard Moses to hospital in his own car after being told there would be a two-hour wait for paramedics to turn up.

And when the two men arrived at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, there was no sign of a porter so Dr Shaw found a wheelchair and pushed his patient to a ward.

Mr Moses had gone to Dr Shaw’s surgery in Darlington with what he thought was a virus. 

But his condition deteriorated as he waited for his appointment and staff diagnosed a heart condition which required the urgent fitting of a pacemaker.

Dr Shaw tried to arrange for Mr Moses to be admitted to his local hospital, Darlington Memorial, but was told that, as the request was being made out of hours, he would need to travel 20 miles to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.

Dr Shaw arranged for an ambulance car and was told it would arrive within an hour. 

When that deadline passed, he was warned that the system was under such pressure that it would be another two hours before a replacement vehicle could be found.

The GP was given the chance to upgrade the call to a blue-light emergency but that would have meant Mr Moses going to the Memorial Hospital.

Dr Shaw said: ‘I made the decision to take him to James Cook in my car and one of our nurse practitioners very kindly offered to come with me.

‘We took an oxygen cylinder, defibrillator and resuscitation equipment. I drove and the nurse sat with Mr Moses and monitored his condition. 

'When we reached James Cook we could not locate a porter so I found a wheelchair and pushed him to the ward.’

Mr Moses was fitted with a pacemaker and has made a full recovery.

Dr Shaw said yesterday that A&E departments were ‘overloaded and inundated’ because too many patients were being referred by call handlers working for the NHS 111 helpline. 

He added: ‘The default position of 111 is, ‘‘Go to A&E.’’ They err on the side of caution but that adds to the pressure.’

Mr Moses, from Darlington, has since been back to the surgery to thank Dr Shaw for his help. The retired maintenance supervisor said: ‘He’s a wonderful man and a fantastic doctor.’
