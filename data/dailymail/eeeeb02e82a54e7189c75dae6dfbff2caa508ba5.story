They could be the ultimate gadget for the post Christmas lull - glasses than can tell when you're about to nod off.

Japanese firm Jins says its Meme smart spectacles are able to determine levels of mental and physical tiredness by monitoring eye movements.

They can also keep an eye on health, and even improve posture as sensors check you the wearer is sitting.

The glasses use sensors in the arms and nose bridge to detect tiny changes in eye and body movements so you can monitor your body for better safety, wellness and health.

The glasses use bio-sensing technology to detect tiny changes in eye and body movements so you can monitor your body for better safety, wellness and health.

The sensors sit on the nose and near the ears of the user, measuring the electrical potential in eye movements. 

The voltage differences between the cornea and retina can be translated into data for parameters such as alertness, the firm says.

Three electrooculography  electrodes installed where the frame touches the face and six-axis sensors along the earpiece constantly capture information about the wearer.

The voltage differences between the cornea and retina can be translated into data for parameters such as alertness, the firm says.

'Recovery rates from tiredness in humans drop dramatically once a certain threshold is crossed. JINS MEME can detect and alert you to those levels before reaching that point, providing a new kind of management tool for preventing tiredness from accumulating and for improving work efficiency,' the firm says.

In plans to launch the glasses  for the first time in the U.S. at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas from January 6-9. 

'Developed following nearly five years of research with leading academics and doctors in Japan, sensors in JINS MEME capture information from your body to encourage better health, safety and wellness actions via the companion JINS MEME app for iOS and Android.' it says.

An app analyses data from the sensors to work out exactly how we are standing, sitting and how alert or tired the wearer is.

The firm is working with  doctors and researchers to explore additional features, such as measuring interest levels, providing biofeedback for focus-training exercises and possible diagnostic applications for cognitive and neurodegenerative diseases.

'Since launching JINS in 2001, we have encouraged people to change the way they view the world, to enrich their lives and unlock new experiences through eyewear,' said said CEO Hitoshi Tanaka. 

'With JINS MEME, we are changing the game for digital eyewear with a focus on both function and fashion.' 

The $199 glasses are available in three styles

The frames were designed by world renowned industrial designer Satoshi Wada of SWdesign, who is responsible for other groundbreaking designs including the Audi A6 and ISSEY MIYAKE W watch. 

 'JINS MEME measures how our eyes and body move,' said Dr. Ryuta Kawashima, Professor of Tohoku University's Institute of Development, Ageing and Cancer, who has worked closely with JINS in the development of the glasses.

'From these movements, we can gather a huge amount of biological information. And we're just starting to see the possibilities. We're excited to explore other different uses and applications for JINS MEME.'
