A video has emerged of disgraced PR guru Max Clifford mimicking a television news reporter outside the court where he was today convicted of a string of sex offences.

The bizarre footage - which was filmed outside Southwark Crown Court during the 71-year-old old publicist's trial - was posted yesterday on Sky News' official YouTube channel.

Earlier in the day Clifford was found guilty of a string of sex attacks against four women, and was told he could face prison for his crimes.

Despite the fact Clifford was on trial for 11 counts of indecent assault at the time, he appears to be making light of the situation by mocking the news report.

Although it is unclear exactly when the footage was shot, Sky News uploaded it to their YouTube channel with the accompanying caption: 'During his trial Max Clifford couldn’t resist the lure of the media'.

'The following clip wasn’t live or shown 
at the time although the celebrity publicist didn’t know that when he 
approached the camera,' the caption adds.

Yesterday Clifford was found guilty of a string of indecent assaults on teenage girls over a period of nearly 20 years.

The 71-year-old became the first person to be convicted under the high profile Operation Yewtree sex crime investigation at Southwark Crown Court.

He was found guilty of eight indecent assaults, cleared of two and the jury was unable to reach a verdict on one other.

He denied all the offences and continues to deny the outstanding charge, which the jury were unable to reach a decision on.

Convicted: Yesterday Clifford was found guilty of a string of indecent assaults on teenage girls

Clifford was arrested by detectives from Operation Yewtree in December 2012, and charged in April the following year.

The investigation, Scotland Yard's inquiry into historic allegations of sexual offences, was prompted after claims were made against the late DJ Jimmy Savile.

The verdicts followed the jury being told by the judge last Wednesday that a 9-1 majority would be acceptable if they could not reach unanimous verdicts on any of the 11 charges.
