Police said the alleged assault took place between 1.30am -2.30am while Strawn spent time with his newborn child.

Strawn works at the medical centre in an administrative position and does not perform medical tasks.

Hospital staff said the alleged assault took place while Strawn was alone in a private room with his child.

"The family was in a "Rooming In" room -- a private hospital room away from the NICU to spend some alone time together and bond," said a spokesman.
