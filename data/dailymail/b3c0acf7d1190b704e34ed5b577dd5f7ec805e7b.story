Crime: Karnesia Lloyd was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of her ex-boyfriend Raynard Pete after she ran over him

A man was forced to have his leg amputated  after his ex-girlfriend allegedly ran him over with a car.

Karnesia Lloyd, from St Petersburg, Florida, was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of her ex-boyfriend Raynard Pete whom she struck ‘because she was angry,’ according to police.

She was also charged with child abuse because she had her five-year-old daughter in the car with her at the time of the attack. 

Eyewitnesses said that Pete had just left church on Sunday afternoon when Lloyd boxed his truck in at the corner of 37th Avenue South and 6th Street South.

According to police, two men, Cauiau Smiley and Vinson Williams, got out of Lloyd's car and started beating Pete, who tried to run away.

Another eyewitness, Ursula Bryant was walking her dog and watched as Pete fought off Smiley and Williams until Lloyd drove her car right at him.

‘The young lady drove directly into him. She put her car in reverse and hit him again. It was almost as if she was parallel parking her vehicle...She didn't stop until his legs gave out,’ Bryant told Fox 13.

Pete's legs were pinned between the front of the car and some concrete steps along an abandoned house.

Romerus Sykora, a 10-year-old-boy who lives two doors away from Pete said he was jumping on the trampoline with his brother when he heard the commotion.

‘When we came out and saw the people running into the house, I looked over there and there was a man with blood all over the ground,’ Sykora said.

The alleged attackers - Lloyd, Smiley and Williams - sped off as neighbors rushed out to check on Pete. 

‘He didn't say anything. He just held his hand out to be held,’ Bryant said of the moment she tended to Pete.

Sykora's mom called 911 and paramedics arrived and rushed Pete to the hospital.

Doctors had to amputate his left leg, and pins, plates and rods are holding his right one together.

‘I don't know how he's going to handle it,’ his sister, Diedre Seltzer told Fox 13.

‘My concern is him. He needs a lot of care. He's in critical condition. They left him for dead.’

St. Petersburg Police eventually found Lloyd and the two men at Jordan Park.

They have all been arrested on attempted murder charges.

Lloyd has since admitted to police that he intentionally ran over Pete and did so ‘because she was angry.’

Pete’s family say that they do not know how they will tell him about his shocking injuries.

He is scheduled to have several more operations before he can be released from the hospital.

His family have started a donation fund to help pay for Pete's recovery and a prosthetic leg.
