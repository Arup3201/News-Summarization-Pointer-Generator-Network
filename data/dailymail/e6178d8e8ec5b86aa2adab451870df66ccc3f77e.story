Eric Dier knows England Under-21s team-mate Danny Ings will need close attention if Tottenham are to overcome Burnley in Wednesday's FA Cup third-round replay.

After last Monday's encounter at Turf Moor ended in a 1-1 draw, the sides will again do battle at White Hart Lane to decide who hosts Leicester in the fourth round.

Tottenham are favourites to progress but Dier is not taking the Clarets lightly, especially given the form of Young Lions team-mate Ings.

'Danny Ings is a massive threat and he's probably their most dangerous player,' Dier told Spurs' official website. 

'I've played with him for England Under-21s and I've seen at close quarters that he's a really good player.

'He's shown that he's very sharp, so we'll have to keep an eye on him.

'In terms of the game itself, Burnley made it difficult for us and their style of play was tough to play against last week but at White Hart Lane we fancy our chances, especially with our recent home form going in our favour.'

Ings vies with Queens Park Rangers' Richard Dunne for the ball during Burnley's 2-1 win on Saturday
