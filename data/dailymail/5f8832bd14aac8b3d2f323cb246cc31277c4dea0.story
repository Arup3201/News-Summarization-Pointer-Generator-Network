Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has revealed that he attempted to bring Juventus superstar Paul Pogba to the Emirates before he left Manchester United.

The 21-year-old was let go by Sir Alex Ferguson in the summer of 2012, and Wenger admitted that he tried to sign the midfielder before he joined Juventus.

Speaking on French television channel beIN SPORTS, Wenger said: 'As a footballer, he (Pogba) has everything. It is difficult to figure out what he doesn't have.

'Things happened very quickly. We were interested in him. We tried to get him to come here. But he very quickly signed for Juventus.

'He has the potential to win the Ballon d'Or.' 

Wenger also revealed that Lukas Podolski will not be sold, despite reports that the German striker is looking for a way out.

The Arsenal boss rubbished an article stating Podolski will leave for €5m in January, labelling it as 'totally made up'.

'He (Podolski) is not for sale,' Wenger said. 'I am the one who fixes the prices.

'He came back from the World Cup, he has had to recuperate a little behind everyone else. He plays in the position where I have the most players.'
