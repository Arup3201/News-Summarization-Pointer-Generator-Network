Changes: Supercop Bill Bratton, pictured running LA police, says he would love to run the Met as Downing Street is changing rules to allow foreigners to run British forces

American supercop Bill Bratton has revealed that he wants to be the first foreigner to run the Metropolitan Police.

Mr Bratton, who tackled gang crime and reformed policing in New York and Los Angeles, was courted by David Cameron to run Scotland Yard in 2011, but was blocked from applying because of concerns about appointing a foreigner to a post with national security responsibilities.

However, Home Secretary Theresa May intends to change the law to allow foreign candidates to apply for top policing jobs in Britain.

That will pave the way for a renewed interest in Mr Bratton, 65, who said that leading the Met is ‘the only job’ that interests him in the UK.

The move will unsettle Bernard Hogan-Howe, Met commissioner since September 2011, who has faced criticism over his handling of the ‘plebgate’ affair involving former chief whip Andrew Mitchell.

Mr Bratton, who was consulted by Mr Cameron over tackling gangs after the summer riots in 2011, was credited with halving the murder rate in New York  and cutting violent crime in Los Angeles.

He advocates a zero- tolerance approach to policing.

He said running the Met was a unique and internationally important post.

‘There are three Western police agencies that have great significance in international policing – London, New York and Los Angeles,’ he said.

‘I’ve had the privilege of leading the two police departments in the US that have that international impact and that is something that is part of my interest in the Met.’

A consultation period on Mrs May’s proposed police recruitment reforms will begin next week.

The proposals will also suggest allowing talented recruits to join police forces at inspector and superintendent level instead of having to work their way up from the rank of constable.

Fear: The London riots, which spread across the UK, shocked the nation and Bill Bratton's track-record in LA and New York is seen an ideal way to prevent a repeat

Bill Bratton was credited with cutting crime in both New York and Los Angeles - including halving the Big Apple's murder rate and violent crime in the City of Angels.

The 'supercop' is the only person to ever serve as chief executive of LAPD and NYPD and his international reputation was established when he re-engineered police departments in the 1990s.

He advocated a 'zero tolerance' approach to policing and believed all offences - however small - should be investigated.

Mr Bratton stood by the 'broken windows' philosophy which argues minor criminal damage impacts on morale in an area which can lead to an increase in crime.

Explaining it he said: 'Broken Windows is the theory first put forward by two academics in the 
early Eighties. By cracking down on minor quality-of-life crimes – such 
as graffiti or breaking windows – police can reduce serious crime as 
well.

'In a country that loves gardening (Britain), you fully appreciate the idea if you 
don’t weed a garden, that garden is going to be destroyed – the weeds 
are going to overrun it.'

From 1996 he worked in the private sector and formed his own private consulting company.

He is a U.S. Army Vietnam veteran and began his policing career in 1970 with the Boston Police Department rising to Superintendent of Police in just 10 years.

Mr Bratton was police chief in Boston, New York and Los 
Angeles and won acclaim for his zero-tolerance policy to beating crime.

The Prime Minister wanted him to replace Sir Paul 
Stephenson but instead brought in as an adviser on gangs after riots tore through Britain's major cities in the summer of 2011.

At the heart of Bratton's policing tactics are the use of injunctions, which restrict the movements of those accused 
of being in gangs or involved in organised crime.

He
also uses the 'broken windows' theory - where he demands every crime 
should be investigated, however small, as he believes it will also 
reduce more serious crimes too.

In using injunctions he widened their use so, for example, criminals could not congregate at certain times of day or in certain
areas and could not carry mobile phones if it was proved they are being 
used to further criminal activity. 

Gang injunctions are brought under civil law, as opposed to criminal 
law, allowing police to use a lower burden of proof to get one.

Much of his theory was adopted to create ASBOs in Britain, which did not go as far as his tactics and not enforced as strictly. They were then scrapped last year as they were considered too weak.

In a piece for the Mail during the riots Mr Bratton wrote: 'I know about gangs. I understand the way they operate, the fear they 
generate and the urgent need for the Government to tackle them head on. 

'In more than 30 years as the chief of police in three of America’s most 
troubled cities, New York, Los Angeles and Boston, I have learned 
lessons and come up with initiatives, many of which work and some of 
which may be applied to your situation.'

Theresa May will next week open the door to foreign stars like Bratton, after she was the person who blocked his appointment around 18 months ago.

Ms May was said to have had no problem with Mr Bratton personally, but was uncomfortable with the idea of ending the tradition of British citizens heading British police forces. However, there has been a sea-change

Top officers from Canada, Australia and New Zealand will also be invited to take over forces across England and Wales.

Ministers also want direct entry into the police at superintendent level for ‘exceptional’ people from the forces, the security services, industry and the professions.

Currently, all police must enter at constable rank, but Mrs May hopes that allowing new recruits to skip the compulsory two years on the beat will attract talent.

Up to 80 of the brightest graduates will be recruited at inspectors level and groomed to become chief constables.

But Derek Barnett, president of the Police Superintendents’ Association, said: ‘We don’t accept the premise that there is a shortage of talent in the police service.’
