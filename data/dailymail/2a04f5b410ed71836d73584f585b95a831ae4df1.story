One person has died and six others have been injured after a gas pipe exploded in a housing complex in Ewing, New Jersey.

Earlier in the day, all seven were listed as injured- two of whom were facing traumatic injuries. The identity of the fatality has not been released and no updates have been given about the other injured parties.

The number of injuries continued to rise after the explosion happened at around 12.50pm on Tuesday and the seven injured people were taken to various outposts of Capital Regional Medical Center.

Raging: Seven people were injured and one of those injuries proved fatal after a gas pipe exploded at a housing complex in Ewing, New Jersey shortly before 1pm on Tuesday

Scary: The smoke from the explosion could be seen for 24 miles because the gas line was feeding into the fire

Ewing Township Police Lt. Ron Lunetta 
announced that five of the injured individuals are public service 
workers and the other two work for a contracting company hired to deal 
with the PSE&G gas line.

'Henkels
 and McCloy, a private contractor that does work for public service all 
the time, was digging in that area,' Lt Lunetta told NBC 10.

He said that earlier in the day, they had called in a report that they had 'struck something'.

'We're not sure how it happened. It's a pretty horrific scene down there,' Lt Lunetta said.

What remains: The six injured people and one fatality were a mix of public service workers and contractors who were all trying to fix the gas line in the condo complex at the time

Small victory: The massive blaze did not claim any immediate lives and only two of the seven injuries were deemed traumatic while the others were downgraded. No residents were said to be injured

Bizarre sight: Insulation filled the trees surrounding the blast site

The utilities workers were trying to fix a gas line when the explosion occurred at the development in Ewing, outside Trenton.

NBC 10 reports that the flames could be seen as far as 24 miles away.

Flames can be seen shooting up from the ground, apparently fed by a gas line.

Television footage shows widely scattered debris with insulation that landed in nearby trees.

The
 blast caused the area to shake and, given the development's proximity 
to Newark International Airport, some thought that there had been a 
plane crash.

Inferno: Flames and smoke shoot up after an explosion at a townhouse complex in Ewing, New Jersey. A gas line damaged by a contractor exploded 'like a bomb' while utility crews worked to repair it Tuesday at the complex, injuring at least seven people while several homes were destroyed or damaged

Debris: Firefighters worked through the rubble as the gas company still does not know the cause of the explosion

'I was out 
having my lunch in my car and it shook my car and I looked back at the 
building because I thought maybe a plane had hit it,' local worker 
Carolyn Gavila told NBC 10.

'Then I watched the windows as they shook. I just sat there and I looked all around and it was quiet.'

Annette
 Hicks, a spokeswoman for PSE&G utility, says the company is 
investigating at the site of the explosion and couldn't comment yet on a
 possible cause or whether workers were injured.

A police dispatcher in Ewing says there is no immediate word on a cause.

The
 explosion took place half a mile away from Lore Elementary School and 
the students have been held inside by administrators until the area is 
deemed safe. There were no problems inside the school.

Investigation: A major fire and explosion killed one person and injured at least seven other people at a condo complex in Ewing Township, New Jersey

Authorities say just three of seven people hurt in the gas explosion will need to be admitted to a hospital, and a hospital official says none has life-threatening injuries
