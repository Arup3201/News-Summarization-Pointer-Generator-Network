Chris Evert has promised Serena Williams that she will take her out to dinner to celebrate passing her career total of 18 Grand Slam wins.

And she also believes she will witness Williams overtake Steffi Graf’s all-time mark of 22 majors.

‘I’m so happy she won 19, she deserves it and I think she will reach Steffi Graf’s record of 22,’ said Evert in the wake of the 33-year-old’s Australian Open final win over Maria Sharapova.

‘If she stays healthy and motivated she can win at least three or four more in the next few years. I think this will fire her up for the French Open.’

Williams has ‘only’ won Roland Garros twice, and given her age it is essential that she keeps on winning if she is to catch the great German.

Some are of the view that she has already proved herself the better player because Graf’s total was inflated by the tragic events in Hamburg in 1993 when Monica Seles was stabbed by a deranged fan.

Evert is among those who would assert that Seles was the better player at the time but the fact is we will never know what might have been without that gruesome intervention.

For now Williams is heading straight back on to the treadmill as she said after her victory on Saturday that she will be fulfilling her commitment to fly to Argentina where she is due to represent the USA in the Fed Cup.

The top players are making sure they are available for the team competition as it is a requirement to qualify for the Olympics next year.

You would expect Williams to pace herself more and try to peak for the Grand Slams this year, as she seeks to return to the form of 2013, when she won two of them. Her cause will be aided by the new three-week gap this year that comes between Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

Britain’s Katie Swan, the 15-year-old originally from Bristol who now lives in Kansas, struggled with a leg injury during the Australian Open girls’ final and was beaten 6-1, 6-4 by Slovakia’s Tereza Mihalikova.

Yorkshire’s Kyle Edmund, just turned 20, followed up the achievement of qualifying for the Australian Open by winning the Challenger event in Hong Kong. He defeated Japan’s Tatsuma Ito 6-1, 6-2 to win his first tournament at that level and is now likely to enter the world’s top 150 for the first time.
