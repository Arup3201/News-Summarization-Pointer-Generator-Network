The parents of a severely brain-damaged girl blew her £2.6million compensation on a lavish lifestyle, a court has heard.

Cathy Watson and her husband Robert Hills allegedly used the money to buy sports cars, jewellery, property and racking up huge credit card bills.

The couple allegedly pocketed £500,000 over an eight-year period that was set aside for Cathy’s daughter Samantha Svendsen, Doncaster Crown Court heard.

Payout: Cathy Watson, left, and Robert Hills, right, 'behaved as if they had won the lottery' after Cathy's daughter Samantha Svendsen received the payout, the court was told

The girl, who is now aged 29, was given a payout in December 1999 after the NHS admitted medical negligence leaving her with cerebral palsy.

Jurors were told Samantha's mother and stepfather behaved 'as though they had won the lottery'.

Watson, now 44, was given £270,000 to cover expenses she had already incurred and the rest of the £2.6million payout was given to the Court of Protection for the child's benefit.

Samatha's mother and Hills, now 49, were given a ‘generous’ £4,000 a month 
for household expenses to compensate them for not being able to work 
through providing full-time care.

Katherine Robinson, prosecuting, said that the couple bought a property in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, in February 2000 for £22,500 under a council right to buy scheme using part of the £270,000 paid to Watson for her own use.

They later claimed £213,000 to from the Court of Protection to buy three properties - including the one they had already purchased.

Miss Robinson said: 'The money was never used to buy that house because they already owned it.'

They subsequently sold the property for £74,000 and spent the cash.

The Court of Protection agreed in March 2004 to provide further money to buy a Florida villa, and £235,000 was released.

Hills admitted stealing £145,000 which was ‘simply spent’, said Miss Robinson.

The couple later started divorce proceedings and the Florida villa plan was cancelled.

Hills also admitted not returning £25,966 from part of the refund for Samantha Watson is accused of stealing her share of the refund, totalling £41,334.

Analysis of spending patterns revealed that, between 1999 and 2004, £200,000 was spent by the couple on cars, the court heard.

Almost £18,000 was spent on jewellery and from March 2000 to December 2001, more than £100,000 was spent on credit cards.

Miss Robinson added: 'They were behaving as though they had won the lottery.'

Watson, 44, of Scunthorpe, pleaded not guilty to four offences of theft and one of transferring criminal property.

Hills, of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, has already admitted four offences of theft.

The trial against Watson continues.
