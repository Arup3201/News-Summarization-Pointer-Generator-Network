The Democratic candidate for Governor in Maryland slammed his opponent on Monday, claiming that Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown was someone that 'had never managed anyone, never run anything,' and was not up to the task of handling 'a real job,' despite being a veteran of the Iraq war.

The comment, made by Doug Gansler, Maryland's Attorney General, was made on Monday morning in front of a crowd gathered for a Gubernatorial Candidate forum, and has since sparked outrage from veteran's activist group VoteVets, who have accused Gansler of making a 'horrible insult' to war veterans. The group is demanding an immediate apology from Gansler.

'I’m running against somebody who has never managed anybody, never run 
anything, his ads are about how he’s a lawyer in Iraq, and that’s all 
fine and good but this is a real job,' Gansler told the crowd in Rockville, Maryland.

VoteVets released a statement later in the day, demanding that Gansler apologize for his words.

'Doug Gansler needs to stop smearing those of us who served in Iraq as not having had a "real job."' said Jon Soltz, chairman of VoteVets.org and fellow Iraqi war vet.

'It’s a horrible insult to all those men and women who put their 
lives on the line, and especially those who died, in service to this 
country.'

In a press release, Soltz asserted that: 'This kind of slime ball politics is what turns people off to our 
democratic process, so Mr. Gansler is doing no favors for Maryland or 
our democratic electoral system by playing in the gutter like this.'

Gansler later sought to clarify his statements, saying that he has 'the utmost respect for veterans,' and asserting that his comments were in reference to his opponent's failed roll-out of Obamacare and his leadership skills, not his military service.

'The point I was trying to make,' said Gansler in his statement 'is that Anthony Brown's only attempt to 
lead as lieutenant governor was the unmitigated debacle of the health 
exchange website that denied Marylanders access to health care and cost 
taxpayers nearly $200 million.'

Lt. Gov. Brown, who is currently a Colonel with the United States Army Reserve, began serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2004, when he worked with the 353rd Civil Affairs Command as Senior Consultant to the Iraqi Ministry of Displacement and Migration.

Both Brown and current governor Martin O'Malley blame the vendors of the health exchange website for the problems with the state's exchange.

Brown and Gansler face off in Maryland's Democractic primaries on June 24.
