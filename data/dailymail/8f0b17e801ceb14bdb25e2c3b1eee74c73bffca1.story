Critique: Fertility expert Lord Robert Winston attacks Tories for allowing MP's promoting homeopathy on health committee

Leading scientist Robert Winston has mounted an outspoken attack on a Tory MP’s ‘lunatic’ support for homeopathy.

The celebrated fertility expert and Labour peer said that he ‘could not believe’ that Bosworth MP David Tredinnick was allowed to sit on the Commons Health Committee despite believing in the alternative therapy.

Homeopathy operates on the principle that like cures like.

Mr Tredinnick – who last year called on the Commons to congratulate a farmer for mixing homeopathic remedies with his flock’s feed – also believes that the moon influences the accident rate, and once charged the taxpayer more than £755 for special astrology software.

But in an interview with Total Politics magazine, Lord Winston said: ‘I cannot believe that David Tredinnick is on that committee.

'Let me say firmly: I think his views are lunatic.

‘He is absolutely able to stand for Parliament and to represent a constituency, but views which have no basis in fact... you know it wouldn’t be so different from having an errant racist on an immigration committee. It’s barmy.’

In the interview, Lord Winston also criticises what he describes as MPs’ ‘worrying lack of expertise in life’. 

Last night, Mr Tredinnick stood by his views. He said: ‘I have a lot of respect for Lord Winston as he has done a lot of good work over the years.

‘But some scientists refuse to accept the principles of homeopathy despite the fact that homeopath doctors have been regulated by an Act of Parliament since 1950.

‘I have used it and I know it works, and it is used across the world.’

Mr Tredinnick has previously defended his views by insisting: ‘I wasn’t sent to Parliament to say what everybody else is saying.’ The British Medical Association has, in the past, derided homeopathy as ‘witchcraft’ .

Tory MP Andrew Percy, who also serves on the health committee, rebuked Lord Winston for attacking Mr Tredinnick.

He said: ‘Whatever you might think about David’s views on alternative medicine, it’s not for an unelected Labour peer to tell someone who was elected by the voters what they should think.’

Mr Percy described Lord Winston’s language as ‘offensive’, adding: ‘There are a lot of people up and down the country who rely on alternative medicines whether it’s homeopathy or something else.’

It emerged earlier this year that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered a review in the medical effectiveness of homeopathy.

He asked the Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies to look at three studies, funded by the homeopathy industry, which found the controversial treatments could help fight disease.

But Labour said Mr Hunt should not have wasted NHS time and money on the issue.

Sources close to the Health Secretary denied he believed in the practice, while Dame Sally reportedly said none of the studies were robust.

A source close to Mr Hunt stressed that the Health Secretary ‘does not believe in homeopathy or support it, but some people want to use it and that’s up to them’.
