The Curry family never knew what killed Thomas in 1925 when the boy was only 17, but they buried his body in Pennsylvania in a cemetery plot with his great grandparents.

At least, they believed they did. When anthropologists dug up his coffin Tuesday they found no body, only wooden boards, reports CNN.

A team of University of South Florida anthropologists has worked to exhume and identify the bodies of students buried at Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, where 100 students died between 1900 and 1952.

As the school's campus was becoming a series of graveyards, Curry died 'under suspicious circumstances while escaping Dozier twenty-nine days after arriving,' according to court documents.

The coroner at the time told the family there was no known cause of death, though a ledger noted he was 'killed on RR Bridge Chattahoochee, Fla.' 

The cemetery where he was buried has a document simply saying he was 'killed by train.' 

Then in 2008 a death certificate was turned up at Dozier during a state investigation saying that Curry died of a crushed skull but the cause was 'unknown.'

That led  anthropologist Erin Kimmerle up to Old Cathedral Cemetery in Philadelphia, where she hoped to answer questions of one more student's death.

The casket they found had the same thumbscrews as coffins found on Dozier's campus, but when they opened it, all they found was wood. 'Layers of pieces of wood,' says Kimmerle. 'It was completely filled with wooden planks.'

Crosses: The campus at the school became a series of graveyards, as officials buried scores of boys who had died while attending, sending others like Curry home to families

Plots: The arrangement of graves on the grounds is at times orderly and other times haphazard, and Kimmerle believes more graves are yet to be discovered

Forensics: University students assisted in the digs, which are intended to find human remains and investigate if possible the causes of death

'Where is he?' said a shocked Pennsylvania state police corporal Thomas McAndrew at the graveside.

The Dozier school, which only closed in 2011, has been described as a veritable hell of violence and torture, with with one staff member describing 'boy hunting' to the Tampa Bay Times, where armed guards or convicts from the nearby prison known as 'dog boys' tracked down escapees.

Back at Dozier, surviving charges say they were lashed, and some alleged they were sexually abused and raped, though some former administrators have denied the abuse.

That is where Curry fled from just before he was found lying by the train tracks with a fatal head wound, and someone worked to ensure the body was not discovered.

'Something was shipped up from Florida, and it was buried, and someone believed it was Thomas Curry,' Kimmerle said later.

When the school sent the coffin to his grandmother back in 1925, no one apparently checked the contents inside before a Catholic ceremony was held and he was buried. 

Kimmerle has contacted relatives of Curry's, and one cousin, 61-year-old Eileen Witmier, who is the granddaughter of Curry's mom's sister, has provided DNA samples researchers hope match to use to identify Curry if his body is found.

'Their interest lies in justice being served,' said Cpl McAndrew.

Boys often escaped the school, only to be hunted down in what some former school staff called 'boy hunting,' though others have denied many of the abuse claims
