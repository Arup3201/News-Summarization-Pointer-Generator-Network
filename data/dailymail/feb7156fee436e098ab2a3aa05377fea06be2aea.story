Opening a door, driving a car, even yawning - they are all daily activities we take for granted.

But for one mother-of-five, any one of of those simple tasks means the risk of a very painful dislocation.

Jojo Meadows suffers from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) -  a rare  condition which causes her bones to dislocate up to  ten times a day.

Jojo Meadows (pictured) suffers from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) - a rare condition which causes her bones to dislocate up to ten times a day

The agonising condition has seen the 38-year-old to break or dislocate almost every bone in her body.

Even simple tasks are enough to force her bones to pop out of their sockets. But despite her bizarre illness, Jojo, from Hereford,  is determined not to the condition hold her back.

Jojo said: 'My bones pop out so often, that sometimes I don't even notice it.

'The worst one was when I dislocated my jaw so I could barely speak. My four-year-old son was shouting down the phone to 999 telling them that my mouth had fallen out.

'My kids were doing handstands and I decided to join in - before I even thought about what I was doing I broke both my wrists.

'I dislocate my bones daily so it's become a normality, but it's still very painful.

'I'd say I end up in the hospital around 100 times a year.'

The condition is a genetic one which means the collagen in Jojo's body is too weak to hold her limbs in place.

She first noticed the condition when she was just 12 years old after finding bruises on her skin.

Jojo said: 'I noticed the symptoms when I was still at school, but I didn't get a diagnosis for 24 years.

'Doctors were stumped until I had a hysterectomy in 2009, and a doctor referred me to a joints specialist.

'When they told me I had EDS I was relieved, finally I had an answer to why my body is the way it is.

'I'd never heard of the condition before but quickly researched it and found out about the condition very quickly, I now help doctors to understand the early signs of EDS.

'Since I was diagnosed I've had to be more careful, but equally I don't let anything get in my way.

'It could easily let the condition disable me and change my temperament but I'm not going to let it, I've got a life to live, beautiful children and a lot to be thankful for.

Now, Jojo continues to live with her condition, and takes each day as it comes.

She said: 'EDS affects my everyday life.

'Just last week I had to make three visits to the hospital, and I need extra help every day.

'I've visited the doctors so many times now that I'm a regular - they recognise me instantly.'

Despite Jojo's frail bones, she has been an avid skateboarder since her early teens - although she's no longer attempting adventurous tricks.

She said: 'I can't do any jumps now because all my bones would probably pop out.

'If I banged my head it could be pretty dangerous for me so I only have a slow roll around now.

'I used to go on motorbikes, but I ended up dislocating my arms when someone accelerated, so skateboarding is the best I can get.

'For me skateboarding is a way of not letting EDS get the better of me, it's showing that the condition won't defeat me and it's very liberating.'

She's now trying to raise awareness of the condition, which is infamously known for being difficult to diagnose.

Along with Consultant Rheumatologist Dr Ayman Askari she travels around hospitals in the Midlands teaching doctors to spot the early signs of EDS.

Dr. Askari said: 'It's a very rare condition so on the whole doctors don't think about it because it doesn't have any cure or medication to eradicate it.

'It's not like a sore throat that you can cure, it's a life-long condition that will forever be with you.

He still believes there is a lot more that could be done, hoping to gain access to genetic testing facilities and teams of physiotherapists to help with hypermobility issues.

Dr Askari added: 'The essential treatment for EDS comes through physiotherapy, additionally diagnosing the condition removes a lot of the anxiety patients suffer caused by worrying about their symptoms.'

Jojo is also campaigning for more support to be available for people with EDS, especially during pregnancy after she was left bedridden, only awake for a few hours a day.

She said: 'My 15 year old basically had to doing everything for me during my pregnancy. I couldn't walk.

'He had to feed me, carry me to the shower - it was horrendous.

'But now I want to move forward and look to help doctors provide support, I'm not here to criticise or condemn.

'I want to help however I can.'
