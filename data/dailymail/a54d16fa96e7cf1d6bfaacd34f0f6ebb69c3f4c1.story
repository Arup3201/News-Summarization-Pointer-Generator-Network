A toddler who was born after a 15-year-old boy got his 13-year-old sister pregnant is to be adopted, a High Court judge has ruled.

The two-year-old boy, who was born to the siblings in Northern Ireland in 2012, will be put up for adoption after Mr Justice O'Hara agreed to a freeing order.

Sitting in the High Court in Belfast, the judge ruled that the mother - who is now 16 - was incapable of giving consent for adoption herself.

The two-year-old boy, who was born to the siblings aged 15 and 13 in Northern Ireland in 2012, will be put up for adoption after Mr Justice O'Hara agreed to a freeing order during a hearing at the High Court in Belfast (above)

The girl's brother, who initially disputed that he was the father but was found to be so after a DNA test confirmed his paternity, was barely involved in the proceedings.

Mr Justice O'Hara's verdict came after he described the case as 'depressing' and 'hugely unsatisfactory'.

The hearing heard how both the mother and son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were taken into care after the birth but were sent to different foster homes.

The mother was already known to social services due to previous concerns about her own mother, step-father and siblings.

The judge said the mother, now 16, was incapable of giving consent for adoption herself (file picture)

'None of this is her fault – she is a victim of the way in which she was raised,' the judge said.

'It is hard to identify any positive life experience which she has enjoyed.'

A report from a psychiatrist revealed 'in grim detail how miserable her life has been'.

It stated: 'She is not in a position to fully understand the possible consequences of the various decisions which have to be made for herself and for the boy.'

The freeing order came after local authorities sought to have the boy adopted for his best interests.

In a judgement made public last week, Mr Justice O'Hara said: 'She is undoubtedly capable of making some decisions as is shown by some elements of the psychological assessment but not a decision which is of a magnitude and which has the consequences of the present one.

'It appears to me that this finding on her competence undermines the proposition that she can be properly regarded as unreasonably withholding her agreement to adoption.

'I am satisfied that the agreement of the mother to the making of an adoption order for the child should be dispensed with because she is incapable of giving her agreement.'
