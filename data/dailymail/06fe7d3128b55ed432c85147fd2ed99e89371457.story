Sean Sands, a former soldier and experienced kite surfer, got into difficulty in 20mph winds, losing control of his kite and died at Hunstanton Beach

A former soldier drowned after he got into difficulty in high winds while kitesurfing and was unable to control his kite.

Sean Sands, a father-of-three, died after he was dragged through the water off Hunstanton beach in Norfolk in 20mph and lost control, leaving him unable to trigger his emergency quick release system.

The 49-year-old BT engineer was eventually dragged onto the shore by fellow kite surfers who tried to revive him but they were unable to save him.  

Mr Sands was at the beach on Saturday, the warmest day of the year so far, when it was packed with families and watersports enthusiasts. 

The experienced kite surfer went out into the water but got into difficulty at about 3.30pm.

The former soldier was dragged through the water and lost control, meaning he was unable to trigger his quick release system to de-power the sail  or detach himself completely from the kite.

He was in the water about 45 minutes before fellow kite surfers were able to drag him to the shore.  

The East Anglian Air Ambulance dispatched a team to the beach and airlifted the patient to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, but he was pronounced dead.

Mr Sands, from Heacham, Norfolk, was a long-standing member of Hunstanton Sailing Club. 

A flag flew at half-mast outside the sailing club over the weekend and few kite surfers returned to the water yesterday. 

A spokesman for Hunstanton sailing club said: 'Fellow club members and kite surfers were immediately on the scene to try to help Sean and the RNLI were called straight away.

'Tragically, despite the best efforts of everyone including the RNLI, Coastguard and the air ambulance, Sean did not make it.'

The club paid tribute to Mr Sands, saying: 'Sean was a hugely popular character and someone who made everyone feel like they were a close friend.

'Hunstanton Sailing Club have lost a true brother, a friend to so many and one of life's genuinely effervescent characters.

'Our thoughts and condolences are with Sean's family at this terrible time.'

Fellow kite surfers managed to pull Mr Sands to the shore and the air ambulance was called but efforts to revive him failed and the experienced kite surfer was pronounced dead on Saturday 

Dozens of calls were made to the emergency services to help him, and Hunstanton RNLI Lifeboat was paged. 

Hunstanton lifeboat spokesman Geoff Needham said: 'He was very fit and an extremely experienced kite surfer who knew what he was doing.

'It is a possibility that there was an equipment failure, but that will have to be determined by an inquest.

'Everybody was working on him for quite a while, but their efforts were unsuccessful.

'Our thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the family and relatives. It is so tragic that a sporting activity should end so tragically.'

Trevor Wright posted on Facebook: 'RIP Sean , condolences to all the family and friends. We have used the sailing club a few times now and everyone I have meet have always been so nice and welcoming. Stay strong everyone. All the best, Trevor from Cambridgeshire Search and Rescue.'

Kite surfing has recently become recognised as a serious watersport. 

Kitesurfers are attached to a harness to balance their weight against the kite - but this is not attached to the board.

Kite surfing rigs have a 'chicken loop' safety system with a quick release handle. 

This can be pulled by the user to de-power their sail if they get into difficulties but does not completely detach them.

A secondary system allows the kite and its rigging to be detached completely from the user's harness.

In April 2013 a kite surfer was critically injured after he was launched 100ft and slammed into a building after his equipment was caught by a freak gust of wind in Poole.

And in 2010 a kite surfer in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in south west France died after he was dragged across a beach, hit at least three rooftops, and was then dropped 50ft to the ground.  

Mr Sands was also a member of the nearby King's Lynn Triathlon Club, which posted a statement on Facebook.

It read: 'I am sad to report that a fellow triathlete and good friend to many of our members had a tragic accident whilst out kite surfing yesterday.

'I would say on behalf of all our members that our thoughts are with Sean's family and friends.'

Kite surfer Greg Richardson said: 'He was a really happy chap, always smiling and a really nice bloke - we're all cut up and in shock.

'I've been kite surfing here for five years and they all look after one another, always. It's a close family and it's like one of ours is gone.'

Richard Evans, 46, from Norwich, who was out windsurfing on Saturday said there had been about 40 people out on the water spread over a big area.

He said: 'I was about two miles off shore when I saw the lifeboat come out. When I came back onto shore it was a bit subdued and I asked what had happened.'

Peter Mallam, 69, who has run Wash View Café on the promenade for 16 years, said Hunstanton had been busy with windsurfers and kite surfers on Saturday.

He said: 'It was absolutely manic. All the parking spaces along the promenade were taken by windsurfers and kite surfers. It was the busiest I've seen it for a long time.'

It is understood Mr Sands was a keen runner and triathlete.

A statement on the Kings Lynn Triathlon Club's Facebook page said: 'I am sad to report that a fellow triathlete and good friend to many of our members had a tragic accident whilst out kite surfing yesterday.

'I would say on behalf of all our members that our thoughts are with Sean's family and friends.'

The incident is being investigated by the 4,000-strong British Kitesports Association. 

Spokesman Peter Shaw told the Wisbech Standard: 'We always advise our members to obtain fully-qualified instruction,' he said. 'All modern kites come with multiple safety systems and we'd advise any rider to practise using these systems repeatedly.

'There is an inherent element of risk to this sport. You're never going to remove that risk because that's why people do this sport. It's that edge which makes kite surfing so popular.'
