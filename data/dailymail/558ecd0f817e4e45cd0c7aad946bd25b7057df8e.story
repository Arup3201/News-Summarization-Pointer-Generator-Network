Steffon Armitage sent another reminder to the English selectors on Tuesday night when he was named Top 14 Player of the Year at the French ‘Oscars du rugby’.

The Toulon flanker, one of Europe’s standout players, has not played for England since 2010 because of the RFU’s policy of not selecting overseas-based players.

But Armitage, 28, has been one of the most consistent performers in the star-studded French league and said on Twitter: ‘Thank you everyone that came tonight #OscarMidiOlympique I am honoured to get it ..even tho the whole #rctteam deserved it!!thanks again’

The dynamic back-row is reported to be considering a move that would allow him to play for France, exploiting a loophole that lets players switch allegiances before the 2015 World Cup.

However, IRB chief executive Brett Gosper said on Tuesday that he is hoping to tighten the rules, which were intended to help smaller countries compete in the sevens competition at the 2016 Olympics.

‘There is a regulations committee that will look at all applications for transfer and they will look to see if it’s for bona fide Sevens reasons,’ said Gosper. ‘There is a safety net and any transfer will have to be passed by the committee. They will act according to the spirit of the law.

Banished: Armitage hasn't played for England since 2010 due to an RFU policy on overseas-based players

‘For example, if we have huge props applying for a career in sevens, then we’ll smell a rat. That’s an obvious example and there will be some cases that are in a grey area, but we want to ensure the integrity of the regulation and the spirit behind it is upheld.

‘Any obvious abuses that go counter to that spirit of why we’re doing this will be caught in the regulations committee net. But players will move in both codes by coming into the sevens game – that will happen.’
