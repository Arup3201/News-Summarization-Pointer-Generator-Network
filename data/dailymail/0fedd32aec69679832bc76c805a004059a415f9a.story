Aston Villa are in talks to sign free agent Joe Cole.

The 32-year-old had a medical at Villa on Monday evening and hopes to agree terms on a two-year deal and complete the move on Tuesday.

Manager Paul Lambert wants to add experience to his young squad and believes Cole's ability to retain possession could aid his side.

Free agent: Joe Cole was not given a new contract by West Ham and will now join Aston Villa

Interested: Paul Lambert thinks that the former England playmaker still has something to offer in the top flight

Cole, 32, was released by West Ham last month and has offers abroad, particularly in the MLS.

The former England international failed to make the impact he wanted back at West Ham but believed he was played out of position wide as opposed to his favoured central role.

But Lambert still feels Cole has a role to play in the Barclays Premier 
League and has made him his second signing of the summer following the arrival of Philippe Senderos.

Cole suffered from a string of injuries last season, including hamstring and groin problems.

He
had also been linked with a reunion with Harry Redknapp at 
newly-promoted Queens Park Rangers, while a move to Brighton had also 
been mooted.

The rise: Cole broke into the West Ham team as a teenager before winning trophies at Chelsea

The fall: Cole has struggled recently, having short spells at Liverpool (left) and Lille before his Hammers return

Still got it? Lambert believes that Cole still has some of the magic that saw him win 56 England caps
