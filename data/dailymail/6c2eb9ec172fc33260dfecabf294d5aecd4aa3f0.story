A teacher at an Iowa elementary school allegedly drank alcohol at school last week and had cans of beer stashed in her own classroom - prompting police to  arrest her.

Teacher: Kindergarten teacher Jennifer Rich resigned from her position after she allegedly drank alcohol at school

Kindergarten teacher Jennifer L. Rich was arrested Friday at East Elementary School in Ankeny, Iowa, the Ankeny Police Department said in a Monday news release.

'On Friday, Feb. 13, 2015, Ankeny police officers were called to East Elementary School, 710 SE 3rd St. at 2 p.m. on a report that a kindergarten teacher was observed with a can of beer in her classroom,' the release said. 

Authorities said that the 40-year-old West Des Moines resident took a preliminary breath test - and her result came back positive, leading to her arrest.

Rich has been charged with public intoxication and child endangerment.

The Ankeny Police Department also revealed that 'Police officers located a leather carry bag in her classroom with two empty cans of beer and four additional full cans of beer.'

Rich had bloodshot and watery eyes as she spoke to police, according to the release.

'The event was reported to police by a concerned parent who was in the school to assist with a Valentine's Day party,' the release said.

Ankeny police said that Rich is not being held in custody by authorities. 

WHO-TV reported that Rich resigned Monday, after she was placed on administrative leave Friday.

Ankeny Schools Chief Human Resources Officer Jenifer Owenson told the NBC affiliate 'After the teacher was brought to the police station and we were made aware of that, we put her on administrative leave.' 

Owenson told the television station 'We are not aware that any students were put in any kind of unsafe situation or that really students had questions at all.

'Our principal did take this weekend and call every parent at East to assure them that their student had been safe at all times.'

KCCI reported that Rich's resignation was accepted unanimously by the school board Monday night.

The television station quoted Principal Julianne Taylor as telling parents at the event 'We thoroughly investigate any report that raises a concern about the conduct of a staff member. Our students are our first priority.'

Per KCCI, Taylor also said at the meeting that a substitute has been found.

Authorities continue to investigate, according to the CBS affiliate.
