Police in Tennessee have renewed their search for college student Holly Bobo who has been missing for two years after a dog found what is believed to be her purse.

Bobo, a 20-year-old nursing student at the University of Tennessee at Martin, was last since in April 2012 by her brother, who reported seeing her being dragged into the woods by a man dressed in camouflage.

The first major break in the case was made Wednesday when a neighborhood dog brought the tattered and filthy pink bag to the back door of its owner's home near Darden, Decatur County - about a mile from Bobo's home.

Witnesses say the purse resembles the one Bobo had with her the day she went missing on April 13, 2011.

Officials with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation came out in full force Thursday in an effort to locate the place where the dog may have discovered the purse hoping to find additional clues, the station WSMV reported.  

Authorities are now scouring a rugged area near Bobo's home, which was the focus of a massive 2011 search involving hundreds of volunteers who combed 68 square miles and 57 miles of roads.

The new hunt for Bobo comes less than a week after her hometown marked a somber two-year anniversary since her disappearance with a walk and a run in her honor. 

Bobo went missing from her home in Darden, Tennessee on the morning of April 13, 2011. Her brother Clint, 25, told police he had seen her being led into the woods by an unknown man wearing hunting camouflage at around 7.30am.

He called authorities when he saw a small amount of blood in the family's carport where Bobo was believed to be abducted on her way to school.

Clint Bobo said he initially thought she was being taken into the woods by her boyfriend, but became alarmed when he saw the man's arm holding onto his sister and called 911.

John Mehr, spokesman for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, said in 2011 that officials believe Bobo followed her abductor into the woods without showing resistance because she was 'in fear of her life.'

The reward fund for information leading to Holly's safe return home has swelled to $250,000.

Investigators have claimed they have had 'significant' findings over the past two years, yet none have led to the discovery of Holly.

Her parents have previously said they thought it could have been someone who knew the family and their morning routine.
