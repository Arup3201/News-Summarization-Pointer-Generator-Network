A woman of 95 has died after waiting four hours in a queue of ambulances outside a hospital.

As Lilly Baxandall arrived at Glan Clwyd Hospital, North Wales, 11 ambulances were waiting to hand over patients.

And, by the time she was finally admitted to the Bodelwyddan hospital four hours later, her family said it was too late.

The former British Airways catering supervisor, who lived in a bungalow in Abergele, North Wales, developed pneumonia and died the following day.

It is the latest shocking death threatening to undermine patient faith in the Welsh Ambulance Service, which has met its response targets just once in the past two-and-a-half years.

Labour, which runs the health service in Wales under devolution, has cut health funding by more than 8 per cent since 2010.

And the cuts have seen longer waits for ambulances, far more people waiting more than four hours in A&E than in England, and poor cancer care.

At a pre-inquest hearing yesterday, Miss Baxandall's great-niece Kate Thomas, a locum doctor who helped care for her great-aunt in the ambulance, said: 'By the time she was admitted it was far too late.'

The court, sitting in Ruthin, North Wales, was told Miss Baxandall’s cleaner dialled 999 on September 1 last year when she found her on the floor after a fall. She had a cut on her head but was still conscious.

A paramedic arrived soon after but it was two more hours before an ambulance arrived, making it to the casualty department of Glan Clwyd Hospital by 5pm.

Coroner John Gittins said Miss Baxandall's case is particularly concerning as it is the third such case he has had to deal with

At that time, Coroner John Gittins said, there was evidence to suggest 11 ambulances were queuing outside waiting to discharge patients.

‘Over the course of the next few hours she began to decline and paramedics were becoming concerned at the delay in admission,’ the coroner said.

She was finally admitted at 9.50pm – almost seven hours after the paramedic first arrived.

A post-mortem examination found she died of pneumonia due to bleeding on the brain, caused by the head injury. The coroner said he would call a neurosurgeon to give evidence on whether Miss Baxandall would have had a better chance of survival had she been admitted sooner.

Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board, which runs Glan Clwyd Hospital, last week said it was struggling due to cuts to the Labour-run NHS – as it urged patients not to go to GPs for free prescriptions to treat minor ailments.

The coroner said he was concerned as Miss Baxandall’s death was the third he had dealt with recently where ambulance delays were a factor. He ordered bosses of the ambulance service and health board to give evidence at a full hearing, saying the ‘buck’ stopped with them.

‘I am particularly concerned because the issue of ambulance delays is very much on the public agenda,’ Mr Gittins said.

The coroner referred to Fred Pring, 74, and Clive Turner, 73, who both died in North Wales after ambulance delays.

An inquest into Miss Baxandall's death at Ruthin coroner's court (pictured) will try to establish why she was kept waiting for so long, and if she could have been saved if she was admitted sooner

Retired gardener Mr Pring died in March 2013 after paramedics took 42 minutes to respond. He suffered heart failure and died before an ambulance arrived.

In March 2014, retired engineer Mr Turner died after waiting five hours for an ambulance while suffering internal bleeding. He was then misdiagnosed at hospital and died the following day.

Mr Gittins had ordered the ambulance service to make urgent changes, but yesterday said he now wanted to see ‘whether things are changing’.

A spokesman for the Welsh Ambulance Service and Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board said they were co-operating with the coroner and ‘liaising closely’ with Miss Baxandall’s family.

In another case, a man waited almost an hour for an ambulance after severing a finger while mowing the lawn in Nefyn, North Wales. 

Owen Morgan, 70, lost his right index finger and severely damaged two others on Friday morning. Last night his family said the delay may have stopped medics from saving his finger.
