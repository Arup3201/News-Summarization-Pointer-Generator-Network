The gunman who killed a woman and injured five others during a drive-by-shooting rampage with an assault rifle has been identified by Texas police as a U.S. Marine.

Esteban J. Smith, 23, died in the resulting shootout with police early Sunday morning after he randomly fired on five vehicles from his truck as he ran amok through Concho County, Texas, according to Tom Vinger, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety.

Smith's rank and service record have not been made public, but he is an active duty marine and was stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.

Police also revealed that Smith is believed to be responsible for the death of another woman in North Carolina on Saturday.

For two hours on Sunday, the man - armed with an assault rifle, a handgun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition - opened fire on unsuspecting motorists from his pickup truck as he drove around the remote central Texas county.

Wounded: Concho County Sheriff Richard Doane was shot when the gunman opened fire on his patrol car. He was treated for non-life-threatening injuries

The Texas Department of Public Safety said Alicia Torres, 41, was shot dead in her car.

The Texas Rangers and other law enforcement authorities reported multiple shooting scenes in 
Concho County, a rural community with a population of 4,000 about 250 miles southwest of Dallas.

Authorities have not commented yet on a motive for the shootings, but they believe the gunman chose his targets at random.

The first shooting took place about 4.30am on Sunday when the suspect opened fire on vehicle near Eden, wounding a woman, who was later hospitalized in San Angelo, authorities said.

The suspect wounded two more people a short time later as they sat in their truck outside a convenience store in Brady, and then returned to Eden, where heed fired on another vehicle and wounded another person.

Rural: Concho County is in a remote area of west central Texas, about 250 miles from Dallas. The population is 4,000

Those three were treated and released.

About 6am, Torres was found shot to death in her car in Eola.

Some 15 minutes later, Concho County Sheriff Richard Doane encountered the suspect on a highway north of Eden. 

The man opened fire on the squad car, wounding the sheriff.

Doane was taken to a San Angelo hospital with non-life threatening injuries, authorities said.

Moments later, a Highway Patrol trooper and a game warden, who responded to the sheriff's calls for backup, arrived and engaged the gunman.

He was killed in the ensuing shootout.

Smith has also been linked to the shooting death of another woman, whose
body was found on Sunday at the Sunset Inn motel in Jacksonville, North Carolina.

There are more than 1,500 miles separating the two incidents.
