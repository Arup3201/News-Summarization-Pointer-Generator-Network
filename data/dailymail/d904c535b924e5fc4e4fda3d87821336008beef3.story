David Cameron has been forced to shrug off an attack by a Chinese newspaper that described the UK as ‘just an old European country’ only fit for tourists and students.

The Prime Minister said he would concentrate on the ‘facts and figures’ showing rapidly increasing Chinese investment in Britain, rather than the excoriating article in the Beijing-based Global Times.

The piece accused Mr Cameron of acting provocatively in meeting the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama last year, an encounter which plunged Sino-British relations into a deep freeze from which they are only now recovering.

It also took Mr Cameron to task for comments backing expanded democracy in former British colony Hong Kong.

The
 Global Times, which is owned by the official Communist Party People’s 
Daily newspaper, said: ‘The Cameron administration should acknowledge 
that the UK is not a big power in the eyes of the Chinese.’

The
 timing of the attack was particularly awkward, with Mr Cameron in the 
country and Downing Street basking in Chinese president Xi Jinping’s 
description of the ‘indispensable relationship’ between his country and 
the UK.

The editorial added: ‘We’ve discovered that Britain is easily replaceable in China’s European foreign policy.

‘Moreover,
 Britain is no longer any kind of “big country”, but merely a country of
 old Europe suitable for tourism and overseas study, with a few decent 
football teams.’ Its sneering conclusion said: ‘We wish Prime Minister 
Cameron and his delegation a pleasant visit to China.’

The
 newspaper appeared to backtrack later, apparently on the orders of the 
Chinese government, with a softer piece about the Prime Minister. It 
said: ‘China and the UK hold divergent views in terms of human rights, 
democracy and freedom because of different development phases, political
 systems and ideologies. But this should neither dominate bilateral ties
 nor overshadow the momentum for cooperation.’

The
 Prime Minister, who yesterday hosted a lunch attended by 600 business 
leaders and officials in Shanghai, said he was not concerned by the 
editorial.

Speaking on the 
second day of his visit to China, he said: ‘I would just prefer to go on
 the figures. This is a visit that has delivered almost £6billion worth 
of deals.

It is a visit that
 comes on the back of an 18-month period where we have seen more Chinese
 investment into Britain than in the previous thirty years.’

China's yuan currency overtook the euro in October becoming the second-most used currency in trade finance, global transaction services organisation SWIFT has said.

The market share of yuan usage in trade finance, or Letters of Credit and Collection, grew to 8.66 percent in October 2013. That improved from 1.89 percent in January 2012.

The yuan, also known as the renminbi, now ranks behind the U.S. dollar, which remains the leading currency with a share of 81.08 percent.

The top five countries using the yuan for trade finance in October were China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Germany and Australia, SWIFT said in a statement.

Franck de Praetere, SWIFT's Asia Pacific head of payments and trade markets said: 'The RMB is clearly a top currency for trade finance globally and even more so in Asia.'

The RMB remained the 12th payments currency of the world, with a slightly decreased share of 0.84 percent compared with 0.86 percent in September.

RMB payments increased in value by 1.5 percent in October, while growth for all payments currencies was at 4.6 percent.

The world's second-largest economy is accelerating the pace of financial reform to promote its currency to international players beyond Hong Kong.

China aims to lift the yuan's global clout and reduce its reliance on the U.S. dollar.

Yuan trade settlement has expanded quickly since it first began in 2009 and the percentage of China's total trade settled in yuan has risen from 12 per cent in 2012 to nearly 20 per cent.
