Monopoly, the world's favorite capitalist board game, was first invented by a left-wing campaigner as a protest against the unbridled thirst for profit, a new book claims.

Elizabeth Magie, the daughter of a progressive newspaper publisher from Illinois, filed a legal claim for her Landlord's Game in 1903, 30 years before Parker Brother began manufacturing Monopoly.

Her story disputes the origin myth sometimes distributed with the game, which claims Charles Darrow came up with Monopoly in the 1930s, saving himself and Parker Brothers from ruin.

The original: Elizabeth Magie alongside her original patent drawing for The Landlord's Game, the first precursor to Monopoly, which she designed to draw attention to the unfairness of U.S. economics

Mary Pilon, author of a new book about Monopoly's hidden history, writes in The New York Times that Magie came up with the game as a protest against America's property moguls.

These powerful businessmen, including such figures as John D Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, controlled much of the U.S. economy in the nineteenth century, when there were massive disparities of wealth between rich and poor.

Magie was inspired to create the game by the theories of Henry George, an economist and politician. He advocated for the institution of a single 'land-value tax' to shift the tax burden from the poor to the wealthy landlords.

Each person legitimately owns 100 per cent of the value they create, said George, but natural resources, common opportunities and, most importantly, the value of land, belongs equally to each person in a community.

Magie had learned of George's theories from her father, who once ran for office in Illinois on an anti-monopoly ticket, but it wasn't until she was 37 and living with friends in Maryland that she finally perfected her game.

She was granted U.S. Patent 748,626 for The Landlord's Game on January 5, 1904. In 1906, she moved to Chicago where she and fellow Georgists formed the Economic Game Co. to self-publish her invention.

Pilon wrote: 'She created two sets of rules for her game: an anti-monopolist set in which all were rewarded when wealth was created, and a monopolist set in which the goal was to create monopolies and crush opponents. 

'Her dualistic approach was a teaching tool meant to demonstrate that the first set of rules was morally superior.'

Pretender: Charles Darrow, left, earned millions after he took the essence of Magie's game and sold a modified version to Parker Brothers. Right is a recent issue of the UK version of the board game

Despite a lack of major financial backing, Magie's game quickly spread among left-wing intellectuals, particularly in the Northeast, Pilon wrote. College students also took it up, many of them apparently making their own boards according to the rules Magie laid out.

But it was after it spread to a Quaker community in Atlantic City, New Jersey, that Magie began to lose control of her invention. It was this version, which included various modifications including the Atlantic City neighborhoods on Parker Brothers' first issues of the game, that was picked up by Charles Darrow.

Darrow pitched his version of the game to Parker Brothers, who snapped it up. The company then struck a deal with Magie to buy out her Landlord's Game patent, as well as two more of her game ideas.

As the game grew in popularity, Magie was gradually pushed aside, despite her public protestations. Eventually, even after newspaper reports in which she presented original game boards to prove she was the game's true creator, her progressive set of rules was dispensed with. Darrow became a millionaire.

By the 1970s, the false notion that the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become more than popular folklore: it was printed in the game's instructions. Even now, a potted history of Monopoly on the website of Hasbro, the toy giant that currently owns the rights, makes no mention of its history prior to 1935. 

Despite the eclipse of her socially progressive take on the Monopoly board game, it seems that Magie anticipated one of the game's most-notorious effects - family rows over the unfair behavior of players to opponents who find themselves in hard times.

In a commentary on The Landlord's Game given to the Single Tax Review in 1902, she wrote: 'There are those who argue that it may be a dangerous thing to teach children how they may thus get the advantage of their fellows, but let me tell you there are no fairer-minded beings in the world than our own little American children.

'Watch them in their play and see how quick they are, should any one of their number attempt to cheat or take undue advantage of another, to cry, "No fair!" And who has not heard almost every little girl say, "I won't play if you don't play fair."

'Let the children once see clearly the gross injustice of our present land system and when they grow up, if they are allowed to develop naturally, the evil will soon be remedied.' 

Magie's role in the genesis of Monopoly was uncovered by a economics professor during a long legal battle against Parker Brothers. Ralph Anspach found Magie's patents after the company tried to stop him producing his own Anti-Monopoly game in 1973. 

They entered court record and helped him finally win a Supreme Court case against Parker Brothers.

But it was too late for Magie, who died in relative obscurity in 1948, a widow without children, having made just $500 from her idea.
