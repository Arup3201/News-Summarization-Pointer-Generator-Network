A man has developed a rare condition that causes him to experience orgasmic sensations when he hears James Bond theme music.

It is only the second known case of a patient developing synesthesia after a stroke.

The neurological condition causes the stimulation of a sense, such as hearing music, to lead to automatic, involuntary experiences in a different sense, such as seeing colours or tasting a flavour.

A stroke patient has developed synesthesia, a neurological condition that causes the brain to confuse senses, several months after a stroke. When listening to high-pitched voices or brass instruments - often when listening to James Bond themes -  he would experience 'orgasmic sensations'

After a stroke in 2007, the unnamed 45-year-old man from Toronto noticed that words printed in a particular shade of blue disgusted him, according to a report by National Post.

He then became aware that the sound of high-pitched voices and brass instruments — specifically, the theme music from James Bond films — triggered out-of-body, orgasmic sensations and blue flashes of light in his vision.

He said he felt as if ‘he could ride the music’.

The Toronto St. Michael’s Hospital patient specifically recalled a moment when he watched the Beijing Olympics.

Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight.

Another form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters, shapes, numbers or people's names with a sensory perception such as smell, colour or flavour.

Around four per cent of people are thought to have the condition which is eight times more common in women.

Most synesthesists tend to be left-handed.

There are no dangerous side-effects to the having the condition

Famous synesthesists include Marilyn Monroe, Mary J Blige as well as the artists Kandinsky and Hockney.

He said when a woman sang at the opening ceremony it triggered an overwhelming and frightening reaction.

He said: ‘I had the sensation of entering the TV, and entering the stadium and I was floating above the crowd. I could feel the heat and humidity coming off the people. I could feel it on my skin.

‘It scared the hell out of me. I thought, "this is how you lose your mind". I was convinced I was going to go crazy.’

He was eventually referred to his Dr Luis Fornazarri, a behavioural neurologist, who instantly diagnosed him with synaesthesia.

Feeling blue: The man first became concerned because he became addicted to raspberries after he said they tasted of a certain shade of blue. However seeing sky blue suddenly left him feeling disgusted

Other symptoms exhibited by the man include an insatiable hunger for raspberries because they taste of a 'certain shade of blue'.

The patient's stroke occurred in his thalamus -  the area of the brain responsible for processing sensory information.

Experts
 say the process of repair after the stroke caused the brain to 
'miswire', connecting areas of the brain that once never came into 
contact with each other.

The only other reported case of synesthesia following a stroke is a 35-year-old U.S. woman who experienced tingling in her body when she heard certain sounds.

Since the male patient's diagnosis, he has learned to control his synesthesia, saying that having a diagnosis has reassured him that his 'weird feelings' aren't a sign of madness but just a side-effect of his stroke.
