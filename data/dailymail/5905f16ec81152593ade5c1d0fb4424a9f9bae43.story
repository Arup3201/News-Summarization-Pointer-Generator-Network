A French Jew who was wrongly executed for blood libel almost 350 years ago has been exonerated of the crime and declared a martyr.

Raphael Levy was burned at the stake in 1670 after being accused of killing a three-year-old Christian and using their blood for religious rituals.

But on Sunday, more than three decades after his death, officials in Glatigny, Moselle, dedicated a plaque to the man's memory, describing him as a 'martyr accused of a crime he did not commit.'

The ceremony in France was attended by more than 100 people, including the president of the Consistoire – the French Jewish community’s organization responsible for religious services, the Times of Israel reports.

Speaking at the event, the mayor of Glatigny, Victor Stallone said: 'Today we are back to square one, we are reconciled, we resume normal relations with the Jewish community.

'Glatigny was cursed since that time because of a principled prohibition decided upon by the Jewish community.'

The village was considered cursed after the incident in 1670, with Jewish travellers prohibited from spending the night there in its wake. 

Blood libel allegations originate in the Middle Ages when Jews were falsely accused of murdering children for ritual purposes. 

They were largely spread to justify violence against Jews, and often used to explain mysterious deaths of children.

The first known accusation of blood libel was in England in the 12th century, when a child called William of Norwich was found dead with what looked like horn piercings in his head.

Centuries later, the Nazis often spread propaganda alleging ritual murder at the hands of Jews to justify their violent behaviour towards them.
