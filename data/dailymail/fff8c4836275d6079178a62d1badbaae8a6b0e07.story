Newcastle United will not be re-signing Loic Remy this summer.

The Queens Park Rangers striker spent last season on loan at St James’ Park, where he top scored with 14 goals.

Manager Alan Pardew and the club’s hierarchy made it clear to Remy and his representatives they wanted to sign him on a permanent deal, but the player had Champions League aspirations.

Uncertain future: Remy is in limbo after his proposed £8.5m move to Liverpool collapsed

He subsequently agreed terms with Liverpool and was on the verge of an £8.5million move only for the deal to collapse when the 27-year-old failed a medical.

That triggered talk of a return to Tyneside but Pardew has confirmed that United have moved on from their pursuit of the France international, and will instead bring in Shakhtar Donetsk’s 23-year-old forward Ferreyra Facundo on a season-long loan deal.

On the subject of Remy, the United boss told BBC Newcastle: ‘I think he’s had plenty of chances to come to us.

‘We made it very clear that we would like to have him and it hasn’t really happened and therefore sometimes you have to say where’s the line drawn for us as a club as we have our own respect and our own professionalism.

Moving on: Alan Pardew will sign Ferreyra Facundo from Shakhtar Donestk instead of Loic Remy

‘So maybe that one has gone away but like all transfers they’re never, ever over so we’ll keep our finger on the pulse.’

Newcastle, meanwhile, face Malaga in the Schalke 04 Cup on Saturday afternoon where they will be without summer signing Siem de Jong who has a calf injury.

Dutch internationals Tim Krul and Daryl Janmaat have travelled with the squad to Gelsenkirchen but will not feature.
