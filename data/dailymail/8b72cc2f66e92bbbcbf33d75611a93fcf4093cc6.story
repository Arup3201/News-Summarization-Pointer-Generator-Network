Wimbledon runner-up Sabine Lisicki, 23, has split from her Olympic rower boyfriend

German Wimbledon loser Sabine Lisicki has suffered a double blow - her 18 month affair with an Olympic swimmer is over. 

Sabine, 23, who is known in Germany as 'Doris Becker' in homage to her own talents and Wimbledon legend Boris Becker, lost in straight sets in the women's final on Saturday to Marion Bartoli of France.

Her boyfriend Benjamin Starke was not there to witness it - he stayed at home in Berlin telling friends he did not want to become involved in the 'Wimbledon circus.'

Now Sabine has told a TV interviewer: 'I don't like to talk about my private life. But I can only say that it no longer exists at the moment.' 

It is unclear exactly when the split occurred.

Sabine, who wept on the centre court as she was trounced in the final, is not shedding any tears over the break-up with Starke.

Their love-affair began in December 2011 when both were hit by injuries and spent weeks together in a rehab centre in Germany. But they were seldom seen together in public. 

Even when they both attended an ice-hockey match they sat apart to avoid the media's attention.

Lisicki did most of her training in Florida while her boy-friend spent most of his time in Berlin - too far apart, said pals, for the love affair to work.

Now Sabine, currently No 18 in the world ratings, wants to concentrate only on her tennis. 'I want to be the world's Number one,' she told the TV interviewer.

The German swimming star and the tennis wunderkind have been an item since last year but are intensely private.  No photos of them smooching in public, dining or dancing have ever been taken.

She used to stay with him in his 
apartment in the Mitte district of Berlin when over from Florida.  When 
they were an item they liked watching the Berlin ice hockey team Polar 
Bears at home games.

He 
competed at the Olympic Games in London last year and she was there to 
cheer him on, but despite winning a silver and a bronze at Rome and 
Shanghai in recent years, he didn't bag any medals.

Couple: Olympic swimmer Benjamin Starke and Sabine Lisicki had been an item since 2011 but they were rarely pictured together

Known as a 'funster' and a 'live wire', Sabine has suffered many injuries in recent years that has held her career back. 

She began playing as a teenager in her
home town of Troisdorf, near Bonn, when she was seven and moved when 
she was 10 to Berlin with her parents Richard - a sports scientist and 
her trainer - and mother Elizabeth, an artist. 

She
credits her with passing on to her her 'creative talents' as she has 
designed some of the outfits she wore at Wimbledon and other 
tournaments.

Her parents 
were born in part of Poland that was German before WW2.  She speaks 
Polish with her mother and German with her dad and is also fluent in 
English.

Neither Richard or Elizabeth were pushy parents, leaving it up to her to decide if tennis was to be a career choice for her.

'All this happened voluntarily,' she said.  'I had to even beg my dad to give me some time to play when I was growing up.'

When not playing she likes to unwind listening to R&B music and reading.
