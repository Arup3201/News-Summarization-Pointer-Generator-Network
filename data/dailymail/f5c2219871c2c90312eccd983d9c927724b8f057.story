A British Airways jet crashed into an airport building in South Africa after the pilot ignored an instruction and took the wrong taxiway, it was claimed last night.

The right wingtip of the Boeing 747-400 hit an office at OR Tambo airport in Johannesburg on Sunday as it was preparing to take off with 185 passengers on board.

The pilot took the London-bound jumbo jet along a taxiway that was too narrow – rather than one he had been asked to take by air traffic control, it is claimed. Four ground-handling staff in the building suffered minor injuries when they were hit by debris.

All crew and passengers escaped unharmed.

Phindiwe Gwebu of the South African Civil Aviation Authority said an investigation is being carried out.

Fuel spillage was reported from the aircraft after the smash but this was contained by the airport fire services without further incident

A spokesman for OR Tambo airport said all 182 passengers were taken off the 747 to spend the night in a hotel.

A
 statement from the South African Civil Aviation Authority's (SACAA) 
preliminary report, the B747-400 aircraft was cleared for takeoff on 
Runway 03L.

It said: 'It was
 confirmed to the SACAA that the air crew got instructions from the Air 
Traffic Control to taxi using taxi way B. The crew continued onto taxi 
way M which is narrower resulting in the aircraft impacting on an office
 building behind the SAA Technical hangers.

'Four officials (of Bidvest, a South Africa-based distribution services and trading business)
 who were in the building were injured by the debris. The 17 Crew and 
185 passengers who were in the aircraft escaped unharmed and were 
evacuated from the aircraft through door no. 5.

'The South African Civil Aviation Authority wishes a speedy recovery to the injured officials.'

Fuel spillage was reported from the aircraft but this was contained by the airport fire services without further incident.

The
 SACAA dispatched investigators last night and early this morning they 
witnessed the recovery of the aircraft as well as the removal of the 
flight recorder from the aircraft. The investigation continues.

Probe: British Airways has launched an investigation into what caused the 747, similar to this one, to crash just before take-off

She posted on Twitter: 'BA plane crashes into building at J Burg airport. No one injured only the pilot's pride. Not impressed that first class passengers get off before premium economy during an emergency.'

British Airways said an investigation was underway.

A spokesman said: 'A British Airways Boeing 747 was damaged while taxiing at Johannesburg airport. 

'The 182 customers disembarked safely and there were no reported injuries on board the aircraft. 

'Customers were looked after by our staff and provided with hotel accommodation and we are arranging alternative flights for them. 

'We have launched a full investigation into the incident and are giving our assistance to the independent South African Civil Aviation Authority with the matter.'

The South African Civil Aviation Authority said it wishes a 'speedy recovery' to the injured officials. Pictured, Johannesburg's skyline
