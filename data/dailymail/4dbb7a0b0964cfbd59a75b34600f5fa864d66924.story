Phone-hacking at the News of the World became so widespread it was tantamount to a ‘thriving cottage industry’, the Leveson Inquiry into press standards was told yesterday.

At least 28 journalists at the News International media group employed private detective Glenn Mulcaire to carry out more than 2,200 illegal voicemail taps during seven years of eavesdropping on public figures.

One journalist alone – referred to only as ‘A’ – made 1,453 requests, said Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, chaired by Lord Justice Leveson. An astonishing 300million News International emails are being examined by police for evidence of phone hacking.

Almost 700 tape recordings of celebrities’ voicemails were recovered during a police raid on Mulcaire’s offices five years ago.

In his 11,000 pages of notes, detectives found the names and other details of more than 5,000 public figures.

It was clear, Mr Jay said, that bosses
at the paper condoned, or turned a ‘Nelsonian blind eye’ to what had 
become a ‘systemic or cultural problem’. The revelations blow apart 
previous claims by News International that hacking was the work of 
Mulcaire and just one ‘rogue reporter’ – jailed royal editor Clive 
Goodman.

Journalists from the Sun and Daily 
Mirror were also implicated in the scandal as the inquiry heard that 
Mulcaire’s notebooks contained references to work done for the two 
tabloid papers. On the first day of formal hearings into press standards
at the High Court:

■ Lord Leveson stressed that the 
freedom of the press was ‘fundamental’ to the UK’s democracy and way of 
life but warned editors against targeting witnesses who speak out 
against intrusion by journalists.

■ News International records showed 
that ‘Alexander’ – a pseudonym for Mulcaire – was paid between November 
2005 and August 2006 for information relating to ‘Fergie’, ‘SAS’, 
‘Wills’ and ‘Harry and Chelsy’.

■ It emerged that police believe the 
News of the World hacking operations continued until at least 2009. 
David Cameron set up the Leveson Inquiry in July after it was revealed 
that the News of the World hacked the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly
Dowler after she went missing in 2002.

Milly’s father Bob was at the Royal Courts of Justice to hear details of the scale of phone-hacking by the News of the World.

Mulcaire’s book-keeping system was explained to the hearing by Mr Jay.

He said the private investigator wrote
first names down in the top left-hand corner of his notes  recording 
details of every telephone voicemail he illegally intercepted.

Mr Jay said: ‘It’s clear that Goodman wasn’t a rogue reporter. We have at least 27 other News International employees.

References to Max Clifford, left, and Elle Macpherson were found in Mulcaire's notepad, the inquiry was told

‘This fact alone suggests wide-ranging illegal activity within the organisation at the relevant time.’

He added: ‘I suggest that it would not
be unfair to comment that it was at the very least a thriving cottage 
industry. Either News International senior management knew what was 
going on at the time and therefore, at the very least, condoned this 
illegal activity.

‘Or they didn’t and News 
International’s systems failed to the  extent that there was failure in 
supervision, failure of oversight with possible failures of training and
corporate ethos and checking of expenses claims.’

■ Former Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner John Yates was cleared of any wrongdoing  
yesterday, months after being forced to quit over the phone hacking 
scandal.

The decision could pave the way for him to make a legal claim against the Metropolitan Police Association.

The
former Information Commissioner Richard Thomas will be  questioned at 
the inquiry over his handling of an investigation eight years ago into a
private investigator who obtained information for journalists.

Police searched an office of inquiry agent Steve Whittamore in Hampshire in 2003 during ‘Operation Motorman’.

The raid revealed he and three  others had been paid to obtain information for newspapers and other organisations.

Some of the searches breached the Data Protection Act, but others were a lawful way of  finding out information that was already in the public domain quickly, said Mr Jay.

He said that in three years, 305 journalists had asked Whittamore for 13,343 different items of information.

These journalists worked for a total of 21 newspapers and 11 magazines, although some worked for more than one publication.

Some 952 requests were from the Daily Mail, with 58 journalists involved. The Sunday People had made 802 transactions from 50 staff, and the Daily Mirror had 802 transactions from 45 writers.

The Mail on Sunday made 681  transactions with 33 journalists, and the News of the World made 228 transactions from 23 journalists.

Other newspapers involved included the Sunday Times and Times.

Mr Thomas had not supplied  the identities of the journalists, Mr Jay said.

He added that it was ‘not immediately obvious’ why legal proceedings were not taken against them, but  said the former commissioner  had previously declared he could  not be completely confident that there would not be a public interest defence.

Mr Jay said he ‘will be inviting  Mr Thomas’ to expand on his  reasons why.

‘That said, one appreciates that the Whittamore raid took place in March 2003, and some might say that all of this is water under the bridge.’

Warning: Lord Leveson, who is leading the phone-hacking inquiry

Freedom of the press is ‘fundamental’ to protecting democracy, Lord Justice Leveson declared yesterday.

Formally opening his inquiry, he said there was ‘a great deal to applaud in the British press’ – and he would not be limited to finding fault with the media’s work.

‘From the very start I made it clear that I fully consider the freedom of expression and freedom of the press to be fundamental to our democracy and fundamental to our way of life,’ he said. ‘But that freedom must be exercised with others in mind.’

On the subject of regulation, Lord Justice Leveson said the work of the inquiry – which is expected to report its initial findings in September 2012 – could be summed up in one simple question: ‘Who guards the guardians?’ – an apparent reference to who oversees the work of the press.

He said he had encouraged newspaper editors to meet and discuss these issues outside his hearings and submit ideas about how the press could be better regulated.

Any regulation ‘must reflect the fundamental freedoms to which I have referred’, added Lord Justice Leveson. ‘But it must also recognise that “guard the guardians” is not an optional add-on.

‘Neither is it good enough if it does not take account of the legitimate public concern, not only about phone hacking, but also other unethical behaviour not justified by what is truly in the public interest.’

The first part of the inquiry is looking at the culture, practices and ethics of the press in general.

The second part, examining the extent of unlawful activities by journalists, will not begin until detectives have completed their work and any prosecutions have concluded. Robert Jay, counsel to the inquiry, said it will be ‘concerned with the developing law of privacy’. He said a ‘privacy law has begun to emerge’ from an ‘admittedly limited number of cases’ over the past ten years.

‘There will be calls for a statutory privacy law. Such a law could go further than the rights already protected by Article 8 [the right to respect for privacy and family life] of the Convention (on human rights). At the very least, this inquiry will need to address those calls in deciding whether to make any relevant recommendations.’

Mr Jay added: ‘The press holds the powerful to account and is therefore an important curb on potential abuse of executive and corporate power. At its best, the press espouses unpopular causes and gets to the bottom of scandals which would otherwise be left uninvestigated. It is essential in a functioning democracy that the press be permitted to discharge these vital functions.’

Record: Notes made by Glenn Mulcaire aroused suspicions

Suspicion that the Sun and Mirror might also be involved in phone hacking was aroused by notes in the corners of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire’s notebooks.

Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, said it was ‘beginning to receive evidence that phone hacking was not limited to that organisation’.

Referring to Mulcaire’s method of carefully recording every job undertaken, the barrister said actor Jude Law had brought a claim against the Sun for allegedly hacking his phone.

Part of the evidence in support of his case, said Mr Jay, ‘is a name in the Mulcaire notebook which simply states “the Sun” without specifying the individual working there.

‘There is also documentary evidence which we have seen of another name relating to the Mirror.’

The Sun, Britain’s biggest-selling paper since the closure of its News International stablemate the News of the World, formed the bedrock of Rupert Murdoch’s global media empire.

But while being questioned by MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee last week, Murdoch’s son James refused to rule out shutting down the Sun if it was involved in phone hacking.

Responding to the suggestion that Mulcaire hacked phones for the Mirror, a Trinity Mirror spokesman said last night: ‘It was not made clear to the inquiry which newspaper he was referring to nor did he elaborate on the nature of the “evidence” or how it “relates” to the Mirror.

‘The company has no knowledge of ever using Glenn Mulcaire.’
