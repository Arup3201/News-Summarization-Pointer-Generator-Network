Andre Schurrle showed he was a man of many talents after deciding to take the plunge and have a go at bobsleighing at the Winterberg track. 

The former Chelsea man completed a move to Wolfsburg in January and appears to be enjoying his time back in his native Germany. 

The 24-year-old took to Instagram having just completed a run down the intimidating icy track.

He said: 'Awesome experience here in Winterburg.' 

Schurrle's new side are currently second and 11 points behind Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga, with Champions League qualification looking more and more likely. 

The £24million man never quite made the grade in England but appears be flourishing back in Germany alongside another former Chelsea player Kevin de Bruyne.
