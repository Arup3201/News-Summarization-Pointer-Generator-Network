A South Carolina widow has managed to save a piece of sidewalk that her late husband used to declared his love for her more than 52 years ago.

David Hewitt scrawled an affectionate message to his wife Sissy - then Josephine Hope - on a piece of freshly poured concrete along Murray Boulevard in Charleston when they were just 12 years old.

David sadly died in 2008, but his love note was recently rescued amid road work and lives on in Sissy's backyard as a symbol of the couple's enduring love.

Sissy said there was an instant connection when she first met David, who lived just two doors down, at a friend's 'boy-girl party.'

Saved: Sissy Hewitt looks up as she kneels next to a section of sidewalk in which David Hewitt wrote 'David + Sissy' more than 50 years ago, at her home June 2, 2014, in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. His eventual wife--and now widow--recently received the section of the sidewalk

'I can't say it was love. I was 12,' she told Post and Courier, 'but I was totally infatuated with him.'

David felt the same way, and expressed his love by writing 'David + Sissy' in the sidewalk near Limehouse Street soon after.

When David left for military school in Georgia, the couple kept in touch and rekindled their romance during holidays and summer breaks.

They were reunited when both attended the University of South Carolina and they married soon after graduating.

Sissy and David had a baby before returning to Charleston and buying a house on Limehouse Street, just a block away from David's message.

When their family grew to two children and four grandchildren, the sentimental sidewalk remained, becoming a go-to place for family pictures.

Their daughter, Angie Hewitt Chakeris, told the Post Courier the story of the sidewalk is one of her earliest childhood memories.Â 

'I remember thinking, "Oh my gosh, you were dating when you were 12?" That's a little crazy, isn't it?' she told the newspaper

When David Hewitt died in early 2008 after a battle with myeloma, the sidewalk took on even greater importance to the family.

So when Angie drove past it recently and saw orange tape surrounding the site, her heart sank.

She returned straight after work and found the sidewalk was broken but the message intact.

She then contacted City Hall to see if the family could have it, and officials said 'sure' - but only if the family could move it.

So Angie's brother Pitts Hewitt arranged to have a 5-inch thick chunk cut and transported to his mother's house.

A grateful Sissy placed the stone between her home and garage, where she sees it every day.

She told the newspaper that while she misses her husband everyday, she considers herself blessed.'How many people go their whole lives looking for someone to love? And I had that love from age 12.'
