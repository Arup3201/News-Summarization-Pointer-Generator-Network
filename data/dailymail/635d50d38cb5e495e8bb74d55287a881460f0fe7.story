Manchester City defender Micah Richards is set to swap Italian clubs and rejoin his old manager Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan after a frustrating loan spell at Fiorentina. 

Richards ended his 12-year stay at City when he moved to Serie A last summer.

That was a season-long loan that cost the Florence-based club £3.5million, rising to £4.7m if the deal was made permanent.

But Richards has played just five league games for Fiorentina, where he has failed to exert himself on the first team. 

Mancini preferred Pablo Zabaleta to Richards at right back while manager at the Etihad Stadium, but needs reinforcements at the San Siro. 

Inter were humiliated at Sassuolo at the weekend, with players involved in an angry fracas with away fans at the full-time whistle.
