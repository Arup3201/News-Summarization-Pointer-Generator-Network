Police have discovered a man's body they believe to be that of missing Chief Inspector Tim Frohwein who disappeared last weekend after setting off on a hill walk.

The body was discovered at around 1pm today in the Goyt Valley, a popular walking spot in the Peak District by officers searching for the 48-year-old officer.

The man has yet to be formally identified but police say they believe him to be Mr Frohwein, who was reported missing from his Buxton home on Sunday, November 17.

A Derbyshire Police spokesman said they do not believe there to be any suspicious circumstances.

Officers, supported by local Mountain 
Rescue volunteers, had been searching for the 48-year-old since he was 
first reported missing.

Derbyshire
police say Mr Frohwein left his home in Buxton at around 1.20pm and was
seen walking along the Old Roman Road out of the town at about 1.30pm.

Last week, as mountain rescue teams 
were stood down from their search in the rugged hills near Mr Frohwein's
home, his younger son Joel, who will be 19 tomorrow, wrote on Twitter 
that he wished he could turn the clock back to before his father went 
missing.

Joel Frohwein wrote: 'The things I would do to take time back to Saturday.'

A spokesman for Derby Mountain Rescue team said rescue workers had worked from 4pm on Sunday looking for the missing policeman.

Kevin Corcoran said: 'Five mountain 
rescue teams joined forces with four search dogs and one specialist 
trailing dog from Wales to look for Mr Frohwein in the rugged terrain 
that is very close to the town of Buxton.

'We searched hills and woodland but did not find him and so were stood down on Monday evening.'

Mr Frohwein was based at Chesterfield, looking after Amber Valley and Chesterfield, and was previously head of road policing.

He joined the police force in 1987 aged 22 and has worked for 
the Kent, Cheshire and Derbyshire police forces in roles as uniform, 
sergeant and inspector.

He 
is also a trained hostage negotiator, and spent five years working as 
international development director for MxM, an NGO with offices in the 
US, UK, Cyprus and the Middle East.

Mr Frohwein is married to Susan, 54, and has sons Christian, 21, and Joel, 19 tomorrow.

Mr
Frohwein, who studied physical education and economic geography at 
University College, Chester after attending Kingham Hill boarding school
in Oxfordshire was last seen wearing a three-quarter length dark coat, 
pale blue shirt and brown jeans.
