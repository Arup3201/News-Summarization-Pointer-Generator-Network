Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has raised hopes that he might move to Chelsea - after he took over Jose Mourinho's job, coaching the Stamford Bridge side on Football Manager.

Pogba, currently on international duty at the World Cup with France, is regarded as one of the best young midfielders in Europe after a string of quality performances for his national team and Italian champions Juventus.

And with Chelsea among the 21-year-old's potential suitors, Pogba has been pictured 'managing' the Blues against London rivals Arsenal - and picking himself in midfield alongside outgoing club legend Frank Lampard.

Downtime: Pogba takes the chance to get in some Football Manager time during the national team's flight

Tactical genius: The 21-year-old goes for a 4-2-3-1 formation similar to the one used by Jose Mourinho

Loves himself: Pogba has bought his virtual self as Chelsea manager in the management simulator

Subs: Banega, Schurrle, Eto'o, De Sciglio, Chiellini, Willian, Luiz

The midfield powerhouse has also signed fellow Juventus player Kevin Asamoah at left back and Real Madrid's Jese to lead the line.

The footage, released by the French Football Federation after the 5-2 win over Switzerland, shows Pogba lining up as Chelsea's number 15 in a defensive midfield role with Eden Hazard, Juan Mata and Oscar in front of him.

And Gary Cahill and Branislav Ivanovic form Chelsea's centre back pairing as Pogba take on London rivals Arsenal, with no place in the fictional side for captain John Terry.

His full line-up in a 4-2-3-1 formation includes Petr Cech, Asamoah, Cahill, Ivanovic, Cesar Azpilicueta, Pogba, Lampard, Hazard, Oscar, Mata and Jese.

Valencia's Ever Banega, Andre Schurrle, Samuel Eto'o, AC Milan right back Mattia De Sciglio, Juventus team-mate Giorgio Chiellini, Willian and David Luiz are on the bench.

Happy: Pogba's team-mates appear in good spirits after their 5-2 win over Switzerland in Salvador

Natural choice: If Pogba joins Chelsea it won't be alongside his favoured Football Manager partner, Lampard

Pogba left Old Trafford at the end of 
his contract in 2012 after falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson but has 
since gone on to become one of most sought-after midfielders in Europe.

He
 has been a key part of Juventus' title-winning midfield this year and 
started France's opening game against Honduras before coming off the 
bench in their 5-2 win over Switzerland.

Juve are understood to be willing to sell Pogba despite protestations that he is a key figure at the club.

Big win: Pogba celebrates against Switzerland - could he be in a Chelsea shirt next season?
