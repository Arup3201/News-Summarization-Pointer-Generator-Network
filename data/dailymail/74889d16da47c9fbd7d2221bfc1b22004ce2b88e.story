The Queen and Prince Charles have been given at least 39 chances to veto legislation before it became law, it was revealed today.

Secret papers show the most senior Royals have had numerous opportunities to torpedo bills that could change their powers, including a law that would have given parliament sole authority to sanction strikes on Iraq during the 1999 war.

The extent of the influence the Queen and
 Prince Charles have over legislation has been laid bare 
because Downing Street lost a legal battle to keep details secret.

Revealed: The Queen and Prince Charles have been asked to consent at least 39 laws, some of which they have vetoed, Cabinet documents show

Ministers and Whitehall mandarins must 
ask them to approve or veto legislation across most areas of government 
if it may impact on their interests, like the Crown estate and the 
Prince's Duchy of Cornwall estate.

The Queen's veto blocked the Military Actions Against Iraq Bill in 1999, a backbench bill making it necessary that Parliament must first consent before Tony Blair's government could launch air strikes against Saddam Hussein's Iraq.

It was put forward by anti-war Labour MP Tam Dalyell but it failed as it did not receive the Royal Assent.

Mr Dalyell said at the time: 'I am not going crawling to the Queen. This has nothing to do with her.'

The Palace was also asked to agree bills linked to higher education, paternity pay, identity cards and child maintenance.

The Whitehall legal pamphlet containing the information admits that if they do not give consent: 'a major plank of the bill must be removed'.

System: The senior Royals are asked about legislation from Westminster that might have an impact on their own interests or estates

The Palace said today that Royals only use their veto if they are advised to by cabinet members or civil servants.

But critics say it shows the amount of power in the monarchy's hands.

Prince Charles has been criticised in the past for the number of letters he has written to ministers giving his views on policies.

Influence: Cornish MP Andrew George says the revelations show the power the Queen and Prince Charles have over Parliament

Academic John Kirkhope, who fought the Government to release the documents, said: 'There has been an implication that these prerogative powers are quaint and sweet but actually there is real influence and real power, albeit unaccountable.'

Andrew George, Liberal Democrat MP for 
St Ives, part of which includes Duchy of Cornwall land, said: 'This is opening the eyes of those who believe the Queen only has a ceremonial role.

'It shows the Royals are playing an active role in the democratic 
process and we need greater transparency in parliament so we can be 
fully appraised of whether these powers of influence and veto are really
 appropriate. At any stage this issue could come up and surprise us and 
we could find parliament is less powerful than we thought it was.'

The Queen's Duchy of Lancaster estate, which includes 19,000 hectares of land and 10 castles, pays for running Sandringham and Balmoral. Prince Charles's Duchy of Cornwall brings in Â£18million a year.

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: 'It is a long established convention that the Queen is asked by parliament to provide consent to those bills which parliament has decided would affect crown interests. The sovereign has not refused to consent to any bill affecting crown interests unless advised to do so by ministers.'

A spokesman for Prince Charles at Clarence House added: 'In modern times, the Prince of Wales has never refused to consent to any bill affecting Duchy of Cornwall interests, unless advised to do so by ministers. Every instance of the prince's consent having been sought and given to legislation is a matter of public record.'
