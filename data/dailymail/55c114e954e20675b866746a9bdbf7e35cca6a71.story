Victim: Tony Abrahams, 47, was stabbed three times on his own landing, it is claimed

A father was stabbed repeatedly by burglars in front of his wife and daughter when he caught them raiding his house last night.

The man, named by neighbours as Tony Abrahams, 47, walked into the three intruders on his landing after hearing his 23-year-old daughter, Jade, wake up and scream as they tried to take a television from her room.

He was awoken by the noise and went to investigate, it is claimed. He tried to open his bedroom door, but found the burglars on the other side were holding it shut.

The self-employed painter and decorator managed to force open the door, only to find himself confronted by three masked burglars on his landing.

In the moments that followed, Tony was repeatedly stabbed by the intruders, who then fled the £200,000 Luton home.

The trio, who all wore balaclavas, are thought to have made off in a black Astra.

Mr Abrahams, said to be in a serious but stable condition, was taken to Luton and Dunstable Hospital after his wife Catrina, 52, and daughter raised the alarm at 3.25am.

Today, Tony's two daughters briefly appeared to say: 'Dad is doing alright.'

The gang are believed to have forced their way into the property as the family slept on Saturday night. Detectives say the three are thought to be aged between 14 and 20.

Bedfordshire Police today confirmed no arrests have been made.

Detective Constable Mo Hussain has appealed for details from witnesses who may have been in the area at the time or may have seen the three offenders either before or after the attack.

Investigation: Officers outside the home of Mr Abrahams. They are seeking three men aged between 14 and 20

Mr Abraham's two daughters today told reporters: 'Dad is doing alright'

He said: 'This was an appalling attack on a family man within his own home and I would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak with us.

'While the victim has suffered some very nasty injuries, he is in a stable condition and has responded very well to treatment.

'There are a number of live leads and we are hopeful that we will establish the relevant evidence and identify the offenders.'

Bedforshire Police are looking for three black males around 20 years old.

A statement described the first 
offender as a black male with light skin, around 20 years of age, five 
feet one inch tall. The second offender was also a black male, five feet
ten inches tall. The third offender was a black male, around 20 years 
old.

Police say some property is missing.

Detective Inspector Iain Morgan, who 
is leading the hunt for the intruders, said that on hearing the sounds 
of the break-in, Tony had got out of bed and went to investigate.

'He went to leave the room and then found the bedroom door was being held shut from the other side,' said the officer.

DI Morgan said anyone with information should contact Bedfordshire Police. He said 'I am appealing to members of the public, who may remember someone coming home really late in the early hours of Saturday morning, maybe hot and dishevelled and not themselves, to contact us.'

It echoes the chilling case of hardworking pensioner Joseph Griffiths, 73, who was stabbed in his living room last year when he went to investigate noises.

His wife Judith, 72, woke to shouts and screams downstairs in their £1million London home.

She found her husband in a pool of blood and called paramedics but they were unable to save him.

In February last year an elderly couple were stabbed to death by their Polish neighbour who had only been in the country for a week.

Killer Ireneusz Bartnowski, 22, was jailed for 34 years after attacking grandparents Guiseppe and Caterina Massaro in their bedroom in Wolverhampton.
