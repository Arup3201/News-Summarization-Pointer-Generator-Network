Glenn Whelan has slammed his Stoke City teammates and labelled their display at Blackburn as 'the worst performance' following their embarrassing exit.

Mark Hughes' side took the lead at Ewood Park but were outplayed and outfought as the Lancashire club came away with a 4-1 win.

The Irish international didn't hold back and heavily criticised the performance.

Speaking to the Stoke Sentinel he said: 'It was terrible. It was the worst performance I've ever seen a Stoke City side put out; we didn't want to fight or do the basics.

'Fair play to Blackburn, they came out and properly dug us out.

'We weren't prepared to work hard enough. It's ok when things are going well, we've got good players then but when you want to fight and you want to knuckle down maybe we haven't got enough in the dressing room.

'Hopefully the manager has seen that today and will show it next week because it's just not good enough; as a team, as an 11. Players didn't really want to be out there and you could see that after the first 10 minutes. Credit to Blackburn they deserved to go through.'

Stoke were hampered by a number of injuries in the build up to the game and had Geoff Cameron sent off in the first half but Whelan feels they have no excuse. 

'Injuries are an easy excuse. We've still got 11 players to go out and give Blackburn a game.

'We were 1-0 up but we gave away sloppy goals and it was really disappointing today because we thought we could go on and do something.

'We've sat down and had words between ourselves but that will stay within the dressing room. It's not nice coming away from a 4-1 defeat to Manchester City in mid-week but you think ok, it's the champions. Not against Blackburn, no disrespect. They fully deserved to win and I don't think they had to work very hard to get it.

'What the manager has said will stay in the dressing room. Things have been got off chests. It doesn't matter how good a player you are if you are not prepared to put the work in; the hard yards and the graft. If you don't do that then you don't deserve to be wearing the jersey.

'Hopefully in the next week some lads will have to reflect on that.'

Despite the setback, Whelan wants his side to move on from this disappointment and concentrate on the rest of the season. 

'It's hard work from Monday, going out and getting our season going again. We were thinking we had a good chance of going a long way in this competition.

'It wasn't to be but we have to keep our season going, get our standards up and make sure the season does not slip us by because we can still achieve something this year.'
