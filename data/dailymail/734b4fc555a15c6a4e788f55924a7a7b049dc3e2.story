Morgan Schneiderlin has claimed that he is happy at Southampton 'for now', but refused to commit his future to Southampton amid a summer of transfer speculation.

The Frenchman scored twice for the Saints as they beat West Ham 3-1 at Upton Park on Saturday, and when asked about his future after the game, Schneiderlin said he was focused on Southampton.

'It was a long summer, but now I'm focused on my team. For now, it is Southampton. I will keep playing and doing my best,' he told BBC Sport.

Brace: Morgan Schneiderlin netted twice for Southampton as they beat West Ham 3-1 at Upton Park

Happy: Despite a summer of unrest, the Frenchman claims he is conent at St. Mary's...for now

Form: The midfielder has started the season well, and is pictured scoring the first of his two goals on Saturday

This summer has seen an exodus at St. Mary's, with Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren all leaving the club for pastures new.

Schneiderlin himself had been linked with a move away, but the club insisted that he was not for sale.

Upon hearing this news in July, Schneiderlin remarked on Twitter: '6 years of an amazing journey #saintsfc DESTROYED in one hour!'

When pressed on this summer's speculation, the midfielder was quick to admit that it has been a difficult few months.

'I'm not going to hide the fact that it has been a long summer with a lot of speculation and a lot of thinking on my side to know if I have to make a big step.'

'The club showed that they wanted to keep me. I always had respect for the fans and club. I always give my best and I was just thinking about my future.

'Today it is clear and I just have to concentrate on my football now.'

Outplayed: Despite links to Spurs and Arsenal, Schneiderlin helped Southampton to their first win this weekend

It was widely reported in July that Tottenham were interested in the 24-year-old's services, a move that would have seen the Saints midfielder link up with former boss Mauricio Pochettino at White Hart Lane.

Schneiderlin has been on the south coast since 2008, when he joined from boyhood club Strasbourg, and played a considerable role in Southampton's whirlwind rise from League One to the Premier League.
