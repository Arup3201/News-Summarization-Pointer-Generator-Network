A nurse has apparently shot dead a 79-year-old patient at the nursing home where she worked before turning the gun on herself.

In a case that has baffled investigators, Aimee Larkin, a 42-year-old licensed nurse from Dunmore, Pennsylvania apparently brought a semi-automatic handgun to her night shift at Abington Manor in Clarks Summit on Monday.

Shortly before 5.30pm, she fatally shot Howard Kinney in the chest before shooting herself in the head, South Abington Township Police Chief Robert Gerrity said. Other workers found the bodies.

Bizarre: Aimee Larkin apparently shot dead a patient at a nursing home before committing suicide on Monday

Tragic: Authorities said Larkin, who appears to have a partner, left, had brought the gun with her to work before firing one shot at Howard Kinney's chest at 5.30pm. She then shot herself in the head

Investigators have said they have no idea why Larkin would carry out the murder-suicide.

'We're actively investigating this, conducting a lot of interviews, but right now we're at a loss, actually, as to what the motive was,' he said.

He said investigators don't know whether 
the weapon was hers and said that it was unclear whether their relationship went beyond that of caregiver and patient.

They did not leave a note and employees at Abington Manor said they haven't noticed any unusual behavior from the nurse or the patient, WNEP reported.

'It's a very bizarre incident,' Gerrity said, adding that 'we may never know' the motive.

Larkin had worked there since 2011 and her Facebook profile appears to indicate that she was married. Kinney, from Overfield Township, had lived there for about two years.

Home: She had worked at the residence, which provides care for elderly residents, for 2 years

Jeanne Moore, a spokeswoman for the nursing home just north of Scranton, said in a statement that officials were shocked by the deaths.

'We are cooperating fully with law enforcement officials at this time and are hopeful that their efforts will help us to understand this tragedy,' she said.

She added that officials 'are focused on the well-being of our patients, residents and staff'.

Authorities said the incident was isolated and that no one else at the residence was in danger.

It is unclear whether the weapon belonged to Larkin but investigations continue.

Abington Manor provides short- and long-term care for elderly residents and people with chronic or prolonged illness, according to its owner Genesis HealthCare.
