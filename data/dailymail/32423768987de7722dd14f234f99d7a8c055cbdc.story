A florist is being sued by the Washington State Attorney General for refusing to sell flowers for a gay wedding, it emerged today.

A lawsuit was filed on Tuesday on behalf of Attorney General Bob Ferguson against Barronelle Stutzman, the owner of Arlene's Flowers in Richland, Washington.

The row emerged last month when Stutzman refused to sell flowers to longtime customers Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed for their wedding in September.

Row: A legal fight has broken out over Arlene's Flowers in Richland, Washington, after the owner refused to provide flowers for a gay couple's wedding

She told the couple she would not provide them with her service 'because of [her] relationship with Jesus Christ'.

Ferguson, who had written to the florist asking her to change her stance two weeks ago, says she is violating the state's Consumer Protection Act, which bars any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

'As Attorney General, it is my job to enforce the laws of the state of Washington,' Ferguson said in a statement.

'Under the Consumer Protection Act, it is unlawful to discriminate against customers based on sexual orientation. If a business provides a product or service to opposite-sex couples for their weddings, then it must provide same sex couples the same product or service.'

Stutzman on the other hand has won the backing of several groups and has set up a fighting fund to pay for her legal case.

The small business' Facebook page has become a hotbed of debate on gay marriage and a group has been set up calling for the shop to boycotted.

On the page Stutzman posted: 'To those who have and do support us, we want to thank you for all your concern and phone calls. Many have requested a place to send financial support to help with legal defense. We have set up a deposit only account with our local Key Bank.'

It goes on to provide the bank details.

In a statement posted at the time of the refusal, Stutzman refused to back down on what she called 'her conviction'.

Offended: Robert Ingersoll says he felt compelled to complain to the Attorney General over Baronnelle Stutzman's refusal to provide his wedding flowers

'This customer has been in many times and purchased flowers from us,' she wrote.

'When it came to doing his wedding, I said,  'I could not do it because of my relationship with Jesus Christ.' He thanked me and said, 'He respected my opinion.' We talked and gave each other a hug and he left.

'Since that day, we have received many comments on same sex marriages. I believe, biblically, that marriage is between a man and a woman. That is my conviction, yours may be different.'

'I have hired all walks of people in different circumstances, and had the privilege of working with some very talented people that happen to be gay.'

'I’m sure there are many places you can purchase flowers, if you choose not to purchase them from Arlene’s, because of your beliefs, then I certainly understand.'

Lawyers on her behalf wrote to the Attorney General making clear she would fight his stance.

'Discrimination is not the issue. Although gay marriage may be legal in Washington for the time being, the concept offends...Ms Stutzman and many others in Washington,'  the letter said.

The very same day the legal bid was launched a worker left the florist in objection to her boss' stance.

Eryn Hugo, who had worked there for a 
year and a half told the Tri-City Herald: 'Some things are more important than money, and I felt making a stand by
 quitting -- just not doing something completely against my beliefs -- 
was very important to me.'

Ferguson wants a permanent injunction against the florist forcing her to comply - possibly leaving her with a $2,000 fine.

Ingersoll said it was a difficult decision to raise the issue with the Attorney General but the couple ultimately felt it was the right thing to do.

Ingersoll told the Herald: 'It really hurt because it was somebody I knew. We laid awake all night. It was eating at our souls. There was never a question she'd be the one to do our flowers. She does amazing work.'

'We're both passionate about seeing people succeed and that nobody should be hurt or in pain.'

'This is one of those things -- it's very hurtful. I probably haven't felt this much pain since I was in high school and people called me names, and I'm 42.'

'People are going to hate us,' he added. 'That is sad and makes me unhappy. I know people are going to come out of the woodwork and going to be hateful. I don't say hateful things. I'm not that kind of person.'
