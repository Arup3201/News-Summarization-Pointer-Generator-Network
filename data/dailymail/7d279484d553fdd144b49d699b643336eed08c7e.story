Tony McGuire (pictured today) has been spared jail after destroying his family's £300,000 home with a sledgehammer

An electrician who destroyed his family's £300,000 house with a sledgehammer in a feud over his inheritance has walked free from court today.

Father-of-six Tony McGuire battered the semi-detached house to pieces and caused £126,000 of damage.

McGuire, 50, was left fuming when his father left the home to his brother Terry in his will when he died.

Cardiff Crown Court heard McGuire had carried out expensive extensions to the house and lived at the property for two years after his father died.

But he flew into a rage when he was handed an eviction notice by his younger brother Terry McGuire, 44.

The court heard he took a sledgehammer to the family home while he was watched by astonished neighbours.

Electrician McGuire targeted the extensions and garage which he built himself - leaving a pile of rubble of bricks, roofing tiles, glass and insulation.

Prosecutor Jason Howells said: 'It appears Terry tried to reach an amicable agreement for Tony to live in the house - but no agreement was reached.

'Police attended the property while the damage was being caused but due to confusion about who owned the home they took no action.'

The court heard £126,000 of damage was caused to the home in the Birchgrove suburb of Cardiff.

McGuire admitted causing the damage to police - but said the will of his father Allan McGuire had been 'created fraudulently'.

He had contested the will in civil courts but had lost after their sister Tina had supported brother Terry.

But McGuire said he couldn't accept that the house didn't belong to him.

Eugene Egan, defending, said McGuire 'lost focus and judgement' when he decided to hammer the house to rubble.

Mr
Egan said: 'For 15 years before his father's death he had been the 
person who was going to inherit the home and he felt sore about that 
change.

'When people fall out within a family context it can bring out the very worst in someone.

'He thought he had a moral right to 
do what he did. Sadly, a moral right didn’t equate to a lawful excuse 
and gave him no defence whatsoever.'

He
said McGuire has since been made bankrupt but was a 'man of good 
character' who had never had any trouble with the law before.

'It was a crime committed out of 
bitterness and resentment which led a good person like yourself to 
commit an act of very considerable evil. You have also caused inestimable harm to your own immediate family'

- Judge Philip Richards

Mr Egan said McGuire's wife Darriel is registered blind - and he has six children aged 33 to school age.

The court heard he is the sole breadwinner in the family for his three dependent children.

Judge Philip Richards told him: 'It 
was an ugly crime committed against members of your own family which has
caused substantial loss to a property which your father decided they 
were entitled to.

'It 
was a crime committed out of bitterness and resentment which led a good 
person like yourself to commit an act of very considerable evil. You have also caused inestimable harm to your own immediate family.'

Judge Richards said he had 'nothing 
but sympathy' for McGuire's brother who suffered 'enormous pain' as a 
result of his determination to 'get even'.

He told McGuire: 'It seems that a getting even mentality would gain nothing for others who are entirely innocent.

McGuire, who pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage, was given a two year prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to do 300 hours of unpaid work

McGuire caused £126,000 of damage to the house after he was left fuming when his father left the home to his brother Terry

'Given your excellent history and the appalling harm a substantial prison sentence would have on your children I can just about suspend the sentence I must pass.'

McGuire, of Cardiff, pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage.

He was given a two year prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to do 300 hours of unpaid work.
