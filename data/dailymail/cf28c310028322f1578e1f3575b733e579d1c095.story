Sweeping is a tedious task but now a new ‘smart bin’ could help save you from all that bending down with a dust pan.

The Bruno Smartcan is said to be the first internet connected combined kitchen bin and vacuum cleaner.

Using sensors on the front of the bin, it is able to sense when dust and debris from the kitchen floor is swept towards it with a brush, turning on a vacuum to suck up the offending mess.

The Bruno Smartcan (pictured) uses sensors to detect when you want the lid to open or when dirt has been swept close so it can activate its integrated vacuum. It also has an integrated bag store and charging cord

Bruno comes with an integrated bag dispenser that additionally sends alerts to a smartphone when the owner is getting low on bags, and it can send reminders when it is time to take out the rubbish.

Developed by inventors Jim Howard and Lori Montag, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, the bin is able to clean up dog hair and spilt breakfast cereal and crumbs, sucking it up directly into the bin bag.

It is the perfect invention for the house proud - a substance that means clothes will never stain, glass will not mist and kitchen surfaces automatically shed their germs.

Scientists  have developed a ‘self-cleaning’ coating that can be sprayed  onto materials.

The substance, made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles, works because it is very, very water resistant.

Any moisture which touches it turns into a ball and rolls away, cleaning up dust in its path.

The breakthrough, by chemists at University College London, comes after years of research into highly water-resistant - or ‘superhydrophobic’ - substances.  

It also features a motion sensitive hands-free lid that opens automatically.

The inventors said: ‘Bruno and its patents pending technologies have been many months in the making.

‘The powerful vortex vacuum feature will deliver every dog hair, cheerio and grain of dirt directly into the trash bag.

‘No more stopping, no more scooping, just place the broom in front of the vacuum inlet to start the suction and Bruno will do the rest.

‘Bruno will also remind you to take the trash out on trash day, and alert you when you are low on Bruno Bags.’

The pair is hoping to attract support for their invention on Kickstarter.

They said the Bruno ‘smartcan’ can run for 30 days on its battery before needing to be recharged. 

 

Dust swept close to the base of the Bruno Smartcan activates the vacuum, which sucks it directly into the bin. The vacuum  is powerful enough so suck up spilt breakfast cereal, dust and hair, while its integrated bag dispenser knows when you need to buy new bags

An extendable recharging cord is built into a flip up section just behind the main lid.

Users can buy custom-fitted bags for the Bruno, which fit into its dispenser, or use standard bin bags. 

The bin has a capacity of 59 litres (13 gallons).

It is expected to cost $248 (£160), although early buyers can pre-order it for $139 (£90).

The Bruno bin comes in five colours including white (above) and will last for 30 days on a single charge
