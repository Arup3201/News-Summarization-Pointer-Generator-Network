NBC has added Johnny Weir and Tara 
Lipinski to its Kentucky Derby line up as fashion correspondents after 
their star turn as figure skating commentators at the Sochi Olympic 
Games.

The two former 
figure skaters, who earned the Olympic bronze medal in 2008 and the 
Olympic gold in 1998 respectively, made a name for themselves by wearing
 over-the-top outfits throughout the Russian winter games in February.

Their
 keen fashion eyes will be in full force next Saturday at the storied 
horse race where attendees try to out do one another on their hat 
selections.

Foray into fashion: Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski (seen together at the Oscars in March) made a splash for their sartorial choices while working as figure skating commentators at the Sochi Games

Their involvement also shows how the network's coverage now reflects one of the most female-friendly televised sporting events of the year.

The image of cigar-chomping race fans no longer applies to horse racing's signature event. Slightly more than half of NBC's Derby viewers last year were women attracted to the party, the Nielsen ratings company said.

No other major TV sports event, with the exception of the Olympics, is so weighted toward female viewers, NBC said.

'It's not just a two-minute race,' said Rob Hyland, coordinating producer for the NBC Sports Group.

Bling: The duo will be focusing their attention on the fashions being worn by celebrities at the Derby as opposed to the costumes on the ice like they did in Sochi

'Of course, the two-minute race is extremely important, but our job is to capture the venue and the day — it's a huge celebration — as creatively and poignantly as possible.'

Hyland produced NBC's ice skating coverage in Sochi and saw firsthand how the rookie analyst team of Weir and Lipinski captured attention, primarily for their sense of style.

Their stars rising, the team was added to Access Hollywood's coverage of the Academy Awards, and now NBC's coverage of the Derby, scheduled May 3 from Churchill Downs in Kentucky.

'We've always loved loud fashion and sort of bonded over it,' Lipinski said.

'The whole Olympics experience was a bit of a surprise. We came in and were focused on doing a good job as rookies. But we're young and we like to have fun. The fashion was specifically for us every day and it was like, “Oh, people are watching. This is fun.”’

Particularly for Weir; fans anticipated his wardrobe choices. Continuing their collaboration post-Olympics was a natural, Weir said, since they both follow fashion trends and designers closely as consumers.

Appealing to audiences: More than half of the television audience of the Kentucky Derby were women so NBC's decision to enlist Weir and Lipinski shows them catering to the viewer's interest in fashion

'We've grown up as entertainers, and going out the door, what you're wearing is often the loudest statement you can make,' Weir said.

They're also no strangers to the horse racing world.

Lipinski rode horses when she was younger and Weir was more active, competing in equestrian events before he focused on figure skating.

Weir said he attended the 2010 Kentucky Derby as a fan, earning money by betting on the winning horse. He also wore a giant, fur-covered sombrero, he said, raising anticipation for his outfit next week.

'I'm not such a sports guy, aside from what people may think,' he said.

'I love figure skating, I love my job, but aside from that, I prefer to run in meadows and chase butterflies.'

Weir’s time back from Russia has been turbulent as he and his husband have been rotating back and forth between divorce and reconciliation after the skater’s lawyer husband released a photo showing that Weir bit and hit him during a violent outburst.

Most recently, Weir and his estranged husband Victor Voronov announced they were remaining apart just hours after deciding to give things another ago.

It's over...again: Victor Voronov and Johnny Weir (pictured at NY Fashion Week in 2012) called off their reconciliation last week just hours after the estranged couple said they were getting back together

As part of his conditions for reconciliation, Weir reportedly issued a five-page document including a list of no-no's like extramarital sexting and mutual masturbation and bi-yearly STD tests from both parties. The latest reports have the couple remaining apart.

The subject matter of the storied race will undoubtedly remain more staid and civil, however.

NBC's coverage is preceded by four hours on the NBC Sports cable network. The first hour of NBC's three-hour Derby coverage will be entertainment-focused, including red carpet arrivals coverage.

NBC is also distributing to its local affiliates stories offering tips on how to throw Kentucky Derby parties, and how to mix the event's signature drinks.

The Derby coverage will also mark the NBC debut of Josh Elliott, who came to the network from ABC's 'Good Morning America.'

He will be doing a series of taped pieces that are part of the coverage, along with celebrity interviews, Hyland said.

NBC's Derby telecast in 2013 was seen by 16.2 million viewers — 51 per cent of them women — and was the second most-watched Derby in 25 years.
