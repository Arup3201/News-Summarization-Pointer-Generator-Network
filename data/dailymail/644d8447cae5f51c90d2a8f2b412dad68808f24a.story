Tragic: Caleb Justice, 15, (left)  and Brett McLean, 26, were on a church outing when they fell into the water

Wasco County's Chief Deputy Lane Magill, told kval.com the flow of the water kept the bodies lodged beneath a ledge, preventing them from floating downriver.

The pair were were
on an outing for Experience The Valley Bible Camp - the group is made up of 100 staff and high school students from several churches in the
area.

Justice belonged to River Rock Church of Camas and McLean was a volunteer with another church

Sheriff's investigators said they 
received a report of two people who had slipped and fallen into the pool
at the base of White River Falls just after 2 p.m. Monday.

Search: Divers scoured the water at the base of White River Falls for the pair

Grim discovery: The bodies were found at about 5:45 p.m. yesterday by a diver. The flow of the water kept the bodies lodged beneath the ledge

Initially it was thought Caleb Justice had slipped and fell while taking a photo and McLean ahd jumped in after him.

But Mr Magill said it now appeared that the pair had slipped on the rocks at the same time.

'Once you get sucked into that it'll hold you in that pool,' he said.

Bystanders were unable to rescue them, despite throwing ropes to the pair.

Mr Magill explained that although 
there had not been any drownings in the same area before the rocks are 
slippy due to the moisture.

Closed: After a closure to allow for an investigation, the area will soon reopen for public access

Location: The accident happened about four miles east of Tygh Valley, Ore. south of The Dalles

Pastor Paul Ireland of River Rock, which Justice belonged to told Fox 12 the teenager was 'a joy to be around.'

'Our hearts are deeply saddened by 
this loss, these two precious people. We will continue to pray for and 
support their families through this whole ordeal,' he added. 

The area was cordoned off by investigators but will soon re-open to the public.
