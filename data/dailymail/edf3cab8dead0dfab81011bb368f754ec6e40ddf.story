Fears the HPV vaccine promotes sexual promiscuity in young girls are unfounded, scientists say.

A study in Canada has found the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine has had little impact on the sexual behaviour of teenage girls.

HPV is a common sexually transmitted infection. 

Although in many cases the virus goes away by itself, and may cause no symptoms, it can cause genital warts or cervical cancer.

There are more than 100 types of HPV infection, with around 40 affecting the genital area. 

Both men and women can carry the virus, but smoking, having multiple sexual partners and losing your virginity at an early age are all risk factors.

Most women will have an HPV infection at some point in their lives, usually without knowing it.

But others types of HPV are known to increase the risk of developing cancer, particularly cervical cancer. 

Since 2006, the HPV vaccine has been licensed in almost 100 countries, including Canada.

In the UK the vaccine was introduced in 2008. 

Many of these countries have national HPV vaccination programmes to protect young girls against the virus before they become sexually active. 

However there are concerns the vaccine - which guards against four types of the virus shown to cause cervical cancer - may give girls a false sense of security about their risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections.

That false sense of security could, some experts argue, lead young girls to engage in riskier sexual activity.

But  researchers at Queen's University in Ontario claim they have disproved the theory.

Dr Leah Smith, lead author of the study, said: 'These findings suggest fears of increased risky sexual behaviour following HPV vaccination are unwarranted and should not be a barrier to vaccinating at a young age.'

Her team analysed 260,000 girls, of whom around half were eligible for Ontario's publicly funded, school-based HPV vaccination programme during the first two school years it was offered (2007/08 and 2008/09).

The researchers followed the girls until March 31 of their Grade 12 year.

Around six per cent of girls became pregnant or contracted an STI between grades 10 and 12.

This equates to 10,187 pregnancies and 6,259 cases of non-HPV-related sexually transmitted infections. 

Dr Linda Lévesque, senior author, said: 'Neither HPV vaccination nor programme eligibility increased the risk of pregnancy nor non-HPV-related STIs among females aged 14 to 17 years.

'The results of the study can be used by physicians, public health providers and policy makers to address public and parental concerns about HPV vaccination and promiscuity.' 

The study was published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.
