Louis van Gaal has told his Manchester United critics they don't know what they are taking about.

United manager Van Gaal faces Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday on the back of a five-game winning run but has still faced criticism.

Former United defender Gary Neville has said that Sunday's game will be like watching two pub teams while former assistant manager Mike Phelan has suggested Van Gaal's training methods must be responsible for the club's injuries.

But today Van Gaal said: 'I don't watch the English TV so I don't know what they say.

'But I don't think how somebody living outside the community of Manchester United can judge how we are doing.

'The criticism is based on no facts. I analyse everything but if this talk is based on no facts then I say "no".'

United face Liverpool on Sunday with the club's great rivals mired in poor form.

Van Gaal revealed that only four players - Daley Blind, Chris Smalling, Luke Shaw and Angel di Maria - remain injured and conceded that he is surprised by Liverpool's struggles.

'I thought they would do better but the Premier League is not easy,' he said.

'Liverpool have been a bit unlucky but they have to survive and manage that.'
