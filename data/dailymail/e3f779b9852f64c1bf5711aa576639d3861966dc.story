Golf ball-sized hailstones, destructive winds and torrential rain have battered parts of Brisbane after a rare and dangerous super cell thunderstorm struck the city on Thursday afternoon.

More than 82,000 people were left without power after the severe storm, which led to winds of 141 km/h when it struck south-east-Queensland at about 4:45pm, the ABC reports.

The wind speed, which is typical of a category two cyclone, led to the uprooting of trees and damage to at least 300 power lines. 

Queensland Premier Campbell Newman confirmed troops from the army barracks were also called in to help mop up what was described by insurers as a catastrophic event.

Although the storms had cleared by about 8:20pm, Queensland police issued a statement on Thursday night warning motorists of expected delays and lane closures on Friday due to the ongoing clean-up of storm damage.

Queensland Fire and Emergency was overwhelmed with over 1,000 calls for assistance by 8pm. It issued a tweet requesting callers to 'pls [sic] help yourself first where possible'.  

More than 13 roads were closed across the city due to water and debris and all rail, bus and ferry services were halted.

Other areas - including Inala, Bowen Hills, and the CBD - experienced flash flooding, with rescue services urging people to steer clear of driving on flooded roads.

'Energex crews will continue working throughout the night but some of the worst affected areas may not have power restored until tomorrow,' the power company wrote on Twitter at about 8pm.   

Queensland Premier Campbell Newman says all available emergency personnel have been mobilised to help with the clean-up.

'The defence minister has authorised the call out of the defence force and the troops from the army barracks will be supporting the SES,' he told the Seven Network.

'So we are getting in as many people as we can on the job this evening. We want people to be safe; there are all sorts of hazards out there.'

By about 8:20pm, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a statement saying that the immediate threat of severe thunderstorms has passed.

The weather bureau issued a severe warning for Brisbane city, Ipswich, Logan, Redland and Moreton Bay earlier in the day after detecting dangerous thunderstorms in a number of areas.  

Large hailstones catapulted by destructive winds up to 141km/h slammed into high rise buildings and vehicles in the CBD and surrounding suburbs leaving a trail of destruction. 

Roads were littered with shattered glass, fallen powerlines, trees, road signs and other debris, and some central streets turned into rivers after torrential rain. 

At least four light planes were flipped in severe winds at Archerfield Airport causing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage.  

City worker Angela Harper said she and her coworkers were terrified when the windows on their office building started to buckle.

'We are 13 floors up and the whole company was freaking out because there was water leaking in and the windows started to buckle. There were people screaming,' she said.

'I've been through myriad cyclones in Townsville but this was a lot worse and far scarier. I've never experienced anything like it in my life.'

The Bureau of Meteorology said in a statement issued late on Thursday afternoon that 'golf ball hail and a 141 km/h wind gust has been recorded from the southern suburbs,' .

Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) was urging residents in affected areas to prepare for severe storms on Thursday evening.

It advised moving loose outdoor items indoors, securing items difficult to move such as swing sets and trampolines, and moving cars undercover and away from trees.

'When the storm approaches seek shelter indoors and never under trees,' a statement from QFES said. 

Campbell Fuller, a spokesman for the Insurance Council of Australia, says insurers have already received thousands of calls and that's expected to rise rapidly.

'Don't forget this happened during peak hour so many households are yet to look at damage,' he said.

'Tonight the insurance council declared a catastrophe for the Brisbane hail storm.'

The thunderstorm caused traffic chaos, leaving some commuters stranded for hours after roads were blocked and most train and bus services either cancelled or delayed.

Roofs and awnings were torn from some buildings, including the Wesley Kangaroo Point Uniting Church, built in 1980.

Flash flooding was also reported at Inala in Brisbane's west and Bowen Hills in the inner north.

A number of schools have been severely damaged and will remain closed on Friday. 

Parliament was suspended for 15 minutes after large hailstones pummelled the Speakers Green.

The storm weakened as it headed north and the Bureau of Meteorology cancelled a severe thunderstorm warning for the southeast region late on Thursday night.
