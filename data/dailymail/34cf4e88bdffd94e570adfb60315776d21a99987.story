Four children were killed in a raging fire that broke out at a house in rural Manitoba, Canada, Wednesday night, despite their parents' desperate efforts to rescue them. 

The victims' mother was able to pull her three youngest children - two girls and a boy - to safety, but her older children became trapped in an upstairs bedroom and perished in the flames.

The young survivors of the blaze are currently staying with neighbors, as both their parents are in a hospital being treated for smoke inhalation.

Emergency response: Some 20 volunteer firefighters in four trucks responded to the scene after getting a call from the homeowner, but the flames were too intense for them to enter the burning structure 

Ravaged: The 90-year-old two-story wooden farmhouse burned to the ground, leaving four children dead  

The victims have been identified by Global News as 9-year-old Henry, 10-year-old Danny, 12-year-old Timmy and 15-year-old Bobby Froese.

The boys' mother, 34-year-old Doralee Eberhardt, was home when the fire broke out at around midnight. The woman's partner, Jake Froese, and her 18-year-old son were away at the time working a late shift.

Kane Fire Chief Bernanrd Schellenberg says the family's 90-year-old farmhouse in southern Manitoba was already engulfed in flames by the time volunteer crews got to the scene.

He says firefighters couldn't get inside because the flames were burning so hot and there was too much smoke.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police say the blaze broke out early Wednesday near the tiny community of Kane, about 60 miles southwest of Winnipeg, Manitoba.

When Jake Froese and his eldest son returned home after midnight and found it engulfed in flames, they called 911 and then attempted to reach the children trapped upstairs using a ladder, but by that time it was too late, according to a neighbor.

Some 20 volunteer firefighters in four trucks arrived at the remote farmhouse at around 2am, only to find the two-story wooden structure consumed by fire.

Neighbor Kristy Penner tells CBC.ca she found the couple's three youngest children crying inside a car next to their mother. their father was standing nearby, covered in soot.

Doralee Eberhardt and her partner are Mennonites. Some of their brood were home-schooled, while others attended local schools 

According to Environment Canada, the temperature in the area Wednesday night was just under -16 degree.

Ralph Groening, the reeve of the tight-knit rural community, tells the Toronto Star the youngest members of the family, including a one-year-old, slept on the ground floor of the home, while their older siblings were lodged upstairs.

The reeve said the family is Mennonite, and some of their children were home-schooled while others attended the tiny Lowe Farm and Rosenort schools.

Counseling services have been made available to the classmates of the four young victims and the firefighters who responded to the scene. 

The local community has rallied around the bereaved family since the tragedy, offering them financial help and a temporary place to stay.
