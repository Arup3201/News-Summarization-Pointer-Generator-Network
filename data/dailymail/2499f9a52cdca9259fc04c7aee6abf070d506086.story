Alex Song is refusing to rule out staying at West Ham beyond the end of the season. 

Sources close to the midfielder on a season-long loan from Barcelona say he is ‘very happy’ at the East London club and has settled quickly at Upton Park, where he is a firm fan favourite.

The 27-year-old is expected to be the target of a number of Champions League clubs, but Song is enjoying his time at West Ham and there remains ‘a chance’ he could stay for longer.

Sam Allardyce is hopeful he can persuade Song to stay but has to wait until the end of the season to find out.

The Cameroon international wants Champions League football next year but would prefer to remain in England instead of returning to Spain, where he struggled to hold down a regular place under Barcelona manager Luis Enrique.

West Ham currently sit third in the Barclays Premier League after beating Swansea City 3-1 on Sunday, with Song proving a key player in the heart of Allardyce's team again. 

The former Arsenal star was hailed by his manager after recovering from a knee injury to help beat 10-man Swansea for their third consecutive win, though striker Andy Carroll stole the headlines with two goals before Diafra Sakho scored the third.

The Hammers are currently in their highest Premier League position since September 1999, and are keen to keep Song with his Barcelona contract expiring this summer.

Song became West Ham's eighth summer signing after being linked with moves to Liverpool, Napoli and Galatasaray, following the arrivals of Mauro Zarate, Cheikhou Kouyate, Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho, Carl Jenkinson, Aaron Cresswell and Diego Poyet.
