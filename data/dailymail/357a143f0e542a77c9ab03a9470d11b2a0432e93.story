Guilty: Sam Hurd (pictured watching Chicago Bears teammates in 2011) has pleaded guilty to drug-possession

Former NFL wide receiver Sam Hurd pleaded guilty to drug-possession in court today, after being charged with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana.

The 27-year-old, who is facing significant jail time, sat in Dallas federal court and his trial is scheduled to begin on Monday.

Prosecutors allege Hurd was trying to obtain large amounts of cocaine and marijuana to build a drug-distribution network.

Hurd was arrested in December 2011 after allegedly accepting cocaine from an undercover officer at a Chicago-area steakhouse. At the time, Hurd was a player for the Chicago Bears.

Prosecutors alleged he told the officer 
and an informant at the steakhouse that he wanted to purchase up to 10 
kilograms of cocaine a week for $25,000 per kilogram.

Hurd played five seasons with the Dallas Cowboys before signing with the Bears in 2011. He was released after his arrest.

Hurd pleaded guilty to one count of possession of cocaine and marijuana with intent to distribute and a federal judge had refused his attorney's request to delay his trial.

Prosecutors and Hurd's attorneys have been in plea discussions for months, according to one of his attorneys, Jay Ethington.

One sticking point was what allegations Hurd would acknowledge in a plea agreement, which will factor into his recommended sentence on the indictment, Ethington said in September.

Intent to distribute: Hurd allegedly wanted to purchase up to 10kg of cocaine once a week for $25,000 per kilo

His arrest shocked his teammates in 2011 and led to his release from the Chicago Bears.

Months later, he was back in court after failing two drug tests and allegedly trying to arrange another drug buy.

Two men linked to Hurd's alleged attempts to buy drugs have pleaded guilty and were prepared to testify against him.

Hurd played college football at Northern Illinois and then five seasons with the Dallas Cowboys before signing a contract with the Bears in 2011 that was reportedly worth up to $5.15 million.
