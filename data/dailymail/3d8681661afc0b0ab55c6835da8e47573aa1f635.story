A new robot that can fly and mimic the movements of a beachside nuisance was presented to the world on Sunday.

At the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting in Pittsburgh, designers Leif Ristroph and Stephen Childress showed off the stunning creation, Science Codex reports. Both Ristroph and Childress are part of New York University's Courant Institute, according to a press release for their presentation 'Hovering of a jellyfish-like flying machine.'

Ristroph, Science Codex reports, said the main challenge of imitating flapping wings is that they are 'inherently unstable.' He cited fruit flies, noting that they constantly tweak their motions in response to the elements.

Amazingly, the tiny robot weighs a mere 2g and is 4 inches across, Discovery reports. Though it is not autonomous, Ristroph plans to build more robots that are able to fly entirely on their own.

The robot's wings 'squirt air' and give it momentum to lift off, allowing it to move like the jelly, NBC News reports. The wings are connected to a power source via a wire to allow for movement.

Ristroph said that his robot designs were 'sort of dumb' -- they stay afloat solely by using their wings.

'That's the beauty of the design,' told NBC News. 'It doesn't need a 'smart' design to help it recover.'

Explaining the benefits of his research project, Ristroph also told the network that they could be used to monitor air pollution and quality control.
