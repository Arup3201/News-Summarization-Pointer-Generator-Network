Most people probably can't remember the last time they used a payphone but they are about to come back into vogue as Wi-Fi hotspots.

The good old-fashioned phone box has been outdated by the ever-increasing demand for smart phones and mobile internet services.  

There were almost 40,000 phone booths in use in 2009, which had dropped by 10,000 last year,The Age reported.

But all is not lost for the once high-in-demand pay phone - as the one thing that made the boxes unpopular could what boosts its revival. 

Telstra has launched a trial of 1000 new Wi-Fi hotspots that will be switched on in November for the Christmas period in tourist locations across the country.

Some of the payphones will be converted into WiFi hotspots that will temporarily allow all users to access the internet using smartphones and tablets free of charge.

The sites launched on Tuesday include Sydney's Bondi Beach, Melbourne's Bourke Street Mall, Brisbane's Queen Street Mall and Perth's central business district. 

Customers wont be able to wander too far from the hotspots to get the Wi-Fi signal as the maximum range is between 30 and 50 metres.

The initiative forms part of the $100 million Wi-Fi hotspot network Telstra announced in May. 

The company will build 8000 of its own hotspots and also partner with retail stores and local governments to get two million hotspots around the country. 

After the trial period, the hotspots will only be free for Telstra fixed-line internet customers with others paying a fee to use it.

'Access to Wi-Fi will be free in the trial sites until the network officially launches early next year,' Telstra said in the statement.

'The new hotspots will allow [Australians] to browse the internet, check emails or upload photos to social media when they are sitting at a café, shopping in retail stores, or waiting for the bus, train or tram in range of a hotspot.'

WiFi hotspots are already available in New Zealand, New York City and London.
