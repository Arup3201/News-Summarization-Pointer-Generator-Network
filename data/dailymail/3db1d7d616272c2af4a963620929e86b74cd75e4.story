William Vogt, 56, of New Hampton, New York, allegedly posed as a millionaire and dubbed himself ‘Bill Bolland’  to scam an investor out of $350,000

A New York man has been charged with posing as an internationally renowned fashion mogul to con an investor out of $350,000 (£230,000).

Using the alias 'Bill Bolland', 56-year-old William Vogt pretended to be a millionaire with the company Bill Bolland Haute Couture, according to the Times Record-Harold.

Vogt, of New Hampton, New York, used the company to convince his victim to invest in ventures that did not exist from 2011 to 2014, the New York Attorney General’s office said on Tuesday. 

He promised the victim he would use the money to secure office space at the Heron Tower in Manhattan, attain seats on the board of directors of Voss Foundation and make political donations to Hillary Clinton, prosecutors alleged.

Vogt also told the investor he would buy health insurance and a retirement account, and obtain Swiss citizenship, the court heard.

The investor’s money was instead used to pay for rent and purchases via Paypal and to shop at Home Depot, Target and ShopRite, according to the Attorney General's office.

It also claimed Vogt created fictional emails from companies including Credit Suisse, Voss Foundation and Morgan Stanley to make his investments appear valid.

Authorities believe Vogt scammed several investors but he has only been charged for swindling the one victim, the Times Record-Herald said.

He pleaded not guilty at the New York County Supreme Court in Manhattan on Tuesday, according the New York Post.

He has been charged with two counts of second-degree grand larceny, four counts of third-degree grand larceny, nine counts of second-degree forgery and three counts of violating the Martin Act.

If convicted of the 18 felonies, he could face up to 15 years in prison.

Vogt was already in custody at the Ulster County Correctional facility for a parole violation when he was indicted on Tuesday.

He is being held on a $4million bond or $2million cash bail. 

In 1995 he had a run-in with the law when he was arrested and accused of posing as a designer named William ‘St Angelo’ Persico, the Times Record-Herald said, citing a 1995 article from the Register Harold.

He told people he wanted to build the largest perfume factory in the northeast.

Police said that at the time he went by the aliases Georgio Di St Angelo, Paul Bennett and Bill Bollen.

The New York Attorney General’s Office is investigating other high-end investment deals Vogt may have been a part of.

The trial is ongoing. 

Vogt pleaded not guilty to 18 felonies at the New York County Supreme Court in Manhattan on Tuesday
