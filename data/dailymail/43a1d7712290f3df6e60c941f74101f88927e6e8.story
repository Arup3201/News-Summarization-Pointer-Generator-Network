World Cup-winning coach and Sportsmail columnist Sir Clive Woodward runs his expert eye over England's 28-27 loss to New Zealand on Saturday and looks ahead to the next challenges facing Stuart Lancaster's side against the Crusaders on Tuesday and Saturday's third Test.

Ben Smith by some distance. Smith is a classic modern-day back-three player who can switch positions but on Saturday he was peerless at full-back and epitomises New Zealand rugby.

He’s comparatively lightweight but is quick, hugely skilful and has a wonderful rugby brain.

That try-saving tackle on Manu Tuilagi just before half-time when England were 10-3 up was  masterful. Many commentators criticised Tuilagi for not making more of a gilt-edged scoring chance.

Wrong, the praise should go to Smith.

Was their inner belief which says ‘if we produce our best game we can beat anybody’.

New Zealand can be a horribly difficult place to play but there has been no fear or inferiority complex and that is a big box to tick.

I like the way England conduct themselves on and off the field, they are clearly proud and inspired by the shirt and we can be proud of them.

I applaud the coaches for being willing to experiment with Tuilagi on the wing against the best team in the world and there need be no regrets over that decision. That did not cost them the Test match but there must be no backward step now. Do not think you can beat New Zealand by power alone. That is such old-school thinking, as the Smith tackle on Tuilagi showed.

Was England’s use of the bench which stemmed from the original selection.

Courtney Lawes, Dylan Hartley and Billy Vunipola should have started and because they didn’t a confused bench strategy resulted once again, taking off guys who were going well to replace them with first choices who then struggled to get into the game.

England’s execution was also poor on occasions. Billy Twelvetrees’ decision to offload to Tom Wood early in the second half was absolutely correct, it should have created a try, but the execution was poor. England were turned over and the All Blacks were away for a try.

The margins are very small at this level but let’s hope England keep faith with this approach.

Because their basic skill levels are still superior. It’s not instinctive or God-given, they work  constantly at the little things from an early age until those skills become second nature.

They understand better than any team in the world that talent alone is not enough. And then, when they go down the tunnel losing 10-6 at half-time against a good England team, they come out firing with 20 minutes of rugby that nobody can match.

Supreme skills enable you to play at another level under extreme pressure and New Zealand do that constantly.

Is for Stuart Lancaster to get his first team out against New Zealand on Saturday.

We still haven’t seen England start with their ‘Gun XV’ which, considering who they are playing and the importance of this tour, is a nonsense.

The first Test was arguably beyond his control, last Saturday’s selection was a compromise that didn’t work but as a parting shot let’s nail down our best team and throw the kitchen sink at the All Blacks.

Start with Hartley, Lawes and Vunipola, bring Tuilagi back to centre.

This is a huge week. Lancaster has 46 players down there now to manage and a big match against Canterbury on Tuesday, which is not easy. The tour must finish on a positive note.
