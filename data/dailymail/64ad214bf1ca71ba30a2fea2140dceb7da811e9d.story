Stoke

Midfielder Glenn Whelan is out and full-back Phil Bardsley doubtful for Stoke's Barclays Premier League clash at Southampton on Saturday.

Whelan fractured a leg during the Republic of Ireland's recent Euro 2016 qualifier against Germany and is sidelined for up to six weeks, whilst Bardsley will undergo a late fitness test for a back problem.

Centre-back Rob Huth and midfielder Marco Arnautovic, who both missed last weekend's 2-1 home win over Swansea through injury, come back into contention.

Provisional Squad: Begovic, Sorensen, Wilson, Shawcross, Huth, Pieters, Cameron, Bardsley, Muniesa, Nzonzi, Adam, Sidwell, Ireland, Walters, Arnautovic, Bojan, Assaidi, Moses, Crouch, Diouf.
