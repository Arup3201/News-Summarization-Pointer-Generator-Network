Leyton Orient manager Russell Slade has admitted he is 'proud' to be linked with the vacant managerial position at Cardiff City.

Slade has emerged as the surprise new favourite to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the Welsh club, jumping ahead of the likes of Dave Jones and Neil Lennon.

His odds with bookmakers fell from 33/1 to 1/3 last night after a flood of money was placed on his expected appointment.

Kike's goal proved the final straw for Solskjaer

Orient, conceding a goal to Notts County here, have had a poor start to the season themselves 

Slade said: 'It is nice to be associated with such a big club (Cardiff) like that.

'I'm very proud of the fact that they've seen the good work that we've done at Leyton Orient.

'I think they may have requested permission to talk to me.

'But I'm uncertain. I'm a little bit in the dark.' 

Slade was given one game to save his job at the start of the week and subsequently drew at Notts County. He is under pressure after a slow start to the season that has left Orient languishing in 19th place in League One. 

Tugay is said to be keen on replacing the Norwegian 

Dundee boss Paul Hartley was in the frame but has distanced himself from rumours 

Neil Lennon is another candidate to take over at the Welsh club 

The East London club lost on penalties in the play-off final last season and were expected to challenge for promotion this time around. 

Danny Gabbidon and Scott Young have been put in charge at Cardiff following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's departure and have been preparing the squad for an away trip to Derby County this weekend.

The Bluebirds' 1-0 loss at home to Middlesbrough on Tuesday night was the final straw for owner Vincent Tan. 

Defeat left Cardiff 17th in the Championship after relegation from the Premier League last season.
