A new report warning Americans of an imminent obesity epidemic  is predicting that by 2030 half the adult population will be morbidly overweight.

On Tuesday, the 
Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation released a study, based on statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), that forecasts a 44 percent rate of adult obesity in every state and a staggering 60 percent in 13 states.

Authors of the report, entitled 'F as in Fat', are urging the population to act now or face immeasurable economic and health-related consequences.

On the rise: A new report is forecasting that half the U.S. population will be obese by 2030 if we don't do something now to change our eating habits

The 'F as in Fat' 
report also highlights the current glum picture of the U.S. obesity 
epidemic, in which 35.7 percent of adults and 16.9 percent of children 
age 2 to 19 are obese according to CDC figures.

Obesity raises the 
risk of numerous diseases, from type 2 diabetes to endometrial cancer, 
meaning more sick people and higher medical costs in the future, the 
report said.

It projects as many
as 7.9million new cases of diabetes a year, compared with 1.9million 
new cases in recent years. There could also be 6.8million new cases of 
chronic heart disease and stroke every year, compared with 1.3million 
new cases a year now.

The increasing 
burden of illness will go right to the bottom line, adding $66billion 
in annual obesity-related medical costs over and above today's $147billion to $210billion. Total U.S. healthcare spending is estimated at 
$2.7trillion.

That projection 
supports a study published earlier this year in the American Journal of 
Preventive Medicine that found that by 2030, 42 percent of U.S. adults 
could be obese, adding $550billion to healthcare costs over that 
period.

As with all 
projections, from climate models to Charles Dickens' A Christmas 
Carol, human actions can prevent the worst of the scenarios, according 
to health policy experts.

The stats: Trust for America teamed up with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to project obesity rates nationwide based on statistics compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

'This is a tale of 
two futures,' said Jeffrey Levi of George Washington University and the 
executive director of Trust for America's Health. 'We're at a turning 
point where if we don't do something now to mitigate these trends, the 
cost in human health and healthcare spending will be enormous.'

Obesity is defined 
as having a body mass index (BMI) above 30. Overweight means a BMI of 25
to 29.9. BMI is calculated by taking weight in pounds and dividing it 
by the square of height in inches, and multiplying the result by 703. 
For instance, someone who is 5ft 5in tall and weighs 185lbs
(84 kg) has a BMI of 30.8.

Obesity rates
among U.S. adults have more than doubled from the 15 percent of 1980. 
In that same time, they have more than tripled among children.

Since the CDC found
that the percentage of obese children and adults was essentially 
unchanged between 2008 and 2010, some experts question whether the 'F as
in Fat' model overstates future obesity by assuming past trends 
continue in a straight line.

'This is a strong 
assumption,' said economist Justin Trogdon of RTI International in North
Carolina. 'Recent evidence from other surveys suggest obesity rates may be leveling off.'

Mathematician 
Martin Brown of Britain's National Heart Forum, a nonprofit group, who 
led development of the model, said it takes a longer view by design.

'You have to take 
trends over a number of years,' he said. 'In the age groups that matter,
there just isn't much evidence of a leveling off in obesity rates.'

'We're at a turning point where if we don't do something now to mitigate these trends, the cost in human health and healthcare spending will be enormous'

Obesity has long 
been associated with education and income. The report found that about 
one-third of adults without a high school diploma were obese, compared 
with about one-fifth of those who graduated from college or technical 
college.

And one-third of 
adults who earn less than $15,000 per year are obese, compared to 
one-quarter of those who earned $50,000 or more per year. The 
obesity-poverty connection reflects such facts that calorie-dense foods 
are cheap and that poor neighborhoods have fewer playgrounds, sidewalks 
and other amenities that encourage exercise.

As a result, many 
states projected to have the most obesity in 2030 do now, too. In 2011,12 states had an adult-obesity rate above 30 percent, with Mississippi 
the highest at 34.9 percent. Colorado was the lowest at 20.7 percent.

The report projects
that in 2030 in Mississippi, 66.7 percent of adults will be obese, as 
will 44.8 percent in Colorado, which will still be the thinnest state.

More surprising are
projections for states such as Delaware, now ranked 19 for obesity with
a rate of 28.8 percent. The model uses 1999 as a baseline, explained 
Brown. 'So if a state had a low rate of obesity in 1999 and is fairly 
high now, that indicates a steep rate of increase, which we believe will
not go away.' Result: an obesity rate of 64.7 percent in Delaware in 2030, making it the third-most obese state.

States facing the greatest percentage increase in obesity-related medical costs are now in the middle of the pack.

New Jersey faces the largest increase in costs, 34.5 percent, as its obesity rate
is projected to climb from 23.7 percent today to 48.6 percent in 2030. 
Eight other states could see increases of 20 percent and 30 percent, 
including New Hampshire, Colorado and Alaska.

Trust for America's Health sees room to change that trajectory with the right interventions.

'We have learned 
that with a concerted effort you can change the culture of a community, 
including its level of physical activity, eating habits, what foods are 
offered in schools, and whether families eat together,' said Levi.

In New York City, 
for instance, obesity for elementary and middle-school students dropped 
5.5 percent from the 2006-07 school year to 2010-11, thanks mostly to 
healthier school lunches, public health experts said.

'A lot of this is about making healthy choices easier and not mandating healthier lifestyles,' Levi said
