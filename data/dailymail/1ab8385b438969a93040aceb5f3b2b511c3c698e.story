A long journey across the Atlantic ocean to play a regular-season game in London not something that many NBA players experience, but it is a trip that Jason Kidd is getting very used to.

Kidd played at the O2 Arena two years ago when the New York Knicks beat the Detroit Pistons and then returned 12 months later as coach of a Brooklyn Nets team that was far too strong for the Atlanta Hawks.

On Thursday night, Kidd will once again return to the same building as coach of the Milwaukee Bucks as they face his former team the Knicks.

Coming to London in the middle of the season is a trip that Kidd enjoys, and his previous two experiences stand him in good stead to rack up a hat-trick of regular-season victories in England.

‘Wherever I’m at we get signed up for this game, Kidd laughed. ‘I love it and the last two years it has been great and I look forward to it again.

‘Being a player the first year, I understand the schedule that we had. I used it the following year for Brooklyn and I thought it helped us adjust to the time zone and also adjust to having practice when the time difference is big.

‘We will copy the same things we did last year and hopefully try and find a way to win.’

Since his move from Brooklyn in the summer, Kidd has created a young and exciting team in Milwaukee that travel to London with a winning 20-19 record and fifth place in the Eastern Conference.

When the contest against the Knicks in London was announced last year by the NBA, the Bucks were something of an unknown quantity and a mere supporting act to one of the league’s most popular teams.

But with the talent that Kidd has assembled in Milwaukee, along with the Knicks’ struggles this season, the Bucks are a team that are going places and they will be favourites to win on Thursday.

‘We can’t take anybody lightly, Kidd said. ‘There is nobody in this league that we can overlook. Derek (Fisher, New York Knicks head coach) is going to have his guys ready to play and they have got a lot of talent so we will definitely bring our A-game.

‘We are not built around one guy. Everyone plays. We have some very young talent, but when you look at the pieces we have with guys who play at a very high level, we are still the second youngest team in the league and we are fun to watch.

‘I wouldn’t want to be in no other place than with a young team being able to grow as a young coach so I’m in a perfect environment and love the city of Milwaukee – it’s been great.

‘This is a close team already so being able to do team functions and something different always gives the experience, win or lose, of understanding what we can learn from doing something that isn’t just the norm.

‘We always try and talk about the future but we have got to stay in the present and my job is to make these guys understand what it takes to win and what it means to play hard and also what it means to do your job to a very high level.’ 

Kidd is only in his second season as an NBA head coach after almost two decades as a player, but already he has been through a lot.

His start in Brooklyn last season wasn’t the best, but eventually he got his team in order for a play-off run before being traded to Milwaukee.

His opposite number at New York, Derek Fisher, is going through a similarly rough spell in his rookie season as a coach with the Knicks on a 15-game losing streak and holding a 5-35 record.

‘Coaching is different to playing,’ Kidd said. ‘It isn’t always going to start off great but this is a marathon and it is how you end. Coach Fisher is going through a tough time right now, but there is still a lot of basketball to be played and a lot of games to turnaround and they have the talent.' 

Kidd grew up in California and initially started playing football. Two years ago, the former Knicks point guard joined some of his team-mates in watching Chelsea play Southampton in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge the day before their game against the Pistons.

‘As a kid it was my first sport and it was great to see soccer become a little more popular here in the States,' Kidd said.

‘But it is great to see those athletes and what they do and the fans who sing songs. The enthusiasm of going to a game is incredible.’
