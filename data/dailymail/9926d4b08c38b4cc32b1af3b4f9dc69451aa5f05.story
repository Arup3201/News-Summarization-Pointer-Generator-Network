Phil Neville believes Manchester United can come good this season once they have got over their current injury crisis.

The Red Devils lie seventh in the Premier League  - eight points off the leaders Chelsea - but Neville says United should only be judged as a side when everyone is fit. 

Jonny Evans, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones are all sidelined through injury, with Louis van Gaal being forced to hand a senior debut to Paddy McNair against West Ham last week, due to the lack of defenders available to him.

Phil Neville made 386 appearances in all for Manchester United in 11 years at the club

 After leaving Manchester United, Neville moved to Everton, where he played for eight seasons

And Neville is under no illusions as to how big a role that has played in United's indifferent start to the season.

He told www.manutd.com: 'It's been a bit up and down for United. The biggest problem is the amount of injuries - to have nine or 10 out, particularly in key areas of the pitch, means you're always going to struggle.

'The time to judge this team is when everybody is fit. People are having a go at the defence but there have been no centre-backs fit all season. 

Neville was part of the coaching staff under the David Moyes and Ryan Giggs tenures at Manchester United last season but was not retained by Louis van Gaal

'Soon, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling will be back and the manager can start playing his best pairing at centre-back.

'I'm sure these players will come good. I've got every faith in them. I've coached them, played with and against them, and I know the qualities they have got.'

United entertain another of Neville's former teams Everton on Sunday, with the 37-year-old unsure how Roberto Martinez's side will fare at Old Trafford, on the back of a near 4,000 mile trip to Russia in mid-week owing to Europa League commitments.

He added: 'I think to come back from Russia and play on Sunday at 12 o'clock is really difficult, from past experience, so I feel United have got to have a fast start and keep the tempo high to make sure Everton feel the effects of the Europa League game.

'Everton have let in too many goals which is unlike them, and every goal has been an individual error. But it was their best defensive performance at Anfield [last weekend] when they cut out the silly mistakes and became hard to beat.'
