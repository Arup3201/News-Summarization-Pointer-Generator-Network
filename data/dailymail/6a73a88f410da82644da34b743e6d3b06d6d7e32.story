At first glance, you could be forgiven for thinking that a group of painters and decorators had left behind a pile of their paint-spattered dust-sheets.

In fact this collection of crumpled paper, suspended plastic bags and scattered chalk is the work of one of the four finalists in this year's annual Turner Prize competition.

The other artists' work includes enamel paintings of mundane scenes including a dog dirt bin and a rundown pub, shaky split-screen videos of tower blocks and a piece titled 'Do Words Have Voices' which features a battered and scratched wooden table.

What do you think of it so far? Martin Boyce's rubbish bin vying for a £25,000 prize

Controversial choice? Karla Black's 'More of Today' features plastic bags suspended from the ceiling of the impressive Newcastle art centre

The exhibition for the world's most controversial prize for modern art launches in Newcastle's Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art tomorrow.

This is the first time the  Turner Prize has been held at a non-Tate venue in its 27-year history.

But the displays are certain to generate the same amount of criticism about whether they deserve to be defined as art.

The prize is notorious for rows over the artistic merit of its exhibits - which have included an unmade bed, balls of elephant dung and a room with a light turning on and off.

This year's finalists are only slightly less controversial.

Karla Black's innovative approach to sculpture sees her suspending plastic bags from the ceilings of galleries and using small scrunched up balls of dough in her pieces.

Multiple angles: Black's works, on display at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Arts in Newcastle, can also be observed through sheets of glass splattered with paint

She selects things she 'cannot help 
but use' which include powder-paint, plaster, crushed chalk, Vaseline, 
lipstick, topsoil, sugar paper, balsa wood, eye shadow, nail varnish and
moisturiser.

Another 
Scot, Martin Boyce, has created atmospheric, angular sculptural 
installations which have philosophical names like 'Do The Words Have 
Voices.'

Hilary Lloyd uses still and moving images as well as sound to portray abstract urban environments.

She makes her technical equipment a part of her sculptures, clearly displaying the audio-visual tools.

Fellow nominee: Martin Boyce's philosophically named 'Do The Words Have Voices' is an atmospheric, angular sculpture and is on show in Newcastle

George
Shaw's 
naturalistic paintings of urban landscapes, council estates and 
abandoned houses are small in scale but give out a strong message.

He
paints the landscape of his adolescent life. Each scene exists 
within a half-mile radius of George's childhood home on the Tile Hill 
estate in Coventry.

The 
Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, located on the south bank of the 
River Tyne in Gateshead, has a world class modern art collection of its 
own - as well as offering almost unparalleled views over the city of 
Newcastle.

It is the UK's largest display space for 
contemporary art outside London, and was created from a derelict 
1940s grain warehouse as part of a drive - spearheaded by Gateshead 
council in the 1990s - for transformation through culture.

The Angel
of the North, the Sage Gateshead Music Centre and the Gateshead 
Millennium Bridge were all products of the same vision.

Baltic's role was to be an 'art 
factory' of international stature, with a constantly changing schedule 
of exhibitions and no permanent collection.

Opened in July 2002, it has received four million visitors and now has 400,000 annually.

Chief curator Sir Laurence Sillars 
said he expected to be inundated with visitors to the gallery, housed in
a former grain warehouse on the south bank of the River Tyne.

He
said: 'It is a great achievement for Gateshead and Baltic to be the 
first ones to present the Turner Prize outside the boundaries of the 
Tate in its history.

'There is a huge appetite for contemporary art here in the North East.

'Baltic itself gets about half a million visitors a year but this is a fantastic opportunity to see what is probably the most prestigious prize for contemporary art in the world.'

The Turner Prize has only once been held outside London, at the Tate in Liverpool in 2007.

Hosting the event would boost Baltic's profile and help engage the wider public, Sir Sillars said.

'It will mean an enormous amount to the area,' he added.

'The Turner Prize has become almost a household name and what a great celebration of some of the best art being produced in Britain.

'I think we will be inundated with visitors and I look forward to everybody entering the debate that surrounds the prize.'

Cameras at the ready: There is already a lot of interest in Turner Prize finalist George Shaw's naturalistic paintings of the urban landscape where he grew up

He said the north east's rough and ready reputation was undeserved and that the area was a hotbed for contemporary art.

He said: 'There are many artists living and working here and there are three strong art schools here.

'Baltic and a number of fellow organisations have been instrumental in keeping artists here.

'New art is being made here all the time.'

The exhibition opens to the public tomorrow.

The £25,000 winner will be announced live on Channel 4 on December 5.
