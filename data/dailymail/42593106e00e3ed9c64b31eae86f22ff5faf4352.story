Alex Rodriguez has sued Major League Baseball and its commissioner, saying they are trying to destroy his reputation and career.

Rodriguez took a swing for the fences and accused Major League Baseball and Commissioner Bud Selig of pursuing him in a 'witch hunt' designed to smear Rodriguez’ character and cost him tens of millions of dollars.The lawsuit was filed Thursday in New York State Supreme Court by lawyers for the Yankees third baseman.

It seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for what it alleges was a relentless campaign by the league and Selig to 'destroy the reputation and career of Alex Rodriguez.'

Lawsuit: Alex Rodriguez has sued Major League Baseball, accusing the league of engaging in 'tortious interference' in an effort to force him from the sport and potentially cost him tens of millions of dollars

Under fire: Alex Rodriguez has sued Major League Baseball and its commissioner, saying they are trying to destroy his reputation

  • Baseball is paying $5 million to Anthony Bosch, the proprietor of the now-defunct Biogenesis anti-aging clinic suspected to be a source of illegal PEDs to players, for his cooperation in its case against Rodriguez.• Baseball has repeatedly violated terms of a confidentiality agreement between the parties by leaking information damaging to Rodriguez to selected news outlets.• MLB investigators have bribed and intimidated witnesses, and on at least one occasion impersonated police officers.• Baseball attempted to buy Biogenesis records from Porter Fischer, a former Biogenesis employee, for $125,000, and that after Fischer reported the documents stolen, an MLB employee eventually bought them from an undisclosed source for $150,000 in cash that was 'handed off in a bag at a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., area restaurant.'

The suit claims Selig and MLB tried 
to smear Rodriguez’s reputation to 'gloss over' Selig’s past inaction 
and tacit approval of the use of performance-enhancing substances in 
baseball, which the lawsuit said had turned the 'Golden Age of Baseball'
into the 'Golden Age of Steroids.'

The lawsuit said Selig hoped to redeem himself and secure his legacy as the “savior” of America’s pastime.

Rodriguez is appealing a 211-game suspension for violating baseball's drug agreement and labor contract.

The
lawsuit says the suspension will cost him tens of millions of dollars 
in salary and could prevent him from meeting certain performance goals 
in his contract worth millions of dollars.

'Taking down Mr. Rodriguez would vividly demonstrate that Commissioner 
Selig had learned from the errors of his previous explicit or tacit 
tolerance of steroid use,' the lawsuit said.

MLB spokesman Matthew Monte says the league has no comment.

Appeal: Rodriguez is appealing the 211-game suspension levied against him in August by MLB for his alleged involvement with Bosch and Biogenesis

Defiant to the end: Mr Rodriguez blasted the Yankees and MLB during a minor league rehab assignment in August, saying they were conspiring to keep him off the field

The lawsuit was filed as Rodriguez 
appeals a 211-game suspension for violating baseball’s drug agreement 
and labor contract.

The suspension stemmed from baseball’s investigation
of the Biogenesis of America anti-aging clinic.

The suit accuses
the league and Selig of planting negative stories about Rodriguez in 
the news and trying to muddy his name while protecting a witness under 
investigation for allegedly providing steroids to minors.

'Such 
are the lengths that Commissioner Selig and MLB have stooped to in their
witch hunt against Mr. Rodriguez — paying and protecting someone under 
investigation for providing steroids to minors,' the lawsuit said.

The
court papers noted that Rodriguez’s suspension was four times the 
length of the other 13 players suspended in connection with the 
Biogenesis probe and the longest non-lifetime ban in baseball history.

They said the suspension was also 161 games longer than the 50-game 
suspension contemplated by the Joint Drug Agreement in the players’ 
contract.

The lawsuit said the suspension will cost Rodriguez 
tens of millions of dollars in salary and could prevent him from meeting
certain performance goals in his contract that are worth millions of 
dollars.

It also said two potential sponsors — Nike Inc. and 
Toyota Motor Corp. — have terminated negotiations with Rodriguez for 
potential sponsorship contracts and Rodriguez’s voice work as a hero for
an animated movie, 'Henry & Me,' has been cut.

The movie chronicles
the Yankees’ history and features baseball stars, past and present.

Questions remain: The suit does not address whether Rodriguez used banned substances

Worked his way back: Despite all the forces working against him - age, rehabilitation after a second hip surgery, a looming ban - A-Rod worked his way back to the Majors after a successful Minor League rehab

Mr Rodriguez was suspended for his involvement with the now-closed Biogenesis of America clinic in Coral Gables, Florida. The 13 other players penalized accepted their suspensions, which included a 65-game ban for Mr Braun and 50-game penalties for the others.

MLB said Mr Rodriguez's was suspended under baseball's joint drug agreement 'based on his use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including testosterone and human growth hormone over the course of multiple years.'

He also was disciplined under the collective bargaining agreement 'for attempting to cover up his violations of the program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the office of the commissioner's investigation.'

Mr Rodriguez is being treated as a first offender under the drug program, which means any suspension doesn't start unless upheld by an arbitrator.

Following hip surgery in January and a leg injury sustained during a minor league rehabilitation assignment in July, Mr Rodriguez returned to the Yankees on the day he was suspended. The 38-year-old hit .244 with seven homers and 19 RBIs in 44 games.

'I'm really looking forward to at least one full off season of hardcore training,' said the oft-injured third baseman. 'I haven't had that in quite a long time - then come back in tremendous shape and help this team win. This team has a lot of things to do over the winter. Obviously my situation is going to play a big part in it.'

A-Rod and New York squawked at each other in the summer, with Mr Rodriguez maintaining the Yankees were trying to keep him from returning. The team denied the accusation.

He is owed $86 million by the Yankees over the last four seasons of his record $275 million, 10-year contract. If he is suspended for the bulk of next season, the team has a chance to get under the luxury tax threshold of $189 million.
