Anthony Weiner has been lambasted as a ‘snake and a pervert’ who took advantage of a ‘mixed up kid,’ by the family of the 23-year-old at the heart of his latest sexting scandal.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, the close family member said: ‘This guy has used and taken advantage of Syd.

‘He’s a grown man. She’s a young girl and kind of a mixed up kid. She’s bright and she’s pretty but she’s got sucked up in this whole ugly thing and this guy’s a snake and a pervert.’

Stepping out: Sydney Leathers was seen grabbing 
coffee in Los Angeles, California on Thursday - the first time she has 
stepped out since revealing her online affair with Anthony Weiner earlier this 
week

The family member who asked not to be
 named said: ‘Sydney told her mom she was in some sort of relationship 
with this guy just a few months ago.

'She said he was ''deeply flawed'' and that he had made her promises he hadn’t kept.'''

According
 to the relative Sydney’s mother, Laura Leathers, tried to talk her 
daughter out of the relationship when she heard of it -  though none 
truly imagined the nature or extent of communications between the 
mayoral candidate and the political blogger raised in Mount Carmel, 
Illinois.

He said: ‘The 
first I heard of it was a call from Sydney’s mom the day it all came 
out. She just said, ''Google Sydney. You won’t believe what she’s done 
now.'''

‘Her mom knew there was something going on but none of us could have guessed this.

'Sydney told her mom that she wanted 
to get something more political out of it but she was frustrated because
 he wanted to go more down the sexual route.'

The
 relative did not know what lay behind a change in Sydney’s feelings but
 said that recently Sydney, who had always been a vocal supporter of 
Weiner, had expressed the view that he should not be elected.

As
 soon as the story broke and Sydney’s identity had been revealed, she 
had been signed up by an attorney and agent and was on a flight out of 
her Indiana home of Princeton to LA.

She
 called her mother this morning to say she had landed safely on the West
 Coast where MailOnline understands she has signed to appear on a major 
talk show.

Sydney, who had 
been living with her father in a small apartment in Princeton, was 
according to friends hungry for fame and fortune.

One has claimed that she boasted of wanting to make $100,000 and claimed that she could ‘ruin someone’s life right now'.

But according to her family member, 
it is her mother’s life who she has come closest to ruining right now: 
‘Her mom is just devastated and so embarrassed and hurt by this.

‘You can’t control your kids, not everything they do, but this is a real blow.

‘It was a blow when Syd dropped out of high school. She was bright. She could have gone to college. And now this?’

Sydney
 initially lived with her mother following her parents’ divorce but 
moved in with her father, James who works in Walmart, when her mother 
‘pushed her to go to school’ and she just didn’t want to.

In that same year, 2008, she was convicted on the criminal charge of possessing marijuana.

‘There was a lot in Sydney’s life we knew about but didn’t really like,’ the relative said. ‘But she’s basically a good kid and it just blows my mind that Weiner is still running. It’s him we blame.

‘He’s married and he has a baby and he’s already been in trouble. Everybody makes mistakes but come on!

‘Syd’s a very emotional kid. What kid wouldn’t’ be sucked in by who he is? But to see him stand up on television and make his wife stand by his side and tell the nation that she forgave him and she loved him…What sort of man does that?’
