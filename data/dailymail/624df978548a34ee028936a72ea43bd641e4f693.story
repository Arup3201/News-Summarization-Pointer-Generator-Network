Ed Miliband will today tell voters he needs a decade in Downing Street as he puts the NHS, home ownership and higher taxes on the rich at the heart of Labour’s bid for power.

The Labour leader will use his annual party conference address to set out his ‘ten-year plan’ for what he will call a ‘national mission’.

He will claim that a new mansion tax on expensive homes would raise almost £2billion a year, which could then be ploughed into the health service along with £1billion from other tax rises.

The Labour leader will restate his plans to reintroduce the 50p tax rate for higher earners

Mr Miliband will also restate his determination to reintroduce a 50p top rate of income tax if he wins the General Election in eight months’ time.

And he will make an audacious attempt to steal Margaret Thatcher’s vision of Britain as a property-owning democracy, setting a target to double the number of first-time buyers to 400,000 a year by 2025.

The party says it will increase the number of homes being built to at least 200,000 a year by the end of the next parliament – although aides conceded that some would have to be built on greenfield sites.

‘That most British of dreams, the dream of home ownership, has faded,’ the Labour leader will say, adding: ‘Housing will be a top priority in our capital investment programme – because we need to start Britain building again.’

However, the most eye-catching announcement is expected to be billions of pounds more for the National Health Service. 

Labour’s proposed Mansion Tax would be imposed on properties worth more than £2million. The money raised used to be earmarked for the cost of reintroducing the 10p tax rate to help low earners.

But yesterday shadow chancellor Ed Balls announced the 10p rate could be paid for by abolishing the married tax allowance, freeing up revenue from the Mansion Tax for other spending.

Labour would introduce ‘bands’, similar to those used for council tax, with a higher charge on houses worth more than £10million.

Mr Balls has insisted people trapped in expensive homes who have no access to savings will be protected from the charge.

There is expected to be protection for people who do not have large savings or higher earnings, but who live in an expensive home.

This is likely to apply to widows or families who have lived in the same property for many years.

A ‘relief scheme’ which could include allowing those on modest incomes to defer payment until the property is sold.

The mansion tax will also be ratcheted up on the most expensive properties, so the wealthiest pay most. 

Mr Miliband’s aspiration to increase home ownership is one of six ‘goals’ he would aim to achieve if he could have ten years in power. 

His plan to turn around Britain would also see Labour attempt to boost the number of apprenticeships to match the number of people going to university.

Large businesses hiring foreign workers from outside the EU would be forced to take on young people as apprentices, as would every firm winning Whitehall contracts.

Mr Miliband wants wages to grow at the same rate as the economy, he aims to halve the number of low-paid workers by 2025 and create a million ‘green’ jobs in environmentally-friendly industries over a decade.

Something to smile about? Mr Miliband will set out to plans to build thousands of more homes and set a target of 400,000 new first-time buyers every year by 2025

1. GIVING ALL YOUNG PEOPLE A SHOT IN LIFE

Ensure as many school-leavers go on to apprenticeships as go to university.

2. TACKLING THE COST-OF-LIVING CRISIS

Help working families share fairly in the wealth of our country so, when the economy grows, the wages of everyday working people grow at the same rate.

3. RESTORING THE DREAM OF HOME OWNERSHIP

Meet demand for new homes for the first time in half a century – doubling the number of first-time buyers getting on to the housing ladder a year.

4. TACKLING LOW WAGES

Halve the number of people on low pay in our country, changing the lives of over two million people.

5. SECURING THE FUTURE

Create one million more high-tech jobs by securing the UK’s position as a world leader in green industries.

6. SAVING OUR NHS

Build a world-class, 21st century health and care service.

With polls suggesting the Conservatives have extended their lead over Labour on the economy to 25 points, the widest margin since the days of Neil Kinnock, Mr Miliband will appeal to the country to ‘raise its sights’ beyond the need for further austerity, saying: ‘Can anyone build a better future for the working people of Britain? That is the General Election question.’

He will tell activists at the Manchester conference that people in Scotland voted for independence because they felt there was ‘nothing left to lose’, adding: ‘Our task is to restore people’s faith in the future. But the way to do it is not to break up our country. It is to break with the old way of doing things.’

He will go on to say: ‘I’m not talking about changing a policy, or a different programme. But something bigger: transforming the idea, the ethic, of how our country is run.

‘What people are saying is this country doesn’t care about me. Politics doesn’t listen. The economy doesn’t work. And they are not wrong. They are right. But this Labour Party has a plan to put it right.

‘For Labour, this election is about you. You have made the sacrifices, you have taken home lower wages year after year, you have paid higher taxes, you have seen your energy bills rise, you have seen your NHS decline, you know this country doesn’t work for you. We can build that better future for you and your family, wherever you live in the United Kingdom, and this speech is about Labour’s plan to do it: Labour’s plan for Britain’s future.’

However Conservative sources said Mr Miliband’s ‘six-point plan’ was Labour’s seventh such effort in the last three years. And Mark Littlewood, head of think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘Introducing a mansion tax would be poorly targeted, arbitrary and deeply unfair. A person’s assets do not always equate to their income.

‘Evidence has also proven that their favoured 50p top rate of income tax raises trivial amounts of money. Pouring extra money into the NHS, at the expense of those who already contribute a great deal is not the solution to the failings of our health system.’

Labour would abolish the Government’s flagship migration target if it wins power next year, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said last night. 

Miss Cooper said the target would be replaced by ‘different controls’ to distinguish between asylum seekers, low-skilled workers and students.
