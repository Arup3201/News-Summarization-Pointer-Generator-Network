No confidence: Headteachers have criticised Education Secretary Michael Gove's policies

Michael Gove today faced the wrath of headteachers over the state of the education system, just hours after they passed a landmark vote of no confidence in the Government's school reforms.

The Education Secretary was greeted with the most hostile reception he has faced during his time in office as members of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) warned that they are under intense stress amid major changes to education and the threat of Ofsted inspections.

Mr Gove was heckled as he told the NAHT's conference in Birmingham that they would 'part company' over concerns about Ofsted, and was jeered by delegates when he suggested that no school would be marked down in national curriculum tests because one child was off sick.

Union president Bernadette Hunter told Mr Gove children and their teachers had 'never had it so bad' and described him as a 'fanatical personal trainer' forcing 
schools to keep jumping through hoops without realising 'the damage he 
is causing to the body or the system'.

As she introduced Gove to the conference for a question and answer session, she said: 'You cannot fail to be aware that the morale of the profession is at an all time low. Many are angry at what is happening to the education system.

'Some school leaders are taking early retirement, while others do not want to take on headships because of the pressure.

'Those of us in education, leaders and learners, have never had it so bad. It is within your power to put this right.'

Mr Gove clashed repeatedly with delegates during the hour-long debate.

Denise Wells, head of Field House Infant School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire said: 'The culture we've got at the moment is one of bullying and fear, you ask why headteachers are going down with stress.

'It is because they are spending Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday waiting for Ofsted, not because they are not doing well, but because it (the outcome) depends on the people that come.

'It's because we're working in a culture of fear, not one of working together.'

Mr Gove told the conference: 'If Ofsted causes you stress, then I'm grateful for your candour, but we are going to have to part company.'

One delegate responded with 'Are you leaving them?'

In a robust defence, Mr Gove went on to say: 'What I have heard is repeated statements that the profession faces stress, and insufficient evidence about what can be done about it.'

He added: 'What I haven't heard over the last hour is a determination to be constructive, critical yes, but not constructive.'

Delegates suggested he was the cause of headteachers' stress and groaned when he responded: 'If people find it stressful that I'm demanding higher standards, then I'm not going to stop demanding higher standards.'

During the morning's session the union overwhelmingly passed a vote of no confidence in the Government's education policies.

Many of Mr Gove's reforms are "not in the best interests of children", it said.

Heads raised particular concerns about the new national curriculum, major test and exam reform and schools being forced into becoming academies.

Tim Gallagher, proposing the motion, said: 'Enough is enough. This motion's intention is to send the strongest message possible to this government that many of their education policies are failing our children, their parents and the very fabric of our school communities.'

The NAHT is the first union of headteachers to pass a vote of no confidence in the Government's education reforms.

The UK's three biggest teachers' unions, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and the NASUWT passed similar votes at their Easter conferences.

The NUT and the NASUWT are planning regional strikes in the North West next month in a continuing row over pay, pensions and workload with the prospect of a national walkout looming in the autumn.

The latest vote of no confidence is a further sign of the worsening relations between the Government and the teaching profession.

Mr Gallagher, a consultant headteacher from Worcestershire said that many of the government's education policies were 'ill-thought-through, not based on empirical evidence and devoid of meaningful consultation and lacking in understanding.'

He also suggested that ministers are attempting to push reforms through in a way that is 'disruptive, damaging and pernicious'.

'With this government it is ideology gone mad,' Mr Gallagher told the conference.

Vince
Burke, senior vice principal of All Saints Church of England Academy in
Plymouth suggested that the government is trying to reform too much of 
the education system at once.

'If
the Secretary of State had a business plan he would know that to be 
successful you don't change everything at the same time.'

Ministers are currently attempting to overhaul the curriculum, assessment, accountability and funding, he said.

The
resolution called on the NAHT's executive to ensure that the government
is left in no doubt that that the union represents the 'serious 
concerns' of the profession.

It was passed with 99.3 per cent of the vote.

Delegates also passed a second resolution raising concerns that 'too much power is currently given to one person to determine national policy on the basis of personal preference and ideologically-driven assumption.'

Steve Kirkpatrick a deputy headteacher and member of the NAHT's executive said that he had two children and was concerned about their education.

He said. 'This is so important because I want to stop people playing political ping pong with my children's education.'

The NAHT represents around 85 per cent of primary headteachers and 40 per cent of secondary leaders in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Heckled: The Education Secretary did not get a warm welcome from the conference audience

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We need to raise standards so we have an education system that is on a par with the world's best.

'Our academies programme is turning around hundreds of underperforming schools, we are introducing a world class curriculum and our reforms to exams will create qualifications that will keep pace with the demands of universities and employers. Surely this is something the NAHT should be supporting.

'We will not stand by when schools are failing our children. Sponsored academies are turning around hundreds of underperforming schools and ensuring pupils are given every chance to fulfil their potential.

'We are also overhauling special educational needs provision to put young people and their families at its centre, with more say in where they study and more control over the support they receive.'

Mr Gove told the conference that he is 'always happy to debate, discuss, hear about and engage with the profession about what their concerns are'.
