The discovery of skeletal remains believed to be a missing 16-year-old girl from Oklahoma was followed Tuesday by the arrest of a teenager in connection to her suspected death.

Tucker Ryan McGee, 19, was taken into custody this afternoon on a first-degree murder complaint following interviews conducted by Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics agents.

McGee's arrest came just hours after law enforcement officials acting on a tip discovered a human skull in a remote area north of the Weatherford airport in Custer County, Oklahoma.

Search effort: JaRay's family and friends set up several Facebook pages to post updates and spread information about the progress of the case

Officials suspect that the remains may be those of JaRay Wilson, 16, who went missing October 15, 2012, the station KFOR-TV reported.

The medical examinerâ€™s office will analyze the skeletal remains to determine the victimâ€™s identity and the cause of death.

A source told The Oklahoman that the young girl, a resident of Weatherford, was shot in the head before being dumped off a county road not far from her family home. 

Mark Woodward, a spokesman for the OBN, said McGee was questioned and sent to the Custer County jail.

Records show that the 19-year-old, who was Facebook friends with Wilson, pleaded guilty to a drug charge in March and was put on unsupervised probation.

According to investigators, JaRay's death may have been related to drugs of human trafficking, and they said more arrests are possible.

The missing girl's mother, Jara Wilson, told the paper that she received a phone call from investigators about the grisly find, but agents have not revealed anything beyond the possibility that the skull could be that of her daughter.

JaRay's friend Colton Kardokus told News9 that the 16-year-old had a great spirit and knew how to make those around her smile.
