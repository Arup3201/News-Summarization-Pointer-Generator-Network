When Danny Welbeck steps out to make his Arsenal debut, he will hope to have more luck than the last two players to wear the No 23.

For Nicklas Bendtner and Andrey Arshavin were last seen displaying the number on the back of their shirts for the Gunners, with any source of joy drowned out by a lack of effort and ineptitude.

Welbeck inherits the number after a £16m deadline day swoop to the Emirates Stadium from Manchester United.

Got your number: Danny Welbeck is the new No 23 at Arsenal after his £16m move from Manchester United

But who else? Andrey Arshavin signed for Arsenal from Zenit St Petersburg in January 2009

Next up: Nicklas Bendtner wore the No 23 shirt last season after several loan spells away from the club

Before Arshavin arrived in England in a similar beat-the-clock deal, the shirt had actually been worn by some club legends.

Sol Campbell and Ray Parlour to name a few, and early on the Russian's career (circa Jan 2009) looked to be heading down a similar path.

A solo strike against Blackburn was followed by an incredible four goals at Anfield at Liverpool. Fans were sure the best player of Euro 2008 would maintain his form in the Premier League.

But after a solid first full season at the club, performance levels dropped. As did the work-rate. The playmaker was later moved on to Zenit St Petersburg, on loan, and then on a free.

Varied success: At first Arshavin looked like a star at the Emirates Stadium

Not so much: A talented youngster, the No 23 shirt didn't do much for Bendtner in North London

Having started his Gunners career successful as a youngster as No 26, the move to No 52 (rumoured to be his wage packet) for Bendtner was an odd one. The Danish striker claimed the number was 'personal' to him. He even refunded fans who bought a shirt with his previous digits on.

No such explanation was given about his No 23, which he acquired after loan moves at Sunderland and (unsuccessfully) at Juventus.

Wenger begrudgingly welcomed Bendtner back into his squad and while he looked thoroughly off the pace. Lazy, a liability at times, but he was of course not devoid of confidence. Two goals in the Premier League last season, one of those in the last minute against Cardiff, helped Arsenal finish in the top four.

Of course Nicklas is gone now, and probably forgotten. It's now time for Welbeck to put smiles back on the fans' faces in that No 23 jersey.
