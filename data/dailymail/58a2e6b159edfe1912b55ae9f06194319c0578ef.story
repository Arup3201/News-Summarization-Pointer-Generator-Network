A man obsessed with Katie Price is undergoing cosmetic surgery in his quest to look just like his glamour queen idol.

Nathan Thursfield, 20, has a 'major fascination' with the Brighton-born star and was so desperate to emulate her that he decided to start copying her features - starting with her nose.

The cash supervisor from Stoke-on-Trent, told MailOnline that he first bonded with Katie, 36, when he met her at her book signing and the pair compared fake tans.

Nathan, pictured with the star before his nose job, even tweeted Katie, with whom he's become friends with, to show her the results. 'She thinks I'm mad,' he laughed

Nathan hated the way he looked and felt like his nose was too big, left, so he had a loan-funded surgery to make it look like Katie Price's 'dead petite and gorgeous nose' - after the operation pictured right

Earlier this year he underwent his first operation - taking out a loan to fund the surgery, which cost £6,500 - to have his nose reconstructed to look like her and even took a photo of her into the consultation with him.

However, Nathan admits he wants another nose job - and is planning on getting a bottom lift, which costs around £4,300, in September to emulate Katie's 'peachy' derriere and in May, he wants veneers so his teeth look like hers. He also got his eyebrows tattooed on to replicate her 'proper amazing' ones.

He said: 'I love Katie Price, I am fascinated by her and she's so gorgeous and down-to-earth. I love her ballsy attitude and her looks and where they've got her.

'Ever since I saw her in real life at her book signing a few years ago, I wanted to do what she does.' 

Nathan, whose boyfriend of five years supports his decisions, hated his appearance and felt like his nose was too big so he decided to do something about it - and looked to his idol for inspiration.

He said: 'I was so uncomfortable with my nose, I felt it wasn't suited to my face and that everyone was staring at it. Katie's is dead petite and gorgeous, it's just perfect.'

'The surgeon thought I was joking when I told him what I wanted and he said the nose would be girly but I didn't care. I just told him not to make me look like Michael Jackson,' Nathan said.

Nathan was desperate to rip-off the cast and check out his new nose as soon as he woke up, quickly rushing to compare pictures of his new nose with Katie's.

'It's not exactly the same,'  Nathan said. 'That's why I am having another £5,500 procedure in three weeks to make it exactly the same, it has to be right.'

Nathan does, however, say that the procedure has changed his life for the better. 

The youngster never used to go out before he had it done because he was so self-conscious, now he goes out partying and on holidays with friends.

'It has completely changed everything,' he said. 'I have never felt so confident, I used to hate meeting people and now I love it.'

Nathan even tweeted Katie, with whom he's become friends, to show her the results. 'She thinks I'm mad,' he laughed.

But Nathan, who even gets invited backstage to meet Katie at her public appearances, said he will continue with the procedures to look like his idol.

'I will just keep getting whatever she has,' says Nathan, who got a loan to fund his procedure at MYA Cosmetic Surgery.

While some of his friends and family think he's crazy and question why he wants to look like her, his boyfriend supports him.

'He just goes with the flow now, if I am happy then he is,' he added.
