Having your phone stolen while you try and enjoy a holiday is bad enough.

But for one victim of phone theft, she has also had to cope with receiving regular pictures of the man now using the handset.

Posing for extraordinary selfies and relaxing with friends, these hilarious pictures show the man around various locations in Dubai.

Funny: A girl who had her phone stolen while on holiday is able to see all of the photographs taken by the man who now has it - every time he takes a picture with her phone they upload onto her computer. This is Hafid, the man who has the girl's phone

Silly: One of the earliest pics posted by Hafid was this one of him on a beach in Dubai - with the burj khalifa, the tallest building in the world, in the background

Curious: Hafid clearly enjoys visiting new locations and getting friends to take pictures of him

The pictures were taken from a smartphone which was stolen from a beach
in Ibiza. The man who now has the phone has used it to take dozens of pictures of himself - 
completely unaware that every single one is automatically uploaded onto the owner's computer.

The unnamed girl has now started a blog in which she uploads every picture the man takes, with hilarious results.

Pictures show the man - called Hafid - posing in various locations around Dubai, often taking extraordinary selfies of himself.

One picture shows him posing on a beach beside the tallest building in the world while another has him in front of a mosque with friends. There is no evidence to suggest that Hafid stole the phone or knows that the phone is stolen.

The girl managed to find out Hafid's name when he entered her Facebook account using her phone and sent her a personal message from his own account.

Writing on her blog, the girl said she was on a beach in Ibiza with four friends when her phone was taken.

She wrote: 'We found ourselves hopelessly drunk and naked in the sea. We put our stuff on a deck chair 10m away.

Poser: Hafid clearly likes this car and decided to have his picture taken next to it

Happy: Hafid relaxes with a pot of tea

Chilled: Sat on a piece of grass, Hafid appears relaxed, completely unaware that his pictures are being sent to the phone's owner

'When I ran back to the deck chair to get rid of my underpants, I noticed someone lying stiffly under the chair, not moving, not reacting.'

After thinking that it was her friend, she went back to swimming with her friends in the sea. However, she later realised it was not her friend but the phone thief, who proceeded to steal all of their belongings.'We tumbled out of the water quite irritated. Everything was gone. Money, purses, smartphones, passports, birthday presents and clothes.

'Back at the reception, wet, drunk and 
still semi-nude, the receptionist refused to help us, he said this 
happened like every day and nobody cared anymore.

Selfie time: Hafid clearly enjoys looking at himself, as these pictures demonstrate

Hafid poses with two friends outside a mosque. The girl's phone was taken while she swam in a beach in Ibiza

Playful: Through the pictures, Hafid manages to show that he does have a sense of humour

'Apparently some guys with night-vision glasses hid in the dunes, waiting for drunk tourists to leave their belongings somewhere unobserved. Then they crawled through the sand, stole the stuff and walked away like nothing happened.'

It was four months after the holiday that the girl turned on her computer and noticed fifteen new pictures inside her camera upload folder.

Every time a photograph is taken on her smartphone , it is automatically uploaded onto her computer.

Other photographs taken by Hafid show the inside of his apartment and pictures of his friends as well as images of food which he has just eaten.
