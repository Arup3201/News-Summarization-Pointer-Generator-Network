Thousands of seriously ill cancer patients could be denied treatment under changes to the way drugs are funded on the NHS.

Campaigners are warning that proposals from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) will end the priority given to terminally ill patients.

They estimate almost 13,000 cancer patients a year who are given life-prolonging drugs might be denied them under the new plans – with the elderly particularly vulnerable. They are urging the Government to tell Nice to approve more treatments, as has been done in Scotland.

Nice, which decides whether new medicines are cost-effective, is changing the criteria used to determine the value to patients and society of approving drugs.

Its appraisal committees will have to adopt a more ‘favourable approach’ when considering treatments for people whose conditions involve a ‘high burden’ of illness and where there is a wider impact on society.

But the decision to remove ‘end of life’ criteria, which gave special consideration to the seriously ill, has raised widespread concern.

Campaigners fear the change could lead to a ‘stealth cut’ in the cost threshold for approval, and the downgrading of treatment for those nearing the end of their lives.

Five years ago Nice issued new guidance to allow some dying cancer patients to get costly life-extending drugs on the NHS.

The new end-of-life criteria meant drugs formerly regarded as too expensive were more likely to be approved if they could extend life – usually by at least three months.

Advisory bodies were told they had to ‘fully consider’ all the benefits to affected patients.

The issue was raised following public criticism of Nice’s refusal to fund certain drugs for patients with terminal cancer.

It came to a head in 2008,  when the watchdog issued draft advice banning patients with advanced kidney cancer from receiving four life-prolonging drugs available in most other Western countries.

The drug Sutent, along with 11 others, has now been approved under the current criteria.

Nearly 13,000 patients a year are benefiting from the guidelines.

But campaigners claim the removal of end-of-life criteria means there is no certainty that life-extending drugs would continue to be funded.

Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the Rarer Cancers Foundation, said the proposed reforms would be a ‘backward step for cancer’.

He added: ‘Plans to abolish special rules for drugs used near the end of a patient’s life have been slipped out in the small print of this consultation.

‘They amount to a stealth cut for cancer and could have a devastating impact on access to life-extending drugs, with no guarantee that other changes to the rationing formula  will compensate.’

The reforms mark a shift to a system of value-based pricing that the Coalition Government pledged would allow patients to ‘access the drugs and treatments their doctors think they need’.

Nice proposes a new ‘burden of illness’ criteria, described as the loss in quality and length of life, to replace the current end-of-life protocol. It says other factors such as wider social  impact, whether a new technology or drug is innovative, and non-health objectives such as reducing the impact on carers, will be taken  into account.

It will do this by measuring the burden of a disease in ‘quality adjusted life years’, and comparing this with the years that people could expect to live without the condition.

Experts say this could discriminate against the elderly, as they have fewer years of life left.

Societal impact would look at a person’s capacity to engage with society as a result of living with the disease.

Leading prostate cancer specialist Professor Jonathan Waxman said: ‘Nice is a monstrous and Kafkaesque bureaucracy that is unanswerable to the public and their doctors.

‘It grows from strength to strength and costs millions and millions of pounds more to run, money that could be usefully spent on the treatment of patients.’

Ben Osborn, Head of Pfizer Oncology UK, said ‘English and Welsh patients are being denied innovative new medicines that improve and extend lives. 

‘We fear these proposals could be yet another sticking plaster solution that won’t solve that problem.

‘Government must help Nice by setting a new mandate that frees it to champion innovation for the benefit of patients.

‘Failing to act will create a two-tier health system, where patients in England are denied treatments available elsewhere in the UK.’

Ahead of publication of the draft proposals, Nice said it would not discriminate against the elderly simply because they had had a ‘fair innings’.

But a spokesman said it was ‘difficult to say with certainty’ whether the changes would lead to more treatments being approved.

Clive Stone with David Cameron during 2012's Olympic relay: The 66-year-old was fought Nice because it refused to approve the new drug Sutent

When grandfather Clive Stone was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2007, he never dreamed he would spend the rest of his life fighting for the rights of patients.

The former bank manager, 66, was plunged into a battle with Nice because it refused to approve the new drug Sutent.

The drug rationing watchdog said it was too expensive, even though it had been shown to double survival time to 28 months.

Eventually the drug was approved under end-of-life criteria, meaning people with the most severe health needs get priority.

But under the proposed changes, there is no certainty that Sutent would be available on the NHS.

Mr Stone, who lives near Witney, Oxfordshire, said: ‘If I hadn’t got Sutent I wouldn’t be here today, almost seven years later.

‘Those of us who campaigned, and are still campaigning, against the appalling process cancer patents have to go through to get vital drugs will carry on. 

‘If restrictions get any worse more people with cancer will die earlier than they need to.’

Mr Stone, who was awarded an MBE for his services to health, successfully lobbied Prime Minister David Cameron, his local MP, to create a £200million Cancer Drugs Fund for England in 2011.

The father of two, who lives alone since his wife died of breast cancer in 2011, said: ‘More than 38,000 patients have benefited, we have made a difference.

‘But I look forward to the time when very ill patients do not have to spend their precious time trying to access effective drugs which are freely available in other countries.’
