It hit Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories, Turkey, Israel and even the deserts of Egypt with rare snow and rain.

It has caused flight delays and road blocks in Amman.

The
 weather even featured in talks between visiting U.S. Secretary of State
 John Kerry and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said he was 
briefed on the emergency measures.

Kerry, a former Massachusetts senator, said the snow made him feel 'at home.'

'I
 have heard of making guests welcome and feeling at home. This is about 
as far as I've ever seen anything go ... giving me a New England 
snowstorm,' Kerry said as he viewed a snow-covered Old City of Jerusalem
 with Netanyahu.
