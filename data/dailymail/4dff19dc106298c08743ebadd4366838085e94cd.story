One of five Minneapolis teenagers charged in the death of a classmate from a synthetic drug overdose has pleaded guilty to third-degree murder.

Cole A. Matenaer, 19, of Woodbury pleaded guilty to providing a designer psychedelic drug similar to LSD that killed 17-year-old Tara Fitzgerald on January 11, just hours after she took it. She was a Woodbury High School junior.

Four others also face third-degree murder charges related to the sale and distribution of controlled substances.

Guilty plea: Cole A. Matenaer, 19, will be sentenced in October after pleading guilty to third-degree murder in the death of 17-year-old Tara Fitzgerald

Loss: Tara Fitzgerald died after taking a synthetic drug similar to LSD in January

Prosecutors say they were part of a Washington County drug-dealing chain.

The Star Tribune reports that the substance, known as 25i-NBOMe, is sometimes called N-Bomb or Smiles.

Matenaer is scheduled to be sentenced in October.

Fred Fink, head of the criminal division in the Washington County attorney’s office, says a prison sentence of 74 to 103 months is likely, though the judge has discretion.

Others charged with third-degree murder in Fitzgerald’s death were Sydney C. Johnson, now 18, of Woodbury; Alistair C. Berg and Brian P. Norlander, both 17 and of Woodbury; and Alexander L. Claussen, 19, of St. Cloud.

Drug death: Tara Fitzgerald died the morning after taking a synthetic drug known as Smiles

The younger three, who will be classed as adults in court, are also facing a felony charge of selling dangerous drugs to a person under 17.

The charges were made as Woodbury police traced the supply line after Tara died from a fatal overdose of a synthetic form of LSD known as 25i-NBOMe.

Tara
 Fitzgerald, a talented student and musician, died in her parents' home 
in January, after taking the drug during a sleepover.

'When an illegal drug enters our 
community, all of those involved - those who create it, sell it or give 
it away - are responsible for what happens with that drug,' county attorney Pete Orput told the Star Tribune.

Johnson, Berg, Norlander and Matenaer are accused of buying and selling the LSD, and Claussen is accused of being the supplier. Police said 305 doses of the drug were found in his home.

Norlander is accused of selling the drug to Tara after a chain of sales involving the other defendants.

According to the police complaint seen by Twin Cities, Claussen sold it to Matenaer at the end of 2013. Matenaer sold the drug to Johnson, who sold it to Berg.

Promising: Tara, 17, was described as a good student who loved making videos

Norlander allegedly bought it at the end of December, and is accused of selling the synthetic LSD to Fitzgerald around January 4.

After her death, Orput said: 'It's the worst thing that can happen to all of us. We've got to do something about this.'

Tara had been described by her school principal as an 'excellent student and a valued member' of the school community.

She had enjoyed making amusing videos and skateboarding, and liked listening to British bands.

'She was not a big party girl. She was a leader, witty, with a sense of humor,' Bill Hedahl, who used to coach Tara for a softball team, said.

Arrest: Five teenagers are facing third-degree murder charges in connection with Tara's death

Woodbury police chief Lee Vague defended the decision to charge the teenagers in connection with Tara's death. 

'These
 are smart kids knowingly selling what they think is LSD. They're making a pretty poor choice,' he said.

'If you make a choice and that 
choice results in the death of a young girl, you're going to be held 
accountable for that.'
