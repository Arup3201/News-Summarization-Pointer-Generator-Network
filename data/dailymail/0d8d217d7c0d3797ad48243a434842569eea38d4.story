Plenty of people are guilty of quickly judging people based on their appearance or accent.

And now scientists have found that we trust strangers with easier-to pronounce names.

Simpler and more easily recognisable names make people come across as more familiar and less risky to know, according to a new study.

Adults with attractive faces are more likely to win the trust of children, psychologists have said.

Scientists tested 32 four and five-year-olds who were shown 12 photos of women aged between 18 and 29.

Both boys and girls tended to believe answers assigned to pictures of pretty women, according to the study that was published in October last year.

Lead researcher Dr Igor Bascandziev, from Harvard University in the US, said: 'When learning about the world, children rely heavily on information provided to them by other people.

'Previous studies have shown children can be influenced by a range of factors such as whether the adult was correct in the past or if they are familiar to them.

Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, found that people who speak English trust strangers with easier-to-pronounce names more than those with names that are more difficult to say– even when those strangers are from the same country.

People are more likely to trust claims made by strangers with straight-forward names, they said.

The scientists created fictitious pairs of names from different parts of the world, including the Middle East, Asia and Europe, making sure that one name was easy to pronounce and the other more difficult.

They then examined people’s responses to the name pairs. In one experiment, participants imagined they were tourists looking for a reliable tour guide, while in another test, they were asked to decide how dangerous each person on a list of strangers was, based on nothing but their name.

‘In each experiment, strangers with easy-to-pronounce names were judged as being more familiar, more trustworthy and safer,’ said Eryn Newman, a postdoctoral fellow in the university’s Department of Criminology, Law and Society.

People with easily-pronounceable names enjoy a variety of benefits, according to a number of scientific studies.

They perceived as more likable, more electable and more accomplished.

People trust strangers with simple names as they come across as being more familiar and less risky to know.

‘But what was most surprising is that the pronunciation of names had effects that extended beyond the name.

'People actually thought claims attributed to easy-to-pronounce names were more likely to be true,’ she said.

According to the study that was published in the journal Plos One, the assertion that ‘macadamia nuts are in the same evolutionary family as peaches’ was more believable when attributed to ‘Andrian Babeshko’ than when it was credited to his countryman ‘Czeslaw Ratynska.’

Dr Newman explained that the phenomenon isn’t confined to people’s names.

‘When we encounter new information, how easy or difficult it is to process plays an important role in all sorts of situations. For example, research shows people think that food additives with easier names are safer than those with difficult names.’

She thinks that the feeling of familiarity in the brain signals something we can trust, but information that is hard to process, signals danger.

The study builds upon previous findings on the wide range of benefits enjoyed by people with easy-to-pronounce names, such as being perceived as more likable, more electable and more accomplished.
