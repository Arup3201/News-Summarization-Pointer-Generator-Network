A mother-of-four who found it impossible to lose all her baby weight through healthy diet and exercise alone has launched a line of heat-emitting 'slimwear', her own invention, and one which helped her drop three dress sizes.

Farnaz Khan, 33, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, shrunk from a size 14 to an eight after she found a link between weight-loss and heat and began experimenting with enormous underpants and.... clingfilm.

She said: 'As you can imagine it wasn't very practical. There were strange noises coming from
around me - yes, it was the clingfilm - so I started looking at the 
idea of applying heat into a pair of pants.'

Before and after: Farnaz pictured before losing the weight, left, and after, right, when she'd experimented with heat-emitting underwear using big pants and clingfilm

Hot pants: The heat-emitting underwear is today's answer to wrapping yourself in clingfilm, but is much more practical, and wearers are likely to shift up to three dress sizes

Despite having no background in technology, Farnaz continued with her research and came up with Fit Britches, a range of clothing and underwear designed to help slimmers lose inches, reduce signs of cellulite and aid skin elasticity. Including a £34.99 pair of Skinny Knickers.

She said: 'When you think about it, exercising is all about heating your core body temperature which, in layman's terms, increases micro-circulation and metabolism that leads to weight loss.

'Fit Britches work through using an innovative fibre and knitting. The special yarn is the key ingredient.

'It emits heat when it comes into contact with the skin - but not enough to be noticed by the wearer - and improves metabolism, blood flow and leads to stimulation of the body's lymphatic draining system to melt away toxins and fat.'

Farnaz explained that she originally created the product for herself, but
when people commented on her weight-loss she found she had accidentally 
creating a demand for it.

Average loss after 60 days:

'I kept getting approached by family and 
friends wanting to know what my slimming secret was,' she said. Her website has received 200,000 hits since launching in January.

The product was tested on 50 women, 
aged 20 to 60, all overweight and with sedentary lifestyles, who wore 
the pants for eight hours a day over 60 days, without a change in diet 
or lifestyle.

According to the study, the results 
after 60 days, on an average loss basis, were 5in from the waist, 3in 
from the hips, 3in from the bottom and 4in from the thighs.

The results also show a 92 per cent higher 
skin-blood microcirculation, eight per cent more skin elasticity, 11 per
cent improved cellulite signs, nine per cent more collagen synthesis, 
51 per cent better thermoregulation and 33 per cent lower lactate 
accumulation.

Farnaz - who recommends wearing Fit Britches as part of a healthy regime, incorporating diet and exercise - said: 'I used to hate having my picture 
taken,' she said. Now I'm a lot happier without the excess weight, it 
has done wonders for my confidence.

'Achieving a good weight and size 
also takes years off you. I often find myself having to convince people 
that I'm a 33-year-old mum of four!'

Drop three dress sizes: Farnaz claims her large underpants can help the wearer shrink by three dress sizes and lose up to five inches from around their waist and hips

The clothing range includes shorts, knickers, leggings and tops and is designed to wear to the gym, the office or at home. The shapewear was featured on ITV's This Morning as the 'top fashion pick' by The Only Way Is Essex star Gemma Collins.

She has since launched corporate brand 8London, specialising in high technology apparel, to support her Fit Britches shapewear.

Bradford's business support network Rising Stars is now working with Farnaz on developing a business plan.

'Farnaz
is a shining example of the entrepreneurial spirit we have in Bradford,
and her success with Fit Britches is a testament to the support and 
advice available to those who want it.'
