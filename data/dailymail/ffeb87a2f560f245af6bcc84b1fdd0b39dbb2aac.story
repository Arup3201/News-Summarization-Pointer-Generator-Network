Mick Jagger's former Brazilian lover has told her country to stop 'cyber-bullying' him after he was branded a national curse for backing Brazil in the World Cup.

The Rolling Stones singer, 70, was spotted in a VIP box at the Mineirao stadium on Tuesday night as the host nation was thrashed 7-1 by Germany in one of the worst defeats of the tournament's history.

His support came to the dismay of fans who had nicknamed Jagger 'pe frio' - the jinx - for lending his backing to a string of doomed sides earlier in the tournament.

The jinx! For weeks Mick Jagger has been dubbed a World Cup curse for backing several doomed sides - culminating in his appearance in a VIP box with his son (centre) for Brazil's 7-1 trouncing by Germany

Watching on: Mick Jagger and his son Lucas watch the game in Belo Horizonte

No satisfaction: Dismayed fans believed the 70-year-old Rolling Stones frontman was such a curse that they made cardboard cut-outs of him in Germany's team kit and declaring his support for the rival side

In all three cases the teams lost immediately after Jagger declared they would win, mostly at Rolling Stones concerts in the countries themselves.

Brazil fans had even made cardboard cut-outs of Jagger 
supporting rival teams as a good luck charm after his branding as 'pe frio', which literally means 'cold feet'.

But last night he was spotted cheering on Brazil for the crucial match in Belo Horizonte - wearing an England cap for good measure.

He shared a VIP box with Lucas, his 15-year-old son by the Brazilian model and celebrity Luciana Giminez, who watched the humiliating defeat wearing a signed Brazil team shirt.

Also in the box was Kia 
Joorabchian, the Iranian agent for a number of Brazil squad players.

Curse: The World Cup has coincided with a Rolling Stones world tour (pictured) in which Jagger has offered words of support to whichever country his band entertains - often with seemingly disastrous results

Slurs: One Brazilian news network, R7, called the Rolling Stones frontman 'the biggest jinx in history'Â 

Brazilian news network R7 ran a large photo of Jagger in the VIP box declaring he was 'invincible!' and 'the biggest jinx in history'.

The mockery was so huge it pushed Ms Giminez, who had Jagger's child in 1999, to launch an impassioned defence of him on her Instagram account.

National figure of fun: Jagger has made headlines

'Mick has been successful for 50 years, he's a good friend and GOOD FATHER to my 15-year-old son.

'He is suffering cyber bullying .... and I would like to ask you guys who do this kind of bullying to think before you do it.

'Even though it only seems like a small thing, Mick is a person like us all, and he does not deserve to be treated this way by Brazilians.'

She also posted videos of herself in a Brazil shirt describing how sad she was in French.

The World Cup has coincided with a Rolling Stones world tour in which Jagger has offered words of support to whichever country his band entertains - often with seemingly disastrous results.

Jagger
 earned his nickname after he told fans during a show in Rome that Italy
 would beat Uruguay and advance to the knockout stages, but the Italians
 lost and were eliminated.

He then told fans in Lisbon that Portugal would win the World Cup - and they too were eliminated.

He reportedly joined Bill Clinton to cheer on the United States, who lost to Ghana in the second round.

And after rooting for England against Uruguay, they too were humiliated by two Suarez goals.

It is not the first time Brazilians have described Jagger as a curse for the national side.

During
 the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, some parts of the Brazilian media 
claimed their team lost to the Netherlands in the quarter finals because
 Jagger wore a Brazil shirt to the game.

He's got history: Brazil fans before the quarter-final match. Jagger has been blamed for national defeats before

Anyone but us: Fans used the same cardboard cut-out trick before Brazil's quarter-final clash against Colombia
