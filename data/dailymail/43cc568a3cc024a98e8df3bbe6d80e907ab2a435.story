Harry Redknapp believes someone at QPR is trying to get him the sack by leaking stories to the media.

Redknapp is the bookmakers favourite to be the next Premier League manager to lose his job and one newspaper claimed this week that lose to Manchester United on Saturday and he would be sacked.

And the QPR boss claimed 'somebody is trying to cause me a problem here, by talking to the papers'.

QPR manager Harry Redknapp says people at the club are trying to get him out

The former Tottenham boss believes he retains the full support of QPR owner Tony Fernandes, but admitted he suspects challenges to his stewardship elsewhere behind the scenes.

Redknapp believes a win over Manchester United at Loftus Road on Saturday would wipe out any talk of him leaving the club.

'Somebody is trying to cause me a problem here, by talking to the papers,' said Redknapp.

'I know what the score is: I'm not silly, I'm very streetwise. Someone's trying to cause me a problem I'm sure.

'I wasn't born yesterday. Someone has said something, but it's not a problem.

'I've never had it before, I've never been at a club before where someone has said I'm going to get the sack. And I don't see why, who puts it in the paper? Someone's put it in the paper.

Redknapp says he has a good relationship with chairman Tony Fernandes 

'If I win tomorrow it's all forgotten. I'm not silly. There's always someone trying to put the spoke in.

'They should check everyone's mobile phones and find out. That's the best way, it's easy.'

Redknapp is determined to drag QPR to Premier League safety despite the club sitting 19th in the table.

The 67-year-old ex-West Ham boss admitted, however, he cannot guarantee he will remain in management next season.

'I'm not sure yet,' said Redknapp when asked if he would continue next campaign, even if not at QPR.

'When I get fed up with it I'll wake up one morning and say 'I've had enough' but I'm not sure when that will be. It could be any time.

'I've been through lots of bad situations, far worse than facing Man Utd tomorrow.

'It's up to the chairman, whatever he wants to do. I love Tony Fernandes and I don't say that because I'm creeping up to him, it's because he's a great guy. And if he says to me 'Harry, I'm going to go down a different route', fine, that's his choice, what can I do?

'You do your best, that's all you do. If someone goes out, falls over the ball and concedes a goal, what can I do? You can only try your best and I've had a great time, and I want to continue doing it.

'I spoke to Tony this week, he's not mentioned anything of that nature to me, and until he does, I'll keep doing what I do.

'It's up to other people at the club. It's not easy, no-one's pretending otherwise.'
