The winner of this year's X Factor will be crowned on Sunday after almost four months of auditions and live shows. 

Bookies are tipping Fleur East for the title, but real time Google data suggests the award will actually go to Andrea Faustini. 

In the past week, searches for the Italian contestant have been rising rapidly and the search engine is predicting a victory for the 20-year-old singer.

Earlier this week, the data suggested second place would go to Ben Haenow and Fleur East would sit in third. But overnight, Ms East overtook the van driver from Croydon. 

This suggests Ms East could make a last-minute surge for the title.

The trends are based on real-time searches and rising trends collected by Google and are more accurate and up-to-date than the publicly-available charts.

According to historical data taken from Google's public trending tool, however, Ms East has been consistently the most searched-for contestant of the past 30 days, worldwide. 

Following her performances on the 15 and 22 November, searches for the 27-year-old fitness model were higher than the other two finalists. 

But, Ben Haenow's performance of The Beatles' Come Together on 29 November made him the most searched for contestant that week. 

Until this week, Mr Haenow was losing ground to Mr Faustini, but more recently the pair have received a more even split of Google searches.  

Overall, though, the most popular performance throughout the whole series has been Ms East's Uptown Funk - a cover of an upcoming Mark Ronson single featuring Bruno Mars. 

This was seen by a significant peak for searches for Fleur East following the performance last weekend.
