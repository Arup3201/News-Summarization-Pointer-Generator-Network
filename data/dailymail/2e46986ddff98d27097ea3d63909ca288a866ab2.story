The man accused of killing his new bride as they honeymooned in Australia did so to profit from it, and displayed little distress as others tried to resuscitate her, a court heard yesterday.

Gabe Watson, 34, drowned Tina Watson, 26, in 2003 by turning off her air supply, prosecutors say.

But defence lawyers insisted as his Alabama trial began on Tuesday that her death was an accident.

He thought he could collect $210,000 from a life insurance and travel policy, and it is also alleged that Watson tried to get her diamond engagement ring back.

Australian police didn't believe his varying tales about what happened in the Great Barrier Reef, prosecutors said.

Prosecutor Andrew Arrington told the jury: 'The problem is all the times the defendant has lied. Why is he lying?'

'Tina trusted her husband,’ Mr Arrington told the court, while Watson’s new wife Kim 
Lewis, who bears a strong resemblance to Tina, sat listening. ‘She felt 
safe diving with him.’

Watson allegedly turned off his wife's
air supply while both were underwater and held her in a bear-hug until 
she lost consciousness - before turning the air back on and letting her sink.

The jury of eight women and six men 
looked at a haunting underwater photo taken by another diver of the 
death scene.

It showed Tina sprawled in deep water as Watson swam to the
surface.

But Watson’s defence team claimed the 
prosecution is based on ‘bumbling’ detectives in Australia believing 
that a problem with a dive computer on his wrist proved he killed the 
woman he loved.

That mistake early in the 
investigation made police wrongly see innocent actions and circumstances
as proof of a crime, defence lawyer Brett Bloomston told the court in 
Birmingham, Alabama.

Was it murder? Gabe Watson says his wife Tina Watson died as the result of a terrible diving accident

Rather than being murdered, Tina 
struggled and knocked off her husband's air supply and diving mask, 
forcing him to resurface without her, Mr Bloomston said. She drowned on 
her own, he said.

‘This is a tragic case,’ Mr Bloomston 
said. ‘What's even more tragic is the blame Gabe has had to live with 
this last number of years.’ He added that Tina’s father was the 
beneficiary on her life insurance.

That policy was worth only $33,000, 
not the $165,000 claimed by prosecutors, he said, and a travel policy 
for $45,000 was only to cover the cost of the trip. ‘There was no 
financial motive,’ Mr Bloomston said.

Mr Bloomston argued that Tina Watson 
contributed to her own death by waiving an orientation dive and placing 
too much weight in a device meant to help her stay underwater during the
dive.

She panicked once during a diving 
class in a flooded suburban rock quarry, Mr Bloomston said, suggesting 
that she may have panicked again in the fatal dive.

Brett Bloomston, defending

Mr Bloomston denied prosecution claims
that Watson was a highly trained rescue diver who should have been able
to save Tina, and instead said they were both ‘very inexperienced’ 
underwater.

Watson initially was charged with 
murder in Australia, after Tina’s body was found near Townsville, 
Queensland, but he pleaded guilty to a lesser manslaughter charge and 
served 18 months in prison.

A grand jury in Alabama also indicted 
him for capital murder as he allegedly planned his new bride's death 
while still in the state. A judge granted a defence motion to have one 
murder count dropped.

Before Australian authorities would 
release Watson to the U.S., Alabama had to agree to waive the death 
penalty as a possible punishment, prosecutors said. He faces life in 
prison if convicted.

'There was no financial motive'

Brett Bloomston, defending

Australian authorities performed 
exhaustive tests to try to recreate Tina Watson's death, which occurred 
soon after the couple's wedding. A coroner’s report threw up some 
interesting ideas.

Gabe Watson said his wife looked 
concerned seven minutes into their dive and knocked his mask off in 
panic. By the time he retrieved the mask, he said Tina was sinking too 
fast for him to catch her.

Tina was an inexperienced diver and he
had rescue certification, the report said. The Alabama trial poses 
logistical challenges, as up to a dozen witnesses will be flown in from 
Australia to testify.

The state of Alabama has also 
subpoenaed people from California to testify about what happened that 
day on a dive boat called the Spoilsport, but it's unclear how many will
take the stand.
