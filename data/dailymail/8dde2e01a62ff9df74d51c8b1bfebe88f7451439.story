Tragic: David Bogenberger joined fraternity because he just 'wanted to fit in.' His family are now suing Pi Kappa Alpha

The family of a Northern Illinois University freshman who died of alcohol poisoning after an initiation party is suing the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house.

David Bogenberger, 19,  was found dead in a bunk bed on November 2, 2012.

He had five times the legal driving limit of alcohol in his blood. 

The student's father, Gary Bogenberger, filed a lawsuit against the fraternity's national organization on Thursday.

As reported by the Chicago Tribune, Bogenberger alleges that the leaders of the Eta Nu chapter made heavy drinking a condition of membership and encouraged his son to consume 'excessive and dangerous amounts of alcohol.'

The lawsuit claims that the national organization of Pi Kappa Alpha failed to make sure that its chapters were warned about the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption.

The father also alleges that the organization did not make enough effort to ensure the chapter at Northern Illinois followed its hazing policies.

'The national organization has a 
responsibility to provide meaningful training, supervision and oversight
to its local chapters, so that fraternity members understand that 
alcohol-related hazing is ... potentially deadly,' the Bogenberger 
family lawyer Peter Coladarci said.

Twenty two university students are also facing charges following the death of a freshman who died after downing vodka in the hazing ceremony.

Bogenberger had to answer a series of questions at Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity in Northern Illinois University in exchange for alcohol in a two-hour ritual on November 1.

The attorney of David's family told the Chicago Tribune the finance major just 'wanted to be liked'.

Five leaders of the fraternity were charged in November with felony hazing by DeKalb County authorities. A further 17 members face misdemeanor charges. The fraternity stopped operating following David's death.

The initiation was part of an annual ritual dubbed 'parents night' where new recruits are assigned to senior members and encouraged to drink excessive quantities of alcohol.

David, from Palatine, Cook County, had made a pledge to the house so he could make friends.

Coladarci
told the Tribune: 'He wanted to be accepted. It's a classic case of a 
kid who just wants to fit in with the group.'

Fraternity
president Alexander M. Jandick, 21; vice president James P Harvey, 21; 
pledge adviser Omar Salameh, 21; secretary Patrick W Merrill, 19, and 
event planner Steven A Libert have all been charged with felony hazing.

If convicted they face up to three years in jail or probation.

In a statement released by police in November, David's family said they want to see 'significant change'.

It
read: 'We have no desire for revenge. We must realize that young people
can and do die in hazing rituals. Alcohol-involved hazing and 
initiation must end.'

Northern Illinois University, pictured, has also brought disciplinary charges

Mr Coladarci said the family are not seeking an 'eye for an eye' but said such college campus hazing incidents are a 'national health epidemic'.

Police have accused the fraternity leaders had deliberately not told campus officials about the party so they would not be subject to inspections.

Lieutenant Jason Leverton, of the DeKalb Police Department, said the group 'knowingly' did not register the event because of the quantity of alcohol they planned to consume.

Mr Coladarci said one of the students, believed to be facing charges, call David's family to express his regret.

Temporary sanctions have been placed on the fraternity by the university.

The university has also announced disciplinary charges against 31 members, who are accused of breaking the student code of conduct.
