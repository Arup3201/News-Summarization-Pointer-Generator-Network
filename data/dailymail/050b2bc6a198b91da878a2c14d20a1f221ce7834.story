When Ken Cherry says his marriage was a lie, he isn't exaggerating. 

That's because the St Louis man just learned that his wife Susan was committing bigamy the nine years they were together, since she never divorced her last husband. 

Cherry says he was supposed to be his wife's fifth husband, and he fears he might not be her last. Police have allegedly refused to charge Susan with bigamy and she is already listed as 'single' on  a free dating website, according to a report by KTVI.

‘What kind of dummy was I to get myself caught up in something like this?' Cherry said.

A sham: Ken Cherry (right) married Susan Bozich (left) in 2006 and only realized last year that she was married to another man the whole time 

Betrayed: Cherry says police have refused to charge his ex-wife with bigamy, since the statue of limitations on the crime is just one year

Cherry says he met Susan Bozich 11 years ago through mutual friends at a concert. They hit it off and two years later, in 2006, they tied the knot. 

But the marriage didn't last and last year the couple filed for divorcee. 

It was during their legal battle that Cherry hired private investigator Rick Burrows, who discovered Bozich's marital secret. 

 ‘I started looking for the divorce file from husband number four. I couldn't find it. So I found him.’ Burrows said. 'I said: "Did you two ever get divorced?" He said: "No"'. 

That revelation quickly brought the divorce proceedings to an end, with a judge ruling a 'consent judgement' declaring the Cherrys' marriage void.

Getting back in the game: Apparently Susan is already listed on a free dating website as 'single' even its believed she is still married to her fourth husband 

While Cherry says many people find the situation humorous, he finds it hard to laugh.

When asked how he considers the years he spent in a false marriage, Cherry responds: 'Wasted'. 

'There was some good, just not the marriage part,' he said. ‘You`d never be able to convince me it was an innocent mistake.’

And to add insult in injury, Cherry says local police have refused to arrest his ex-wife for bigamy based on the fact that there is a statue of limitations of only one year for bigamy and his marriage was nine years ago. 

However, such cases have been prosecuted in the area before, based on the time the bigamy was discovered. In this case, it was just a few months ago. 

Cherry also says that his ex-wife continues to live in their former home, even though he is the owner and his name is on the title.
