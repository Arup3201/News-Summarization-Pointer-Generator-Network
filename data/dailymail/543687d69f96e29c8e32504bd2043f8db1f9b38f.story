Forget what the scoreboard says - Wednesday was a good day for England.

The Trent Bridge pitch was one of the most lifeless I’ve seen in this country for some time, but I thought England improved in all the areas that could have been asked of them.

They caught well, especially the blinder held by Ian Bell at silly mid-on to see off Cheteshwar Pujara.

Their over rate was excellent.

Right direction: Alastair Cook and Peter Moores' should be pleased with what England delivered on day one

Spectacular: Bell takes the ball in his fingertips at full stretch at silly mid-on

Matt Prior, who had a question mark over his glovework at Headingley, was superb.

Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad kept going on a lifeless pitch.

And, perhaps most encouragingly of all, Alastair Cook had a very good day with his tactics. He was especially good after the two breaks: Pujara and Virat Kohli fell shortly after lunch, with Cook setting a silly mid-on for Pujara, while Ajinkya Rahane departed just after tea.

He realised the ball was reversing and set tight fields. And he did well to get a silly point into Rahane. I know that the catch he took was a little fortuitous, but a couple of balls earlier one had landed just short of him in the same position. Cook knew what he was doing.

I also thought he rotated the bowlers well. Given the conditions, there were a lot of good things happening.

I also liked the way Prior was urging his slip cordon to get up closer to the stumps because of the slowness of the surface.

My only criticism was that Cook could have set a third man earlier than he did. On a pitch like this, Indian batsmen don’t need a second invitation to open the face of their bats. And if you’re only having one slip, you risk leaking a lot of runs.

In terms of the pitch itself, I’m not one to try to overdo home advantage.

If the pitch had been covered with grass, for example, then it would have brought India’s seamers into the game too. But a Test pitch has got to have some carry in it.

Without carry, you risk losing the spectacle. The ball goes through at shin height, and a ring field can make run-scoring difficult.

Trent Bridge has often been flat. I remember David Gower’s side failing to take a wicket all day here in a Test against Australia in 1989. But even that had a bit of bounce and carry in it.

Thankfully, England managed to get the ball to reverse yesterday. But if Test cricket is going to survive and flourish, we need surfaces with something in them for everyone.

As for Murali Vijay, he just reminds me of every other young Indian batsman I see these days.

They all just know how to bat. You don’t look at them and spot an obvious technical weakness, and they just make batting look so easy.

He left very well as his innings developed, and this success - in his first Test innings in England - will give him a lot of confidence as the series progresses. And if this pitch starts to show signs of uneven bounce as the game goes on, it could prove a mighty valuable knock.
