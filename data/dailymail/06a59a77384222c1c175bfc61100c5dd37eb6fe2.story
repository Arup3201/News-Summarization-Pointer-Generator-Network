The spurned first lady lover of Francois Hollande will this week publish an explosive book in which the French president is ‘not spared’, it emerged today. 

Thank You For The Moment, which comes out on Thursday, is said to be a no-holds-barred account of Valerie Trierweiler’s 18 months at the Elysee Palace.

It will be the first time that a serving French head of state has been exposed to a ‘kiss and tell’ book while still in office.

Ms Trierweiler’s time as first lady ended ignominiously in January when the 49-year-old was effectively sacked from her high profile role. It followed revelations about Mr Hollande’s secret love affair with the 42-year-old TV actress, Julie Gayet.

He was regularly going to see the divorced mother-of-two on the back of a moped accompanied by security guards while officially being with Ms Trierweiler.

The humiliation was so great for Ms Trierweiler, who herself has three children from an earlier marriage, that she checked herself into a public hospital for eight days suffering from ‘stress’.

Mr Hollande had a secret love affair with Julie Gayet, pictured here attending the Opening Ceremony and Birdman premiere during the 71st Venice Film Festival on August 27

She said that being cheated on and then dumped by Mr Hollande felt like ‘falling from a skyscraper’ and ‘like being hit by a high speed trains’.

Such dramatic metaphors are expected to fill Thank You for the Moment, which will pour further ridicule on Mr Hollande.

Breaking news of the upcoming book, French parliamentary commentator Brigitte Boucher said Mr Hollande ‘would not be spared’, not to mention the entire Elysee Palace soap opera.

Mr Trierweiler, who forged her career as a journalist on Paris Match, has already blamed 'low blows', 'betrayals' and 'back-stabbing' for the way she was treated. She originally said she wanted to be a Princess Diana style ‘Queen of Hearts’ who travels the world helping the poor and the sick.

However, she was widely mocked in France for travelling around Mumbai in a chauffeur driven limousine while staying in the five star Taj Palace Hotel during a humanitarian trip to India earlier this year.

Ms Trierweiler is often referred to as 'Rotteweiler' because of the way she savages her enemies and critics are already referring to the book as the 'Rottweiler's Revenge'.

Mr Hollande, who had never married, remains a ‘bachelor president’, although he has four grown-up children with his Ecology Minister, Segolene Royal.

Ms Gayet has not spoken since pictures were published of Mr Hollande leaving their Paris love nest on the back of a moped, while using a crash helmet as a poor disguise.

Ms Trierweiler is yet to comment on Thank You For This Moment (Merci Pour Ce Moment) which is being prepared under conditions of great secrecy. It is published by editions Les Arènes.

Carla Bruni has made a heartfelt plea to her husband Nicolas Sarkozy to stay out of politics because it makes her 'mad with anger'.

The former French president, who turns 60 in January, is under investigation for a range of corruption charges which could see him go to prison.

Yet supporters believe that the country's Socialist head of state, Francois Hollande, is failing so spectacularly that even 'Sarko' can beat him.

This has worried Ms Bruni, 46, with a friend telling Le Parisien newspaper that she provoked a domestic crisis during the couple's summer holiday in Bali.

'Carla threw a fit at him,' said the source. 'She doesn't want him to return. She can't stand the nastiness, the hatred.'

Referring to Mr Sarkozy's single period of office, which ended in failure in 2012 following defeat by Mr Hollande, the friend added: 'She was wounded and is still mad with anger.'

The couple were widely attacked and ridiculed during the five years, especially for their high-living and alleged vulgarity.

Mr Sarkozy was said to be obsessed with making as much money as possible, while even Carla's charity activities came under scrutiny.

The supermodel turned pop singer is particularly angry over claims - which she denies - that she wasted public money and enriched friends with her personal fundraiser, the Carla Bruni Foundation.

Carla, who was often likened to the former French queen Marie Antoinette during her time as first lady, is still convinced the media wants 'to skin her man alive'.

However, many commentators believe that Carla's latest outburst - made during a time when she was suffering from tendinitis in the shoulder - is all part of a carefully coordinated media campaign.

The couple posed for pictures on a scooter for the glossy magazine Paris Match last month, giving an impression of marital bliss.

One Paris analyst said: 'The idea is that Sarkozy will sacrifice domestic happiness for the good of France - both he and Carla know all about getting their PR message across!'

Allies insist Mr Sarkozy's likely comeback as leader of the UMP opposition in time for the 2017 presidential election was never in doubt.

Former finance minister Michel Sapin said of Mr Sarkozy: 'I have no doubt that he has wanted to make a comeback from the first day.'

The allegations against Mr Sarkozy include claims that he received millions in illegal cash from the late Libyan dictator, Colonel Gaddafi. He denies all the charges.
