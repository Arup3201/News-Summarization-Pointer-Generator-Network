A woman who repeatedly punched a man in an unprovoked attack boasted about walking free from court – while posting photos on Facebook with her thumbs up.

Sophie Sheldon was part of a group of drunk thugs who partially blinded a man in the brutal attack outside a nightclub in Birmingham.

CCTV footage shows the 20-year-old leaning over the helpless victim as he lies in agony on the floor, punching him in the face.

Her accomplices can also be seen lashing Ismail Bensalaman, 33, in the face with his belt, destroying his eye.

She was handed a suspended sentence of two years and a six-month curfew by Judge Paul Farrer, who said the violent behaviour was not in her character. 

After she was spared jail this week, Sheldon caused outrage by posting celebratory pictures outside court on Facebook. 

The young woman also uploaded an image of herself grinning and giving the thumbs-up in a taxi after her sentencing hearing. 

She updated her Facebook status saying: ‘Guess who’s back again, Sophie’s back so tell your friends.

‘After a long old day glad to be home and put my feet up and have a well-deserved glass of wine.’

Mr Ismail was attacked by Simeon Evans, 30, and Jack Gargham, 26, after he left a nightclub at 6am on January 26 last year.

The group began arguing with him over a taxi, Birmingham Crown Court heard. 

Footage shows Mr Bensalaman trying to run away.

He was chased and took off his belt to protect himself, but Evans grabbed it and hit him with it. The tip of the belt caught him in his left eye, leaving it permanently blinded.

Gargham also began raining down heavy blows. While the victim was on the ground Sheldon joined in.

Evans, from Bromford, was jailed for four years and six months after pleading guilty to causing GBH with intent. 

Gargham, from Rubery, was sentenced to four years and five months after being found guilty of the same charge.

Sheldon, who works in a beauty salon, was spared jail after the court heard that hours before the attack, her estranged mother had committed suicide after a row with her. 

The young woman from Gwent, South Wales, who delivered at least four punches and a kick to Mr Bensalaman while wearing high heels, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was given a two-year suspended sentence with a six-month curfew.

Sentencing, Judge Paul Farrer said: ‘It is plain you acted out of character against a very particular background. Unwisely, you went to, in effect, drown your sorrows. The violence you used was minimal.

‘You did not intend to cause serious injury ... You are hardworking, have potential and are well thought of. It is very likely you will never offend in the future and that allows me to take an exceptional course.’

Her victim however said her Facebook posts suggested she felt no remorse, adding he did not understand the British justice system 'at all'. 

Yesterday, Mr Ismail, from Sparkbrook in Birmingham, said: ‘She is not even human. She has shown no remorse.

'How would she feel if this happened to her, or to somebody she cared about? 

'I thought I was going to die. It was absolutely terrifying. These people showed no mercy. 

'They were so aggressive. I am totally depressed. I can’t work and I can’t drive.’ 

The 33-year-old continued, 'She was the one who was causing all of the trouble in the first place and she has not even gone to jail.

'I do not understand this British justice system at all. 

'I am pleased the men have been jailed, but I would have liked them to have been given more years in prison. 

'No amount of time in prison or compensation could ever replace my eye. It has changed me forever.'

'No remorse': Mr Bensalaman said 20-year-old Sheldon was 'not human' after posting the celebratory messages

Mr Ismail, who has been in the UK for five years, has already had five operations and is due to undergo a sixth operation at the end of January.

His brother Ahmani Adlane Bensalaman, 40, from Liverpool added: 'He is a completely different person now.

'My brother used to work with me at a shop in Liverpool and I am doing my best to support him, but it is very difficult for him.

'They attacked him from behind and continued to assault him as he lay on the floor trying to defend himself.

'They are brainless and they are cowards.'    

Following yesterday's sentencing, Detective Constable Chris Smith of West Midlands Police said the attack had been 'mindless' and 'savage'.  

'The amount of mindless violence that was inflicted was totally over the top and was definitely fuelled by alcohol,' he said.

'The victim has had to go through an extensive amount of medical treatment including surgery.

'After an initial operation on his eye he needed further surgery and in March was told that he had lost the sight in his left eye permanently.

'He is still coming to terms with his injuries and has told me that he feels his life is over, and there’s no opportunity left to him.

'We accept yesterday’s decision and hope that the jail sentence brings some comfort to the victim.'
