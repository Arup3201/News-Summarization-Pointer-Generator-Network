Australians sit well on the worldwide dating scene, with the accent alone being ranked as the fourth most attractive on the planet.

And just after the city of love Paris, Melbourne in Victoria has the best dating scene, according to respondents to Time Out’s Global Dating Survey.

The study also concluded that Sydney has the happiest singletons, with 31 per cent ‘proudly single’ while the opposite was true in New York, where 45 per cent of respondents declared themselves ‘sad to be single’.

Meantime French has lost its place as the language of love – to English.

A British accent was chosen as the most attractive by 26.7 per cent of people answering a global survey of 11,000 people in 24 cities - followed by American, Irish and Australian accents.

French was chosen as the sexiest accent by just 7.7 per cent of respondents to the survey, coming in at fifth place.

And Parisians answering the survey were among the respondents most likely to fall for someone with a British accent, along with those from New York and Sydney.

But Gallic aficionados could still take some cheer from the survey.

Paris was ranked as the city with the best dating scene, followed by Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and Chicago – with London coming in at a lowly sixth.

Meanwhile, 53 per cent of people said they kissed on the first date and one in ten believe sex on a first date is acceptable. 

On average, couples had 3.53 dates before having sex - but still considered it acceptable to see other people until reaching six dates.

Technology is also important for modern-day lovers, with 58 per cent admitting to checking a prospective date's credentials on social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.

Answers to a question about the best and worst aspects of the local dating scene threw up some surprising results.

One was how the presence of 'infinitely more men than women due to an overabundance of military and security personnel' in Kabul made it easy for women to find a potential suitor.

But a respondent from Bogota, Colombia, complained: 'The guys are ugly and girls very beautiful. It's difficult'.
