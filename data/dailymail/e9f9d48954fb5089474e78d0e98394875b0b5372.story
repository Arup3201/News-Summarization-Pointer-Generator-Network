Zara Phillips and her team mates 
narrowly missed out on gold in the equestrian eventing today but 
spectators were still delighted.

Phillips
 made a heartbreaking early mistake in her showjumping round, adding to 
penalties clocked up by Team GB in the previous three days of 
competition, which cost them gold.

Nicola
 Wilson was given a tough score for her dressage on Saturday, while 
William Fox-Pitt fell prey to time penalties in the cross country 
yesterday.

Phillips' mother, the Princess Royal, herself a former Olympian, is set to present her daughter with her team medal later today.

The Queen's granddaughter was third up for the British equestrian eventing team this morning.

Supporters
 who had braved gloomy skies in Greenwich, south east London, fell into a
 hushed silence as she tackled the course, which included jumps 
featuring a miniature Nelson's column and bright red post boxes.

But they erupted into enthusiastic cheers once she had finished, waving Union flags.

Members
 of the Royal family turned out again to support her, with the Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry cheering her on.

Harry
 and William, both wearing white Team GB polo shirts, looked delighted 
as the Britons secured silver, as did the Duchess, who was wearing a blue and white nautical striped top under the navy £500 Smythe blazer that she wore to yesterday's event.

She accessorized her look with navy wedges and a navy clutch bag from high street brand Russell & Bromley.

The Duchess of Cambridge left the event today carrying an umbrella after some rain showers earlier on. She wore a blue and white stripey top with a navy Smythe blazer, fitted navy jeans and blue cork wedges

Zara's brother Peter Phillips, Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry seemed to be enjoying themselves as they laughed together in the stands

William and Kate seemed to be distracted by something up above whilst Harry concentrated on the event. Kate chose the same £500 navy blazer by Smythe as yesterday, this time teaming it with a chic Breton striped top

There were still a small number of 
empty seats in the arena, even though organisers had sold extra tickets 
to fill unused spaces.

Team GB began the day in second place 
after Phillips and her four team mates put in fantastic performances in 
the cross country yesterday.

A number of riders fell on the tricky 
course in historic Greenwich Park, but Phillips, Nicola Wilson, Mary 
King and Kristina Cook all avoided penalties by finishing within a tough
 time limit.

William Fox-Pitt just missed out when his horse tired towards the end of the course.

Phillips follows in the footsteps of 
her Olympian parents Princess Anne, who competed in the 1976 games in 
Montreal, and Mark Phillips, currently the US team's coach, who won 
medals in 1972 and 1988.

The 31-year-old, who was again watched by her mother today, said the crowd gave her a boost as she competed.

She said: 'It's incredible, it gives 
you a massive lift as you come into the arena. We're really grateful to 
everyone who've come here to cheer us on.'

Phillips recovered well after making an initial mistake and knocking a bar down on an early jump on her horse High Kingdom.

She said: 'It was a bit slow in the beginning but after that he got faster, it was my fault, not his. I'm really proud of him.'

Fans at the equestrian event were treated to spectacular views of the capital city taking in the historical Battersea Power Station, the modern towers of the financial district and St Paul's Cathedral

Kate and William cuddled up during the event but Harry didn't look as bemused as Kate as he sat with arms folded watching his cousin ride around the course

There were laughs all round for the young Royals as Kate and William cheered his cousin on in this afternoon's event

Things were tense on the course for 31-year-old Zara Phillips and her team but the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge looked relaxed and happy haring a joke in the crowd

The gloomy skies couldn't dampen the couples' spirits as they watched William's cousin Zara and her eventing team push for gold in the in the final day of the equestrian event

She said performing in front of a home crowd did not increase the pressure on her.

'It's the pressure that you put on yourself trying to get the best score you can for your team.'

Yesterday was the first anniversary of
 her wedding to rugby player Mike Tindall, but when asked if she had had
 a chance to celebrate, she laughed and said: 'No.'

High Kingdom lost both his front shoes in the cross-country yesterday but recovered well, she said.

'I'm really happy with him to be able to do that today.'

Phillips entered the arena to rapturous applause, quickly followed by silence as she tackled the jumps.

She said: 'It makes the noise of the poles falling even louder.'

Audience members today included former prime minister Sir John Major.

Kate and Harry once again displayed how close they are as they leaned in for a chat and smiled together whilst William watched the horses

The couple looked very much in love as they chatted and grinned at each other throughout the afternoon's event. Kate was sporting her trademark tousled locks

Phillips added: 'There was a mistake 
that we shouldn't have had because he's a good jumper and obviously it's
 disappointing for a team sport, but generally I'm really happy with 
him.'

When asked if the competition had been an emotional experience for her, she joked: 'It's like an emotional rollercoaster.'

Family members have come to support her every day of the eventing.

She said: 'It's nice that they've managed to come and watch.'

Fox-Pitt's wife Alice, who works as a 
racing journalist under her maiden name Plunkett, watched with her 
five-year-old son Thomas and gave a massive cheer as Tina Cook completed
 her round, bringing Team GB their silver medal.

She said her husband was 'ecstatic' with the result.

'Gold was there for the taking, obviously it's really disappointing that they didn't get it,' she said.

'It is not Zara's fault there were 
little mistakes. It's a team, it isn't about one person. William's time 
faults yesterday were expensive, there's a whole host of reasons - it's 
never down to one person.'

Mrs Fox-Pitt said the team was still 'thrilled' with their silver, adding: 'Obviously there's still the 
individual medals to play for.'

In the stands William and Harry both 
looked smart, with William donning a white shirt under a grey blazer and
 Harry also wearing a white collared shirt.

Kate and William showed their support to Team GB by wearing a gold and red Team GB badge fastened onto their blazers.

The three young Royals laughed and joked together as they watched the event.

Zara's mother Princess Anne sat with Camilla as they watched the riders gallop around the course.

Anne looked extremely patriotic donning a Team GB bag and two Olympic pins on her navy blazer.

Alongside
 the family, Zara's brother Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn watched 
on, both wearing full team GB gear, with matching hats.

The Queen's granddaughter is one of five members of the team, who went into the final day of the competition in second place.

The 31-year-old  scored a 
penalty-free ride through the treacherous cross-country event yesterday, 
negotiating her horse, High Kingdom, over 28 obstacles and a slippery course that 
claimed a dozen fallen riders.

Bea and Eugenie showed their support for the second day running but today they didn't sit with their cousins and took a seat behind their mother and Camilla

Princess Beatrice of York and Princess Eugenie of York come and have a chat with the other young Royal family members at the event
