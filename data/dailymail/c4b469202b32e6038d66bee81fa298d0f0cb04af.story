Former Premier League defender Chico Flores has been up to even more mischief this time feeding his pet monkey, yes that's right, pizza and desserts in a bizarre Instagram video.

Just a few days earlier Flores posted a photo of himself on Twitter in the bath with an unknown lady friend, with the message attached to it simply 'Relax'.

The 28-year-old has been making the most of his spare time in Qatar, by playing around with his little friend, named Willy, who has also set up a Twitter and Facebook page for his little companion.

Just last week the Spaniard expressed his love for his pet monkey saying: 'In this world , most animals have more feelings many human !!! I miss you my little friend.'

'Chico' made 75 appearances for Swansea after signing from Italian club Genoa and helped the club to Capital One Cup trophy success in 2013.

He said at the time of leaving the Swans: 'It feels like I am leaving my family,' Chico said.

'I have really enjoyed my time here. When we won the cup it was one of the best moments in my career.' 

It's safe to say he's really enjoying himself away from Wales too, with his monkey and lady friend no doubt the cause of it.
