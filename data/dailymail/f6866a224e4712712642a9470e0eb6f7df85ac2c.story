From the use of 'coercion and threats' to 'emotional abuse', this shocking 'checklist' for dating women was posted on Twitter by California 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc.

The diagram, featuring three sections entitled 'physical', 'violence' and 'sexual', was originally designed by a domestic abuse charity to help women identify when they are being abused.

However, the 25-year-old uploaded it to his Twitter page earlier this week, alongside the caption: 'May as well be a checklist… #HowToMakeHerStay.'

The post, which has now been hidden online, came as British politicians urged the country's Home Secretary Teresa May to ban Mr Blanc from coming to the UK.

Shocking: Self-described 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc, from California, posted this chart - designed to help women identify when they are being abused - on his Twitter page, calling it a 'checklist' for 'making her stay'

Guru: Mr Blanc (pictured in a Twitter photo) runs $3,000-a-head 'dating seminars' for men across the world

Mr Blanc is due to be in Britain on November 21 to host a seminar on pick up techniques, but an online petition calling for him to be denied entry has already attracted 120,000 signatures.

The 'dating guru' has made a name for himself by being what he describes as an 'executive coach' for the company, Real Social Dynamics, a so-called 'international leader in dating advice'.

Men from across the world pay as much as $3,000 each to attend seminars where he and his associates purport to teach how to seduce women.

But last week, Mr Blanc was forced to cut a visit to Australia short due to widespread protests at his advice, which includes choking women, threatening to commit suicide and injuring their pets.

'It's unspeakable,' Mike Burke, a 32-year-old British researcher based in Tokyo, who is a leading force in the 'Take Down Julien Blanc' Facebook campaign, told Fox News.

'He's inspiring people to commit an act that is criminal. And the misogyny is shocking.'

Criticism: The businessman had to cut his recent trip to Australia short following widespread demonstrations

Mr Burke, whose Facebook group taking on Mr Blanc has more than 9,000 followers, added that the 'pick-up artist's' seminars cross the line of free speech by inciting the audience to commit assaults.

Through his company's work, Mr Blanc promises customers the chance to 'witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations'.

But videos and pictures of the businessman in action suggest he encourages men to harass women with the aim of having sex with them.

A video of one of his seminar in Japan shows him saying that 'white men... can do what you want' in Tokyo, suggesting that men grab women's heads and thrust them towards their crotch.

Speaking of Mr Blanc's planned trip to Britain, UK crime minister, Lynne Featherstone, said she was 'extremely concerned' by his 'sexist and utterly abhorrent' comments about women.

The Liberal Democrat politician added: 'If he was allowed to perform in the UK I have no doubt that cases of sexual harassment and intimidation would increase.

'Free speech is obviously hugely important, but with free speech comes responsibility. It is not appropriate to talk about choking girls under any circumstances.'

Sarah Green, from the UK-based End Violence Against Women Coalition, agreed: 'His so-called pick up coaching promotes behavior amounting to sexual harassment and sexual assault.

Taking action: British politicians, including crime minister Lynne Featherstone (pictured), have called on the country's Home Secretary Teresa May to block Mr Blanc from being allowed to enter the UK

'More broadly, he is part of a culture which trivializes abuse of women and racism. At worst this tells victims of abuse that what has happened to them doesn't matter, and gives potential abusers the nod that such behavior will not be taken seriously.' 

A UK Home Office spokesman said: 'All visa applications are considered on their individual merits in line with the immigration rules.

'The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.'
