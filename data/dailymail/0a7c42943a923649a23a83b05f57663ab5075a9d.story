Roy Hodgson would have left Loftus Road with a warm-tingly feeling yesterday.

It had nothing to do with the mid-March sunshine, however. It was because of Tottenham striker Harry Kane.

This clash was billed as a straight shoot-out between England strike hopefuls Kane and Queens Park Rangers frontman Charlie Austin.

The Spurs striker won the battle at a canter. That's not a slight on Austin, who also would have impressed Hodgson.

But when the England manager names his squad for the games against Lithuania and Italy on Thursday, in Kane he has a striker who has every hallmark of an international footballer.

For Austin, the jury is still out.

Kane was, essentially, the difference between the two teams at QPR. It wouldn't have come as surprise to Rangers boss Chris Ramsey, who played an influential role in nurturing the striker in the White Hart Lane academy.

'He has polished himself, I was fortunate to have worked with him,' said Ramsey.

'Would I pick him for England? Yes, I would - but the way I'm going...'

Two goals against QPR took his tally for the season to 26. That's a record you simply cannot ignore.

Hodgson certainly won't. The only question for the England manager now is if he utilises the striker in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania or ease him in during the friendly against Italy.

His first goal against Rangers showed great bravery, risking a hefty blow to the head to glance home Andros Townsend's free kick.

His second showed great composure, skipping round Rob Green before finishing into an empty net.

He ticks every box. But his goals only tell part of the story.

Twice he showed excellent vision to set up marauding right-back Kyle Walker with goal scoring opportunities, executing both passes with unerring accuracy.

Had it not been for Green's heroics in Rangers' goal, Kane could easily have had four by the time Craig Pawson blew the final whistle.

After yesterday, Hodgson will be chomping at the bit to get his hands on Kane later this month.

The England boss, perhaps, won't be as eager to draft Austin into his plans.

This was by no means a poor display from the Rangers striker, who himself could easily have had four goals himself yesterday.

Likewise, his goal line clearance to deny Christian Eriksen spoke volumes for his desire and work rate.

But Kane won this battle of the future England strikers. He won it hands down.

Austin's time may come. But the time, for Kane, has arrived.
