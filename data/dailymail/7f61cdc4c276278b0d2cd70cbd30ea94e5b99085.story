Standing on their hind legs with their paws on each other's shoulders, these playful red foxes look as though they might be about to dance rather than fight.

The cubs created an almost perfect symmetry as they squared up in the morning sunshine in the wilds of Montana in order to establish the pecking order in their den.

But it did not take them long to become friends again as they were spotted cuddling each other affectionately just minutes afterwards.

Face to face: Playful red fox cubs rear up to each other during a play fight outside their den in the US state of Montana

Playful: The cubs were wrestling to create a social pecking order within their den but the fight did not last. They were soon seen cuddling up to each other affectionately

Too cute: Photographer Andrew Kandel waited by the foxes' den for 100 hours to capture beautiful images of the cubs at play

After playing together a group of cubs enjoyed a quick nap as they settled down and relaxed on their own.

The photos were taken at a den site in an old US cavalry fort from the Indian Wars of the late 19th Century.

Wildlife photographer, Andrew Kandel, 42, who took the photos said: 'The light was close to perfect and the foxes have
a nice symmetry between their bodies - they almost mirror each other.

'I saw the cubs rear up like in my image a few times previously, but either they were too far away or the light was poor.

'I knew it was an image I wanted to capture, which is what drives 
wildlife photographers to come back to a site over and over again.'

The cubs came out from their den when the sun rose and began playing together almost immediately. Andrew spent almost 100 hours at the den over a number of days in order to capture the shots.

He added: 'Out of the corner of my eye I saw two of the older cubs rearing up like I had seen previously. Red fox cubs have a lot of kitten in them and are often seen playing.

'But there is also much dominance behaviour in their play, in order to create a social pecking order.'
