Patients are being removed from a mental health hospital after a spot-check inspection found it had a 'disturbing' number of 'violent incidents'.

NHS England has stepped in to transfer all 17 patients in the 'low secure' ward at Vista Independent Hospital to other units.

Care Quality Commission inspectors found it had breached 12 national care and safety regulations when they visited in November after receiving warnings from whistleblowers and the local authority.

They demanded the hospital make immediate, urgent improvements to protect patients from abuse. 

NHS England has begun the process of moving mentally ill and vulnerable patients from Vista Hospital in Winchfield, Hampshire after it failed a care inspection, which noted a 'disturbing' number of violent incidents and the wrongful restraint of patients (file picture posed by a model)

The decision to remove some patients from the hospital in Winchfield, Hampshire, which has beds for 69, was taken last week after CQC inspectors made a return visit.

Inspectors found patients were frequently restrained, had been pinned down and injected with medication, dragged to their rooms by their armpits and had belongings taken away from them as punishment.

Some were regularly restrained in the dangerous face down 'prone' position – which can cause suffocation – but staff had a 'poor understanding' of the risk.

One senior nurse telling inspectors: 'It doesn't matter which way you take them down, front ways or back ways.'

One asthmatic patient was regularly restrained in this way but staff could 'not identify potential increased risks' of this, while a patient whose restraint was only stopped 'due to head-banging and bleeding from the nose' was not seen by a doctor.

Patients were restrained 267 times, including 55 times where they were held on the floor, between March and October 2014 but the records were inconsistent and inspectors believed the real number was higher.

The hospital had informed the CQC about police being called seven times during the period, but police had actually attended 22 times, inspectors found. 

There was a high number of 'violent incidents', including 334 involving patients and 272 incidences where staff were physically assaulted.

The CQC's report, published on January 29, said it was 'concerned' patients were not protected 'from unlawful or excessive restraint'. 

It added: 'We spoke with patients who described unsafe restraint practices.

'One person described and demonstrated how they said their arm had been hurt, putting their hands together sharply behind their back.'

Karen Wilson, CQC head of inspection, said: 'The number of violent incidents is disturbing – yet we found little evidence that the provider had the specialist skills or systems to learn from these incidents and prevent them happening in the first place.'

Although inspectors 'observed examples of calm, caring interactions' on some wards, staff were described as lacking 'understanding of patient needs'. 

They referred to patients as being 'demanding', 'attention seeking' and wanting to get their 'own way'. 

The report said: 'We were concerned about their competency to care for people safely.'

The 17 patients being removed were all on Watson Ward, a male low secure unit.

The Care Quality Commission inspection found there were not always enough staff to care for people safely and that some staff and patients said they didn't feel safe on the wards (file picture posed by models)

Vista agreed not to take on any more patients following the November inspection and brought in a new management team.

However, the CQC referred it to NHS England last week to begin removing patients from one ward after deadlines it set for improvement passed. 

A spokesman for NHS England said: 'Vista Healthcare has failed to maintain safe standards of care and treatment for the vulnerable patients in its care. 

'The first priority for all NHS commissioners is to make sure that all patients currently at Vista Healthcare are safe and well cared for.

'Commissioners, working with the Care Quality Commission have acted promptly and already begun the process of transferring these patients, some with complex needs, to centres that can provide care to the appropriate standards.

'NHS England supports the enforcement action taken by the Care Quality Commission, and will continue to work with partners in monitoring the progress of all actions required of Vista Healthcare.'

Vista Healthcare said its new team was working 'to ensure that the highest levels of patient welfare and safety are restored'.

It said CQC and NHS England had 'temporarily suspended our ability to care for low secure male patients', and it would work closely with both bodies 'to implement the improvements we all agree necessary'.
