As a boy he watched the Royal Marines arrive in war-torn Kosovo, their sights set on ending Slobodan Milosevic's persecution of ethnic Albanians.

It was then that 14-year-old Arben Islami made a promise to himself -Â  one day he would wear the green beret.

Fourteen years later and the former refugee, who fled his home alone, has achieved his dream.

Fourteen years after he fled his home in Kosovo, Arben Islami, 28, has achieved his dream of becoming a Royal Marine Reservist. He said watching the Marines arrive in Kosovo in 1999, as part of the NATO force to counter Slobodan Milosevic's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which controlled the country before the war

The 28-year-old has joined the Royal Marines as a reservist, passing out as a commando last month.

Marine Islami was granted British citizenship in July 2012. The next day he signed up and joined the 350-year-old Marine Corps.

Marine Islami fled Kosovo shortly after seeing the first NATO troops arrive in 1999.

He said: 'As children we saw the marines in Kosovo and I knew I wanted to be one of them. Then I fled and came to the UK.

'I
 didn't have the intention at the time as I was only just a young kid 
but when I got indefinite leave to stay here and became British I knew I
 had to.

'I wanted to join up and give something back to the country that helped me so much.'

When Marine Islami arrived in the UK he was placed in foster care in Birmingham. There he learned English and went to school.

At the age of 14, Arben Islami fled his home alone, travelling to the UK hoping to find an uncle. He was taken into foster care in Birmingham. In July 2012 he was granted British citizenship and a day later he signed up to join the Royal Marine Corps. He has now passed out as a reservist and also works as a bricklayer

British paratroopers advance into Kosovo in June 1999

Around 140 British troops with 15 Warrior combat vehicles, enter Kosovska Mitrovica in Kosovo, in early 2000. The troops provided reinforcement to the French soldiers already in control of the divided city

He said he has not stepped foot in Kosovo since, and has no plans to return.

After signing up and completing 10 weeks of training at the Commando Training Centre in Lympstine, Devon, Mr Islami proposed to his girlfriend Anita.

He put his dreams of becoming a green beret on hold, providing for his family and working as a bricklayer.

Marine Islami said: 'I wanted to join up and give something back to the country that helped me'

But some 18 months later, he took up his quest to become a reservist.

He completed the notoriously difficult Commando Course and went on to successfully complete the four Commando tests, which culminate in a 30-mile speed march across Dartmoor.

He said: 'I'm very honoured to be 
part of the corps, and I just can't express my happiness enough. I 
always knew it was going to be a challenge, that I would be pushed to my
 limits and that is why I wanted to join.

'It
 is a huge privilege, particularly coming from another country, to join 
the Royal Marines because they are one of the best forces in the world.'

Marine Islami has now returned to work as a bricklayer and continues to train with the Royal Marine Reserves.

He said he hopes to deploy with 3 Commando Brigade, the UK's amphibious infantry, in the future.

Now settled in the UK as a British citizen, he said he looked forward to a promising future with his family.

'You've got so many opportunities in England it would be a shame to waste them,' he added. 'You can be anything you want.'

Kosovo is the disputed land which lies on the border of Serbia and Albania.

War broke out there in February 1998 when forces under Yugoslav President Solbodan Milosevic tried to suppress an campaign for independence by the ethnic Albanians in the country. Fighting continuted in the region until June 1999.

Serbs and ethnic Albanians had fought for control of the area in for decades.

Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic became the first serving head of state to be indicted for crimes against humanity, by the International War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague

Despite being in the minority, Kosovo was of huge historic and emotional importance for Serbs, who considered the region the heart of their culture, religion and national identity.

In 1974 the Yugoslav constitution cemented Kosovo as an autonomous province of Serbia.But pressure for independence mounted in the 1980s after the death of President Josip Broz Tito.

In 1987 Milosevic was sent to Kosovo and seized the region, promising Serbians 'no one will dare to beat you again', in a televised statement.

Two years later he became Yugoslav president, heralding the rise of Serbian nationalism.In the mid-1990s the Albanian rebels, the Kosovo Liberation Army stepped up its attacks on Serbian targets.

By the summer of 1998 mass protests were breaking out, demonstrating at Serbian rule.Police and Army reinforcements were sent into the region to try to destroy the rebel KLA.A deal to end the crisis - negotiated by the international community in 1999 - was rejected by Milosevic.

His continued persecution of the Albanians prompted NATO to intervene, launching air strikes against targets in Kosovo and Serbia in March of that year.

At the same time a campaign of ethnic cleansing targeting Kosovo Albanians began.

Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians fled Kosovo during the war, seeking refuge in Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro

Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled across the border to Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro.After 11 weeks of Nato bombings, Milosevic was forced to withdraw his troops.

Around 750,000 Albanian refugees returned home, while around 100,000 Serbs fled.

The UN was put in charge, until agreement could be reached on whether Kosovo would become indepdent or revert to Serbian control.

In May 1999 Milosevic became the first serving head of state to be indicted for crimes against humanity, by the international war crimes tribunal at The Hague.

The indictment listed six specific charges of crimes against humanity, detailing the massacres of ethnic Albanians across the region.

Later that year, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe undertook an investigation, interviewing 3,000 witnesses.

It uncovered accounts of murder, rape and mutilation carried out by Serbs.

Milosevic's trial got underway in 2002. By the time he died in March 2006 the prosecution had concluded its case but the defence was in progress.

The court could not establish legally what had happened in Kosovo.
