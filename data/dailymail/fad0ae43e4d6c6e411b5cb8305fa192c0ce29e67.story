David Cameron has taken us into yet another of his kitchens to convince the nation he should be the next Prime Minister - and let slip while preparing a salad that he would he would not seek a third term in office

Mr Cameron was interviewed while preparing dinner with his wife Samantha in his £1million constituency home near Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds, surrounded by expensive gadgets.

Viewers urged the Prime Minister to 'tidy up' the 'cluttered' kitchen, which holds a £240 food processor, £250 speakers, a £650 Range cooker and a £2,000 fridge freezer, all illuminated by  £22 Ikea ceiling lights.

A look inside the plush kitchen also revealed that the Prime Minister appears to have a £16.99 'Calm Down Dear' chopping board - a reference to a sexism row after he used the phrase in response to noisy heckles from Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle. 

Labour’s Ed Miliband was also interviewed in his sparse kitchen recently and mocked when it turned out that it was one of two.

Joke: A look inside the plush kitchen also revealed that the Prime Minister appears to have a 'Calm Down Dear' chopping board - a reference to a sexism row after he used the phrase in response to noisy heckles from Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle.

In a lengthy BBC profile, Mr Cameron prepared dinner with deputy political editor James Landale, who asked him directly whether he would go for a third term if he remained Prime Minister. Mr Cameron replied: ‘No, I think I’m standing for a full second term.

‘I’m not saying all Prime Ministers necessarily, definitely go mad, or even go mad at the same rate, but I feel I’ve got more to bring to this job, the job is half done, the economy’s turned round, the deficit is half down and I want to finish the job.’

Mr Cameron said political leaders should never regard themselves as indispensable. Asked whether his ‘posh’ background was an issue with voters, Mr Cameron insisted: ‘The British public see through all that. The judgment they are making is “Can you do the job or not”.’

He also paid tribute to his wife Samantha for keeping him ‘sane’ in Downing Street and he revealed she will be playing a role in the Conservative election campaign.

His wife said: ‘I hope me and the children help him keep things in perspective, keep him grounded, help him pace himself over the next eight weeks.’

Past: David Cameron invited the cameras into his kitchen in Oxfordshire in 2006 - and commenters said that it now looks a lot more cluttered

Britons have started calling the 2015 General Election to 'kitchen election', with David Cameron and Ed Miliband both choosing to be interviewed in their homes.

News that Ed Miliband had two kitchens in his North London mansion led to him being lampooned and faced accusations that he was out of touch. 

It began after he and wife Justine were filmed for a BBC interview having tea in a very small, empty room with no seating area.

In response to criticism, a family friend tweeted that the main kitchen in the Milibands’ £2million North London home was ‘lovely’ and that this was merely a ‘functional kitchenette for tea and snacks’. 

David Cameron has also disclosed that - like Ed Miliband - he has two kitchens in his London home.

But the Prime Minister said he had the second kitchen installed in his house in Notting Hill for the benefit of the carers who looked after his disabled son Ivan, who died in 2009.

Labour leader Ed Miliband previously allowed the cameras into his 'second kitchen' - an area for snack-making in his north London home

Man about the house: Mr Cameron rustles up a quick lunch of sardines and mayonnaise on toast in the modern kitchen of his Downing Street flat last week. The American-style steel fridge is covered with family photos and magnetic letters while the shelves house a mug collection and gleaming saucepans

Tidying up: The PM at his Downing Street fridge with some wine on show. There's another bottle on the bench. The larder stores olive oils, condiments and - surprisingly - what seems to be salad

Mr Cameron said: ‘We actually had to extend into the basement and we put in an extra kitchen, not least because I had a very disabled son, Ivan, and his carers were there and they looked after him and so we did that for them as well has for him.

‘The point is not whether you have got two kitchens, but whether you have a photocall in one of them and pretend it’s your kitchen. That’s the issue.’

The interview was part of the American website’s BuzzFeed Brews series that usually sees people answer questions over a beer.

Mr Cameron dressed down for the event in front of trendy advertising and new media types by wearing an open-necked shirt, but he declined an alcoholic drink and instead sipped water during the interview in central London.
