A married woman from Reston, Virginia, was arrested late on Saturday night after she tried to visit her husband in jail while she was naked and drunk.

Maura Fussell, 26, has been charged with indecent exposure and being drunk in public.

Police believe that Fussell and her husband, who hasn’t been named, had earlier that day participated in a St Patrick’s Day event in Arlington.

The Shamrock Crawl was advertised as Arlington’s largest bar crawl and was held from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m.

Police say Fussell's husband was arrested at some point on Saturday, though Arlington police spokesman Dustin Sternbeck was not sure what he was charged with, reports ARLNow.com.

Then at around 11p.m., Fussell arrived at the Arlington County Jail naked and drunk and demanded to see her husband.

The woman ‘was given several opportunities to put her clothes back on,’ Sternbeck said, ‘exit the magistrate’s office and go home in a cab. But she refused and took the charges’ which meant spending the night in the county jail.

Sternbeck was unable to say whether Fussell arrived at the office wearing clothes and subsequently removed them, or whether she arrived there naked.

Men and women are not jointly housed in the Arlington jail, or pretty much any jail, so there was no joyous reunion in the drunk tank, although the couple were both released the next day,

Sternbeck said that during pub crawls around Arlington, ‘our officers frequently give these people an opportunity to take a cab. They frequently don’t want to do that.’
