Silhan Ozcelik, of Holloway, north London, was arrested at Stansted Airport after she arrived on a flight from Germany on January 16

A teenage girl who allegedly ran away from home to fight against Isis in Syria has appeared in court on terrorism charges.  

Silhan Ozcelik, of Holloway, north London, was arrested at Stansted Airport after she arrived on a flight from Germany on January 16.

The 18-year-old is accused of travelling by Eurostar from St Pancras to Brussels on October 27 and then attempting to join the guerrilla army in the Kurdistan Workers' Party - known as the PKK - which is fighting against IS in Syria.

The PKK is proscribed by UK authorities as a terrorist group.

Ozcelik faces one charge of engaging in conduct in preparation for giving effect to an intention to commit acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5 (1) (a) of the Terrorism Act 2006.

Ozcelik is accused of travelling to Belgium on the 8:58 Eurostar from St Pancras International on October 27th last year, the same day she was reported missing by her family.

The headquarters of the PKK's youth movement is in Stuggart, Germany, the court heard.

Wearing a black and cream coat, blue shirt and black trousers, she spoke only to confirm her name, age and address during the short hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court.

District Judge John Zani remanded her in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on April 1. 

As she was led away from the dock she smiled and appeared to mouth 'It's okay' to her brother, who followed proceedings from the public gallery.

The Kurdistan Workers’s Party (PKK) is a Kurdish rebel organisation founded in 1978, originally fighting for self-determination and political rights for Kurds in Turkey.

More recently PKK have been fighting to relieve Kurdish enclaves, such as Kobani in Syria, which has come under attack from ISIS.

PKK is listed as a terrorist organisation by NATO, the United States and the European Union.

Remanding Ozcelik in custody, Judge John Zani said: ‘This case now proceeds to the Central Criminal Court and you will appear there on the 1 April where the judge will no doubt want to make progress.

‘These allegations are clearly very serious although I appreciate this is just an accusation.’
