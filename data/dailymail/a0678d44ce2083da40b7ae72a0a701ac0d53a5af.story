Matt Taylor will miss Burnley’s Premier League clash with his old club West Ham at Turf Moor on Saturday after being sent for surgery on an achilles problem.

The 32-year-old midfielder left the Hammers on a free transfer in the summer and played in Burnley’s first four games of the season, but has not appeared since the goalless draw with Manchester United in August.

The club’s medical staff hoped that rest would cure the condition but manager Sean Dyche revealed that Taylor is booked in for an operation on Monday.

‘Matty Taylor unfortunately is going to have a minor operation,’ said Dyche. ‘He’s got a niggling achilles and it just hasn’t settled down.

‘We’re not sure how long he will be out for. We’ll know more after the operation but we’re hopeful that he’ll go in Monday.

‘It’s nothing too serious in the grand scheme of things, just something that’s niggling. It’s a small bony area at the back of his achilles which is irritating it, so that’s going to have to be done.

‘I always follow surgical opinion. That was the opinion to allow it time to settle down, but it just hasn’t settled to the level that you need to carry on what you’re doing. So we leave that one with the surgeons, that’s what they’re paid for.’

There was better news on the injury front for Dyche regarding five other players, including last season’s 26-goal top scorer Danny Ings who could return to action against West Ham.

Ings has missed the last three games with a hamstring strain and Dyche said: ‘He’s had a good week with us so he’s certainly in the thinking which we’re pleased about.

‘He’s managed to get on the grass at the beginning of the week as well which is important because he’s fit to train with the group rather than throw him in at the last minute. We just thought it was important to give him a full week’s training so he definitely comes into the thinking.’

Kieran Trippier is fit despite being carried off with an ankle injury in the 2-2 draw at Leicester last time out, and David Jones, Nathaniel Chalobah and Michael Keane should all be available.

The match at Turf Moor comes too soon for forward Sam Vokes, who is recovering from a serious knee injury

However, Sam Vokes is still not ready to return while Steven Reid and Dean Marney are unlikely to be fit to face West Ham.

‘Vokes is going really well,’ added Dyche. ‘There have been some remarks in the papers about him trying to be fit in a month, and I don’t think that’s the case. You never know but he’s going along really well.

‘There will certainly be no pressure from us. We want to make sure he’s right, fit and well in his own time.’
