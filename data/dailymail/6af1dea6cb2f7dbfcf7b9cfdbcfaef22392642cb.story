There may have been a deliberate effort by both clubs to kill the poison on the streets, but such pacifism certainly did not extend to the pitch as a fiery Tyne-Wear derby was won at the death by Sunderland’s Adam Johnson.

The fans – in a joint tribute to the two Newcastle fans killed in the MH17 disaster – had applauded each other. The players, meanwhile, kicked each other.

Had it not been for Johnson’s 90th-minute intervention – his third straight goal at St James’ Park – then this derby would have been defined by the seven yellow cards issued by Anthony Taylor.

There were reports of police having to separate rival fans before the game, but it was Mr Taylor who very quickly took on the role of law enforcer inside the ground.

That the game expired with 22 men on the pitch owed a little to his strict handling of a ferocious first half, but also to his leniency after the break.

Lee Cattermole took just 30 seconds to make his mark on the contest – and Daryl Janmaat – with a robust block which upended the Newcastle defender.

It was a cute – if cynical – tactic, for Taylor was never going to produce a card at such a juvenile juncture.

Fast forward 60 seconds, however, and Sebastian Coates was not so fortunate, his chop on Ayoze Perez drawing the game’s first yellow.

Fabricio Coloccini joined him eight minutes later when his studs landed in the back of Steven Fletcher – the same Steven Fletcher who has been carrying a back injury of late.

The skipper was booked but, had such an obvious offence occurred the other side of half-time, it may well have been a red card.

Of all the candidates to see red then perhaps Magpie midfielder Cheick Tiote ranked at the top of the list. That he collected his caution for such a needless climb over Connor Wickham served to highlight his favouritism in such a market – it also landed him with a one-game ban.

Former Black Cats man Jack Colback was next into Taylor’s notebook when his high boot floored Jordi Gomez. Cattermole sensed blood – and the red residing in the referee’s pocket – and duly threw himself to the floor under minimal contact from Colback moments later. His former team-mate wasn’t best pleased and Taylor wasn’t impressed either.

Neither was the whistler enamoured by Sunderland winger Wickham when he clattered into Jak Alnwick as the rookie goalkeeper came to fist clear inside the six-yard area. The upshot: yellow.

Colback, though, was fortunate to stay on the field moments later when, having tripped Larsson as he scampered clear down the left, Taylor chose to penalise Coloccini for an earlier infringement – it kept the contest at 11 apiece heading into the break.

Cattermole – a surprise absentee from Taylor’s pad to this point – became the sixth player in the book when, having been outsprinted by Perez, he took a very deliberate swipe to ground the Spaniard. He failed, but the intent was enough.

There was no doubting O’Shea’s entry soon after, the visiting captain scything down Sissoko with the midfielder in full flight by the touchline.

His opposite number Coloccini should have been dismissed for a trip which felled Will Buckley, but a crowd of bodies saved the Argentine.

Newcastle defender Paul Dummett had escaped caution but, as Johnson skipped forward in the last minute, perhaps he wishes he’d taken the winger out on halfway.

Ten seconds later and Johnson was smashing the winning goal to spark mass celebration high in the Leazes End for the third season in a row.
