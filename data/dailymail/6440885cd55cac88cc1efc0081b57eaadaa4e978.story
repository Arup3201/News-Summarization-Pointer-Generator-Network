Just a few weeks ago, Sam Faiers told us she had some exciting modelling work in the pipeline and she wasn't lying.

The former TOWIE star, who left the ITV2 show that rocketed her to fame in April, has just been unveiled as the face and incredibly toned body of Ann Summer's new range.

As the first celebrity campaign the brand has launched in recent years, Ann Summers said that with her stunning figure, fun, fearless attitude and fashion business credentials, not only is she the perfect fit for the Sexy For You campaign, she is the only woman for the job.

She's come a long way from TOWIE! Sam Faiers, who shot to fame on The Only Way Is Essex, has seen her career go from strength to strength after leaving the show behind. Her latest coup? Showcasing her enviable physique for Ann Summers

Sam, 23, models the new collection, which lands in store on July 21 and includes four staple bra shapes available in sizes 32A-38G, to perfection.

Speaking about her exciting new campaign, Sam said: 'I’m so excited to be working with Ann Summers - I’ve always been a huge fan of the brand, and I’ve shopped for my lingerie there for years.

'As the first celeb face that Ann Summers has worked with for a long-time, I’m really looking forward to seeing the response to the campaign.

'I love the imagery - we had a lot of fun on the shoot, and I’m really pleased with the results. The Sexy Lace collection is perfect to take you through from day to night - practical enough that you can wear under your work clothes but still sexy enough to flaunt.

Taking the plunge: Speaking about her exciting new campaign, Sam said she's always been a huge fan of the brand and loves the plunging design the most

'The four different bra shapes mean there’s a style to suit everyone - my favourite is the plunge, as it gives me great cleavage and support.'

Jacqueline Gold, CEO of Ann Summers said: 'I am delighted that Sam has come on board to work with us - she is a great ambassador for the brand, and an excellent fit for the campaign.

'Sam has a wide following from TOWIE and CBB, a demographic that we know to be switched on to our brand. With her fantastic figure I think she is the perfect person to front this campaign for us - I know our customers are going to love the collection.'

Since leaving the bright lights of Brentwood behind, Sam has starred on Celebrity Big Brother (CBB), been 
snapped up by countless beauty brands, seen Minnie's Boutique - the shop
 she owns with her sister - become a success and even landed herself a 
top modelling contract.

FEMAIL caught up with Sam to find out 
her beauty secrets, summer style tips and plans for the future - which 
is most certainly looking bright.

Sharing her summer 
style tips, Sam said: 'I think you can be more daring on holiday. I'm 
loving pastel colours, crop tops and little dainty pieces of jewellery.'

Perfect fit: Sam says she's thrilled to front the new Sexy For You campaign, which sees her modelling an array of underwired and padded bras

When it comes to beachside beauty, 
Sam says she loves to keep in natural and 'doesn't wear a scrap of 
make-up' in the day and loves to 'scruff her hair into a bun'.

With
 a manic schedule, Sam says she hasn't had time to work out 'as much as 
she'd like to' but says that when she does exercise, she focuses on 
toning and not cardio.

'I don't have a lot of weight to shed so I just do lots of lunges, squats and use kettle bells,' she explained.

As
 for the future, Sam says she has 'loads of things' going on. She told 
us: 'I have lots of exciting things planned with my modelling agency, 
Elite, for the summer, and have been talking to some TV companies but 
I'll make sure I choose the right thing for me.'
