Starving scavengers forced to the brink by the recession are targeting sheep in a remote beauty spot and butchering them in fields for their meat, livestock protection officers fear.

Experts have reported that animals are being dismembered on Dartmoor, Devon - or stolen alive to be killed later.

Karla McKechnie, Dartmoor Livestock Protection Officer, said: 'We’ve found sheep where joints like the leg and shoulder have been carefully cut away. They’re the sort of joints you’d have in a roast dinner.

'I saw another killed which had all its legs removed.

'I don’t know where this is going - but there are people out there who will do this for the meat.'

She said people in nearby Plymouth have also reported waking up and finding sheep in their back garden.

Gory: Karla McKechnie, Livestock Protection Officer, Dartmoor Livestock Protection Society found carcasses with joints, such as the leg and shoulder, carefully cut away - 'the sort of joints you¿d have in a roast dinner'

'We think they’ve been taken home so that people can butcher them there - and then have lost heart and don’t fancy doing it - or the sheep are getting away,' said Mrs McKechnie.

'Maybe it’s because times are hard.

'It’s very worrying - we will watch this space.'

The main thrust of the livestock protection officer’s work on Dartmoor is to prevent pet dogs from making a nuisance of themselves - and Mrs McKechnie has witnessed some horrific scenes during her first year in the job.

'There’s a pretty serious problem with dogs on the moors,' she says.

'This year alone there were 41 recorded dog attacks - 20 of those logged with the police.

'Some of the time dog owners say "It’s only playing - it doesn’t mean any harm," after it has chased a sheep half a mile leaving its lamb behind.

'Dogs don’t actually have to attack the animal - abortions are high in sheep.

'And even if it’s only slightly got hold of a sheep, dog bites are nasty and the wounds will go septic.'

Gruesome: Many of the sheep were relieved of their best meat joints with butcher-like precission

Earlier this year Dartmoor Livestock Protection Society gave evidence to the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee - and the organisation is pressing for the national park authority to take a much greater role in patrolling hot-spot areas, particularly near Plymouth, and prosecuting dog owners whose pets are out of control.
