She may not have been as famous as Barbara Cartland.

But on the longevity front, Mills & Boon writer Ida Pollock has earned her place in history.

The world’s oldest author, she has died aged 105 – just weeks before the publication of her 125th novel.

Ida Pollock, 105, has been hailed as the world's oldest romantic novelist

Mrs Pollock sold millions of books over 
the course of more than nine decades. At one point she produced 40 books
 in five years – and once claimed she could finish a novel in six weeks.

Born
 in Lewisham, south London, she finished her first book at the age of 
14. In the 1930s she decided to become a full-time author, penning a 
string of hits using the name Joan Allen.

By 1956 she had published eight romances under five pen names – each around 70,000 words long.

Mrs
 Pollock went on to use ten pseudonyms and saw 70 of her books published
 by Mills & Boon under the names Pamela Kent, Rose Burghley, Susan 
Barrie and Mary Whistler.

Many of her dashing male heroes were modelled 
on her late husband Colonel Hugh Pollock, a decorated veteran who was 
previously married to Enid Blyton.

Earlier this year Ida said: 'A romance is never just a romance, there's adventure, mystery and movement.

Prolific: Ida passion-fuelled tales have made hearts flutter for nine decades

Passion: Ida sold over a million books in her prolific career - over half through Mills & Boon - with titles such as White Heat and Interlude for Love

Ida has millions of fans but has largely avoided the limelight by writing under ten different pseudonyms

'You
 need a grand, dramatic setting - the Swiss Alps were always an personal
 favourite of mine - and a chance meeting, on a train, a cruise, or 
perhaps the hero and heroine find themselves shipwrecked on a desert 
island.

'The men are normally rich, well-to-do
 - but never vulgar with their money. Young men lack the maturity to 
take control so an older man is essential to provide the reassurance the
 heroine's needs.

'There's always a fair amount of turbulence before he sweeps in to save the day. A happy ending is an absolute must.'

With her advancing years, Ida stopped using a typewriter, and instead dictated her racy tales to daughter Rosemary at their remote country home in 
Lanreath near Looe, Cornwall.

Rosemary, 70, said 
her mother was a ‘national treasure’. She added: ‘Again and again, 
readers would write to say she’d cheered them up. Her books were more 
than happy endings, they were full of life, energy and optimism.’

be based on Ida's late husband, Hugh Pollock (left) who was also married

Ida only released a handful of 
books under her own name and until this year published under name of the last of her 
alter-egos, Marguerite Bell.

A Distant Drum, her most recent 
novel, in which a young Fanny Templeton falls for the Marquis of Ordley 
after clashing at the battle of Waterloo, came out in 2005.

Ida's
 memoirs, Starlight, were published in 2009 and her most recent works are two more Regency 
romances, including her latest, The Runaway, which will be published in 2014.

The Runaway is the story of a young woman who inherits a vast fortune and is forced to flee to escape several suitors.

Ida, who was also a celebrated artist and
 illustrator, said earlier this year that it would take her about six 
weeks to write a novel.

The mother-of one, who is also a celebrated 
artist and illustrator, released up to eight novels in one year at her 
busiest time. Ida, pictured a home in Cornwall (left) and stepping out 
in the 1980s (right), said earlier this year that it takes her around six weeks to write a 
novel

Ida has sold millions of books over nine decades of writing

Ida said in an interview in April this year: 'I think I was born to write. My mother would put a typewriter on the dining room table and say "there you go".

'My
 first story was published in the Christian Herald and they would pay me
 five guineas. I wrote my first novel when I was just 14.

'I
 was into mysteries and thrillers at the time but I eventually I drifted
 into romance because my mother would always ask me to write "something 
pretty".

'I've never got bored of it because its something I absolutely love. My books are full of hope and romance rather than sex.

'They are a form of escapism - you can escape the parts of the world that you don't like.'

Ida Pollock's writing desk in the early 1990s

Unmarried daughter Rosemary, an editor and writer, has followed in her mother's footsteps and written a number of romantic novels herself.

She
 said: 'Pen names are very common in romance writing. Mum's publishers 
always insisted on them because readers associated different styles with
 different names.

'I don't 
think she's ever quite got the recognition she deserves. I've always 
loved her books and I would read them over and over, especially in my 
teens.

'I think her passion for writing is what has kept her going so long. She's remarkable - a national treasure'.

Ida's funeral will take place in the coming days in Lanreath, where Ida lived and where she will also be buried.

Dame Barbara Cartland, who died aged 98 in 2000, is said to have written over 700 books.

Nightingale in the Sycamore (1957)'He moved to meet her as she moved to meet him and caught her in his arms, kissing her wildly, like a man who was starving. Her hair, eyes, cheeks, lips - he smothered them with so many kisses that before long he paused to draw breath himself. She was completely breathless, but clung to him as if never willingly would she let him go again, and for the first time for weeks she knew what it was to feel glad that she had been born. . . .'Bay of Moonlight (1968)'Their first kiss was unlike anything Sarah had ever expected of a kiss. It left her feeling as if a thunderbolt had come hurtling out of the sky and passed so close that it scorched her. And when his violent mood changed to one of gentleness, a tenderness that melted her bones, she knew that this was the moment for which she had been destined ... It was the very purpose of her life ...'A Distant Drum (2005)'She had been in bed no more than five minutes when she heard the door handle begin to turn. The movement was gentle at first. "Open this door, or I'll break it down," the Marquis ordered. When there was no immediate response his fist began pounding against the woodwork, and Fanny jumped out of bed. "I don't," his lordship told her, "wish to rouse the whole house, but if it becomes necessary I shall not hesitate to do so. Turn the key in the lock, Fanny.'
