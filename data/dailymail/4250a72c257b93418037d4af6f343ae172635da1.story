A young woman suffered severe burns after a flaming Sambuca cocktail 'exploded' in her face in a bar in the early hours of the morning.

Eyewitnesses said the 24-year-old's 'face caught fire' in the 'freak accident' in Lola's cocktail lounge in Manchester city centre which actively promote their fiery drinks.

She sustained burns to her cheeks, forehead and chest and was rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital's burns unit after being treated with morphine.

Drinkers around the world have been accidentally set on fire by flaming cocktails in bars.

The 24-year-old woman in Manchester is still in hospital recovering today after being set alight by sambuca.

The case comes after a Russian man suffered severe burns in May after a barman set fire to his head while trying to pour a glass of flaming absinthe into his mouth. Alexey Ponamarev, 28, was rushed to hospital with burns to his face after the incident in a bar in Novosibirsk, south-west Siberia.

Four years ago British tourist Stuart Feltham (pictured) was turned into a human fireball when his genitals were apparently set alight by a woman in Malia, Greece.

Marina Fanouraki, 26, claimed that the holidaymaker, 20, had sexually assaulted her.

In 2010, bartender Albert Trummer was arrested in Manhattan, USA, by undercover fire marshalls after setting liquors alight in a bar trick.

The management at the 'Miami-style
cocktail lounge' said they are reviewing health and safety procedures 
following the incident in the early hours of Sunday.

Flaming
Sambuca shots are made by pouring the spirit into a glass over two of 
three coffee beans. They are set alight and the alcohol burns with a 
pale blue flame

The flames should then be extinguished and drinkers inhale the fumes from the glass before downing it.

The idea of the
drink is that by setting it alight, the coffee flavour infuses into the Sambuca.

A spokeswoman for the North West 
Ambulance Service NHS Trust confirmed it received a report of a woman 
with her 'face on fire' at 1.54am on Sunday. Paramedics were at the 
scene in under five minutes.

An ambulance service spokesman said: 'A female suffered significant facial burns.'

Reports from eyewitnesses on social media suggested the woman was at the bar with a friend when her hair caught fire.

A
spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said they were investigating 
the incident. However, it is thought to have been an accident.

The woman remains in hospital today.

In
promotional material, Lola's bar have written that they offer 
cocktail-making classes where you can 'get a chance to make your own 
cocktails and learn about the history of each... even play with fire!'

A
spokesman for Lola's said: 'Following the recent event in our venue 
resulting in injury to one of our customers, we sincerely offer our 
sympathies for her injuries sustained.

'We
have been trading for many years and have never had another incident 
such as this and we have revisited our health and safety procedures once
again to prevent this type of freak accident from happening again.'
