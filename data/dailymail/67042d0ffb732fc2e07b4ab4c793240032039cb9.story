Chelsea have been approached about a £15million deal for Nigeria striker Emmanuel Emenike from Fenerbahce. 

The forward played a pivotal role in his country's run to the last 16 before they were defeated 2-0 by France on Monday.

The 27-year-old won the Turkish Super Lig with Fener last season scoring 12 goals in 28 league appearances.

Elsewhere the Blues have agreed a two-year deal with Tiago Mendes.

The 33-year-old is joining as a free agent after his contract ran out with Atletico Madrid.

The Portuguese made 23 La Liga appearances for the recently-crowned Spanish champions last season and returns to Stamford Bridge after nine years away.

He spent just one season with Chelsea before leaving for Lyon in 2005.

However, his 12 months with the Blues were certainly successful - in total he won three trophies: the Community Shield, the League Cup and the Premier League, scoring four goals in 34 league appearances.
