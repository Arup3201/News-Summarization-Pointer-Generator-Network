The sister of a trainee nurse who died in a hen party crash has blamed the 'idiotic actions' of their minibus driver for taking away her 'best friend'.

Amy Firth, 26, was one of 20 women travelling to the hen party in Liverpool when their minibus was hit on the M62 in West Yorkshire by an articulated lorry.

Her 18-year-old sister Bethany Jones was killed, while bride-to-be Stefanie Firth, 24, were among several others injured.

Amy Firth, pictured left at her sister's funeral, told Leeds Crown Court she had lost her sister and best friend Bethany Jones, right, because of the 'idiotic actions' of a minibus driver  taking them to a hen party in Liverpool

Today, in a statement read to a jury at Leeds Crown Court, Ms Firth told the jury she believed bus driver James Johnson caused the incident.

His 24-seat Mercedes minibus began showing signs of mechanical error due to a burnt-out clutch just minutes into the hen party journey on April 26 last year, the court heard. 

She said: 'That short journey changed my life and that of my family. My sister and best friend Beth was taken from me by the idiotic actions of that minibus driver.'

The jury heard how the group left from South Elmsall, West Yorkshire, for a weekend in Liverpool ahead of the wedding.

As soon as the minibus got on to the A1, the group started to smell burning. They forced the driver to stop to check his vehicle.

Mr Johnson,64, stopped in a lay by on the A1 before they got onto the motorway, but he set off again after a cursory check, the court heard. 

By the time the minibus had moved on to the M62 it slowed to a crawl, the court was told.

Ms Firth said the minibus driver 'should never have carried on driving' with the vehicle in that condition. 

She described in her statement how other vehicles were honking their horns at them because the bus was going so slow.

The women asked the minibus driver to pull over after smelling burning, but he carried on with the journey after a cursory check and began crawling at no more than 5mph on the M62, the court heard

Other vehicles avoided colliding with the minibus but Kevin Ollerhead, who was driving the lorry on a cruise control set to 52mph, drove straight into the back of the bus, Leeds Crown Court heard 

Other vehicles avoided colliding with the coach but Ollerhead, who was driving the lorry on a cruise control set to 52mph, drove straight into the back of the bus, the court was told.

Ms Firth said: 'I knew the speed on the motorway was dangerous.

'The next thing I remember was waking up and the bus being laid on its side.

'I started shouting "our Beth". I continued shouting "our Beth" but got no reply. I was shouting to mum, "I can't hear our Beth".'

She said she was 'crying and screaming' at the time. 

Her mother, Diane Jones, told the court in a statement how the hen party revellers were 'laughing and joking' and were 'very excited' before they set off.

Lorry driver Kevin Ollerhead, left, denies causing Mrs Jones's death. James Johnson, right, who was driving the hen party's minibus, has pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving 

Mrs Jones said she heard a sound she would 'describe as an explosion' while on the M62. 

She said she was trapped inside the stricken minibus and could hear daughter Amy shouting. She could not hear Bethany.

The court also heard from several other passengers, one of whom told the jury: 'I think he stopped and got out to stop us nagging.' 

Mr Johnson from Wyke, Bradford, pleaded guilty to causing Miss Jones's death by dangerous driving at an earlier hearing, the jury has heard.

Bride-to-be Stefanie Firth, 24, was among those who were seriously injured

Truck driver Kevin Ollerhead, 45, from St Helens, Merseyside, is on trial charged with the same offence. He denies causing death by dangerous driving.

Bryan Cox QC, opening the case for the prosecution yesterday, told the jury of eight women and four men that the collision happened after the 24-seater coach suffered mechanical problems and came to a 'near standstill' on the motorway.

Other vehicles avoided the coach but Ollerhead, who was driving the lorry on a cruise control set to 52mph, drove straight into the back of the bus.

It shunted it 50 yards along the road where it careered into a crash barrier, the court heard.  

Mr Cox told the jury the speed of the coach gradually reduced to a 'snail's pace' until it was travelling at just 5.5mph in the nearside lane of the M62, just after junction 32, near Pontefract.

The prosecution claimed that even thought his articulated lorry was on the speed limiter, he still had around six seconds to see the stricken bus in front of him, after several other vehicles had overtaken it.

The jury was told that there were no indications that he had either braked or tried to steer away from the coach as he travelled towards it in the motorway's inside lane at 52 mph. 

Johnson will be sentenced following Ollerhead's trial, which is expected to last ten days. 

The trial continues.
