French police have confiscated and stored such a large quantity of cannabis that the smell is causing officers to fail drug tests.

There is so much of the seized substance in the air that those working in the station in the city of Roubaix have also complained of nausea and headaches.

More than 40kg of the drug has been stored in the building and the aroma has now spread to two floors.

Confiscated: The 40kg of cannabis that was seized by officers in the northern city of Roubaix

Fabrice Danel, a local police union official told French newspaper NordEclair: 'My colleagues are really fed up. They are complaining of nausea, headaches.

'Some, either worried or for fun, tested themselves for cannabis. Most of them came back positive. Itâ€™s a scandal!'

The smell prompted a meeting between officials last week, but so far they have not found a way to eradicate the problem.

The confiscated narcotics would normally be removed from the station, but a bureaucratic feud between police commissioners and the agency responsible for disposing of the drug means it has not been possible.

A judge has become concerned with the situation and says there could be serious repercussions if one of the officers was tested on the streets. 

One judicial official said: 'Imagine that an officer, on duty or simply going home, causes an accident.

'A field test would show him positive for drugs and he would be arrested.

'I imagine a blood test would come back negative, but the officer would end up being labelled corrupt.'
