Reclining in the water with his feet raised in the air this grizzly bear cub bears an uncanny resemblance to one of the Jungle Book's best-loved characters.

The cub, who took a dip in the river after fishing with his mother and siblings, looked a lot like BalooÂ  the bear as he floated in the water.

The chilled out grizzly was captured on camera by Canadian photographer Patrick Roque, while he was on a trip to British Columbia in Canada.

Mr Roque of Alberta said: 'This particular cub had just finished wrestling with one of his siblings and suddenly decided to sit and rest.

'As the cub was sitting he leaned back a bit too far and rolled onto his back.

'Then, he began playing with its paws, as if he was trying to pretend that it was all part of the plan!'

The 50-year-old managed to get just 150 metres from the family of bears as he sat in a small boat and spent approximately four hours taking pictures of them while they fished for their dinner.

He added: 'I felt amused and entertained while I photographed the cub. But, more importantly, I felt extremely fortunate to be able to witness and document the moment.

The grizzly bear is listed as threatened in the United States and endangered in parts of Canada

'Most of people that view my work are wildlife enthusiasts, and they seem to appreciate the images with the same admiration and respect that I have for these amazing animals.

'Typically, the bears are less concerned about boats than they are with people on land.

'This is likely to be because they know they can easily escape into the forest.

'When you eliminate that escape route, the animal is forced into a defensive mode and typically gets aggressive.

'Unfortunately, due to bear poaching as well as government permitted Trophy Bear hunting in British Columbia, I cannot be more specific regarding the areas in which my photographs are taken.'
