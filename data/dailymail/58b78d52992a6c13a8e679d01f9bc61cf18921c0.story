From his ship, he had witnessed the heroism and the horrors of D-Day at first hand.

So come hell or high water, Bernard Jordan was determined to take part in the 70th anniversary celebrations.

And his escapades ended up making almost as many headlines as the commemorations.

Safely back in Blighty: Staff at Pines Care Home in Hove, East Sussex give Bernard Jordan, 89, a special welcome on his return

Last night the 89-year-old care home resident revealed the thinking behind his mission to Normandy – an adventure dubbed The Great Escape that has enchanted the nation.

Giving his first full interview to a newspaper, he told the Daily Mail: ‘When I set my mind to do something, I do it. This is what Normandy veterans are like.

'Sometimes younger folk underestimate the capabilities and spirit of my generation.’

Mr Jordan had lied about his age to get into the Royal Navy at 17 – a year early. Less than three years later, on June 6 1944, he was an electrical engineer on the Endeavour, supplying tanks to the British troops invading northern France.

‘My job was to make sure the doors of the ship opened properly to let the tanks out. Any electrical job that went wrong, it was my job to put right,’ he said.

‘We released the tanks from the ship, and out of 20, two or three got badly damaged straight away, but the remaining 17 ploughed up the beach.’

He and his comrades worked on, as thousands of servicemen died on the beaches.

‘I was scared – of course I was scared – but you deal with it with pride,’

Mr Jordan said. ‘I used to keep up morale as best I could. I’m no comedian but we tried to keep each other laughing.’

Return: He arrived in Portsmouth to a hero's welcome on Saturday after attending the D-Day commemorations in Normandy on Friday

Grin: He waved to photographers as he was driven away from the ferry port

It was no surprise, then, that he felt he had to be in France for last week’s ceremonies.

‘I’d
 tried to get on an official trip and my care home staff were helping 
me. Everyone had done their best,’ said Mr Jordan, who turns 90 this 
week.

He had resigned 
himself to following the commemorations from home until his bulldog 
spirit got the better of him as he watched the daily TV reports of the 
build-up last week.

‘I 
decided whatever it took I’d get to Normandy. I suppose I was rather 
secretive, but I was anxious nobody would try to deter me,’ he said.

Last Thursday, he dressed and put on his medals, making sure to hide them under his blue mac before he said goodbye to his disabled wife, Irene, 88, who lives with him at the Pines Care Home in Hove, East Sussex.

‘I didn’t want to make a fuss,’ he said. ‘I squeezed her hand and gave her a kiss. I told her, “You’ll miss me for a bit, but I’ll be back shortly.' 

Then I went downstairs and told the care home staff I was going out. I gave them a wave and just walked out.

‘I went down to the bus stop, showed my pensioner’s pass and took the first bus to town.’

Mr
 Jordan, who was mayor of Hove in the 1990s, knew no one would miss him 
for hours. He had planned to attend D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth, 
so took a train along the coast.

‘At this stage I hadn’t planned to go further afield,’ he said.

‘I
 was looking forward to meeting some old pals and talking over our 
memories.’ What happened next, he insisted, was spontaneous. Talking to 
other veterans who were heading for Normandy, he decided to join them.

‘I’d made the journey in far more 
hazardous circumstances during the war. I couldn’t see that any harm 
would come from hopping on to a ferry,’ he said.

He
 bought a £30 Brittany Ferries ticket to Caen, boarded and settled into 
his berth for the night – a welcome change from the conditions he had 
experienced aboard the Endeavour.

‘I was out like a light,’ he said. ‘I used to sleep in a hammock during the war, so this was very comfortable.’

Before
 the boat reached port, retired teacher Christine Orrell saw him sitting
 alone, carrying the two carrier bags of essential rations he’d brought 
for the trip, and invited him to join her party.

Mrs
 Orrell, from Sevenoaks, Kent, was with her family accompanying three 
other veterans to France. They were planning to visit Sword Beach at 
Ouistreham, in memory of her late father.

By now, staff at the Pines were growing increasingly worried about Mr Jordan.

His wife admitted he had told her he was going to Portsmouth and police were alerted. Coincidentally, it had occurred to Mrs Orrell that there may be people back in England anxious about the veteran.

She contacted the Pines to say he was safe – in France.

On Friday, although he had no ticket, Mr Jordan managed to get into the stadium where world leaders including the Queen, David Cameron and President Obama, were gathering.

‘I enjoyed every minute. It was a jolly good day,’ he said, although he admitted he was by now keen to get back home to his wife.

Brittany Ferries agreed to take him on the 11pm crossing and gave him star treatment. By the time Mr Jordan arrived back in Portsmouth on Saturday morning, he was front page news.

‘I was quite surprised. I don’t want people to think I’m trying to play a hero,’ he said.

‘I went across because I felt like it and felt it was the right thing to do. That’s our age group – it’s not a big deal for us, we just get on with things.’

Mr Jordan’s wartime exploits, in which he also served on a ship involved in a successful mission to seize a German Enigma code machine from a U-boat, saw him earn five medals and promotion. By the time he left the Navy in 1948, he was a lieutenant.

‘I’ve always felt this great country’s worth fighting for and I’d fight for it again and again,’ he said. ‘If there was ever another war, God forbid, I hope those who fought in it would do the same as I did to remember it.’

Cunning: Mr Jordan was reported missing from his care home last week. Hours later, staff realised he had crept out to attend the D-Day commemorations
