Six Australian backpackers wanted in connection with the death of a man in Peru have been told they must return to South America where they will appear in court accused of murder. 

The friends, dubbed The Peru Six, checked into the 12th floor holiday apartment in January 2012 after a 21-hour bus journey from Cuzco to Lima in Peru. 

Three hours later, they say they heard a 'thud' before finding the body of apartment porter Lino Rodriguez Vilchez, 45, on the road outside.

Recalled: The six Australian backpackers have been accused of murdering a Peruvian doorman in Lima

After the young Australians were questioned along with everyone else staying in the apartment block, police ruled Mr Rodriguez death as suicide. 

But now the six - Hugh and Tom Hanlon and Jessica Vo, of Melbourne, and Sam Smith, Harrison Geier and Andrew Pilat from Sydney, have been ordered to return to South America where they face murder charges.

They have been accused of throwing Mr Rodriguez off their balcony. 

It has been reported in Peruvian newspapers that Mr Rodriguez had debts and that his family would not receive an insurance payout if his death was a suicide.

A campaign group has now been set up on Facebook protesting the Australians' innocence called 'Completely Wrongly Accused.' 

This morning the group posted: 'We are gutted and completely blown away by the bad news we have received from Peru.

'We have been told by our lawyers that the judge has refused our appeal to provide out statements from Australia.' 

A date will now be set for the group, who are all in their 20s, to appear in court in Lima in August. 

On their Facebook page, which has more than 27,000 likes, it reads: '18 months ago we were just six friends travelling South America but became victims of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.'

The six say Mr Rodriguez never stepped inside their apartment and only helped them carry their luggage to the lift and gave them directions to a grocery shop. 

Police changed their minds regarding the circumstances of the death after Mr Rodriguez's brother Wimber claimed he was pushed off the balcony when he complained to the Australians about noise. 

'It’s a complete lie,' Ms Vo, who decided to go on the South America trip after recovering from ovarian cancer, told Australia’s ABC TV this week.

A campaign has begun in Lima calling for the Australian backpackers to return and face murder charges

'I don’t know how they [the police] could possibly have that type of scenario in their head, because there’s no evidence.' 

It was only after friends noticed their names in Peruvian media that they realised they had been suspected of murder. 

Federal Attorney-General Marl Dreyfus said last month: 'There's been very high level contact between the Australian government and the government of Peru but I can't comment further.'
