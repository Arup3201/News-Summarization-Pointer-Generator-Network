A bizarre crime wave has swept a neighbourhood in rural Australia - where dozens of homeowners have had their doormats swiped from their porches.

More than 40 baffled residents of Ararat, Victoria, awoke to find their mats missing last week.

But it seems whoever is behind the thefts has no use for the multitude of mats, as a huge pile was left at the local police station.
