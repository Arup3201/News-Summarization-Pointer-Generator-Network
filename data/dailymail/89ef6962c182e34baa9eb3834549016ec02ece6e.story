A Colorado woman whose two-year-old daughter died from an overdose of Oxycodone before police found drugs mixed with candy in her home has pleaded guilty to charges of child abuse.

In a courtroom outside Boulder on Thursday Erin Maison-Everhart, 32, wiped away tears while entering her plea to a reduced charge of negligent child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury.

The Broomfield mother previously faced negligent child abuse resulting in death.

Guilty: Erin Maison-Everhart, 32, pleaded guilty to a charge of negligent child abuse that lead to the fatal drug overdose of her two-year-old daughter

In February her daughter Annalise McKenna Maison-Chavez was found in her home not breathing or showing any other signs of life.

An autopsy later found toxic levels of the painkiller Oxycodone in her body.

Her mother had been taking multiple medications for chronic illnesses but told police she used her medication responsibly.

In an initial search of her home police reported finding the medication stored in secure locations.

Killed: Annalise McKenna Maison Chavez, 2, was found with toxic levels of prescription drug Oxycodon in February with one bag of pills found mixed with candy on the floor of the child's home

But in a second search they found a Ziploc bag on the floor of a bedroom's closet containing multiple types of pills including Imodium, an anti-diarrhea medication, and aspirin.

It also contained two candy canes.

A second larger bag was also found on the floor holding several sealed bottles of various other medications.

Maison-Everhart is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 11.

Addressing her sentencing on Thursday a judge told her he would ask for a pre-sentence investigation report to administer a fair sentence.

'I must give this a lot of thought,' Judge Patrick Murphy told her according to theÂ Denver Post. 'I am very sorry for your loss.'
