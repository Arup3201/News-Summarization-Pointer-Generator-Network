Controversial Senator Jacqui Lambie has quit the Palmer United Party, announcing that Tasmanians, not Clive Palmer, 'are my boss'.

She formally resigned from his party this morning and declared that she will not form nor join another party, claiming it was a case of 'once bitten, twice shy'.

The Tasmanian Senator, 43, won a place in parliament at the 2013 federal election (September 7) and the 'deal-breaker' for her decision to go it alone was the overwhelming support from her home state and not her disintegrating relationship with Mr Palmer.

Controversial Senator Jacqui Lambie has quit the Palmer United Party, announcing that Tasmanians, not Clive Palmer, 'are my boss'

Senator Jacqui Lambie speaks in the Senate chamber in Parliament House in Canberra. Ms Lambie announced she would resign from the Palmer United Party and continue to serve as an Independent Senator

'I started thinking about where we were going about a month or 6 weeks ago, it’s all come to a head, I didn’t believe it was in the best interests of Tasmania and was better on my own two feet,' Ms Lambie said.

The pair has not spoken since Remembrance Day.

Her former party leader launched a broadside in an interview with Fairfax Media, telling them she pre-empted an imminent move by the party against her, by leaving. 

'I think you can understand that it's a good outcome for the party because her views are in conflict with what the people who elected her care about,' he said.

'I don't think she'll achieve very much as a senator generally.'

Jacqui Lambie took her place as deputy leader of the Senate for the Palmer United Party on July 1 this year but she was stripped of that deputy role in the Senate for PUP last week, following heated words with Mr Palmer.

If she runs into her former boss in parliament she said 'I’ll just smile at him and say hello because that is the polite thing to do'.

Senator Lambie has called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to admit he was wrong on ADF member payments and Australians 'will forgive him'

Senator Jacqui Lambie has quit the Palmer United Party, effective immediately. She will stand as an Independent and has said military pay, Medicare co-payments and tertiary overhaul issues are 'non-negotiable'

Jacqui Lambie has left the door open to negotiate on issues with Clive Palmer and if she sees him will ‘just smile at him and say hello because that is the polite thing to do’

'My resignation today will end that damaging speculation and uncertainty,' she told parliament.

'I must be free to vote in the Senate in the best interest of Tasmanians.'

Senator Lambie said she had been thinking over her party membership while she got legal advice on leaving PUP.

At a media conference she reinforced a determination to negotiate a better pay deal for Australian Defence Force members.

'The Prime Minister has done the wrong thing in this area, it takes a big man to admit he’s wrong,' she said.

'If Mr Abbott rethinks the pay offer for ADF members then I’m sure Australians will forgive him. It’s about our national security, about the morale of people who are putting their lives on the line.' 

Clive Palmer and Jacqui Lambie have not spoken since a row about Remembrance Day. He's told Fairfax Media that her departure pre-empted a party move against her and insists she will not achieve very much as senator

Once were colleagues. Jacqui Lambie has cut her ties with the Palmer United Party led by mining billionaire Clive Palmer

Jacqui Lambie served in the Australian army for more than 10 years but her first foray into politics came via volunteer work for an Australian Labor Party (ALP) candidate in Tasmania.

She actually joined the Liberal Party three years ago but then moved into a role with Clive Palmer's team ahead of the 2013 election.

Senator Lambie also guaranteed that she would not vote for proposed fee changes to tertiary education and the government's Medicare $7 co-payment plan, insisting they were non-negotiable issues because 'that’s what I promised Australians and my Tasmanians'.

She apologised for the ongoing uncertainty over her membership with PUP and that took the decision to resign because she had been prevented from voting in a way which was 'best for Tasmania'

As for the war of words between her and party leader Clive Palmer, Senator Lambie added that 'I don't have the time or energy to be drawn into a political conflict'.

The PUP leader issued a statement accusing Senator Lambie of establishing the Australian Defence Veterans Party between winning the election and taking up her seat in the Senate for PUP. 

That party's website says its inaugural meeting was held on January 26, 2014. On Monday it had made no mention of Senator Lambie.

Mr Palmer also said the senator had to answer questions about when she was receiving a disability pension.

'That is still in legal dispute, I was not receiving any payments or military compensation payments,' said Senator Lambie, going on to add that she was living off her own finances for several months.

The Palmer United Party has effectively held the balance of power in the Senate since July but her resignation leaves the party with two senators in the upper house.
