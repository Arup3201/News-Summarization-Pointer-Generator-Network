The mother of a woman murdered by her cheating husband asked  yesterday: ‘How do we tell three  little girls that their daddy  murdered their mummy?’

Louise Evans, 32, was pushed down the stairs by her husband Alan after she discovered he was having an affair. He then smothered her to death.

Evans, 35, tried to disguise his crime by making it look as if she had tripped over a skipping rope and vacuum cleaner.

Alan Evans (pictured with his wife on their wedding day), 35, broke down in the dock and held his head in his hands at Worcester Crown Court after being unanimously convicted of killing his wife Louise

Three months later, he continued his affair with 30-year-old married teaching assistant Amanda Chadwick.

After he was found guilty yesterday, his mother-in-law Judith Bollen said her ‘happy world’ had been shattered.

She said: ‘How do we tell three little girls that their daddy murdered their mummy?

‘For
us, our lives have been changed forever. It is near impossible to 
describe the grief, distress and upheaval that Louise’s untimely death 
has brought to our lives.

‘Alan’s
attitude and reaction to Louise’s death has been so distressing for us.
Since her death, Alan has shown no signs of remorse or regret.’

Mrs Bollen, who prepared her statement in October last year, said her 'happy world' had been shattered by the killing, which she and her husband initially thought was a tragic accident

In her statement, Mrs Bollen accused her daughter's husband of carrying on with his life as if his wife's death meant nothing to him

Judie Bollen, mother of Louise Evans is consoled as she leaves Worcester Crown after Alan Evans is jailed for her daughter's murder.

Evans
had a four-month affair with Miss Chadwick, who taught at his 
daughters’ school in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, between March and 
July last year.

They 
exchanged more than 2,000 text messages – including dozens of a sexual 
nature – and would secretly meet in motels on lunch-breaks and have sex 
in their marital beds.

To 
disguise the affair, Evans tried to encourage his wife to make friends 
with Miss Chadwick and her then husband and the couples would go for 
walks together.

However Mrs Evans, a care worker, found out about the affair several months before her death.

Prosecuting
at Worcester Crown Court, Jonas Hankin QC said: ‘Rather than end the 
affair, Evans and Amanda Chadwick actually continued to plan for a life 
together, even talking about having children.’

Mobile phone records established Evans conducted a four-month affair with family friend Amanda Chadwick (pictured), sending her around 6,700 text messages between dates in March and July last year

Evans, who worked as a welder, claimed during the trial his 32-year-old wife (pictured) had tripped and fallen as he slept in the lounge on the night of July 9 last year

The
court heard that Mrs Evans confronted her husband, a former welder, 
about his affair for a second time moments before he attacked her on 
July 9 last year.

Evans then
‘pushed’ or ‘threw’ her down the stairs after punching her four times, 
then smothered her as she lay unconscious at the bottom, the court 
heard.

Neighbours reported 
hearing Mrs Evans screaming. Once she was dead, Evans placed a hoover 
and skipping rope in his wife’s path to make it look like she had 
tripped.

The court was told she had died at around 11.30pm but an 
ambulance was not called for over an hour.

Judge
Justice Hickinbottom said: ‘You did not go to her aid, you did not 
summon help. You spent part of that hour moving things in your house to 
make it appear as though your wife’s death was an accident.

The court heard Evans colluded with his mistress (pictured leaving 
court) to deceive his wife by sending manufactured text messages to each
other days before her death

‘You
grotesquely put a skipping rope under your dead wife’s arm and placed a
vacuum cleaner at the top of the stairs, saying to the police and this 
court that you found the hose of that device two or three steps down.

‘You maintained this charade that you knew nothing of her death and had slept through a terrible accident.’

Three
months after the murder, Evans and Miss Chadwick went on holiday to 
Wales, as a couple, for her mother’s birthday, where she introduced him 
to all of her family.

The jury was shown photographs of the pair cuddling up together, smiling, on a windy beach.

Judge Hickinbottom added: ‘We shall never know precisely what happened at your home that night – only you will ever know that.

‘However,
we do know that every life is precious, that by the account of every 
witness Louise was a lovely and loved daughter, family member and 
friend. Her death has shattered a happy family and robbed three children
of their devoted mother.’
