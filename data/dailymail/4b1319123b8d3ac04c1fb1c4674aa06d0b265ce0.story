American authorities are increasing the number of licenses for surveillance drones despite concerns over personal privacy.

The Federal Aviation Administration announced on Friday that it had issued 1,428 permits to domestic drone operators since 2007, far more than were previously known.

Of these permits, 327 are still listed as active.

The permits have been issued to police, universities, transport departments and at least seven federal agencies for devices from unarmed Predators drones to model airplanes.

This week the FAA took the step of soliciting proposals to create six testing sites for drones ahead of the September 2015 deadline set by Congress to open airspace to drones.

It estimates that as many as 10,000 drones could take to the skies by 2020.

Police departments are said to be waiting for the FAA to issue guidelines on drone use in congested area, among other issues, according to the LA Times.

Lawmakers in 15 states are looking at plans to restrict drone use in their airspace amid concerns over spying.

Earlier this month the mayor of Seattle ordered the city's police to abandon its plan to use drones after protests from residents and privacy campaigners, despite FAA approval.

Mayor Mike McGinn said the police department would return the unmanned aerial vehicles to the vender after being bought with a federal grant.

The drones would have been unarmed but allowed the police to use face-recognition software.

Opposition
to the use of drones in the United States has come from across the political spectrum, including civil liberties advocates and those
worried over government intrusion.

Earlier this month the Charlottesville City Council in Virginia passed a resolution imposing a two-year moratorium on the use of drones within city limits.

The Rutherford Institute, a civil liberties group behind the city's effort, said Charlottesville is the first city in the country to limit the use of drones by police to collect evidence related to criminal activity.

US Department of Homeland Security drones enter Washington airspace occasionally, patrolling the Canadian border east of the Cascade mountains.

The two 10,000-pound Predator-B unmanned aircraft are based in North Dakota.
