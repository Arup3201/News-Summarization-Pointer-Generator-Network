A young designer has made a bold pitch to sell her lingerie to David and Samantha Cameron.

Betty Hobcraft’s racy range is being showcased at the Tory party conference after being shortlisted in a contest backed by the Prime Minister.

The 24-year-old has cheekily suggested Mrs Cameron should buy the Black Nell Robe, costing £95 and boasting a ‘beautiful lace midriff section’.

Designer Betty Hobcraft said lingerie 'still shocks people' but hopes Samantha Cameron might buy one of her Black Nell Robes

Miss Hobcraft’s company, Betty Blue’s Loungerie, is one of 12 finalists in the Start Up Hub competition.

She said: ‘I heard about the competition through Facebook and I thought it could be good for my business.

‘When
I entered I didn't really think I would get in to the final - lingerie 
still shocks people and I thought politicians usually try and stay away 
from controversial things like this.

‘I'm not sure how David Cameron would react but I think Samantha Cameron would look wonderful in one of the black robes.’

The Black Nell Robe is even available ‘covered in hundreds and hundreds of tiny sparkly jet black crystals’.

Mrs
Cameron arrived at the Tory party conference today in more casual 
attire, teaming jeans and a green pullover and bright red heels.

The lingerie range is likely to raise a few eyebrows among delegates more used to trade stands selling socks and sandwiches.

The Start Up Hub exhibition runs until October 10, when an overall winner will be chosen.

Miss Hobcraft set up her company after leaving De Montfort University with a degree in contour fashion.

‘The idea of the competition is to try and persuade people to vote for the business at the conference,’ she added.

‘I might try and encourage some of the women to try the items on but I don't know whether they'll be brave enough.

"I'm sure it will turn a few heads at the conference but hopefully those who are attending will see it as a bit of fun and it'll bring a smile to their faces.

‘Why do woman take pride in her appearance when going out, but not when they are at home?

‘I am firmly of the belief that we should bring a little bit of Hollywood glamour into loungewear, without compromising on comfort..

Launching the Start Up Hub competition, Mr Cameron said: ‘I want to encourage businesses to create and innovate; to invest and grow; to develop and break boundaries.

‘That is why I'm proud that the Conservative Party is once again showcasing the best of British business and innovation at our Conference through the Start Up Hub, and I encourage start ups and entrepreneurs across the UK to get involved.’
