From screaming babies to fearful flyers, you could be sat next to anybody on a plane.

But few airline passengers can claim to have been placed within inches of a falcon.

With its eyes covered by a mask, the bird of prey was captured resting on its  owner's knee by a fellow American passenger during a flight last night.

Unusual passenger: With its eyes covered by a mask, this falcon was spotted travelling on a plane last night

Although it initially seemed content, it was seen starting to move restlessly as the plane headed down the runway.

Footage, taken by the male passenger, shows the falcon's owner warning that as the airliner takes off, the bird will also prepare to fly.

Seconds later, the falcon was seen bending its head toward its owner's body with its long, pointed wings sticking out behind it.

However, its safety restraints meant it could do nothing more than stick its head into its owner's chest.

Although both the passenger and another man seemed to take to the unusual flyer, a female passenger appeared to be frightened by it.

The bird's owner could be heard saying: 'Causing a scene, causing a scene,' while the cameraman remarked: 'I think she said she was scared of birds.'

The remarkable footage was later uploaded to Liveleak by the passenger. The airline or flight on which it was taken remains unknown.

The video was accompanied by the words: 'Had an interesting seat mate on my last flight.

'The guy told me when the flight takes off that the bird can tell it's changing altitude and so prepared to take off himself. You can see him crouching getting ready to take off.

'Not super dramatic, but definitely interesting.'
