Drowned: Ben Morgan, 26, died while swimming after suffering cramp just six inches out of his depth, an inquest heard

A swimmer drowned in a lake after suffering cramp while just six inches out of his depth, an inquest heard.

Ben Morgan, 26, who was on a Bank Holiday family day out, suddenly disappeared from view as his mother watched him in the water.

Although the emergency services were called, he could not be found in the water at Llyn Syfydrin, near Aberystwyth, Wales.

Police divers were called in and his body was recovered the following day, the inquest heard.

Peter Brunton, the
coroner for Ceredigion, said on the balance of probabilities Ben 
had died after suffering an attack of the cramp while in the water on 
August 26.

'That is the only reasonable explanation. The onset would be very sudden, and incapacitating,' he said.

'He was six to eight inches out of his depth, that is all, but sufficient if unable to continue swimming.'

Sergeant Sian Davies said the weather was clear and sunny on the August Bank Holiday Monday. She added that although the water was not rough, there was a strong current.

Ben's mother Sarah Jane had watched her son swimming towards a grassy island and he was about 20 metres away from it when he disappeared.

Hunt: Police searched the area on Bank Holiday weekend but could not find missing Ben. His body was discovered face down in the water the following day

She looked away, and when she turned back he was gone.

The next day underwater search team diver PC Hefin Morgan found Ben's body face down at the bottom of the lake.

Ben was 5ft 10inches tall and the water was around 6ft 2in deep in the area the body was found.

In statements, Mrs Morgan, and Benâ€™s twin brother Daniel, said he was 'a good swimmer'.

Daniel had been swimming earlier but had stopped for fear of getting cramp in his legs.

A post-mortem, by Dr Huyam Abdelsalam, revealed the cause of death was drowning.

The coroner ruled that the death of Ben, from Penbontrhydybeddau, near Penrhyncoch, was an accident.

Andy Bakewell, manager of WiseWoods Wales sawmills where Ben was learning woodland skills, said: 'Ben joined us in September 2012. He loved the woods, and we really appreciated him.

'His passing has left a huge hole. We see things that remind us of him everywhere. We miss him, and will always remember him.'
