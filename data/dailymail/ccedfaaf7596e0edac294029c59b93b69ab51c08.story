Love-struck: Elizabeth Robinson was allowed to meet with the object of her affection, 12-year-old Dylan, after reuniting with her parents

A lovesick 13-year-old Texas girl was found safe and sound after traveling hundreds of miles to visit a boy she has been talking with over an Internet game, and on Friday the two were allowed to finally meet face to face.

Elizabeth Annette Robinson, of Cypress, Texas, was tracked to Nashville, Tennessee, where a trooper stopped the teen Thursday after he noticed that the car she was driving matched the description included in an Amber Alert which had been issued for her.

Harris County Sheriff’s deputies said Robinson was released to her parents Friday morning in Nashville, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The 13-year-old was reported missing Thursday after her mother said she had sneaked out of her bedroom the night before.

Robinson
decided to run away after getting into an argument with her parents 
over a 12-year-old boy from Kentucky she had met on the Internet through
the Xbox video game Call of Duty.

‘She
started staying in her bedroom more, isolating herself where she was 
always with the headset, always talking. That’s how they communicated 
through the Xbox,’ Tressa Robinson told KHOU.

Elizabeth’s father took away the Xbox console earlier this week, and that is when the girl apparently hatched a plan to take off on her quest.

Robinson’s mother said she had been asking questions about the brother’s car and what kind of gas mileage it gets.

The girl, whom her mother, Tressa Robinson, described as naive and sheltered, fled in her brother's 2011 brown Nissan Versa and with her mother’s debit card, and was believed to be headed to Hodgenville, Kentucky, to meet up with her young friend, Dylan.

While years away from being able to 
obtain a learner's permit to operate a vehicle, Robinson managed to 
drive more than 790 miles before she was stopped outside of Nashville, 
Deputy Thomas Gilliland, spokesman for the Harris County Sheriff's 
Office, said.

'It's amazing she was able to manipulate the roadways,' Gilliland said.

Worried: Although her mother, Tressa, described Elizabeth as naive, the girl managed to operate a vehicle, navigate highways and use her debit card before she was stopped in Tennessee

The 13-year-old fled her home at around 9:30pm Wednesday night. The following morning, her parents discovered that she had escaped, leaving a note behind saying that she was running away to a girlfriend’s house because of bullies at school, and threatening to kill herself.

But after going through her email messages, Elizabeth’s parents figured out that their daughter was actually heading to Kentucky to meet with her Xbox boyfriend.

Dylan stayed at home in Kentucky. He apparently said over the phone that he tried to dissuade the 13-year-old from running away.

Authorities began tracking Elizabeth’s travels through her mother’s debit card. She used it on Thursday in Henderson, Texas.

According to WSMV, Trooper Dwayne Stanford received an alert that the runaway teen had been seen in Hope, Arkansas, at around 2pm Thursday. He calculated that she would be headed his way about 10pm or 11 pm.

Around her expected arrival time, the officer pulled into a median and decided to wait.As Stanford predicted, Elizabeth drove by him on Interstate 40 outside of Nashville around 10.24pm. He immediately activated his emergency lights to pull her over.

After crashing into a guard rail, the teen was taken into custody and her parents were notified to pick her up.

Once
her father arrived, however, the family decided it would be best to let
her complete her journey and finally meet Dylan. He drove her the rest 
of the way to Kentucky visit the boy.
