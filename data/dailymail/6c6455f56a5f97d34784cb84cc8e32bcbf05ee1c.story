One entrepreneurial little girl has turned the theft of her iPod into a impressive business opportunity. 

Isabel Haig has replaced her stolen iPod - by setting up her own business selling hundreds of loom bands to other youngsters.

The ten year old had been left heartbroken when her £300 music player containing her favourite One Direction songs was grabbed by a sneak thief whilst she was at a service station with her father.

But instead of begging her family to by her a new one she got in a bulk load of the brightly coloured loom bands to make a pile of bracelets.

Isabel has created her own loom band business to raise money to help her replace her iPod touch

Showing great entrepreneurial spirit, little Isabel turned her loss into an business opportunity 

She then began selling them for £1 to £1.50 a time during fayres at her primary school and got herself her own stall under the brand name: 'Loomed by Izzy.'

After her stock was snapped up, the youngster began to branch out - making loom band snakes and figurines and appointing eight year old sister Grace and brother Aiden, aged seven as her 'apprentices.' She is now inviting customers to place orders on Facebook.

Within only a month Isabel, from Astley Bridge, near Bolton, Greater Manchester had raised enough to buy herself a new iPod touch - but the youngster is refusing to halt her lucrative business.

Her father Andrew Haig, 48, a jewellery agent said: 'Isabel is definitely the arty one of the family, she is really bright and intelligent and has a real eye for fashion, art is her favourite subject and she really excels at it.

'She does every single loom band herself, all we do is transport her to craft shows around once a fortnight and we bought her the starter pack and that is it - she is incredible at the designs and people can't believe a ten-year-old girl made them. 

The ten-year-old was already into the loom band craze before she started her business 

'She is brilliantly talented, her mother and I are so proud of her, she has really made a name for herself at the craft fairs and she is so generous - she has even given her brother and sister a 'job'.'

He added: 'It started when I decided to take Isabel out for the day in March for her to see what I do - it was sort of a 'let's go to work with daddy day' and she was really excited.

'She took her IPod with her which had lots of pictures on and music by her favourite band One Direction. I stopped off at a service station and she put it down on the counter for a second and when she looked again it had been swiped.

During school holidays, the ten-year-old spends up to three hours a day making her pieces 

'She was heartbroken, I told her it was fine and I would buy her a new one, I hated seeing her so upset about it. We were planning to buy her a new one when her mum and I had an idea.

'She had taken up doing loom bands, everyone at school was doing it and we found she was actually really good at it. She would beg us every other week for a few pounds to buy new loom bands and we were happy that she had found something to do, it was a nice little hobby.

'She was already making them for free for all of her friends but her mum thought she could sell them for £1.50. Isabel loved the idea, we told her that we would buy her a starter kit which had plenty of bands in and if she raised half of the money for the IPod, we would pay the rest.

Despite having raised enough for two new iPods, industrious Isabel is refusing to halt her lucrative business

'Over the Easter break in March she and Grace wre spending around two to three hours each day making loom bands and when she went back to school she had made £100 after two months. She then started at craft fairs and would make £100 each month, so far she has made around £600 and bought herself the IPod and a Furby plus treated her brother and sister.  

'It is a really good thing to teach children that you have to work for nice things, it keeps them grounded and down to earth. Isabel will do this for a long time, she loves it and she is really happy making them and she has become much more independent.'

Mother Lisa Haig, 38, a housewife said: 'I'm really proud of Izzy. She's worked really hard over the summer and it has paid off. She had originally been making loom bands for free for friends at school and I suggested that she sell them instead. She makes all sorts of styles.'

Isabel said: 'I was really upset when my iPod got stolen and this was the best way to raise money to buy another one. 'I love making the snakes and pencil toppers most, and want to carry on selling them.'
