Michael Clarke has written an emotional tribute to Phillip Hughes, saying he was ‘a better man for having known him’ and promising 'I will miss you forever, but I will not forget'.

Hughes, who died on Thursday after being hit by a bouncer in a domestic match in Sydney two days earlier, would have been 26 on Sunday.

Clarke used the occasion to remember his former team-mate and one of his closest friends. ‘His cricketing achievements — of which there were many — really play second fiddle to the human qualities that he exhibited,’ wrote the Australian captain. 

Michael Clarke was brought to tears during a press conference on Saturday morning 

Australia's cricket captain sent a message to the family of the late Phillip Hughes

Clarke and Hughes share a joke as they bat for Australia 

‘Loyal to a fault, eternally optimistic, kind hearted, wicked sense of humour, a childlike verve for life … I really could go on and on.

‘I don’t think in 12 years of playing cricket at the top level I have ever come across a more loyal or generous-hearted team-mate.

‘I don’t have a blood brother, but I am very proud to have called Phillip my brother. I am a better man for having known him.

‘Vale Hugh Dog. I will miss you forever, but I will not forget. Happy birthday bro.’ 

Clarke said he does not have a blood brother by treated Hughes like a sibling

Clarke also used his newspaper column to offer words of consolation to Sean Abbott, the 22-year-old New South Wales seamer who was bowling when Hughes was hit, saying he was not to blame in anyway and ‘deserves our full support’.

Hughes’ funeral will take place in his home town of Macksville on Wednesday, while the first Test between Australia and India at Brisbane, which was due to begin the following day and was expected to feature Hughes’ return to Test cricket, has been postponed.

Clarke said: 'The world lost one of its great blokes this week and we are all poorer for it'

The Brisbane game has yet to be rescheduled, though one possibility is to bring the second Test — due to start in Adelaide on December 12 — forward by a few days. The Test at Brisbane’s Gabba could then be staged at a later date.

It is unlikely any members of England’s tour party in Sri Lanka will be able to attend the funeral, which takes place on the same day as their third one-day international in Hambantota.
