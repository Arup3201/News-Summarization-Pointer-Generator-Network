Teen sports star Laura Robson ditched her 
tennis whites and showed off her more glamorous side for a night on the town at prestigious haunt Mahiki last night.

She may only be nineteen but she now one of the 
most marketable tennis stars after reaching the fourth round at 
Wimbledon earlier this month.

It isn't just her ball skills that get her noticed; her personality and looks are also key to 
her appeal.

Letting her hair down: Tennis ace Laura Robson was seen leaving Mahiki at 3am

Leaving her 
sporty gear at home for the evening, the athlete cut 
an effortlessly chic figure as she showed off her style credentials in 
a pair of black shorts, a blue and purple top and smart black blazer.

The Sydney-born sportswoman completed 
her look with a vibrant blue clutch bag, gold jewellery and a killer 
tan - no doubt acquired during her time on the court at SW19.

Laura certainly looked like she was making the most of her time away from competition as she looked partied out as she left the famed nightclub at 3am.

Laura's Wimbledon dream came to an 
end last fortnight when she left Court No 1 fighting back tears after 
suffering a defeat at the hands of Estonian Kaia Kanepi.

Visibly devastated, she said of her 
loss: 'It is more disappointing because I put so much pressure on 
myself. I had my chances and I just didn’t take them.

'I have so much to work on before I 
can even think of getting to Slam finals. But, cliched as it sounds, 
it’s all part of the learning experience and the more I get myself in 
these situations the more I’m going to benefit.'

Laura later added on her Twitter page: 'Gutted about today but thank you all so much for the support. Really has been amazing!'

Despite
her loss, insiders are predicting her off-court earnings will hit £1million because of her nationwide popularity. She has already signed up 
to become the face of Virgin Active alongside Richard Branson.

The fact 
that she is a British player who might one day win Wimbledon gives her 
an appeal way beyond these shores.

Fun times: Laura looked like she had enjoyed her night on the town as she left at 3am

Time for bed: Laura hopped into a taxi at 3am to make her way home after enjoying a night out with friends following her hard work on the tennis court last fortnight

It is easily forgotten, after the 
triumph of Andy Murray, that while she was in the tournament she 
garnered as much attention as him.

She has been working with coach Miles 
Maclagan this summer and after a post-Wimbledon break is preparing for 
the swing of tournaments in America, leading into the U.S. Open.

Now that 
she is ranked 31 in the world, it is likely that she will be seeded at 
Flushing Meadows at the end of next month, the first time she has been a
seed in a Grand Slam.

Talented: Laura's Wimbledon dream came to an when she lost to Estonian Kaia Kanepi last fortnight at Wimbledon

Golden girl: Laura, who hails from Australia, is the current no. 1 ranked female player in the United Kingdom

Double act: Laura won a silver medal playing with Andy Murray in the mixed doubles at the 2012 London Olympics
