British travellers are getting better hotel deals abroad than at home, with London the 23rd most expensive destination globally.

But prices aren't necessarily rising everywhere, the new survey shows.

Out of 115 world cities, as many as 63 offered UK tourists lower rates in the first half of this year compared with the same period in 2013.

Monte Carlo has the most expensive hotel prices in the world, says the survey

Number 23: Hotel prices in London rose by 9 per cent to £127 over the last year

1. Monte Carlo                                £223 2. Muscat

Cannes                                       £168 7. Rio de Janeiro                            £166 8. San Francisco                            £153 9. Geneva                                      £153 10. Boston                                      £152

 Poland                              £6210. Krabi, Thailand                             £63

A poll from Hotels.com showed that while average hotel room prices rose globally by 4 per cent in the first six months of 2014, London prices exceeded that with a rise of 9 per cent to £127.

Elsewhere in the UK, Edinburgh prices rose 7 per cent to £102 and in Ireland, Dublin room rates increased by 10 per cent to £87.

The city table of hotel prices was headed up by Monte Carlo, where hotel rates leapt by 21 per cent to an average of £223 in the first half of this year.

The next-most expensive place for hotels was the Middle East destination of Muscat (up 5 per cent to £197), followed by Key West in Florida (£192), New York (£171) and Cancun in Mexico (£170).

Big Apple: New York was found to have the fourth most pricey hotels in the world

Cheapest place for a bed: In Phnom Penh, Cambodia you could find a hotel for £34

At the other end of the table, the 
cheapest hotel rooms in the first half of this year were to be found in 
Phnom Penh in Cambodia.

Here, Britons would have only had to fork out 
£34 for a night's stay.

The next most-affordable destination was Hanoi in Vietnam (£37) followed by the Thailand resorts of Pattaya (£39) and Chiang Mai (£40).

Overall, prices stayed the same in nine of the surveyed destinations, while they rose in 43 places.

Hotels in countries that suffered worst from the global recession were particularly noticeable for the hike in prices, said Hotels.com brand vice president Matt Walls.

Capital city: London hotel room prices have increased 9 per cent in the past year to £127

'Average prices paid in Greece, Iceland and Ireland have all risen considerably for most travellers in the first six months of the year,' he says.

'However, there is no doubt that UK travellers will be getting greater value for their money in most destinations this year.

'The strength of the pound means that UK travellers can really stretch their budgets that much further.'
