Chelsea new boy Loic Remy trained at the club's Cobham training ground on Tuesday morning as the striker recovered from his international exploits with France.

The former Queens Park Rangers forward will be hoping to be in contention for a place in Jose Mourinho's sqaud on Saturday as the Blues take on Swansea at Stamford Bridge.

Remy could even be in line for a start on what will be his home debut as Mourinho's sweats on the fitness of star striker Diego Costa.

The Spaniard, who has already scored four goal for Chelsea this season, left international duty with Spain kast week amid fears he had injured his hamstring.

The same injury had threatened to keep Costa out of Chelsea's match against Everton last weekend, but the 25-year-old proved his fitness and then some by scoring twice in a brilliant 6-3 win for the Blues.

Speaking on his competition, Remy told Chelsea's official website: 'We have two great strikers here already and I don't have a choice if I want to be in the team - I have to play at a very high level.'
