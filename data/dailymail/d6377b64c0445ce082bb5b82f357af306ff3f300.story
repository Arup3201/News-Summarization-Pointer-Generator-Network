This week's Eastleigh by-election was triggered by the resignation as MP of Chris Huhne who pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice

Nick Clegg today pleaded with voters to not punish the Liberal Democrats for Chris Huhne's lies, ahead of the crucial Eastleigh by-election.

With polls showing the contest is on course for a photo finish, Mr Clegg made a whistlestop visit to the constituency of his former Cabinet colleague who quit as an MP after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice.

The Lib Dem leader tried to argue Mr Huhne's private life should not overshadow his achievements as a local MP.

'It’s really important to say this, by the way, everyone wants to give Chris Huhne a kicking,' he told BBC Radio Solent.

'But actually people are telling me locally, whatever he might have done in court, whatever might have happened with his marriage, he was a really excellent local MP who worked with an excellent Liberal Democrat team.'

Mr Clegg's attempts to use interviews with local media in Hampshire to drum up support ahead of Thursday's vote were overshadowed by the growing scandal of his handling of allegations of inappropriate behaviour by former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard. Mr Clegg insisted today he had 'nothing to hide' after admitting he knew of non-specific allegations made by women five years ago.

The Lib Dems had been on course to win the Eastleigh seat, but as the Rennard scandal exploded the polls have narrowed with the Tories now ahead.

Support for the UK Independence Party is also growing, suggesting the crunch vote on Thursday could turn into a three-cornered fight.                                      

According to a Survation poll published yesterday the Conservatives have a narrow lead of four percentage points over the Lib Dems, reversing recent findings that gave Nick Clegg’s party a similar advantage.

Support for the Tories is now 33 per cent with the Lib Dems on 29. A previous survey by Populus, published on Saturday, put the Lib Dems five points ahead.

According to the Survation poll, a surge in Ukip support has seen them rise to 21 per cent, eight points clear of Labour, who seem destined for a humiliating fourth place.

The by-election has been billed as a ‘must-win’ for both Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg.

Tory activists have privately expressed pessimism about the prospects of their candidate Maria Hutchings after receiving a hostile reception on doorsteps.

Ukip’s performance is bad news for David Cameron since it suggests the Tories risk losing seats across Britain where the Eurosceptic party is leeching votes away from the Conservatives.

Ukip may even be within striking 
distance of their first by-election win. The Populus poll put the Lib 
Dem candidate, Mike Thornton, on 33 per cent, with the Tories on 28 per 
cent and Ukip on 21 per cent.

But analysis by UK Polling Report’s 
Anthony Wells revealed that those numbers included allocating ‘don’t 
know’ responses based on how participants voted in 2010 - votes that may
not be repeated in the by-election.

Mr Wells said if those ‘don’t knows’ 
are discounted, the Lib Dems are only on 31 per cent, the Tories on 26 
per cent and Ukip close behind on 25 per cent.

Ken Clarke, now minister without 
portfolio, said it would not be a surprise if the Tories lost. ‘I always
prefer to win by-elections but governments don’t usually win 
by-elections,’ he said.

‘If we do lose it, it can hardly be 
said that it’s too surprising given we are mid-term, facing difficult 
problems and obviously this is regarded as essentially a Conservative 
government.’

Tory sources say Marta Andreasen, the 
former Ukip MEP who defected to the Conservatives, will be wheeled out 
tomorrow in a bid to win back votes. Grant Shapps and Michael Gove will 
also travel to Eastleigh this week.

But in a sign that Tories may regard the seat as lost, David Cameron will not be returning.
