Two female members of Russian punk group Pussy Riot have been sent to Siberia's 'worst prison hell', far away from their small children in Moscow.

Maria Alyokhina, 24, and Nadezhda 
Tolokonnikova, 22, were convicted of ‘hooliganism motivated by religious
 hatred’ in August, after they burst into a cathedral to protest against Vladmir Putin.

They were sentenced to two years in jail for the stunt, a punishment that
 many in the West said was too harsh.

The two women lost their appeals on 
October 10 and have now been sent to harsh labour camps hundreds of miles from the capital city.

Tolokonnikova has been sent to swamp-infested Mordovia, 
about 300 miles east of Moscow, which has some of the most notorious jails in Russia.

Alyokhina has gone to Siberia's remote Perm region, near 
the Ural Mountains, about 700 miles east of the capital.

'These are the harshest camps of all the possible choices,' said the band on its Twitter account yesterday.

Supporters on the social networking site called the colonies 'the worst prison hell there is'.

The desperate families of the two women still do not know the exact camps to which the women are being sent.

By
 law, relatives must be informed once a convict arrives at a prison, but
 the trip can take days. There is one women's prison about 60 miles from 
Moscow, but most are much further away.

The two's women's lawyers' cited health and safety concerns over the far-flung penal colonies.

Kremlin critics claim the extreme measures are 
part of a crackdown on dissent orchestrated by the Russian president, who began a 
six-year term in May.

The dominant Russian Orthodox Church and many citizens were infuriated that the women had used the Moscow's main cathedral for their 'punk prayer' and had called on the Virgin Mary to oust Putin.

The church has cast their protest as part of a 
concerted attack against the church and Russian traditions.

It said during their appeal that they should be pardoned on the condition they repented for 'desecrating a holy place'.

Fights
 broke out between Pussy Riot supporters and pro-Church activists as 
huge crowds gathered outside the Moscow courthouse during the appeal hearing.

The duo have been held in a Moscow 
detention centre since their arrests in March.

Western governments and 
musicians like Madonna and Paul McCartney said their sentences were disproportionate, 
but Putin voiced support for the rulings, insisting that the state must 
protect the feelings of the faithful.

A third convicted band member, 
Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released on appeal when a court suspended 
her sentence after her lawyer argued that she had been pulled away from 
the cathedral's altar before the protest song began.

‘They
 have been sent away,’ said one of their lawyers, Mark Feigin, adding that he did not know where the women had gone.
