A holidaymaker was left covered in burns and blisters on his chest after an air stewardess spilled boiling tea on him during a flight.

Father-of-four Khizar Hayat, 40, was travelling on a Qatar Airways flight home to Manchester when another passenger reclined their chair and the hostess who was handing out tea tripped - tipping the boiling hot drink on him. 

The steaming liquid poured down Mr 
Hayat's chest, leaving him with a huge angry red burn and blisters which
 erupted immediately.

Father-of-four Khizar Hayat, 40, was travelling on a Qatar Airways flight when another passenger reclined their chair and the hostess tripped -  tipping the boiling hot drink on him. The steaming liquid poured down Mr Hayat's chest, leaving him with a huge angry red burn and blisters which erupted immediately

But he says despite his agony he was 'brushed off' by the airline crew, who merely gave him a damp cloth to dab his injuries with.

And although he made a formal complaint to the airway when he landed at Manchester Airport and two follow up emails, Mr Hayat is yet to receive an apology.

Mr Hayat, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, said the accident happened as the stewardess leaned over him to nearer to his mother in a window seat.

He said: 'I was in absolute agony. The pain was incredible.

'As soon as it happened I pulled my shirt open and could see blisters popping up already.

'The air stewardess was quite dismissive actually, she apologised once but none of them seemed very eager to make up for what had happened.

'And on top of that, they didn't seem to be doing much to ease the pain I was in. They gave me a cloth and some water to dab at the burn, which helped initially but whenever I moved it, the pain started again.

'They gave me some gel to put on the burn but that didn't really help.

'I was pacing the floor of the aeroplane because I just couldn't get any relief from the pain.

'I haven't been able to work since it happened, I'm on painkillers and it's even painful wearing clothes - and I'm still waiting for a formal apology.'

Mr Hayat, married to 34-year-old Farhat Uzma, was travelling home from a trip visiting family in Pakistan with his mother Safia Begum on April 2.

'We'd flown from Islamabad to Doha, and were on a seven-hour flight back from Doha when it happened,' he explained.

'We were about two hours into the seven hour flight home, when the air stewardess was giving my mother a cup of tea.

'The passenger in front of me reclined their chair as she leaned over me to pass the cup to my mother, and knocked her - so she spilt the tea over me.

'I jumped up with the pain, it was absolute agony.

'The stewardess took me to the front area where they prepare the food and gave me a sachet of gel to put on the burn and some paracetamol. But that didn't stop the pain at all so she gave me a cloth and a bottle of mineral water to cool it down. But whenever I removed the cloth the pain started again.

'About half an hour later the pain hadn't stopped so they put out an announcement for any medically-trained people on board.

'Luckily there were two doctors - one was a GP and the other a surgeon. They said the burn looked bad and asked the steward if there was anything else they could give to me.

'I've been unable to work and can't dress properly because of the injures. The doctor told me it will take a while to heal,' said the father-of-four

'At this point, a senior cabin crew member, who hadn't been involved before now, gave me another sachet of cream. I don't know what it was. It didn't really help the pain.

'The captain then put out a call to Manchester Airport to tell them to have paramedics ready, so I had to suffer the rest of the flight in pain.

'When we landed, they got all the passengers off before calling the paramedics on board. They put on some more gel and dressed the wound.

'They asked if I wanted an ambulance to take me to hospital but I said I would go to my local hospital as I wanted to get my mother, who's suffered three or four heart attacks in the last couple of years and was very upset about what had happened, home.

'I went to see my GP who gave me flucloxacillin tablets for the pain and a cream to soothe the burns but I've been unable to work and can't dress properly because of the injures. The doctor told me it will take a while to heal.'

He added: 'While I was at the airport, a Qatar Airways representative took a statement from me and I said I wanted to make a formal complaint.

'I've since followed this up with two emails to the address she gave me, asking for a reply, but I've had nothing.

'I'm so angry that they are trying to ignore what happened. I've contacted my solicitor and they are looking into whether I have a case against the airline.'

Qatar Airways denies Mr Hayat's account of events that it has acted negligently in any respect. Lawyers acting for the airline said it would be inappropriate to comment further as Mr Hayat has instructed his solicitors in the matter.
