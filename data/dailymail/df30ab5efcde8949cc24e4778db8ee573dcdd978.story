In the middle of the southern Andes is the unexpected Magic Mountain: a man-made volcano with a stunning waterfall cascading down its side.

It's also the home to the spectacular Montaña Mágica Lodge, a luxury hotel in the heart of Patagonia's 300,000-acre Huilo Huilo Biological Reserve.

Looking as though it's been plucked straight out of a fairy tale, the hotel is completely made out of wood and stone, and would no doubt be at home as a background set for The Hobbit.

In the middle of the Chilean Patagonian rainforest is the Montaña Mágica Lodge, a luxury hotel built inside of a man-made volcano

Located under the majestic Andes Mountain range, the unique hotel is right in the middle of one of the most valued - and endangered - regions in the world.

Aside from simply relaxing inside the one of a kind hotel, venturing into the rainforest offers guests the opportunity to spot many unique animals, such as the Pudu Deer, which is the world's smallest at just 13 inches tall.

Inside, the five-floor hotel boasts an all-natural decor in its 13 small rooms, as well as several hot tubs carved out of gigantic tree trunks, and an intimate bar and restaurant area.

But to experience the 'erupting' hotel, guests will need to brave a swinging rope bridge to enter, as it is only accessible by foot.

The inside bar and restaurant is just as beautiful as the exterior, with it's all-natural wood and stone decor 

If you're lucky, you may even spot the adorable 13-inch Pudu deer - the world's smallest - which lives on the nature reserve

The luxury hotel is only accessible by foot and all guests must walk across a suspension bridge in order to reach reception

Among the activities on offer are mini golf, where the holes are made out of the natural terrain, horseback riding, rafting, plenty of hiking trails and a chance to try the longest zip wire in South America, which runs through the nature reserve at a height of 1,500 feet.

Montaña Mágica is part of the larger Huilo Huilo complex, with also includes the interconnected Baobab Hotel, which can be reached via a suspension walkway, and several other nearby lodges.

Prices at Montaña Mágica range from £150 to £260 per night, which is a steal considering that some neighbouring hotels can go for as high as £1200 a night.

The lodge is located in the 300-acre region of Huilo Huilo Biological Reserve in Patagonia
