Influential: Professor Stephen Hawking has placed a number of previously unseen personal items on display at the Science Museum in London

A new exhibition celebrating the life and work of renowned physicist Stephen Hawking to mark his 70th birthday was unveiled at the Science Museum today.

The exhibition includes a wide range of objects, papers and photos, primarily sourced from the professor’s own collection which had been previously unavailable to the public.

Among them is the blue suit worn by the professor for a zero-gravity flight in 2007, his original drawing of the Hawking Radiation mechanism and his annotated script for a 1999 guest appearance on the Simpsons.

Professor Hawking has recorded a personal voice-over to be featured in the exhibition, in which he credits the museum for 'introducing young people to the wonder and excitement of scientific discovery'.

Also on show is a series of photographic portraits of Hawking commissioned by the museum in December, along with a birthday gift to the professor - a special invention by its current inventor in residence, Mark Champkins.

Entitled Black Hole Light, the invention is a model of the gravitational pull of a black hole and was due to be presented to Prof Hawking at a reception to launch the new display.

Alison Boyle, curator of astronomy at the Science Museum, said: 'We have been very privileged to explore Prof Hawking’s archives, discovering early drafts of his hugely influential scientific papers alongside a rich array of popular material.

'We hope that the selection we have chosen to display will offer a unique insight into the career of the world’s best-known scientist.'

Born in 1942, Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 21 and given two years to live.

But he defied medical opinion by going on to become one of the most influential scientists of the 20th and 21st centuries.
