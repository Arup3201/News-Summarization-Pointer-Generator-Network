The executive director of Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers is facing a two-week jail sentence after eating a piece of paper with an anonymous tip written on it in court instead of handing it over to the judge.

Richard Masten appeared before judge Victoria Brennan after being ordered to share a tip - but not the source of the tip - in a cocaine possession case.

Instead, he tore the piece of paper on which the tip was written into strips and stuffed them into his mouth.

Protection: Masten said he had to protect the identity of the anonymous tipster

'We promise the people who give us information to solve murders, serious violent crimes in this community, that they can call with an assurance that they will remain anonymous and that nothing about them or their information would ever be compromised,' he told NBC Miami.

'The case today started creeping into that... it's not going to happen on my watch and I understood the consequences.'

Brennan ordered Masten to show her the tip after defense attorney Jean-Michel D'Escoubet asked to see the information it contained.

D'Escoubet had no need to see the identity of the tipster, he said, only the information that was to be used against his client.

Some believe Masten's attention-seeking stunt was an unnecessary step.

'In this case, there’s absolutely no information that I am looking for that has to do with the name or the identity of a tipster,' Jean-Michel D’Escoubet said.

'It's only the evidence that would be used in trial against her that the tip provided.'

Brennan was going to make the decision as the whether or not the tip would compromise the identity of the tipster.

However, Masten did not have faith in that process protecting the tipster.

'If you do it in this case, the question comes down the road, well you did it in that case why not this case,' he said.

'Well, I’m not going to do it in this case.'

Brennan found Masten in contempt of court.

'The court would be remiss to turn a blind eye to a flagrant refusal to honor a court order, and give more value to an individual’s opinion on what is right, rather than to the dictates of the laws enacted by the people of Florida,' Brennan wrote.

Masten will appear in court again next week and could be sentenced to two weeks in prison.

He said the tip could reveal the identity of the tipster - something the judge in the case was going to decide upon

The tip was anonymous, so the name of the tipster would not have been revealed
