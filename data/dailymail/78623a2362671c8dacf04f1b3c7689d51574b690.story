Last week, I received a very strange invite asking me to come down to a TV studio packed with men and women and then, in the full glare of the spotlight, to publicly grab my own crotch.

Usually this sort of behaviour gets your collar felt by the long arm of the law for indecent exposure but on this occasion I was assured it would be all for a good cause.

That cause turned out to be the Check One Two movement's #FeelingNuts campaign, which aims to persuade men to regularly check their tackle for testicular cancer regularly.

Clearly, it is a most worthy campaign and so, I was happy to get involved.

Worthy cause: Spencer was invited to grab his crotch as part of the #FeelingNuts movement

Over 2,000 new cases of testicular cancer are found each year in the UK, mostly in men from age 20-39 (so that's me included), but thankfully this cancer has a relatively high chance of being cured, as long as you detect it early enough - hence this big awareness campaign for men to check their goolies.

So all you have to do is this.

Send a twitter picture or video, or some other social media platform that you communicate on posting: 'I'm #Feelingnuts' and then add something funny/witty/whatever and the all important #FeelingNuts and then challenge another couple of friends (girls and boys) to do the crotch grab challenge as well. 

Spreading the word: Spencer and co-star Jamie Laing attended the #FeelingNuts event at the O2 Arena 

Feeling charitable: Spencer was keen to get on board with the charity as he says it is a very worthy cause

Also while you're down there it would be a good idea to check your gonads for any strange bumps which could be cancer.

The Twitter campaign is building fast and so far Ricky Gervais, Jack Whitehall, Alan Carr, Hugh Jackman and even William Shatner have posted pictures of themselves delicately cupping their genitals.

More celebrity support turned up for the #FeelingNuts event  at the O2 Arena in London's Docklands, which I was at, along with my Made In Chelsea colleague Jamie Laing and  Jack Whitehall who was hosting the event.

Important issues: While there Spencer and Jamie were interviewed by Fresh Meat actor Greg McHugh

Awkard: Spencer says that his interview with Hugh was probably one of his most uncomfortable ones to date

We were interviewed by Jack's former co-star on E4 drama Fresh Meat, actor Greg McHugh, who plays Howard on the show. 

Greg did the interview in the style of the Howard – the very nerdy and socially inept Scottish geology student.

It was possibly the most painful interview I've ever done but was nowhere near as awkward and grabbing my own crotch in front of the 200-strong predominantly female crowd. 

Luckily it appeared to go down well with the audience. But I won't be making a habit of it.
