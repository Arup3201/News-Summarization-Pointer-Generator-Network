A group tasked with protecting the welfare of animals in the film industry blasted as 'misleading' a report suggesting it turns a blind eye to abuse because it is too cosy with Hollywood.

The Hollywood Reporter listed alleged incidents on films including the Oscar-winning 'Life Of Pi', where it said the Bengal tiger which is central to the movie nearly drowned.

Twenty-seven animals involved in making the first movie of the Hobbit trilogy died, it said, also listing incidents where a chipmunk was squashed, a husky dog was punched, and fish died in making 'Pirates Of The Caribbean'.

But the American Humane Association 
(AHA) said the story 'distorts the work and record of a respected 
nonprofit organization that has kept millions of beloved animal actors 
safe on film and television sets around the world.'

'The
article is misleading and unfortunate,' AHA senior advisor Karen Rosa 
told AFP.

'I really think that the article does not paint a very 
accurate picture of the program and the hard work that we do out there 
in the field.'

'The 
article paints a picture that is completely unrecognizable to us or 
anyone who knows (our) work,' added the group, which confers the 'No animals were harmed' stamp listed at the end of films it has monitored.

In
its latest issue the Hollywood Reporter quotes an AHA monitor about an 
incident in which Richard Parker, the tiger which shares a shipwrecked 
lifeboat in Taiwanese director Ang Lee's 'Life Of Pi', allegedly nearly 
drowned.

In an email, the 
monitor recounted how the tiger 'got lost trying to swim to the side,' 
adding: 'Damn near drowned... I think this goes without saying but DON'T
MENTION IT TO ANYONE, ESPECIALLY THE OFFICE!'

'That
was unfortunate,' conceded AHA advisor Rosa, referring to the email.

'We believe that she exaggerated. But the bottom line was ... the animal
did not suffer any harm.

'Cats are good swimmers!' she added.

The
industry journal also cited the case of a horse dying in the making of 
Steven Spielberg's Oscar-nominated 2011 film 'War Horse', and dozens of 
fish washed after special effects explosions on the 'Pirates of the 
Caribbean' set.

A Spielberg 
spokesman said the Hollywood Reporter story was exaggerated, but 
essentially accurate in terms of its description of what happened on 
'War Horse'.

'What they 
wrote was essentially what happened,' spokesman Marvin Levy told AFP.

'But there was no cover up ... the whole story is rather exaggerated in 
many places.

'Safety was the prime consideration throughout the entire film,' he said.

The
industry journal's lengthy investigation claimed the AHA has a 
fundamental conflict of interest, because its funding came from two 
industry bodies.

Rosa said 
the group got about two thirds of its funding from industry, but 
insisted: 'Those funds are neutral. Nobody tells us what sets we can 
monitor, how we're to monitor them.'

'Far
from allowing abuse or neglect to occur, we have a remarkably high 
safety record of 99.98 percent on set,' added the AHA statement.

It
acknowledged that accidents did occur. 'Over a span of many years, 
despite our best efforts, there have occasionally been rare accidents, 
most of them minor and not intentional.'

But
Bob Ferber, a veteran LA prosecutor who ran a city Animal Protection 
Unit, told the Hollywood Reporter: 'It's fascinating and ironic: from 
being the protectors of animals they've become complicit to animal 
cruelty.'
