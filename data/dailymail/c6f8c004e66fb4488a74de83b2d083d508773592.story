A performance artist has given her baby son the greatest art debut possible - after he was born inside a gallery as part of a live exhibition.

The Microscope Gallery in Brooklyn, New York, said Marni Kotak's son Ajax was healthy and weighed 9lbs 2oz when he was born yesterday at 10.17am.

The 36-year-old artist - who said giving birth is the 'highest form of art' - had set up a home-birth centre at the gallery.

Art: The website of The Microscope Gallery in Brooklyn, New York, where Marni Kotak gave birth announced that the child was a healthy baby boy, weighing 9lbs 2oz

She had turned the space into a brightly decorated bedroom with ocean blue walls and photo-imprinted pillows.

The gallery would not confirm how many people witnessed the birth, but an audience of 15 had been expected.

Katarina Hybenova wrote on bushwickdaily.com that Kotak experienced the 'unforgettable moment' surrounded by a small group of family members, friends and 'handful of randomly chosen participants'.

She said: 'I was one of the lucky ones attending, and the atmosphere in the gallery was magical. I believe that all of the participants were deeply moved by this emotional, raw and true 'piece of art'.

'I feel like the entire audience accomplished this together with Marni, using the commonly created positive energy.'

Araceli Cruz, of the VillageVoice blog, said she just missed out on witnessing the birth. She also revealed, in a post, that the baby was to be called Ajax, and that he measured 21 inches long.

All set: Marni is now terrified of the media attention but her painter-artist husband Jason Robert Bell spoke briefly Wednesday

She said: 'We first received notice that the baby was coming soon at 9.34am and rushed to the quaint gallery.

'Although
 we were one of the select few to attend the live birth, an art 
performance/installation by Marni Kotak, we, unfortunately, didn't 
arrive in time.

'What we did find when we entered the steamy space, which the artist converted into a birthing centre, was Kotak calmly eating a banana, the placenta in a bowl and the baby's father, Jason, holding his son who was wrapped in a blue towel.

'The beautiful baby boy was wide-eyed, and as quiet as could be, staring blankly into the camera and video lenses that hovered above him.'

A video of the birth will be added to forthcoming exhibition at the gallery, and forms the start of an 18 year project which called Raising Baby X, where Kotak will document her child's upbringing until college with weekly video podcasts.

Kotak launched the exhibition on October 8 and the gallery's opening hours were extended so that she could develop a rapport with members of the public.

She and her painter-husband, Jason Bell, did not know the baby's gender prior to the birth. She said, last week, that those who had spent time talking to her about motherhood, birth and art and learning about the project would be notified when she went into labour.

And she also revealed that, if she went into labour at home then she would move to the gallery.

She said she did not plan to talk to her audience, but that: 'I never know how a performance will progress and sometimes unexpected things happen.'

Marni, whose childhood was spent in Norwood, Massachusetts, said all her performances focused on everyday life experiences.

She has been re-enacting events from her life for more than 10 years, including her own birth, losing her virginity in 'a sunny blue Plymouth' and her grandfather's funeral.

Jill McDermid, a curator and co-director of the performance art Grace Exhibition Space in Brooklyn, called Marni's work 'daring, challenging and honest.' And she said people should not be shocked.

No photographs or video were taken of the birth, as only Mr Bell was allowed to film so that the exhibition will be unique. The exhibition runs until November 7.

Ready: The gallery has been converted into a birthing room for Marni
