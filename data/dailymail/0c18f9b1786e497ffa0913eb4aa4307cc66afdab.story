The kosher supermarket in Paris which was targeted by terrorists has reopened two months after four hostages were killed as part of an Islamist plot.

Amedy Coulibaly, who pledged allegiance to ISIS, slaughtered customers at the Hyper Cacher shop  in January as part of a coordinated attack on the French capital with the Charlie Hebdo gunmen.

There were sombre scenes as the Jewish grocery reopened yesterday morning to 'show that life is stronger than barbarity'.

With many of the store's staff still on leave because of shock, new manager Laurent Mimoun wore a black kippa as he opened the doors.

He said: 'There we are, we are open again. 

'We are thinking about all the victims, this has been the driver behind reopening the shop.'

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve was among the government officials present at the reopening, which took place under heavy police surveillance.

'It is important to pay respect to the memory of those who fell under the fire of barbarity,' Mr Cazeneuve said.

'This foodstore reopens bravely to show that life is stronger than everything. [The French government will] 'do everything so that all French people can live freely.'

Terrorist: Amedy Coulibaly, who pledged allegiance to ISIS, slaughtered customers at the Hyper Cacher shop in January

The Hyper Cacher shop was attacked in January as part of a coordinated assault on the French capital, days after 12 were killed at the officers of Charlie Hebdo magazine

Four were killed by Coulibaly before the French security services stormed the kosher grocery, killing the Islamist

Terrorist Coulibaly burst into the supermarket in Porte de Vincennes on January 9 - two days after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed 12 at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hedbdo.

Coulibaly killed four Jews - Philippe Braham, 45, Yohan Cohen, 22, Yoav Hattab, 21, and François-Michel Saada, 64 - before French security services ended the siege in a hail of bullets, shooting the Islamist dead.

The supermarket has been completely refurbished and bears no trace of the deadly attack. 

The Hyper Cacher group said in a statement that the reopening was a sign of the resilience of France's Jewish community.

'With (this) we reaffirm that life will always be stronger than barbarity. We are more determined than ever to allow our clients to eat kosher,' the statement said.
