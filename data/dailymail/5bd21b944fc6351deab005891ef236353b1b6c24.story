Amanda Knox is likely to be freed, according to one of the lawyers opposing her murder appeal.

A prosecutor in the Amanda Knox appeal case has said 'an ill wind is blowing' as she predicted the American would be acquitted of the murder of Meredith Kercher.

Manuela Comodi, who is one of two prosecutors involved in the appeal of Knox against her conviction for the murder of student Meredith, 21, said she was convinced the American would be freed.

Comodi made her comments just hours before the appeal hearing resumed today, with prosecutors and defence lawyers again contesting crucial DNA evidence.

Hopeful: Amanda Knox, seen here at her appeal hearing in Perugia, is another step closer to freedom after a judge's ruling today

Knox, 24, is serving 26 years for the murder of Meredith, 21, who was found with her throat slashed and semi naked in the bedroom of the house she shared with her and two other women in November 2007.

Her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 27, was also convicted of murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith and he is serving 25 years with both claiming they had nothing to do with the killing.

Miss Comodi said: 'There is an ill wind blowing in this case.

'The judge and his assistant are clearly against us. I can see both Knox and Sollecito being freed which will be a shame as they are both involved.'

The prosecutor spoke as the judge in the case denied her a further re-examination of forensic evidence.

An earlier review had cast doubt on DNA findings used by the prosecution.

Key to the case is a 30cm kitchen knife found at Sollecito's apartment, on which DNA from Knox was on the handle and that of Meredith was discovered on the blade.

However the independent report by Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conte of Rome's La Sapeinza University has questioned the reliability of the findings by forensic scientists.

Although they do not doubt Knox's DNA is on the handle they have questioned the findings related to Meredith, insisting that the level is so low it should not have been admitted as evidence in the first trial.

The experts have also questioned the 
reliability of DNA evidence found on Meredith's bloodied bra clasp which
was found at the scene and then 'missed' for six weeks.

The
original trial heard there were traces of Sollecito on the clasp after 
it was examined by forensic scientists but the experts say the fact it 
was left for six weeks at the scene leaves it open to contamination.

Police
forensic scientist Patrizia Stefanoni, who led the original 
investigation, has dismissed any suggestion of contamination and 
insisted she and her team followed strict guidelines.

However,
earlier in the appeal the court was shown a video which showed the 
forensic team collecting evidence with dirty gloves and using their 
hands instead of tweezers to collect items.

Comodi added: 'We are going to ask for a second review of the evidence. There are to many aspects that are incomplete and we believe the experts are wrong so we want another review.

'This could take another sixty days but I'm not confident that the judge will grant the prosecution request - it's very obvious this time that they are against us.'

Comodi said that the tests, if granted, would be carried out using new techniques which had not previously been available when the first tests were carried out almost four years ago.

She also said she would request that Mafia mobster Luciano Avielli who had earlier testified that Knox and Sollecito were innocent of the murder be called back.

Aviello has told the hearing that it was his on-the-run brother and fellow mobster Antonio who had carried out the killing after he was disturbed by Meredith during a botched break in.

Comodi said: 'Aviello was a key witness for the defence in this appeal but he has now contacted me to retract everything he said so it is only right that we ask for him to be called back so he can testify again.'

The findings of the review had given hope to Knox and Sollecito that they would be acquitted at the end of September when the court is expected to give its verdict.

However a request to have a second review plus Aviello heard again could delay a verdict by as much as two months, meaning no decision before November at the earliest - four years after Meredith was murdered.

After the hearing Knox's father Curt, said: 'I'm very happy with the decision to stick with the original independent review - it's a tell tale of how the court feels the report was effective.

'The court truly believes in what the experts have told them. We are still hopeful and this tells me that the court believes what these experts are saying.

'Amanda is happy and hopeful that she won't be spending too much more time in prison but it's still up to the judges in the court and we will start those arguments later this month.

'These were court appointed experts and if you ask me it looks like an act of desperation from the prosecution. I personally didn't believe that another review was necessary.

'It seems as if they are unwilling to listen to common sense - there was no trace of Amanda or Raffaele in the room where Meredith was murdered.

'The prosecution should be seeking the truth and I'm sure that is something the Kerchers would want.'

Meredith, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was in Perugia as part of her Leeds University and had only been in Italy for two months before she was brutally murdered.

A third defendant, small-time drug dealer Rudy Guede, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, was also jailed in connection with the brutal killing.

He was handed a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual violence following a fast-track trial in October 2008 which was later cut to 16 years.
