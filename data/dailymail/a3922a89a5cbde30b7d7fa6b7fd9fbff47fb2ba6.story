Households are spending more than ever on television, broadband and phone packages, a survey has shown, forking out an average of £50 a month.

In all, Britons spend a record total of £3.3 billion on the deals.

People waste an average of £16 a month on unwatched TV channels, but this has decreased since last year.

The report also found that almost one 
in five UK bundle users is spending an additional £10 per month for 
online TV subscriptions.

Nearly two-thirds (62%) of those 
questioned said they have no idea how much internet data they actually 
use, while almost a third of respondents (29%) do not know what capacity
 they are paying for.

Guy North, spokesman for Freeview – which commissioned the Vision and Value 2014 survey with the Post Office – said:  ‘A considerable amount of cash is wasted on unwatched channels.

‘People should assess their viewing habits to ensure they are getting value for money from their TV service.’

Post Office spokesman Hugh Stacey added: 'Bigger isn't necessarily better. Even though consumers are accessing greater levels of content online, most households require just a sixth of the capacity that they are paying for.'
