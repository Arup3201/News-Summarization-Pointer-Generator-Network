A hero trucker in Mississippi ran towards a blazing car wreck on the freeway with hardly a second thought to save the driver and her one-year-old granddaughter, while others stayed in the safety of their cars and watched.

The incredible bravery of David Fredericksen was captured on the dashcam of his truck last Monday in the aftermath of an explosive crash that occurred when the grandmother T-boned an 18-wheeler on the I10 near Biloxi while trying to merge.

The firey crash unfolds in front of Fredericksen, who pulls to a halt on the road and then calmly picks up a fire extinguisher, exits his truck and runs towards the debris not knowing what awaits him as smoke billows from the car.

Not a second thought: David Fredericksen said 
that he did what anyone else would have done - despite evidence to the 
contrary filmed on his dashcam

While other car drivers sit still inside their vehicles on road that is strewn with liter from the crash, married father-of-three Frederickson begins to tackle the flames billowing from the car.

His actions inspire his co-drivers, who burst from the cab of their truck and run towards their brave friend and lend a hand.

Four men, including Fredericksen's son come to his aid and the five men manage to pull the woman and her granddaughter away from the car to safety before it descends into a raging inferno.

Everyone survived, although the unidentified grandmother suffered a broken leg during the smash.

Speaking to Jalopnik, Fredericksen was humble when discussing his heroism in the face of danger.

'I don't feel it's heroic,' he said. 'Really what I feel is when I first got out of the truck, I was praying that they wouldn't be dead. I just wanted to put the fire out, but when I saw they were alive, I was like 'SWEET!'

'I was praying to myself. I really didn't want to have to see somebody dead,' he added. Other people would've done what I did.'

As the men watch the crash unfold, when it seems like the driver of the Lincoln Towncar drives the wrong way down the freeway before trying to merge, they yelp as the 18-wheeler and car collide.

Eventually the police arrive and Fredericksen and his friends and those they rescued can be seen to the right by the verge

'Thankfully my father had the presence of mind, bravery, and forethought of carrying a fire extinguisher, to be the first person on scene to risk his own life in order to possibly save another and to inspire others and lead them into taking action,' said Fredericksen's son on YouTube.

'Everyone involved in the rescue effort is a hero in my books.'

Fredericksen told Jalopnik that as he approached the Lincoln he saw the driver trying to kick out the door, even though she had a broken leg.

While he rescued the stricken grandmother, his friend and co-driver pulled the little girl to safety.

'She was the cutest little thing, too,' he said to Jalopnik. 'She was hugging him so tight she was choking him.'

'I'm just glad that they didn't die, you know?'

Average day: David Frederickson and his passengers were driving along I 10 in Mississippi when the accident unfolded in front of them

Impact: In the distance the Lincoln Towncar has collided with the 18-wheeler and detonated the gas containers on the side of the huge truck

Inferno: The truck driven by Fredericksen comes to a halt as the devastation wrought by the crash is left strewn across the freeway

Not my problem: The driver of the truck pictured in the center drives through the smoke and past the flaming Lincoln without stopping

Gone: The white truck can be seen driving on past the fiery wreck on the right, while the pick-up on the left and SUV on the right park up

Asked what inspired him to risk his life to save the crash survivors, Frederickson said that his religion helped him.

'I trusted in God when I went there. It could've blown up and killed me. He's got a plan for me, because after I got back to the truck my hands were shaking,' said Frederickson to Jalopnik.

'My actions were because of my love for God and love for people. Because it does make a difference.

'If anyone learns anything from it, I want them to know, if they see these trucks out there, they're not bad people with aggressive drivers.'Â
