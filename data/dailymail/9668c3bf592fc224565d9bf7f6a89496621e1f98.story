A speaker drew applause from mourners at the funeral of a district attorney and his wife who were shot dead, when he said of their killers: 'Chase 'em down. Go get 'em. Bring 'em to justice... Take them out of the hole they come from.'

Chris Heisler made the remarks as he led an emotional memorial service on Thursday for Mike and Cynthia McLelland who were murdered in their Texas home near Forney last Saturday.

Loved ones remembered the couple's love, warmth and public service as police continue to hunt for their killers. Dozens of law enforcement officers and 
public officials, including Texas Governor Rick Perry, were among the 
hundreds who attended the service.

According to CNN, an affidavit on Thursday revealed further details of the investigations into the couple's deaths.

Friends reportedly found the bodies of the DA and his wife after going to their home on Saturday evening, having not heard from them in almost 24 hours. They were found with multiple gunshot wounds.

Police have requested phone records for the McLellands for the last two months to see if more can be discovered about the days leading up to the fatal attack.

At their funeral service on Thursday, Mr and Mrs McLelland shared a single, flag-draped casket inside the suburban church.

McLelland had addressed many of the 
same people two months earlier, after the slaying of Mark Hasse, one of 
his prosecutors. Hasse was gunned down near the Kaufman County 
courthouse while going to work.

The deaths are feared to be planned attacks by violent white supremacist gang, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas.

McLelland was pivotal in the prosecution of a senior member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas last year who received two life terms following a shoot out.

No arrests have been made in either case. The reward for information leading to a conviction has been doubled to $200,000.

Mrs McLelland's remains were cremated and placed inside the coffin with the body of her husband, the Kaufman County district attorney.

Friends and colleagues at the service described the couple as the perfect mismatch: an outgoing Army veteran known for his wit and humor, and a quieter partner who loved quilting and supported her husband's work.

Christina Foreman, one of the five children the couple shared, said both her mother and stepfather 'loved 
every minute' of their public service. She challenged the audience to 
stand up for what they believe in.

Ms Foreman said:' They would have done it exactly the same way, because Mike believed in making a difference.'

Bruce Bryant, chief investigator for the district attorney's office, broke down in tears as he remembered his former boss.

'We will not stop pursuing justice,' Mr Bryant said. 'We will not give up the good fight. We will not stop doing God's work. We will pause only to celebrate the lives of those we have lost, but we will not stop.'

Surrounding the McLellands' casket were mementos of their life together - portraits, a soldier's jacket from Mike McLelland's Army service and a quilt to commemorate one of Cynthia's favorite hobbies.

Two officers stood watch as dozens more sat in the audience. Officers in the balcony behind the stage could be seen raising white-gloved hands to their eyes during the service.

Governor Perry said he had spoken to McLelland weeks earlier at the state Capitol in Austin.

Perry credited both McLellands for their public service - Mike as a 20-year Army veteran and district attorney and Cynthia as a nurse who worked at a state hospital. Perry said both were aware of the dangers of the district attorney's job.

'It's an art form. It's a calling, and one of the more difficult ones, I imagine,' Perry said in a quiet, sometimes halting voice.

Perry later presented Mrs McLelland's mother Shirley Woodward with the flag which she clasped close to her.

Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood, the county's chief administrative official, said he got to know Mike McLelland while the two were campaigning for office three years ago.

'I knew immediately how intelligent he was,' Wood said. 'But he was quite a character too.'

Friends remembered Mike ribbing a pastor about the length of his sermons and Cynthia repeatedly going back to one store to buy gifts for relatives and friends.

They also recalled Mike running a tough campaign for district attorney - and his drive to prosecute criminals and pursue justice.

'If Cynthia was all warmth and motherhood, Mike was a warrior,' Bryant said.

In the months after Hasse was killed, McLelland began to carry a gun everywhere and took extra caution when answering his door.

He told The Associated Press in an interview shortly before his death that he was warning his employees that they needed to be more cautious as well.

'The people in my line of work are going to have to get better at it,' he said of dealing with the danger, 'because they're going to need it more in the future'.

Several people on Thursday remembered that spirit of persistence and defiance.

Standing in front of the casket, Foreman told the audience they had a responsibility not to let fear stop them from fighting to do right thing.

She said she believed her mother and stepfather had prepared her for this moment, when she and her siblings must go on without them.

'The right thing is never easy,' Foreman said. She added: 'And he knew that. And he stood up anyway.'
