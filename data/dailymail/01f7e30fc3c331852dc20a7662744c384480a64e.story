A Rabbi at the famed Los Angeles Kabbalah Center, attended by stars including Madonna and Ashton Kutcher, has been accused of sexually assaulting and threatening a woman.

Yehuda Berg, the co-director of the center, is being sued by Jena Scaccetti, who claimed that her former spiritual adviser had groped her in October 2012.

Ms Scaccetti alleged that when she rejected his advances, Berg became angry and said he would 'f***ing kill' her.

Berg, a father-of-five, allegedly attempted to assault Ms Scaccetti after inviting her to dinner at his mother's apartment where he claimed he would be able to heal her kidney stones, TMZ reported.

When she arrived, Ms Scaccetti claimed she was given Vicodin and alcohol by Berg, who was complaining about his life and other teachers at the Kabbalah Center.

Berg allegedly started to ask inappropriate questions, asking Ms Scaccetti if she had a Brazillian wax or if she was shaved. He then started to hug her and touch her legs, she claims.

Ms Scaccetti is suing for $1.5 million as well as $40 million in punitive damages.

Berg and the Kabbalah Center have not yet responded to a Mail Online request for comment.
