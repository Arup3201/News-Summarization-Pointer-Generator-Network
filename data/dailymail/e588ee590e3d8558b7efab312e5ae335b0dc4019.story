Stephen Lawrence: Secret Metropolitan Police unit the Special Demonstration Squad compiled information on the murdered teenager's family

A rogue undercover police unit ‘hoovered up’ a staggering amount of personal details during 40 years of secretive missions, a damning report revealed yesterday.

Members of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) compiled information about at least 18 justice campaigns, many made up of relatives fighting for the truth after the deaths of victims from ethnic minorities.

But much of the intelligence they gathered was no more than worthless ‘community gossip’.

Some Scotland Yard commissioners and their most senior colleagues were ‘possibly negligent’ in their lack of knowledge of the unit’s existence, the report’s author claimed.

Yesterday, the chief constable leading the unprecedented inquiry into undercover policing said some top officers would face misconduct proceedings if they were still serving.

The undercover officers themselves could face prosecution over illicit sexual affairs they had with targets and their appearances in court under false identities.

Mick Creedon, who is conducting the inquiry, known as Operation Herne, criticised senior Metropolitan Police officers as being complacent and ‘possibly negligent’ in their failure to oversee the activities of the SDS.

He said: ‘We have spoken to officers who held the rank of commissioner and deputy commissioner along with other very senior officers involved in covert policing and public order and the vast majority of them knew nothing of the existence of SDS.

‘This is astonishing given the suggested pivotal role the SDS played in reporting on violence and extremism and preventing disorder and the question has to be asked about the lack of executive scrutiny, of intrusive senior management and of effective supervision.’

The latest revelations about the controversial unit sparked fresh outrage about the activities of undercover officers.

Investigators discovered officers gathered information about the families of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence; Jean Charles de Menezes, who was shot dead by police after being mistaken for a suicide bomber; and mother-of-eight Cherry Groce, whose shooting sparked the Brixton riots in 1985.

Some of those targeted said they will consider suing the Met again and one mother said she felt ‘stripped of my dignity’.

Mr Creedon said his staff spoke to three former commissioners and an unknown number of their deputies and assistants.

He declined to name them, but Lord Blair was in charge when Mr de Menezes was shot dead by police at Stockwell Tube station in 2005. Lord Condon and Lord Stevens occupied the commissioner’s office when the unit was reporting back on private matters involving the Lawrence family.

The report found SDS officers improperly gathered and stored information on at least 18 justice campaigns between 1970 and 2005.

But Mr Creedon said no documentary evidence or witnesses have been found to substantiate claims that the SDS deliberately targeted grieving families.

Operation Herne was sparked by incendiary claims last year from Peter Francis, a former undercover officer, in the Guardian that a spy was ordered to smear the Lawrence family.

But Mr Francis repeatedly refused to be interviewed by Herne investigators, and Mr Creedon said: ‘There is no witness or documentary evidence that supports those allegations.’

He said SDS officers were never directly tasked to infiltrate or inform on families, but were targeting violent factions who wanted to hijack their justice campaigns.

Mr Creedon said worthless information of no value to criminal probes was stored, for example details of someone attending a funeral.

The Derbyshire chief said such information should have been destroyed, in line with modern laws governing secretive police operations and people’s right to privacy.

The undercover police saga is far from over, as prosecutors examine whether officers perverted the course of justice by using false identities in court. There may also be criminal charges arising from sexual relationships between officers and activists.

Mr Creedon said his team has another 12 months of work as they scour archives of secret material.

Met Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said: ‘I regret enormously the distress that has been caused to families.’
