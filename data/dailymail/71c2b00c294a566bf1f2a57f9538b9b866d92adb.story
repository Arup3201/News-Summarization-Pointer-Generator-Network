Father-of-one Richard Brown, 48, was killed as he unloaded pallets containing heavy kitchen worktops at an industrial estate.

'The agency, which he worked for, wanted to know if they could be of any assistance after the tragic news about Richard,' said devastated Ms Tribe, aged 44.

'No one had told me about the accident. I rang Richard's mobile. It just rang out. I rang the agency back and they came straight round.

'They were mortified. They honestly thought I'd been told. I don't blame them.

'It has destroyed us. I'm still numb and in shock.'

Cumbria Police and the Health and Safety Executive are carrying out a joint investigation into the industrial accident at Howdens Joinery depot in Workington, Cumbria.

Mr Brown was making his second or third delivery on November 10, for the kitchen suppliers when the accident happened. 

The air ambulance along with a land ambulance, medical director, four fire engines the police responded to the 999 call at 1.30pm.

A spokesman for North West Ambulance Service spokesman said Mr Brown was trapped under a number of pallets.

'Richard went off to work quite happy,' said Ms Tribe. 

'He had been wearing his new work boots and hi-vis jacket.

'Workington was his second or third drop.'

'He was always ringing people up.

'He told me, 'I'll unload this lot and I'll ring you back'.'

Ms Tribe said she became worried when Mr Brown failed to call her back.

'I rang his mobile five times and left a message asking if he was OK,' she said.

'It was really unlike him not to ring back.' 

After learning of her partner's death the hairdresser had to break the news to his son, Dominik, 17, a former Hull City academy footballer.

Mr Brown's nephew, Martin Oliver, 41, said his London-born uncle had not intended to work that shift.

'Richard was on nights, but agreed to do the agency a favour by working that shift,' he said.

'He shouldn't even have been in Workington.' 

'Richard was a good man - very hardworking and likeable. Wherever you went, people would know him.

'But without doubt the biggest, most important thing in his life was Dominik. He loved him to pieces. The two of them could not have been closer. 

'He was known by some people as 'Cockney' because he was from London originally,' said Mr Oliver. 'Everyone loved him.' 

A spokesman for Howdens Joinery said that the company had launched their own internal investigation into the incident.
