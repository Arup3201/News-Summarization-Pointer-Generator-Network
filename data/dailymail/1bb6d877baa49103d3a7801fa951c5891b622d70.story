Compensation: Award-winning actor David John Birrell, 46, says he was robbed of his good looks after being shot in the eye on-stage with a replica gun. He has filed a £250,000 damages claim

An award-winning actor who says he was robbed of his good looks after being shot in the eye on-stage with a replica gun has filed a £250,000 damages claim.

David John Birrell, 46, was blinded in his right eye and left with an 'unsightly' disfigurement when a blank-firing replica Colt 1851 Navy revolver he was using in an on-stage duel backfired during a West End production.

Mr Birrell, from Nunhead, South London, is now suing London-based theatre company Donmar Warehouse Projects Ltd, claiming the 'cosmetic disability' he suffered has blighted his career as well as his personal life.

The theatre company has admitted 
liability for the accident under health and safety at work regulations, 
guaranteeing Mr Birrell will receive a payout.

However
Donmar Warehouse denies negligence and is seeking a contribution to the
damages from the prop specialists who they say supplied the gun, 
History in the Making Ltd, of, Waterlooville, Hampshire.

As part of the claim, lodged at the High Court in London, Mr Birrell’s barrister, Stephen Friday, says that the actor suffered 'total and permanent blindness in the right eye' after a blank cartridge in the gun he was firing 'ejected rearwards and at high velocity through the breach cut into the revolver and into his right eye.'

The accident, which took place during a production of the Stephen Sondheim play ‘Passion’ at the Donmar Warehouse, in Covent Garden in October 2010, left Mr Birrell with a 'blind right eye' which is 'shrunken and unsightly,' forcing him to now wear 'a cosmetic shell' to disguise its appearance, the document states.

The prosthetic eye 'looks as if it is staring (and) looks sunken in appearance' which, coupled with 'scarring and distortion', means 'the overall effect is of marked asymmetry to the upper half of Mr Birrell’s face.'

Injury: The accident took place during a production of the Stephen Sondheim play 'Passion' at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden

Mr Friday states that Mr Birrell has 
undergone counselling due to his condition and is now at a disadvantage 
on the labour market.

It is also claimed that the actor has 'lost the facility of binocular vision, has difficulty judging distances and with hand-eye coordination, tends to collide with objects on his right hand side' and that his 'previous interests of photography, cycling fencing running swimming and squash were curtailed.'

In their defence to the action, Derek O’Sullivan, for Donmar Warehouse, admits that the theatre company are liable under the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998.

Mr O’Sullivan states that it is 'accepted' that Mr Birrell suffered an eye injury but that the theatre company is reserving its position as to its extent and severity.

The Donmar is also reserving the right to claim against the prop specialists, who are a third party in the action, stating that they have never had the chance to have the gun examined as is was 'seized almost immediately after the accident by Camden Borough Council as part of a criminal investigation, which did not result in a prosecution and has never been returned.'

In their defence, lawyers for History in the Making state that the guns supplied had been serviced and cleaned prior to supply to the theatre.

Accident: This Colt Navy 1851 is similar to the replica gun which half blinded actor David Birrell

They claim additionally that, in the circumstances of the accident, the contract between History in the Making and the theatre company meant that 'allocation of risk for any accident causing injury is placed on Donmar Warehouse'.

History in the Making add that, 'it is currently unknown whether the gun used by Mr Birrell in the accident was one of those supplied by History in the Making and Donmar Warehouse are required to prove that it was.'

They go on to claim that 'the principle factor which led to the ejection event was the use by Donmar Warehouse of defective ammunition which was not supplied by History in the Making.'

They conclude that what happened to Mr Birrell was 'an accident, the circumstances of which were both outside the control of History in the Making and not reasonably foreseeable at the time of supply.'

Mr Birrell who is currently appearing in two productions for the Open Air theatre company in London’s Regents Park, won the Critics’ Award for Theatre in Scotland, the Best Male Performance 2010/11 Award for his portrayal of Sweeney Todd.

He was also nominated for the 2010 TMA Award for Best Performance in a Musical.
