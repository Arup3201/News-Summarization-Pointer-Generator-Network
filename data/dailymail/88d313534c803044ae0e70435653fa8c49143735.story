Gliding delicately across the crystal waters of a Siberian lake, these swans to and fro in perfect unison as if in a tightly-choreographed dance routine.

But that may come as little surprise to those who know the lagoon, in northern Russia, where it is known as Swan Lake, in an affectionate tribute to the world-famous ballet.

The stunning images were taken by Russian photographer Alexander Tyryshkin on Svetloe Lake, near Urozhainoe, which is a popular destination for Siberian Whooper Swans because it never freezes, no matter how cold the winter gets.

'It was minus 25C when I was taking pictures of the swans', Tyryshkin, 30, who lives and works in this part of Siberia, told the Siberian Times. 'Svetloe is a very special lake, fed by many warm springs that keep the water always above zero. Even when the air goes down to minus 40C, the water in the lake stays at around plus 5C or 6C.'

The waters of Svetloe, which means 'clear lake' in Russian, are so transparent that the bed can be seen from its surface, Tyryshkin said, adding that there are only two such lakes in all of Russia.

Favourite spot: He said the majestic birds were first sighted on the lake in 1967 and returned each year since, their numbers growing with every winter that passes

He said the majestic birds were first sighted on the lake in 1967 and returned each year since, their numbers growing with every winter that passes.

'The birds leave for nesting to the northern polar areas of Siberia in 
March, and come back here with their young some nine months later,' he added.

'People from the nearby village are very proud to have their own Swan Lake and treat the birds with enormous care and respect, and in return have the most rewarding swan songs (the bird is famous for its deep honking call) and the joy of watching them fly.'

Local pride: Tyryshkin says locals are proud to have their own Swan Lake and treat the birds with enormous care and respect

Coming back: In 1967, only 15 birds were recorded. Now they number 350 annually with the numbers rising each year

Inspiration? Svetlana Lunkina as Odette and the Corps de Ballet dance in the Bolshoi Ballet production of 'Swan Lake' at the Royal Opera House in 2006. Svetloe is locally named Swan Lake, like the famous ballet
