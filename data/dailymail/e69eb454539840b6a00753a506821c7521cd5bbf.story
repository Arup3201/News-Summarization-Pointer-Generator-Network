'A pipe has appeared to totally bust and there is water gushing, literally everywhere in the position of where all of the international press – everyone has moved out of the way,' said Catt Sadler. 'Rain was not expected in LA today, but we've got a little flooding!'

The flooding was apparently more like a malodorous deluge.

'We can confirm that there was a malfunction with a sprinkler near the red carpet,' read a statement from the posh Beverly Hilton Hotel, where the Golden Globes have been held--sewage free--for over 50 years.

'The situation was quickly resolved. Despite the incident the red carpet will open at its regularly scheduled time, the statement continued. ' As some of the biggest names in entertainment are scheduled to attend Golden Globe Awards tonight, we wanted to give the carpet one last wash before it opened.'
