Rio Ferdinand has hit back at Lord Ouseley after he accused the QPR defender of using Kick It Out as a ‘punchbag’ and selling a ‘book of trivia.’

Ferdinand believes that the anti-racism campaigners should have used the John Terry court case as an opportunity to support his family.

John Terry was found guilty by the FA of aiming racist abuse towards then QPR defender Anton Ferdinand

But the former England and Manchester United centre-back feels that they shied away at a crucial time.

Speaking at the launch of his #2sides book, Ferdinand said: ‘This was a huge world wide issue, all the cameras in the world were on it.

‘Over my career I’ve always been asked to wear a T-shirt and I’ve always done that to give the organisation that exposure it needs to keep spreading the word.

‘This opportunity comes and my question to them is you wear a T-shirt in the way to that court room. You let people know what this is about and that you’re here. 

Anton's older brother Rio Ferdinand partnered John Terry at the heart of England's defence for several years

‘Not just for my brother but you’re here for two brothers in a racism case. And you’re part of it, you’re the organisation there standing shoulder to shoulder with these guys. They didn’t.

‘If you went out and spoke to Joe Bloggs in the street and said, “What was the guy like? What was his name? Was there a guy from Kick It Out there?”

‘They wouldn’t be able to give you the slightest answer. Exposure, tell people you’re involved. Why’re you scared? They’ve been waiting for this type of case to give them exposure. This is the time. Why turn away from it?’

Ferdinand insisted he did not have a problem with Lord Ouseley and that he did not want argue with the Kick It Out chairman. 

Anton refused to shake the hand of  Terry during a match between QPR and Chelsea in September 2012

But he hopes that if a similar situation arises again they will make the most of it in future.

‘I haven’t got a feud with Lord Ouseley,’ he added. ‘He can say what he wants I’m not really bothered.

‘The time came for them to stand up, be there and be seen and they weren’t.

‘I hope when my kids get older and something like this happens that we all have learned from it and it’ll be dealt with a bit different.’
