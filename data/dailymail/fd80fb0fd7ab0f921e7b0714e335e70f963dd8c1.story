Thieves have stolen a $45,000 bronze statue of pioneering TV host Ed Sullivan from outside a Hollywood TV museum. 

The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed that the 18-inch high statue had been taken from outside the Academy of Television Arts and Science building in North Hollywood. 

The statue was on a pedestal outside the building when it was taken on Sunday. The 20 pound statue was part of a display of other famous television celebrities.

John Catalano of LAPD's North Hollywood Division told CBSLA.com: 'We’re looking at some of the video tape that we have from the area. We’re following up on some leads that we have and we’re hoping to get the statue returned to the Academy of Arts & Sciences as soon as we can.'

Vincent Precht, Sullivan's grandson told KCA9: 'My grandfather would be very proud and happy because he always liked a story and he always liked to be in the middle of a story To hear that his statue was taken, of course we want it back, but he would have liked it, I think.'

The Ed Sullivan show debuted in 1948 and continued until 1971, broadcasting on Sunday nights bringing many new artists to fame in the US. 

Sullivan's show was the first time the Beatles had been seen live in America. Elvis made his television debut on the show in 1956.  

The Ed Sullivan Show was responsible for introducing bands such as The Beatles, pictured, to US audiences
