The estranged wife of a multimillionaire New York investor admitted she hacked into her husband's private computer to prove he had spent hundreds of thousands in 'allowances' for young women.

Linda Simon used a private investigator to allegedly discover her husband David  had been accessing the website sugardaddy.com to conduct extramarital affairs.

Mrs Simon also claimed her husband gave $250,000 in 'hush money' to a woman he had a child with last year.

Bitter feud: The wife of David Simon, a multi-millionaire hedge funder, claims he squandered thousands on young women he met on sugardaddy.com

The couple are in the middle of a divorce at Westchester Family Court where Mrs Simon filed a protection order to have her husband kicked off their estate in Purchase, New York. 

Mr Simon is believed to have been living at the Setai Hotel, New York since the end of July.

In August, Mr Simon, who is a frequent commentator for CNBC, sued his wife and her divorce lawyer Jason Advocate for $25 million at Manhattan Civil Court.

He alleged they had copied his hard drive which contained 'trade secrets' from his company Twin Capital Management and his personal financial information.

Appeal: Linda Simon, estranged wife of financier David Simon, admitted she hacked his computer - but only so she could prove he was spending marital assets on young women he met on sugardaddy.com

The lawsuit said he was the only
person with the password and his company's computer-monitoring service 
showed someone accessed his PC after he left home.

Responding to the claims for the 
first time, Mrs Simon admitted that she broke into the 
computer with the help of surveillance firm T&M Protection Resources.

She said she only did so to find out about her husband's affairs and the money he lavished on young women.

According to the filing obtained by 
The New York Post, Mrs Simon stated: 'Simon was a ''sugar daddy'' to 
several young women through a Web site called sugardaddy.com and was 
spending thousands of dollars per week paying these women ''allowances''
to be at his beck and call.'

Upmarket: The Simons lived on an estate in Harrison County, New York before they began divorce proceedingss

Sugardaddy.com
has more than 1.5 million members and aims to set up rich, older men with young attractive women, so called 'sugar babies'.

Mr Simon's hedge fund tried to have Mr Advocate removed as Mrs Simon's lawyer as he was also been sued in the hacking case.

Mr Advocate was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline today.

The motion to have him dismissed as Mrs Simon's attorney was denied at Manhattan Civil Court yesterday by Judge Jeffrey Oing.

The lawsuit is ongoing with another court date scheduled for April 11 next year.
