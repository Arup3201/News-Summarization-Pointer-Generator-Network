A so-called early version of the Mona Lisa has gone on public display for the first time in 400 years - as experts revealed they have established a link between it and one of England's finest country homes.

A group of historians claim Leonardo da Vinci painted the work, dubbed the 'Early Mona Lisa', more than a decade before his masterpiece portrait and depicted the same Italian merchant's wife.

It was unearthed before the First World War but lay hidden in a Swiss bank vault for 40 years, while a consortium carried out secret tests before unveiling it in 2012 - though  many experts still insist it was one of a litany of inferior copies.

Today, as the painting's first public exhibition was unveiled in Singapore, the Swiss-based Mona Lisa Foundation claimed it has discovered new details about the painting's past which strengthen the view  it is by Da Vinci.

It was already known that it was bought from a Somerset aristocrat in 1913 by English art dealer Hugh Blaker, who kept it in his studio in Isleworth, south west London, before selling it to American   Henry Pulitzer in the 1960s. Before that, however, the painting's journey was a murky one.

Now the Foundation claims it has identified strong evidence that the Somerset  home where the painting was bought in 1913 could be Montacute House - one of England's finest Elizabethan mansions now run by the National Trust.

The claim, seen by the Reuters news agency, would fit if true. The Phelips family which owned Montacute fell on hard times and secretly sold their possessions just before the First World War, leaving the manor in 1911.

In 1915 the house was taken over by future Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon, and it was later put up for sale in 1929. By 1931 it was so dilapidated that it was being valued ‘for scrap’ at £5,882.

Diaries kept by Blaker - who tried several times unsuccessfully to have the painting authenticated - were lost, but the researchers say the brief references which remain to the house indicate it was Montacute.

Illustrious history: According to the Reuters news agency, the researchers have linked the painting for the first time to Montacute House, a grand Renaissance manor in Somerset now run by the National Trust. Its owners fell on hard times just before the work emerged in 1913

Grand: Appropriately enough, the manor - used to film Sense and Sensibility - now houses 60 works on loan from the National Portrait Gallery

Now that the house has been restored, it was used as a filming location for the 1995 version of Sense and Sensibility starring Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant, and its Long Gallery houses more than 60 Tudor and Elizabethan portraits on loan from the National Portrait Gallery in London. 

The Mona Lisa researchers also say they have traced the portrait's history before its possible arrival at Montacute.

In a communication passed to Reuters, they said they had found references to a painting called La Joconde - the French name for the Mona Lisa - in an art
exhibition in Yeovil, Somerset, in 1856.

The painting, which was sold to a silver
dealer two years later, also featured in a document declaring that young Somerset noble James Marwood owned a work by Da Vinci called La Joconde, which he probably bought on a visit to Italy around the 1780s.

Geneva-based auctioneer David Feldman, the Foundation's vice president, said: 'We feel these latest discoveries and new scientific
analysis just carried out leave little doubt that it is Da Vinci's work.

'The vast majority of experts now either agree with us or
accept that there is a strong case for our thesis'.

The painting is claimed to show a younger Lisa del Giacondo, the Florentine merchant's wife who is the subject of the slightly smaller Mona Lisa painting which now hangs in the Louvre in Paris.

The Mona Lisa Foundation says it was probably left unfinished by Da Vinci in 1505, before being completed and handed to Lisa's husband the following year.

That would make it more than a decade older than the better-known Mona Lisa, which was unveiled in 1517 before passing into the hands of the French royal family and, later, international legend.

The alleged earlier painting has been subject to X-rays and ultraviolet light scans to establish its age, and has been compared to Da Vinci's techniques - including his use of geometry in his famous Vitruvian Man sketch of 1490.

They  say it lacked a specific glazing technique which Da Vinci developed in 1508, and which was used in most of his paintings after that date.

It has earned the seal of approval, at least partially, from modern  experts including Renaissance historian Giorgio Vasari, art historian John Eyre, research physicist Professor John Asmus and Professor Alessandro Vezzosi, one of the most influential living experts on Da Vinci.

Not everyone is convinced the painting is a real work by the Italian master. There were several contemporary copies of the Mona Lisa, and historians have often suggested the so-called early version is just another one.

And although the Swiss-based Mona Lisa Foundation is described as being not for profit, its entire aim is to study the painting - which is now owned by an anonymous 'consortium', so it is difficult to establish who would benefit financially if it was declared a genuine Da Vinci.

One of the leading doubters of the painting's authenticity in 2012 was Oxford University art history professor Martin Kemp, who was instrumental in identifying a major work by Leonardo Da Vinci in 2010.

Although he had not personally seen the painting - also known as the Isleworth Mona Lisa after Blaker's studio - he said two years ago: 'The Isleworth Mona Lisa mistranslates subtle details of the original, including the sitter's veil, her hair, the translucent layer of her dress, the structure of the hands.

'The landscape is devoid of atmospheric subtlety. The head, like all other copies, does not capture the profound elusiveness of the original.'

He also said the Isleworth version was painted on canvas, and Da Vinci's preferred choice was wood.
