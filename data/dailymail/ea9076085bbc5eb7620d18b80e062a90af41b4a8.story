An Iowa couple are celebrating becoming millionaires after winning the $202.1 million jackpot on the Powerball.

Mary Lohse, 42, from Bondurant, thought she had only won $100 before realising the full extent of her massive windfall.

She called her husband Brian, 43, straight away with the incredible news.

But Mr Lohse, who was out of town on business and thinking the whole thing was some sort of joke, refused to believe her, saying 'If you’re telling the truth, go see our attorney'.

It is unsurprising that this was his advice as Mr Lohse 
himself is an attorney.

His wife works as a medical technician. But they
may well not be in their jobs for long, as they plan to retire early 
and bask instead in their new found wealth.

At
a press conference on Thursday, at the Iowa Lottery headquarters, Mrs 
Lohse pumped the air with a giant sponge finger as she and her husband 
were presented with their giant cheque.

Crowds threw hundred-dollar-bill confetti on the couple as the strode down a red carpet, hand in hand, to meet Iowa Lottery CEO Terry Rich.

They looked entirely overwhelmed as screams and whoops filled the room, looking around with giant beaming smiles on their faces.

Mrs Lohse told of her shock at the sudden landfall, since at first she thought just three of the numbers matched.

'I saw it the next day on the news,' she said. 'I caught the last three numbers as I was walking out the do and I thought I'd better have a close look when I get to work.

'did and I had the last three numbers and I was like well crap I think I won at least $100.'

Never having won before and not 
really knowing how these things work, Mrs Lohse telephoned the Powerball
helpline and was gobsmacked to learn that all of her number matched.

It was a fluke that she even bought the ticket, having heard on the news the day before filling up her car at the gas station that the jackpot was to be more than $200 million.

'I was like "I gotta remember to buy one," and I did,' she said proudly.

The couple chose a one-time payment, instead of a 30-year annuity, which reduced the gross prize to $129.8 million.

After taxes, the Lohses walked away with $90.9 million lump sum. Their win is the second largest in Iowa Lottery history.

But despite their new found wealth, the couple are adamant that their 
three children, aged 15, 11 and eight, will not lose sight of their 
values.

'Basically, they’re going to get a lot more dates, which was important to the 15-year-old,' Mr Lohse said.

Make the most of it: Mr and Mrs Lohse said they are considering quitting their jobs

'But don’t change the way we’ve raised you. You’re still the same person. You still have the same values.

'Obviously, things are going to change.'

Their first big spend was at a 
wedding they went to out of town in the days after learning of their 
good fortune, choosing not to tell anyone about it until they got back 
home.

$365 million was won on February 18, 2006 by a single ticket in Nebraska, shared between eight co-workers.

In a July 29, 1998 draw $295.7 million was won by 13 machinists, state unknown.

The West family of Jacksonville, Oregon won $340 million on October 19, 2005.

A jackpot worth $314.3 million was won by a retired auto worker from Ohio on August 25, 2007.

In November 2011, three male Greenwich, Connecticut financial executives won $254.2 million.

'Their wedding gift got a lot better,' Mrs Lohse joked.

Next on the list is paying off their student loans, which Mr Lohse said 'we’ve struggled with our whole lives'.

They want to buy new cars and build a new house.

And Mr Lohse has already splashed out on a new pair of designer shoes.

But they are also keen to give back to their local community.

Both Mr and Mrs Lohse said they are considering quitting their jobs, he as an attorney, she a medical technician.

Mr Lohse also serves on the City Council, described by mayor Keith Ryan as 'our voice of reason.'

'We're both on leave of absence,' Mr Lohse said. 'I've told my boss he might want to start looking for my replacement.'

Mary Lohse bought the winning ticket at Casey's General Store in Bondurant, Iowa in the days leading up to the Powerball draw on Wednesday September 26.

No more need for that! A sign seeking the lucky winners lies discarded outside the garage

The Lohses didn't go public at first, keeping quite about their epic win, prompting speculation about who it might be

The couple don't play regularly, she said, and only buy tickets on occasion when they stop off for gas.

'You'll be filling up less often if you buy a bigger car,' quipped Mr Rich good-naturedly as he presented the Lohses with their cheque.

Needless to say they won't be needing much more cash in a hurry.

'We’ve certainly been blessed beyond what we ever thought we would be,' Mr Lohse said.

Spreading their good fortune, the couple plan to establish a charitable foundation and hope to make donations to benefit their church, their childrens' school district, Bondurant-Farrar, and cancer research.
