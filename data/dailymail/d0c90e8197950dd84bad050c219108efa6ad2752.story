Qatar has issued a decree advising tourists that leggings are not considered pants and are not modest enough to wear in public.

Leggings have been singled out in pamphlets distributed by the Gulf state as inappropriate attire for tourists in the notoriously strict Islamic country.

The Reflect Your Respect campaign, launched by the Qatar Islamic Cultural Center, has listed some advice and tips for tourists on how to dress modestly in preparation for the 2022 Football World Cup it is hosting.

LEGGINGS ARE NOT PANTS: The Gulf state has issued its stance on leggings as part of its modesty drive

The pamphlets ask visitors to help preserve Qatar's culture and values. They state: 'If you are in Qatar, you are one of us. Please dress modestly in public places.'

It then adds: 'Leggings are not pants.'

The campaign uses social media to help get its message across, including the use of its own Twitter account.

There are a range of other recommendations included in the campaign that visitors need to be wary of if planning to travel to Qatar.

Public displays of intimacy and affection are strongly discouraged in Qatar

Anyone who says indecent phrases or is involved in an obscene act in public could face up to six months in prison

Women should dress modestly and men should not be shirtless in public

Public displays of affection and intimacy are strongly discouraged

Ask permission before taking a photo of someone you don't know personally

The campaign has received a mixed reaction online.

One person responded: 'If this campaign ran in the UK it would be blasted for being "racist". Why is it suddenly acceptable elsewhere, regardless of religious or cultural beliefs? Basic human rights should be accepted globally, not just where some see fit.'

The leaflets remind the visitor they are 'one of us' when visiting Qatar
