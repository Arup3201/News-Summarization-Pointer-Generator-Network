The Premier League says referees chief Mike Riley will contact Swansea manager Garry Monk this week but insist that a letter and DVD from the Welsh club only arrived at its offices earlier on Monday.

Monk was vitriolic in his criticism of Riley after the defeat at Stoke on Sunday, claiming the head of Professional Game Match Officials Ltd (PGMOL) has been 'very poor' in not responding to a list of what he felt were bad refereeing decisions he had sent him.

The Swansea manager was speaking after blasting match official Michael Oliver for a 'disgusting' decision in awarding a penalty for a foul on Stoke's Victor Moses, which he claimed was a blatant dive.

Referee's chief Mike Riley says he will contact Monk

A Premier League spokesman said the package from Swansea had not landed on Riley's desk until after the weekend.

'The correspondence from Swansea was received by PGMOL on Monday morning and Mike will no doubt be speaking to Garry this week,' the spokesman said.

Football Association disciplinary officials are understood to be studying Monk's comments about the referee to see if the Swansea manager should face any action.

Monk had said about Riley: 'I have sent a DVD off with a letter, expressing my disappointment and I've had no contact from Mike Riley.

'I think it is about being pro-active and he is clearly not doing that - he is clearly not listening to anything I am saying.

'(Riley's) job is to ring me - it's not mine to ring him. He is supposed to be the head of these guys and overseeing it all, and seeing what managers feel.

'But I've had no contact whatsoever, and for me, that is very poor.'
