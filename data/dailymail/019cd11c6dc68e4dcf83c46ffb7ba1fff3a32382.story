Whitney Cox, 27, has a six-year-old daughter and a six-month-old son and realizes that her cancer diagnosis threatens to leave her young kids without her.

But Cox, who is married from Charleston South Carolina has begun blogging that she is going to hold on for as long as she can despite being diagnosed with Stage IV cancer of an unknown origin.

'My world revolves around them. And that's all I want is to just be here for them.'
