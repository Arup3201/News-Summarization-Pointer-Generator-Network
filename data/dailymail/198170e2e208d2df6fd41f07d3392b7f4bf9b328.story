Shocking CCTV footage has emerged of a British tourist shooting himself in the head in an apparent suicide at a shooting range in Thailand. 

The horrified reaction of a worker at the range who was supervising the man - identified as Liam Colven, originally from the Isle of Skye - can be seen as he wheels away in shock after trying to stop Mr Colven turning a handgun on himself.

The footage was taken from a camera at the Thalang range on Phuket, Thailand, where the British man had arrived by taxi, reportedly following an argument with a male friend.

When he hailed the taxi, he asked the driver to 'take me somewhere I can shoot', it was reported.

A distressed staff member first tries to stop the man shooting himself, before wheeling away unable to believe what has just happened

Tragic: The man who shot himself has been identified as Liam Colven who was originally from the Isle of Skye

A Foreign Office spokesperson said it is 'urgently working with the authorities in Thailand to establish whether a British national has died in Phuket'.

The 21-year-old used an 11mm pistol to shoot himself in the head.

The incident happened at around 3pm local time when according to a staffer at the range, Mr Colven bought one package of six bullets and fired them all off at a target, reports the Phuket Gazette.

He then asked for three more bullets before turning the gun on himself and firing at point blank range, staff and witnesses told police.

Paying tribute to Mr Colven on Facebook last night, friend Alex Macleod said: 'There are no more words to sum up the events of today or to describe the loss and emotions of the people of Skye that has not all ready been said.

'However I consider myself lucky to be a part of a small community that I know will support the family in the days, weeks, & years to come.

'This wonderful community will also share in the loss and help each other to overcome it. RIP Liam Colven.'

Jenny Mackenzie wrote: 'Love you Liam Colven sleep tight will cya one day mate x.' 

In the video of the incident, the staff member, wearing a light blue shirt, flings the sun hat he is wearing aside seconds after the shooting.

Clearly in serious distress immediately following the man's actions, which apparently came without any sort of warning, he grips a table in shock before walking away with his hands on his head.

Phuketwan reports that the British man called a taxi from a rank outside the Sun Wing Resort in Bang Tao to take him to the shooting range at around 2pm. 

The taxi driver who picked him up from a hotel at the beach resort, on Phuket's west coast, said the man was seen arguing with a friend before he picked him up.

Prasert Pasaman, 41, said: 'I then asked him where he wanted to go, and he said "take me somewhere I can shoot" so I took him to the shooting range,' The Bangkok Post reported.

But Mr Pasaman later told MailOnline that Mr Colven had not been involved in an argument, and had seemed 'happy' and 'normal' before the incident.

Mr Pasaman said that he had seen Mr Colven speaking to another man outside the Sunkiss Hotel, but said they were not arguing.

'They talked for around half an hour. Not fighting just talking.'

The taxi driver was sure the man had been Mr Colven's friend and not a hotel employee, and that Mr Colven was stopping by to see him.

Despite not knowing for sure, he added: 'they looked like they knew each other'

After that Mr Colven walked the short distance across the road and asked for a taxi.

'He said, "I want to shoot" so I took him there.

The driver said there was 'some talk' during the drive but added that his 'English is not good' and the only thing he remembered was that he was 'from the UK'. 

Mr Colven was not staying in the premises himself, but it's believed he was visiting a friend before he went to the shooting range and shot himself dead. 

'He was just sitting out the front for around a half an hour or an hour,' receptionist Jasmine Belarmino told MailOnline on Sunday.

'He look fine. He didn't seem sad or worried. He asked one of the employees about taxis.

'There are so many people through the hotel everyday and he didn't stand out to me. He was like anybody else.'

A Thai policeman told MailOnline that Mr Colven had not been staying in the Ban Tao area prior to his death and that the young man's belongings had been collected by officers and taken to a the Thalang police station.

He added that Mr Colven had been at the Sunkiss hotel to 'visit a friend'.

A staffer at the Thalang shooting range said: 'He came by a taxi. He bought a ticket for shooting a .45 handgun and then then shot himself in the head.'

The British tourist shot himself after emptying one magazine at a target, staff at the Thalang range said

A young man living near the shooting range, who did not want to give his name, told MailOnline: 'It is sad. I heard shots and someone scream. 

'The police came and took his body away.'

The range the 21-year-old visited is deep in the Phuket countryside, down a number of rocky byroads and around an hour from the bustling hub of Patong.

The spot is peaceful  at night with plenty of trees around and a tied-up elephant grazing in front.

Lt Kraisorn Boonprasop of the Thalang Police said: 'We have taken statements from some witnesses but we will question more people at the scene and we have yet to review the CCTV footage.'

Southeast Asia has an unfortunate reputation as somewhere where dangerous weapons can be fired for fun if you know the right people. 

There are also dozens of legitimate shooting ranges across the country offering tourists a wide array of guns to shoot.

It may be  illegal for a foreigner to own or purchase firearms in Thailand, but you can fire handguns, rifles, shotguns and automatic weapons at these establishments.

In Patong, around an hour from Thalang, the Shooting Café is located in the Jungceylon shopping mall and boasts on its website that it has an 'air-conditioned, full-service café wrapped around the shooting range.

'There’s a closed-circuit TV system inside too, so you can sit at the bar with a drink and watch shooters firing on all cylinders.' 

The Old City, known as Rattanakosin, is the epicentre of gun culture in the capital Bangkok.

According to thailawforum: 'almost 80 gun and weapons shops line Wang Burapha Road. 

'Shotguns and rifles stand upright in retail window displays next to arrays of handguns and ammo.

'For Thais looking to purchase guns, there’s no other place to go, though for foreign gun-enthusiasts, the most you can do is look.'

If you're an expat resident or seasoned traveller in the region the chances are you know at least one person who has 'rented' weapons from enterprising military personnel.
