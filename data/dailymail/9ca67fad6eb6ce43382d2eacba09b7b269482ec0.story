Britain's oldest cave art has been found – on a rock deep underground in Wales.

The faint scratchings of a reindeer with a spear in its neck date back 14,000 years. The cave art, nicknamed Rudolph by  archaeologists, was carved by a hunter-gatherer in the Ice Age.

Experts are studying the discovery at a secret location on the Gower Peninsula, near Swansea.

Found in Wales: The faint scratchings of a reindeer with a spear in its neck date back 14,000 years - Britain's oldest cave art

It was discovered by ‘pure chance’ by archaeologist Dr George Nash, who has been visiting the cave complex for more than 20 years.

He said: ‘It was a strange moment of being in the right place at the right time with the right kit.

‘I’ve been taking students there for 20-odd years talking about what was going on there.

‘On this particular day they all went back to the bus but I decided to stay behind and have a snoop around in the cave.

‘Within a couple of minutes I was scrubbing at the back of a very strange and awkward recess.

‘Then a very faint image bounced in front of me – I couldn’t believe my eyes.

‘It was a once-in-a life time experience – lots of archaeologists get to study rock art but very few find any.’

Experts are also studying other marks etched into the rock below the speared reindeer.

Dr Nash, associate professor at the University of Tomar in Portugal, said of the artwork: ‘This drawing was done with the right hand by somebody using a piece of flint who has drawn a classic reindeer design.

‘It is very, very exciting.’

Archaelologists have previously dated drawings of red deer at Creswell Crags on the border of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire to around 12,000 to 14,000BC.

Dr Nash added: 'I think this newly found carving may be roughly the same period or may be even earlier.

'We know from the glacial geology of the area this was an open area just before the ice limit came down from the glaciers 15,000 to 20,000 years ago and it stops just about 2km short of the cave site.

'We know hunter fisher gatherers were roaming around this landscape.'

The cave painting is being verified by experts at the National Museum of Wales and Cadw, the Welsh Ancient Monuments group.

Its location will be revealed to the public in the near future.
