A father has been charged for the murder of his two-year-old son after he admitted suffocating the child so he could leave the house and go back to playing online games at an internet cafe.

Police arrested the unemployed 22-year-old, in the city of Taegu, South Korea, on Sunday after finding the body of his child in a suitcase wrapped in a trash bag near his home.

The man, identified only by his surname Chung, had earlier reported the boy missing.

An unemployed father has been charged with the murder of his two-year-old son. South Korean television aired closed circuit TV footage of Chung that showed him getting into an elevator with a suitcase and checking his hair in the mirror, apparently on his way to dispose of his son's body

Officers initially believed he had left his son to starve to death by abandoning him for 10 days while playing games.

But Chung later confessed to 'covering the child's nose and mouth with his hand,' more than a month ago, killing him so that he could go to an internet cafe, a police officer said.

The whereabouts of the infant's mother was not clear, although local news reports said she had been away from the house for some time working in a factory.

The man, identified only by his surname Chung, has reportedly admitted suffocating the child so he could leave the house and go back to playing online games at an internet cafe

Online game addiction is seen as a 
serious social issue in South Korea which has near-universal 
availability of high-speed internet.

The government has tried to limit minors from going online to play late in the evening by cutting their connections.

In 2012 a woman in South Korea was arrested after giving birth in the toilet of an internet cafe and abandoning the newborn, The Times has reported.

The woman had reportedly been playing for days in the internet cafe.
