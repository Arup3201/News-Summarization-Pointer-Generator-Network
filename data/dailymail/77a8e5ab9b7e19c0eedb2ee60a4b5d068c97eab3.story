A soldier who returned home for the holidays to spend time with his wife and newborn baby has been told that he will have to stay elsewhere after the landlord said that he would be breaking the terms of his wife's lease.

Sergeant William Bolt is stationed in Missouri, but his wife lives in Central, South Carolina with their newborn baby girl.

However, the landlord of the apartment is forcing Sergeant Bolt to leave his wife's home because he would be overstaying the time allowed for visitors.

Welcome home, now get out! Sergeant William Bolt who has returned home for the holidays to see his wife, Lily, and newborn baby in South Carolina is being kicked out of his wife’s apartment after the landlord said he cannot stay for more than a week

Difficult choice: Sergeant William Bolt is stationed in Missouri, but his wife, Lily,  has been in Central. She gave birth to their daughter two weeks ago

Rules are rules: The landlord at The Groves apartment complex in Central told him he had overstayed, saying visitors are not allowed to stay in the apartments past seven days, per the agreement signed by Bolt’s wife

An agreement signed by his wife Lily, stated that guests can only stay in the residence for up to a week - but no longer. 

'I'm stationed in Missouri and we haven't seen each other in six months. What's the problem with me staying and visiting with my wife?' Sergeant Bolt said.

The landlord, whose name is Chuck, told FOX Carolina he enforces the same rule for all his tenants.

The problem occurs because Sergeant Bolt's name is not on the lease that his wife signed.

The fact he is a visiting spouse makes absolutely no difference and the landlord has made it very clear that there will be consequences if she disobeys.

Common sense: Lawyers say the landlord would have a hard time pressing charges, since the person visiting is the tenant’s husband

Sleep outside! SinceSeargent Bolt’s name is not on the lease, even though he is a spouse visiting, the landlord said he is not allowed to stay

The landlord has said that he has the power to press charges and even double his wife's rent if he stays in the apartment.   

'He stated to me that he didn't care about our situation, he didn't care about me being in the military,' Sergeant Bolt said.

Legal experts believe the landlord would have a hard time evicting Mrs Bolt, especially since it is her husband who would be staying and not some other guest that she could be earning something from.
