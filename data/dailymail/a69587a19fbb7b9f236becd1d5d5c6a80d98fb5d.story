Police are hunting this speeding motorist who at first glance seems only to be concerned about the young girl he just ran over, but in reality he was simply threatening the traumatised teenager to not tell anyone.

CCTV footage of the incident shows Zara Zaytseva, 13, waiting at traffic lights and beginning to cross when they switch from green to amber. She had been on her way home after visiting friends in the city of Ufa in the central Russian Republic of Bashkortostan.

But seconds later she was hit by the speeding motorist and sent flying across the snow-covered road.

As the car screeches to a halt the stunned teen picks herself up and staggers back to the pavement as the driver rushes over and seemingly concerned, helps her to the other side of the road.

But in reality he had grabbed her, told her it was all her fault and warned not to tell anyone, otherwise she could end up in trouble with police.

He is then seen getting back into his car and driving off, leaving her to walk the rest of the way home.

The girl's furious mother Guzel, 45, said: 'When Zara got home she was quite badly shaken but luckily not seriously hurt.

'The very least the man could have done was phone an ambulance. He certainly should have called the police.

The girl is left dazed on the side of the road and the car that struck her stops a few yards away

The driver is actually threatening the Zaytseva and telling her not to go to the police

'But instead he just had the audacity to tell her to be quiet and not mention anything about what he did as if it was her fault.'

'It's just as well she did. I immediately contacted the police and they were able to secure CCTV footage.'

A police spokesman said: 'We have seen the footage and are trying to find witnesses and leads to  identify the driver.'
