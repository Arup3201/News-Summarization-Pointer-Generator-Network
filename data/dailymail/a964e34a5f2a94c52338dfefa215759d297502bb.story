Nile Ranger was reportedly questioned by police after an argument with girlfriend on the motorway

Ex-Newcastle United player Nile Ranger has been questioned by police after he had a row on the middle of the motorway, it has been reported.

The former Premier League footballer is said to have been driving along the M55 near Preston on Friday night when he got into an argument with his girlfriend - who was in a separate car. 

It is believed police were called to the busy carriageway in Lancashire to speak with the couple, who had been shouting at each other with their windows down.

A witness, who nearly crashed into them, told the Sunday People that Ranger, 23, was in his Mercedes in the middle lane and his girlfriend was in the first lane in an Audi.  

They claim they had stopped to argue for a couple of minutes before the cars started moving - only to stop minutes later where the dispute resumed.

'We nearly crashed into them and a taxi nearly went into them too,' the motorist said. 

'At first we thought it was one of those bash-for-cash insurance scams. We thought they were trying to get people to crash into the back of them.

'We were shouting out of the window for them to get into the hard shoulder. That's when we rang the police.'

Ranger, who now plays for Championship club Blackpool, and his girlfriend eventually pulled over where he told the witness they had split up and were arguing over her giving back his keys.

The onlooker, who did not even recognise the footballer, told the paper the incident lasted about 20 minutes and she was going to London but had not given his key back.

The controversial player, who was fired by Swindon Town FC earlier this year after he was caught on CCTV punching a woman, took to Twitter today.

The footballer is believed to have been driving along the M55 near Preston when the row erupted on Friday

He tweeted: 'Media are bloody desperate lol...itching to mess me up...lol #desperado,' which was followed by a second post: 'Lol... Next thing I know I'm gonna spill some milk for my cornflakes. And be in the media for that.. 'NILE SPILLS MILK FOR HIS CORNFLAKES'.

The player, who was once paid £5,000-a-week to play for Newcastle United, was arrested on suspicion of rape last year but was cleared of the charges in March. 

Ranger represented England at under-19 level on 11 occasions, scoring six goals

A formidable talent on the pitch has given Nile Ranger opportunities most youngsters can only dream of.

But the striker, who represented England at under-19 level, has had his promising future hampered by a string of brushes with the law.

Ranger previously has spoken of how he got embroiled in gang culture while growing up in London.

He served an 11-week sentence in a young offenders' institution when he was 15 after he took part in an armed robbery.

But despite saying 'I never want to go back', the striker found himself again facing charges in 2011, after a 33-year-old man was found outside a Newcastle pub with a broken jaw.

In October 2012 he was finally cleared of two counts of actual bodily harm relating to the incident, after a court heard his actions were in self defence and he had been the victim of racist taunts.

But he was also handed a 12-month conditional discharge after admitting assaulting two police officers who were trying to arrest him in connection with the fight.

Before that case was even resolved, Ranger was given a six-month conditional discharge after admitting a charge of being drunk and disorderly, and sentenced to 120 hours community service after admitting pulling his then-girlfriend's hair during a row.

In the meantime, he was also rapped by the FA and his then club, Newcastle United, for posing with a replica gun in a photograph that was subsequently published in The Sun and making homophobic remarks on Twitter. 

In January last year, Ranger was arrested on suspicion of rape. He was cleared of any wrongdoing in March this year. 

He refused to apologise to a woman after writing off her parked car while swerving to avoid a fox in May 2013.

Ranger found himself in more car-related trouble this year when he was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay compensation to the driver of a taxi he broke the window of.

He was again fined for criminal damage in July after repeatedly kicking a jammed door at his penthouse suite in Swindon, where he played in the 2013-14 season. 

CCTV showed him damaging 'a lift door, wall and glass panel', and also appeared to show him hitting his girlfriend in the face three times.

In May, Ranger was cleared of being drunk in charge of his sports car after he was found asleep behind the wheel on the M4 in Wales.
