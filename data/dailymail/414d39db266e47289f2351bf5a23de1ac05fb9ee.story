A teacher at a suburban Texas middle school faces felony charges for allegedly having a sexual relationship with one of her 15-year-old male students that dates back to at least November of 2013.

In at least one case, Hopper Middle School math teacher Corrie Anne Long, 43, performed oral sex on the boy in her classroom.

Authorities first started investigating Long after a fellow student told school staff that he saw Long and the 15-year-old alleged victim engaged in bizarre horseplay - namely, the witness said he saw the 15-year-old student spanking Long.

In another instance, the student told school staff that he saw Long sitting in the 15-year-old's lap, according to court records first obtained by Chron.com.

School staff reported the incident to authorities, who interviewed the 15-year-old alleged victim.

During interviews with investigators, the 15-year-old said he had known long since he was in sixth grade and she currently was his math teacher. He also told authorities that Long performed oral sex on him in November of 2013 while the two were alone in her classroom just before the Thanksgiving break.

The school - located in a suburb of Houston - released a statement about the charges against Long, saying that she has been removed from her position with the school as soon as the allegations against her were made.

According to the statement, Long is now on administrative leave and not permitted on the campus as authorities continue to investigate.

'The safety of our students is always our highest priority. The district
 took immediate action to remove the teacher once the allegations were 
made, and we will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement in 
this matter,' the district's statement said.

Long, who has been with the district since 2002, has been charged with sexual assault of a child under the age of 17 and having an improper relationship with a minor.

She currently is free on $30,000 bond.
