Alec Baldwin is again the target a criticism from gay rights groups after he was caught on camera calling a photographer a 'c***sucker' - and possibly worse.

TMZ.com claims Baldwin called a photographer a 'c***sucking f**' as he was leaving his New York City apartment Thursday following the sentencing of his stalker, Genevieve Sabourin.

The '30 Rock' star claims he never used the word 'f**' - and pleaded ignorance when he was publicly taken to task for using the term 'c***sucker.'

Angry: Alec Baldwin chased after a photographer after he got too close to his wife Hilaria and newborn daughter Thursday afternoon

Called out: GLAAD publicly chastised Baldwin shortly after the incident for his homophobic language - the second time the group has intervened with him this year

Pleading ignorance: Baldwin offered up an apology in the days after the altercation and this excuse after GLAAD criticized his use of language- which he Tweeted but deleted shortly after

Shortly after Baldwin's homophobic tirade was published, gay rights group GLAAD public chastised the 55-year-old actor.

'Mr. Baldwin can’t lend his support for equality on paper, while degrading gay people in practice,' the group tweeted.

'It's clearly time Mr. Baldwin listens to the calls from so many LGBT people and allies to end this pattern of anti-gay slurs.'

At first Baldwin tweeted: 'If c'sucker offends, then I apologize. Anti-gay? Never.'

He later delete that message and offered up a mea culpa - of sorts.

'1-Rich Ferraro from @glaad informs me that c'sucker is an anti-gay epithet. In which case I apologize and will retire it from my vocabulary,' he tweeted.

'2- you learn something new every day.'

Baldwin took to Twitter to defend himself from the TMZ report the he used a homophobic slur

Apology: Baldwin did say he was sorry for using the term 'c***sucker' - but claimed he was being smeared by TMZ and conservatives

Baldwin - who was recently tapped to host his own show on MSNBC - has become known as a champion of liberal causes, but this is not the first time he has been accused of using homophobic epithets.

New York magazine
 details four incidents in which he used homophobic slurs.

In 1997, he allegedly called a horse carriage driver a 'f*****' for supporting carriage rides outside Central Park. In 2011, he was accused of calling a Starbucks barista and 'uptight queen.'

In 2012, he called the New York Daily News editor an 'English queen.'

Finally, in June, he tweeted out a homophobic rant directed at a MailOnline reporter, calling him a 'toxic queen' and said he would 'stick his foot in the reporter's a**,' except that the reporter would 'dig it too much.'

For that remark, GLAAD chastised Baldwin - but let him off when he wrote the group a formal apology and promised to mend his ways.

He also vowed to stay off Twitter. That didn't seem to stick, either.

Conferring: Genevieve Sabourin is asked by her attorney Todd Spodek whether she would like to make a statement to the court before she was found guilty on all counts of harassing and stalking Alec Baldwin today

Disdain: Genevieve Sabourin refused to say more than two sentences to the court before the judge informed her that she was to spend the next seven months in prison for stalking Alec Baldwin and his family

Baldwin fired off a series of Tweets after TMZ published its accusations.

He denied that he used to word 'f**,' as TMZ had insinuated.

'Acoustic analysis proves the word is 
fathead. Fathead,' he wrote. 'Anti-gay slurs are wrong. They not only 
offend, but threaten hard fought tolerance of LGBT rights.'

He also said TMZ was trying to 'bury' him and he threatened to sue. He also said conservatives were using the incident to criticize him.

Those tweets have all since been deleted.

Baldwin becomes irate when a photographer gets too close to his wife Hilaria and newborn daughter.

'Get away from my wife and baby with that camera,' he snaps.

A woman, likely Hilaria, can be heard calling to him to back off as he chases the photographer down the block.

Earlier in the day, Baldwin's 
convicted stalker, Sabourin, was sentenced to seven months at Riker's 
Island after she was convicted of stalking and harassing Baldwin and his
 new wife in 2012.

She 
repeatedly shouted that Baldwin was lying as he testified against her 
and was given 30 days in jail for contempt of course. The judge 
sentenced her to six additional months for the stalking charges - twice 
what prosecutors has recommended.
