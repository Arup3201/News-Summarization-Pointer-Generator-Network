The Reddit user said his boss loved his work - describing the prank as 'awesome'

A man working at a doughnut shop has kept himself amused on the job by printing a hilarious tribute to late comedian on a receipt which he handed to a customer.

The 'Freshest Donuts' employee, who goes by buckwheatwaffle on Reddit, posted the note which features a snippet of Hedberg's 'doughtnut bit'.

The stand-up comedian, who died in 2005 of an apparent drug overdose, poked fun at the concept of providing receipts for trivial everyday transactions - like buying a doughnut, for instance.

So naturally, buckwheatwaffle paid homage to Hedberg with an excellent touch of irony.

'I bought a donut (Sic) and they gave me a reciept for the donut,' the note, quoting Hedberg, reads.

'I don't need a receipt for the donut. I give you money and you give me the doughnut, end of transaction.'

'Buckwheatwaffle' says his boss found out about the cheeky prank - and loved it.

'My boss actually found it hilarious,' he wrote.

'Which is why my job is awesome.'

'I bought a doughnut and they gave me a receipt for the doughnut.

I don't need a receipt for the doughnut.

I'll just give you the money - you give me the doughnut.

End of transaction!

We don't need to bring ink and paper into this.

I just could not imagine a scenario where I would have to prove that I bought a doughnut.

Some sceptical friend... don't even act like I didn't get that doughnut. I got the documentation right here!

Oh wait it's back home in the file. Under D - for Doughnut.'
