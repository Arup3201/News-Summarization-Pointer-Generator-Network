It has become the latest must-have app, and raised over $1m in funding - despite being described as pointless.

However, Yo - which lets you send just that word to friends - has been hacked, with students claiming they can extract the phone number of any user.

The app's makers admit the flaw is real - and say they are 'still working' on fixing it.

An app called Yo (logo pictured) is currently taking the internet by storm. Since launching in April it has amassed 50,000 users and has apparently been given $1 million in funding. The app is available to download for free on both iOS and Android and lets users send the word yo to others - and nothing else

 The 'Yo' app can be downloaded from the iTunes store or Google Play for free.

When the app is loaded up users are asked to pick a username.

Friends can then be invited to the app by text, Facebook or Twitter.

When a friend's username is added, tapping on it will send them a yo.

They will then receive a notification saying they have received a yo - and that's it.

An additional feature involves adding the user 'WORLDCUP', which will then send you a yo every time a goal is scored in the 2014 Brazil World Cup.

But you won't know who scored without checking up elsewhere.

Other functionality is promised for the app in the future.

TechCrunch said it was contacted by three college students who said they had uncovered a flaw in the app.

'We can get any Yo user's phone number (I actually texted the founder, and he called me back),' the students said.

'We can spoof yos from any users, and we can spam any user... We could also send any Yo user a push notification with any text we want (though we decided not to do that).'

Other developers have been able to recreate the flaw.

Others have claimed there are other problems - one even managing to send Yos pretending to be SpaceX and Tesla boss Elon Musk.

In just over two months it has gained £590,000 ($1 million) in funding and now has a growing userbase of about 50,000.

According to the Financial Times the app took just eight hours to build but is quickly proving a hit with its ‘single-tap zero character communication tool.’

Or Arbel, the app's creator. told TechCrunch he was dealing with the issue, but would not elaborate further.'Some of the stuff has been fixed and some we are still working on,' he said, adding that he had hired a specialist security team.

'We are taking this very seriously.'

Similar problems have hit apps such as Snapchat and Tinder in the past few months.

The firm boasts that it takes 11 taps to send the word ‘yo’ on a rival messaging service like WhatsApp compared to just two on their app.

When the app is first installed you will be asked to pick a username. You can then add the names of friends to send them a yo (left). When a yo is sent the recipient will receive a notification that they have received it (right), and nothing else. The company says it is a ‘single-tap zero character communication tool'

Some of the tongue-in-cheek reviews on the iTunes store were quick to eschew the apparent qualities of the app.

‘Since downloading Yo, all my relationships have improved and I've regrown most of my hair,’ said one reviewer.

‘Receiving a yo is fast becoming the highlight of my day,’ added another on the Google Play store.

‘So much mystery! Why is this person yo-ing me? Should I respond?’

The initial $1 million for the app was supplied by investors associated with Moshe Hogeg, a CEO involved in a social network called Mobli.

Whether the app continues to wide its wave of success remains to be seen.
