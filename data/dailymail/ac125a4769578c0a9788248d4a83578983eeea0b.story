A boy genius who finished college at 11 is about to graduate with a degree in maths at just 14 years old.

And Moshe Kai Cavalin now faces a dilemma that troubles very few young teenagers.

The Los Angeles-based student is trying to decide whether to study astrophysics or physics for his second university degree.

Precocious child: Moshe Kai Cavalin, pictured with his mother Suichen Chein, began reading college-level books aged two

Moshe's mother Suichen Chein said she realised 
her son’s incredible abilities when he started reading 
college-level books at age two.

After completing his studies at East LA Community College aged 11, Moshe took up maths at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles).

The family say his fellow students - who are nearly a decade older than Moshe - have been supportive of the 14-year-old.

'At first they were really curious, what
am I doing there?' Moshe told ABCNews.com. '[Then] they started being 
like big brothers and big sisters.'

He said he now prefers to spend time with his classmates rather
than children of his own age.

Remarkable intellect: Moshe is also a published author, having written a book about his experiences called 'We Can Do'

'We talk about [life] and studies and all the 
material in class,' he said.

But in spite of his early 
accomplishments, the precocious teenager says he does not want to be defined purely by 
his intellect. 

'Genius is just a word just like IQ is a number,' he said. 'It just classifies [them] at one point and 
ignores everything else that makes the individual who they are.'

His mother, who chaperones the youngster to class, said: 'He’s a happy kid and he’s learning so well. He’s doing a fantastic job by himself.'

Moshe’s father Joseph said that he realised his son’s potential one afternoon as he picked him up from school.

Early development: The young teenager says he now prefers spending time with his friends on campus than with children his own age

'I saw him outside, he was tutoring the mother of another kid,'  said Mr Cavalin. 'It was fantastic, I almost cried that day.'

Mr Cavalin decided his son needed to be put in advanced classes after his teachers said Moshe’s academic needs would disturb the other children.

Moshe was enrolled at East LA Community College aged eight - but he insists he was not forced into advanced classes too young.

'Most people say that my parents pushed me,' he said. 'However, I think happiness in childhood is more importantly passed on [through] loving parents and a creative environment.'

As Moshe prepares for his second degree, he plans to spend his summer having fun scuba diving and learning to drive.

Unfortunately, despite his exceptional talents, he will still have to wait until he is 16 to get his licence.
