A classic car once owned by former Prime Minister Harold Wilson is on the market for £25,000.

The 1967 Vanden Plas Princess R, which boasts luxurious leather seats and a foldaway picnic table, was used by Mr Wilson in the early 1970s.

It is now being sold by  James Szkiler at his dealership in Malton, North Yorkshire. He hopes to attract classic car enthusiasts looking to add to their private collections.

Previous owner: Former Prime Minister Harold Wilson (right) with his father, James Herbert Wilson, in front of the classic car. Its gearbox was modified to allow Mr Wilson to make a quick getaway in an emergency

Mint condition: Despite being built in the late 1960s, the car has only logged 8,000 miles. The log book, pictured, shows the British-made motor was bought by the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works in October 1967

The British-made motor was bought by the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works in October 1967.

It was then used by Mr Wilson and kept by the Government until 1978. It is thought the car might also have been used by Prime Ministers Edward Heath and James Callaghan. 

Despite its age, the car, which is equipped with a six-cylinder Rolls Royce engine, is in mint condition and has just 8,000 miles on the clock. 

Its gear box also offers a quick-launch function - a feature that was added to allow the prime minister to make a quick getaway in an emergency.

Customised: The four-litre vehicle was also fitted with other refinements such as folding rear picnic tables, rear safety belts, power assisted steering, a radio and wing mirrors - all costly extras in the 1960s

Produced: Made by Austin between 1964 and 1968

Cost: It would have set you back roughly £1,994 if bought new in 1964 (approximately £36,500 in today's money)

Engine: 3909cc, six-cylinder Rolls Royce engine capable of 175 horse power

Top speed: 112mph

Fuel consumption: 19 miles per gallon

Features: Power steering, leather seats, picnic table and radio - all costly extras in the 1960s

Fit for a PM: Gear box was fitted with a quick-launch function, allowing Mr Wilson to make a speedy getaway

The four-litre vehicle was also fitted with other refinements such as folding rear picnic tables, rear safety belts, power assisted steering, a radio and wing mirrors.

While we may not have picnic tables today, the other options are standard fittings - but back in the late 1960s would all have been costly extras.

The vehicle is now being sold by Mr Szkiler's company, Classic and Sportscar Centre. 

When the Vanden Plas appeared for sale, its prestigious history and Huddersfield link - Mr Wilson was from the town - made it an attractive purchase.

'When I saw it advertised I jumped on it,' he said. 'We've had a few Princesses in the past but the Harold Wilson connection struck a chord.

'There's only 8,000 miles on the clock and it's only been used for the first few years.

'It was in a stunning condition when I picked it up. It's a real collector's car for any real enthusiast who wants to enter it in competitions or someone who wants it for their own private collection.

'It's superb to drive - it's powerful, smooth and comfortable. I just hope it stays in the UK.'
