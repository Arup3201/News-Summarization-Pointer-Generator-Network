The man abducted by murdered student Jamie Gao in January has revealed for the first time his terrifying ordeal after being kidnapped, taken to a park and bashed in the head and chest.

Gao had been called in as an enforcer to 'get revenge' on 18-year-old Alex Li on behalf of a female friend, who had been dumped by the victim's flatmate, the intended target of the assault.

But when Gao, who was accompanied two teenage associates, arrived at the flat at Carlton in Sydney's south on January 9, Mr Li was not at home – so he abducted Jaiwei Yu, 19, instead.

'It was because Alex and [his girlfriend' broke up,' Mr Yu told MailOnline at his home in Sydney's southern suburbs.

'[She] wanted revenge on Alex. She used Jamie to do it ... to come around and kidnap me.'

Mr Gao, 20, was killed on Tuesday May 20 and former detectives Glen McNamara and Roger Rogerson are charged with his murder.

The University of Technology, Sydney business student's body was found floating off Sydney's Shelly Beach, near Cronulla, wrapped in a blue tarp on Monday morning.

Friends of the murdered 20-year-old say 'his intention was not to be bad' and he was swayed by peer pressure

Detained after dark: It was to this park, Tindale Reserve, in southern Sydney where Jamie Gao and two teenage accomplices took 19-year-old Jiawei Yu after kidnapping and beating him and driving him around in his car on the night of Thursday January 9 as part of a revenge attempt gone wrong

The discovery triggered a nation-wide manhunt for Rogerson, which ended in his arrest in a blaze of publicity at his Sydney home.

McNamara, a former police colleague of Rogerson's, was charged with Mr Gao's murder on Sunday night. Police allege that on the day of his murder Mr Gao got inside a car with McNamara and Rogerson while carrying what they say was $3million worth of methamphetamine.

The car was driven to a storage unit nearby, where police will allege Mr Gao was killed for the bag's contents just before 2.30pm. CCTV footage showed Mr Gao last getting out of his car holding a large bag in Padstow.

Shocked police officers have said they can't understand why they would commit such a crime in a place covered with CCTV cameras. 'It was so dumb,' a detective told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Five months earlier, the night Mr Gao abducted Mr Yu, the 19-year-old victim endured a terrifying 90-minute ordeal where he was driven around nearby suburbs, taken to Tindale Reserve, a local park, and bashed around the head and chest by Mr Gao, who he had never previously met.

'They drove around, through the park and they beat him up with fists in the head,' Mr Li told MailOnline.

Meanwhile Mr Li, the intended target, was staying at a house just one street away when Mr Gao arrived sometime after 10pm.

'They think I am with Jaiwei. We are friends,' Mr Li said today.

'They thought I would be at his house. I'm not at home and they thought he might be here.'

When Mr Gao and his two friends arrived at the apartment they lured Mr Yu, who came to Australia from Guandong Province, China five years ago, onto the street before forcing him into the car and taking off.

Mr Yu, who said he was not a student and did not currently have a job, refused to say whether Mr Gao was armed.

Police interviewed Mr Yu at his home in February and on March 22 charged Mr Gao with taking and detaining Mr Yu in company with intent to get advantage and occasioning actual bodily harm.

Gao was also charged with conspiring with the two teenagers to assault Alex Li and cause him actual bodily harm.

The girl and the third friend, who were minors at the time, will face Sutherland Children's Court on July 1 on charges relating to the kidnap and assault.

Meanwhile, a 19-year-old friend of Mr Gao's, who had lunch with him the day before he was murdered, told MailOnline his involvement in a drug deal seemed completely out of character, describing him as a 'nice guy' who was swayed by peer pressure.

'People say he's dealing drugs and he's bad. But his intention is not to be bad,' she said.

'He doesn't do anything on purpose to hurt anyone, I think he was just persuaded by his friends and by peer pressure.'

Mr Gao's friend said she was shocked the student - who had an active social life, a happy family life in a $1.5-million Hurstville home and was enjoying a budding romance with his new girlfriend - was allegedly involved in drug dealing.

'He doesn't tell us about all the stuff he does,' she said.

'He does tell us about his private life, family and girlfriend but not about the illegal stuff.'

Mr Gao's girlfriend told the MailOnline it was a 'very hard time' for her

The day before his murder was reportedly as normal for Mr Gao as any other. He went to his morning university classes before stopping for lunch at a nearby cafe with a uni friend.

At no stage, his friend told MailOnline, did he seem nervous or on edge. Nor did he mention his plans for the following day. Instead he spent his time gushing about his new girlfriend - a young woman he'd had a crush on for some time and had been dating for just 'a couple of months'.

Pictures posted to Mr Gao's girlfriend's Facebook page show the couple hugging and kissing.

Mr Gao's girlfriend told MailOnline she was struggling to cope with the news. She declined to comment in detail, saying it was a 'very hard time' for her.

On Monday May 19, the UTS business student went to class in the morning and afternoon as normal. During a break between 11am and 1pm he lunched with a friend at Caffe Tiamo on Pitt St in Sydney's CBD.

His female friend, who did not want to be named, said Mr Gao did not talk about his plans for the next day.

'He was fine, normal. we had lunch,' she said. 'He didn't tell me about the meeting.'

Mr Gao's friend told MailOnline that, before the body was formally identified, his girlfriend was still hopeful he'd return, saying she 'still expects him to come back'.

'They've only officially been together a couple of months, but he liked her for a while,' she said.

Mr Gao lived with his mother Catherin Sui Ying Gao and grandmother in a $1.5 million house in Hurstville. A woman at the home on Monday declined to comment.

The friend described Mr Gao as social and naturally smart.

'He wasn't crazy about study, he wasn't the nerdy type that studies every day, he was more social,' she said.

A body found floating off Shelly Beach near Cronulla was formally identified as Mr Gao on Tuesday afternoon
