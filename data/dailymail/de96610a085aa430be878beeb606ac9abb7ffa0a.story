The man that uploaded the video, who chose to remain anonymous, told Herald Sun he was angered by what he witnessed.

'The reason why it bothers me is that I send stuff all the time internationally and domestically and the stuff ends up in damaged boxes.

'Now I know why, so this is my little protest.' 

A spokesperson for DHL confirmed the clip was legitimate.

'DHL is obviously shocked to see the handling of the shipments in such a way,' she said.

'It's contrary to all of our policies and has spurred us to really prompt action.'

Similar videos have surfaced in the past, prompting the creation of community pages such as 'Don't Throw My Package', which expose couriers  mishandling packages.

The site lists on it's Facebook page it was 'born in an effort to showcase, reveal and rectify the modern-day mishandling of human-delivered packages.'
