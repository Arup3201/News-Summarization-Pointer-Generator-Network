Although humans come in all shapes and size, the lifeless plastic dolls used to advertise the clothes we wear rarely do.

So when a photograph of a fuller-figured mannequin emerged on Facebook earlier this week, the internet gave a standing ovation.

The photograph, taken at a Swedish department store, shows a 'larger-than-average' clothing doll wearing a purple lingerie set, next to one of ‘normal-size’.

'Real-life sized': The photo of the Swedish mannequin was posted on Facebook earlier this week and has been shared more than 17,200 times

The photo was posted on Facebook page Women’s Rights News earlier this week with the caption: ‘Store mannequins in Sweden. They look like real women. The US should invest in some of these’

Since Tuesday the photo of the Swedish mannequin has received more than 56,000 likes.

It has been shared over 17,200 times and nearly 3,000 people have left comments, a majority of which are raving about the Scandinavian retailer’s choice to use a mannequin the size of a ‘real woman’.

The original poster, 29-year-old Rebecka from Malmo, found the dummy in department store Åhléns in 2010 and wrote about her discovery on her blog.

The norm: Mannequins in the petite shape we are used to, at the launch of Versace's collection for H&M

‘The mannequin to the right actually 
reminds you of the size of a real human being. So nice! She is still 
skinny, but it looks healthy.’

She also points a finger at Swedish retail success H&M, calling their mannequins ‘insanely skinny’ adding that the High Street giant’s dolls has ‘a waist like my shin’.

H&M is not the only retailer to be critiqued for their skinny mannequins. In 2011 Gap launched their ‘always skinny’ campaign to promote a new jeans cut, accompanied by dummies with stick-thin legs.

The campaign was followed by a huge online backlash where the high street brand was accused of promoting anorexia.
