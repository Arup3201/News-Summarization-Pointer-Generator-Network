A Tennessee couple has been arrested for renting out their four daughters, aged 5 to 16, to appear in black market child porn.

Connie, 40, and Ronnie Lee McCall, 61, were keeping their daughters in a deplorably dirty Johnson City trailer, authorities say, before it emerged they were selling them for sex.

The prosecuting attorney called the case, in which the parents are believed to have been strung out on bath salts, one of the worst he’s seen in his 20-year career.

The sickening saga began in the summer of 2012, when the girls aged 5, 12, 15, 17, were removed from the home after calls to protective services.

District Attorney Tony Clark told WCYB that Johnson City Police first discovered the despicable conditions.

‘When the youngest child was taken in, several if not all of her teeth were rotted. There was animal waste inside the home,’ he said.

The youngest also reportedly had flea bites, head and body lice, and ring worm.

Plea: Authorities say the children were being taken to addresses in Tennessee and South Carolina, where they were filmed performing sex acts. Ronnie Lee McCall pleaded not guilty on Friday

‘The amount of tooth decay, you can imagine, was extremely painful. She had black teeth, and holes in all the teeth, just really inexcusable,’ said Debbie Dunn with the city’s police department.

After questioning the girls, investigators realized the girls were being subjected to more than just parental neglect.

'There was money that changed hands between the individuals that were taking pictures and the parents,’ Clark revealed. ‘The children said that they had been taken to various locations and performing sex acts with an adult.’

What’s more, the sex acts were reportedly filmed for black market child pornography.

'The children were at my house constantly,' said their former neighbor Marsha Pierce, who was nonetheless shocked when she learned the charges against the McCalls

When it was then discovered that the McCalls were taking their young daughters to not only a Tennessee address but also across state lines to South Carolina, the case was handed to the FBI.

‘When you have parents allegedly making money off their kids through pornography and exploitation, even after 20 years, it's one of the worst cases I've ever seen,’ Clark told WATE.

Clark also said that the Washington County man believed to have had sexual contact with and who filmed the girls has since committed suicide.

The girls are now living in foster care and in good condition. Officials hope they can be adopted as a group so that they may stay as a family.

Ronnie Lee McCall has already pleaded not guilty to the charges. Connie McCall is due back in court to make her plea on Wednesday.
