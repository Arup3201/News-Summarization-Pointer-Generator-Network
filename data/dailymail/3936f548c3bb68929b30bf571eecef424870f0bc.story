A foreign doctor who failed to tell his NHS and police employers about his conviction for the 'mercy killing' manslaughter of a patient in Spain acted dishonestly, medical watchdogs found today.

Dr Marcos Arel Hourmann worked for Dyfed Powys Police for more than two years despite being under investigation and subsequently convicted of manslaughter in Spain, the General Medical Council (GMC) has heard.

He injected a cancer-riddled patient already at death’s door to 'rid her of the unbearable suffering' and end her life while working at a hospital in Spain in 2005, the GMC was told.

Within a year, Dr Hourmann, 52, had come to the UK and started to work for the West Suffolk NHS Trust before getting another job with Carmarthenshire NHS Trust and going to work for the police as a forensic medical examiner.

But he failed to tell any of his new employers about the continuing police investigation in Spain or the subsequent court case.

Today, a fitness to practise panel of the GMC, sitting in Manchester, found that Dr Hourmann, who is not represented or present at the hearing in Manchester, acted dishonestly.

The panel will now have to consider whether his actions amount to misconduct and, if so, whether the doctor should face punishment, such as being struck off.

The panel is not expected to give a decision until next week.

In a letter to the panel, Dr Hourmann stated he was unfamiliar with medical rules that state if a doctor has been cautioned, charged or convicted of a criminal offence, anywhere in the world, they must declare this to the profession’s regulatory body - namely, the GMC.

His explanation was not accepted by the GMC panel.

The doctor also told the panel in writing that he was 'afraid' to lose his freedom and his job.

The medic, who qualified as a doctor in Argentina and now lives in Spain, has been suspended from working as a doctor by the GMC.

Earlier, the GMC heard that on March 28 2005, Dr Hourmann was working at the Mora D’Ebre district hospital in Tarragona, Spain, when an 82-year-old 'extremely ill' cancer patient, referred to only as CR, was admitted.

The patient had advanced cancer of the colon and internal haemorrhaging and her family consented to her treatment by Dr Hourmann for 'sedative and palliative' care.

In June 2007, applying for a job with Carmarthenshire NHS Trust in the A&E department at the Prince Philip Hospital (above), Dr Hourmann denied there were past, present or pending prosecutions on his record

When the patient became unconscious, he injected her with 60mg of potassium chloride, a lethal dose.

Spanish court papers said the patient was 'begging for her suffering to be brought to an end' and Dr Hourmann may have thought, incorrectly, 'she was begging him to end her life', the GMC heard.

It took four years for the case to be resolved in Spain, when Dr Hourmann was convicted at the provincial high court in Tarragona under Spanish law of 'involuntary manslaughter' and 'attempting to co-operate in the suicide of a seriously ill person whose death is imminent'.

He was sentenced to one year in jail, which was suspended, and a further sentence of four months, 15 days' jail, substituted by him paying a fine of 1,620 euro (£1,359).

But less than a year after killing the woman - by February 2006 - he lied to get a job with the West Suffolk NHS Trust.

In a self-declaration form, he denied being under investigation, and in June 2007, applying for a job with Carmarthenshire NHS Trust in the A&E department at the Prince Philip Hospital, he again denied there were past, present or pending prosecutions on his record.

Dr Hourmann then applied for a job with Dyfed Powys Police in April 2008.

He was required to fill in forms, with one section asking whether he had any impending prosecutions or if he was the subject of a police investigation.

In fact he left that part of the form blank - and it appears no one at the force checked the form.

He worked for the force from May 2008 to October 2010 until his past history came to light, uncovered by the press.

The GMC has now found his non-disclosure to both the NHS trusts and the police amounts to dishonesty.

The hearing in Manchester continues.
