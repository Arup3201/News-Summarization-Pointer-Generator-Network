Spanish police have arrested a chemistry student suspected of planning a gas attack against protesters opposing to a visit by Pope Benedict XVI.

A demonstration against the pontiff's arrival is planned for Madrid tonight but the authorities acted swiftly after monitoring militant activity online.

His Holiness is due to arrive tomorrow for a nearly four-day visit to celebrate World Youth Day, which began its six days of festivities yesterday with a mass in the capital's Cibeles Square.

A police official said the suspect arrested in Madrid yesterday was a 24-year-old Mexican student specialising in organic chemistry.

She would not say whether investigators believed the man was actually capable of carrying out a gas attack, and did not know if the man actually had chemicals for an attack.

The Mexican Embassy identified the detainee as Jose Perez Bautista and said he was from Puebla state, near Mexico City.

Thousand of pilgrims from all over the world carrying flags from Great Britain, the United States, Germany, Russia, Jordan and, of course, Spain were waved proudly all day yesterday.

However, the papal visit is costing about 50m euro to stage and protesters are angry that the government is 
essentially spending taxpayer's money on the visit by granting tax 
breaks to corporate sponsors and perks such as discount subway and bus 
tickets for pilgrims.

Police now have 72 hours from the time of the arrest to take the detainee before a judge at the National Court for questioning or release him. A court official said he would appear before the judge tomorrow at the earliest.

The court official said the detainee had been making threats over the Internet against people in Spain opposed to the Pope's visit.

Sister Teresita, aged 103, will finally emerge into the outside world on Friday for a very special occasion.The nun will meet Pope Benedict XVI during his visit to the Spanish capital.Sister Teresita is a member of the Buenafuente del Sistal Convent, located 60 miles north of Madrid.She has been a resident at the convent since April 16, 1927. This, by coincidence, is the same day that Joesph Ratzinger - now Pope Benedict XVI - was born.The last time the centenarian left the compound was during the Spanish Civil war, which took place between 1936 and 1939.

Police said in a statement that officers
who searched his apartment in a wealthy district of Madrid seized an 
external hard-drive and two notebooks with chemical equations that had 
nothing to do with his studies.

The statement said the man had planned to attack anti-Pope protesters with 'suffocating gases' and other chemicals. But it did not mention police having confiscated chemicals that could be used in an attack.

The police official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with police rules.

The statement said the suspect was in Madrid studying with Spain's top government research body, the Spanish National Research Council and his office there was searched.

The council confirmed the arrest but gave no immediate details on the Mexican.
