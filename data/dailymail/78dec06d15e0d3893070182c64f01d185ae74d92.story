RBS is now accused of diverting tax payments by small businesses into its own accounts, depriving the taxpayer of millions

RBS employed a 'hit squad' that diverted tax payments from small businesses into the bank's own coffers, it has been claimed.

In a setup that deprived the Exchequer of millions of pounds of revenues, struggling firms saw their loans called in by the group's problem lending division.

In one instance, the bank - which is 82per cent owned by the taxpayer - told business owners it was 'not interested in what is owed to HMRC', and demanded repayment.

In some cases, this pushed otherwise solvent companies into administration.

The damning allegations come days after RBS was accused of killing off good businesses for profit.

It was accused of calling in loans and sending firms to the wall so it could pick up the companies' property at knock-down prices.

Now fresh allegations say the group, which is set to pay Â£500million in bonuses to staff this year, seized money earmarked for tax payments.

Cambridgeshire hotel owners Paul and Lucy Smith said they were not allowed to pay tax on the sale of one of their hotels.

They now face a huge tax bill after the bank, which told them it was 'not interested' in their bill to HMRC, took all of their funds for the repayment of a loan, according to the couple.

Another couple, Mike and Diane Hockin, said funds earmarked for VAT payments from their profitable property business were taken by RBS, plunging their business into administration and leaving them facing a fight with the taxman.

A spokesman for RBS said: 'When companies reach a very high level of distress, with insufficient funds to cover all their payments, we will help them manage their difficult cash flow problems.

'We try to ensure that essential costs, such as wages and fuel bills are met which enables the company to continue operating, and slowly bring down the level of debt with their creditors.

'It is the customer's role to direct us over which payments they would like to make.'
