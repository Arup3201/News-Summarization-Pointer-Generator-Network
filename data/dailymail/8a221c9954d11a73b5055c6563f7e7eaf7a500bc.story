The mother of a New York day trader who went missing in Mexico while travelling the world is demanding answers after human remains were found near his motorbike.

Harry Devert, 32, left New York for a transcontinental motorcycle journey, only to disappear on January 25 in a deeply troubled region.

Earlier this week it was revealed partially-buried human remains had been found near his rusting green Kawasaki motorbike. 

Ann Devert, of Pelham, New York, has travelled to the state to find out what happened to her son, but so far authorities have not revealed their findings.  

Harry Devert went missing after starting a lengthy road trip on a motorcycle that would take him across the U.S. and through parts of Central and South America

Devert, who held both French and U.S. citizenships, was an adventurer who had already spent five years traveling through Europe and South Asia

Jackie Burrell a family friend of the Deverts told  that Mrs Devert was working with the U.S. Embassy, French Embassy and Mexican authorities during the search for her son.

'She's down there and she continues the search,' said Burell. 'This is not confirmed. She's in complete control, she wants answers.'

Mrs Devert's lawyer Darren Del Sardo said: 'She's remaining optimistic and you know as she's doing the best she possibly could in this very trying time.

'There's still many questions unanswered. She's trying to act on a serious lead, where in [his] motorcycle was found or to get some sort of closure if in fact the remains are Harry's.'

Mrs Devert said  authorities took photographs of the motorcycle, including its vehicle identification number, or VIN, which matched his.

A sudden break has come in the case of missing New Yorker Harry Devert, an adventurer who vanished in Mexico

Local police say they found a body wrapped in plastic next to Mr Devert's abandoned motorcycle

The Pelham man quit his job in order to follow this route through America, which was posted on his travel blog

Risks: Mr Devert is a seasoned adventurer who had previously traveled around the world for years

Mr Devert, who held both French and U.S. citizenships, was an adventurer who had already spent five years traveling through Europe and South Asia, keeping friends and family up-to-date on his website anewyorkertravels.com.

One blog post begins like this: 'I’m the owner of a big smile and a broad taste for adventure.'

The last his girlfriend heard from Devert was on January 25.

He'd visited a monarch butterfly reserve in Michoacan state, home to a powerful organized crime group, and was headed to a beach on the Pacific coast where the final scene in the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption was filmed.

The beach is in adjacent Guerrero state.

A statement from the Guerrero office of public security Friday morning said authorities found the abandoned motorcycle along a dirt road leading to La Majahua beach in the township of Union Isidoro Montes de Oca.

The statement said authorities also found '10 packages of what appeared to be narcotics (marijuana and cocaine)' near the motorbike and body.

A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said issued a brief statement: 'We are aware of the news reports that indicate a motorcycle and human remains were discovered in the state of Guerrero near the town of Lagunillas and are working closely with the authorities to get more information.' 

'They’ve been great. Especially now that they’ve gotten something solid to go on,' she told me.

Harry Devert was heading for Brazil on his lengthy motorcycle journey, hoping to catch part of the World Cup soccer tournament, which ends this Sunday in Rio de Janeiro.

He was a 'mega' fan, his mother noted.

'He would come out of the jungle to see a game by Barcelona or Real Madrid,' she said.

Devert said she believes the remains may be of her son but is holding out hope that a crime gang could have launched a 'subterfuge' to delay a pending raid on a ranch known to hold kidnapping victims.

'I’m saying 55 (per cent) that it is Harry, but I’m holding on to that 45 (percent),' she said.
