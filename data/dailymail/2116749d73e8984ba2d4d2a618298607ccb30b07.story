The Duchess of York hugged Princess Eugenie in a heartfelt moment while visiting her in her new home of New York.

Sarah Ferguson's youngest daughter, 24, is well and truly flying the nest as she has just been made permanent in her new job in the Big Apple.

And her proud mother, 54, took the first opportunity to fly out and congratulate her, as the pair were spotted hand in hand on a day out in Soho yesterday.

Sarah and Eugenie took a stroll and went for lunch at a French restaurant, before pausing for a tender hug on the sidewalk.

In lovely matching fashion the pair strolled along in short black summery dresses and had bare legs.

Sarah's outfit featured white and pink accents and she comfy chose ballet pumps, while Eugenie opted for blue and tan accessories and wore block heel sandals.

She also carried a baseball cap which she wore and later removed.

Eugenie, 
who was expected to return to Britain, has done such an impressive job 
during a trial with online auction house Paddle8 that she will be kept 
on for good, and her mother clearly couldn't be more delighted for her.

She
 has spent the past 12 months in America, and will now extend her stay, 
with Paddle8 founder Alexander Gilkes describing her as a 'great asset 
to the team'.

And it looks as if she could be joined in New York by her boyfriend Jack Brooksbank.

The
 28-year-old was recently working at London nightspot Mahiki but his 
friend revealed: 'There are discussions going on about Jack finding a 
way to live there too if he can.'
