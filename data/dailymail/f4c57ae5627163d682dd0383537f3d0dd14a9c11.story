Three Gold Coast Titans players have been stood down from the team effective immediately amid the cocaine crisis currently rocking the NRL.

State of Origin  players Greg Bird and Dave Taylor are the latest players to be implicated in the scandal, and Gold Coast Titans CEO Graham Annesly announced in a press conference on Sunday evening they had been stood down. 

The big name rugby league players were both served with notices to appear in court on Sunday evening, according to the Courier Mail.

Mr Annesly confirmed these reports, but said he didn't have any further information.

Winger Kalifa Faifai Loa was also stood down on Sunday, after being charged earlier in the day. 

So far six players have been charged. Faifai Loa and former squad member Joe Vickery were charged on Sunday, whilst hooker Beau Falloon and fringe first grader Jamie Dowling were charged on Friday.

Mr Annesly said it was his understanding that no one else from his club was caught up in the controversy, but acknowledged the massive damage it was doing to the club.

'I don’t think anything would surprise me but my information is this is the last of it for our club,' he said on Sunday.

'To be constantly dragged through these kind of scandals this is incredibly damaging for the club.' 

The CEO also confirmed that players would be forced to cover their own legal costs for the potentially lengthy processes ahead, and said there would be a contractual review for those involved.

Dave Taylor is also one of the latest players to be implicated in the scandal

Mr Annesly also revealed that the NRL as a whole had been supportive of the club through recent times of turmoil.

'We've had nothing but support from the NRL right through this process.'

Last week it was revealed the career of code-hopping Queensland Reds Super Rugby star Karmichael Hunt was in serious doubt after he was arrested on charges of cocaine supply and possession along with, reportedly, two Gold Coast Titans rugby league players.

The charges are a result of an ongoing operation by Queensland's Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) and local police, focusing on a period between June (when Hunt was still an AFL player) and December of last year. Detectives questioned Hunt on Thursday night, ahead of his arrest.

Two other men, one identified by the Telegraph as being Gold Coast Titans player Beau Falloon, 27, are also understood to be facing counts of the same offence. Falloon was the Titans' NRL player of the year in 2014. A woman was also taken into custody.

Queensland Police believe they have broken up a drug cartel and are continuing investigations into other suspects.

Eight people have now been arrested in the ring, with four to appear in court on the drug charges.

Queensland's CCC said that four men are expected to front court in the coming days.

'Four men will face drug supply offences after being identified allegedly arranging the supply of cocaine during an ongoing drug trafficking investigation by the Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC),' a statement released on Sunday said.

'The CCC will allege that during an investigation focused on a cocaine trafficking syndicate operating in South East Queensland, these men were identified contacting the syndicate and arranging for the supply of cocaine.

'The CCC can confirm the four men were identified during the same CCC drug trafficking investigation as four other individuals who were served with a Notice to Appear in Court on Thursday 19 February 2015.'

The CCC statement also revealed a 26-year-old man from Burleigh Waters, a 31-year-old man from Mermaid Beach, a 25-year-old man from Burleigh Waters and a 25-year-old man from Miami were all served notices to appear in court.

The 26-year-old is facing one count of possesion, the 31-year-old two counts of supplying a dangerous drug, with the 25-year-old from Burleigh Waters is facing one supply charge.

The 25-year-old from Miami is facing seven counts of supplying a dangerous drug.

The Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) also released a statement on Friday, which said four people had been charged as part of an investigation into a cocaine trafficking syndicate in south-east Queensland.

Among them, it stated, was a 28-year-old man from Hendra who was facing four counts of drug supply and who is due to appear at the Southport Magistrates Court on March 5.

'During an investigation focused on a cocaine trafficking syndicate operating in southeast Queensland, these four individuals were identified contacting the syndicate and arranging for the supply of cocaine,' the CCC said in a statement.

If proved, the charges threaten to end a glittering sporting career just when Hunt appeared in the mix to cap it by playing for the Wallabies at the Rugby World Cup later this year.

It comes just weeks after another former Queensland rugby league representative, Jason Smith, was arrested and charged with trafficking offences.

He was taken into custody with a restaurant owner, Jason Wood, and the pair was charged with supplying the illicit substance between June and December of last year. Smith remains on bail and will reappear in Toowoomba Court again on May 6.  

Police prosecutors will also allege that former New South Wales Origin player Matt Seers had taken part in drug deals. Their bail conditions including having no contact with each other.

Hunt left rugby league to try his hand at AFL, playing 44 games for the Gold Coast Suns before signing to play rugby union for the Queensland Reds

Karmichael Hunt, 28, has played three codes of football in Australia. He was a rugby league international during his days as a Brisbane Broncos player before a high profile switch to AFL and the Gold Coast Suns. He is in custody following a police operation which has reportedly busted a drug syndicate

Hunt was on Thursday named at fullback for the Reds in their match against the Western Force at Suncorp Stadium on Saturday night but is unlikely to take his place.

The crisis led to the Reds postponing a pre-match captain's media conference on Friday morning, as reports of Hunt's arrest spread.

Both the Queensland Rugby Union (QRU) and the Australian Rugby Union (ARU), were scrambling to respond to the shock news.

The Reds, in particular, were in crisis mode with costly off-season signing Hunt having been named to play at fullback against the Western Force at Suncorp Stadium on Saturday night.

No comment was made but a joint statement was issued: 'The Australian Rugby Union and Queensland Rugby Union are aware of reports regarding Karmichael Hunt.'

'The ARU’s Integrity team and the Queensland Rugby Union are making enquiries into the reports.'

Similarly, the Suns released a statement: 'The Gold Coast Suns have been made aware of charges laid against Karmichael Hunt through the media reports this morning.'

'As this matter is now before the court, it would be inappropriate to make any comment.'

The Titans issued a short statement acknowledging the reports linking them to the operation.

'The club is aware of current media speculation in relation to police charges on the Gold Coast,' the statement said.

'We are currently trying to confirm the veracity of these reports and a public statement will be made immediately we have been able to do so.'

An NRL spokesman added that the game's governing body was 'seeking advice from the Titans on the matter.'

Hunt, 28, has played three codes of football in Australia, the only sportsman to have done so at the elite level. He is now facing four counts of supplying a dangerous drug after being arrested in a joint police operation

Hunt, 28, has played three codes of football in Australia, the only sportsman to have done so at the elite level.

He was a rugby league international during his days as a Brisbane Broncos player before a high profile switch to AFL and the Gold Coast Suns, where he played just 44 games in four years beset by injuries. 

The Crime Commission said: 'Three men and one woman will face drug supply offences after being identified allegedly arranging the supply of cocaine during an ongoing drug trafficking investigation'.

'The CCC will allege that during an investigation focused on a cocaine trafficking syndicate operating in South East Queensland, these four individuals were identified contacting the syndicate and arranging for the supply of cocaine.

'The CCC will allege the three men and one woman arranged for the supply of cocaine for personal use or to on-supply cocaine to friends and colleagues between June and December 2014.

'A 28-year-old man from Hendra was served with a notice to appear in court to face four counts of supply (a) dangerous drug.'

The Commission also reported the arrest of a 24-year-old man from Burleigh Waters on seven counts of possession and two counts of supply, a 27-year-old Mermaid Waters man and a 22-year-old woman, also of Mermaid Waters.
