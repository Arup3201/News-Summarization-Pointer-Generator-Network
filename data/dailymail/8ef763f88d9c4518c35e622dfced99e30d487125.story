Police forces have spent more than £250,000 on art for their offices and stations over the last five years, it was claimed today.

South Wales Police spent £75,000 on a lighthouse sculpture in Cardiff and Hampshire Constabulary put £48,000 towards sandblasting a floor design in Southampton, according to The Sun.

It also claimed Cleveland Police spent £25,000 on photographs in Hartlepool and the Metropolitan Police forked out £13,000 on portraits of former commissioners Sir Paul Stephenson and Sir Ian Blair.

Structure: Northumbria Police spent £50,000 in 2011 on a steel and glass sculpture outside its headquarters in Wallsend, North Tyneside - which it took delivery of on the day staff were told 450 jobs would go

The Mail revealed in 2010 how the London force had spent £9,000 on a taxpayer-funded portrait of Sir Ian, who posed clasping a glass bowl inscribed with the words 'Could have done better'.

It was his armed officers who shot dead an innocent Brazilian, Jean Charles de Menezes, while under the impression he was a terrorist in 2005 at Stockwell Underground station in South-West London.

It was then reported last year by The Times that the Met would spend £4,000 on the portrait of Sir Paul, who had been in charge for less than three years when he abruptly resigned in 2011.

A spokesman said that was the best value it could get from an artist after the procurement process.

Northumbria Police spent £50,000 in 2011 
on a steel and glass sculpture outside its headquarters in Wallsend, 
North Tyneside - which it took delivery of on the day staff were told 
450 jobs would go.

The structure, created by Newcastle-based
 artist Cate Watkinson - which some observers said looked like a ball 
bearing in a hula hoop - led the force to be accused of ‘crass 
insensitivity’.

But Northumbria Police Authority chair
 Cllr Mick Henry told the Mail on Sunday at the time: ‘The cost is a 
tiny proportion of the overall building costs. The artwork will give 
pleasure to visitors to the local community.’

Other costs found in Freedom of Information requests made by The Sun from 2008 to 2013 took the total to more than £250,000.

Eleanor
 McGrath, campaign manager of the TaxPayers' Alliance, told MailOnline: 
‘It’s ludicrous that police chiefs spent so much taxpayers’ cash on 
pieces of art.

‘Police stations are where officers are based and criminals are detained - they're not supposed to also act as a local Tate Modern.

‘At a time when budgets are tight, police chiefs should be spending taxpayers’ cash on fighting crime not buying abstract sculptures.’

Hampshire Constabulary and the Police Federation did not immediately return requests for comment when contacted by MailOnline today.

A Cleveland Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'The decision to fund the public art was made by the then Police Authority in 2007 as part of the refurbishment of the police station.

'The artwork remains in situ at the station’s entrance and no other artwork has been funded since.'

And Superintendent Danny Richards from South Wales Police said: ‘South Wales Police divisional headquarters in Cardiff opened in 2009 with 60 cells and state of the art facilities which have enabled more police officers to be on the streets for greater lengths of time.

‘It is a planning condition with new large public buildings that a percentage of the total cost of the project, usually around 1 per cent, is spent on a piece of art work.

‘The lighthouse, which cost 0.4 per cent of the total cost of the station, symbolises a point of safety and reflects the maritime history of Cardiff Bay.’
