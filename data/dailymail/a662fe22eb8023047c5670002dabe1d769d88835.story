This lioness was obviously finding her playful cub to be a bit of the pain in the neck after she clamped her jaws around its head give it a telling off.

The mother lion was clearly unimpressed with the mischievous juvenile’s antics when it tried to take a swipe at her.

So she grabbed it by the scruff of the neck with the cub's head wedged between her jaws - making it appear like she was about swallow whole the head of the cub.

That's quite a mouthful: This is the moment a lioness gave her cheeky cub a telling off by clamping her jaws around its head

And despite the cub's squirming, the mother lion refused to loosen her grip until she felt it had got the message to behave.

After a few minutes, she released it from her grip and dumped it on his backside in the dirt by way of a punishment.

The amusing moment was caught on camera by wildlife photographer Shanna Love in Botswana.

Ms Love, 26, from New South Wales, Australia, said: 'I came across this small lone lion cub sitting in the sun, but it soon decided to duck back into it’s den.

'From here he peeked out at us until we all heard the unmistakable call of his mother from the vegetation behind us.

'As she approached the cub he came racing out to meet her and playfully took a swipe at her.

'The next thing, she picked him up by the neck. He squirmed and squawked in protest before she dropped him on to his feet.

'When I looked at my photos later I saw I had one frame with the lioness’s mouth wrapped almost entirely around the neck of the cub.

'It was an amazing sight, I was very lucky to be positioned where I was and to get to watch a mother and her cub interact so naturally.'

Now that's told you: After making sure she has got her message across, the lioness then dumps her cub on the ground
