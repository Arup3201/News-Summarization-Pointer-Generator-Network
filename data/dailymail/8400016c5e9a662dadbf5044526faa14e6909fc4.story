Four homes had to be evacuated by authorities in South Amboy, New Jersey after a large sinkhole opened up and swallowed an SUV

A vehicle at the bottom of a large sinkhole in New Jersey March 24, 2015.  The large sinkhole, believed to have been caused by an underground water main break, forced the evacuations of four New Jersey homes about 20 miles south of Newark

No one was injured by the sinkhole which reportedly occurred because of a break in a water main. Residents reported seeing water running through their backyards for several days.  

The sinkhole appeared to be getting larger but fortunately for home owners, was spreading in the direction of woodlands. 

The sinkhole was discovered when a man reported his son's car stolen to police on Tuesday morning, only for officers to find it at the bottom of the crevasse.
