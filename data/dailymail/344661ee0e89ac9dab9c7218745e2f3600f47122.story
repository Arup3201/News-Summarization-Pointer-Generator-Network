To his children, he is both great-uncle and dad. 

This is the San Marcos, Texas man who pleaded guilty on Monday to having sex with his niece when she was just 12 years old, whom he later married and had four children with, according to the Seguin Gazette.

Esteban Chavez Castillo was sentenced to 17 years in prison for the heinous act, and at the age of 61 it may mean the rest of his life behind bars.  

Despicable: Esteban Chavez Castillo, 61 (pictured), pleaded guilty in Guadalupe County, Texas court on Monday to having sex with his niece, starting when she was just 12 years old

Castillo was arrested after his wife, now approximately 22 years old, checked into a women's shelter with their four children. 

She told authorities that Castillo was her uncle and that he started sleeping with her when she was just 12. He married her two years later, and fathered four children with her over the past 10 years, according to News 4 San Antonio. 

Castillo was initially charged with two counts of burglary habitation with intent to commit a felony, one count of aggravated sexual assault, one count of prohibited sexual conduct and one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, court records reveal. 

But most of these charges were dropped when Castillo  agreed to plead guilty to a charge of prohibited sexual conduct.

He could have faced a life in prison sentence if he was convicted on the initial charges.
