A Romanian gipsy couple were last night jailed for bringing a child into Britain and keeping her as a slave.

She was saved only when a 53-year-old
man similarly kept as a slave in the garden shed of the family’s London
council house escaped - and told police of a ‘Cinderella’ used as a 
servant.

Astonished officers found the 
seven-year-old girl had been forced to sleep on the floor, had no 
possessions beyond the filthy clothes she was wearing and had been 
‘beaten like a carpet’.

Jailed: Aurel Zlate, 46, and his 43-year-old wife Alexandra Oaie repeatedly beat and humiliated the girl and have now been jailed with their two son for a total of more than 40 years

She had been kept barefoot and eight of her black rotten teeth had to be removed.

She was unable to count to ten in her own language.

The family’s eight children, 
meanwhile, wore fashionable clothes, and were allowed to go to school – 
when not out working for their parents as trained thieves and beggars.

The family used money from crime and benefits to buy ‘palaces’ in Romania.

Judge Shani Barnes, who noted that 
much-criticised Haringey council had failed to respond to repeated 
reports of a man being kept in a shed, said she was appalled such crimes
could be committed in 21st-century London.

The shed where the Cinderella slavery victim was forced to live. The little girl was forced her to sleep on the floor and the family gave her no shoes and one pair of clothes

Yesterday husband and wife Aurel-Ilie
Zlatea, 45, and Alexandra Oaie, 44, and their sons Marian Neamu, 25, 
and Florin Zlatea, 23, were jailed for between nine and 13 years for a 
series of offences.

The sons had also battered and raped their adult slave after he asked for food on New Year’s Eve.

All maintained their innocence but 
were convicted at a six-week trial. Judge Barnes told them: ‘You stole 
this sweet and innocent little girl’s childhood by your neglect and 
cruelty.

I can only imagine the purpose was to train her as a servant 
for your family. There is no evidence of you giving her any care 
whatsoever.

By the time she was six she had been your servant for years.

‘She slept on the floor, never owned 
shoes, and had only the clothes she stood up in. She washed, cooked and 
cleaned for you, and was described as a Cinderella, while all your own 
children had fashionable clothes and went to school. No one had taken 
the time to talk to her or hold her.’

Judge Barnes told Croydon Crown Court
that the mother of the family, Oaie, was ‘cold, cynical and 
manipulative’ and that her ‘cruel nature’ was behind the ghastly living 
conditions suffered by both ‘slaves’.

The girl's shed where she was forced to live. It was revealed for the first time today that Haringey Council had continually been called to investigate the house, but did nothing until after the police became involved

Speaking of the man’s existence as a ‘filthy, cold, scavenging man living in a twilight misery’, the judge added: ‘It is hard to believe this was happening in leafy Wood Green in 2011.’

The jury heard that the family had employed the 53-year-old electrician at their luxury gated home in Romania, took his ID card and driving licence from him, and in 2010 brought him to Britain.

In London, he found the Cinderella girl working for the family. She had been a daughter of Zlatea’s cleaner, and he had persuaded her to give him the child ‘for a better life’.

The male captive was so shocked by the girl’s plight that he named her Cenusareasa, the Romanian name for Cinderella.

The man said the girl was ‘like a frightened animal’ who was forced to carry debris on a building site, and look after animals and other children who ‘beat her like she was a carpet’.

The youngster, who is now eight, is in foster care in Britain. Within weeks of being rescued, after emergency dental care, she had learnt to count and can now read and speak fluent English. She is said to be flourishing.

Zlatea was jailed for nine and a half years, Oaie for nine, and Marian and Florin for 13 and nine years respectively.

All four are due to be sent back to Romania on release, but Judge Barnes said: ‘I don’t have any guarantee that they will be deported.’

Detective Inspector Kevin Hyland said outside court: ‘It is hard to believe that something like this could be happening behind the closed doors of an ordinary house in Haringey. There was horror going on behind those curtains.’

The couple’s other children are being raised by relatives in Romania.

A spokesman for Haringey council said: ‘We are looking into exactly what happened in this case to ensure our procedures were correctly followed.’
