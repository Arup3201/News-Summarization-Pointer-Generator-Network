Banned: Jack3d contains a stimulant called DMAA

A sports supplement popular with fitness fanatics has been banned in Britain because of fears it may have lethal side-effects.

The drink Jack3D contains a stimulant known as DMAA (dimethylamylamine) that has been linked to high blood pressure, headaches, vomiting, stroke and even a death.

The UK’s medicines watchdog MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) has ruled it is unlicensed and all other DMAA containing products need to be removed from the market to protect public safety.

The decision follows similar warnings around the world, including in the US and Australia where a man died after buying DMAA online. 

Jack3d is said to boost energy, concentration and metabolism. But DMAA, most commonly used as a workout aid or dietary supplement, can have a physiological effect on the body by narrowing the arteries and raising the heart rate, said the MHRA.

This has been linked to suspected adverse drug reactions worldwide, ranging from shortness of breath to heart attacks.

An MHRA spokesperson said: 'Jack3d is mainly bought over the internet although it is also available in sports stores specialising in work out products.

'If we find a shop selling it we will send them a written reminder asking them to remove it from their shelves. If they ignore this then our enforcement officers will move in and begin legal action.

'It is the most popular sports supplement in the UK because it is a stimulant that allows you to work out for longer.

'But it is for people who are really into their fitness. Your average person who goes to the gym once or twice a week is unlikely to have ever used it.'

The MHRA has already issued eight urgent notices instructing retailers to remove the product and any other DMAA containing products from sale.

The MHRA has recently taken action against a number of products presented as sports supplements that fall within the definition of a medicinal product because of the potent herbal ingredients they contained.

The chemical ingredient DMAA is also on the prohibited list of banned substances by the World Anti-Doping Agency and has been responsible for 137 doping violations worldwide.

David Carter, manager of the MHRA’s Medicines Borderline Section, said: 'People need to be aware when choosing their sports supplements. These products may claim to increase performance but contain powerful ingredients which can have serious side effects.

'We recommend people only use approved products and speak to a qualified medical practitioner if they have any concerns about any supplements they may be taking.'

Relevant companies are advised to remove Jack3D from sale and to take similar action for other products containing DMAA, which is also known by many names including Methylhexanamine, Geranamine, Geranium oil and ‘Cranesbill’.

Graham Arthur, director of Legal at UK anti-doping, added: 'This is a significant step forward for all competitive athletes as methylhexaneamine (DMAA) is a banned substance ‘in-competition’ that frequently appears in over the counter and internet bought products but not clearly on the label.

'Athletes who use sports supplements need to choose reputable manufacturers who can justify their claims with scientific evidence, and have their products screened to minimise the risk of testing positive for a substance on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s Prohibited List.

'UK Anti-Doping continues to work closely with the MHRA to protect the health of athletes and to prevent doping in sport.'
