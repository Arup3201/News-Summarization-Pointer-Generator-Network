Crown Prosecution Service lawyers have been given tablet computers riddled with problems in a £5 million deal branded ‘a shambles’.

The CPS bought 4,700 of the tablets at £865 each to allow prosecutors to do away with bundles of paper in court.

But the devices could not show video evidence, so another £102,000 had to be spent on DVD players.

CPS staff complain that the computers are too heavy to hold through long hearings.

Prosecutors also say it is harder to flick through documents on the gadgets than in physical folders and that batteries can run out  at crucial moments in trials.

Another £1.5 million has been spent on software support and maintenance over the past two years, taking the total bill to more than £5.5 million.

Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry, who uncovered the spending spree  in a series of parliamentary questions, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Ministers have inflicted unprecedented cuts and upheaval on the CPS in recent years, and the result appears to be poor decision-making and false economies.

‘If these tablets aren’t even fit for purpose, then that is a shambles.’

A CPS spokesman said: ‘Digital working will eliminate the vast majority of paperwork and the wasted time and expense that comes with it.

'Electronic case files can now be transferred instantly between police, prosecutors and many magistrates’ courts, saving the cost of printing this information and the inconvenience of carrying heavy case files to court.

‘Our tablets enable prosecutors to efficiently present these cases in court. Inevitably some initial investment is needed to modernise the criminal justice system, but the long-term benefits and savings will outweigh this initial cost.’
