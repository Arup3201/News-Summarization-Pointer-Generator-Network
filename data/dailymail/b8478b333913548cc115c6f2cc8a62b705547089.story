The UN Security Council has rejected a resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict calling for an Israeli withdrawal from occupied areas and the establishment of a Palestinian state by late 2017.

The resolution had been put forward by Palestine and was rebuffed by the council on Tuesday after it failed to receive the minimum nine votes.

The draft called for negotiations to be based on
territorial lines that existed before Israel captured the West
Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East
war. It also called for a peace deal within 12 months.

Even if the proposal had received the minimum nine votes in
favor, it would have been defeated by Washington's vote against
it. The United States is one of the five veto-wielding permanent
members.

There were eight votes in favor, including France, Russia
and China, two against and five abstentions, among them Britain.
Australia joined the United States in voting against the
measure.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power
defended Washington's position against the draft in a speech to
the 15-nation council by saying it was not a vote against peace
between Israel and the Palestinians.

'The United States every day searches for new ways to take
constructive steps to support the parties in making progress
toward achieving a negotiated settlement,' she said. 

'The
Security Council resolution put before us today is not one of
those constructive steps.'

The UN Security Council rejected the resolution brought by Palestine, which called for establishment of a Palestinian state by late 2017 and Israeli withdrawal from occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem 

Critique: Samantha Power, the United States' ambassador to the United Nations said the resolution was not a constructive step towards peace 

She said the text was 'deeply imbalanced' and contained
'unconstructive deadlines that take no account of Israel's
legitimate security concerns.' To make matters worse, Power
said, it 'was put to a vote without a discussion or due
consideration among council members.'

She did not spare Israel either. 'Today's vote should not be
interpreted as a victory for an unsustainable status quo,' Power
said, adding that Washington would oppose actions by either side
that undermined peace efforts, whether 'in the form of
settlement activity or imbalanced draft resolutions.'

Jordanian Ambassador Dina Kawar, the sole Arab
representative on the council, expressed regret that the
resolution was voted down, while noting that she thought council
members should have had more time to discuss the proposal.

The defeat of the resolution was not surprising. Washington,
council diplomats said, had made clear it did not want such a
resolution put to a vote before Israel's election in March.

The Palestinians, the diplomats said, insisted on putting
the resolution to a vote despite the fact that it was clear
Washington would not let it pass. Their sudden announcement last
weekend that Ramallah wanted a vote before the new year
surprised Western delegations on the council. 

In order to pass, a resolution needs nine votes in favor and
no vetoes from the council's five permanent members.

The European and African camps were split in the vote.
France and Luxembourg voted in favor of the resolution while
Britain and Lithuania abstained. Among the Africans, Chad voted
yes while Rwanda and Nigeria abstained.

The Palestinians, frustrated by the lack of progress in
peace talks, have sought to internationalize the issue by
seeking U.N. membership and recognition of statehood via
membership in international organizations.

Palestinian observer Riyad Mansour thanked delegations that
voted for the resolution, noting that lawmakers in a number of
European countries have called for recognition of Palestine. He
said it was time to end the 'abhorrent Israeli occupation and
impunity that has brought our people so much suffering.'

'It is thus most regrettable that the Security Council
remains paralyzed,' he said.

Mansour added that the Palestinian leadership 'must now
consider its next steps.' The Palestinians have threatened to
join the International Criminal Court, which they could then use
as a forum to push for war crimes proceedings against Israel.

In a brief statement, Israeli delegate Israel Nitzan said
the Palestinians have found every possible opportunity to avoid
direct negotiations and brought the council 'a preposterous
unilateral proposal.'

'I have news for the Palestinians - you cannot agitate and
provoke your way to a state,' he said.

French Ambassador Francois Delattre said Paris would
continue its efforts to get a resolution through the council
that would help move peace efforts forward.

'France regrets that it isn't possible to reach a consensus
today,' he said, noting that he voted for the resolution despite
having reservations about its contents. 'Our efforts must not
stop here. It is our responsibility to try again.'

An earlier Palestinian draft called for Jerusalem to be the
shared capital of Israel and a Palestinian state. The draft that
was voted on reverted to a harder line, saying only that East
Jerusalem would be Palestine's capital and calling for an end to
Israeli settlement building.

The Israeli government had said that a Security Council
vote, following the collapse in April of U.S.-brokered talks on
Palestinian statehood, would only deepen the conflict.

Israel, which pulled troops and settlers out of the Gaza
Strip in 2005, has said its eastern border would be indefensible
if it withdrew completely from the West Bank.
