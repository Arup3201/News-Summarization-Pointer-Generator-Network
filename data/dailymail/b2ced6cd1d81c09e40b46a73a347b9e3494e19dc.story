If you thought a towel was enough on the beach or by the pool, you might want to think again.

US brand Hanmacher Schlemmers is looking to convince consumers that their sunbathing would benefit from a £2,375 ($4,000) solar panelled lounger.

The folding chair doubles up as an entertainment centre and is the Ferrari of the outdoor furniture world.

It comes with built-in high quality speakers and a USB port to charge your phone, Kindle and iPod with – all powered by the sun.

The two 10-watt solar panels sit tucked away at either side of the chair’s base and take four hours to fully recharge a 12-volt battery.

If you overheat while sunbathing, you can use a button on the arm rest to activate a water mister which will spray you with water from a concealed six gallon tank. That’s a lot of misting.

You can control the angle of recline from another button on the armrest and Bose speakers are on hand to sync wirelessly with any Bluetooth-enabled device and blast out your best summer anthem.

The striped blue seat comes with a waterproof cushion for your head and there’s a detachable awning for shade, if you need.

The aluminium frame supports a weight of up to 136 kilograms, which is only slightly more than a baby elephant.

Just don't ask what happens if you get typically British cloudy weather for days on end.
