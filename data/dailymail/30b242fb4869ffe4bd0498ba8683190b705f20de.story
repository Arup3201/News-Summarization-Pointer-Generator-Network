A bus driver accused of serious neglect after she allegedly left a disabled pensioner trapped on a mini-bus for 14 hours appeared in court today.

Council worker Susan McLaughlin, 43, abandoned Joan Cook, an elderly woman with Alzheimer’s disease, in the mini-bus at a bus depot in Luton, Bedfordshire where she was trapped overnight on May 2.

Ms Cook was discovered alone and confused in the mini-bus after Ms McLaughlin allegedly left her there in what Prosecutor Shaaeeda Paurveen said was ‘a case of serious neglect’.

Serious neglect: Susan McLaughlin faced court after she allegedly left a pensioner with Alzheimer's disease trapped on a mini-bus for 14 hours in a bus depot in Luton, Bedfordshire

Believed to be in her 80s, Ms Cook was picked up from her sheltered accommodation by a council-run bus service but was never taken back home at Jill Jenkins Court in Farley Hill, Luton.

The Westminster Housing Association raised the alarm when Ms Cook failed to be dropped off at 5.30pm that same day as expected.

Shaken: Ms McLaughlin visibly shook in Luton Magistrates Court today as she faced charges of neglect and falsifying records

Miss Paurveen said: ‘Even if the matter 
is adjourned to a later date, we will be putting forward the case, 
suggesting it go straight up to the Crown Court.’

Ms McLaughlin, who has been suspended from her job at Luton Borough Council, visibly shook as she appeared before Luton Magistrates Court in Luton today. 

The woman from Luton entered no plea against charges of neglect under the section 44 Mental Capacity Act 2005, failing to ensure the transportation of a person with a lack of mental capacity and a second charge of falsifying records.

Speaking for Ms McLaughlin, a representative for Bedford Solicitors requested the case be adjourned due to lack of papers and reports relating to the case.

The case was adjourned until August 22 where it is expected to be committed to the Crown Court. 

Ms McLaughlin is currently on unconditional bail.
