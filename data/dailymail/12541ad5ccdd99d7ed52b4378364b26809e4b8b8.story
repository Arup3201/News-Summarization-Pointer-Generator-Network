'Little princess': Lia Green's death was not caused by a playground accident but by 'significant violence'

The death of a three-year-old girl amid claims she fell from a child's swing was 'most definitely not an accident', police believe.

Lia Green - described as a 'little princess' - was rushed to hospital from her home in Preston last month after she collapsed in front of her parents.

The youngster died on arrival at Royal Preston Hospital in Lancashire as a result of significant internal injuries, despite attempts by paramedics to save her.

Lia's parents Richard Green, 22, and Natalie Critchley, 20, were arrested on suspicion of murder, before being freed on bail pending further investigations. The couple have protested their innocence.

Detectives leading the investigation into Lia's death have now said their inquiry is being hampered by suggestions her injuries were caused by a playground fall, and insisted 'this most definitely was not an accident'.

Detective Superintendent Dermott Horrigan, who is leading the investigation, said: 'There may well have been a fall from the swing but what I'm saying, and what I've been told, is the injuries did not arise as a result of that fall.

'They were inflicted upon her by somebody using significant violence. The injuries are to her internal organs around her abdominal region.'

He added: 'These are not injuries that cause instantaneous death but do cause death over a period of time.'Lia, said by her family to be a 'normal, healthy' three-year-old girl, collapsed in front of her parents at 8am on August 30 and was rushed to hospital after they dialled 999, where she later died.

The couple were arrested and questioned for up to four days by police after tests showed Lia died as a result of 'significant internal injuries caused by violence'.

'Hampered': Det Supt Dermott Horrigan from Lancashire Police said the inquiry was being hampered by a belief in the community that Lia's death was a tragic accident

They later went into hiding after getting death threats on Facebook. But they insisted they were innocent amid claims Lia may have injured herself whilst toddling around a children’s playground the day before she died.

At the time Green posted a misspelt message on his Facebook page saying: 'Going off fb now as i said i aint descussed the case. dnt believe wt u hear cus it aint true.'

A further post-mortem was due to take place on Thursday at the request of lawyers acting for the pair.

But Det. Supt. Horrigan said: 'Our investigations have, to a degree, been hampered by the fact that many people in the community, many associates believe that Lia’s death was due to a tragic accident and specifically that she had fallen off a swing in the day or so before her death and that this resulted in her death.

'That is not the case - this most definitely was not an accident for cause of death, it was very much the fact that somebody has inflicted violence upon her and we need to identify who that person is.'

Appeal: Lancashire Police are now urging people in Preston to come forward with information that may help them to solve the murder investigation

The officer went on: 'As a result of Lia’s death a post-mortem was undertaken by a home office pathologist and determined the cause of death was a result of significant violence that was inflicted upon Lia, and that this in turn had caused significant internal injuries to her, resulting in her death.”

'We have conducted a complex and thorough investigation into Lia’s death and we’ve spoken to many people about sightings of Lia, who Lia was with, and are particularly interested in looking at the two days prior to Lia’s death.

'I would like to know where she was, who she was with, what she looked like - anything that anybody can tell us about her.'

The three-year-old spent time at a playground in Brooke Street, Preston, with her father, her one-year-old sister, and another unidentified individual the day before she was rushed to hospital.

The playground was at Brooke Street, Preston, where she was playing the day before with her father and her one-year-old sister and another unindentified individual.

Earlier this month Lia’s grandfather Steve Rimmer, 47, said the girl's parents were staying at a hotel and 'just wanted to be left alone to grieve', but claimed they feared for their safety because they had received death threats online.'Nothing is adding up at the moment,' Mr Rimmer said at the time.

'Why would Lia be running around in a park if she was feeling so ill? There are so many things which don’t make sense.

'I only saw Lia two weeks ago at a family christening. She was a normal healthy three-year-old girl - a lovely girl so full of life.

'It just seems so unreal at the moment and no-one can quite get their head around how this has happened.'

The couple will answer bail in Preston on October 16. The family are understood to have been known to police and social services, but there was nothing of 'significant concern'.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
