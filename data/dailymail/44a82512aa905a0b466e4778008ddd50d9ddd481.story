A mother who stabbed her three young children to death has been found dead in a high security hospital.

Theresa Riggi, 50, was found at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire in the early hours of this morning.

Riggi was jailed at Edinburgh High Court 
for 16 years for killing her eight-year-old twins Austin and Luke and 
her five-year-old daughter Cecilia at their home in August 2010.

Riggi killed her three children - twins Austin and Luke, eight, and five-year-old Cecilia (pictured). Their bodies were discovered in an Edinburgh flat in 2010

Their bloodstained bodies were discovered lying side by side in the Slateford Road, Edinburgh, property following a gas explosion at the building, each with eight stab wounds.

US-born
 Riggi was initially charged with murder - but admitted three counts of 
the lesser charge of culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished 
responsibility.

She was moved to the high security hospital in 2011.

Police confirmed they were called to the unit today to the death of a woman. They added they were not treating the death as suspicious.

At the time of the case, the court heard the bodies of the three children were found by building manager Derek Knight on the afternoon of August 4, following a loud explosion at the property.

When police entered the house they saw the three children lying side by side on the bedroom floor.

They also found three knives nearby, each covered in blood, and noted large amounts of blood in numerous places throughout the house.

Paramedics who went to the scene believed the children had been dead for some hours.

Pathologists found all three children had multiple bruises and abrasions and died of stab wounds to the chest.

On that day, neighbour Jordan Cochrane, saw Riggi climb on to the balcony after the blast before 'intentionally' falling head first.

He
 managed to break her fall but she was found to have four or five stab 
wounds, a collapsed lung, cuts to her neck and wrist and fractures.

At a previous hearing, the court heard both Riggi and her husband Pasquale, although separated, were living in Aberdeen before Riggi took the children to live at the Slateford Road property. It was stated she took the children unknown to Mr Riggi.

The court heard how the couple had been involved in a legal action over the children's custody at the time of the killings.

At the time, Alex Prentice QC, prosecuting, said the couple had been due to appear at a hearing the day before the youngsters' deaths.

Riggi admitted culpable homicide on grounds of diminished responsibility. She was held at Cornton Vale Prison, near Stirling, but after a string of alleged attacks in 2011 she was moved to Rampton Secure Hospital

Days before the killings, Riggi told a friend things were so bad he would 'hear about it on the national news'.

On
 the evening of August 2, Riggi spoke to her husband on the phone. Mr 
Prentice said she accused him of being in collusion with their 
solicitors and asked if he would take the children away.

On being told she 'left him no choice', Riggi replied 'say goodbye then' and hung up.

The couple had previously lived together in the U.S., the Netherlands and Lowestoft, Suffolk.

The court heard a report into Riggi's mental state - which identified narcissistic, paranoid and hysterical personality disorders.

Jailing her at the High Court in Glasgow, Lord Bracadale said: 'You have pled guilty to charges of repeatedly stabbing to death each of your twin sons, Austin and Luke, and your daughter Cecilia, aged five years.

'The result of these acts is a devastating family tragedy. The father of the children, Pasquale Riggi, and the wider family have been left utterly bereft by the loss of the children.

'And you, who had a genuine but abnormal and possessive love of your children, have lost them and are brought to this sorry pass.'

He added: 'You, and others, must understand that while your responsibility is diminished, you are still responsible for your actions.

'The effect of the diminished responsibility is to reduce these crimes from what would have been exceptionally wicked crimes of murder to what are still very serious crimes of culpable homicide.

Outside court, Pasquale Riggi stood as a 
statement was read out on his behalf. It spoke of his 'wonderful, 
energetic, bright and happy' children who were taken away by a 'selfish,
 brutal and murderous' act.

In the statement read by David 
Sinclair, of Victim Support Scotland, Mr Riggi said: 'I will never 
forget Austin, Luke and Cecilia. They left everlasting impressions on 
me. I think about them at least 100 times each day. They are in my 
thoughts when I wake in the morning and before I go to sleep at night.

'They
 were such wonderful energetic, bright and happy children. Those of us 
who had the pleasure of knowing Cecilia, Luke and Austin, looked forward
 to watching them grow while they independently navigate through their 
unique life journeys.

'We are so thankful for the opportunity we 
had to know and love them and the memories that we made together, 
allowing us to cherish them so dearly now."

He added: "The 
horrific manner in which my children died will leave an indelible mark 
on the rest of my life. As a father, my natural instincts were geared 
towards safeguarding my children from the dangers of this world.

'It
 pains me to the core that I was unable to protect them from the 
selfish, brutal and murderous act that ended their lives so unfairly.

In statement Mr Riggi read after his wife was jailed said: 'The horrific manner in which my children died will leave an indelible mark on the rest of my life'

'There
 is no justification for this heinous crime, repeated three times, nor 
is there any sentence that can provide justice for the overwhelming loss
 of three lives and the subsequent painful grief and devastation caused 
to surviving family and friends.'

Riggi was held at Cornton Vale Prison, near Stirling, but after a string of alleged attacks from other inmates in 2011 she was moved to Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.

Riggi was found dead at the unit today.

A Nottinghamshire Police spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that we were called to Rampton in the early hours of this morning to the death of a woman.

'It's not being treated as suspicious and we are preparing a file for the coroner.’

At the time, the court heard how Riggi had been 'possessive' towards her children from birth

Theresa Riggi, described in court as a paranoid and hysterical woman, might have stabbed her children to death because she believed it was the only way of keeping them safe.

Riggi, who was locked in a custody battle with her husband, loved her sons and daughter 'too much', according to her lawyer Donald Findlay QC.

Her 'possessive' attitude towards the children had been evident since their birth, the court was told on that day.

She insisted they wore electronic 'locators', controlled by her when they were in public places, and later that they carry mobile phones pre-programmed to call her number.

The situation worsened when she and her husband Pasquale Riggi began divorce proceedings which led to a bitter battle for custody of their children.

Riggi, from California in the U.S., came to live in the UK 13 years ago with her husband, a Shell employee from Colorado, moving to Aberdeen in February 2007. They later separated.

Mrs Riggi and the children disappeared from their Aberdeen home in July and were traced to an address in Edinburgh.

A judge warned they could be in danger just 24 hours before their death when Riggi failed to appear at a divorce hearing that day.

In court Alex Prentice QC, prosecuting, said that on the evening of August 2, at around 11.30pm, Riggi spoke to her husband on the phone.

Mr Prentice said she accused him of being in collusion with their solicitors and asked if he would take the children away.

On being told that she 'left him no choice', Riggi replied: 'Say goodbye then.' And she hung up.

Two days later building manager Derek Knight found the bodies of the three children after a gas explosion at houses in Slateford Road, Edinburgh, where Riggi was staying in a property rented by a friend.

Riggi was seen rocking back and forth on the second-floor balcony of the property before she 'intentionally' fell head-first, the court was told.

She sustained several injuries, including four to five stab wounds to her body, which were believed to have been self-inflicted, and spent weeks in hospital, making her first court appearances there when part of the infirmary was temporarily designated as a court.

When police entered the house in Slateford Road, they saw the three children lying side by side on the floor. They also found three knives nearby, each covered in blood.

Mr Findlay told the court she was intent on suicide on the day of the killings and had left a space for herself between the children's bodies. He said that, if possible, 'she loved them too much'.

A report into Riggi's mental state identified narcissistic, paranoid and hysterical personality disorders.
