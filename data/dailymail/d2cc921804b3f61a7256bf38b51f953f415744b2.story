New York Yankees prospect Jose Pirela was taken to a hospital after crashing into the center field wall on a play in the first inning that ended up an inside-the-park home run for the Mets' Juan Lagares.

Lagares' drive off CC Sabathia — the left-hander's third pitch of the game Sunday — was just out of Pirela's reach on the warning track.

The center fielder's momentum carried him into the wall, where he appeared to crash face first.

Pirela then fell and hit the back of his head on the track. He tried sitting up but went onto his back.

CBS Sports reports that he underwent a CT scan and has a concussion.

That story notes that a concussion may have ruined this season's chances of making it to the big leagues.

The player reportedly underwent a CT scan at the hospital 

With manager Joe Girardi looking on, a Yankees trainer examined Pirela, a versatile 25 year old who has played several positions this spring. Pirela was able to walk and was helped into a golf cart.

He was taken by ambulance from the Mets' complex.

Before the game, Girard said Pirela brought considerable value to the club.

'He provides excitement with his speed, and we're moving him all around. We think he could possibly help us in a lot of different spots,' Girardi said. 'That makes a player very valuable when he can play four or five different spots on a field. That flexibility is a great thing to have.'
