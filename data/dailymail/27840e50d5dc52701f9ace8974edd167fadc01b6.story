With the recent revelations that their firm’s profits tripled to more than £45million last year, it’s clearly no surprise that these men are living in luxury.

Errol Damelin and Jonty Hurwitz, founders of payday loans firm company Wonga, live in a beautiful  six-bedroom house in North London and £2million five-bedroom West Sussex home respectively.

Mr Hurwitz, 43, who left his chief technical officer role last November to invest in the sciences and arts, but still sits on the board, lives in a home with its own fishing lake, hot tub and tennis court.

Big money: Chief executive Errol Damelin, 42, who is said to have earned £1.6million last year, lives in a six-bedroom, four-bathroom house in North London, and has a white BMW X5 parked in the driveway

Chief executive Mr Damelin, 42, who is said to have earned £1.6million last year, lives in the six-bedroom, four-bathroom house, and has a BMW X5 parked in the driveway, reported the Sun.

Wonga, which sponsors Blackpool Football Club, has enjoyed huge growth to become worth around £384million, with an astonishing representative annual percentage rate on loans of 4,214 per cent.

Meanwhile the chairman of Dawn Capital, one of Wonga’s biggest stockholders, is Adrian Beecroft, and he lives in a £6.5million North London home. But that's not the only amazing house he owns.

In addition the 65-year-old venture capitalist and Conservative Party donor has a plush £2.75million five-bedroom townhouse, also in North London, and even a castle in Oxfordshire, reported the Sun.

'Anyone who thinks the big profits Wonga announced 
this week is a sign of a healthy British market needs their head 
examined'

Creasy MP

A Wonga spokesman said its success is down to ‘a very high level of customer satisfaction and industry-leading low arrears rates’ and that the company makes ‘very careful lending decisions’.

He added that it always checks customers have a ‘full bank account, regular income and access to range of credit providers’ and it’s proud to be ‘building a British business success story’.

But shadow home affairs minister Stella Creasy MP told the Sun: ‘Anyone who thinks the big profits Wonga announced this week is a sign of a healthy British market needs their head examined.’
