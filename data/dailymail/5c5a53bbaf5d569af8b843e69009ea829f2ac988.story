Benefits claimants cheats are able to keep money they are not entitled to because government officials fail to turn up to legal hearings, it emerged today.

The Department for Work and Pensions sent lawyers to just 4 per cent of tribunals held last year to rule on decisions to cut benefits.

It means that in many cases people are able to successfully argue in favour of keeping their money, because the government has failed to turn up to challenge it.

Thousands of people who appeal against cuts to their benefit stand a better chance of success if the DWP don't turn up

Without a DWP official, judges refer written submissions and lawyers suggest it means the case is more likely to be won by someone appealing to keep their benefits

Official figures also show that the DWP is more likely to win cases if it manages to send someone to the tribunal.

There were some 250,000 benefits tribunals last year, as many more people tried to challenged to the welfare system forced through by Iain Duncan Smith.

The Work and Pensions Secretary’s decision to force millions of people to face new medical checks and work assessments has led to many people losing benefits, triggering a surge in legal challenges.

Labour's Sadiq Khan criticised the government for the soaring number of tribunals

Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Government expenditure is under enormous pressure and instead of saving money, the Ministry of Justice is actually spending more taxpayers’ money on spiralling numbers of tribunal cases. 

'It's a double whammy. Over the last three years, there’s been a shocking 35 per cent rise in the number of tribunals dealing with decisions made by government departments.'

From April to December 2013 last year, only 4.3 per cent of cases had an official from DWP, the Telegraph reported. In 2010 the figure was 8 per cent and in 200 was 40 per cent.

However, the government’s own figures show that claimants are more likely to win their case if an official is not there.

When an officer was present, just 41 per cent of benefits claimants won their case.

But the figure rose to 50 per cent when there was no presenting officer from DWP.

Solicitor Joseph Hughes said: ‘If I was an appellant I’d rather have no representation any day than have somebody turn up,' he said. 'You can’t properly test or cross examine the evidence. There’s no-one to answer them back.’

Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: ‘It's yet another sign of the chaos and incompetence that now reigns at the Department of Work and Pensions, and the utter failure of this government to get a real grip on benefits spending.’

Justice minister Shailesh Vara said: ‘It is a matter for the relevant Department or local authority as to whether they send a presenting Officer to an appeal unless directed to do so by the Tribunal.

‘Departments and local authorities will consider each appeal on a case by case basis.

The DWP played down the idea that it loses more appeals because it fails to send officers to court, but admitted it had down ‘no studies’ into the issue.
