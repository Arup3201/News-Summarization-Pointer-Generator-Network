On paper, there is little doubt that Yaya Toure is Manchester City's most valuable player.

Manuel Pellegrini may have a squad of stars, expensively assembled and with world class back-up in every position, but without their midfield general they are a different side.

Since Toure left to join up with the Ivory Coast for the current Africa Cup of Nations, City have failed to win a single game.

While a draw away at Chelsea was viewed by some as a positive result, and certainly a positive performance, the other three games have been a disappointment.

Defeat to Arsenal, their first at the Etihad since 2010, was followed by the dismal FA Cup exit at the hands of Middlesbrough. Throw in a draw with Everton, and the last month has been little short of a disaster.

In fact, City haven't managed a Premier League win without his powerful midfielder since April of last year. His return cannot come quick enough.

After Sunday's final, win or lose, City will be desperate to get their stars back to the Etihad, if possible ahead of a tricky mid-week trip to Stoke.

But, if they have been paying attention to his performances here in Equatorial Guinea, Pellegrini and his staff might have a few worries.

Played as a holding midfielder, Toure has been a shadow of his usual self at this tournament.

While at City he runs the show, driving past players, making tackles, scoring goals and providing assists, at the Cup of Nations he has practically been a bystander as his team-mates have carried him to the verge of a major trophy. Even a stunning strike against DR Congo couldn't mask another below-par performance.

Toure has never hit the same heights for his country as in his illustrious club career, but even more than in previous tournaments, the midfielder has been off the pace.

Being outshone in midfield on Wednesday night by Chancel Mbemba, the Anderlecht centre-half playing as a makeshift midfielder, was a low point.

It is tempting to say that five games in just 15 days might have taken a lot out of him, but he has offered so little on the pitch that tiredness can only be part of the problem.

Some onlookers have suggested that Toure is carrying an injury, which would be more bad news for Pellegrini. Certainly he is not moving comfortably, his movement restricted by more than just positional discipline. For long periods in Bata he was moving at little more than walking pace.

After Serge Kanon scored the Ivory Coast's third goal in Bata, ten Ivorian players charged to the bench to celebrate. By the time they had finished, and returned to the pitch, Toure, had barely reached the edge of the penalty area, trudging back alone.

There is no doubt that the 31-year-old is still a leader. During the warm-up before Wednesday night's game he gave what looked like a rousing speech to his players. Anyone who saw it would laugh off the suggestion that he 'doesn't care' about playing for his country.

But, more and more, his leadership seems to be coming through words, and not the all-action performances we know he can provide.

Even off the pitch he has not been his usual self. Most teams here have put their captain forward to talk to the press before and after every game. Here, Yaya has spoken just once, before his country's opener against Guinea.

Aside from that he has shunned all interviews, merely walking past journalists saying 'there is no problem' after he had been replaced against Cameroon.

It may be that City's star has been stung by criticism of his performances. Ivorian coach Herve Renard implied that his captain had been answering his critics with his fabulous goal that opened the scoring against DR Congo.

But if Toure is trying his utmost to prove people wrong on the pitch by showing his best form, then the best he can manage is some way beneath the standard we have come to expect.

Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping the midfielder can rediscover the form that led City to the title last year

As he stormed past the waiting media again on Wednesday night, without so much as a word, it was clear for all to see - something is not right with Yaya Toure.

Manuel Pellegrini must hope that, when he returns to Manchester next week, he can rediscover the form that led City to the title last year.

Because if the Toure of the Cup of Nations returns, instead of the Toure of 2014, City can kiss their title aspirations goodbye.
