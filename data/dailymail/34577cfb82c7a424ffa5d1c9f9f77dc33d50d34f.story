Holiday giant Thomas Cook is struggling for survival following a slump in bookings and fears it is having difficulty repaying bank loans totalling £1billion.

The firm, founded in 1841, is under threat as families cut back on sunshine holidays.

The value of shares in the company, now German-owned, slumped by 75 per cent yesterday after it said it is talking to banks about re-financing its debts.

Vulnerable: The latest announcement comes after reports that Thomas Cook could close 200 travel agencies

Earlier this year the company revealed a drop in bookings and issued three profit warnings.

The firm, which was the world’s first 
package holiday company, sells 22million trips a year to families in 
Britain and 20 other countries.

Executives yesterday insisted that 
trading is robust and there is no danger to the holidays or travel plans
of its millions of British customers.

But James Hollins, analyst at 
investment bank Evolution Securities, said: ‘Legitimate questions will 
be asked as to whether Thomas Cook can survive long-term.’

Bosses are looking at immediate cost 
cutting measures, including closing more than 200 of its travel agent 
outlets on high streets, threatening thousands of jobs.

The company, Europe’s second biggest 
tour operator after TUI Travel, suddenly parted company with its chief 
executive, Manny Fontenla-Novoa, in the summer.

The new interim chief executive, Sam 
Weihagen, said that trading had deteriorated in recent months, with poor
bookings for this winter and for summer next year.

He blamed the lack of bookings on the 
eurozone crisis and resulting financial turmoil which has led to 
families abandoning luxuries, including foreign holidays.

Unrest caused by the Arab Spring 
especially in Egypt and Tunisia – popular destinations with 
holidaymakers from its key markets in the UK, France and Russia – had 
also hit the business harder than expected.

Despite the collapse in the share 
price, which meant it is down 93 per cent since January, Mr Weihagen 
insisted the company is a ‘robust business that has a great future’.

The group insisted it had not fallen 
behind with any of its bank loan repayments and Mr Weihagen  said the 
talks with its lenders were an act of ‘prudence’.

He added: ‘We’re operating business as usual. Flights are leaving on schedule, shops are open and we’re taking bookings.’

The travel industry trade body, ABTA, 
also reassured consumers, saying all flights and package holidays sold 
by the firm are protected.

ABTA spokesman Victoria Bacon insisted that customers can continue to make bookings for next year with confidence.

‘The key thing is that anyone who has 
booked a holiday with them is protected,’ she said. ‘People can go ahead
and book as normal.’
