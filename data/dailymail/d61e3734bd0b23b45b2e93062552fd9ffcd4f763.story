To begin with, Mark Cavendish seems like he might rank among the more challenging interviewees. He anticipates questions before they’ve been asked, refuses to give an answer to some and offers monosyllabic responses to others.

He curses when he talks about the doping scandals in his sport and complains that the newspapers only cover such stories in cycling.

Has he not read the recent coverage of similar scandals in athletics and rugby? With a wry smile, he accepts that he hasn’t.

Help for Heroes patron Cavendish is confident he's not past his best following his 11 wins in 2014 

Cavendish believes he doesn't get the media coverage he deserves because he no longer rides for Team Sky

It might be that we’ve got off on the wrong foot. We meet in the bar of a hotel in Windsor and I congratulate him on his victory in Belgium the previous day. I remark that he’s had a ‘couple’ of good wins already this season. ‘I’ve had six,’ he responds a little tersely.

But this is what makes him interesting beyond his brilliance at the business end of professional bike racing, beyond the explosive drama of a peloton hurtling towards the finish line at 40-odd mph. He has long proved himself a master racer with his sharp bike skills and that explosive turn of pace. But Cavendish has a sharp mind, too.

It makes interviewing him something of a contest but an experience that is utterly fascinating. When he talks about the support he provides our injured servicemen and women as a patron for Help for Heroes, there is genuine emotion.

He takes a swipe at ‘the government’ for not doing enough for these ‘amazing people’. He can relate to the ‘team mentality’ that develops among soldiers. ‘It’s more than a job,’ he says. ‘It’s a family. As a sportsman I get that.’

There are moments when he displays the intensity of a Roy Keane, occasionally communicating his objection to a question by simply staring back at you. But here’s a sportsman who is also not afraid to express an opinion and by the end of our chat he has shared quite a few.

Cavendish left Team Sky because he thought the focus was on Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome

‘People think I’m past it,’ he says, unprompted. At 29, is he? ‘No,’ he says. There is a pause. He has clearly decided he has nothing further to say on the subject even if it is one that irks him.

But I ask if it’s something he can prove to himself with facts and figures. Cycling is pretty scientific these days, after all.

‘I measure it by wins,’ he says. ‘I had 11 wins last year, which is more than any other British rider. But because I ride for a team that’s not supported by a media giant I don’t really get the coverage other riders enjoy.’

He is having a dig at Team Sky here, the ‘British’ team he represented for a year but left when he realised the focus was more on Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome and winning the grand tours than on delivering him to the front of the peloton to win stages.

As the finest pure bike racer in the world at that time — he was the Manx Missile L’Equipe had voted the greatest sprinter in the history of the Tour de France — his frustration was understandable.

But the truth is last year was not as successful as previous seasons. At least not in the eyes of cycling fans who measure Cavendish by his grand tour stage victories. He crashed out of the Tour de France in that opening-day sprint into Harrogate and appeared to have been superseded by the giant German, Marcel Kittel, as the main man in a tarmac tear-up.

The 29-year-old believes he will reach his peak during his 30s and is confident he is now at the right team 

A significantly larger man than Cavendish — 6ft 2in plays 5ft 9in — Kittel is a powerhouse. But Cavendish makes the point that his best is yet to come because ‘sprinters often peak in their 30s’ and also says ‘it’s not simply about pure power’.

‘It’s not as scientific as you think,’ he says. ‘I know what weight I have to be.’ Which is what? ‘I know what weight I have to be.’

So he’s pretty confident he’s not past his best? ‘Yeah, I’m pretty confident I’m not past my best,’ he says, repeating the question virtually word for word.

I mention his startling victories on the Champs Elysees in 2009 and 2010 — the first two of four successive wins in the final stage of the Tour — and ask him if he remains the same bike racer.

‘I don’t compare myself to then,’ he says. ‘But I’ve won six races by the end of February.’

It’s as simple as that? ‘It’s as simple as the fact that when I first came in, people looked at when I won,’ he says. ‘I’ve won so much now they only report when I lose.’

His take on Kittel is fascinating. He doesn’t refer to him by name and regards it more as a rivalry between teams than individuals.

Cavendish, pictured during a race in Lido di Camaiore, has had a successful start to 2015 

‘My team has had a rival,’ he says. ‘It has taken us three years (at Etixx-Quick Step) to piece a new team together. But now I’m pretty confident I’ve got the strongest lead-out team. He’s had a team that has been built around him for years. I lost a team that had been built around me, when HTC folded. We didn’t build anything at Sky. And it’s taken two, three years at Quick Step but now I believe we’re there.

‘Last year he (Kittel) only won one more race than me and I was out for half the season. Head to head, he’s probably got the better of me most times. But don’t forget the amount of times I’ve been in the final run-in and he’s already been dropped on a climb.

‘He’s supposed to be the best sprinter in the world, the most powerful rider in a sprint, but that doesn’t mean I’ve lost anything. I win bike races.’

Even after all the he success he has enjoyed, the 43 grand tour stage wins, the world titles, Cavendish insists he remains as hungry as ever. And you can tell he is. You can tell he is miffed that people think there’s now somebody better out there, that he’s not the dominant force he once was. That he’s even now under pressure to secure a new contract when his current deal expires at the end of the season.

‘I still enjoy being the best,’ he says. ‘And I don’t just want to be the best I can be. I want to be the best of everyone. And I have another reason to want to be the best: it’s not just about me any more, it’s about my family and I want to be able to give them a good life.

‘But it’s not just a job. It’s still something I love.

Cavendish is confident dopers will be kicked out of cycling because 'the system is working'

Andre Agassi claimed in his autobiography Open that he did not like tennis despite his success 

‘You know in Andre Agassi’s book, where he says he didn’t like tennis? I’m telling you, he liked tennis. It was the stuff around it he probably got sick of. I understand that. But the core part of it, the thing that I love, is bike racing. I’m not fortunate to be where I am because I made it happen. But I feel lucky to be able to ride my bike for a living.’

He gives his view on the recent drug scandals — it should be pointed out that this interview was conducted before the publication of the CIRC report into the sport’s doping problem — with the same conviction.

‘There are always going to be d***heads,’ he says in reference to the five positives that could result in the Astana team losing its racing licence. ‘There are some guys, if I had a team, I wouldn’t touch. But there’s a lot of innocent people who are going to suffer now.

‘It’s f***ing stupid that there is five in one team. Like, come on, really? You have to have a problem. If you’re doping in cycling I can’t believe how s**t you must be as a cyclist. These guys aren’t even winning. When I started there were dopers. I don’t think it was rife but you could see it. But year on year it’s got better.

‘You still see it. It’s hard to explain. But when you are riding you know how it is to suffer. You know how you breathe, how you look. You can see when something isn’t right. But at least they are being caught. It shows the system is working.’

His final words, though, are for those whose work has been on the battlefield, who have been injured and are now striving to rebuild their lives with the amazing support of Help for Heroes.

‘It is an incredible charity and I find it humbling to be around them,’ he says. ‘These are the people who keep us safe.’
