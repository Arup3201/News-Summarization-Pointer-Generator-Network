She's the size 12 model who has become a byword for feminine curves but Robyn Lawley says she's sick of being classed as 'plus size'.

In an interview with Clique magazine, the 24-year-old Australian spoke of her bemusement that despite being the owner of a toned, healthy body, the fashion industry persists in considering her - and others like her - larger than normal.

'People think plus-size models don't exercise - we do!' she said. 'But it's about health, not forcing my body to be something it's not meant to be.'

Beautiful: 'Plus-size' model Robyn Lawley has spoken out about the lack of 'size diversity' in fashion

6ft 2" Lawley, who has appeared in campaigns for Ralph Lauren and has numerous Vogue covers under her belt, admits she once tried to slim down to satisfy the demands of mainstream modelling, but added that even though she was starving herself, achieving size zero proved impossible.

'Even at my lightest, I just couldn't get there,' she explains. 'I genuinely really tried. I was counting calories, I was taking diet pills, I was dabbling in starvation.'

She adds: 'I thought you had to be skinny to be beautiful. And I thought I would never be beautiful at this size.'

Since giving calorie-counting the boot, Lawley has shot to fame and has followed in the stiletto-clad footsteps of fellow high-profile plus-size models, Crystal Renn and Sophie Dahl - both of whom are as much admired for their curves as they are for their beauty.

Nevertheless, the question of using plus-size models remains fraught in an industry where the average girl is between 5ft 8" and 6ft tall, and wears dress size six.

By contrast, the average plus-size model, although of a similar height to other girls, is a dress size 12 or 14.

Although recently signed by Mango to front their new plus-size range Violetta - which starts at a size 12 - Lawley, who boasts perfect proportions, is irritated that the industry continues to see her and others like her as a niche part of the business.

She also questions why models who fall in the 'no-man's land' between straight size and plus-size continue to be left out, despite having healthy size 10 bodies.

'People say, "How is she a plus-size model?" and I'm like, "Exactly, this is the point, how am I a plus-size model?"

'Fashion designers won't go past a size two [UK size six], so there's no size diversity - just none.

'So there's a whole no-man's land of models who are in between the 'straight size' and the 'plus-size' and they are not working, yet they've got these amazing bodies that are completely in proportion.'

She also revealed that she would like to see the end of the term 'plus-size' altogether, arguing that as she isn't a plus-size person, she shouldn't be considered one.

'I don't think anyone should be called plus-size,' she adds. 'I think it's derogatory to anyone - it's a label.

'I'm a model; I don't think I need 'plus-size' in front of it.'
