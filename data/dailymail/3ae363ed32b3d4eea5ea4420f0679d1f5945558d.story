Having scored 19 goals before injuring his knee against Everton on December 6, Sergio Aguero hasn't looked quite the same player since his comeback, to the obvious detriment of Manchester City's Premier League title hopes.

His work in around the penalty area was sharp enough against Chelsea but the most important bit - putting the ball in the back of the net - eldued him once again.

The Argentine, an unstoppable force before he limped off in tears clutching his knee at The Etihad nearly two months ago, hasn't scored in any of the four games he's played since his return, and he had good chances  to give City a victory their overall performance deserved.

Two passable opportunities, and one extremely good one, fell his way in the first half.

First, he fired at Thibault Courtois when set up by David Silva, then a moment's hesitation allowed Kurt Zouma to produce a saving tackle in the penalty area.

Most damagingly of all, after John Terry slipped, Aguero was allowed to run free to the edge of the area where a slightly hurried finish arced away from Courtois and beyond the far post. It was a chance he would have buried in the autumn.

Those misses seemed particularly costly when Loic Remy converted a flowing Chelsea move from close range to fire the home side ahead after 41 minutes.

But at least Aguero made partial amends by setting up City's equaliser on the stroke of half-time for David Silva, the forward firing a left-foot shot across the six-yard box for Silva to convert after Chelsea goalkeeper Thibauld Courtois had fumbled a punch.

Remy's strike had appeared to justify Jose Mourinho's decision to select him ahead of Didier Drogba to replace the suspended 'stamper' Diego Costa.

But it was City who dominated the rest of the game with Aguero's clever dribbles possessing a threat to John Terry and company in the Chelsea back four.

In the end though, it was Aguero's end product, one of the reasons he was an early contender for Footballer of the Year, that let him down.

If he'd been 100 per cent, Pellegrini would have left him on until final knockings instead of removing him for Edin Dzeko for the final six minutes.

Aguero was good but not the player who scored a stunning hat-trick against Bayern Munich earlier in the campaign.

Even though the title race is never properly won or lost at the end of January, Pellegrini will need the 'old' Aguero back between now and May if City are to have a chance of retaining their title.

Luckily for City, spring is known as the season of new beginnings.
