A married couple have been arrested after apparently pulling a gun on two motorists during a road rage punch-up.

Bradley and Christy Turner were carrying a toddler in the back of their car when they started fighting with a pair of young men in an incident which was caught on camera.

Josh Berry and Nathan Brotzman claim they were acting in self-defence as they knocked Mr Turner to the ground, but he retaliated by waving a gun at them after his wife handed it to him.

The victims tried to escape, but Mr Turner fired in their direction and his bullets hit a nearby home.

The fight in Newport, South Carolina on Sunday afternoon seems to have begun when the young men's Chevrolet truck cut off the Turners' Toyota SUV in a nearby town.

The couple followed the other drivers for 25 miles, the victims claim, before both cars pulled up outside a house in Newport.

While the video footage mostly shows Mr Berry and Mr Brotzman attacking Mr Turner, they insist that he threw the first punch.

'When he walked up, I just looked at him - he said a couple of words, threw a punch, and it was on like Donkey Kong,' Mr Berry told WCTI. 'He assaulted both of us first before we ever landed a hit. It was complete self-defence.'

Punch-up: The Turners had a toddler sitting in their car throughout the fight

After Mr Turner was knocked to the floor, his wife can be seen in the video giving him a handgun, which he brandished at the two motorists.

'She's got the gun, hands it to him and her facial expression is completely calm,' Mr Berry continued. 'Even when he racks the gun, accidentally discharges, her face doesn't even flinch.

'She doesn't even blink. He discharged the weapon and left.'

According to local police, Mr Turner then fired at Mr Berry's truck and hit a nearby house.

They also said that there was a toddler in the couple's car throughout the confrontation, but the child was not hurt in the incident.

Defence: Mrs Turner gave her husband a handgun when the fight was going badly for him

Rampage: The 40-year-old waved the gun at the other men and apparently fired it at their truck

Arrest: The husband and wife have been charged with a variety of assault and weapons charges

Mr Turner, 40, handed himself in to deputies yesterday, and was charged with discharging a weapon into property, counts of assault by pointing a gun, going armed to the terror of the people, injury to personal property, and assault.

His 30-year-old wife was charged with two counts of assault by pointing with a gun.

Mr Berry told WCTI that he and his friend were not responsible for the incident, and insisted that they did no more than they had to stay safe.

'If you're in that predicament, what are you going to do? You don't know,' he said. 'It's the heat of the moment. Your adrenaline is going, you're not going to think right, and we defended ourselves.'
