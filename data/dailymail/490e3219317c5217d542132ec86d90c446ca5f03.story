As far as job titles are concerned, it is perhaps one of the most bizarre.

Cashing in on the hit TV show Game of Thrones, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) is on the lookout for a 'culture and creative vibe manager'.

With scenes from the fantasy drama filmed in Belfast and various locations throughout Northern Ireland, the tourist board is eager to cash in on the hugely popular show.

Game of Thrones is filmed in Belfast, and while much is in studio, the beauty of the Northern Irish landscape is used to full advantage (pictured is the character Robb Stark, played by Richard Madden)

And so the position has been created for someone to guide legions of fans around the filming locations of the mythical land of Westeros.

Speaking to the Royal Television Society, the current head of the 'creative vibe' department Martin Graham said: 'It's great for us - we can associate ourselves to big brands like HBO and Game of Thrones.'

While fans will be eager to visit The Kings Road and Winterfell, Graham will be hoping the new marketing position can educate those as to the real substance of Northern Ireland.

'The show has appealed to the sort of market that wouldn't have come to Northern Ireland or have any knowledge of Northern Ireland from a tourism point of view,' Graham added.

The NITB have already developed a specific programme, called Discover Westeros, that maps out places from the TV show and links their real locations.

Eleven locations are pinned on to a landscape map, that can help avid fans visit their favourite locations from the show.

Game of Thrones has brought a new focus on Northern Ireland that people may not have known about

Dark Hedges in County Antrim are known as King's Road in Game of Thrones, and is one of the most popular photography spots in the country

Importantly, fans will find out that Dragonstone is actually Downhill beach, King's Road is Dark Hedges and Winterfell is Castle Ward. 

The fifth series of Game of Thrones is set to be aired this April, and it is believed the popularity has contributed to around £87 million to the Northern Irish economy.
