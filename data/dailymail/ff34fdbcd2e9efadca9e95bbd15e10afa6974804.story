The wife of a British man who died when the tourist catamaran he was on capsized off Costa Rica,said her husband may not have had time to put on a lifejacket as the ship went down. 

Argentine Stella Hopkins was on board the vessel with husband Ivor, 80, and 97 other holidaymakers and 10 crew when it went down on Thursday morning.

Two other victims have been named as U.S. citizen Edna Oliver, 68 and Canadian Sharon Johnson, 70.

Tears streaming down her face as she recounted their last moments together, Mrs Hopkins said in her native Spanish: 'My husband was Ivor Hopkins who died in the accident.

'The sea was very rough and I said to my husband, "All the times we've been travelling, we've never been on a boat that's moved around so much".

'He said, "Me neither." Those were the last words we spoke to each other.

'After twenty minutes of the boat rocking, they gave us life jackets. I don't know if my husband managed to put one on. Five minutes later the sea rushed in and filled the boat.

'At that point everyone was trying to get out as best they could.'

The catamaran, called Ecoquest, was on a day trip to the popular Tortuga Island when it sank about nine miles from Costa Rica's central Pacific coast.

Some of the survivors, who had paid $190 for a trip that included meals, a DJ, snorkelling and an open bar, spent around two hours in the water before being rescued.

The cause of the accident is still being probed although it has been blamed on strong winds which made sailing conditions difficult.

Authorities said the captain, 36-year-old Tenorio Gutierrez, had passed a breath test.

They also confirmed they were unable to recover the remains of the catamaran from the sea bed nearly 500ft down.

Firefighters' chief Hector Chaves said: 'To reach the vessel we'd need a submarine which we don't have at our disposal.' 

Safe: Passengers from the downed boat gather as they reach the shore. The vessel was carrying more than 100 people at the time

Costa Rican Vice President Ana Helena Chacon identified the dead as a 68-year-old woman from the United States, a Canadian woman aged 70 and an 80-year-old British man. 

Four passengers who had been missing were found and the other 106 people on the boat, survived and were in good health, Chacon added.

According to the public security ministry, 57 passengers were rescued and taken to the beach town of Herradura while 40 others went to the port town of Caldera. 

Survivors said they were handed lifejackets by staff shortly before the boat sank.

One told the BBC: 'We were floating in the ocean. Many people were crying, screaming, asking for help,' an unidentified woman told local television.

Todd Olson, a tourist from Kansas, told the station: 'The captain started to turn the wheel to the left. There were pretty heavy seas and we started to take water on, apparently on the right side.

'Within a minute it was flipped. Very fast, shocking.'

Some 2.4 million foreign tourists - most of them from the US - visited the country in 2013, according to Costa Rica's Tourism Board and it is deemed as one of the safest destinations for tourists in Latin America.

Concerned: Tourists stand in groups at the Coast Guard station in Caldera, Puntarenas

Transport: A man wearing his swimming trunks is led to the bus taking passengers back to their accommodation 

Reaction: One of the survivors speaks to the waiting media as she prepares to board a bus to her hotel 

Guiding: A woman holds another survivor's hand as she steps onto the bus. Authorities are still unsure as to what caused the deadly accident 

Emergency response: Costa Rican police and paramedics await the arrival of tourists who were rescued

Support: A woman  carrying a water bottle is helped onto the waiting vehicle by police 

Devastated: One of the passenger puts her head in her heads as she waits to go back to hotel 

A British Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident on a boat off the coast of Costa Rica involving British nationals.

'We are in close contact with the local authorities and are providing consular assistance.'

Firefighters Corps director Hector Chavez said initial reports of an explosion and fire were mistaken.

Private boats in the area took in passengers until rescuers arrived.

Tour operator Pura Vida Princess reported the 100ft catamaran left Marina Los Suenos. They were going on a day trip to the popular Tortuga (Turtle) Island.

The public security ministry posted news of the deaths on Twitter.

Vice President Ana Helena Chacon said at a news conference: 'We want to extend our condolences to the victims' families,' Ms Chacon said. 

According to the Pura Vida Princess website, the Tortuga Island day trip costs 125 US dollars (£83) and includes meals, a DJ, snorkelling and open bar.
