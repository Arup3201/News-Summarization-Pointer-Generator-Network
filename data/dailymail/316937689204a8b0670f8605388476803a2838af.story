Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Monday morning that it's a mistake to classify a recent beheading murder in Moore, Oklahoma as a case of workplace violence, since the alleged perpetrator was a radical Muslim who reportedly shouted Islamist slogans as he wielded his blade. 

'At some point in time,' Perry said on the Fox News Channel, 'I think the [Obama] administration does have to address this as what it appears to many people that it is: an act of violence that is associated with terrorism.'

But according to The Washington Post, the FBI has stuck the 'workplace violence' label on the case of Alton Nolen, a 30-year-old recent Muslim convert who police say decapitated one coworker and stabbed another shortly after he was fired from his job at a food processing plant.

Alton Nolen, the beheading suspect, is a recent Muslim convert with a long rap sheet who had already served at least two years in prison

His dismissal reportedly followed an argument among employees over whether strict followers of Islam are correct in calling for the stoning deaths of women who commit certain offenses.

'I think Americans aren't confused about this what this is,' Perry told the 'Fox and Friends' program.

'This is a clear case of an individual going in and doing something that doesn't meet their definition of workplace violence.'

'So you know,' Perry said, 'I think any rational thinking American is going to look at this and go, "This is more than just normal workplace violence".'

The federal government still classifies the 2009 Fort Hood shooting in Texas as workplace violence as well.

Critics have slammed authorities in Oklahoma for treating the beheading as 'workplace violence' rather than an act of terrorism. 

The Facebook page of suspect Alton Nolen has anti-American rants under the name 'Jah'Keem Israel' and he has also posted photos of Osama Bin Laden.

It also shows a man with a quote: 'I will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers: smile ye above their necks and smite all their fingertips off them.' 

Police, however, are still classifying it as a 'workplace violence' incident.

Colin Clarke, a Rand Corporation terrorism expert, told Fox & Friends Weekend on Saturday that the beheading was an act of terrorism and should be characterized that way.

'Calling it workplace violence is counterproductive,' he said.

Chad Sweet, CEO of the Chertoff Group and a former Homeland Security Chief of Staff and CIA official, said: 'You'll see this change very shortly.'

'The only thing that is causing a pause, I think, is the fact that the triggering event was the termination of his employment.'

Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, a psychiatrist who had the words 'Soldier of Allah' added to his official military business cards, killed 13 and injured 32 when he opened fire on his fellow servicemen and women. 

Last month Hasan wrote from his jail cell to the self-declared 'caliph' of ISIS, the terrorist Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, asking to be granted citizenship.

In 2013 he told a judge that he planned to defend himself at trial by arguing that he was acting 'in defense of others' with his killings.  

Asked who he was defending, Hasan told a judge it was the leadership of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the Taliban and its leader Mullah Omar – since the Fort Hood troops were expected to deploy to Afghanistan soon after Hasan went on his murder spree.

Hasan was convicted on 13 premeditated murder charges and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder, and sentenced to death.

Survivors of his attack have been denied Purple Heart Medals and other combat benefits because the government refuses to reclassify the shootings as terror-related.

Nolen has served  prison sentences before, with concurrent two-year stays for marijuana possession, assaulting a highway patrol trooper,and cocaine possession. He was released years early following the recalculation of his sentence for good behavior behind bars.

His mother released a Facebook video on Saturday in which she apologized to her son's victims but cautioned that  'there are two sides to every story.'

Flags and crosses honored those killed and wounded in the 2009 'workplace violence' rampage of Maj. Hasan, whose business card read 'Soldier of Allah'

Emotional: Employees and friends waited for word about loved ones as police investigated the beheading on Thursday

'My heart is just so heavy right now,' Joyce Nolen said in the video. 'That's not my son.'

It emerged Monday that Mr. Nolen's beheading victim, 54-year-old Colleen Hufford, was a grandmother who had lost her home in a tornado.

He was shot during his rampage  by a sheriff's deputy who also owned the food processing plant where he worked.

But he regained consciousness by Saturday and law enforcement officers weer able to question him.

Police Sgt. Jeremy Lewis said Nolen will be charged Monday with first-degree murder, and with assault and battery with a deadly weapon. 

He may also face federal charges.
