A second 
long-suffering Comcast customer in two days has taken to YouTube to 
voice his frustrations with the cable company’s apparently terrible 
customer service.

Aaron
 Spain, from Illinois, claims he was kept on hold for three-and-a-half hours when he 
called on Monday evening and attempted to cancel his service.

In
 the end, Spain had to call again the next day after he realized his 
epic wait had been in vain and the customer service department had 
closed for the evening.

'I'm pissed': Aaron Spain claims he was kept on hold for three-and-a-half hours when he called on Monday evening and attempted to cancel his service

In the video clip, Spain can be seen using a second phone to call the Comcast customer service number.

After
 getting through various menu to reach the cancellation option, an 
automated voice states that they are closed for the day. Spain's other 
phone shows he had been on hold for three hours and 25 minutes at that point.

'That’s how long I’ve been on hold and they’re closed. I’m pissed,' he said in to camera.

Spain claims he has spent nearly a month to get 
his Comcast service set up correctly at his apartment to no avail. He told Reddit that he decided to keep holding for hours because he was tired of the 
company’s 'poor customer service.'

'I will simply never use 
their services again. Honestly I don’t know why I stayed with them for 
the 3+ years I had been with them other than poor research on my part,' 
Spain wrote.

'To
 their credit, apart from the hold fiasco (of which I fully realize I’m 
not the first or last to have this happened to) the phone support were 
polite, courteous, and helpful to the extent they are allowed to be.

'It
 was the repeated failure of dispatched technicians that did it in for 
me. I work in the tech industry so I get how it is to be yelled at all 
day by people that just want to be helped. I don’t like to treat anyone 
that way, especially at a call center which is so easily dehumanized.'

Spain was finally able to cancel his service on Tuesday after calling up and achieving his aim within 15 minutes.

'Felt
 bad for the guy I talked to as I gave him little opportunity to offer 
me any other resolution,' Spain posted on Reddit. 'I did clarify it 
wasn’t his fault, I wasn’t mad at him directly, and complimented him on 
doing what I asked and doing his job well.'

A Comcast customer, calling himself 'Tim Davis', grew so frustrated with the poor service he received that he recorded his calls with the cable company and used them to prove that they lied to him about charges

Spain's YouTube video has already been viewed over one million times, which is more than his fellow Comcast complainer, who called himself 'Tim Davis' online.

He grew so frustrated with ISP's poor service that he recorded his calls with the cable company and used them to prove that they lied to him about charges.

He posted his exchanges on YouTube on Sunday and it has received over 700,000 views since.

Davis claims the company only refunded him $182 in unnecessary charges after he played them his recording of the exchanges.

The incident came about after Tim moved to a new apartment in Eugene, Oregon, a month ago and installed his modem and set up his Wi-Fi himself.

The problem started when Tim checked his next bill and found that he had been charged $132 for failing to install his modem properly. Something which had never been an issue

Not long after, his internet connection began to stop working for 5 to 10 minutes at a time and so he called Comcast to complain.

Together, Tim and the representative figured out that the problem was caused by the cable outside of the apartment and that it wasn't his fault. 

Based on his previous experience with the cable company, Tim asked the representative to confirm wouldn't be charged for the repair. This assurance was captured on tape.

A Comcast technician then visited the building where Tim lives and fixed the problem.

The problem started when Tim checked his 
next bill and found that he had been charged $132 for failing to install
 his modem properly. Something which had never been an issue.

On top of that, Tim was also he was charged another $50 for having Comcast set up his Wi-Fi network - again something that Tim had already done himself.

When he called Comcast to query the charges, Tim was put on hold for an hour before he hung up.

Eventually he spoke with a rep called Daisy who informed him that Comcast had subtracted $100 from his bill for 'service discounts.'

Despite his bill being more than halved, Tim said he was still unhappy about the charges.

Next, he was offered an upgrade to a faster internet service. The offer was worth less than the $82 that Comcast was still asking Tim to pay and so he said no.

Next, Daisy told him that there was simply no way she could remove the charges or reimburse his account.

Taking the blame: An internal memo from Comcast COO Dave Watson blames the company for training customer service reps in potentially annoying tactics

Tim then revealed that he had a recording of a phone call in which Comcast told him he wouldn't be charged.

Finally, Comcast backed down and gave him back his money.

'Why were you not able to do that before?' Tim asked.

'Again, 
that is a valid charge,' Daisy said. 'But since I advised my manager 
that there is a recording, and you were misinformed, then he's the one 
who can approve that $82.'

'You're telling me that if I didn't have a recording of that call, you wouldn't have been able to do it,' he said. 'That is correct, yes.'

Tim, who works as a senior IT analyst for a large company, posted about his experience with Comcast on Reddit and received a deluge of people with similar experiences.

Last
 month, Comcast made headlines after another customer recorded and 
published a phone call with customer service. In that call, a Comcast 
rep refused to let a couple cancel their service when they wanted to 
switch cable and Internet providers.

A
 leaked memo reveals that high-ranking executives at Comcast admit the 
excruciating customer service call that recently went viral was mostly 
their fault.

The company's chief operating officer Dave Watson says in his memo that the nagging, begging and condescending endured for 18 minutes by Ryan Block was part of what Comcast paid and trained the employee to do.

'It was painful to listen to this call, and I am not surprised that we have been criticized for it,' Watson says in the document first leaked to Consumerist.

The memo 
surfaced just a week after the call to Engadget founder Ryan Block - who 
recorded it and put it on Soundcloud, where it's now been played over 5 
million times - went viral.

'We
 are embarrassed by the tone of the call and the lack of sensitivity to 
the customer’s desire to discontinue service,' Watson wrote.

Comcast is currently seeking regulatory 
approval to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, a deal that would 
make the largest cable company in the world even bigger.

Critics of the 
deal argue that a telecom so large would have even less reason to offer 
decent customer service.
