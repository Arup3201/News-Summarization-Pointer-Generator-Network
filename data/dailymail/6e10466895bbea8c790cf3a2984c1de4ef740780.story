Business minister Lord Marland has decided to step down after becoming frustrated with the grind of Whitehall

David Cameron suffered a fresh setback last night when he lost his second minister in as many days.

Tory business minister Lord Marland – the Prime Minister’s personal trade envoy – told Mr Cameron of his decision to quit at lunchtime on Tuesday

He will, however, continue in his envoy role.

Lord Marland, 56, said he wanted to leave his main role because he was frustrated with the daily grind of Whitehall and wants to concentrate on the trade role for which he thinks he is more suited.

He also wants more time to concentrate on his business career.

His surprise decision emerged after Lord Strathclyde resigned as Leader of the House of Lords on Monday, the day of the Coalition relaunch.

Lord Strathclyde blamed the irritations of working with the Liberal Democrats for his decision to quit.

But the disclosure that a second minister is leaving because he does not enjoy government will raise fresh questions about the true state of relations between the Tories and Lib Dems.

Labour made hay with the announcement, declaring it a case of ‘two Lords a leaping’.  Lord Marland is a highly influential figure in Conservative circles, having served as Tory Party treasurer, and has been a key link man to wealthy donors whose support Mr Cameron will need to fill his election war chest.

Mr Cameron made him a central player in his bid to focus both foreign and economic policy on the need to drum up business around the world.

Lord Marland was in charge of intellectual property issues and was responsible for piloting the Government’s Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill through the Lords – a process which is not yet complete.

He has also enjoyed a long career in the City. A founding director of insurance multi-national Jardine Lloyd Thompson, he also led the acquisition of Hunter Boots, which saved the company from closure.

Lord Marland, who lives in the grade-II* listed Odstock Manor, Wiltshire, stood as a Tory Parliamentary candidate in 2001 but lost to Lib Dem David Heath in the Somerton and Frome seat before serving as Tory treasurer between 2003 and 2007.

David Cameron has seen two peers step down in the space of two days following Lord Marland's decision

The father of four was made a life peer in 2006 and was treasurer for Boris Johnson’s successful campaign for London mayor in 2008.

In May 2011 he was appointed as the chairman of the British Business Ambassadors by UK Trade & Investment, the branch of government which fights to win deals overseas.

Lord Strathclyde resigned as Leader of the House of Lords on Monday, blaming the frustrations of working with the Liberal Democrats

He is understood to have several overseas trips planned to bring in business which he hopes will return the economy to robust growth.

Lord Marland told Mr Cameron of his decision yesterday lunchtime.

One friend said: ‘He wants to do what he is good at, which is drumming up trade. You get growth by doing deals, not piloting Bills through the House of Lords.’

A senior Government source told the Mail: ‘He has been frustrated by the day-to-day business of government. He also wants to get back to the private sector and there isn’t the time to do that and perform all the duties of a minister at the same time.’

Another source said: ‘He wants  to go and pursue his business interests. He felt that the things he wanted to do in business he couldn’t do as a minister.’

Lord Marland’s decision ‘came as a surprise’ to Mr Cameron, insiders said.

The loss of two well-connected grandees will be keenly felt in Downing Street, where aides valued Lord Strathclyde’s political judgment and Lord Marland’s understanding of the business community.
