England’s doomed campaign to host the 2018 World Cup is expected to feature far more prominently than the FA would like in Michael Garcia’s report into the corrupt bidding process.

The England bid was arguably the most transparent of all those involved in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup elections on which FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert has promised to deliver his verdict next month.

But despite the multi-millions allegedly spent by Qatar on winning the 2022 vote, the fear inside Wembley is that England will still be rapped for relatively insignificant breaches of bidding regulations.

Garcia wanted extra answers from the FA about four incidents — the £230 Mulberry handbags given as gifts to FIFA executive committee members during a visit to London, the £35,000 sponsorship of a Caribbean Football Union summit, former ExCo member Chuck Blazer’s tour of venues and an FA party at the Saxon Hotel in Johannesburg during the 2010 World Cup.

The one certainty about the coincidental departures of FA general secretary Alex Horne and Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay within 24 hours is that they won’t be swapping jobs. Gourlay, an unpopular figure at Stamford Bridge, did well to survive five years in that hot seat, but had become increasingly marginalised by busy chairman Bruce Buck and owner Roman Abramovich’s special advisor Marina Granovskaia.

Manchester City’s £180-a-head corporate package for the game at West Ham on Saturday includes a talk from Ed Sulley, City’s head of research and innovation, on the performance strategies keeping the club at the ‘forefront of the game’… although not necessarily in the group stages of the Champions League.

The FA are in talks with former FA Cup sponsors Budweiser about a reduced second tier endorsement. But with the first round fast approaching and no new sponsorship deal in place, it would be a bonus if the American lager brand did another year as the main Cup sponsor to bail out Wembley from embarrassment.

Shame about Boat Race

Ascot and headhunters Spencer Stuart spent a difficult year trying to find a new chief executive from outside racing who has experience of running a major venue. So it’s highly surprising that the eventual choice is Guy Henderson, 56, a former litigation lawyer with international firm Allen & Overy and chairman of Wincanton races for the last two years. 

Ascot will be hoping Henderson steers them on a better course than he took on the River Thames during the 1978 Boat Race when cox of the Cambridge boat that sank in choppy waters. Not that the famous occasion features anywhere on the official Ascot announcement of Henderson’s appointment.

Troubled sports agency Kentaro have gone into administration in the UK following a number of bankruptcy orders in Switzerland. Newcastle and West Ham are among numerous clubs and football federations owed money having taken part in a Kentaro-organised tournament at Schalke. 

Kentaro, who specialised in selling TV contracts across Europe, have never recovered from UEFA’s decision to centralise their Euro and World Cup qualifying rights.

The price of renovating the Olympic Stadium for tenants West Ham rose by a whopping £35.9m on Wednesday — an additional payment agreed with constructors Balfour Beatty that an admirably transparent London Legacy Development Corporation will meet from contingency funds. 

Installing the largest single span cantilever roof in the world has proved far more complex and expensive than envisaged when the £154m building contract was signed.

Minister of Sport Helen Grant’s big plan before the next election is a consumer and social media campaign via Twitter, Facebook and other outlets to encourage more female participation in sport. The cost of the initiative is said to be around £10m to be paid for by lottery funding, with Sport England organising this highly expensive project. 

No wonder Sport England chairman Nick Bitel’s working lunches with sports governing body chiefs to discuss the plan have had a budget-conscious menu of sandwiches, crisps and a vegetable samosa … if you’re lucky.
