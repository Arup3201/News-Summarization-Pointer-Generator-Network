As a fourth night of violence is feared across London tonight, several governments have begun dispensing advice to those thinking about travelling the UK

The United States, Germany, Latvia, Sweden, Denmark and Finland have all urged tourists to be vigilant, keep checking the media for updates and ensure they are insured.

On the U.S. Embassy website, travellers are warned to avoid any civil unrest they may see on the streets, and not to engage anyone seen causing a disturbance.

Burning down: Several foreign governments have started issuing advice to their citizens thinking about visiting the UK

•    Follow local media reports and be aware of what is going on around you;

•    If you find yourself near any civil unrest, leave;

•    If you see trouble move away from the scene;

•    Don’t engage with those causing disturbance;

•    Do not challenge debate or make unwise comments.  This will only increase your chance of becoming a victim of violence;

•    If you find yourself in trouble and it is an emergency call the police first, only then, if necessary, reach out to the Embassy

Latvia became the first country earlier today to advise its citizens to avoid visiting parts of Britain hit by riots.

Its Foreign Ministry in Riga also urged all travellers to Britain to ensure they have health and life insurance policies.

Sweden,
Denmark and Finland quickly followed its lead by issuing safety advice 
to stay vigilant and keep an eye on local media and British websites for
safety updates.

The Finnish Embassy warned that moving from one place to another in problem areas can be 'extremely difficult'.

The German foreign ministry also issued travel advice by warning its citizens to exercise 'special caution' in the wake of the troubles.

It told travellers to immediately 'pull back' if confronted with any signs of disturbance, and to especially follow advice given by security forces.

Its travel advisory stated: 'Travellers should also look to the media to keep themselves informed about the latest developments and act in an appropriate fashion locally.'

In India, the editor of the country's Lonely Planet magazine told his Twitter followers to avoid coming to the UK at all.

Vardhan Kondvikar said: 'Violence has now spread to Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester and Liverpool.

'Try not to travel to the UK this week if possible.'

Foreign newspapers have splashed images of burnt out cars, looters and embattled police on their front pages.

Journalists from near and far have been following the riots, in particular the German media which has highlighted the fact that London is just one year away from hosting the Olympics.

'London burns - but the fears are concentrated on the Olympics instead of de-escalation,' said Sueedeutsche Zeitung.

'Chaos reigns in London!' added de Bild, while a commentator on Bavaria Radio said: 'It will be hard to sell London as a civilised upholder of Olympic values and spirit while the buildings burn brighter than the Olympic torch and the stone-throwers beat out the discus and javelin competitors with ease.'

The TZ newspaper in Munich added: 'What has gone wrong with Britain? Like the Sex Pistols said, it truly is anarchy in the UK. Now the fight is on to find the solution - and fast.'

The reaction from the U.S. has been mixed, but broadly in favour of a tougher response.

On arts and culture website The Atlantic, David Blum wrote: 'They enacted a slash spending program nine months ago, it destroyed growth, and people are rioting. There's no surprise here. You destroy the economy and bad things happens.'

But elsewhere, commenting on the Wall Street Journal website, Steven Hoskins was not so sympathetic and wrote: 'They riot because they are criminals. No excuses accepted.

'These people are welcome to march and protest, but when they start robbing and destroying other's property, then I'm all for declaring them targets for target practice.'

Another poster on the Washington Post website added: 'Send in the military with orders to shoot all looters. That will end the riots fairly quickly....'
