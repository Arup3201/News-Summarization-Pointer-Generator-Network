A woman who awoke in the middle of the night to find her five-year-old daughter being kidnapped by a stranger has revealed 'woman's intuition' made her know something was wrong.

Stephanie Holladay Edson and her husband Aaron Edson woke early on Friday morning to find their daughter Lainey being carried across the front yard of their home in Sandy, Utah - allegedly by Troy Morley, 48.

After a calm interaction between Aaron Edson and Morley, the little girl was handed back to her family unharmed. Morley was later found inside a neighbor's home and arrested.

Speaking exclusively to Good Morning America on Monday, Mr Edson, 37, revealed that there were no noises in the home that woke them up - and instead thanked his wife's 'woman's intuition'.

Thankful: Stephanie and Aaron Holladay Edson spoke with GMA on Monday about the terrifying moment they found their five-year-old daughter had been snatched from their home in the middle of the night

'We were asleep and I woke up - not to a noise,' she explained. 'Nothing woke me up. I looked at my cell phone - it was 4.07. I remember thinking, "I'm not tired, I'm awake, this is weird".'

'I was fully mentally alert and because I was awake, I was able to hear the things that... saved my daughter.'

She said that she heard a dull thud and her daughter's voice, but could not hear her daughter walking. The girl has a minor physical handicap that gives her a recognizable gait pattern, she said. 

'There was no footsteps,' her mother, 32, said. 'There was her voice without her footsteps... I knew something was wrong.'

At that point, she woke up her husband, yelling: 'She's outside! She's outside!'

Mr Edson jumped from the bed and the couple found their daughter's door open, her light on and her bed empty. He ran outside.

Emotional: Stephanie said that she awoke at 4am and immediately knew that something was wrong

Heroic: Aaron ran outside and asked the kidnapper what he was doing, before calmly convincing him to hand the little girl back over. He said no one raised their voices and that the handover was peaceful

'I was just looking for Lainey,' Mr Edson explained. 'I wanted to get her back in a way that was not upsetting to her.'

He called out gently and then he saw the man carrying his step-daughter - who was still holding on to a story book - away from the home.

'What are you doing?' he asked. 

Morley explained to the father that he was in trouble and 'if he had her with him then they wouldn't kill him,' Edson recounted.

Mr Edson said that he wanted to help but that he couldn't take the girl with him. The man handed over the little girl without any trouble, he said. 

'Just peacefully and calmly and nobody's voice ever got raised,' he said. 

The couple said their daughter was smiling and was even excited that she would get to stay up until the morning.

Saved: The five-year-old girl is carried to the family's home on Friday, hours after the ordeal

They called 911 and alerted police, who found Morley inside a neighbor's home.

'It came so close to being something horrible,' Mr Edson said. It was 'a very close call... If it has to happen, if this is the way it has to end, it's just perfect.' 

The five-year-old girl wasn't hurt in the frightening experience, but the incident has evoked haunting echoes of when 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart was snatched out of her Salt Lake City bedroom in 2002. She was held captive for nine months before being found. 

The abduction attempt was not targeted, but a random incident, said Sandy Police Sgt. Dean Carriger. The family said they don't know Morley.

The intruder was in the family's basement searching through things when he came upon the girl sleeping in her bedroom, Carriger said. Police don't know what his motive was.

Caught: Troy Morley, 46, is seen here being led in the jail after he was released from the hospital on Friday afternoon. He was bitten on the shoulder by a police dog before his arrest

In custody: Police say Morley had been wandering through the neighborhood trying to find open doors and windows to break into a home. He entered the house through an unlocked side door

'It obviously was a very scary, traumatic situation,' Carriger said. 'The sanctity of our home is huge and for somebody to enter that and grab your child, it's got to be one of the worst nightmares a parent could face.  

'If those parents were not awakened to go out and investigate, he could have easily left undetected with the girl.'

After the 911 call, officers set up a perimeter, and with the help of police dogs, launched a search.

The suspect went into a second home two blocks away through a doggy door in an attempt to evade capture. The dogs at that house alerted the residents, who yelled at police already in the area to come get him.

Police captured Morley outside the second home thanks to a police dog that bit the suspect in the upper shoulder, Carriger said.

He was arrested and booked on charges of child kidnapping, burglary, trespassing and resisting arrest.

Morley isn't on Utah's sex offender registry and online court records only show a pair of divorces and DUI charges.

Family spokesman Miles Holman called it a miracle that the parents woke up in time.

'Thirty seconds later and it would have been all over,' Holman said. 'He would have been long gone.' 

The family's backyard butts up against a canal that separates the neighborhood from a bustling shopping center in the heart of Sandy, a city of 90,000 people that, like most parts of Utah, is predominantly Mormon.

'Things like that just don't happen around here,' said Melissa Johnson, 26, who is staying in her parents' house that is next to the home where the abduction event occurred.

She said her younger sibling heard screams and commotion in the early morning and came to sleep with her downstairs. Johnson said they attend the same Mormon congregation as the family.

'I've been thinking that the Heavenly Father had a hand it,' Johnson said. 'He was protecting them. . . I just hope it won't be traumatizing for the little girl.'

Johnson and other neighbors say it's a scary thought that a man capable of snatching a child was roaming their neighborhood in the night.

April Parry, a mother of three children who lives down the street, said she and her husband are considering an alarm system.

'That is your biggest fear as a parent,' Parry said. 'It can happen anytime, that's what makes it scary.'

About 45 miles north in Roy, where Morley lived, neighbors said they weren't the least bit surprised to find out the man known as a super creep had been accused of trying to abduct a girl.

Next-door neighbor Andrea Shearer, 33, said she forbid her children to interact with Morley after a series of bizarre and inappropriate conversations. Shearer said Morley had been caught sneaking into backyards, including hers. She obtained a no trespass order on him from police.

She said she believes Morley had a meth addiction. He talked about a satanic cult causing his wife to leave him and having critters crawling through the attic, she said.

'He scared me. I'm so glad he's gone,' said Shearer, a health care professional. 'You always hear people saying about their neighbor that they seemed so quiet and normal. Not him, I'm not surprised.'
