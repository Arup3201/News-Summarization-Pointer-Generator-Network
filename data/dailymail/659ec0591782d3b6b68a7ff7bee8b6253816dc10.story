Thousands of strays, of both the homeless canine and working feline variety, were rounded up and cleared off the streets of Rio as part of the pre-World Cup clean up.

There must have been at least a couple of four-legged survivors.

Because England have made two dog’s dinners of Brazil 2014.

One on the pitch, the other off it.

Dog's dinner: Roy Hodgson guided England to an early exit after losing their opening two games

To end up playing a match which was surplus to little Costa Rica’s requirements – but a dead-dog rubber for England - before slinking back home is more humiliating than it has ever been for football’s mother country.

To inflict a goalless draw of such numbing indifference on so brilliant a World Cup carnival was tantamount to an act of vandalism.

But not as wretched as to indulge in self-aggrandising, show-boat insulting of FIFA and its president in public, which was not only embarrassing but moronic.

Whatever Roy Hodgson and his team got wrong in what turned out to be not so much a group of slow death as one of rapid suicide, those deficiencies pale in comparison with the damage self-inflicted on our national game by chairman Greg Dyke and his FA gang of fools.

There are times when Hodgson is too open and honest for his own good – although bless him for that – but when it comes to putting boot in mouth Dyke is in a class all his own.

Debacle: England are heading home early from the World Cup after losing to Italy and Uruguay

Hodgson is endlessly courteous and charming when trying to explain the thinking behind decisions for which he is criticised. It probably wasn’t a great idea to declare, after the debacle in Brazil, that he will need six more years to get England up to World Cup speed.

Even US presidents only ask for four more.

But he is telling it as he sees it, not for effect nor to excuse in advance what may well go wrong in the next couple of tournaments. England’s manager is simply trying to focus the FA and the Premier League on the scale of the task and the revolution which needs to take place.

Since World Cups are voyages of discovery, Hodgson is speaking from what he has learned here.

It was a mistake to bring too many young players. Albeit one made in the desperate knowledge that the long-established members of the squad had failed too often, losing the faith of the English public while doing so.

Mistakes: Hodgson will have to go back to the drawing board ahead of the European Championship qualifiers

Two or three boys of exceptional promise – Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley, Daniel Sturridge – were enough.

Tactically there was an old-fashioned look about England. The world game evolves constantly and we saw little or nothing from Roy’s Boys of the dynamic pressing and quick, clever angled passing made possible by sharp movement which are fundamental to the best teams in this competition.

That is by no means all the fault of this manager. The Premier League is more about box-office thrills and spills than technique and intelligence, while not enough English players are benefitting from the experience of the Champions League.

Even so Hodgson will shoulder his share of the blame for a showing even more dismal than England’s only previous failure to qualify from the group stage.

Promising signs: Ross Barkley was one a few England players to make an impression

So must the likes of Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka, Joe Hart, Jordan Henderson and Danny Welbeck.

At least in 1958 England forced three draws and returned home undefeated. Two strikes and out before this mostly meaningless exercise in Belo Horizonte of giving the back- up chaps consolation World Cup caps is nothing less than humiliation.

Frankly, it is no wonder that the folks back home wonder how some of these players can be paid so much yet do so little for the country.

The wretchedness of their efforts has become clearer with a realisation that Italy and Uruguay are no better than average teams.

Shouldering the blame: The likes of Rooney, Baines and Jagielka must take responsibility

Yes, part of the answer lies in improving the identifying of the best young talent and educating those boys properly in the finer arts of football. This is the primary responsibility of the FA.

Dyke pays lip service to that duty, while just grandstanding on the world stage.

England were like a dog chasings its own tail. Even worse, the FA were barking up all the wrong trees.

Dyke should have been campaigning for the introduction of international regulations which would force the self-interested Premier League to limit the number of foreigners at our major clubs and thereby develop world class footballers of English birth-right.

He should have been working quietly behind the scenes to heal the rift between England and the governing body of the world game so that we might rebuild the respect and influence we once had and, hopefully, bring football home again.

Dog's dinner: Greg Dyke's tenure has been nothing sure of a disaster so far

But oh no. Not our Mr Dyke.

Up he jumped in front of the whole congress to demand the head of Sepp Blatter over a corruption issue for which he is not culpable - and even as he is presiding over a magical World Cup which will generate billions for the game around the world. There is as much chance of Blatter not being re-elected next year as there ever was of England winning this World Cup.

It’s all in the timing. This is embarrassingly reminiscent of previous FA bigwigs promising to vote for a European candidate against Blatter when he was first elected, then hastily switching when they realised which way the wind was blowing.

Dyke fancied he could position himself as the champion of an anti-Blatter movement. Seemingly he fails to understand that it was this president who expelled Mohammad Bin Hamman, the Qatari accused of 2022 World Cup hosting corruption.

Attack: Dyke hit out at Sepp Blatter on the eve of the tournament

Nor does he grasp that any hostility to Blatter in most of the rest of the world is nothing like as fierce as in insular England and that he has antagonised not only the FIFA high command but  many other countries.

If it really is English football’s ambition never to win or stage the World Cup again, then the FA have gone a long way towards achieving those goals.
