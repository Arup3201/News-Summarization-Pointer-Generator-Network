The twin sister of Michael Rockefeller - who vanished in New Guinea in 1961 - has revealed that she was so devastated by his death that she saw his face in crowds for years afterwards.

Mary Rockefeller Morgan, whose father was the governor of New York at the time her brother went missing, has spoken in depth for the first time about his death and how her wealthy family insisted she must never cry about it, even though she was heartbroken.

The 76-year-old psychologist, who is based in New York and specializes in twin bereavement, also dismissed claims that her brother had been killed and eaten by cannibals and instead said she believes it is more likely that he drowned after he was stranded at sea.

Heartbroken: Mary Rockefeller Morgan has spoken about how devastated she was when her twin brother Michael disappeared in New Guinea when they were 23

'There is no direct or conclusive evidence of how Michael died,' Mary, told People magazine. 'When you don't know how the person died,
 it prolongs the grieving and the healing. There were times in my life 
where I really couldn't function.'

Michael, then 23 and the son off New York Governor and future Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, vanished off the coast of New Guinea on November 19, 1961.

He was in the country as part of an anthropological expedition to collect art from the Asmat tribe, a remote group of people who welcomed and fascinated him, his sister said.

Before he traveled there, Mary said she had a 'premonition' that he would not return.

'But there was no dissuading Michael,' she said. 'He was completely thrilled about what he was doing.'

Mystery: Michael, 23, is pictured in New Guinea the year before he vanished. He was there studying tribe communities and their art when he vanished as he tried to swim to shore from a stranded boat

But in November 1961, he was aboard a catamaran with his companion and fellow researcher Rene Wassing when the vessel was swept out to sea.

After 
failing to paddle towards the shore and running out of food and water, 
Michael - the only one of the pair who could swim - realized he had to swim to the shore. But he was never seen again.

While it is largely believed that he failed to reach the shore - which he had estimated would take him about 10 hours - and drowned, others have speculated that he was eaten by the tribe.

In a book, Savage Harvest, published in March, journalist Carl Hoffman wrote that extensive research had led him to believe that members of the Asmat tribe had found Michael swimming and killed him.

Hoffman wrote that Michael was tortured, beheaded and eaten in a ritualistic cannibal killing by the tribe as revenge for the murder of five of their own by a Dutchman overseeing the colony.

But Mary Rockefeller Morgan said she 
thinks it is more likely that he drowned in the massive expanse of sea 
rather than be killed by the people who had showed him such kindness.

She said she still remembers her father bringing her family the news - 'I knew deep down for one terrible moment that Michael was gone' - before they flew to New Guinea that night.

Devastated: Mary has written about her grief in a book, which shows her and her brother

'We were incredibly moved by the amount of people who came out over this vast expanse of jungle from their small villages and went to search for him,' she said.

'The prevailing thought was that he had drowned... In a seaplane over the dense jungle coastline, I realized how unbelievably difficult it was to make it to shore.'

After ten days, the family called off the search and Mary returned home, where she hugged her mother, who told her never to cry. She saw this as part of her 'responsibility' as a Rockefeller.

She buried her emotions and struggled with her grief.

'Nobody knows what happened to Michael, and that leaves our family in a terrible place of not knowing,' she said. I wanted him to be alive so much that sometimes I thought I saw him in a crowd.'

She began speaking with a therapist but admits that it took her nearly 30 years to heal. She said she found her work with grieving twins helped her share her story.

Now she remembers him happily, and regularly visits the art he collected that is on show at the Metropolitan Museum.

'Today he feels so present,' she said. 'He left for me his incredible curiosity and his ability to embrace life... He is bigger than his death. My family and I hold him in our hearts, and we are so proud of his legacy.'
