Missing: Vilet Torrez was last seen at her apartment in Florida on March 31

The ‘jealous’ husband of a missing mother called police to tell them he ‘definitely did it’ before he reported her missing – it has been claimed.

Cid Torrez waited three days to tell police that his wife Vilet Torrez, 38, had disappeared.

Her company car was found in the parking lot of her apartment complex, but 
she failed to go to work and never made contact with relatives.

In a recording released by the Miramar Police Department yesterday a man believed to be Mr Torrez is heard to say: 'I don't know about Saturday, and now Sunday, I definitely did it.'

The couple from, Florida, USA, had dated since high school but the relationship was very volatile and 
Vilet had recently separated from Cid – her husband of 15 years.

On Monday Florida police released 
CCTV footage of Vilet visiting her gated community home on March 31.

Suspected: Police filed a warrant to obtain Cid Torrez's DNA and fingerprints and a judge denied him custody of the couple's three children, pictured

Detectives believe that she must have been let in by someone inside the house who undid the security latch report ABC News.

They have confirmed that Cid Torrez, 38, is a person of interest to the case but say that he is not a suspect.

Richard Della Fera, Torrez’ attorney 
said the statement ‘I definitely did it’ was made at a time when Torrez 
was distressed and attempting to remember the calls he made to Vilet and
her mother which later led to the police call.

Spokewoman for Miramar Police Department said: ‘I think the 911 call speaks for itself.’

Police have called Cid Torrez a 
person of interest but have reiterated Cid Torrez is not a suspect and 
has cooperated with their enquiries.

Family Life: Allegations of abuse within the relationship have since surfaced and police suspect 'foul play'

Cid Torrez waited three days to report Vilet missing and initially appeared in news reports pleading for help to find her

The missing woman's brother, Javier 
Blanco, described Cid Torrez as ‘jealous’ and said he hadn't slept over 
at the couple’s home in months.

Mr Blanco said his brother-in-law was controlling, to the extent they worried about their sister's safety.

He
said that he once saw Mr Torrez get physical with his sister at a car 
dealership over a financial dispute and several times, he lied to new 
acquaintances that she was dead.

The Mail Online has previously reported how General Magistrate Giuseppina Miranda 
ordered that the couple's three children Vilet, 12, Cid Jr., seven, and Marcus, four, stay with 
their mother's family and ordered their father to stop making 
unsupervised contact with them.

Police executed search warrants on 
Vilet Torrez' home and car, as well as her estranged husband's vehicle. 
Cid Torrez has also provided police with hair and saliva samples.

No suspects have been named.
