Adrian Peterson's appeal of his NFL suspension in the wake of a child abuse charge has been denied, the league said Friday.

NFL spokesman Greg Aiello issued a brief statement posted on NFL.com saying an appeals officer appointed by the league to hear the case had affirmed the season-long suspension handed out to Peterson after he pleaded no-contest to a reduced charge to avoid jail time in the severe spanking of his four-year-old son.

Peterson, 29, was suspended by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on November 18, who said the Minnesota running back would not be eligible for reinstatement until April 15.

Nothing to smirk about: Vikings running back Adrian Peterson's (seen here last month) season-long suspension was upheld on Friday by independent arbiter and former NFL executive Harold Henderson 

Form of 'discipline': Peterson disciplined his son using a thin branch last May, leaving severe cuts, welts and bruises on his body. Photos of the boy's injuries (above) were later released by Houston Police Department

The league said Peterson's plea -- for smacking his son with a tree branch so hard that it created cuts, welts and bruises -- put him in violation of its personal conduct policy.

Peterson, the 2012 NFL Most Valuable Player, has played in just one game this year, the Vikings' season-opener.

The NFL Players' Association immediately responded, hinting it would take Peterson's case to court.

'The NFLPA expected this outcome, given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL,' the union said in a statement.

'The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement. This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. Our union is considering immediate legal remedies.'

Arbitrator Harold Henderson said in his ruling that Peterson, the 2012 NFL Most Valuable Player, 'has not demonstrated that the process and procedures surrounding his discipline were not fair and consistent.'

Henderson added that Peterson 'was afforded all the protections and rights to which he is entitled, and I find no basis to vacate or reduce the discipline.'

'The facts in this appeal are uncontested,' Henderson wrote. 'The player entered a plea which effectively admitted guilt to a criminal charge of child abuse, after inflicting serious injuries to his four-year-old son in the course of administering discipline.'

The arbitrator added, 'No direct evidence of the beating was entered in the record here, but numerous court documents, investigative reports, photographs and news reports, all accepted into evidence without objection, make it clear that Mr. Peterson's conduct was egregious and aggravated as those terms are used in the Policy, and merits substantial discipline.'

Henderson is a former NFL executive vice president of labor relations who has heard 87 appeals since 2008 involving personal conduct and drug issues.

Serving his sentence: The Minnesota Vikings running back, who pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault last month, was suspended for the rest of the season for violating the league's personal conduct policy

Peterson, 29, pleaded no contest on November 4 to misdemeanor reckless assault of his 4-year-old son, allowing him to avoid a felony child-abuse conviction.

 After Peterson's plea, Goodell suspended Peterson until at least April 15 for violating the NFL personal conduct policy. 

He was arrested in September on a felony child abuse charge for disciplining his son by repeatedly striking him with a thin tree branch called a switch.
