These riders can’t believe their eyes! They may look rather strange but they are actually testing a new way of experiencing a roller coaster.

With theme parks battling to add evermore twists, turns and loop-the-loops to terrify thrill-seekers, researchers are also testing ways of adding an extra fear-factor.

By wearing an Oculus Rift VR headset, the roller coaster rides present a virtual dimension to the rider and they can fly through space, ride on the backs of dragons and swoop through dangerous terrain. 

It may sound too good to be true but the people behind VR Coaster have already started testing the technology... and based on the comments of the ride testers, the experiment was a resounding success.  

The Augmented Thrill Ride Project is the very first synchronised virtual reality ride on real roller coasters and hundreds of test rides were carried out in Germany's Europa-Park.

For the test, coaster cars are rigged with laptops and cameras, and the wheels fitted with special electronics, setting the scene for a ride testers will never forget.

The testers strap themselves in, psyching themselves for the ride of their lives.

One tester plays the video game whilst the other gets to experience the view ahead, which is enhanced and influenced both by the game and by the movements of his head.

The roller coaster zooms off and almost immediately participants are screaming as the cold wind hits their skin.

But the headset tester is looking around, instead of looking straight ahead like the other joyriders.

At one point he looks up, as if he can see things that the others cannot.

And indeed he can, as he is aware of a completely different view to the rest of the riders.

As the roller coasters swoops, swerves and dives across twisting corners, the headset user is treated to a different sights, sounds and movements.

One test rider is on horseback, riding in a virtual world of tunnels, windmills, and ogres.

As the roller coaster hugs the tracks, curving ever-higher, the tester's virtual horse sprouts wings and evades a monster.

The roller coasters' 360 degree turns are also echoed on the headset and the rider and his horse follow suit.

The scene changes to another user, who is playing a game in space.

As the roller coaster moves, the rider ‘fires’ shots on his console, which, on his headset, translate as bullets from a space gun that decimate space debris, clearing a path for his spaceship.

‘Man, that was cool. This is was amazing, awesome, sensational,’ one tester says in German.

Another tester said the ride was ‘epic’ and ‘better than without headsets’.

‘Awesome, a brilliant idea,’ an enthusiastic tester, who can barely hide her excitement, exclaims. 

The idea a synchronised virtual ride came from Thomas Wagner, a Virtual Design professor at the University of Applied Sciences Kaiserslautern, Germany.
