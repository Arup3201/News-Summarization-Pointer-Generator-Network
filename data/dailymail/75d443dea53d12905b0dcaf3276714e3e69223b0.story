With their petite frames, golden tans and flowing brunette locks, TV stars Michelle Keegan and Louise Thompson could be sisters.

And their uncanny resemblance just became even stronger after the Coronation Street actress was spotted wearing the Made in Chelsea star-turned-designer's clothes at the X Factor wrap party.

Michelle sported the £24 textured peplum top and £29 cigarette trousers from the Louise Thompson for Goddiva collection.

The 25-year-old completed her ‘office to evening’ look with white stilettos and a cosy faux fur coat.

Pint-sized Chelsea girl Louise recently launched her second collection for 
online fashion retailer Goddiva.

The 22-year-old fashion fan, whose love of a pussy bow and
statement jewellery is captured on the E4 reality show, has channeled her distinct
sense of style and love of vintage designs into the latest 
collection, which features a series of eye-catching dresses.

Speaking in an exclusive interview with MailOnline recently the reality TV star said: 'I have always
been really into fashion so this is basically the perfect opportunity 
without me having to do all the really hard work like manufacturing and 
sourcing materials.

'I get to design the clothes which is my idea of 
heaven and then they make them for me so it's the perfect 
collaboration.'
