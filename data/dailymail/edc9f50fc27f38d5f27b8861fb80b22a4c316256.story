Thorgan Hazard is open to remaining at Borussia Monchengladbach beyond his loan spell.

The 21-year-old has impressed while on loan at the Bundesliga side but has yet to play a game for Jose Mourinho's side. 

And Hazard, the brother of Blues playmaker Eden, isn't ruling out a permanent move away from Stamford Bridge.

'It's an option to stay at Gladbach longer. But it's just too early to talk about it now,' he told the Evening Standard. 

'The decision will be made towards the end of the season. I feel great here.'

Hazard signed from French club Lens two years ago but has failed to make an appearance for Chelsea and spent two years on loan at Waregem in Belgium.
