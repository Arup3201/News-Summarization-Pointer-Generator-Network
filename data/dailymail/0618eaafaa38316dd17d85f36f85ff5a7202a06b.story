The Birmingham Bears go in search of their first ever Twenty20 trophy on Finals Day on Saturday and Chris Woakes is confident they can upset the odds at home.

The Bears face Surrey in the last four, with Hampshire and Lancashire Lightning meeting in the other semi-final tie at Edgbaston but despite their consistent form across all three formats this season - they are third in the County Championship and in the quarter-finals of the Royal London Cup - Woakes insists his side are underdogs.

The 25-year-old all-rounder, who has taken four wickets and scored 28 runs in four Twenty20 matches this season, said: 'You could say we just snuck in the back door, qualifying fourth in the group. But you could also say we peaked at the right time.

High fives: The Birmingham Bears beat the Essex Eagles in the NatWest Blast T20 Finals Day

First semi-final: Surrey v Birmingham (11am)

Second semi: Hampshire v Lancashire (2.30pm)

Final at 6.45pm 

'It's my first finals day. I have been as a spectator before but never as a player.

'It should be a great experience and anyone can win it on the day - it's just whoever turns up.

'We face Surrey in the semi-finals and they have some world-class players throughout their team. It's on our home ground as well, and we have to take some confidence from that.

'Hampshire have been very strong this year and on paper they are probably most people's favourite for the title. Lancashire have some big players coming back though - particularly in James Anderson and Jos Buttler - so they will be no pushovers. 

'Whoever qualifies from that other semi-final is going to be a tough task. But we have to concentrate on Surrey first.'

Despite Woakes trying to play down their chances, the Bears have their fair share of match winners including Jonathan Trott, who despite his reputation for slow batting and limited involvement in this year’s competition used to be regarded as a Twenty20 specialist.

Woakes added: 'If he plays then we know he can and will do the business. He is excellent in and around the camp and he gives the other guys in the side confidence - and most importantly he just keeps scoring runs for us.

'But let's not forget we also have Ian Bell who is a world-class operator, too.

'Then, with guys like (Varun) Chopra and (William) Porterfield opening the batting, or (Jeetan) Patel providing us with some crucial off-spin bowling, we have to be confident.'
