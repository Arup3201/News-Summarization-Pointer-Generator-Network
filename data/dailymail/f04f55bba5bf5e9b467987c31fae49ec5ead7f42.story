Anger: When Timothy Sawyer was handed a penalty notice by a PCSO he screwed it up and then threw it at the officer

An angry motorist who screwed up a £30 parking ticket and threw it at a police community support officer has been fined £850 - for littering.

Timothy Sawyer, 64, was slapped with the penalty notice by a PCSO when he parked his Ford Fiesta on a single yellow line in the market town of Horncastle, Lincolnshire, in July last year.

A court heard Sawyer screwed the ticket up into a ball and threw it at the officer telling him: 'I will f****** well park here.'

He then drove off down the high street, leaving the £30 fine lying in the road.

Sawyer refused to pay the charge within seven days and turned down several requests from East Lindsey District Council (ELDC) for the money.

He was charged with a littering offence but failed to appear at Skegness Magistrates Court last Thursday.

The case proceeded in his absence and found him guilty of littering after hearing evidence from Police Community Support Officer Keith Briggs and a council enforcement officer.

Sawyer, who had indicated a not guilty plea in a letter presented to the court, was fined £200, ordered to pay costs of £637.61 as well as a £15 victim surcharge.

Prosecutor Beverley Dawes described Sawyer as aggressive and belligerent when he was approached by PCSO Briggs at the time of the offence.

She said the officer asked Sawyer whether he owned a disability permit, which would have allowed him to park on the yellow line, but was told: 'I haven't got a f****** badge.'

PCSO Briggs also told the court Sawyer had parked in a dangerous place, between a pedestrian crossing and a bus stop.

He added: 'I believe he would have driven off before I could write the ticket so I approached the driver's side of his vehicle.

'The window was open and I said to him "this is your ticket sir". He screwed it up into a ball, threw it out of the vehicle and drove off.'

Magistrates also heard Sawyer was abusive when council enforcement officers tracked him down and spoke to him on the telephone in August.

Kristina West, an ELDC enforcement officer, told the court: 'He made it clear he was not going to pay because of what he called "issues".

'He said it was stupid and silly. He was very rude so I told him I was not prepared to discuss the matter on the phone and I terminated the call.'

Miss West also said Sawyer had written abusive letters to the council, including the authority's chief executive.

Speaking today, Sawyer refused to comment about the incident but said he was launching a counter claim against Lincolnshire Police.

He said: 'I tell you what, they are going to have the shock of their lives - I'm not saying much more than that.

'But it has got to be the most expensive parking ticket ever.'

One of his neighbours added: 'He can be a grumpy old boy. He is very stubborn indeed.'

The smoker was originally fined £75 but it was upped to £560 after he did not pay (file picture)

A smoker caught throwing away a cigarette butt in the street will have to cough up £560 after failing to pay a much smaller fine.

Gethin Richards, 30, discarded the remains of a cigarette as he approached a street ATM to get out some money in the Welsh town of Pontyclun.

He was spotted by a Rhondda Cyon Taf County Borough Council enforcement officer and given a £75 fine in October last year.

However, Richards, of Clydach Vale, Tonypandy, failed to pay the fine within a fortnight and the case was referred to Pontypridd Magistrates' Court.

He also failed to attend and was found guilty in his absence.

As a result he was fined £400 and ordered to pay both £120 costs and a £40 victim surcharge.

He was prosecuted under the Environmental Protection Act, Section 87, for discarding a cigarette butt onto the public highway.

After the case a council spokesman warned there will be no let up in its on-going crackdown on what it describes as 'eco-crime'.

The council has recovered £43,950 since April 2012 from enforcing 586 fixed penalty notices.

All cash recovered - for everything from dog fouling to fly tipping and littering - is ploughed back into frontline services.

'Littering of any kind is illegal and is a common problem throughout the area of Rhondda Cynon Taf,' said Nigel Wheeler, council streetcare service director.

'This can have a detrimental impact on the environment and residents overall wellbeing.

'We all have a right to live in a clean, green environment and the council is committed to ensuring that those who jeopardise this with thoughtless acts will face the consequences.

'As well as creating unsightly environmental conditions, the clean up costs leave a financial burden on the local authority and the taxpayer.'
