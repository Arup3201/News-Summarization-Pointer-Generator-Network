When it comes to having a high-brow night out London has higher prices than any other European city, according to a new survey.

London is the most expensive city in Europe for cultural activities, even more costly that Paris for tickets to such attractions as ballet and opera, reveals the research from Post Office Travel Money.

Even with some museums and art galleries being admission-free in London, overall the city still surpassed 11 of the continent's other major cities.

For the survey the combined costs of a visit by two people was calculated for a museum, an art gallery, a heritage site, the ballet, the opera and a classical concert. 

High-brow, high-priced: Cultural experiences in London cost more than in other major European cities

The total for London was a whopping £256, with the most damaging elements being tickets for two to the Royal Ballet at £91 and opera setting a couple back £117.50.

The best value cities were Warsaw in Poland, where the combined cultural trips cost just £70. The next destination kindest to the wallet was Budapest (£80) followed by Prague (£93) and Dublin (£102). 

A visit by a couple to the National Ballet in Budapest cost just £15, while the Polish National Opera in Warsaw was only £20.

Despite the survey's findings, visitors are now in fact better off than they were in 2009 when a similar survey was conducted. 

The London cultural package then cost £326, more than 21% more than in 2014.

Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'While every city surveyed boasts world-class cultural attractions, prices vary dramatically. This means culture vultures can save hundreds of pounds by doing their homework before booking and swapping expensive cities for cheaper ones.' 

Cultural costs in Rome (down 36.1%) and Vienna (down 27.3%) have fallen even more than those of London since 2009, while Amsterdam (up 37.3%) has experienced the highest rise.Gordon Innes, CEO of London & Partners, the Mayor’s promotional company, defended the city's budget-busting prices: 'Not only do we [London] have world-class attractions such as the Royal Opera House, the English National Ballet, and many superb theatres, but many of our museums and galleries are completely free. 

'This means that people on any budget can experience some of the world's best collections of art and history at leading institutions such as the British Museum, Tate Modern, or the National History Museum – at no cost at all.

He added: 'London's cultural offering is extremely competitive with that of cities such as Paris and New York, as shown by the record number of tourists that we continue to see coming here to enjoy what the city has to offer.'
