If you're having no luck with online dating, it may be time to consider a pseudonym. Olivia or Jack would serve you well, according to new research.

Single people named Jack and Olivia are more likely to attract potential partners, a study released today reveals.

The research found that a person's name can lead to an 8 per cent swing in favourability on dating websites.

Of those polled, four in ten women (41 per cent) would consider dating someone called Jack.

Meanwhile, six in ten men (58 per cent) would visit someone's online dating profile if they were called Olivia.

Olivia and Jack have topped the baby name lists many times over the last few years - but all those little Olivias and Jacks will not yet be old enough to date.

However, the popularity of the names indicate that Brits are well-disposed to them.

'Date-ability' rankings for men1. Jack (41 per cent) 2. Barry (40 per cent)3. Riley (38 per cent)4. Trevor (38 per cent)5. Matt (37 per cent)6. David (37 per cent)7. Nigel (37 per cent)8. Dan (34 per cent)9. Alex (34 per cent)10. Wayne (33%)

Barry
 (40 per cent) is the second most popular men's name, while Chloe (58 
per cent) and Sharon (57 per cent) make up the top three females.

Wayne is the least popular men's name, while Ava is bottom of the girls' chart.

The new research, carried out by match.com, asked 2,178 single Brits to select names they would most and least like to go on a date with.

The dating service then selected the top and bottom five and tested them visually.

They showed a panel of 11,760 people a different version of the same profile with only the name changed.

Respondents were simply asked whether they would or wouldn't consider dating the person they were presented with.

Barry finished second, ahead of Matt, David and Dan.Sharon and Chantelle were voted ahead of Emily, Kate and Sophie.

The
 results showed an increase in favourability of up to 8 per cent for the
 most well-liked names when all other profile details were identical.

Kate Taylor, resident relationship expert at match.com, said: 'Everyone's views on names are subjective and influenced by their upbringing, peers and people they knew at school.

'It can be very easy to make a judgement on someone's personality based on their name - but this is a meaningless assumption.

'I'd always encourage online daters to review the full profile before making a snap decision, otherwise you're likely to find yourself missing out on some fantastic dates with lovely people.'

Smug: Yes! My name is Olivia AND I'm super hot thus men are more likely to click on my profile on a dating website
