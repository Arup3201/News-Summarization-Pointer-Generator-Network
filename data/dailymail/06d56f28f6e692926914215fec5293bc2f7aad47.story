A man fed up with using girly-smelling soaps has designed his own range using 'manly' fragrances such as beer, soil and even cash.

Adam Anderson  began creating his own concoctions in his kitchen after he realised most of the soaps available contain ingredients such as lavender or vanilla.

He mixed together cocoa, palm oil, and glycerin with secret ingredients to replicate the 
'manly' aromas.

Inventor Adam Anderson made the soaps after realising there were none with the manly aromas 'real men' would prefer, such as top soil and freshly cut grass

The products shun scents such as lavender and vanilla often used in male grooming products like facial moisturiser in favour of more 'manly' smells, such as beer or coffee

Other rustic fragrances in the product range are bonfire, coffee, red wine, freshly cut grass and cedar log cabin.

The products shun floral scents used even in some male grooming products such as moisturiser in favour of more 'manly' smells.

Mr Anderson, 27, from Nebraska in the U.S., 
said: 'It all started a few months ago when I went to wash my hands and 
noticed all the girly scented soaps we had around the house.

Some of the other odours available include the waft of a bacon sandwich or the aroma of red wine

'I thought to myself, "this is not how a mans hands should be smelling".

'Something needed to be done and that is when ManHands Soap started to come alive.

Smelling the money:  Mr Anderson even made CASH scented soap

'Before
 that I had never made soap before but after a few weeks of research I 
had produced my first batch of soap in my kitchen, which included 12 
different scents.

'I sat
 back and thought about what were some of the worlds favorite smells? 
Things like bacon and fresh cut grass and even buttered popcorn.

His home-made soaps have now developed into a set of 20 different bars which he began selling at art and craft shows.

Word about the unique soaps spread quickly and they are now available in a variety of shops and online for Â£4.40.

Mr Anderson added: 'Once
 people became brave enough to smell the sample jars I had of each scent
 they soon fell in love and couldn't believe how dead on the smells were.

'Even
 though its called ManHands, these soaps aren't just for the male buyer, 
lots of women enjoy some of the exact same scents as well.'
