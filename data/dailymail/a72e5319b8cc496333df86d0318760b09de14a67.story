Pregnant Katie Price has shopped her cross-dressing ex husband Alex Reid to police - claiming he stole her mobile phone.

Reality star and mother-of-three Katie, 34, thinks her cagefighter ex kept her mobile after their divorce and has reported a breach of privacy to officers.

Police confirmed they are looking into the claims under Operation Tulisa - the Met Police's investigation into phone hacking.

Investigation: Katie Price has accused ex husband Alex Reid of stealing a mobile phone belonging to her after their marriage ended - it is being looking into by police as a potential 'breach of privacy'

Alex, 37, who this week slammed ex Chantelle Houghton, claiming she was keeping his daughter Dolly away from his parents during supervised visits, has not made any comment on the alleged theft.

A Met Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'We can confirm that Operation Tuleta is looking into an allegation of breach of privacy that may be connected to the alleged theft of a mobile phone.

'We are not prepared to discuss further at this time.'

Happier times: Katie wed Alex after a whirlwind romance in February 2010

Katie dumped Alex in January 2011 after 11 months of marriage, but their divorce only came through last year.

She wed builder Kieran, nine years her junior, in the middle of January after a whirlwind month-long romance.

The businesswoman is already mother to son Harvey, 10, from her relationship with footballer Dwight Yorke, as well as two children with her first husband Peter Andre - Junior, seven, and Princess Tiaamii, five.

That was quick! Katie Price has revealed she's pregnant with her fourth child - her first with brand new husband Kieran Hayler

Model Kate has said she's already sat them down to tell them about the news and insists they are 'excited that a new brother or sister is on the way.'

Kieran spoken out to The Sun, revealing he is 'head over heels in love with Kate' and can't wait to start their family together.

Katie accepted Kieran's proposal on Christmas Day after just a few weeks of dating and admitted she was convinced he was 'the one' because a psychic had told her she would meet someone called... Kevin.

'A shock': Katie admits it wasn't part of their plan for now but they are over the moon and have shared the news with her three children

Katie's nuptials came less than three months after she called off her engagement to Argentine model Leandro Penna.

Katie and Alex started dating in summer 2009 - just two months after the model was heartbroken when first husband Peter filed for divorce.

The model and Peter famously fell in love on-screen when they both starred in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2004.

Numerous exes: Katie already has two children with her first husband Peter Andre - Junior, seven, and five-year-old Princess Tiaamii, while she has 10-year-old Harvey from her relationship with Dwight Yorke

They quickly moved in together and Katie fell pregnant with their son Junior, who was born in June 2005, joined by their daughter Princess in June 2007.

The couple wed in a high-profile £2million ceremony, complete with pink Cinderella-style carriage, which was filmed for an ITV2 show.

As well as her two marriages, Katie has been engaged twice before to men she hasn't married - Leandro and former Gladiator Warren 'Ace' Furman.

MailOnline has contacted Alex for a comment.
