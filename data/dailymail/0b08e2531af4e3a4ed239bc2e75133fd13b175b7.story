The U.S. Coast Guard is searching for two people who were aboard a small medical plane that crashed off the coast of Florida on Tuesday night, killing two others.

The Learjet 35 plane had already dropped off its patient at a hospital near Fort Lauderdale and the two pilots, a doctor and a nurse were returning to Mexico when the aircraft's engine apparently failed.

Pilots Jose Hiram Galvan de la O. and Josue Buend√≠a Moreno and passengers Fernando Senties Nieto and Mariana Gonzalez Isunza were on the plane, Mexico's Transportation Department.

Two bodies have been recovered but Mexican officials did not identify whom they belonged to.

Shortly after takeoff at 7.51pm, the pilot had reported
engine failure to air traffic controllers and said they were going to head back to the airport to land. A few minutes later, in response to the tower's instructions, the pilot says, 'Mayday, mayday, mayday.'

But the aircraft went down at 8.20pm 
about three miles northeast of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International 
Airport, and ended up in waters about a mile offshore, Federal Aviation Administration 
spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said.

Rescue workers were able to arrive at 
the debris site in roughly 25 minutes and two bodies were found immediately. They are continuing to search for the other two people on board.

Fort Lauderdale city spokesman Matt Little told NBC Miami that the bodies of one man and one woman were found near the debris.

'We still have a very active search 
and rescue case going on this morning off the coast of Fort Lauderdale,'
Coast Guard Lt. Commander Gabe Somma said at a new conference on 
Wednesday.

'We continue at this hour to be fully engaged in a search and rescue effort.'

Somma
said crews were searching a massive debris field of approximately 20 
square miles and said that 1,000 pounds of debris had been recovered.

Destroyed: The cause of the crash is under investigation but the pilot had said the engine was failing

The doctor and nurse worked for 
AirEvac International, according to a dispatcher for the air ambulance 
and transportation company, while the pilots worked for the aircraft's 
operator.

AirEvac said 
their focus is on the victims, who had just picked up a patient in Costa
Rica and dropped the patient off at a South Florida hospital.

'These are people that are dedicated to saving lives,' said Albert Carson, director of operations for AirEvac International.

He
said the company had sent documents to the Mexican consulate to try to 
identify the deceased, a process that continued Wednesday afternoon.

Carson
promised there would be an investigation and said the company would be 
'transparent and open'. The company's main bases of operation are in 
Mexico, Central America and South America and San Diego, California, 
according to its website.

Federal Aviation Administration officials warned of potential problems found in the Learjet 35 in June.

According to the special bulletin, maintenance workers found cracks in the control column on Learjet Model 35A (C-21A) airplanes. Five airplanes were inspected and all five had cracks in the area at the base of the column where it attaches to the floor.

But the concern was not deemed dangerous enough to warrant a further directive, according to the bulletin.

'We will search until sunset. That's when we'll have to make a new game plan,' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.
