With James Rodriguez returning to the Real Madrid squad, Spanish publication Marca have splashed about how Carlo Ancelotti has his 'six nations' available again.

The former Monaco playmaker has been out of action since the beginning of February with a foot injury, but has been named in the Real starting XI for the visit of Granada on Sunday.

And with that, Ancelotti has a fearsome front line of different nationalities ready to chase down Barcelona in the La Liga run-in.

Real Madrid have their 'six nations' available again: (back l-r) Toni Kroos (Germany), Karim Benzema (France), Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) - (front) Gareth Bale (Wales), James Rodriguez (Colombia), Luka Modric (Croatia

Mundo Deportivo splash about Lionel Messi's fitness while AS say it is 'operation 30 points' for Carlo Ancelotti

Rodriguez (Colombia), Toni Kroos (Germany), Gareth Bale (Wales), Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) and Luka Modric (Croatia, who has also recently returned to full fitness, form the 'hard core' of the Bernabeu side.

Elsewhere in Spain, AS claim the rest of the season will be 'operation 30 points' for Ancelotti, with the Italian coach insisting it is not impossible that they will win their remaining 10 games.

Mundo Deportivo cover Lionel Messi's foot injury, with the Argentine forward recovering from a foot problem to be part of the Barcelona squad to face Celta Vigo.

Meanwhile in Italy, the city of Milan takes centre stage. Filipo Inzaghi's AC Milan beat Palermo 2-1 to make it two wins in a row and maintain a slim hope of European football next season.

But Roberto Mancini reportedly brought his Inter Milan squad into training at 8.30am on Easter Sunday after they were held by crisis club Parma.

Inter were booed off at the San Siro, and haven't won in Serie A since February. 

There were contrasting results in Serie A for AC Milan and Inter on Saturday, while Juventus won again
