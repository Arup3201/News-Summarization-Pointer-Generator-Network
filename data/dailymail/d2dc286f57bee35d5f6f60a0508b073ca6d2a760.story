Two additional whales washed up on New York's Long Island shore just hours apart, less than a month after a pregnant whale washed up on New York's Breezy Point shore and died soon after.

Among the most recent New York whale fatalities, one was found dead and the other was later euthanized, marine officials said.

The two helpless marine mammals were discovered on Sunday on separate stretches of East Hampton beaches, Newsday reports.

Previous whale fatality: A 60-foot finback whale was found washed ashore in New York's Breezy Point on Wednesday, December 26, 2012

The Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation said they don't believe the two events are connected.

The first whale was found dead around 8am in Napeague.

Officials say there were no outward signs of what may have caused the death of the 59-foot-long female finback whale.

At around 2.30pm, officials got a report of a 5-foot-long juvenile pygmy sperm whale in nearby Amagansett.

The foundation told Newsday the young whale was euthanized because it had skin lesions and appeared ‘sickly.’

Necropsies will be performed on both mammals on Monday.

On Wednesday, December 26, 2012, a 60-foot finback whale was found washed ashore in New York's Breezy Point.

The whale was reportedly moving its flippers and opening its mouth which a biologist said were signs of stress.
