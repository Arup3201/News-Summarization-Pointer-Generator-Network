British firms who do not export to the EU should be freed from the most burdensome Brussels regulations, hundreds of business leaders will say today.

Business for Britain, a Eurosceptic campaign group representing 800 business leaders, will propose that only the five per cent of UK companies who trade with the Continent should be subject to the rules of the single market.

It says reform should form a centrepiece of Britain’s demands for a looser relationship with the EU in a renegotiation of membership promised by David Cameron ahead of an in/out referendum if the Conservatives win the next election.

Though it is far from clear that other EU member states would countenance such an opt-out, the plan is winning considerable support among Eurosceptic Tories, including former Europe minister David Davis and former Cabinet minister John Redwood.

Under the so-called ‘British Option’, EU laws would continue to augment UK business law, but Parliament would approve a list of regulations that would not apply to companies and organisations that do not trade with the single market.

The campaign group foresees the UK remaining a member of a reformed EU, ensuring that all companies that export to the EU retain full access to the single marker.

However, the majority of British firms would be freed from regulation estimated to cost them around £7.5 billion a year. They include the working time directive, limiting working hours, the temporary agency work directive, giving the same rights to temps as permanent staff, and the EU climate change and energy package.

The move would ‘hugely benefit’ jobs in the UK and could be replicated across the EU should other member states wish to compete more effectively, today’s report says.

Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, said: ‘It is clear from our survey of the business community that they want a forward-looking relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.

‘Business leaders want access to the single market for the five per cent of firms that trade with the EU, but they also want to make Britain more competitive in the global race and to ensure that we are better able to trade with the high-growth areas of the world.’

‘Many different, often complex ideas have been advanced to improve or refine the single market in the EU, but none have yet tackled the huge regulatory and financial burden it places on the 95 per cent of companies that don’t even export to the Continent.

‘By excluding these firms and organisations that don’t need access to the single market from the most burdensome aspects of EU regulation, the Government would, at a stroke, better position Britain.’

Former Europe minister David Davis is thought to be one of many behind the proposals

Mr Davis, a former Europe minister, said: ‘This is a very good proposal. I’d vote to leave the EU if we get no change. If we achieve this, it would make me change my mind.

‘If the people who run Europe want to hold it together, they should be giving this very serious consideration. It won’t just appeal to the majority of British businesses who don’t access the single market, but big majorities of businesses in most successful countries across the EU.’

Former Conservative Cabinet minister Mr Redwood said: ‘I think this is a brilliant idea. It would solve overnight the problem of small businesses and European regulation. We can’t have a situation where the tail wags the dog.’

Dominic Raab, Tory MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘This win-win proposal would be a major boost to Britain’s small businesses and rising global exports, whilst recognising the reality that EU rules cover EU trade. The government should look closely at the idea. We will need creative thinking like this, if we are to navigate a path to a successful renegotiation of UK membership of the EU.’

But Adam Nathan, of the pro-EU campaign group British Influence, said: ‘These proposals would amount to a bureaucratic nightmare. While there is always scope for reducing the regulatory burden for businesses, these proposals would scupper the single market, which is based on the principle that anything legitimately put on the market in one member state may be put on the market across the whole EU.

‘This would be a disaster for our EU exports which account for 14 per cent of our GDP and small businesses looking to expand through exporting into Europe would face the double burden of complying with both UK and EU regulations.’

TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘This is just another attempt to take away people’s rights to paid holiday leave, health and safety at work, fairness and equality. It would take away basic employment rights – as well as protections like food safety and consumer rights – from everyone except the chosen few in Britain’s export industries.

‘It would create a two-tier economy with reams of bureaucratic red tape. It’s impractical, unworkable and unjust.’
