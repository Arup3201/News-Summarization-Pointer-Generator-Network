Andrea Rubio, 14, came to England on a year-long placement from Gauadalajara, Mexico, to improve her English.

And all those hours conjugating verbs and practicing pronouns came in very handy on Sunday when she met two VIPs at a Gloucestershire polo match and was able to ask them politely (and extremely excitably) to smile for the camera.

So in July she will return to her hometown armed not only with fluent English, but also with a very special photo to adorn her bedroom wall: a snapshot of a grinning Prince William and a chuckling Prince Harry, trundling through the grass after the match.

Andrea was herself photographed running up to the young royals and excitedly taking their photograph using her iPhone, and was featured doing so in MailOnline.

Speaking to MailOnline, Andrea said: 'I was really so excited and not at all shy. I just ran towards them and said, "Could you please smile for my picture?"

'And they did. Both of them smiled at me. And then they started laughing.

'I was so excited. I said thank you and then I ran off. I was very polite but I didn't think to curtsey - I didn't really know what that is.

'I sent the photo to my friends and family who think it is hilarious.'

Andrea has been a fan of the young royals for some time, believing they are 'quite important for England, and really smart-looking'.

But would she have reacted the same way if the Queen had turned up?

'I don't think I would have run up to the Queen. She's a bit too important.'

Andrea has spent a year on an 
exchange programme at Westonbirt School in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and
was watching the charity polo match at the local Beaufort Polo Club.

She
said: 'I'm going to keep the photograph on my iPhone to look at, and 
maybe print it out and put it on my wall.

'This is the most exciting 
thing that has happened to me all year. I will go home happy now.'

Andrea
even had a tip for Prince William, 30, with regards to the naming of 
his first child, who his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, is expecting 
in July.

'I
like Kate and she is very pretty.' she said. 'So I think it would be good if they had a girl as she would be pretty too. It would be nice to call
her Diana.'

Andrea Rubio was overcome with excitement after the Princes smiled at her for the photograph
