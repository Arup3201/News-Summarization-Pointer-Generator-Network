New Yorkers with a taste for unique architecture and plenty money to spare can now get a sweet deal on the famous Gingerbread House - just in time for the winter holidays.

The century-old Brooklyn home, which looks like it's been plucked straight out of a Brothers Grimm fairy tale, is now available for rent at $26,000 a month.

The whimsical uncut stone-and-wood confection situated in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn boasts six bedrooms, 3.5 bathrooms and a three-car garage.

The sprawling yet charming mansion, which occupies an entire city block on Narrows Avenues, was built in 1917 in the Arts-and-Crafts style by renowned architect James Sarsfield Kennedy for shipping merchant Howard Jones.

The story-book 5,700-square-foot house includes four main bedrooms and two guestrooms with terraces; a winding wooden staircase; a wine cellar; a pair of well-appointed living rooms with overstuffed couches and armchairs; a gourmet kitchen; a fountain room; a screening room, and a formal wood-paneled dining room with a stunning fireplace.

Outside, the new tenants of the Gingerbread House will be able enjoy eating al fresco in the backyard surrounded by a perfectly manicured lawn and cheery flowerbeds.

The unique residence sitting on 20,000 square feet of land is filled with eye-catching details, including cast-iron doorknobs, stained-glass windows and chandeliers, painted ceilings and wooden floors polished to perfection, reported Philly.com. 

According to the home's listing on the real estate site Corcoran, the Gingerbread House is considered to be one of the most beautiful homes in the US.

'Some have called it magical. You can simply call it home. It is an incredible blending of imagination, architectural genius, and nature with art, storytelling, and style... and yes, perhaps a bit of magic,' according to the site.

For those who are interested in making the Gingerbread House their 'forever home,' the Bay Ridge property is also up for sale for $10.5million.
