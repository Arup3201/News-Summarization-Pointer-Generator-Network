The crane operator accused of being high on marijuana when a Philadelphia building collapsed on to a thrift store, killing six people, has turned himself into police.

Sean Benschop was wanted on six counts of involuntary manslaughter, 13 counts of recklessly endangering another person and one count of risking a catastrophe.

Authorities believe the 42-year-old had been using an excavator on Wednesday when the remains of the four-storey building gave way, killing two employees and four customers, and injuring 13 others.

Deputy Mayor Everett Gillison told The Associated Press a toxicology report showed evidence that Mr Benschop was high on marijuana.

That finding, combined with witness statements and evidence led to the decision on Friday to raid his north Philadelphia home, he said.

Mr Benschop had samples of his 
blood and urine tested at a hospital about two hours after part of the 
building on Market Street crumbled on to the Salvation Army thrift store 
below on Wednesday morning.

Sources also told CBS Philadelphia that police officers noticed Mr Benschop was speaking in an unusually slow and quiet manner, as if he were whispering.

The
42-year-old crane operator allegedly told investigators that he has 
been taking prescription pain medications after suffering a cut to his 
finger recently.

Mr Benschop, who also goes by the name Kary Roberts, has been arrested at least 11 times since 1994 on charges ranging from drugs to theft to weapons possession, according to court records.

He was twice sentenced to prison in the 1990s after being convicted on drug trafficking charges.

At least two survivors have sued the demolition contractor and building owner, alleging gross recklessness at the job site.

The city has since promised to improve the demolition industry.

'We can do much better,' Mayor Michael Nutter said. 'We will not accept the status quo in the face of this tragedy.'

Mr Nutter's reform for construction sites includes random drug testing on heavy equipment operators.

The
mayor also pledged to adopt tougher background requirements for 
demolition contractors, including information about each worker's 
experience, and frequent site inspections.

His plan could run into resistance from builders who say they are already highly regulated.

'I
think that before we do anything, before we rush to any judgment about 
how to fix what happened, we have to have all the facts," Steven Lakin, 
of the General Building Contractors Association, which represents 
Philadelphia contractors, said.

'Everybody wants to regulate demolition contractors, but I'm not so sure that's the answer.'

Lawyers for the two survivors who 
have sued accuse demolition contractor Griffin Campbell of violating 
federal safety regulations.

No one answered the phone at a listing for Campbell on Saturday, and the voice mailbox was full.

Linda
Bell, a 50-year-old mother of three, was shopping at the thrift store 
when the building came down . She fell into the basement and was covered
by rubble for more than an hour.

'She's still shook up real bad, sore, swollen up,' Ms Bell's brother, Keith, said.

He added that his sister was suffering after 'seeing other people getting killed'.

Construction engineers said the thrift store should have been evacuated during the demolition project taking place next to it.

'There
was communication between the Salvation Army and the attorney of the 
neighboring building's owner, pertaining to the demolition. The neighbor
assured The Salvation Army that they would be taking proper 
precautions,' Major Robert W. Dixon, the Salvation Army's Philadelphia 
director of operations said.

Mr Benschop, who described himself as being 'self-employed,' was working on the Market Street site as part of a demolition project handled by Griffin Campbell Construction.

Mr Campbell's company was handing 
demolition at multiple adjacent properties along the 2100 block of 
Market Street, including house number 2136, which came crashing down on 
Wednesday.

It was revealed Thursday that nearly a 
month before the deadly collapse that ended the lives of six people, the
City of Philadelphia had been made aware of potentially unsafe 
demolition practices at the site.
