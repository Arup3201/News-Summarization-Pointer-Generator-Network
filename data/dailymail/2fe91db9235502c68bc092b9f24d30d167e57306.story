Legia Warsaw have sent an open letter to Celtic requesting a one-off match in either Glasgow or Warsaw to determine who should qualify for the next round of the Champions League.

The Polish side thrashed the Scottish champions 6-1 over two legs in the third qualifying round of the competition, but were then kicked out of the competition by UEFA after fielding ineligible player, Bartosz Bereszynski.

But they have now written to Celtic to another chance to play Maribor in the play-off for the group stage.

Legia co-owner Daruisz Mioduski wrote in the letter 'Meet in Warsaw or in Glasgow and let's settle this matter honourably.'
