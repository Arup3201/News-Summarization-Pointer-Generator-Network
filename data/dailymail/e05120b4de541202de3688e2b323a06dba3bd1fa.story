Early on Sunday morning, Ommy Irizarry posted a message on Facebook to mark his ninth wedding anniversary.

'I am very happy and can't wait to see what the next 100 have in store for us,' he wrote, and tagged his wife, Rebecca, in the post.

But hours later, Irizarry, 36 was killed during a freak plane crash on a Florida Gulf Coast beach near Sarasota, where they were celebrating their anniversary. The couple's daughter, 9-year-old Oceana, was critically injured.

Tragic: This is the message that Ommy Irizarry posted to Facebook on Sunday morning, just hours before he lost his life and his nine-year-old daughter was critically injured in a freak plane crash landing on a Florida beach

The 1972 Piper Cherokee lost a wheel, damaged a wing and smashed its propeller shortly after making a distress call about 2:45 p.m. Sunday to Venice Municipal Airport, officials said.

The plane crash-landed on Caspersen Beach, just south of the airport, at the southern tip of the island of Venice.

Irizarry and his daughter were hit by the plane or its debris, officials said.

Irizarry died at the scene. His daughter was airlifted to All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg. Officials have not released further information about the victims.

Moving: One of Ommy and Rebecca Irizarry's children wrote in the sand a message that said, 'I love (heart) Mom and Dad' - and was posted onto Facebook by the Army Sgt. hours before his death

Family man: Ommy Irizarry, 36, with his three children. The father-of-three was killed in a tragic accident on Sunday when a light aircraft crash landed on Caspersen Beach in Florida. His nine-year-old daughter, Oceana (second right) was critically injured in the incident also

The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating.

Family friend Kim Howard described Irizarry as 'a great, hands-on father' to three children.

He was an Army sergeant stationed at Fort Stewart in Georgia, according to officials, and Howard said the family was scheduled to be stationed in Alaska.

The couple's Facebook pages were filled with photos of the family enjoying beaches in Georgia and in Ommy's native Puerto Rico.

Fatal crash: The 1972 Piper Cherokee made an emergency landing on Caspersen Beach in Venice

On Saturday, Ommy posted a photo from a beach near Sarasota, with the words 'I love Mom + Dad,' scrawled in the sand, with the symbol for a heart in place of the word love.

Rebecca's page showed a photo of her and her husband in the water, smiling for the camera. About 4 p.m. Sunday, she wrote: 'We need prayers, now! Please stop and pray for Ommy and Oceana.'

It's unclear how the plane or the debris hit father and daughter. A woman calling 911 from at the airport first informed officials that the plane would be landing on the beach.

'He's trying to make the airport,' said the caller. 'He says he's not going to make the airport. But he's going to be on the beach.'

Ommy Irizarry was killed and his daughter seriously injured while walking 
along a Florida beach when a small plane crash landed Sunday on the Gulf
 Coast only feet from the surf, authorities said.

Resting: The pilot of the 1972 Piper Cherokee and his passenger were uninjured in the crash landing

Runway: The pilot indicated to air traffic controllers that he was going to use the hard sand bank on Caspersen Beach as a runway to land

In other 911 calls, a family friend cried as she described the scene while screams and wailing could be heard in the background. Another man told a dispatcher about the little girl's condition.

'She's breathing a little right now,' a man said. 'Rapid pulse and difficult breathing. She's unconscious.'

Sheriff's officials say the pilot radioed the airport that he was having trouble with the plane and was planning to land on the beach because he could not make it to the airport.

'He landed on the edge of the water,' said Wendy Rose, a sheriff's office spokeswoman.

Officials say the pilot was Karl Kokomoor, 57, and the passenger was David Theen, 60, both of nearby Englewood. They were not injured.

National Transportation and Safety Board spokesman Terry Williams said the plane will be removed from the beach Monday afternoon.
