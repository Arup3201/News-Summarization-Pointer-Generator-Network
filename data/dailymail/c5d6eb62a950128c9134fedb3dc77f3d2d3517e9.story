Fleur Strong, director of Parents Against Child Sexual Exploitation (Pace), told MailOnline that people retreated to a 'comfort zone' of thinking grooming and abuse only happen 'elsewhere'

Children are being sexually abused in every town in the country, police and experts warned today.

Fleur Strong, director of Parents Against Child Sexual Exploitation (Pace), told MailOnline that people retreated to a 'comfort zone' of thinking grooming and abuse only happen 'elsewhere'.

And Detective Superintendent Paul Sanford said CSE was taking place in 'all communities' across the country.

In the last year police have been inundated with reports of child sexual exploitation, including historic cases and allegations of grooming and trafficking across the country.

It follows high profile historical cases involving celebrities such as Jimmy Savile and revelations about sex gangs in Rotherham and Rochdale.

But Ms Strong insisted it was wrong to think the crimes were only restricted to parts of the country or certain 'types' of children.

'It's a global crime so the concept of it only happening in a section of the country is wrong, it's across the whole country,' she told MailOnline. 'This type of abuse is in every town.'

She said one of the problems was that parents and other adults prefer to think that child sex abuse is not the sort of thing that happens where they live.

'We are all in a much better comfort zone if we think this type of abuse happens elsewhere and its other people who are affected and it's other people doing the crime, that there is another ring going on.

'And it's something that we need to try and change.'

She insisted the warning was not about 'scaremongering', adding: 'What we are trying to do is make it calmer and to say that this type of child abuse is occurring across the country.'

She said she knew of serious cases involving families in Exeter, Norfolk, East Anglia, Cumbria, the Borders and Torquay.

She warned that it was wrong to think only children in major cities were at risk.

'If you look at North Yorkshire, it only takes 30minutes to get into Leeds or Bradford or Sheffield.

'Almost anywhere in the country, you are within 30 or 40 minutes of a large town or city and children are trafficked.

'If we have a preconceived idea as to the sort of child that is at risk, what you are missing out on is the fact that there are other victims as well.

'They are teenagers, 13, 14, 15, 16 year-olds. These are young adults and they are different to a younger child.

'We are not talking about abuse in the home, it is outside, it can often start in schools. It is a very complex crime.'

Pace said it had noticed an increase in people using so-called 'legal highs' to groom youngsters for sex and the crime was widespread across Britain.

A major problem for police and social services is that where teenagers have been groomed they are not even aware that they are being abused and often believe they are in a loving relationship.

This can make it difficult to persuade them to give evidence against their abusers.

The police in the past have also been accused of failing to take the issue seriously and not believing some of the victims who have come forward.

The Office of the Children's Commissioner has estimated that there are some 16,000 children at risk of child sexual exploitation.

DS Sanford, a spokesman for the national child protection working group, said the police had made progress in improving the response to all forms of child abuse.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Child sexual abuse has been hidden in our society for too long and, certainly in recent months, that picture has changed.

'The police is certainly now committed to doing all we can to root out child sexual exploitation and prevent more people from becoming victims.

'It is an abhorrent crime, there is absolutely no doubt about that. We are learning lessons, we have learned significant lessons from the past, but we are absolutely committed to improving the police response to these sorts of awful acts.'

He added: 'The last 12 months have been shocking, in terms of the scale. What we know is the Office of the Children's Commissioner have estimated that there are some 16,000 children at risk of CSE across the country.

'That CSE takes place in all communities. There has been a model which has been frequently reported in the media over the last 12 months linked to cases such as Rotherham and Rochdale, but let's be clear: it takes place in all communities, urban, rural, small and large.

'I don't think there will be a community that could not potentially be affected by CSE.

'We are facing unprecedented demand within policing. We know that, across most forces, reports of abuse are going up by 17 per cent year on year.

'That abuse is made up of a number of things. Most recently we have seen increases in reports of historic sexual abuse in institutions and also by well-known personalities and by groups and gangs.

'There is nothing that causes me to believe that situation is going to change and we are not going to see a continuation of the level of reporting.'Â
