A grieving husband has been accused of assaulting a traffic warden who tried to ticket cars outside his home while he waited for his wife's funeral cortege.

Angry relatives confronted the warden as he was allegedly preparing to issue them fines while they waited for the hearse carrying the body of cancer victim Rena Page, 64.

Her stunned husband Mac Page, 66, challenged the official who later reported him to the police for assault.

Stunned: Matthew Page, 39, with wife Kerrie outside his family's home where a traffic warden tried to issue tickets as they waited for his mother's funeral cortege. His father is accused of assaulting the warden

Four cars were briefly parked on a 
single yellow line outside Mr Page's home in Hunstanton, Norfolk, as 
the funeral cars moved into position.

The family confronted the official who allegedly carried on noting the cars' details. A funeral director is also reported to have tried to intervene.

Angry family members admit they challenged the warden but were stunned to later learn he had reported widower Mr Page for assault.

Mr Page, a self-employed gardener, said yesterday: 'I can’t describe how I felt really. It was bad enough to bury someone at 64 after 48 years of marriage. This bloke didn’t show any compassion at all.

Mourned: Relatives of Rena Page, 64, who died of cancer, have accused the warden of behaving heartlessly

'If it was the middle of the season and there were lots of cars about, I could at least understand it a little bit, but he was just being a jobsworth. The last three years - watching my wife die of cancer - have been quite horrendous, now we have this to deal with on top.

'What I couldn’t believe is that when we rang to complain, his boss backed him up. How can anyone in authority back somebody like that up? It beggars belief.'

Mr Page said he was happy to appear in court to give his version of events.

His son Matthew Page, 39, who runs a chip shop, added: 'There was just a total lack of respect - and they wonder why they get a bad name. The worst thing was Mum never liked a fuss. This turned it all into a debacle. I cannot believe someone could be so insensitive.'

Funeral director John Lincoln, who was leading the cortege, said: 'I have never known anything like this before. He might lose someone one day and I wonder how he would react if this sort of thing happened to him.'

A West Norfolk Council spokesman confirmed discretion exists within its parking rules for occasions such as funerals, but refused to apologise until the outcome of the police investigation into the assault was known.

The spokesman said: 'Following the incident referred to, a member of our staff reported an assault and the matter is now with the police. We await the outcome of any subsequent investigations.'

The spokesman said no tickets were issued during the incident but that vehicles attending a funeral, 'are not exempt from parking rules. When we are made aware of a funeral, we work to accommodate the hearse and funeral cortege respectfully,' he added.Father-of-two Matthew Page has lodged an official complaint with the council.  A spokesman for Norfolk police confirmed the force was investigating a reported assault.
