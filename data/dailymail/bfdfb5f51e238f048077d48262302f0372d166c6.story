A high-priced prostitute injected a married Google executive with a fatal dose of heroin before callously stepping over his dying body to finish her glass of wine, police have revealed.

Alix Tichelman, 26, was arrested on Friday in the death of Forrest Hayes, a 51-year-old father-of-five and former Apple exec, aboard his yacht in Santa Cruz, California last November.

Tichelman, who met her clients through a website called Seeking Arrangement, had exchanged texts and emails with Hayes and met with him a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter.

That day, they met on Hayes' 50-foot yacht, Escape, at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the drug, police said.

'Callous': Alex Tichelman, 26, left, did nothing as her wealthy client Forrest Hayes, right, suffered complications from a heroin overdose and died. Instead of calling 911, she gathered her belongings and left, police said

Surveillance video from inside the luxury boat shows Hayes 'suffering medical complications' and losing consciousness - but Tichelman makes no attempt to help him or call 911, police said.

Instead, she is seen gathering her belongings, stepping over his dying body to finish her glass of wine and then leaving the boat - pulling a window blind down to conceal his body from outside.

Hayes was found dead the next morning by the boat's captain, the Santa Cruz Sentinel reported.

'She showed no regard for him. She was just trying to cover her tracks,' Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark said on Tuesday.

Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident and uncovered Tichelman's correspondence with the victim.Â

'We know they've had a previous 
relationship, they've shared time together before,' Clark told KION.

'This was all set up 
through text messages and emails. We also know what she did in the 
aftermath of this. We have her computer records, we know the Google 
searches that she made, the things she did to try to get herself out of 
this.'

Police identified Tichelman from the video and also found her fingerprints on the wine glass, police said.

They then tracked her down to her home in Folsom, where she lives with her parents, but lured her back to Santa Cruz County by posing as a client who said he wanted to pay her $1,000 for sex. She agreed to meet at a luxury hotel on Fourth of July and was arrested.

She was booked into jail on suspicion of second-degree murder, concealing evidence and transportation of narcotics on Friday and remains there on a $1.5 million bond.

When asked if the overdose was accidental or intentional, Clark said evidence showed a level of guilt that reached second-degree murder rather than involuntary manslaughter, the Sentinel reported.

'She showed absolutely no regard for this person she injected with heroin,' Clark said. 'She had a responsibility to provide some lifesaving effort.'

Detectives said they are also investigating Tichelman for a similar death in another state.

Hayes, who was originally from Dearborn, Michigan was married for 17 years to wife Denise and together they had five children, according to his obituary.

He worked in the auto industry before senior roles at Apple and Google.

'Forrest will be remembered above all as a loving husband and father. More than anything else he enjoyed spending time with his family at home and on his boat,' according to a January obituary.

'His brilliant mind, contagious smile and warm embrace will be missed and cherished in memories by his friends and family.'

Tichelman's Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty school. She lists her occupation as a makeup artist.

Fetish fan: Tichelman was arrested on Friday after police posed as a client and met her at a hotel

Dark: In an interview, she said she had always been obsessed with horror movies; police called her 'callous'

She called herself a 'model' in jail records.

On social media, she poses in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the camera, and posts suggest she had a boyfriend as recently as a couple of months ago.

In an interview with fiXE fETISH magazine, she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character.

'I have always been attracted to the darker side,' she said. 'My parents said by the time I was three I was an "intense child" and already liked horror movies.'

She added that she loved fetishism and would often wear a leash when she went out with her nightclub owner boyfriend.

She also posted pictures under another Facebook profile, AK Kennedy, and talks about heroin and her love of the TV show about a serial killer, 'Dexter'.

Seeking Arrangement, the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met, is described as being a site for connecting 'sugar babies' with 'sugar daddies and mommas' - but the company maintains it is not promoting prostitution.
