Investigators who believe a defendant killed himself in a Phoenix courtroom shortly after a jury found him guilty of arson say their theory is backed up by evidence that includes a canister labeled as cyanide found in his vehicle.

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said Tuesday that the family of Michael Marin, 53, received a delayed email from him the night after his June 28 death in court.

The email includes information about his will in case things went poorly, Arpaio said.

Last resort: After being found guilty of burning down his own home and facing years in jail, Michael Marin appeared to swallow a substance in the Arizona courtroom

Emergency: The 53-year-old was stretchered out of the court in Phoenix minutes later but died in hospital

After being convicted of deliberately burning down his $3.5 million Phoenix mansion, Marin appeared shocked. He closed his 
eyes as the verdict was read before appearing to put something in his 
mouth and wash it down with liquid in a plastic water bottle. 

In
the shocking court room video, he then fell to the floor a few minutes 
later in convulsions. Mr Marin was taken to a hospital in Phoenix, 
Arizona, where he was pronounced dead.

When Marin's trial began in May, prosecutors said he could face 16 years in prison if he was convicted. Marin burned down his Phoenix mansion on July 5, 2009 after it failed to sell at a charity auction.

The email also led Marin's family to his vehicle, and they contacted the sheriff's office. Investigators found a can labeled 'cyanide' in Marin's vehicle. The canister was turned over to the medical examiner's office unopened.

Cari Gerchick, communications director for Maricopa County, said the medical examiner's office could not immediately confirm if the canister indeed contains cyanide. Gerchick said the medical examiner's office is still determining Marin's cause and manner of death.

Arpaio said investigators have determined that Marin purchased the canister from a California-based Internet site in 2011 using his personal credit card.

Distress: Marin, a father of four and a grandfather, faced up to 16 years in prison after a jury found him guilty of arson

Ashen-faced: Marin, a former Wall Street trader, was found guilty of torching his $3.5million mansion because he could not afford the mortgage

Fire Department investigators 
determined the fire was deliberate after finding several points of 
origin throughout the sprawling  6,600 sq ft home with four garages.

Marin later told authorities that he had escaped after setting the fire by climbing from the second floor using a rope ladder and wearing a scuba-diving suit, according to Fox.

No one was injured in the blaze but the 
charge of committing arson of an occupied structure holds the same 
number of years in prison in Arizona as second-degree murder.

Prosecutors claimed Marin set fire to his house in desperation because he could no longer pay the mortgage.

Marin, a father of four and grandfather of two, attended Yale Law School. He was an ex-Wall Street trader who enjoyed collecting art including Picasso sketches and described himself as a 'careful thrill seeker' to the Phoenix New Times after scaling Mount Everest and trips into the jungles of south-east Asian.
