The electric car industry was handed a £37million boost by the taxpayer yesterday – even though only 2,300 were sold last year.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced a subsidy for homes and businesses which fit plug-in points for the cars.

It will pay up to three-quarters of the installation costs, which range from £1,000 to £10,000.Hospitals, police and public bodies may have the full price paid. 

The government wants to encourage the ownership of electric cars, such as the Vauxhall Ampera (pictured)

The news comes amid fears that battery-powered cars are losing their spark with drivers.

Only 3,200 have sold in the last two 
years – less than 1 per cent of the total market – despite green 
discounts of £5,000 per car.

In 2012 just 2,237 electric cars were sold and 
registered for the ‘plug-in car grant’, though that is double the figure
of 1,052 in 2011 and a big increase on the 111 in 2010.

Studies show the fear of losing power on the road is a top reason people do not use the vehicles.

Mr McLoughlin announced the subsidy 
on a visit to Sunderland, where Nissan produces its Leaf electric car. 
He said he wanted Britain to be a world leader in the electric car 
industry.

Patrick McLoughlin plans to give more incentive for installing an electric car charge point

But he rejected criticisms that 
electric sales were poor because they were only of use in towns, and 
insisted manufacturers would not be making them if there were not a 
market for them: ‘They are fantastic cars.’

The new multi-million pound funding 
package aims to kick-start home and on-street charging, as well as the 
creation of new charge points for people parking plug-in vehicles at 
railway stations, by offering subsidies covering up to 75 per cent of 
the cost of installing the charging points.

Hospitals, the police and other public bodies are set to have the full cost of the installation covered.

The announcement was made at Gateshead
College’s Skills Academy for Sustainable Manufacturing and Innovation 
next to Nissan’s site in Sunderland.

The cash-boost follows a critical 
report by MP watchdogs in September which said electric car sales are 
stalling except as ‘subsidised second cars for the rich’ allowing the 
affluent middle classes to run around town and appear 
environmentally-friendly. The MP’s report said Government grants were 
‘subsidising second cars for affluent households’.

It concluded that despite the £5,000 
per car ‘green’ subsidy, electric vehicles have lost their spark and 
proved too expensive for most motorists. Past failure by ministers to 
provide enough public plug-in power points also means electric car sales
had fallen flat threatening an end to the Government’s electric dreams,
said the report by the House of Commons transport Select Committee.

The Department for Transport said the 
£37million funding for the package comes from the Government’s 
£400million commitment to increase the uptake of ultra-low emission or 
‘green’ vehicles and is available until April 2015.

Installing a charge-point in a home 
costs about £1,000-£1,500, while rapid chargers can cost around £45,000.
A charge-point capable of charging two vehicles at once in residential 
streets or train stations costs around £10,000.

The full package announced today 
includes up to £13.5million for a 75per cent grant for homeowners who 
want domestic charge-point installed at their. There is also an 
£11million fund for councils in England to install on-street charging 
for residents who have a plug in vehicle but do not have off-street 
parking.

Up to £9million is being made available to fund charge-points at railway stations.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin
said: ‘This investment underlines the Government’s commitment to making
sure that the UK is a world leader in the electric car industry.

‘Plug in vehicles can help the 
consumer by offering a good driving experience and low running costs. 
They can help the environment by cutting pollution. And most importantly
of all, they can help the British economy by creating skilled 
manufacturing jobs in a market that is bound to get bigger.’

Business Minister Michael Fallon said:
‘Today’s announcement will make the consumer environment for plug-in 
vehicles more attractive and, in turn, makes the UK a more compelling 
place to invest.’

John Martin, Nissan’s senior vice 
president for manufacturing, said: ‘We are delighted that the UK 
Government is showing it shares our commitment to the transport of the 
future.’

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and
traders welcomed the move which it said would ‘boost confidence’ in the
electric car market.
