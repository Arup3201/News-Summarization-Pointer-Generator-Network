More British soldiers and veterans committed suicide last year than were killed in battle, it has been reported.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed that in 2012 seven serving soldiers were confirmed to have killed themselves, while a further 14 died in suspected suicides but inquests had yet to be held.

The Government does not record suicides among former soldiers, but an investigation by the BBC's Panorama found at least 29 veterans also took their own lives last year.

The 50 suicides compares with 40 soldiers who died in action in Afghanistan during the same period.

A spokesman for the MoD said suicide among members of the Armed Forces remains 'extremely rare' and is lower than comparative rates in the civilian population.

Panorama said it wrote to every coroner in the country to ask for the names of soldiers and veterans who killed themselves last year and also analysed newspaper reports of coroners' inquests.

Lance Sergeant Dan Collins who survived a bomb blast while serving in Helmand Province in Afghanistan in 2009, killed himself while still a serving soldier on New Year's Eve 2011 after suffering with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, the BBC reported.

His mother Deana told Panorama her son was a 'victim of war' and his name should be added to the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire which honours the military casualties of every conflict since WWII.

'Soldiers with PTSD are exactly the same. They're victims of war and they should be treated exactly the same,' she said.

Commodore Andrew Cameron, chief 
executive of Combat Stress, said: 'Every suicide by a soldier or veteran
is one too many but 50 in one year is desperately sad.

Although figures reveal there were 50 suicides among service personnel and veterans in 2012, the MoD says it remains 'extremely rare'

'Our thoughts go out to the families 
and friends affected. If confirmed, these figures remind us that serving
in the armed forces can be very traumatic and can result in 
psychological as well as physical wounds.

'The priority now needs to be to 
ensure that the NHS must have a greater understanding of how to support 
soldiers and veterans suffering from Service-related mental ill-health.

'The NHS and emergency services are 
generally the first organisations to have contact with a veteran in 
emotional turmoil. We are working with the NHS to increase awareness and
improve responsiveness to veterans who need help and treatment when 
they are in crisis.

'A greater focus should be placed on 
identifying soldiers and veterans suffering in silence with mental 
wounds so they can get the help and support required before it is too 
late.'

An MoD spokesman said: 'Every suicide is a tragedy and our thoughts remain with the families of all those who have sadly taken their own lives.

'Mental health of our personnel and veterans is a top priority for the Government, that is why we have committed Â£7.4 million to ensure there is extensive mental health support in place for everyone who needs it.

The Panorama special, Broken By Battle, will be broadcast on BBC One tomorrow at 9pm.
