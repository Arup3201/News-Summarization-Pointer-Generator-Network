It is a bitter pill to swallow for all of us who enjoy too many fizzy drinks, chocolate and sweets.

Our teeth would be more likely to last the rest of our lives if the world's recommended sugar intake, already only slightly more than one can of Coke, halved to fewer than seven teaspoons a day.

Researchers from Newcastle University found people who gained less than five per cent of their energy from 'free sugars', added artifically to foods and found naturally in juice, honey and syrup, were more likely to end their lives without cavities.

Sweet tooth: Researchers said treats once saved for Christmas are being eaten every day, with harmful results

Professor of nutrition and oral health Paula Moynihan said people are eating sugary foods which used to be a birthday or Christmas treat on a daily basis, the Daily Telegraph reported.

She added: 'People now expect to keep their teeth into old age and, given that the effects of sugars on our teeth are lifelong, limiting sugars to less than five per cent of the calories we eat would minimise the risk of dental cavities throughout life.

'We need to make it easier for people to make healthier choices when it comes to sugars by ensuring that options lower in added sugars are made widely available in schools, shops and the workplace.'

The findings in the Journal of Dental
 Research examined 55 previous studies on the causes of tooth decay, all
 but eight of which showed a link between sugar intake and cavities over
 a person's lifespan.

A 
'significant relationship' was seen between people who ate less than 
five per cent of their calories in sugar - just under seven teaspoons a day for 
women, and just over eight for men.

Sugar: Just one can of Coca Cola would exceed the recommended daily intake of sugar if it was halved

If the new limit was introduced, just one 330ml can of Coca Cola would exceed the limit, with 8.75 teaspoons (35g) of sugar in the UK.

The sweet-toothed among us could just about manage a can of Sprite (5.5 teaspoons) or a bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate (6.4 teaspoons) before reaching the limit.

The data was sourced from trials in countries as far afield as Latin America, the Caribbean, China and South Africa.

However, the research warned that differences between the data quality in the studies meant the results could be unreliable.

It also found that no amount of flouride in drinking water could stop tooth decay, the Telegraph reported.
