The parents of a 14-year-old Utah girl who vanished on her way to school Monday morning are breathing a sigh of relief today after learning that she has been found safe.

Sarah ‘Charice’ Beaumont, of Provo, was last seen at 8.30am as she left home on her way to Dixon Middle School.

The teen never made it to class. Police were notified about her disappearance at around 3.30pm when the girl's parents, Brian and Jennifer Beaumont, discovered that she was not home.

Just before noon Tuesday, her family posted a message on a Facebook page that was created to help in the search letting everyone know that she has been found safe and sound. 

Provo police confirmed this information to MailOnline over the phone. The station KSL reported that the 14-year-old was located in Pleasant Grove over 10 miles away from her home.

Police told the Daily Herald that when Sarah left for school, the teen rode her bike to Pleasant Grove and spent the night in a local church. 

This morning, the 14-year-old knocked on the door of a nearby home, asked to use a phone and called her mother. Provo police alerted Pleasant Grove police about the call, who dispatched officers to the church.

The news comes after multiple search parties spent hours scouring Provo neighborhoods Monday night handing out pictures in an effort to find Sarah.

The girl's loved ones also created a group on Facebook sharing information about the missing persons case and asking for help.

As part of the investigation, police made calls to residents living in the area of Sarah's home neae 1140 West and 650 North to let them known that a child has gone missing.

The girl's family wrote on Facebook that 'she is NOT the type to run away.' The 14-year-old has been described as a straight-A student who enjoys ballroom dancing and has 100 per cent attendance at school.

Sarah Beaumont is 4 feet 8 inches tall, weighing 68lbs with hazel eyes, light brown hair and a fair complexion.
