She said: 'Last week, I tanned Kim Kardashian in her private suite late on Monday night.

'When tanning Kim I chose to use Vita Liberata professional tanning solution in Brazil. This formula offers a rich dark bronze color which is exactly what we were trying to achieve.

Glow getter: Fiona explained that to enhance Kim's 'already beautiful olive skin tone', she used one of the darker Vita Liberata spray tan shades and recommends using the pHenomenal 2-3 Week Tan Lotion, right, for achieving the look at home

Big fan: Kim tweeted a thank you to Fiona, who tanned her in her private suite

Fiona added: 'Everyone in Hollywood knows how to get the most out of their tan… if your skin is healthy, your tan will look natural and will fade perfectly.

'We always advise our Hollywood clients as well as everyone to drink lots of water, eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables like spinach and arugula (rocket in the UK), which will keep your lysine levels high (the active tanning ingredient DHA works better when your Lysine levels are high).

'To prepare your skin for tanning, all of my Hollywood clients are advised to thoroughly exfoliate to get rid of the dead skin cells.

'It is also really important to use soaps containing no creams or essential oils and definitely do not moisturise prior to tanning.'
