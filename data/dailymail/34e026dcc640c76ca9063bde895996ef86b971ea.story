Former astronaut Edgar Mitchell has reluctantly given back the space camera he brought home from his 1971 Apollo 14 moon mission, rather than face a federal lawsuit over its ownership.

The 81-year-old argued the data acquisition camera was a gift from NASA, and earlier this year - four decades after taking it to space - he tried to auction it through the British firm Bonhams.

NASA says the camera is U.S. government property and sued Mr Mitchell to get it back after learning in March the device was up for sale.

Camera battle: NASA forced Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell to hand over the camera which took this picture of him on the moon in 1971

Legal wrangle: Mr Mitchell said the 16mm motion picture camera was a gift from NASA and had put it up for auction with a guide price of $80,000

His for forty years: Mr Mitchell, 81, argued the camera would have been space junk otherwise

In papers filed Thursday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami stated Mr Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the moon, will 'relinquish all claims of ownership, legal title, or dominion' of the 16mm motion picture camera.

Mr Mitchell agreed to allow Bonhams' New York auction house, where the  camera was consigned for sale last June, to release the artifact to the government. Bonhams had estimated the camera's value at $60,000 to $80,000.

Once returned to NASA, the space agency will pass it on to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington for display within 60 days.

Both sides will pay their own legal expenses. A judge was expected to sign off on the settlement in the coming days.

Mitchell’s attorney Armen R. Vartian said his client decided the settlement was the best way to resolve a conflict with NASA.

'I think both sides saw the lawsuit as something that should not continue,' he added.

Mr Mitchell is one of 12 humans to have walked on the moon. He later received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

The
data acquisition cameras (DAC), measuring six inches, by four inches by
two inches, were taken into space to record engineering data and lunar 
surface imagery.

This particular camera was one of two that went to the moon's surface on the Apollo 14 mission, which Mr Mitchell piloted. It shot the final five minutes of the lunar module, named Antares, landing on the moon.

During the mission, Mr Mitchell and Alan Shepard spent hours collecting nearly 100 pounds of lunar samples.

They also demonstrated that astronauts could walk long distances safely, covering about two miles on one expedition. Mr Shepard's attempt at swatting a golf ball on the moon can be viewed on the internet.

The mission plan called for the DACs to 
be left in Antares to save weight aboard the command module, the capsule
that would return the two moonwalkers and pilot Stu Roosa to Earth.

But Mr Mitchell saved the camera and 
brought it back to Earth along with various other spacesuit and 
spacecraft hardware the team chose to keep as mementos.

The
camera remained in Mr Mitchell's possession for 40 years but when he 
tried to sell it, NASA issued a legal suit demanding back the 'exclusive
property of the United States'.

Mr Mitchell countered by referring to a practice in the 1970s that allowed the Apollo astronauts to keep equipment that had not been intended to return from the moon, so long as the items did not exceed weight limitations and were approved by management.

Mr Mitchell argued that if he had not brought it home, the camera would still be space junk, unwanted by NASA.

The government has won out, though, despite never making clear what distinguished the camera from other Apollo-returned hardware.

Since his retirement, Mr Mitchell has devoted much of his life to exploring the mind, physics, the possibility of space aliens and ways of linking religion with scientific fact.
