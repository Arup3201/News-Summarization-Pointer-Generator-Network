Buckingham Palace was adamant yesterday that the Countess of Wessex would not hand back two sets of jewels given to her by a brutal Arab regime.

Despite mounting criticism of the gifts – revealed by the Daily Mail on Saturday – a spokesman said the hugely valuable gems from the ruling family of Bahrain had been accepted as an ‘official gift’.

They were received during the course of the countess’s public duties on behalf of the Queen, which means she is permitted to keep them on behalf of the Crown.

The jewels were given to the countess during a visit she and her husband Prince Edward made to the Arab kingdom shortly before Christmas on the way back from a trip to meet British troops in Afghanistan.

During a banquet on December 21, Sophie was handed one set by the king, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, and another by the country’s prime minister, Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman al Khalifa, who also happens to be the king’s uncle.

Politicians have called on Buckingham Palace to hand the ‘tainted’ gems back.

Labour
MP Paul Flynn said: ‘Bahrain is one of the most oppressive governments 
in the Middle East and it is completely unacceptable for any figure in 
public life to accept gifts of this sumptuous value.’

Details of the jewels emerged in a list of official gifts given to members of the Royal Family last year. It does not include those given to Prince Charles or the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge who compile theirs separately.

Official gifts are not considered to be the personal property of the royal concerned – but are received on behalf of the Queen.

When the recipient dies official 
gifts pass to the monarch who then decides whether they should become 
part of the Royal Collection or lent to their successors.

Among the items mentioned on the list
are a pair of black ear defenders given to the Duke of Edinburgh by the
Royal National Institute for the Deaf, two bags of basmati rice given 
to Prince Andrew from the Pakistan High Commission and a picture painted
by a prisoner at Durham jail which was given to Princess Anne.

The Queen’s list included a stuffed koala bear from a child in Canberra  on her October trip to Australia.
