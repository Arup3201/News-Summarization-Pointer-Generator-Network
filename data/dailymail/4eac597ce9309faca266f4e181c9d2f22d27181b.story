Americans will soon be able to text during domestic flights, but talking is another story.

A vendor that provides in-flight Wi-Fi is reportedly set to launch a service that allows fliers to use their smartphones as if on the ground. Airlines are excited about offering texting, but not too keen on people chatting away during flights.

'The texting service is almost guaranteed to launch, but voice calls may be a harder sell for domestic airlines,' a spokesperson for vendor Gogo told CNBC.

‘There is strong demand for this service and the ability to text in flight,’ Brad Jaehn, vice president, told CNBC. ‘We think a lot of our users will want to have the option to text while in flight.’

The service will work on just about any android or Apple smartphone. Users access it by downloading an app that links to Gogo’s network already in place on over 2,000 planes spanning nine domestic airlines, according to USA Today.

‘We can just turn on the application... on any plane that's already been Gogo-ized,’ a spokesperson told The Verge.

Gogo’s network becomes active when a plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet or more.

The app will able to be downloaded from either the Apple App Store or Google Play, and is available in several different languages, USA Today noted.

Surveys taken by Gogo show strong demand for text messaging during flights, but there has been less enthusiasm about sharing flights with people rambling on their phones from take-off to landing, according to a spokesperson.

‘We see this as more of a text messaging product for commercial airlines in the United States, the phone functionality is something that some international air carriers and our business aviation customers are asking for,’ a spokesperson told The Verge.

Skype and other VOIP services are already blocked from being used on Gogo’s in-flight networks, The Verge noted.

‘Currently in North America our nine airlines partners have no interest in enabling voice calls because of the social stigma that it ultimately introduces,’ the spokesperson told USA Today.

A test flight last week resulted in mixed reviews of the voice call service, but mostly positive impressions of the ability to send text messages, reports said.

Pricing has not yet been hashed out, but it may be similar to the daily, monthly and annual plans offered by Gogo for its in-flight internet service.

The vendor aims to launch the new service in the first quarter of next year, according to reports.
