Jozef Paczynski, 95, has often spoken of his years as a prisoner in Auschwitz - and the terror of cutting camp commander Rudolf Hoess's hair on an almost weekly basis

There are few people who survived more than a few months living in Auschwitz: Jozef Paczynski - who lived for four-and-a-half years within the walls of the death camp, is the exception to the rule.

But in order to do so he had to take a weekly task which terrified him: become the personal barber to camp commander Rudolf Hoess, one of the most cold-blooded and sadistic mass murderers in Adolf Hitler's regime.

In the years after he was rescued, he has had to face one question: why didn't he slit the throat of the man sending hundreds of thousands of innocent people to their deaths at the largest and most notorious Nazi death camp?

His answer has been searingly honest: 'I thought about it. But when I realized what the consequences would be I simply could not do it.'

Jozef, now 95, was just out of his teens when he arrived at the camp's notorious entrance in June 1940. He had been trying to flee Poland, to join the Polish army which was regrouping in France. 

He was arrested after crossing into Slovakia and was taken in the first transport to Auschwitz, becoming prisoner number 121.

The camp had opened just months before, in April, and he was on the first transport with 728 other young people.

Jozef was one of the first prisoners to arrive at Aushwtiz (pictured), and was able to get himself a job in the barbers

Because they were the first, there were managerial jobs on offer - and Jozef found a role for himself in the barbers shop, where the SS men used to get their hair cut.

And then, one day, Hoess himself showed up and ordered the 'small Pole' — 'der kleine Pole' — to come to his home.

It was with terror that Jozef went to the villa on the outskirts of the camp, escorted by a guard.

'Hoess' wife let me in the house,' he told an audience in Poland last month.

'My voice was shaking, my hands were shaking and my legs were shaking.

'His wife led me to the first floor and into a bathroom. There was a mirror and a chair and within a moment Hoess arrived. He didn't speak a word to me. 

'But I said 'bitte schoen' to him and he sat down and I cut his hair.'

In fact, Hoess would never speak a word to the man who would cut his hair until 1944.

But he was soon asked to cut the hair of the commander, making regular trips to Hoess's home on the outskirts of the camp

Jozef witnessed people being rounded up and gassed, watching from the barbers - which was next door to the crematorium. Pictured: Women in Auschwitz the day it was liberated

But he obviously felt Jozef did a good job, getting him to return every seven to 10 days. Even after he was sent to Berlin, Hoess would always ask for a haircut from 'der kleine Pole' when he arrived back at Auschwitz.

All the time, though, Jozef knew what was happening in the camp. He had been told, when he arrived, that the guards didn't expect people to live more than three months - and even less for Jews.

More horrifying for Jozef, who had been a captain in the Polish army, was the fact the barbers shop was next door to the crematorium.

He has, in the years since, described watching the guards at work - pushing the herded people into the cell, before one of them began pouring powder into an opening. Tellingly, he was wearing a gas mask.

Speaking in Germany 10 years ago, he recalled: 'Although the walls were very thick, I could hear loud screams from there. It lasted 15 minutes, then after, complete silence. 

'Two engines were put to work on the sidewalk at the fullest so the screams would not be heard.' 

Yet still, he did not move to kill the evil commander ordering the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. 

He decided not to kill Hoess - pictured here after he was captured following the war - because he thought the implications for his family and the camp would be too severe

Ten years ago, he elaborated on his reasons why.  

'All my family and half of the camp would be killed,' CNN reported him as saying. 

'And of course I realised if this silent son of a bitch would go, there will be another man who will take his place.' 

But Jozef was also privy to another side of the murderous camp commander - who was, he believed, 'an ideal father and an ideal husband'.

'He was a man of very few words,' Jozef said. 'And he would never actually hit a prisoner.'

Jozef eventually left the confines of Auschwitz on January 18, 1945 - moved out by the Nazis days before the Soviet army liberated the camp.

He had to wait to be freed - finally being liberated by U.S. soldiers in Germany. 

As for Hoess, he was tried by Polish authorities after the fall of Germany.

He was found guilty of murder after a year on the run, and hung next to the crematorium where he had put so many to death in April 1947.
