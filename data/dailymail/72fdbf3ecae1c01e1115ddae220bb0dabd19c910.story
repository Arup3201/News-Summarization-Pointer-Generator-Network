Spain coach Vicente del Bosque will be counting on Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas to help his country qualify for Euro 2016 despite their absence for upcoming games.

Both players have excelled since joining Chelsea this summer but neither is fully fit and unable to help in Saturday's qualifier against Belarus and the friendly at home to Germany three days later.

Unlike Costa, Fabregas, who has scored two goals and set up another 11 in 15 appearances for Chelsea, was included in Del Bosque's squad.

Cesc Fabregas has been ruled out of Spain's games against Belarus and Germany over the next week 

The Chelsea midfielder was spotted at a party at Sushi Samba in London on Tuesday

Fabregas, who has been superb this season, has a hamstring problem but shouldn't be missing for too long

However, the 27-year-old midfielder was ruled out with a hamstring problem after undergoing a check-up in Madrid earlier this week.

'We had to wait a few days to evaluate Cesc's injury and we opted for him not to continue with us,' Del Bosque said to Spanish radio station Onda Cero. 'At times we have been flexible but not in this case.

'His muscle seems all right but he complains and he is the best doctor.

'I prefer to be deceived but I cannot be distrustful.

'When a player of his calibre tells you that he is injured, you have to believe him.'

Costa was left out of Del Bosque's latest selection in order to rest.

The Brazilian-born striker missed four matches for Chelsea through injury after scoring his first goal for Spain in last month's 4-0 triumph over Luxembourg.

'In our previous training camp, he (Costa) complained about pain in his pelvic bone,' Del Bosque said. 'I thought it was best for him to take a break.

'It's not a sign of weakness, I don't want to confront anyone.

Diego Costa is also ruled out, but the Chelsea striker hadn't been selected in the 23-man squad 

Manager Vicente del Bosque said Spain weren't willing to push Costa to the limit in playing him again

'When I gave my 23-man squad, I knew that he (Costa) was going to play with his club at the weekend.

'But we cannot push someone when they don't feel completely well.

'He is the first one that has asked us to please not forget him when I make my next squad selection in February.'

Costa, who has scored 10 goals in nine Premier League appearances for Chelsea so far, is eager to shine for Spain.

The former Atletico Madrid star became a naturalised player earlier this year and has found the back of the net just once in seven appearances for La Roja since.

However, Del Bosque is confident Costa will have a starring role for the national team despite his slow start.

'For whatever reason, he (Costa) has not been 100 per cent with us,' he said. 'However, we cannot say that he has not given all of his enthusiasm, he has always had a desire to play.

'We haven't been lucky, he has been a slave of our lack of play.

'Had we not opted to select him (naturalise him), now we would have thrown our hands in the air.

'Seeing how Costa moves, the spaces he finds, this cannot be bad for any team.

'Perhaps he is not as technical but not all forwards need to be in order to score goals.'

Defending European champions Spain head into Friday's home match against Belarus in second place in Group C with six points from three games. They are three points adrift of leaders Slovakia.
