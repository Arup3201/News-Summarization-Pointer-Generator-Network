In what could be seen as a serious blow to smartphone rival Apple, Google and Samsung have signed a deal to share and use each others patents.

The global deal covers existing patents, as well as any that will be filed by either firm during the next decade.

It is unclear exactly which patents will be covered by the agreement, although a statement from Samsung said it covers a 'broad range of technologies and business areas.'

Google and Samsung have signed a global deal to share and use each others patents for the next decade. The firms already have a working relationship because Samsung phones, including the Galaxy S4 pictured left, run on a skinned version of Google's Android operating system, seen on Google's Nexus 5, right

'This agreement with Google is highly significant for the 
technology industry,' said Dr. Seungho Ahn, the head of Samsungâ€™s intellectual property centre.

'Samsung and Google are showing the rest 
of the industry that there is more to gain from cooperating than 
engaging in unnecessary patent disputes.'

Recent patent disputes include the high court battles between Samsung and Apple concerning a wide variety of alleged patent infringements, from both sides, as well as previous disputes between Apple and HTC, and arguments between Samsung and Ericsson.

Samsung and Google already have a working relationship because Samsung's phones, tablets and smartwatch run on a skinned version of Google's Android operating system.

Google recently acquired smart smoke alarm and thermostat company Nest, pictured, and with Samsung's increasing range of smart kitchen appliances and white goods, there may well be a crossover with patents in the home under this global patent deal

The partnership could therefore help cement Android's market share ahead of Apple's iOS.

This suggests the two firms' respective smartphone patents will feature high on the list of concepts to share.

Elsewhere, Google is said to be working on a smartwatch to rival Samsung's Galaxy Gear, and the firm may take advantage of a number of Samsung patents relating to wearables.

Samsung has gone back to the drawing board for its second-generation Galaxy Gear smartwatch after sales of the original model, pictured, were slow. Reports from Korea claim the Galaxy Gear 2 will replace the chunky flat screen of the original with a curved OLED display and is set to look 'totally different'

This isn't the first cross-patent deal between major smartphone manufacturers.

In November 2012, Apple and HTC signed a ten-year licensing agreement, however, this was signed in order to settle the lawsuits the companies had with each other in various regions around the world.

The two companies said the agreement would cover current and future patents for both firms, yet didn't expand further.

Similarly, many smartphone manufacturers already work together in various other guises to share innovation or expertise.

For example, LG made Google's Nexus 5 device, while Asus made its Nexus 7. Samsung has also been involved in the manufacturing of chips used in a number of Apple products.
