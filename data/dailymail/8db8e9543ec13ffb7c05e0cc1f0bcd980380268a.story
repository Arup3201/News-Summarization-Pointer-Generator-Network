Three Democratic lawmakers asked President Barack Obama on Thursday to ban travelers from the West
African countries hit hardest by the Ebola virus from entering the U.S. until the
outbreak of the disease is under control.

Democratic Reps. Alan Grayson, Kyrsten Sinema, Dave Loebsack and 23 Republicans in the House of Representatives sent a letter to Obama calling on him to direct the State Department
to impose a travel ban and restrict visas issued to citizens of
Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

In the letter, dated Oct. 8, they also asked U.S. health and
border control officials to consider quarantine for anyone who
arrives from the affected nations after being exposed to Ebola
until 21 days have passed, the period in which they would show
signs of the illness.

'We note that Congressman Grayson made this request to your administration in July, and that 27 African countries already have taken such action to protect their on citizens, but the United States inexplicably has not,' the letter states.

The lawmakers go on to say Obama should not wait for the World Health Organization to dictate how U.S. authorities should proceed. 

'The WHO is an organization of unelected bureaucrats and political appointees of foreign countries,' they wrote. 'It has no duty to protect the lives and well-being of Americans, as you do.

'Furthermore, it has utterly failed to stem this epidemic through its own action,' they added. 

The letter was released a day after the death of the first
person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, a Liberian man
 who traveled from his home country on Sept. 19 and died in an
isolation ward of a Dallas, Texas hospital.

The case put authorities and the public on alert for the
deadly virus and the government increased efforts to try and
stop it from spreading outside West Africa. 

'Since there is no effective means to identify asymptomatic travelers who harbor the disease, often unknowingly, only a temporary travel ban...can prevent the further spread of Ebola to the United States,'  Grayson, a Democrat from Florida, said in a statement on Thursday.

In the same statement Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, a Republican who signed the letter, said the the U.S. 'must do all we can to protect our country from infection while aiding in the effort to combat this deadly disease.'

'Taking necessary action to protect our citizens is paramount and is the sole responsibility of the United States government; not the U.N. or the WHO,' he added.

U.S. health authorities on Wednesday announced they would
begin enhanced screening of travelers for fever from the
affected countries at five major airports after resisting earlier demands from federal lawmakers to beef up security measures.

The Ebola virus has killed nearly 4,000 people in Sierra
Leone, Liberia and Guinea since March in the largest outbreak on
record. It causes hemorrhagic fever and is spread through direct
contact with body fluids from an infected person. 

The U.S. Defense Department won permission to shift $750 million in war funds to fight Ebola in West Africa as a Republican senator on Friday lifted his remaining objections to the transfer.

The action by Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma will give the Pentagon enough funding for about six months of operations in West Africa, including the deployment of up to 4,000 troops and the establishment some 17 Ebola treatment facilities with 100 beds each. 

'After careful consideration, I believe that the outbreak has reached a point that the only organization in the world able to provide the capabilities and speed necessary to respond to this crisis is the U.S. military,' Inhofe said in a statement. 

The representatives who wrote to Obama on Thursday made it clear that they support 'all efforts to provide humanitarian relief' to West Africa. 

Simply put, the lawmakers said, they just want the president and his administration to take 'commonsense steps to protect U.S. citizens from this Ebola epidemic.'
