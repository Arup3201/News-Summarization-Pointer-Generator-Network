The devout Christian Duggar daughters who charm viewers with their naive antics on TLC's 19 Kids and Counting, have revealed that they avoid spending time with men in case they sin and have sex before marriage.

In their new tell-all book titled Growing Up Duggar, the eldest girls - Jana, 24, Jill, 22, Jessa, 21, and Jinger, 20 - explain that 'it’s easy to put yourself into physical and moral danger and give into those emotions or sensual thoughts that promise pleasant, but only temporary, fulfillment.'

Even when they are alone, the siblings from Arkansas say they 'control' what's going on in their minds, adding: 'By censoring our thoughts through the filter of God’s word, we will be able to recant any wrong thoughts or temptations that try to sneak in.'

Growing pains: The devout Christian Duggar daughters open up about courtship, eating disorders and sibling rivalry in new tell-all book titled Growing Up Duggar

They all say that they 'have a natural physical desire toward men' and 'thank God for making us "normal."'

Jessa is currently the only one out of the foursome who is courting. It was revealed last month that she is seeing fellow church-goer, Ben Seewald, and the two stick to traditional religious dating rules.

They avoid physical contact completely, only 'side hugging' briefly to say hello or goodbye, and kissing will be saved for their wedding day.

'All of us have 
gone through times when we’ve felt we need to lose weight'

Elsewhere in their book the Duggar 
sisters open up about eating disorders and moments of rage, making it 
clear that what goes on behind closed doors is very different from what 
people see on TV.

Addressing the subject of body image, they write: 'You
 may think that kids like the Duggars, who are homeschooled and don’t 
watch TV or read secular magazines, are immune from feelings like that, 
but we’re not!'

'We’ve experienced some of those same negative feelings about the girl 
in the mirror that you may be feeling right now or have felt in the 
past.

Young love: Jessa, who is currently courting Ben Seewald (left), says she became increasingly introvert as a young teenager because she felt 'really insecure' about the way she looked, dressed, and acted

'All of us have 
gone through times when we’ve felt we need to lose weight,' they admit.

They also reveal how sibling rivalry is a constant problem in such a large household.

In
 one passage, Jill recounts one particular incident where she felt like a
 'total loser' at the side of her younger, more fashionable, sister 
Jessa.

'I can remember a Sunday morning when we were getting
 ready for church and I went through multiple outfit changes because I 
was trying to measure up.

'The night before, I had stood in our closet 
for at least ten minutes trying to decide what I would wear the next 
day. (Ever been there?)

'I had friends who were really 
beautiful, and whenever we were together I compared myself to them and 
always came up lacking something'

'Finally I chose an outfit I thought was 
suitable. I took it upstairs and laid it out so it would be ready the 
next morning. But when I walked out of the bathroom Sunday morning, 
dressed and ready to go, I noticed how great Jessa looked wearing an 
adorable outfit she had recently found at a thrift store.

'Plus, she had 
the cutest aviator sunglasses perched on her head and a stylish leather 
bag slung over her shoulder.

'Suddenly the outfit I had chosen for myself
 the night before seemed totally wrong. I wanted to look as cute as 
Jessa did.'

But Jessa says she 
also had her own issues to deal with. As a young teenager she said she became increasingly introvert because she felt 'really insecure' about the way she looked, dressed, and acted.

'I had friends who were really beautiful, and whenever we were together I compared myself to them and always came up lacking something,' she said, recounting feelings of jealousy.

Coming
 clean: The four eldest Duggar daughters also detail their mother's bulimia 
struggle in their new book

Full to capacity! The four girls say that having so many siblings causes friction at home

'I felt so ashamed and awkward that I
 couldn’t even talk to anyone about my feelings. I felt overwhelmed and 
stuck in that negative mind-set.'

All of the Duggar girls are known for their conservative dress sense, with shorts skirts, pants and strappy tops strictly off limits.

However, they show their glam girl side with the help of make-up and spend time tending their long tresses.

They also open up about discovering the baby their mother was pregnant with in 2011 had died in the womb.

'We were stunned. Speechless,' they explain. 'The baby brother or sister we had so looked forward to holding and playing with …was gone.

'There was no holding back the tears as Mom shared the story of how the technician had started the ultrasound, how she had looked and looked at the screen, how she had paused and turned to them, looking so sad, and said, "I'm so sorry." The doctor had confirmed there was no heartbeat.'

In their new book they look at other family members with skeletons lurking in their closets, 
including their mother's 'dangerous' battle with bulimia and their father's inherited anger issues.

The Duggars first entered the 
spotlight in 2008 on TLC's show 17 and Counting - a series which 
followed the life of Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17 - now 19 - 
children

The family is 
conservative Christian and has strong beliefs about issues such as 
contraception, home-schooling, and spending very little time on the 
internet or watching TV.

They
 are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement which 'teaches
 that children are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should 
happily welcome every child they are given.'

Addressing
 their critics, Mr Duggar once said: 'People think we are overpopulating
 the world [but] we are following our convictions.'
