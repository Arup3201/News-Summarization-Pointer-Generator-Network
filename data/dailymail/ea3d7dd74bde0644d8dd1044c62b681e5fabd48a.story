A sheriff's deputy who dragged a mentally incompetent woman through a courthouse hallway by the shackles around her ankles is under investigation.

Attorney Bill Gelin recorded the deputy dragging 28-year-old Dasyl Jeanette Rios down a third-floor hallway Monday morning in Broward County, Florida.  

Broward Sheriff Scott Israel questioned the conduct of Deputy Christopher Johnson and said the agency's internal affairs unit would investigate his behavior.

Dragged: Dasyl Rios, 28, was taken down a hallway with her ankle shackles by Deputy Christopher Johnson

Pleading: The Broward County deputy began dragging the woman after she wanted to talk to her mother following a court appearance

Screaming: The woman was found mentally incompetent to stand trial right before she was dragged away yelling that she was being hurt and didn't want to go get beat up

Johnson, who has been with the force for 27 years, has now been reassigned to desk duty and will have no contact with inmates during the investigation, according to Local 10.

'My only concern is that the deputy might have had other options,'  Israel said. 'He could've gone through a different course and performed it a different way,' Israel said.

The woman sobbed and pleaded with the deputy during the ordeal.. 

'You're hurting me. You're (expletive) hurting me. Stop. You don't give nobody a chance,' she said while being dragged.

She had just been found mentally incompetent to face trial in a probation violation case, and wanted to speak with her mother after appearing in court.

'All I wanted to do was sob for a few, cry. That's all wanted to do was cry for a few minutes because my life is in your hands,' she said.

'I'm not going back to get beat up,' Rios said repeatedly.

Surrounded by officers and bailiffs, she tried to hang on to a nearby signpost before being dragged away from the court. 

Officials say Rios, had argued with a female deputy when Johnson came up to her when she was sitting on a bench.

Rios's mother Sylvia was gathering up her things when she heard a noise from the hallway and watched as her daughter was dragged away screaming, according to the New York Daily News. 

'I realized they were doing something to my child... I don't think I'm ever going to get over this,' the mother, an assistant principal at a local high school, said. 

Johnson wrote in his report 'Fearing she would cause a commotion in the public area, I then physically grabbed inmate Rios by her leg restraints and pulled her back to the D10-door.'

That would have meant dragging her down three hallways, according to the Sun Sentinel.  

A supplemental report said that Rios twice refused to walk.

Gelin captured the incident, which drew a crowd of around 50 people, on video.

'They could have had a wheelchair, they could have had a stretcher, they could have had somebody with just the slightest bit of compassion,' the lawyer said.

Mr Gelin's wife, Chief Assistant Public Defender Lynn Desanti heard the inmate's cries when she was walking in the courthouse. 

'I could hear screaming, and I could see a deputy yelling at somebody, and all I could hear was, 'If you don't get up, I'm going to drag you,''' she told WSVN. 

She said the officer should be arrested for dragging the woman. 

Rios is now at a mental health hospital. Her mother says that they will think about what to do next after making sure she is OK.

The incident follows another videotaped interaction with police in Broward County, where Fort Lauderdale Officer Victor Ramirez pushed and slapped a homeless man before arresting him.
