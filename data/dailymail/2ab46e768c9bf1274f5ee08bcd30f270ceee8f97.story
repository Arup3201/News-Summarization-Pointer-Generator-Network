For the first time, Nasa has tested one of the explosively powerful boosters that will help its Space Launch System rocket reach space in 2019, and eventually take humans to Mars.

The 126-second static-fire test took place in Utah today at 11:30am EDT (3:30pm GMT).

Temperatures reached 2,500°C (4,500°F) - enough to melt  sand on the site into glass - as 3.6 million pounds of thrust poured out of the engine.

Nasa has tested one of the boosters for the Space Launch System in Utah. That static-fire test (seen in the animation above) took place at 3:30pm GMT and lasted 126 seconds. The 3.6 million pounds of thrust produced temperatures of 2,500°C. When SLS eventually flies, two of these boosters will be used

This was the first test of the redesigned booster for SLS. When it ultimately flies, it will use two of these Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB).

There will be two versions of the rocket.

The smaller, 70-metric-ton SLS will stand 321ft (98 metres) tall, provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload.

The massive 130-metric-ton-configuration will be the most capable, powerful launch vehicle in history.

Towering a staggering 384ft (117 metres) tall, it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds.

It will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit. 

In its final configuration the SLS will be the most powerful rocket ever launched, more powerful even than the Saturn V rocket that took men to the moon.

During the test, flames exited the nozzle at about Mach 3.

The booster itself is an upgraded version of the same one that took the Space Shuttle into orbit, but it has an additional section to allow more fuel, and thus more power, to be added.

Known as Qualification Motor 1, the booster spent several days inside a chamber as it was heated up to a core temperature of 32°C (90°F).

It measures 117 ft (54 metres) in length, 12.2ft (3.7 metres) in diameter and has a total mass of around 725 metric tons.

Shown are engineers at Orbital ATK preparing to test the largest, most powerful booster ever built for Nasa's new rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), which fired up for a ground test today at Orbital ATK Propulsion Systems’ test facilities in Promontory, Utah

The test was run by Nasa in tandem with the rocket propulsion company Orbital ATK.

Former astronaut and vice president for Advanced Strategic Programs at ATK Charles Precourt said after the event that it was a ‘really nice result’.

He added: ‘It looked really clean and was very exciting. You could see the pressure coming off the motor.’

Nasa's booster manager Alex Priskos added: 'We couldn't be happier with what we know so far. Today was about as successful as you can get'

Towering a staggering 384ft (117 metres) tall, the Space Launch System (SLS) will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds when it eventually takes flight.

It will be used to take astronauts to Mars sometime in the 2030s, with Nasa’s Orion spacecraft being carried on top.
