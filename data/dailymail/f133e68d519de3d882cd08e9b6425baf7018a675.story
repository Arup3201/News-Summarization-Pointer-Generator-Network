Tory MPs last night urged David Cameron to seize back from Brussels up to 130 powers over crime and policing.

In a show of strength, more than 100 Conservative MPs have written to the Prime Minister urging him to return control over a range of contentious crime measures to Westminster.

The intervention steps up pressure on Mr Cameron to take a tough stance on Europe, despite the concerns of his Liberal Democrat Coalition colleagues.

The letter, signed by former Cabinet ministers John Redwood and Peter Lilley and the current chairman of the party’s powerful 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, warns that Britain has just two years to ‘opt out’ of the measures before they become irreversible.

Powers at stake include the European Arrest Warrant, which has seen more than 200 British nationals handed over to prosecutors in other EU states. 

Use of the power has brought accusations of false arrest, alarmed civil liberties groups and led to warnings that it is a major step towards establishing a single European prosecutor.

MPs are also demanding action to remove the UK from a requirement that police share DNA and fingerprint data with other European police forces – another measure that has alarmed civil liberties campaigners.

In their letter to the Prime Minister, published in the Daily Telegraph, they state: ‘We should maintain our national standards of justice and democratic control over crime and policing – but let other nations integrate more closely if they wish.

‘We do not wish to subordinate UK authorities to a pan-European Public Prosecutor.

‘We do not want to see British police forces subjected to mandatory demands by European police under the European Investigation Order.’

Eurosceptic Tories want Mr Cameron to exploit a clause in the 2009 Lisbon Treaty that gives Britain a one-off opportunity to opt out of a range of measures on justice and home affairs.

They warn that unless he takes the step by June 2014, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg could insist Britain enforces them.

The letter was organised by MPs Dominic Raab and Charlie Elphicke, who insist their aim is to assist Mr Cameron.

Mr Elphicke said: ‘Euro crimes, Euro police and Euro prosecutors are not right for the UK because our criminal system is so different. The pragmatic thing would be to opt out of the lot. We can always opt in at a later date because it is the right thing to do for Britain.’

Mr Raab added: ‘The last thing the UK needs is the European Courts of Justice in Luxembourg doing for British crime and policing what the Strasbourg court has done for human rights.’
