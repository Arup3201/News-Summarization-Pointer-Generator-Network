Temperatures may be yet to hit double figures this April but YouTube blogger Emily Hartridge has  already left winter behind.

She optimistically dedicates this week's Ten Reasons Why to the new season with her latest post, Why We Love Spring.

A tough topic to sell in given the freezing temperatures outside, she enlists the help of handsome Welsh ITV The Hub presenter Matt Johnson, 30, to play her pretend boyfriend.

In the new offering Emily, from London, outlines such springtime benefits as women starting to wear less clothes ('You will enjoy this is you are a man or lesbian'), and the fact that we can eat copious amounts of chocolate at Easter.

But despite her enthusiasm, the first reason she gives in support of spring is shrouded in sarcasm: 'Winter is over, spring is here, the air is getting warmer... (is it f***),' she says.

'For those of you watching that live in the UK you now that we haven't seen spring yet.'

Emily and Matt's role play involves the couple, kitted out in bikinis, beach shorts and sunglasses, leaving the house to go to the beach.

However upon being hit by the reality of the temperatures Matt seizes up in shock and Emily demands: 'It's freezing, can we go inside?'

Reason two is the fact that women start wearing less clothes - one to be enjoyed 'if you are a man or lesbian'.

Other reasons include the fact that feet are liberated: you can 'finally get out those sandals out and let your feet breathe'. This point is illustrated by Matt appearing in the sitting room ready for an outing wearing bright white socks and flip flops together.

Matt, whose feet are free, wears white socks and flip flops together, but think his jeans aren't quite right

Emily gives him a horrified, confused look, and Matt responds: 'It's the jeans isn't it?'.

Next, and this is arguably the most convincing of all, is the fact that those of us who celebrate Easter spend the entire time 'ramming as much chocolate down our throats as possible'.

To illustrate the point, Matt and Emily gorge on chocolate eggs in front of the television, hiding away and even in bed.

And as many of us return to work after a chilly Easter weekend chomping chocolate, that's one element of spring we can relate to.

1. 'Winter is over, spring is here, the air is getting warmer... (is it f***)'.

2. Women start wearing less clothes. One to be enjoyed 'If you are a man or lesbian'.

3. Your feet are free, and you can 'finally get out those sandals out and let your feet breathe'.

4. Those of us who celebrate Easter spend the entire time 'ramming as much chocolate down our throats as possible.

5. Love is in the air, the sun is out (not in the UK) birds are chirping (they're crying in the UK) and the flowers are blooming (they're dying in the UK) - what better time of the year to declare your love to your crush?

6. Spring probably means we're all going to be hornier which can only be a good thing, right?

7. Couples start thinking about where to go away in the summer. Booking a holiday is exciting as you've got something to look forward to. Think of all those memories you're creating together!

8. In spring you can start to walk places instead of driving. Well, Matt can walk *jumps on piggy back*.

9. 'In winter I do love sitting in cosy pub next to a log fire with a bottle of red wine. In spring we can start thinking about sitting outside and having drink.' (Don't take your cue from Matt)

10. There's lots of bank holidays around spring time. 'For some of you that means you get to laze around, watch movies and chill out. Not on my watch!'
