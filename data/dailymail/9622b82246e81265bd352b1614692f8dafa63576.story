The American dentist who last week lost his $34,000 legal action against British Airways after he and his partner were flown to Grenada in the Caribbean instead of Granada in Spain has spoken out.

Dr. Edward Gamson flew from Washington DC to London in September of 2013 and instead of fulfilling his life-long dream of visiting the medieval city boarded a flight right back across the Atlantic after a ticketing mistake.

'I had a conference in Lisbon, Portugal, and I saw that as my opportunity to finally get to Spain,' said Dr. Gamson, of North Bethesda, Maryland, to ABC News. 'I had always wanted to see the Alhambra in Granada, Spain.'

However, Gamson and his partner realized to their horror 20 minutes into their connecting flight that they were not flying southwards from London, back west.

'Within 20 minutes of departing … we look at this little monitor in front of us, and the plane’s heading west, so I go up to the flight attendant and said, ‘Why west? Why not south? We’re going to Spain,’ Gamson recalled.

'He said, ‘Spain, what are you talking about? We’re going to Grenada. We’re in the West Indies,’ and my heart just dropped.'

British Airways had allocated them incorrect tickets for their journey and even though Grenada was clearly written out, Gamson claims he didn't notice because he was on vacation.

'We had just flown across the Atlantic first class and really enjoyed it. I think just my mindset was like, ‘Just lay back, and don’t think about it,’ said Gamson to ABC News.

Once they arrived in the Caribbean, Gamson and his partner hoped on a flight to Miami and from Miami they flew to London and eventually made it to Grenada.

The couple spent three days flying on seven flights and spent $2,2776.

'When I booked the trip, with British Airways, not only was I specific on city and country, but I even gave airport codes,' he said.

'And I certainly had no way of anticipating that there could be a booking agent who didn’t know the difference between the West Indies and Spain.'

In the aftermath of the ticketing mix up, Gamson sued British Airways for $34,000 based on the cost of the extra first class flights he paid for and the lost time in salary for when he would have been working.

However, a court in Washington dismissed the case last week.

British Airways told ABC News that they had tried to make up for the unfortunate error and the court was satisfied they had.

'British Airways is focused on providing exceptional service to all its customers,' the statement said.

'As a goodwill gesture we offered Mr. Gamson and his companion new flights to Granada, Spain, which they declined.

'Instead they accepted free-of-charge flights to an alternate destination and enough Avios frequent flyer points for them to book another trip in the future.

'The customers also continued to pursue a legal case against British Airways, which was dismissed by the court in Washington D.C. last week.'

Gamson denies that British Airways ever made this offer.

Gamson told a British newspaper in June of his disappointment: ‘I have a lifelong interest in Islamic art. I’m also of Spanish Jewish heritage so it was something I had always wanted to do to visit Granada and the Alhambra. I made it absolutely clear to the booking agent I wanted to go to Granada in Spain. Why on earth would I want to go to Grenada in the Caribbean if I was flying back to America from Lisbon?

‘It’s just so sad. A trip we had been really looking forward to was ruined and ... BA won’t do the decent thing.’
