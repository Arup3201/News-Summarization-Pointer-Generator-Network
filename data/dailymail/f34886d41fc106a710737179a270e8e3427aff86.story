Game of Thrones fans are forking out up to $150 for their chance to sit on the Iron Throne.

The Sydney exhibition for the fantasy show is free of charge, but fans are paying strangers to hold their place in line for up to eight hours.

Since the $1 million exhibition officially opened only four days ago, ads have appeared on skill sourcing website Airtasker offering people cash to pay their debts in exchange for enduring the hours-long wait in the queue.

According to the Museum of Contemporary Art website, the average wait time for punters is about six hours.

'[US television network] HBO are encouraging people to arrive early but be prepared for a long wait,' it said.

In fact, the exhibit proved to be so popular that organisers extended opening hours from 10am until 10pm on Thursday and Friday in an attempt to meet demand.

But fans do not seem phased by the long delay.

'Ten bloody hours of wait was worth it #GoTExhibit,' @anjaysay tweeted.

And @carolineenguyen agreed: 'The wait for #GOTExhibit at Sydney was SOOOOOOO worth it!!'

But it wasn't the only excitement in the line.

'Heard one guy proposed to his girlfriend after getting into #GOTExhibit yesterday. They probably met in the queue,' @mjonesy_87 tweeted.

The hugely popular television show is based on a fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, by US author George R. R. Martin.
