A tourism boss has told of her dismay at the return of a real-life Basil Fawlty to TV screens this summer.

Hapless Mark Jenkins was the star of the series The Hotel, which showed his eccentric leadership of a hotel in Torquay – the setting for John Cleese’s legendary comedy character.

His flamboyant and bizarre antics at The Grosvenor Hotel were watched by an average of 2.8 million people when the fly-on-the-wall programme aired on Channel 4 over three series.

The re-emergence of Mark Jenkins in a fourth series of The Hotel fills Carolyn Custerson, the chairman of VisitDevon, with dread. She certainly does not believe that all publicity is good publicity

But now the local tourism chief is annoyed at the news that the cameras are back to film a fourth series - this time with Mr Jenkins as an entertainments manager at the rival Cavendish Hotel.

Carolyn Custerson, the chief executive of the English Riviera Tourism Company and chairman of VisitDevon said: ‘I am personally disappointed to hear that Channel 4 are making another series of The Hotel this summer in Torquay.

‘In my professional opinion I believe that the programme to date has portrayed Torquay hotel standards in an unbalanced way which is unhelpful, particularly when Torquay has just been voted the top seaside destination in the country by Trip Advisor’s Travellers' Choice Awards.

‘I have never believed in all publicity being good publicity.’

Although The Cavendish has confirmed it has signed the deal with Channel 4, the hotel’s owners have been sworn to secrecy and declined to comment on the individual characters.

Manager Richard Blagden said: ‘Contracts were exchanged this week. We weren’t allowed to talk about it until then.

‘They are coming in July. I think they will be here for six weeks.’

He added: ‘This will, hopefully, be good for business. Anything that puts Torbay on the map is good news.

‘The show will probably be screened next January, so we will hopefully get a boost early season next year.

‘We have already started to get more bookings since word got out.’
