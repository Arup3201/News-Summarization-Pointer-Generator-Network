Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for two teenagers who allegedly stabbed a classmate to death after they watched movies together - simply because they wanted to kill and rob him.

Timothy Mosley, 19, and Austin Myers, 19, allegedly tried to choke Justin Back, 18, at his home in Waynesville, Ohio in January before stabbing him, shooting his body and dumping it under a bridge.

A grand jury released nine indictments against the two teens on Monday and Warren County Prosecutor David Fornshell said he will be seeking the death penalty due to the cruelty of the killing.

'They set out to do this,' Fornshell said, Cincinnati.com reported. 'We believe it to be a situation where they simply wanted 
to kill and rob Justin Back.'

'Killers': Timothy Mosley, left, and Austin Myers, right, both 19, allegedly choked and stabbed an 18-year-old classmate before shooting his body and dumping it beneath a bridge. They could face the death penalty

Moseley and Myers, who is listed as homeless in court records, visited the home Back - who was just days away from leaving for the Navy - shared with his parents in Wayne County on January 27 so they could prepare for the robbery.

They then allegedly bought supplies so that they could make a 'clean kill', the told investigators.

The duo returned to Back's home the following afternoon and watched movies with him before attacking him in the kitchen, trying to choke him and stabbing him repeatedly, investigators said.

They then allegedly took a gun, a safe and some of their victim's clothing to make it look like he had run away from home.

Myers allegedly shot Back's corpse with the gun and then the pair dumped his body beneath a bridge in Preble County, investigators said.

Victim: Justin Back (pictured above), who had attended high school with Myers before graduating in 2013, had just joined the Navy and was two weeks away from moving to Illinois for training

Distraught: Back''s parents (pictured with Justin, second right, and one of his brothers) are in support of the death penalty for the suspects, the county sheriff said

Back's parents returned to the home and alerted police after finding items destroyed or missing and no sign of their son, who was about to move away for Naval training.

Investigations uncovered that a violent robbery had taken place at the home and that Mosley and Myers had been there a day earlier. They were arrested and admitted to the killing. They are being held in the Warren County Jail on $1 million bonds.

The indictments include two counts of aggravated murder, counts of aggravated robbery and burglary, grand theft of a firearm, tampering with evidence, safecracking and abuse of a corpse.

Fornshell said he believes the grand jury included multiple death penalty specifications in the indictment due to teenagers' alleged premeditation.

Warren County Sheriff Larry Sims added to the news site that he was pleased the death penalty is being sought. The decision was made with the support of the Back family, he said.

Scene: Although the suspects tried to make it look as if Back had run away, investigators believed a violent robbery had taken place at the home in Waynesville, Ohio

'The family is still reeling from this and they will be for quite some time,' Sims said.

'It's just going to be a long time for the family to move forward to some degree. I can't imagine too many things worse than what they've gone through.'

Justin Back, who leaves behind two brothers and three sisters, had worked at a local McDonalds for three years before graduating from high school in 2013, his obituary said.

He had been classmates with Myers at Waynesville High School.

He had joined the Navy just before his death and was going to leave in two weeks for Recruit Training Command at Great Lakes, Illinois.
