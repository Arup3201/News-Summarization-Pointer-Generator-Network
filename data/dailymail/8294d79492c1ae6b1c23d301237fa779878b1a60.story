A week after learning that half of the people in England are actually of German descent, their Tuetonic cousins have branded them as telly-obsessed, alcoholic hooligans with bad dental hygiene and a love of casual sex and trashy celebrities.

Readers of tabloid newspaper, Bild, were asked 'How English Are You?' in a multiple choice quiz.

The paper concluded that the English are fat lager louts and next to a quiz displayed pictures of a fat skinhead with sunburn dressed in Union Jack shorts.

Pippa or pizza? The English, so say the Germans, are obsessed with them

One of the quiz questions was: 'When you hear the word "dentist", do you : Look it up in a dictionary? Remember your last visit 30 years ago? Or open a bottle of beer with your last-remaining teeth?'

It also described you as a typical Englander if you answered yes to dreaming of Pizza, Pippa or Camilla, according to the Daily Star.

The quiz was printed in Bild as part of an ongoing battle between English and German newspapers

The tongue-in-cheek survey was carried out to prove to readers of Bild just how un-English they are.

Another question was: 'Which part of a celebrity would you most like to be: Wayne Rooney's hairstyle? Amy Winehouse's liver? Or Ryan Giggs' d**k?'

Making reference to the English 
obsession with alcohol the quiz asks: 'How do you like your beer? 
Lukewarm; Without a head; By the gallon'

The
newspaper also alludes to a lack of willingness to use sun cream with 
several questions referring to things the English can make do without on
holiday and 'Talking about holidays, what do you think of sun block? 
It's for Krauts only; Doesn't taste good in gin; My skin is my sun 
block.'

The quiz was a 
reaction to British Press coverage over findings at University College, 
London, which found that 50 per cent of us have German blood running 
through our veins.

There
were several reports that the Germans found a little less than 
complimentary, referring to World War Two, wearing socks with sandals 
and the 1966 World Cup.

Amy Winehouse's liver came up on the quiz alongside Wayne Rooney's hair style
