Poisoned former KGB spy  Alexander Litvinenko was effectively a triple agent working for MI6 and the Spanish secret service, it was claimed yesterday.

He was on the payroll of MI6 and had a handler called ‘Martin’, a barrister for his widow Marina said.

The Spanish secret service was also bankrolling his espionage activities and both stipends were paid into a joint bank account he held with his wife, it was said.

'Murdered': Litvinenko was hospitalised after the radioactive substance, Polonium-210, was allegedly put in his tea. He died three days after this picture was taken on November 20, 2006

A pre-inquest hearing yesterday was 
told that the Government has ‘established’ Moscow has a case to answer 
that Mr Litvinenko was assassinated in London.

Mr Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair.

As he lay dying in hospital, 
‘reluctant to tell police that he was an MI6 agent’, he handed 
detectives the mobile phone number of his MI6 handler ‘Martin’, the 
hearing conducted by High Court judge Sir Robert Owen was told.

The death of 43-year-old Mr 
Litvinenko,  a fugitive from the Putin regime, in November 2006 plunged 
Anglo-Russian diplomatic relations into deep freeze.

Determined: Marina Litvinenko, the widow of former spy Alexander, arrives at Camden Town Hall in London today

Former KGB agents Andrei Lugovoy and 
Dmitry Kovtun, who met him at the Millennium Hotel, are prime suspects 
in the murder. Both deny involvement.

The Crown Prosecution Service wants to charge Lugovoy, but Russia refuses to extradite him.

Mr Litvinenko’s widow believes MI6 
failed to protect her husband. Her QC, Ben Emmerson, told the hearing at
 Camden Town Hall in North London: ‘Mr Litvinenko had been for a number 
of years a regular and paid agent and employee of MI6 with a dedicated 
handler whose pseudonym was Martin.’

He said that, at the behest of MI6, Mr
 Litvinenko was also working for the Spanish security services, where 
his handler was called ‘Uri’.

Mr Emmerson said the inquest should 
consider whether MI6 failed in its duty to protect Mr Litvinenko against
 a ‘real and immediate risk to life’.

He suggested there was ‘an enhanced 
duty resting on the British Government to ensure his safety when tasking
 him with dangerous operations involving engagement with foreign 
agents’.

He said Mr Litvinenko was supplying the Spanish with information on organised crime and Russian mafia activity in Spain.

Mr Emmerson said: ‘It is Marina 
Litvinenko’s belief that the evidence will show that her husband’s death
 was a murder and that Andrei Lugovoy was the main perpetrator.’ The QC 
claimed Mr Litvinenko and Lugovoy were working together and had planned 
to travel to Spain to deliver information about links between the 
Russian mafia, the Kremlin and the country’s President Vladimir Putin.

‘He had a separate telephone for 
contacting Martin and by the time of his death he also had a separate 
direct phone for contacting Lugovoy,’ he said.

When Mr Litvinenko fell ill – but 
before he realised he was slowly dying from polonium – he phoned Lugovoy
 from his bed in University College Hospital to say that he could not 
make the trip.

In a further twist, it was claimed by a
 lawyer acting for Russian dissident billionaire Boris Berezovsky that 
Lugovoy was actually double-crossing his spymasters at the Kremlin. Mr 
Litvinenko died three weeks after being poisoned by the radioactive 
isotope.

An inquiry set up after his death said
 secret Government documents, which included material submitted by 
Scotland Yard and intelligence agencies, showed that the Russian state 
did have a case to answer.

The extraordinary claims are expected to plunge relations between Britain and Russia to a new low.

Hugh Davies, counsel to the inquest, 
said: ‘Our assessment is that the Government material does establish a 
prima facie case as to the culpability of the Russian state in the death
 of Alexander Litvinenko.’

Mr Litvinenko, 43, was allegedly poisoned while drinking tea during a meeting with former KGB contacts at the Millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square, pictured, in November 2006

He added the evidence ruled out the 
involvement of Chechen terrorist groups, the Spanish mafia, Russian 
exile Mr Berezovsky and the British Government in his death.

Mr Davies said assessments of material submitted by the Government had shown no evidence it had failed to protect him.

Until now, the Russians have remained 
at arm’s length but yesterday the Kremlin indicated it would like to 
become an ‘interested party’ when the full inquest begins next year, 
giving its own QC the chance to make submissions and cross-examine 
witnesses.

Mr Emmerson said the evidence amounted
 to a ‘state-sponsored assassination’ by Moscow. At yesterday’s hearing,
 he also cited evidence from a Wikileaks cable which quoted Mr 
Litvinenko saying Putin was implicated in the nation’s mafia and that 
Russia was a ‘mafia state’.

Neil Garnham QC, representing the Home
 Office, told the hearing he could ‘neither confirm nor deny’ whether Mr
 Litvinenko was employed by British intelligence services.

After the hearing, Mrs Litvinenko said
 she was ‘hopeful’ the full inquest would answer her questions, 
especially about Moscow’s alleged involvement. The full inquest, 
beginning on May 1, will be held before Sir Robert Owen who has been 
appointed assistant deputy coroner.

Alexander Litvinenko fled to Britain after accusing senior officials in Moscow of ordering a number of assassinations.

The former KGB officer was granted asylum with his wife and son in 2000 and allegedly started working with both MI5 and MI6, revealing secrets on the Putin regime.

Mr Litvinenko, 43, is also believed to have worked with other European intelligence agencies and he wrote a series of books in which he accused the FSB – the successor to the KGB – of carrying out terror attacks and murders to help get Vladimir Putin into power.

Keen for information on the Russian mafia, he met two former FSB men, Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovturn, at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair, on November 1, 2006.

Hours later, he collapsed at home and began vomiting. He was admitted to hospital three days later.Litvinenko, who lost his hair because of the radiation, released a statement blaming ‘barbaric’ Putin for involvement in his poisoning. He died on November 22.

Police went to Moscow to interview Lugovoy and Kovturn, but Russia refused to extradite Lugovoy, triggering a diplomatic row in which both countries expelled diplomats.
