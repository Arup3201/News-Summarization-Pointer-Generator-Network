Former Gunner Ray Parlour has claimed that Arsenal are already out of the Premier League title race and are now just competing for a Champions League spot.

Arsene Wenger's side endured another frustrating afternoon at the Emirates Stadium, drawing 2-2 with Hull in a repeat of last year's FA Cup final.

The Gunners dominated for most of the game but as time wore on they appeared to be heading for a loss. A late Danny Welbeck goal eventually salvaged a point for the hosts but supporters will be concerned their club have won just two of their opening eight league matches.

The result leaves Arsenal 11 points adrift of Premier League leaders Chelsea, and Parlour believes his old team don't have the quality to compete with either Jose Mourinho's side or Manchester City.

'I think Arsenal are fighting for third or fourth place,' Parlour told talkSPORT. 'You look at Manchester City and Chelsea and they're in a different league compared to Arsenal. 

'They're so far above Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Spurs. I think all these teams are fighting for two places, they're fighting for third and fourth.

'Chelsea grind out results. They're so clinical in the way they get results and Manchester City stand a great chance, particularly if (Sergio) Aguero can keep playing like that. He was fantastic (against Tottenham), absolutely different class.

'Those two teams are far apart from Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Spurs, so that's what Arsenal are left fighting for.'
