A man who became a viral sensation known as ‘Kai the Hatchet-Wielding Hitchhiker’ has been indicted on first-degree murder charges in connection with the beating death of an elderly New Jersey lawyer.

Union County prosecutors say 25-year-old Caleb McGillvary could face a life sentence if he is convicted. The indictment was handed up Wednesday by a county grand jury.

McGillvary is accused of killing 74-year-old Joseph Galfy, whose body was found May 13 in his Clark home. Authorities say McGillvary and Galfy met in New York City and McGillvary stayed at Galfy’s home.

McGillvary, 25, was indicted on first-degree murder charge

McGillvary was arrested in Philadelphia several days after Galfy’s body was found. He is represented by the public defender's office, which doesn't comment on cases.

The Canadian gained online
fame in February after intervening in an attack on a California utility
worker in which he described using a hatchet to fend off a further 
attack.

Last month, McGillvary and one of his supporters launched a YouTube channel featuring recordings of the 25-year-old talking on the phone about his life behind bars and performing songs.

In the most recent installment posted last week, McGillvary sang a ditty about surfing, talked about the books he has been reading in jail and recounted a story from his hitchhiking days, in which he spent time with an unhinged, disabled Vietnam War veteran and his dog.

McGillvary also explained that he has been unable to communicate with his friends and supporters in a while because he has been denied access to writing materials - 'in violation of the 14th Amendment' - after he was accused of tempering with a rubber pen.  

The man concluded his monologue by expressing hope that soon he would be given access to a radio, because 'life without music is kinda boring.' 

One of McGillvary's friends, a woman named Donna, posted on a Facebook page that has been set up to drum up support for him that it could take up to two years before 'Kai' goes on trial.

'I can only hope that every supporter stands by his side,' she wrote Wednesday. 

Also on Wednesday, a friend named Echele posted on the page
that she and some of McGillvary's other fans visited 
him in jail the day before.

'He looks very well and is in as good
of spirits as are possible,' the friend wrote, adding that the 
25-year-old has been whiling away the hours meditating and reading letters from his supporters.

In August, the 25-year-old suspect was rushed to a hospital after suffering a self-inflicted wound in an apparent suicide attempt.

Kai became an Internet celebrity after
he thwarted a deadly attack on a California woman with the help of his 
hatchet last February.

Staunch supporters: Following his arrest in May on a murder charge, McGillvary's many fans have been raising money for his defense fund

Promotional materials: Kai's friends have been distributing 'Free Kai' posters containing information on the donation page and the Facebook support groups

A video of McGillvary's interview after the incident has gone viral, spawning parodies and countless memes on social media sites, and earning his thousands of admirers.

Following his arrest in May on a murder charge, McGillvary's numerous fans from across the country have been hard at work trying to raise money for his defense fund.

Terry Ratliff, of Georgia, who has emerged as one of Kai's staunchest supporters, set up an online fundraiser on the site GoFundMe.com, asking people to donate $70,000 to help the 25-year-old homeless man cover his legal fees. 

As of Thursday morning, Kai's online war chest boasted just under $4,500 in donations.

Kai's friends also have been spreading the word about his predicament by distributing 'Free Kai' posters depicting the 25-year-old 'homefree' hitchhiker playing the guitar and advertising the donation page and the Facebook support group.

Despite appearances on Jimmy Kimmel and an immediate fan base, Kai's hero status suffered a blow after he was accused in July of beating 73-year-old lawyer Joseph Galfy to death at his home after they met in Times Square.

Galfy's body was found two days later. Their earlier encounter was caught on surveillance video.

The victim was found severely beaten and wearing only his underwear and socks by police, who went to his home to check on his well-being.

Statements posted on McGillvary's Facebook page following the homicide indicated the encounter was sexual in nature.

On his Facebook page, McGillvary's last post before he was arrested said: 'What would you do? if you awoke in a stranger's house and found you'd been drugged and sexually assaulted.'

One friend who commented suggests 'hitting him with a hatchet' – and McGillvary's final comment on the post said: 'I like your idea.'

Photos and a YouTube video from early March show the 24-year-old vagrant getting an elaborate tattoo on his right cheek which helped police apprehend him after a Starbucks barrista recognized it and told police.

McGillivary was later booked into the Union County Jail on $3million bail.

McGillvary, better known on YouTube and Facebook as Kai
Lawrence, Caleb Kai Lawrence and Kai Nicodemus, became an instant Internet celebrity
in February when he was featured on a California news report for saving three people
from 54-year-old Jett Simmons McBride by hitting him on the head with a
hatchet.

The homeless hitchhiker, who describes himself as 'homefree,'
was riding in a passenger seat with McBride when he said the man started making
racist comments and calling himself Jesus Christ.

The incident culminated with the out-of-control driver slamming
into a black utility worker and pinning him against his truck.

He then
allegedly attacked two women who came to the aid of the victim, at which point
McGillvary jumped into action and hit the assailant over the head with a
hatchet he had on him. 

McGillvary, sporting long shaggy hair tied with a bandanna,
later described his heroics in a hilarious, profanity-laced stream-of-consciousness
interview that instantly went viral online.

Since the February incident, the 24-year-old self-described
surfer dude has been regularly writing about his adventures on the road on his
Facebook page under the user name 'Caleb Kai Lawrence Yodhehwawheh.

According to his Facebook page, Galfy was a founding partner
at the Rahway law firm Kochanski, Baron Galfy, P.C.    

Galfy's neighbors said the 73-year-old had been living alone
since his long-time partner died five years prior.

According to 
Galfy's obituary, he served in the Army from 1965 to 1970 as a major, 
and got his Juris Doctor degree from Seton Hall University.

Galfy served as the attorney for the Planning Board in Green Brook, and in his free time played in a wedding band for 25 years.
