A second ambulance trust suspected of secretly downgrading emergency calls last night admitted it had reclassified 11,000 patients.

Yorkshire Ambulance Service said some 10,918 calls were re-categorised as less serious last year – 30 a day.

It follows a report that revealed how the East of England Ambulance Trust changed the status of 8,324 calls in a two-month period last year to meet response times.

It was accused of hastening the deaths of 57 terminally ill patients by downgrading 999 calls so ambulances either arrived too late or not at all.

In Yorkshire, whistleblowers claim urgent cases are being re-categorised once it becomes clear paramedics will not arrive within the eight-minute target set for the most serious cases – leaving some patients waiting up to 50 minutes.

One whistleblower told the Wakefield Express: ‘Some absolutely major calls are being graded as green [less serious] because they know they are not going to get to it.’ Another paramedic said: ‘They are playing with lives on a daily basis.’ 

The ambulance service – which serves a population of five million – is under pressure to meet targets as it attempts to become a cherished ‘foundation trust’ with less State control. Figures reveal how 348 of 722 life-threatening ‘Red 1’ calls were reclassified as less serious ‘Red 2’.

That meant patients still had an eight-minute response target but a delay is factored into the timing.

Another 374 calls were downgraded to ‘green’, meaning a response time of between 20 or 50 minutes – or simply advice over the phone. 

Union Unite – which uncovered the figures – said more than 500 staff and members of the public have now complained to the Care Quality Commission watchdog.

Len McCluskey, General Secretary of the union, said: ‘There needs to be a thorough investigation into allegations that the service could be gambling with people’s lives. 

Senior management at the Yorkshire Ambulance Services have a record of systemic failure, incompetence and are mired in allegations of cover-ups.’

Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who sits on the Commons health select committee, said: ‘Politicians of all parties need to grow up and realise targets are damaging.’ Paramedics claim control room staff are instructed to ring patients back if it becomes clear the ambulance is not going to reach them on time.

Staff then carry out a phone assessment where it is ‘agreed’ that callers are not critically ill so an ambulance is not needed as quickly. 

A grandfather spent nearly three days in a cramped hospital stock room because no space was available on a ward.

Michael Steel, 63, right,  was squeezed into a storage area filled with medical supplies and lit by a glaring fluorescent strip light.

He struggled to sleep because of constant interruptions as staff came in to grab equipment or move his bed to reach a drugs cupboard.

Mr Steel, who was being treated for an inflamed liver, also claimed other patients were left to go hungry by overstretched nurses.

He helped feed and comfort some, including one severely ill man who died as he held his hand.

‘It beggars belief that something like this can happen in this day and age – people don’t believe it when I tell them,’ he said.

The retired salesman was admitted to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, twice last month.

The second time he was moved to the 12ft by 10ft stock room and given intravenous antibiotics.

The hospital trust has apologised to Mr Steel, saying it was struggling with an ‘unprecedented number of emergency patients’. It rejected the hungry patient claims.

However, the Yorkshire trust insists that patients are only called back when it might be ‘beneficial’ and they are then offered the most ‘appropriate care’.

At the East of England Ambulance trust, managers agreed beforehand that certain calls involving terminally ill patients would not be deemed as serious – forcing them to wait up to 50 minutes or simply receiving advice over the phone. 

Yesterday David Cameron described the actions of the ambulance service in East Anglia as ‘clearly wrong’.

He told MPs: ‘The change was made without the knowledge of the trust’s board. 

As soon as it was found out, the chief executive reversed the decision and ordered an independent investigation. The investigation found there had been no harm to patients. I think it is important to put this in context.’

However, campaigners dispute the finding of the investigation and say terminally ill patients may have had precious extra time with loved ones had ambulances been dispatched.
