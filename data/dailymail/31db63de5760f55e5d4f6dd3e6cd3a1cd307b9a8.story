A house once lived in by artist Vincent Van Gogh is to go under the hammer for £475,000 - and comes complete with its very own outside toilet.

Described by estate agents as a property in need of 'modernisation', the three-storey property has no central heating but has an English Heritage blue plaque on the outside wall honouring the artist.

The painter lived at the home in 1873 after coming to London to work at an art dealers at the age of 20.

Van Gogh is said to have spend one of the ‘happiest years of his life’ lodging at the three-bedroom home in Hackford Road, Brixton.

The Dutch artist, who resided on the top floor of the three-storey house, even sketched the property, which was built in about 1850.

Seven of Van Gogh's paintings are in the ‘most expensive ever sold list’, which were purchased for a combined total of £425million.

Sellers Savills have put the house up for sale for the first time in 65 years - and boast that it offers an outside loo and real fireplaces, among other ‘period features’.

Russell Taylor, of Savills, said the auction is due to take place on March 27 after the owners decided to sell up after 65 years.

He added: 'It has probably only changed hands twice since Vincent lived there.

'It needs total modernisation but a lot of features such as the fireplaces where he would have warmed himself on a cold night were covered up so they are not damaged in any way.'

Letters sent to his brother Theo say he had fallen in love with the landlady’s daughter Eugenie Loyer, who did not return his love - the spark which some say started his descent into mental illness.

In one letter Van Gogh said that Eugenie was ‘quite beautiful and so quiet that you almost forget you are in London’.

Savills state: 'At the next Savills Auction, to be held on 27 March, 2012, the Savills team will be auctioning 87 Hackford Road, SW9, the former home of Vincent van Gogh from 1873 -1874.

'At the age of 20 Van Gogh arrived in London to start work at an art dealership in Southampton Street and from August of 1873 he lived at 87 Hackford Road.

'The house was owned by Mrs Loyer who lived there with her daughter, it was Mrs Loyer’s daughter who Van Gogh reputedly first fell in love with.

'There is also a sketch of Hackford Road which includes number 87, this was in the possession of Eugenie Loyer’s grand daughter, Mrs Kathleen Maynard, and is now in the Van Gogh museum, Amsterdam.

'The Hackford Road sketch is the earliest surviving drawing from Vincent’s English period.

'87 Hackford Road, SW9 is an end of terrace three bed period property with rear garden and is in need of full modernisation and is on at a guide of £475,000.'
