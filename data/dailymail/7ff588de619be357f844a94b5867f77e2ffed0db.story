Two members of Congress got into a shouting match Thursday over whether the error-plagued Obamacare Americans give up their privacy rights when they apply for health insurance through the federal government.

Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey unleashed a round of verbal Kung-Fu during a House hearing after Reps. Joe Barton of Texas and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee accused software contractors of violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPPA, by collecting Americans' personal information from Healthcare.gov.

And one company official testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee that 2,000 employees have access to the information Americans give the Obamacare website when they apply for insurance.

'I will not yield to this monkey court or whatever this thing is!' yelled New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone during an exchange about data privacy on the Obamacare website

Texas Rep. Joe Barton insisted that the data-gathering at Healthcare.gov doesn't comply with health privacy laws

But 'HIPPA only applies when there's health information being provided,' Pallone insisted. 'That's not in play here today. No health information is required in the application process. And why is that? Because pre-existing conditions don't matter.'

'So once again here we have my Republican colleagues trying to scare everybody.'

'Will the gentleman yield?' Rep. Barton interrupted.

'No, I will not yield to this monkey court or whatever this thing is!' Pallone yelled.

'This is not a monkey court,' Barton countered.

'Do whatever you want!' Pallone added. 'I am not yielding.'

Pallone acknowledged that Obamacare applicants are 'asked about your address, your date of birth,' but insisted that no one is asked to share 'health information.'

And according to the Department of Health and Human Services, sharing even those kinds of data can violate HIPPA if it's within the context of a medical insurance transaction.

Witnesses in Thursday's hearing included (L-R) Senior VP of CGI Federal Cheryl Campbell, group executive vice president for Optum/QSSI Andrew Slavitt, corporate counsel for Equifax Workforce Solutions Lynn Spellecy, and program director for Serco John Lau

Rep. Marsha Blackburn dug into privacy issues, forcing one corporate official to concede that 2,000 of his employees have access to private consumer data

HIPPA, passed in 1996, forbids doctors, hospitals, health care clearinghouses and health insurers – and their 'business associates' – from disclosing 'individually identifiable health information' related to anyone's medical records.

California Rep. Anna Eshoo mocked the companies behind the crash-prone Obamacare website for blaming an unexpected traffic volume for their problems: 'Amazon and eBay don't crash the week before Christmas. And ProFlowers doesn't crash on Valentine's Day'

Information covered under the law, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 'includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).'

John Lau, a program director at Serco – a company that helps the federal government determine if Obamacare applicants meet eligibility requirements – testified that '2,000 people' in his company have access to their applications, and that the information was retained for 30 days.

'You know,' countered Rep. Blackburn, 'under HIPPA regs, no one's supposed to have access to that database.'

Equifax Workforce Solutions attorney Lynn Spellecy, whose company has been contracted to verify the income levels of Obamacare applicants who claim subsidies to pay for their insurance, described the kind of information that is changing hands.

'We are provided only with limited information: Social Security numbers, names and date of birth, which we use to match against our system,' she said.

Barton first raised the privacy issue with a visual aid showing part of the Healthcare.gov 'source code,' the computer language that generates the Web page consumers see.

'You have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system,' the text reads.

'At any time, and for any lawful Government purpose, the government may monitor, intercept, and search and seize any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system.  Any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system may be disclosed or used for any lawful Government purpose.'

Serco program director John Lau (R) testified that 2,000 of his company's employees have access to consumers' information collected by the Obamacare website

Democrats on the panel claimed that since the text was buried in a part of the website's code that consumers can't see, it was meaningless.

But Cheryl Campbell, senior vice president of CGI Federal, the main contractor for Healthcare.gov, testified that 'yes,' she was aware it was part of the website, and that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, made the decision to keep it hidden.

Senior vice president of CGI Federal Cheryl Campbell came under fire as the chief developer behind Healthcare.gov

'You were aware,' Barton continued. 'Okay, do you think that's HIPPA compliant? How can that be? You know it's not HIPPA compliant! Admit it – you're under oath!'

'That is CMS's decision to make,' Campbell shot back, 'what is public or not.'

Campbell also accused CMS of botching the Obamacare website's pre-launch testing, saying that the government agency was solely responsible for testing Healthcare.gov once all the various contractors delivered their individual pieces of the project

'CMS did the end-to-end testing,' she said, while acknowledging that the final result has produced unacceptable results.

Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo wasn't impressed.

'This is the 21st Century. It's 2013.' Eshoo lectured Campbell. 'There are thousands of websites that handle concurrent volumes far larger than what Healthcare.gov was faced with.'

Eshoo represents California's Silicon Valley region.

'You keep speaking about unexpected volumes, Ms. Campbell, and that really sticks in my craw. ... I think that's really kind of a lame excuse. Amazon and eBay don't crash the week before Christmas. And ProFlowers doesn't crash on Valentine's Day.'
