She's back: Sally Bercow has reactivated her twitter feed after closing it down following a string of high profile blunders

Sally Bercow has reactivated her Twitter account after she closed it following a string of high profile blunders which left her in legal hot water.

Despite admitting that she had her 'a**-whipped' by her lawyer and husband over her Twitter activity when deleting her account a little over  week ago, the Speaker's wife said that she was 'humbly' reactivating her feed as she has learnt lessons and 'will not screw up again'.

Last night she Tweeted: 'Humbly reactivating account on #Levesoneve *grabs tinsel & mince pies* coz learnt lesson, miss Twitter & will not screw up again. Hello!'

She later said: 'Better add *fingers crossed* to last tweet actually....'

Mrs Bercow closed her account on November 20 after her most recent high profile error - naming a British runaway schoolgirl protected by a court order.

The breach prompted calls for her to 'turn off Twitter' to avoid any more legal problems.

Her exit from Twitter also came just a fortnight after she used the site to name former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine following a BBC2 Newsnight report which alleged a senior Conservative figure from the Thatcher era was a child abuser.

He was not named on the programme but was identified quickly online. It later emerged that he was the victim of mistaken identity.

Lord McAlpine, who settled with the BBC for £185,000, is now said to be suing Mrs Bercow, although she insists that what she said on Twitter was ‘mischievous’ rather than ‘libellous’.

Legal experts had urged her to turn off the account after she referred to the case of Jeremy Forrest, a 30-year-old teacher in Eastbourne, East Sussex, who was arrested in Bordeaux in September after allegedly running away with a schoolgirl.

He had been charged with abducting a child and remanded in custody at a court hearing a week before the Tweet when the court made a Section 39 Order under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, banning the naming of the teenager.

Reactivated: Sally Bercow Tweeted last night that she has learnt lessons from her recent Twitter gaffes

On best behaviour: Mrs Bercow later added that she has her fingers crossed that her Tweets won't land her in any more hot water

Gone: After several mistakes and calls for her to 'turn off Twitter' Sally Bercow's personal account had been deleted

Final tweet: In a message to her thousands of followers Mrs Bercow revealed she had a telling off after naming the girl and that she hoped to be back

Legal experts said at the time that using a social networking site such as Twitter to comment does constitute publication, meaning Mrs Bercow, a Labour activist, could face a fine.

Sarah Webb, a media lawyer with the firm Payne Hicks Beach, said: ‘The contempt of court requirements will apply to her just the same as any newspaper or broadcaster. I would advise her to be very cautious.

‘I would certainly urge her to turn off her Twitter account at the moment.

Reference: The Labour activist was referring to the case of Jeremy Forrest, a teacher in Eastbourne, who was arrested in Bordeaux in September. He is pictured in October getting on a plane to return to Britain 

Legal action: Earlier this month she used Twitter to name former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine, following a Newsnight report which alleged a senior Tory figure was a child abuser

'She may not know the law, but equally most people who have an understanding of these things know that in respect of actions involving children and things like that, you can’t go around naming them. I think it is surprising that none of these things seem to cross her radar.'

Some Twiter users were delighted to see Mrs Bercow back on the social networking site.

Bruce Martin Tweeted: 'Welcome back from the naughty step. We missed you.' 

Angry: Sally Bercow was sent a letter from solicitors acting for Lord McAlpine (pictured in April 1998)

Couple: Mrs Bercow's (right) husband John (left), the Commons speaker, is meant to be an impartial character
