Most newborn babies look a bit like Winston Churchill.

But one couple have spoken of their shock after noticing the scan of their unborn baby looked like - Margaret Thatcher.

Mark Smith, 39, and wife Dawn, 36, - who are 'totally anti-Tory' - returned home from their 27-week scan and immediately posted the image on Facebook.

Tory tot: A couple from Kent claim they can see an image of Margaret Thatcher in an ultrasound scan of their unborn child

...Now you come to mention it: The Iron Lady with trademark bouffant and pearls

Just hours later a friend pointed out the outline of the Iron Lady floating over the top of the baby’s body.

The couple, from Stanhope, Kent, said the image looks 'just like Maggie’s character from spitting image'.

Bizarrely, they also claim they can make out the faces of Maggie’s former rivals, Labour leader Neil Kinnock and ex-Lib Dem leader David Steel.

The images all appear in a line in the shadows cast by the ultrasound above the baby, with the outline of Baroness Thatcher in the middle.

Father of six Mr Smith said: 'It is such a strange thing too see. We had not noticed it at first we were too busy looking at the baby.

'But we put it on Facebook over the weekend and someone just spotted that it looked a bit like Maggie Thatcher.

'Its amazing how much it looks like her. It’s really uncanny but it was a bit of shock - we are not Tory at all. It looks like a scene from Spitting Image.'

Despite the likeness, the couple have no intention of naming their child Margaret or Maggie after the former prime minister.

House husband Mr Smith added: 'We are definitely not naming our child after any of them. We think it might be a girl, but we’re totally anti-Tory so she won’t be a Maggie.'

Instead the Smiths intend to call their child Daisy if it is a girl, or Harry if it is a boy.

Margaret Thatcher became Britain’s first female prime minister when she was elected in 1979 and ran the country for 11 years before stepping down in 1990.

She received he title of Baroness in 1992 when she was raised to a peerage and turns 87 this year.
