A baby deer is alive today thanks to the quick thinking of a landscaper and his handy box-cutter.

Bill Schulte was driving home from church through Prior Lake, Minnesota on Sunday when he saw a doe get hit by a car.

He pulled over to the side of the road to check on the deer and saw that it was too late.

However, he noticed a movement in the deer's abdomen and realized the female was pregnant.

A newborn fawn that has been nicknamed Bambi was born in an emergency c-section by a landscaper who witnessed its mother's death while driving

Quick thinking: Bill Schulte noticed the deer was pregnant and decided to try to save the unborn fawn by using his landscaping box cutter to free the baby

'I was like, oh, she's gone, but the baby's in there kicking. I've got to do something,' Mr Schulte told WCCO.

So he took out his retractable box cutter he uses in his job as a landscaper and worked quickly to free the unborn fawn.

'It was just nice to see how he came right out nice and smooth,' Mr Schulte said, 'and I just worked the neck, because his neck came out first.'

Newborn: Mr Schulte was surprised by how easy the baby deer came out

Life begins: Above, the first picture of the newborn fawn just minutes after birth

Rescued: Mr Schulte took pictures of the newborn fawn just after the emergency c-section on Sunday

Mr Schulte then drove 30 minutes to deliver the baby fawn to a wildlife rehabilitator

After the fawn's lucky birth, Mr Schulte drove 30 minutes to a wildlife rehabilitation center in Roseville where he entrusted the newborn in the care of Polly Rixe, a licensed wildlife rehabilitator.

In just a few days the fawn has already growing fast and is already walking.

'My daughter calls it Bambi,' Ms Rixe told KSTP. 'We don't normally name our deer but right away she said this is Bambi.'

Named: The rescued fawn has been nicknamed Bambi by Polly Rixe and her family

Growing fast: Bambi has started walking and is being kept in a playpen with two other rescued fawns

Ms Rixe says it will take most of the summer to get Bambi ready for the wild, but the fawn is already working towards that goal with its first visit outside earlier this week.

'It’s kind of crazy,' Rixe said. 'I wouldn’t necessarily promote people doing that, but I guess for this particular fawn, it’s a happy ending.'

As for Mr Schulte, he thinks he was meant to save Bambi. Twenty years ago, he was involved in a car accident that sent him into a coma for two weeks.

'The good lord didn't need me up there yet and wanted me to accomplish things down here and this must have been one of them,' he said. 

First steps: Bambi started walking outside this week. The fawn's training to re-enter the wild will take all summer
