Parking on double yellow lines in central London usually guarantees a fine of at least £65, but when these three motorists pulled up for a quick coffee last night they knew they would be in the clear.

They were in fact armed officers from the Diplomatic Protection Group, who stopped right on top of the two lines, a mere 75 yards from the Charing Cross police station.

Passers-by in the bustling central London tourist district were stunned when the marked police car stopped and three officers jumped out of their car at, 9.30pm.

The BMW of the three armed officers is parked on double yellow lines in William IV Street outside the Chandos pub, central London. The officers are in a sandwich shop ordering their evening coffee

The three armed officers are chatting in the sandwich shop last night at 9.30. Their car is outside, parked on double yellow lines - yards from the Charring Cross police station

Even more so when it turned out they were only popping into Pret-A-Manger on William IV Street outside the Chandos pub.

One angry witness, who was enjoying a drink on the pavement with friends said: ‘Can you believe it! That sort of thing really annoys me.

Tourists and people working in the area were enjoying an evening drink at 9.30 last night when the marked car pulled up and parked on the yellow lines. Some were amused but other witnesses were were angry

'If I were to do that I’d have my car towed or at least get a fine within minutes.

Mine's with cream: One of the police officers returning to the marked police car. Passers-by in William IV Street looked on with envy as officers parked on the yellow lines

'They did it knowing they wouldn't get fined.'

Westminster Council does not fine marked police cars.

But a Metropolitan Police spokesman said officers still had to abide by the law.

Senior officers within the force have since been made aware of the incident.

The spokesman added: 'Officers should always ensure police vehicles are parked in a considerate and appropriate manner.

'MPS officers should respect parking restrictions - including yellow lines - unless there are good operational reasons for not doing so.

'Instructions concerning shoulder numbers displayed during operational duty are clear and unambiguous - they should always be shown.

'Senior officers have been made aware of the pictures and will take appropriate action.'

Another passer-by, a young woman who works in the area, laughed off the incident.

‘It happens all the time around here,’ she said. ‘I’m not annoyed when it happens, but it’s still a bit frustrating to see it when i can't do the same.'
