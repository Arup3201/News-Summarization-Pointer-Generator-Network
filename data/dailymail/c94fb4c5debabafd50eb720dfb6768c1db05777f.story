A Brooklyn jury has awarded more than $500,000 to a man who sued the city for a broken ankle he suffered during an arrest for shoplifting.

The jury awarded Kevin Jarman $510,000 on Wednesday for the injury.

Jarman, 50, had filed the suit after pleading guilty to shoplifting at a Queens Pathmark supermarket in 2011.

Jarman has also received other payouts from the city, according to The New York Post.

In 2005, he sued the NYPD for false arrest after a drug sale charge was dropped. The city settled for $15,000.

Last month, the city settled for $20,000 after Jarman sued police for false arrest in another drug case.

The city's Law Department says it intends to challenge Wednesday's verdict.

On the day of Jarman's arrest for shoplifting, he fell over and broke his ankle after Police Sergeant Samuel Morales yanked on his handcuffs.

Jarman, who is six foot two, complained that the cuffs were too tight, but instead of loosening them, Morales pulled them, causing the fall.

Jarman was admitted to Jamaica Hospital, where he spend nine days recovering.

Despite the jury awarding Jarman the large payout just hours after closing arguments, law enforcements will battle the verdict.

'There's no rhyme or reason for the figure they came up with. These guys are getting huge paydays, and for what? A broken ankle? Half a million? To a shoplifter? It's getting out of control', an officer told the Post.
