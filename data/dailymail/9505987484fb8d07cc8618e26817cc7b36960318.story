Are Tottenham right to part with boss Villas-Boas?

Andre Villas-Boas has been sacked as Tottenham Hotspur manager following the 5-0 defeat against Liverpool at White Hart Lane.

The Portuguese boss has been under pressure for several weeks since a 6-0 defeat to Manchester City, but looked to have bought himself some time with wins at Fulham and Sunderland.

His coaching team of Jose Mario Rocha, Luis Martins and Daniel Sousa have also left the club.

But the home defeat on Sunday was the final straw, as Villas-Boas found himself axed for the second time in just under two years.

The club's technical co-ordinator Tim Sherwood will take temporary charge of the squad for Wednesday's Capital One Cup home clash with West Ham.

A statement said: 'The Club can 
announce that agreement has been reached with Head Coach, Andre 
Villas-Boas, for the termination of his services.

'The decision was by mutual consent and in the interests of all parties.

'We wish Andre well for the future.'

Villas-Boas plummeted in the betting 
markets for next Premier League manager to be shown the door after the 
defeat, which came just three weeks after the 6-0 thrashing at City.

Nacer Chadli (Twente) - £6m

Roberto Soldado (Valencia) - £26m

Christian Eriksen (Ajax) - £11.5m

Paulinho (Corinthians) - £17m

Total: £107.6million

Levy is already lining up a successor to Villas-Boas - possibly in the form of a temporary manager.

The Spurs chairman is understood to be sounding out potential replacements and Sportsmail has learnt that the Tottenham chairman favours an experienced coach with World Cup pedigree.

Fabio Capello, who was at White Hart Lane on Sunday performing TV duties, out-of-work Gus Hiddink and Glenn Hoddle and three high-profile names in the frame, although Spurs may not be able to convince the former to come back into the thrust of club management.

Match of the Day 2 last night carried footage of Andre Villas-Boas’s post-match press conference where he was quizzed by Sportsmail’s Neil Ashton. Here’s the transcript of their exchange.

Neil Ashton: Is this your team? Are these the players that you want to work with and the players you would chose to work with?

AVB:
 I’m not sure if I can make it public. We have worked hard to build a 
strong team and we have a strong team and we are happy with the 
signings.

Ajax boss Frank de Boer and Basle's Murat Yakin are also being tipped as possible replacements.

Michael Laudrup's agent told Sportsmail the Dane is happy at Swansea and will be at the Liberty Stadium until the end of the season.

Bayram Tutumlu said: 'Michael Laudrup is very happy at Swansea. It is a good club and he wants to stay at Swansea.'

Villas-Boas was relieved of his duties as Chelsea boss in February 2012 after defeat in Napoli in the last 16 of the Champions League.

He then took over from Harry Redknapp that summer after the Spurs boss had been sacked.

Villas-Boas had on Sunday insisted it was down to him to work harder in the job, but his time has been cut short.

Asked how much time he would be given at Spurs, Villas-Boas said: 'That's the only thing I can't control, it's not my call so I can't say anything else.

'I have to get down to work, that's the only thing I can focus on.

'The call to make that decision is not mine, because obviously I won't resign and I'm not a quitter.

'The only thing I can do is work hard with the players to get them back on track.

'This is a top-four squad but in our Premier League form we are not there.'

While many frustrated Spurs fans will have welcomed the decision to sack Villas-Boas, Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand believes the north Londoners have been too hasty.

'Has sacking season started?' he asked on Twitter. 'Managers don't get any time these days. Spend £100m and watch someone else take over.

'AVB been unlucky: his most promising signing has been injured for the most part... (Christian) Eriksen'.
