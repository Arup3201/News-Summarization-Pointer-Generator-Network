Emmanuel Adebayor has admitted that Tottenham’s inability to win matches they dominate could cost them dear by the end of the season.

Spurs’ mental fragility as well as defensive lapses were all too evident at the Stadium of Light — even though they played some delightful football.

The lead provided by Nacer Chadli’s second-minute goal lasted 74 seconds before Adam Johnson was allowed through to level. Christian Eriksen restored the advantage only for team-mate Harry Kane to lose concentration as the ball bounced off him for an own-goal equaliser.

Adebayor is concerned that Spurs cannot see out games. He said: ‘If it happens a lot then yes, it is worrying. The most frustrating thing is that we weren’t rewarded for our performance. If you play badly and draw then it is quite good, as I am sure the Sunderland players will tell you. Their manager won’t be able to believe they came away with a point.’

Of Tottenham’s 15 shots, six were blocked, four saved, three were off target (two hitting the woodwork), and two went in. 

Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino said he needed to analyse what happened before commenting in detail on what went wrong. A lack of clinical finishing, some frantic Sunderland defending, a good display from host keeper Vito Mannone and some sloppy defending is what he’ll find.

‘(A draw) is difficult to take after dominating the game,’ Adebayor added. ‘But we will watch it again and see where we went wrong because when you have so much of a game and don’t win, it means something has gone wrong.’

Johnson conceded Spurs were the better team. ‘They were very good for sustained periods, and we had to battle out there,’ said the midfielder. 

‘They didn’t cut us open all the time but had periods of possession in front of our box. We defended quite well, considering the pressure they put us under. We showed character to stay in the game and get a point.’

Johnson’s manager, Gus Poyet, who played 98 times for Spurs between 2001 and 2004, was delighted with a point — and rightly so. He said it had been a ‘tough, tough day’.

‘I think they’ve got everything,’ he said of Tottenham. ‘On another day, they could have scored a couple of goals in a row and the game could have been over with 20 minutes left. But that’s the difference between winning and not getting three points.

‘It comes down to little things, like in the last minute Eriksen not being on the pitch to take a free kick. 

'In the end, Will (Buckley) could have scored and imagine if we had taken all three points — Spurs would have been devastated, but that’s football.’
