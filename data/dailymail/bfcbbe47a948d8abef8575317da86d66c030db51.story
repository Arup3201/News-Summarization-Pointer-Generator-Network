The heroism of Sam Burgess stepped up a notch on Tuesday after it was revealed the South Sydney star played on with a fractured eye socket as well as his broken cheekbone. 

The 25-year-old, who moves to the rugby union side later this month, will undergo surgery having suffered the injuries in the first minute against Canterbury Bulldogs and gone on to play the full game.

It is the latest development in a story that will see Burgess go down in rugby league folklore.

'Just laying in hospital waiting for surgery, I look similar to a hamster at the moment. I wouldn't change anything for the world though,' Burgess wrote on Twitter.

'Thanks to everyone for your well wishes and congratulations. It's been an amazing journey this year with a fitting end. Wow.'

His club said in a statement: 'Scans this morning have confirmed that Rabbitohs lock Sam Burgess requires surgery to repair fractures in his cheekbone and eye socket,' it said.

'Burgess will have surgery this afternoon to have a plate inserted into his face to repair the damage.'

Burgess was supposed to fly back to England on Wednesday ahead of switching codes with Bath. It is not yet known whether he will stay in Australia a little while longer. 

Bath expect Sam Burgess will need six weeks to recover from his broken cheekbone after an heroic, match-winning performance in Sunday's NRL Grand Final in Sydney which confirmed his place in rugby league folklore.

This was the scenario Bath would have feared — to see their high-profile new recruit suffer a setback just before joining them.

He was already facing a hasty education in the 15-man game in an attempt to force his way into England's World Cup squad for next year's tournament.

Now the learning process will have to start later than planned.

Last week, his new club released a video to herald his arrival and it ended with the date 25.10.14, which is when Toulouse visit The Rec in the European Champions Cup. However, it is understood that Burgess will just be introduced that day.

His five-year stint with the South Sydney Rabbitohs ended in glorious fashion, as he gallantly inspired the club's first NRL title in 43 years — making 36 tackles and running 225 metres.

He was in tears at the end, before being chaired off the pitch and becoming the first non-Australian to win the Clive Churchill Medal as man of the match in a Grand Final. 

Asked about the injury at half-time, he blurted out: 'It's f*****. It's gone.' After the game, he added: 'To be honest I couldn't feel the pain. I knew I'd broken it straight away. My face felt numb and I had blurred vision.'

Burgess twin brothers — Tom and George — also made telling impacts as their mother Julie watched in the stands. George went off with concussion in the first half but returned to score a vital try.
