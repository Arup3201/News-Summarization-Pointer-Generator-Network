Tiger Woods will miss the Masters next week and could be out for the rest of the summer as well after undergoing surgery for a herniated disc on Monday.

The 38-year-old revealed the stunning news in a statement on his website that not only ruled him out of Augusta but cast grave doubt on his participation for the US Open in June and also the season’s other two majors as well.

‘After attempting to get ready for the Masters and failing to make the necessary progress I decided, in consultation with my doctors, to have this procedure done,’ said Woods.

Ruled out: Woods will miss the Masters after undergoing back surgery

Masters: 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005

The Open: 2000, 2002, 2008

US Open: 2000, 2002, 2008

US PGA Championship: 1999, 2000, 2006, 2007

‘This is frustrating but it is 
something my doctors advised me to do for my immediate and long-term 
health. It looks like I will be forced to miss several upcoming 
tournaments to focus on my rehabilitation.’

This will be the first time Woods has 
missed the Masters since he competed as an amateur in 1995. He has been 
struggling on and off with his back since last August.

He withdrew from 
the Honda Classic at the beginning of last month with five holes to play
 and was clearly still in pain at the Cadillac Championship.

That
 was three weeks ago, during which time he had hoped rest and intense 
physio would do the trick. That all ended on Monday with microdiscectomy
 surgery in Park City, Utah.

Woods is hoping to be back chipping 
and putting by the end of this month but even if that happened he would 
still be a long way from being able to swing a driver, and a return to 
competition.

Where it all began: Woods receives the Masters green jacket from 1996 winner Nick Faldo in 1997

Rory McIlroy - 15/2

Adam Scott - 8/1

Phil Mickelson - 14/1

Jason Day - 18/1

Dustin Johnson - 20/1

The recovery period is listed as two to three months 
before someone can usually think about putting stress on the back, which
 would clearly leave him in a race against time to be ready for the 
summer programme.

Then there’s the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in 
September.

To play in that, he would almost certainly need a wild card 
and while captain Tom Watson would be happy to hand him one if he has 
fully recovered, would a man who has undergone such a delicate operation
 really want to risk being on a course in cold conditions in the heat of
 competition for 12 hours a day?

A bad back is the dread of every 
golfer. The surgery was described as successful on Woods’s website but 
the truth is there is no guarantee it will work when it comes to 
practising for hours at a time.

The specialist nature of the surgery and
 the fact this could prove career-defining was underlined by the fact he
 had the operation done 2,000 miles from his home in Florida. 

Unsteady: Woods injured his Achilles after playing from under the Eisenhower tree at the 2011 Masters

Crocked: Woods withdrew from the Players in 2011 after nine holes, left and the American played through the pain barrier on his way to winning the 2008 US Open

Carted off: Woods is driven off the course after picking up a neck injury at the Players in 2010

Red alert: Woods has been plagued with back problems in recent events

US Open: June 12-15

The Open: July 17-20

US PGA Championship: August 7-10

Whatever the outcome, this is unquestionably another massive blow for 
the world No 1, who was the most impressive athlete the sport had 
ever seen in his twenties  but who has been blighted by one injury after
 another in his thirties.

The most serious came in 2008, when he 
tore his anterior cruciate knee ligament and was out for eight months. 
He has also withdrawn from events owing to a damaged achilles and a bad 
neck.

This was supposed to be the year when Woods got back on the 
majors trail after a drought stretching back six years.

Three of the 
majors are being staged at venues where he has won while the fourth, the
 US Open, is at Pinehurst where he finished runner-up in 2005 and third 
in 1999.

Now his hopes for the year are up in the air and the 
long-term looks more uncertain than ever.

‘It’s tough right now, but 
I’m absolutely optimistic about the future,’ said a defiant Woods, as he
 contemplated the two great goals of his professional life – surpassing 
Sam Snead’s all-time record of 82 PGA Tour wins and Jack Nicklaus’s 
total of 18 majors.

Racking up the green: Woods won the Masters in 2005

Last triumph: Woods stands with runner-up Rocco Mediate after winning the US Open in 2008 after a play-off at Torrey Pines

Nice fit: Woods adjusts the Masters green jacket in 2002 after his win at Augusta

Silver service: Woods looks at the British Open trophy after his win in 2005

Triple crown: Woods celebrates winning his third Open title in 2006

Major force: Woods holds up the US Open trophy after his win in 2000, left, and 2002

While this injury would have to be virtually 
career-ending for Woods not to overtake Snead – he has 79 victories to 
his point – the number posted by the Golden Bear has never looked more 
out of reach since the day Tiger turned up at Augusta in 1997 and won 
his first major by 12 shots.

It had all looked set up perfectly 
for this season, too. Woods has played 65 majors and won 14 – exactly 
the same figures managed by Nicklaus at the same age. Now Woods needs to
 win either the US Open or the Open to keep pace but will he even get 
the chance?

Naturally, Woods isn’t remotely thinking of giving up 
the fight.

‘There are a couple of records by two outstanding individuals
 that I hope one day to break,’ he said. ‘As I’ve said many times, Sam 
and Jack reached their milestones over an entire career. I plan to have a
 lot of years left in mine.’

It was a rare note of optimism on a grim day not only for Woods but the sport itself.

June 2008: In obvious discomfort Woods plays through the pain to win the US Open at Torrey pines. Days later he undergoes anterior cruciate ligament surgery on his left knee while cartilage damage is also repaired. It later emerges he had also suffered a double stress fracture in his left tibia while preparing for the tournament.

December 2008: Woods suffers a ruptured Achilles tendon in his right leg and continues to be plagued by the injury the following year, although he does not reveal the problem until speaking about it at the 2010 Masters.

February 2009: Woods makes his return to action after nearly nine months out at the WGC Accenture Match Play Championship where he goes out in the second round after losing to Tim Clark.

August 2009: Woods, below, wins his 70th PGA event, finishing four shots ahead of Padraig Harrington and Robert Allenby in the WGC Bridgestone Invitational.

November 2009: Two days after a story breaks claiming Wood's had been unfaithful to wife Elin Nordegren, Woods hits the headlines after ploughing his Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and a tree outside his home in Isleworth, Florida. Initial reports claim that Woods was in a serious condition and his wife had used a golf club to smash the window of the car before dragging him clear.

December 2009: After a second woman comes forward claiming to have had an affair with Woods he admits to 'transgressions'. In the ensuing days more women claim to affairs with Woods prompting him release a statement on his website revealing he is to take 'indefinite leave' from golf to repair his marriage. Sponsors Accenture and AT&T announce they are severing their ties with Woods.

February 2010: Woods holds a press conference where he apologises for his 'irresponsible and selfish behaviour' and reveals he is undergoing therapy for the 'issues I am facing'. He does not confirm when he will make his golfing comeback.

March 2010: In a press statement Woods announces he will make a comeback at the Masters the following month.

April 2010: Woods' return at Augusta see him finish tied for fourth as Phil Mickelson wins the coveted green jacket.

May 2010: Having missed the cut the previous week at the Wells Fargo Championship, Woods withdraws during the final round of The Players Championship citing a neck injury.

August 2010: Woods and Nordegren are present at the Florida court as their divorce is finalised.

April 2011: Woods withdraws from the Wells Fargo Championship on precautionary grounds after suffering a minor injury to his left knee and Achilles tendon during the Masters earlier in the month.

May 2011: Woods withdraws from the Players Championship for the second year running, this time after just nine holes after recurrence of the ligament problems in his left knee and left Achilles tendon. Woods does not play again until August after missing both the US and British Open.

March 2012: The Achilles problem flairs up once more as Woods withdraws seven holes from the end of the WGC Cadillac Championship, although he is victorious at the Arnold Palmer Invitational a fortnight later.

June 2013: Following a lowly finish at the US Open, Woods, below, reveals he has been advised to 'take a few weeks off' to undergo treatment on a strain to his left elbow.

August 2013: Woods collapses to his knees in pain, clutching his back on the 13th hole of The Barclays in New Jersey. He recovers to finish second.

March 2014: After shooting a five over par 40 on the front nine, Woods withdraws during the final round of the Honda Classic as the backs spasms return to plague him.

April 2014: Woods reveals he has undergone surgery to repair a pinched nerve in his back and as a consequence will miss The Masters for the first time in his professional career. He states his intention to return in the summer.
