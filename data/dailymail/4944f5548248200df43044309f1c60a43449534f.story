Young parliamentary researchers last night claimed their parents would be ‘horrified’ if they knew the lurid truth of what goes on at the ‘Palace of Sexminster’.

One aide said there were rumours of MPs and peers using date rape drugs on junior activists, or paying for abortions after getting their staff pregnant.

Others claimed former ministers had been accused of manhandling women on the Commons terrace and that sex acts and drug-taking regularly took place in toilets. Yesterday there were calls for an urgent overhaul of Westminster’s late-night drinking culture to prevent more damaging sleaze scandals from engulfing Parliament.

The Palace of Westminster - or the 'Palace of Sexminster' as it's been dubbed after a string of scandals - is rife with rumours of MPs acting inappropriately towards their young staff members

The comments come two days after Nigel Evans, the former deputy speaker, was unanimously cleared of a series of sexual assaults.

The case shone a light on the drink-fuelled culture at Westminster – which has been labelled the ‘Palace of Sexminster’ after a string of sexual harassment allegations.

A study released at the end of the trial also found that a third of researchers said they had been subjected to harassment.

The claims come just two days after former deputy speaker Nigel Evans was unanimously cleared at the end of his trial for a string of sexual offences

Yesterday the Tory researcher who gave evidence against Mr Evans decided to lift the lid on the reality of life in ‘the Westminster bubble’.

He said colleagues – many of whom were straight out of university – were often so desperate to progress in their careers that they did not report sexual assaults.

The 35-year-old, who had claimed Mr Evans had put his hand down his trousers at a Conservative Party conference in 2003 but was brought to court despite insisting he was not a victim, added: ‘I think an awful lot of parents of people who work in Parliament would be horrified if they saw the reality of what life in the Westminster bubble is like.’

The Tory activist, who is married, added: ‘Parliament needs to get a grip on this alcohol-fuelled sleaze before it brews into something worse than the expenses scandal that destroys all trust in MPs. There is a problem and the politicians need to act. Otherwise a story will come out that starts an onslaught that makes the accusations we have heard in the last few weeks seem like small fry.’

He said politicians work long hours away from their families and are surrounded by ‘impressionable straight-out-of-university ambitious people’.

‘It’s a recipe for an awful lot of borderline people to be pushed over the edge and unfortunately that gives all MPs a bad name,’ he said.

He did not know if rumours of MPs using date rape drugs and paying for abortions were true, but said he heard allegations ‘all of the time’.

‘Most of these will be largely untrue, but there will be some reason why that rumour started in the first place,’ he added. ‘I think the sleazy nature of MPs hanging around with people who are just out of university, it does not look good.

‘We’re now living in an age when everyone’s got a camera in their pocket. At some point someone is going to take a photo in the Strangers’ Bar of someone behaving in a way they shouldn’t and it’s going to balloon and some very serious allegations will come forward, and by that point it will be too late and Parliament will have to act.’

Chief whip Sir George Young, left, wrote to MPs asking them to sign up to a code of ethics regarding the treatment of staff, while the Speaker, John Bercow, right, has set up a helpline for staff

He is now calling for bars in Parliament to have 9pm curfews for researchers. ‘You’ve got bars where people know each other, relatively cheap alcohol, and a lot of people who are up for a good gossip and like a bit of scandal,’ he added. ‘A lot of people like that atmosphere, but it is clearly causing problems.

‘Some parliamentary staff do actively encourage MPs to behave in a certain way, and the only reason MPs behave in that way is because on some occasions that behaviour may have resulted in “success”.’ Another man who made allegations about Mr Evans, who was unanimously cleared on all counts by a jury at Preston Crown Court on Thursday, said there was no proper way to deal with complaints.

He told Newsnight: ‘The strange thing about Parliament is that they make the laws but they don’t act like any other place of business.

Tory MP Sir Bob Stewart argued there was no need for a voluntary code of conduct

‘Researchers and MPs’ staff don’t have an HR department. Our bosses are technically self-employed and we’re all small businesses so even though we work in one big building together there was no mechanism to deal with this problem, and there still isn’t.’

Even last night there were rumours circulating Parliament that a former minister, who until recently was married, was reported to party whips after making a pass at a straight male MP. Two male researchers, now MPs, also allegedly fought after one said his drink was spiked and woke to find that he was being raped by the other.

Conservative party chiefs yesterday released a code of conduct for MPs. Sir George Young, the chief whip, wrote to MPs to urge them to sign up to the code, which said staff should be treated with ‘dignity, respect and courtesy’ and should be ‘free from any form of discrimination, victimisation, harassment or bullying’.

They should also not have to endure ‘unwelcome behaviour and inappropriate language’.

But it has been criticised for telling MPs that grievances are ‘entirely a matter for you to handle’. One researcher told the Mail: ‘How is that going to work? If you have a problem with your boss, you don’t exactly feel comfortable with telling them about it, particularly if your career is entirely in their hands.’

However, a Tory source said staff would still be able to go to a ‘pastoral care unit’ and would also be encouraged to speak to party whips. Commons Speaker John Bercow has also set up a helpline for staff.

Tory MP Sir Bob Stewart argued there was no need for a voluntary code of conduct and laughed it off, saying: ‘I’ve tried my best to behave.’

He told the BBC Daily Politics that boorish behaviour did not dominate the Commons, adding that ‘people act out of line in any profession’.

On Thursday, a Channel 4 News investigation named ‘The Palace of Sexminster’ found nearly a quarter of researchers from all parties had witnessed or heard about sex harassment.
