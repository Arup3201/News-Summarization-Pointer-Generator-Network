Australian Test cricketer Ryan Harris says he and his teammates were given 'a bit of closure' following Phillip Hughes' funeral service.

It came as the Australian Test squad touched down in Adelaide ahead of their first match since Hughes' death.

Harris said some of his teammates had not even thought about playing since Hughes' tragic death last Thursday after he was hit with a cricket ball in the neck.

'I know some guys have really struggled. Some haven't even picked up a bat or ball yet since it happened,' he wrote.

'They're just not going to know, until they pick a bat or ball up, whether or not they're going to be capable of playing.'

Harris said Hughes' funeral service was a turning point for the group, describing it as 'a bit of milestone'.

'As well as to pay your respects, it gives you a bit of closure. Now it's done I think there are a few more guys determined to get back on the park - but there's still a couple who are really hurting,' he said.

There has been a lot of speculation surrounding when young bowler Sean Abbott - the man who bowled the bouncer that struck Hughes - would return to action.

Since the incident, the cricketing community have rallied behind Abbott who was reportedly not coping well with his role in felling the batsman in the freak accident.

The young bowler was seen back at training on Friday but the NSW side will leave the decision about whether or not he will play against Queensland up to the 21-year-old, news.com.au reported.

Harris said the importance of Australia playing against India on Tuesday only hit home while he and thousands of other cricketing stars, family and friends walked behind Hughes' hearse

In that moment of realisation, Harris said he tapped teammate Mitchell Johnson on the arm and said: 'Far out, this is why we've got to play next week'

If Abbott does decide to step up to the crease again also on Tuesday for round five of the Sheffield Shield, he will do so on the same field, Sydney Cricket Ground, where his bouncer struck Hughes last Tuesday.

Harris said the importance of Australia playing against India on Tuesday only hit home while he and thousands of other cricketing stars, family and friends walked behind Hughes' hearse following the service at Macksville High School hall - on New South Wales' mid-north coast.

He said seeing all the people lining the streets of the 2,600-strong town to farewell Hughes 'really struck a chord' with him.

In that moment of realisation, Harris said he tapped teammate Mitchell Johnson on the arm and said: 'Far out, this is why we've got to play next week'.

A series of staggered arrivals in Adelaide have started ahead of Tuesday's Test match against India.

The Marsh brothers - Mitch and Shaun - landed in the South Australian capital along with Mitchell Johnson, Ryan Harris, Steve Smith and Chris Rogers on Thursday afternoon. 

Shaun Marsh was a late addition to the squad, covering for captain Michael Clarke who will not be playing because of a hamstring injury.

Tragically, Hughes was tipped to replace his close friend in the lead up to the first Test match in Brisbane, which was cancelled following his death.
