Brazil came from behind to see off France in a friendly at the Stade de France, with goals from Chelsea midfielder Oscar, Barcelona forward Neymar, and Wolfsburg defensive midfielder Luis Gustavo.

France had taken the lead through a Raphael Varane header, and looked to be in total control before Oscar's well-worked equaliser, but the visitors fought back strongly in the second half, and could have scored more as the game wore on.

Neymar who already had 42 goals for his country before this game, made it 43, firing past Steve Mandanda from an angle which will have disappointed the French keeper, before Luis Gustavo was given the run of the penalty area to head home from a corner.

And that's it. Brazil come from behind in style to seal a 3-1 win against France and gain a tiny bit of revenge for their World Cup final defeat 17 years ago.

Raphael Varane gave the hosts the lead with a powerful header but strikes from Oscar, Neymar and Luis Gustavo secured a deserved victory for Dunga's men.

The Real Madrid man gets up and limps back but it looks like he's OK. Brazil's subs still working hard to close down France every time they get the ball. They've seen this out well.

Fernandinho replaces goalscorer Gustavo with just added time remaining. Four minutes extra to be played.

And off goes Firmino after a bit of discussion. 

Almost a debut to remember for Fekir as he picks the ball up on the edge of the box, creates some space and gets a low shot away which flashes just wide.

Souza replaces Oscar.

Schneiderlin bursts down the left and goes down after being clipped by Danilo. The Southampton man wants a free-kick but the referee isn't having it. Goal kick.

Douglas Costa comes on for Willian and Giroud replaces Matuidi.

Payet replaces Valbuena with just under 10 minutes to play.

Neymar skips away from Schneiderlin, drives towards goal but blasts his shot high and wide from a little over 20 yards. To be fair to him the ball appeared to bobble as he struck it.

Kondogbia replaces Sissoko and Fekir comes on for Griezmann.

And there's number three! Gustavo gets away from his marker and heads the corner beyond Mandanda and into the corner. Awful defending but Brazil probably deserve a two-goal cushion.

The visitors move up the pitch at speed with Willian and Neymar both involved. The Barca man picks out Oscar and his curled shot forces Mandanda into a diving save to his left. Corner for Brazil.

Some neat skill and a long-range shot from Griezmann forces Jefferson into a fingertip save - possibly his best of the game. Valbuena delivers another good corner but Brazil deal with it.

Within a minute of Varane's miss - with a Jefferson save from Sissoko sandwiched in between - Benzema misses a sitter. A deep cross found the Real Madrid man unmarked at the back post but he leant back and volleyed well over the bar. It really hasn't been his night so far.

Another dangerous free-kick from France goes all the way through to Varane but he doesn't connect with his shot properly and the ball rolls harmlessly wide.

Told you they were starting to play! Willian is involved again and he drives down the middle before laying in Neymar on the left. The Barcelona man takes a couple of touches before lashing the ball high into the net from an acute angle.

Brazil starting to play with some style now. They work the ball around France's half before Willian tries to play a killer ball to Neymar. France clear for a corner which Silva almost converts.

Sakho loses his footing and Brazil pick up the ball in a dangerous area. It's played into the centre and Gustavo strikes a low shot from about 20 yards which Mandanda does well to save. 

This time Valbuena picks up possession on the left side of Brazil's box. He makes himself some space and tries to pick out Benzema but his cross is poor and Jefferson claims again.

Sissoko bursts through midfield and is brought down by Elias 45 yards from goal. Valbuena curls the free-kick into the area but it goes all the way through to Jefferson.

France get the second period underway. 

How many substitutions we will see in the second half? I'm going for 10.

France are struggling to get hold of the ball as the first half draws to a close. Willian combines with Danilo but the right back's pass inside is poor and France clear the danger. 

Lovely goal. Oscar picks up the ball on the left, plays it inside to Firmino and drives into the box looking for the return. The Hoffenheim man prods it into his path and Oscar produces a low finish with his first touch. Game on.

Willian runs on to a pass down Brazil's right, takes a touch and delivers a cross. Brazil are lacking a physical presence up-front and it's obvious here as Mandanda claims under no pressure whatsoever. 

Firmino picks up the ball in a central area and drives forward. He makes some progress but is eventually crowded out and loses possession on the edge of France's area.

Firmino certainly isn't afraid to have a go from distance. This time he picks the ball up about 25 yards from goal and forces Mandanda into a decent save low to his right. Neymar takes the resulting corner but France clear up.

...but this time Brazil just about deal with it. Sakho got up to meet it but his header looped up and into the hands of Jefferson. Brazil now have a free-kick inside France's half after a foul on Neymar...

Elias finds some space 25 yards from goal but his shot is high and wide. Should've got his head up and picked a pass, there.

France take the lead! Another inswinging corner from Valbuena is met powerfully by Varane and his header flies into the bottom corner. Nobody on either post for Brazil. 

First real chance of the game for Brazil. Neymar receives a pass just inside the area, uses a defender as a shield and attempts to pass the ball into the bottom corner. Mandanda is equal to it though, palming the ball away.

Another mini spell of possession for Brazil but it ends when Oscar inexplicably fires a long pass across the pitch to absolutely nobody. 

Poor challenge from Filipe Luis, who scythes down the little midfielder from behind. The Chelsea man escapes a booking, probably because it's a friendly.

Neymar closes down France's defence and makes an interception but the ball gets away from him and the hosts survive a scare. 

The visitors are starting to get on the ball a bit more now. Neymar drops deep to pick up possession but he's eventually crowded out and loses the ball in a dangerous area. Moments later Firmino finds some space on the edge of France's box but his low strike is blocked.

Valbuena whips in a corner which falls to Benzema just a few yards from goal. The Real Madrid was completely unmarked but he couldn't direct his header past Jefferson, who palmed his effort away and hurt himself in the process. France should have the lead.

Lighting run from Willian down the right. The Chelsea man gets past one opponent but a brilliant sliding tackle from Schneiderlin takes the ball away from him.

Willian appeared to catch Blaise Matuidi but it's the Brazilian who is left on the turf. No need for treatment and he's back in the game after being helped to his feet.

Brazil haven't had possession since Neymar lost his footing - and the ball - inside the first minute. Bacary Sagna and Raphael Varane both involved early on but no chances yet.

Brazil get us underway at the Stade de France.

France, Brazil and everyone inside the stadium take part in a minute of silence in respect to those who lost their lives in the Germanwings plane crash this week. Perfectly observed.

Both sets of players are out on the pitch and lined up for the national anthems. The stadium appears pretty packed considering it's a friendly - looks like Brazil still have plenty of pulling power despite that defeat to Germany last summer.

Four minutes until kick-off.

Martha Kelner: The conclusion of a football match, particularly monumental ones like the World Cup final, often brings new debate and inquiry, questions about players, tactics and refereeing decisions.

Very rarely do they result in a government investigation. Yet that is exactly what happened after Brazil's capitulation in the 1998 final against hosts France.

Quite what transpired in the hours before the match, particularly with star player Ronaldo who was taken to hospital and left off the teamsheet only to be reinstated before kick-off, is one of football's most enduring mysteries.

Kieran Gill: The way the unofficial World Cup final works is not unlike a game of conkers, where winner takes all until your next match in an all-or-nothing scenario.

Brazil have held the unofficial title since October 11, when they beat Argentina 2-0 in Beijing, China, and have a chance to chase Scotland at the top of the unofficial World Cup ranking table.

They have some way to go, however, as Scotland sit top with 86 points, ahead of England on 73.

Sam Cunningham: Brazil responded to World Cup humiliation, shipping 10 goals in their final two games, by bringing back one of their grittiest former captains.

Dunga was handed the responsibility of rebuilding a fallen team from the ashes of a 7-1 semi-final defeat by Germany and 3-0 loss at the hands of Holland.

His appointment was a controversial one among Brazil supporters, having guided his country in a lacklustre 2010 World Cup before he was sacked the last time.
