A New Hampshire man has lost his life savings on a carnival game, and he walked away with a massive stuffed banana with dreadlocks to show for it.

Henry Gribbohm bet a total of $2,600 on the game, called Tubs of Fun, during a day out at the Manchester carnival on Saturday. The touring carnival is run by New Hampshire-based Fiesta Shows.

But the 30-year-old father now claims the game was rigged and has filed a police report with Manchester Police Department, which is now investigating the incident for potential fraud.

'Rigged': Henry Gribbohm bet a total of $2,600 on the game, Tubs of Fun, during a day out at the Manchester carnival run by New Hampshire-based Fiesta Shows on Saturday

'You're expecting the kids to win a few things, let the kids have a good time,' Gribbohm told WBZ-TV. 'It just didn't turn out that way.'

The man said he was hoping to win an Xbox Kinect on the game, which requires contestants to toss balls into a tub.

He says the game was simple when he practiced, but when he started playing for the prize something changed and the balls kept popping out of the tubs.Â

'It's not possible that it wasn't rigged,' he insists.

The Epsom-based father told WBZ-TV he kept trying to win back his money by going double or nothing on the same game but instead he lost $300 in just a few minutes.

Then he went home to get $2,300 more - the rest of the money to his name - and soon lost all of that as well.

'You just get caught up in the whole "I've got to win my money back,"' he told WBZ-TV.

He says he went back the following day and complained and the game operator game him $600 but he then filed a report with the local police.

According to Fiesta Shows, Tubs of Fun is run by an independent contractor who has worked for the carnival company for years.

Fiesta told WBZ-TV it is interviewing the contractor to 'get to the bottom of what happened.' The game is not being set up at the upcoming carnival in Derry, New Hampshire.

Gribbohm admits he 'fell for it' but says he never expected such a thing to happen at a kids' carnival.

'For once in my life, I became that sucker,' he says.
