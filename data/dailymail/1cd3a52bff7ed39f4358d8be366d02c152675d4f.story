Meet Chicky - the dolphin who has been taught how to paint.

Frank Sanchez, 40, trained the animal to jump out of the water and grasp a paint brush in her mouth.

Also known as 'Chicasso', the animal then takes the brush and moves it against a canvas to create her colourful abstract masterpieces.

Artistic: Animal trainer Frank Sanchez has managed to teach Chicky the dolphin, pictured, how to paint

Painter: Chicky has been taught to jump out of the water before grasping a paintbrush in her mouth

Mr Sanchez, who has been working with marine mammals since 1989, first met Chicky when he was working in Switzerland.

She was one of seven animals that Mr Sanchez was training - and, according to the man, was the smartest of the bunch.

Mr Sanchez has now moved to work on the French Riviera, while Chicky remains in Switzerland.

The trainer has also worked with sea lions, penguins, flamingos, and 
even taught a killer whale to jump and take a fish from his mouth during his long career.

Mr Sanchez said: 'It took a lot of time and effort to teach Chicky to paint.

'She was cleverer than the six other dolphins I worked with at the time so I wanted to see if she could learn to hold the paint brush and make her own strokes.

Masterpiece: The animal then uses the brush to create her colourful pieces of art

Remarkable: Mr Sanchez, pictured, says Chicky often pauses while painting to admire her work

'I was so impressed with the results. And she must enjoy it or she wouldn't have done it.

'Like with humans, there are smart dolphins and stupid dolphins. I knew Chicky was the only one capable of learning what I wanted her to do.

'I've seen a lot of others teaching dolphins to paint, but I wanted to push it further and try something different.

'I wanted to see if she would hold the paintbrush and go to the canvas herself and the result is incredible.

Voila! Chicky's final version of the painting is displayed on poolside

Hobby: Mr Sanchez, who has now moved to France, says he hopes the dolphin will continue to paint regularily

'You can see her stopping between strokes to look at the canvas to see what she's done.

'Chicky even started painting without me rewarding her with fish.'

The dolphin will now be relocated to Italy.

Mr Sanchez said: 'Chicky the painting dolphin will soon be relocated to one of the marine mammal facilities in Italy.

'I do hope to be able to work with her again one day though. I am sure she will still enjoy painting again too.'
