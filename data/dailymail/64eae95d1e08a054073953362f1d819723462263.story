A prisoner broke out of jail after getting so fed up of hearing loud rap music being played ‘day and night’ on his wing, a court heard.

Robert Stevens, 58, became so annoyed with the constant hip hop music played by his fellow inmates that he fled HMP Leyhill prison in Gloucestershire.

The convicted robber also became distressed by being ‘constantly pestered’ to buy drugs off younger cellmates inside, the court heard.

Stevens simply climbed over a security wall to escape the minimum security category D jail before walking several miles to the nearest town.

The fugitive, who had been serving a six-and-a-half year sentence for robbery, spent 20 days at large in various towns in the South West.

Police issued a public appeal to find him and he was finally caught while visiting a Coral bookmakers in Bridport, Dorset, on March 29.

Jamie Porter, defending, said: ‘He was in a very noisy wing where rap music was being played day and night.

‘He was also being constantly pestered to purchase drugs by younger cellmates.

Stevens was sent to the minimum security HMP Leyhill prison in Gloucestershire, pictured, in 2012 for carrying out a string of commercial robberies, including at a Coral bookmakers in Bath

‘Stevens has apologised for his behaviour. It was an impulsive act on his part.

‘It is quite clear he does not wish to commit any more crime.’

He said his client was about to hand himself in when he was recognised and arrested.

In sentencing Stevens, Judge Roger Jarvis said his escape was ‘impulsive and opportunistic’.

He said: ‘The reason for your escape has been explained to me as your unhappiness at people who were with you in prison.

‘I’m afraid that’s one of the prices people pay if they commit crimes and go to prison.

‘Those who escape from prison have to be sentenced in a way that is a deterrent to other prisoners.’

Stevens complained of loud rap music being played 'day and night' at HMP Leyhill prison and blamed it as the reason for absconding. The music could have included songs by rap artist Eminem, left, or Dizzee Rascal, right

Stevens admitted the charge of escaping from HMP Leyhill and was given an extra 
10 months to serve on top of his current sentence.

Dorchester Crown Court heard that Stevens has 21 convictions for 45 offences spanning four decades.

In 2012 he was sent to HMP Leyhill for carrying out a string of commercial robberies, including at a Coral bookmakers in Bath, Somerset.
