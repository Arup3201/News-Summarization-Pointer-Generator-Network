Mark Cavendish has issued a typically blunt assessment of the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report into past practices of doping and suggested Lance Armstrong's charity return to the Tour de France 'could be done in a different environment'.

CIRC was established to investigate whether the UCI, cycling's world governing body, was complicit in past doping practices, such as the Armstrong affair, which saw the American stripped of his seven Tour titles and banned for life.

Some of the reports findings were scathing but, according to 2011 world champion and 25-time Tour stage winner Cavendish, little was revelatory. 

Mark Cavendish says there were few revelations in the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report 

The 25-time Tour de France stage winner said the report was 'all the s*** that's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document'

Cavendish, speaking after announcing he'll compete in August's Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic, said: 'To be brutally honest, I don't really think there's anything new in there.

'There's all the s*** that's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document.

'People talk about the past of cycling like it's the present. It's a little bit frustrating; that would be an understatement.

'As long as cycling's cleaning up and I'm racing in a fair playing field in a sport I love, then I'll continue to be happy with that.'

One unnamed but 'respected' professional cyclist told CIRC that 90 per cent of the professional peloton continues to dope, while another reported the figure was 20 per cent.

Cavendish did not confirm if he had read the report in full or just the media dispatches which followed its publication earlier this month.

He did not speak to CIRC and was unaware that riders could approach the commission to share their views.

Asked if he felt the report represented the views of the modern peloton, Cavendish said: 'Absolutely not. I really don't. I wasn't asked at all to say anything.

'Ninety-five per cent of the peloton will know the one rider who will have said certain comments and the other five per cent won't have raced or known that rider, so couldn't comment on it.

'I think certain quotes from unreliable sources don't really mean anything and completely warp the sense of the whole process.'

Armstrong plans to return to the Tour alongside former footballer Geoff Thomas, another cancer survivor.

Thomas is riding the Tour route one day ahead of the professional peloton, which includes Cavendish, to raise funds for charity and has invited Armstrong to join him.

Cavendish said: 'There's no denying what Lance did for charity; he did work a lot for charity.

'But maybe this situation could be done in a different environment.'
