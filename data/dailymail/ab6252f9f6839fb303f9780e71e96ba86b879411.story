The terrorist ex-husband of a 19-year-old Dutch jihadist rescued from Syria by her mother says she lived a happy life among Islamic extremists, cooking, going to tea parties and doing 'girl stuff'.

The girl, who has only been named as Aicha, was arrested after her mother brought her back to the Netherlands and is suspected of joining a terrorist organisation, meaning she could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted.

Her mother, Monique Verbert, rescued her daughter from Syria after reports that she had been treated 'like a slave' by the jihadists, but Aicha's former husband Omar Yilmaz painted a very different picture.

Yilmaz, who married Aicha after she became infatuated with him, told the Sunday Times that she lived a pleasant life as a housewife in Syria.

He said: 'She would spend most of the day either at home or with our neighbours. Cooking food, tea parties ... girl stuff.'

He said the pair split up amicably after a few months together.

'We both knew it wasn't going to work,' he said. 'I have her her dues ... and went on with my jihad.

'I never harmed her. When she was married to me ... she had contact with her family daily.' 

But Aicha is reported to have told Turkish media that Yilmaz, who is said to have served in the Dutch military, used her 'like a slave and threw me away'.

Yilmaz, chatting on an instant messaging app, did not mention why he and the 19-year-old split up, but said he thought she had remarried a Tunisian fighter since they divorced.

Aicha fled to Syria in February last year after months of chatting with Yilmaz online.

Ms Verbert said Aicha changed her name and started wearing a niqab after converting to Islam.

The teenager first contacted Yilmaz after she was 'completely impressed' by a video he posted on the internet.

Ms Verbert, speaking on Dutch television in September, said: 'She basically saw him as a sort of Robin Hood ... that he was a nice man and fought against [Syrian President] Assad.

'She said again and again: "Mum, look at that guy - isn't it good what he does?"

'She's a very sweet, sensitive girl.'

Aicha is being held in solitary confinement, but Dutch journalist Johan van Beek said the teenager may have 'experienced things that might have traumatic effects'.

He said: 'If that is the case they will send in experts to deprogramme her. If it is clear she's a victim, which is very possible, she'll have psychological help to help get back into society.' 

About 130 Dutch jihadists have gone to fight in Syria. Around 30 have since returned and 14 have been killed.
