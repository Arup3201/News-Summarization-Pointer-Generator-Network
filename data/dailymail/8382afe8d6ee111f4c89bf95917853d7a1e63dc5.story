A Washington mother who was told her daughter died in a car accident over the weekend, got a shock of relief when she went to examine the young woman's body on Wednesday and realized it wasn't the 24 year old.

Lori Baker was told by a police chaplain Monday that her daughter died in Spanaway on March 14 when a soldier driving a pick-up truck hit her crossing the street.

At the time, Baker asked to see her daughter but was told it was a 'bio-hazard' and that she would have to wait for the body to be released to a funeral home.

So Baker went on with the funeral preparations, writing an obituary and the painful process of informing family - including her 7-year-old granddaughter Abigail - that she had died.

Baker went to Mt View Funeral home in Lakewood on Wednesday with her sister when the body was finally realeased by the medical examiner.

'My sister went in with me holding my hand and we both screamed at the same time, it’s not her!' Baker told KIRO TV.

Her shock quickly turned to outrage when the weight of her premature mourning washed over her.

You can't see her: When Baker asked to see her daughter, the medical examiner said no because it was a 'bio-hazard'. She had to wait for the body to be released to a funeral home and that's when she realized the victim wasn't Kennedy

Inked: The medical examiner identified the car crash victim's body as Kennedy using descriptions of the young woman's tattoos her friends gave

'How can you go around telling people their kid is dead without proof?' Baker asked.

The body was later returned to the medical examiner's office and properly identified as 25-year-old Jane Aubrey Peterson.

The Pierce County Medical Examiner's Office released a statement following the misidentification Wednesday, explaining the mix-up.

The medical examiner was contacted by friends of Kennedy after the crash, who believed the victim was their friend since she had been missing for a few days.

One of her friends described a tattoo Kennedy had and the medical examiner matched it on the victim's body and identified her that way.

While the medical examiner's office does use more precise ways of identifying dead bodies, such as through fingerprinting, dental records and DNA, they are not used unless necessary because they 'are time-consuming,expensive and create delays that are burdensome on families'.

Still missing: Lori Baker (right) says she's had sporadic contact with her daughter since she left the home at age 16. Kennedy is still missing and Baker is now aiding in the search

'In most cases, identification can be resolved by driver's licenses and family identification of distinctive features, such as tattoos.'

However, the medical examiner says they will be adjusting their practices in light of this incident.

'I don’t think anyone did anything wrong. It was a simple misunderstanding,' Dr Thomas Clark told the News Tribune.  'The appropriate response is to adjust your policies and practices to ensure something like this does not happen again. We are reviewing the circumstances and will adjust our practices.'

Meanwhile Samantha Kennedy is still missing. Baker says she's been in sporadic contact with her daughter since she left home at the age of 16, but is now aiding in the search for the missing woman.

'I still don’t know where my daughter is, but at least I know she’s not the one who was killed,' Baker said. 'I’m really relieved.'
