A pub tribute singer is being sued by the Bat Out of Hell star Meat Loaf for £64,000 claiming he's an 'online imposter'.

Dean Torkington, 50, from Burnley, Lancashire, has received a $100,000 writ (£64,000) from the US rocker, which accuses him of being a 'cybersquatter and online imposter'.

The legal action, launched in Los Angeles, California, centres on Mr Torkington’s website www.meatloaf.org.

Writ: Dean Torkington, 49, from Burnley, Lancashire, performing left in 2002, has received a $100,000 writ (£65,000) from the US rocker Meat Loaf, right, accusing him of being a 'cybersquatter and online imposter'

Full-time performer Mr Torkingon, a divorcee, has been a Meatloaf tribute act since 1996 and 
performs at pubs and clubs across the UK. He claims to have had the 
www.meatloaf.org domain name for 12 years.

Meat Loaf, 65, has the website www.meatloaf.net.

He is a huge fan of the star - famed for
his 1981 hit Dead Ringer For Love - and has even met him backstage at 
one of the singer's gigs in Liverpool.

A writ issued by LA law firm 
Lavely & Singer, using Meat Loaf’s real name Michael Aday, names Mr 
Torkington as a 'cybersquatter and online imposter'.

The writ claims Mr Torkington has 'commercially 
exploited the internet top-level domain name MeatLoaf.org to capitalise 
on the artist’s celebrity'. It goes on to claim Mr Torkington is 'liable for substantial damages,
including statutory damages of up to $100,000 for your cybersquatting'.

Cybersquatting means using a domain name
in bad faith where the user is trying to profit from the goodwill of a 
trademark belonging to someone else.

On his website Mr Torkington, who goes under
the name 'To Hell and Back' and whose shows feature a real motorbike 
and big artwork back drops, state: 'You simply won't find a more 
accurate portrayal of the Rock God Meat Loaf anywhere else.'

The writ, launched in California, claims Mr Torkington (pictured left as Meat Loaf and right off stage) is 'liable for substantial damages' and he claims the dispute has led to the one-time devoted fan diversifying his act

Multi-million selling artist Meat Loaf is
famous for hits Bat Out Of Hell, Dead Ringer For Love and I’d Do 
Anything for Love (But I Won’t Do That).

Mr Torkington, who has toured with his show To Hell And Back: (A Tribute To Meatloaf) for the past 16 years, said he was shocked at claims.

He said the dispute has led to the one-time devoted fan diversifying his act. His Legends of Rock show now includes tributes to Elton John, Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi.

Mr Torkington also says the fact that he’s shed 11 stone in the last two years means he could no longer be considered a 'dead ringer'.

Controversy: Mr Torkington says he's used the domain name since 2000 and makes clear it's a tribute act

He said: 'Earlier this month I received a copy of the lawsuit posted to my home and emailed. I have every intention of defending this to protect my good name and will not be bullied in this way.

'I really don’t see what his gripe is or legally where he is coming from, I am not guilty of cyber squatting or passing myself off as him.'

Mr Torkington travels to gigs in a van adorned with Meat Loaf images.

He said he is now trying to re-launch his career with the new show after shedding around 11 stone since 2010.

Mr Torkington said that this is not the 
first time that Meatloaf has tried to sue him - in 2003 he claimed the 
singer dragged him back stage at his concert in Liverpool and told him 
to get rid of his van which has Bat Out Of Hell album artwork on the 
side.

He said he also offered Meat Loaf his domain name for £8,000 - but was offered £1,300.

Mr Torkington, who lives alone, said: 'I'm seeing my barrister 
because there's a legal term that states if he knew about me and has 
done nothing before he cannot complain later on.'

Mr Torkington added: 'I have been a 
Meatloaf tribute performer since 1996. I used to be an Elton John 
performer before that but put on quite a bit of weight so decided to 
become Meatloaf.

'I would emulate him as best I could. I 
have a full stage set with a motorbike and a big picture of the album 
cover Bat Out Of Hell 2 at the back.'

He added: 'We have not got on for a long time. He said that he wanted my website www.Meatloaf.org. He's never made it easy for me.

'Once I paid £400 on VIP tickets to see 
Meat Loaf at Liverpool Docks. He came in his big tour bus and I came in 
my van with the Bat out of Hell artwork on the side.

'I was on the front row and we were due 
to meet the band after the show. During one of the songs I got a tap on 
my shoulder and this guy tells me that Meat Loaf wanted to meet me after 
the show.

'I went back stage and I had him and his
manager having a go at me. He said that he wanted to get all the 
pictures off the side of my van and also he wanted my website address.

'I told him that he was not having my 
website but shortly after that his YouTube channel complained about my 
YouTube videos of my show and I had to take mine down.

'I have taken this show all over the 
country and promoted him well in all these years. I have done charity 
gigs too. But when the person that you are portraying is making your 
life hell it makes you question whether you still want to be like them.

'I just wanted him to say that he 
thought that it was good but he never has. My webpage has always said 
that I am a tribute act. I have never tried to say that I am Meat Loaf 
himself.

'I've gone back to doing Elton John 
tribute acts more now as a result of all this. It's less hassle than 
being a Meatloaf tribute act any day.'

Mr Torkington, whose next show is at the Crown Paints Social Club, Darwen on Saturday, July 28, added: 'There are no court dates set and I believe they have to serve me the writ in person for that.

'It wouldn’t surprise me if they did it while I was on stage in Darwen.'
