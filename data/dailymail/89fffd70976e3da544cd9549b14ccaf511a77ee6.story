Roy Keane has revealed he turned down the chance to succeed Neil Lennon as Celtic manager in the summer because the Parkhead club failed to make him feel wanted enough.

The former Manchester United midfielder was left disappointed by a take it or leave it contract offer packed full of unappealing clauses that 'failed to rock my boat’.

The inflexible and cut-price nature of the negotiations over the manager’s job with the Scottish champions reminded Keane of the club playing on his affections when negotiating his deal to sign as a player in 2005.

Roy Keane played for Celtic between 2005 and 2006 but turned down the chance to manage the club

Keane, pictured here in his testimonial match in 2006, said Celtic didn't make him feel wanted this summer 

An unimpressed Keane was left thinking: ‘They were playing the part — 'It’s Celtic' — you should almost go up there for nothing.

‘Celtic wanted me but they weren’t showing how much they wanted me.’

And a non-negotiable decision to appoint his right-hand-man — thought to be under-pressure current boss Ronny Deila — also left the fiery Irishman feeling Celtic had doubts over his ability, even though he had been offered the job by majority shareholder Dermot Desmond.

Speaking in his new autobiography The Second Half, the 43-year-old recalled the moment Celtic made their move in late May.

‘I got a call: would I go and have a chat with Dermot Desmond? I’d met him once before, in 2005, when I was signing to play for Celtic.

‘I met him for a cup of tea. It was in the middle of an international week, in Dublin.

Keane believes Celtic thought the club's reputation on its own would be enough to lure him back to Parkhead

‘At the end of the chat, he said: 'The job is yours'.

‘It was all pretty straightforward. There would be one or two restrictions, about staff. They had already picked the man who would be my assistant and they were insisting on him.

‘It didn’t scare me off but it did get me thinking. It wasn’t an ideal start. Were they doubting me already?

‘I came back to the team hotel and spoke to Martin (O’Neill). I told him I would have a think about it.

‘We (the Republic of Ireland) had a game against Italy at Craven Cottage in London on the following Saturday.

After turning down the Celtic manager's job, Keane joined Aston Villa as Paul Lambert's assistant manager

‘The fact I had spoken to Dermot Desmond had become public knowledge.

‘It had to, because Martin had a press conference and a few things had been leaked — as usual.

‘I was delighted. It was a massive compliment. Over the years, I had always said: “If you’re offered the Celtic job, you don’t turn it down”.

‘I was in a predicament ...and my gut feeling was saying: 'You’re on your own with this one'.

Keane's  book is as fiery as his first autobiography

‘I asked Paul Gilroy, the League Managers’ Association lawyer, to speak to Celtic to discuss terms. Money hadn’t been mentioned yet.

‘I got in touch with Celtic’s chief executive, Peter Lawwell and asked him to give me a ballpark figure before negotiations got going.

‘He mentioned a figure and he said: 'But that’s it'. Paul told me there were a lot of clauses in the contract that he wasn’t happy with. And the figures were non-negotiable.

‘I got my head around that. But it felt a bit too familiar. I had been down this road before when I signed for Celtic as a player.

‘I felt they wanted me but they weren’t showing how much they wanted me.

‘We played Italy on the Saturday and I had a message on my phone on Sunday from Dermot Desmond.

‘They wanted a heads-up by tomorrow, Monday.

‘I thought about the Celtic offer. It wasn’t rocking my boat.

‘They weren’t convincing me: 'Listen, you’re the man for us'.

‘I went to Paul Gilroy’s house (on Sunday night). There were things I wasn’t happy with in the contract. But I know if you examined every clause too carefully, you would never sign anything.

‘I rang Dermot Desmond on the Monday and said: 'I’m really honoured you offered me the job but I want to stay with Martin'.’

Keane would later take up an offer to coach at Aston Villa under former Celtic captain Paul Lambert.

But he denied that any such potential job offers were behind his decision to turn down Celtic.

He also spoke of his dismay that Celtic did not prove flexible enough to persuade him to change his mind when he turned down their initial unacceptable offer.

The new book reveals how badly Keane fell out with former Manchester United  boss Sir Alex Ferguson

He said: ‘Had Celtic shown enough in their negotiating, 'we’ll move this, you can take that' — a bit of give and take — I might have hesitated.

‘They just didn’t show me that they wanted me and I was happier staying in the Ireland job.

‘Working with Martin had given me back a love of the game and I’m all for showing a bit of loyalty.

‘I had only been in the job two minutes. We hadn’t played a competitive game yet.

‘I felt powerful saying: 'No'. I felt good. But I wondered if I was making the right decision.

‘Right job, wrong time.’
