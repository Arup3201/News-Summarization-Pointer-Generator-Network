Mystery: The naked and decomposing body of Gareth Williams, 31, was found locked inside a holdall in the bath of his home in Pimlico, central London, in August 2010

Evidence that could hold the key to 
the mystery of the spy found dead in a padlocked sports bag might have been
wiped from his computers before they were given to police, it has been claimed.

MI6 spy Gareth Williams's family fear 
British agents filtered out potential clues when they wiped data to conceal details of 
his classified work after his untimely death.

According to the pre-inquest hearing held last
week, Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command examined all of Mr 
Williams's computers before handing them to murder detectives.

But Mr Williams's family have raised 
questions about the role of the command - codenamed SO15 - in the 
inquiry and want a witness from the squad to explain its role.

Coroner Fiona 
Wilcox: 'The family have expressed concerns to this court and 
want clarification of the role of SO15 in this inquiry.

'I hope a witness from SO15 can attend and explain,' she added, according to the Daily Mirror.

She confirmed that 'all computers, IT and phones were examined first by SO15' before they were handed over to the murder squad.

The discovery of Mr Williams's body in
his flat near the Secret Service headquarters in London sparked a 
20-month police inquiry that has so far drawn a blank.

Mr Williams's family last week said they believe their son may have been killed by a secret agent. Their barrister suggested a sinister cover-up had left them with no way of knowing how and Mr Williams died.

Security experts have agreed that the 
death had all the hallmarks of a professional killing, suggesting that a
Russian or Iranian hit squad may have been involved.

It emerged at the inquest last week that the flat may have been swept clean of evidence, with no fingerprints or DNA anywhere.

It was also revealed that – far from 
being a back-office worker – Mr Williams had just completed training for
deployment on operations.

Other revelations included:

Suspicions: Relatives believe a third party was either present when Gareth Williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence, lawyer Anthony O'Toole said

The naked body of the super-fit 
maths prodigy was found in a large padlocked North Face bag in the bath 
of his Government-owned Pimlico flat in August 2010.

The codebreaker from Anglesey, North 
Wales, was said to have links to London's bondage and gay scene and it 
had already been suggested a sex game, possibly with a colleague, may 
have had a tragic end.

But Westminster Coroner Dr Fiona 
Wilcox has heard that his grieving family fear whoever is responsible has 
expertly covered up the evidence.

Their barrister Anthony O'Toole 
rejected the conclusion of an internal MI6 inquiry that Mr Williams's 
death 'had nothing to do with his work'.

He said: 'There is a high probability 
that some third party was in the flat when Gareth was placed in the bag.
Evidentially there seems to be no trace of an unknown party in the 
flat.

'Our impression is that the unknown third party was a member of some agency specialising in the dark arts or secret services.

'Or perhaps evidence has been removed from the scene post-mortem by experts in those arts.'

Mr Williams, pictured riding his bike, was found dead inside a body bag similar to the one pictured, right

Mr Williams, an expert in cyber 
defences, was nearing the end of a one-year secondment from the GCHQ 
listening station to the headquarters of the Secret Intelligence 
Service, or MI6, in Vauxhall, London.

Shortly before his death he had 
returned from a clandestine visit to Washington where he had worked 
alongside U.S. agents in operations to counter infiltrations by Chinese 
and Russian computer hackers.

Mr Williams's body was discovered by 
police at his flat on August 23, 2010. He was found naked inside a 
red North Face holdall, which was padlocked on the outside and placed 
inside his bath.

A wide-ranging and highly sensitive 
police inquiry has left many questions unanswered over the circumstances
of his death, Dr Wilcox heard.

Experts believe it would have been 
'difficult, if not impossible' for Mr Williams to lock himself in the 
bag but can find no evidence of anyone else being present.

His body was found curled in the 
foetal position in the 140-litre black and red holdall with the keys to 
the Yale travel padlock beneath him.

Pathologists found no evidence of 
injuries or that he attempted to fight his way out. It remains possible 
that his dead body was put inside the bag.

Dr Wilcox said that whether Mr 
Williams was alive inside the bag and locked it himself 'was at the very
heart of this inquiry'. She may order officials to recreate how he 
could have got inside it at the full inquest which is due to take place 
next month.

Experts have been unable to agree on 
exactly how Mr Williams died, favouring asphyxiation or hypercapnia, a 
catastrophic build-up of carbon dioxide in the blood.

Their work was hampered by the heavily
decayed state of his body and his MI6 colleagues face questions over 
why they did not raise the alarm earlier.

Last images: Metropolitan Police released CCTV of his last known movements at Holland Park tube station

Questions: The family want to know why the alarm was not raised when Mr Williams failed to turn up to work and why it took his sister Ceri, pictured left at his funeral, to ring police to make them aware he was missing

It also emerged at the inquest that 
Scotland Yard detectives spent almost 20 months pursuing a DNA trace on 
his body that was left by a clumsy forensic scientist.

The chief executive of LGC Forensics 
will be hauled before the inquest to explain the astonishing blunder 
which was discovered only last month ago.

Red herring: It also emerged that a Mediterranean couple police wanted to speak to were irrelevant to Mr Williams's death

The inquest also heard that a 
Mediterranean couple who called at Mr Williams's block had nothing to do
with the case. Detectives released e-fits of the couple and have now 
traced them. They were looking for a friend's house.

The inquest heard that Mr Williams's 
family were unhappy about several aspects of the inquiry, including the 
role of counter-terrorism officers who dealt with MI6 and GCHQ staff. 
They have raised questions about who ordered a second post-mortem 
examination and what happened to Mr Williams's possessions held in a 
work locker.

The family also want to hear more 
details about the nature of his work but MI6 representatives said 
disclosing the information could endanger national security.

Dr Wilcox attacked police for delaying
the handover of evidence and questioned why the names of some witnesses
had been withheld. She said some sensitive letters had gone missing.

MI6 has applied for several of Mr Williams's colleagues to give evidence
anonymously and from behind screens.
