Tony Pulis has called for a rule change to allow for clubs to appeal yellow card decisions after Claudio Yacob was harshly sent off in West Bromwich Albion’s defeat to Aston Villa.

The Argentine midfielder was dismissed for a second bookable offence after making a small jump into a tackle with Leandro Bacuna but winning the ball cleanly.

Referee Anthony Taylor had already given Yacob a yellow for tugging back Gabriel Agbonlahor on the break. Yacob will now be suspended for one match, which Pulis called ‘disgraceful’.

Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood agreed the sending off was not warranted and Pulis slammed regulations barring an appeal.

‘The biggest disappointment about this decision is that it’s two yellow cards and we can’t then appeal and I find that disgraceful,’ he said.

‘It is absolutely shocking, you can get a red card and appeal but you can’t appeal on two yellow cards. I find it absolutely amazing.’

Asked if he would write to the Football Association, the West Brom head coach replied: ‘You’re joking.’
