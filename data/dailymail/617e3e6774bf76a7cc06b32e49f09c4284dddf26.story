Felicity Bassouls, 67,  is accused of harassing former England winger Ben Cohen after he split from her daughter Abby in September last year

England rugby and Strictly star Ben Cohen is to give evidence against his mother-in-law, who is accused of bombarding him with emails and calls after he split from his wife amid rumours of an affair.

Felicity Bassouls, 67, who lives in the Highlands of Scotland, is accused of harassing the former England winger after he split from her daughter Abby in September last year.

The World Cup winner, 36, was facing accusations that his marriage was ended by the 'curse' of the BBC1 show Strictly Come Dancing. 

He had starred on the 2013 programme with Kristina Rihanoff, but denied they had a relationship. 

On Facebook he wrote: 'It is a sad world when two adults cannot have a friendship.'  

Mrs Bassouls arrived at Northampton Magistrates' Court to answer a summons of two counts of harassment without violence.

One is against Cohen and one her own son, Austen Blaney, between 1 September and 29 October last year.

The former Northampton Saints player is the founder of The Ben Cohen StandUp Foundation, which aims to raise awareness of the long-term, damaging effects of bullying.

In a statement issued at the time of the split the couple said: 'Ben and Abby Cohen have agreed to take time apart to deal with some marital issues but remain fully committed to the welfare of their children.

'There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.' 

The couple have been married for 11 years and have twin daughters.

Cohen's on-screen chemistry with Kristina Rihanoff, sometimes known as ‘The Siberian siren', was widely noted in the 2013 show 

Mrs Bassouls of Alness, Highland, Scotland was told her case was adjourned for a trial due to begin at Corby magistrates on 12 August. 

Asked if she had any comment to make outside court, Bassouls said: 'I have nothing to say at this time.' 

Cohen met his wife in 1995, at the age of 17, and the couple married in 2003 before having their daughters in 2008.

Their split is the latest in a long list of post-Strictly break-ups.

Susanna Reid split from the father of her three children following her appearance on the hit show, and Rachel Riley - made her split from her husband known in November - when they called time on their relationship, post-dancing appearance.

Cohen's on-screen chemistry with Kristina Rihanoff, sometimes known as ‘The Siberian siren', was widely noted in the 2013 show.

She is extremely fond of the rugby star, calling him ‘the sweetest guy in the world’ soon after they met.

Rihanoff became romantically involved with Joe Calzaghe after the pair were partnered together in 2009.

The boxer dumped his model girlfriend for Rihanoff and the two entered a relationship, eventually splitting in 2013.
