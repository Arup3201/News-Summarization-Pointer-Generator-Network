Barack Obama is today facing accusations that his tale about a teacher told he was losing his job three times was not entirely accurate.

The President claimed on Thursday to have ‘had a chance to meet a young man named Robert Baroz’ - but they have reportedly never met.

He also talked about the teacher ‘receiving three pink slips because of budget cuts’ - but neglected to mention he reportedly never lost his job.

Speech: President Barack Obama is facing accusation that his tale about a teacher told he was losing his job three times was not entirely accurate

‘He’s got two decades of teaching experience,’ President Obama said in a press conference on Thursday. ‘He’s got a master’s degree.

'In the last few years, he’s received three pink slips because of budget cuts. Why wouldn’t we want to pass a bill that puts somebody like Robert back in the classroom teaching our kids?'

‘He’s got an outstanding track record of helping his students make huge gains in reading and writing. In the last few years, he’s received three pink slips because of budget cuts.

‘Why wouldn’t we want to pass a bill that puts somebody like Robert back in the classroom teaching our kids?’

The nearest they reportedly ever got to meeting was when Mr Baroz was on the front row of a jobs bill press conference at the White House last month.

Mr Baroz only actually met with White House aides and President Obama’s education chief after the event, reported the Boston Herald.

He has received ‘three pink slips’ - but his job always remained because of stimulus money or last year’s congressional jobs bill, reported the paper.

Mr Baroz is now working as a ‘literacy and data coach’ at a school in Jamaica Plain, near Boston, Massachusetts, reported the Boston Herald.

But he said he was happy for President Obama to use poetic licence to explain the importance of ‘investing in education and in communities’.

‘It was technically correct - yes, I 
did lose my position three times within four years in the Boston Public 
Schools,’ he told the Boston Herald.

Mr
Baroz added that President Obama posed a rhetorical question by talking
of people like him who are well-qualified but no working.

A White House spokeswoman said he told the story because Mr Baroz's school, 'like so many across the country, is facing a budget crunch’.

‘If Congress will pass the American Jobs Act, then we can put thousands of teachers like Mr Baroz back in the classroom,’ she told the Boston Herald.
