The Premier League TV tender sent out to broadcasters on Friday - which includes some Friday night games - is set to take the cost of a live PL fixture to the stratospheric height of £10million a match from the start of 2016-17.

The addition of 14 extra live games per season - stripped from the ‘protected’ Saturday 3pm kick-offs - will bring in another £140m, taking the monies from the Premier League’s domestic contract over three years close to £5billion.

The current deal values a PL match at £6.7m. Even with a 50 per cent increase compared to the 72 per cent rise at the last auction, the £10m-per-match figure is easily attainable - especially as arch rivals Sky and BT Sport will both break the bank for the rights to 168 games.

Premier League matches could soon be shown on a Friday night

- 168 matches will be available to be shown live from 2016 - 14 more than currently.

- Up to 10 of those matches will be shown live on Friday evenings.

- The 168 games will be split into seven packages - five of 28 matches and two packages of 14 matches. No single buyer will be allowed to acquire more than five packages or 126 matches.

- The ITT will include an auction for a free-to-air highlights package, held by the BBC's Match of the Day since 2004.

- The current total value of the domestic broadcast rights deals is £3.018billion over three years.

- An announcement on the 2016-19 rights is expected by early March.

- A later auction will take place for 212 'near-live' matches to be accessed on-demand, and for internet-based clips.

- The ITT will protect the Saturday 3pm 'closed period' where games kicking off then are not shown live.

Most of the 14 extra games - though fewer than 10 - will be played on Friday nights. And the matches will be offered for sale in a beefed-up 28-game package with Monday night football.

The four other 28-game sets are for Saturday and Sunday TV slots, while there are two 14-game packages consisting of midweek and Bank Holiday fixtures.

But even the smaller packages remain way beyond terrestrial TV’s reach. Sky, having seen BT grab their Champions League portfolio, need to win at least four of the five super packages to retain their dominant position.

ITV are sure to bid for the highlights contract, even though that format seems to have a much better fit on Match of the Day. As the BBC will prioritise retaining their MotD content, the Premier League can anticipate another huge rise on the current £180m deal.

Sky Sports have the rights to 116 games this season, and than number could go up with the new deal

BT Sport caused a shock with the previous deal when they paid almost £6.5m per game in 2013

Bruce Buck, chairman of the Premier League nominations panel, is understood to be the influential voice most in favour of promoting CEO Richard Scudamore to executive chairman. And Buck will have a good sixth sense as to when best to bring that recommendation to the 20 clubs.

England's David Gill is a virtual certainty to be elected by UEFA as the British vice-president of FIFA, having made a U-turn to stand following pressure from UEFA president Michel Platini. But he is still expected to face competition from Scotland and Wales.

Scotland FA president Campbell Ogilvie has yet to decide but is highly likely to put his name forward, while Trefor Lloyd Hughes, president of the Welsh FA, is already writing an election manifesto stressing his grass-roots football background. But certainly when Gill (above) takes his inevitable place on the FIFA executive, he will have to start dealing with the media, which currently he prefers to ignore.

Nick Davies, deputy general secretary of the crisis-hit IAAF, has bizarrely hit out at journalists for writing stories about his beleaguered organisation rather than sort out a mess that includes legal adviser Habib Cisse - apparently implicated by German TV in the cover-up of serial Russian doping - refusing to stand down as a consultant despite being told to do so. 

Davies, rather than return calls, chose to write a letter to little-known American website LetsRun.com in which he complained about the newspaper reports that a well-known British star was on a list of 150 athletes with suspiciously high blood count levels who were said not to have been target tested. But Davies wrote himself: ‘Athletes with a red flag reading may well be guilty of doping.’

Bassett spat with BT

Former Wimbledon manager Dave Bassett wanted to return his broadcast fee to BT Sport and asked for their interview with him to be taken out of the network’s Crazy Gang documentary.

Bassett has led protests about the BT programme, to be aired on Boxing Day, since being shown a preview last week.

He took Wimbledon through the divisions to the top flight, yet BT, who have focused on the 1988 Wimbledon FA Cup-winning side managed by Bobby Gould, believe that Bassett is upset at not being one of the central figures in the film. 

Station chiefs say the terms and conditions Bassett signed allow them to use all the footage he was involved in.

Bassett said: ‘I didn’t want anything to do with the documentary, having seen it. But I’m told I signed a disclaimer so I can do nothing about it. They certainly paid me in record time.’
