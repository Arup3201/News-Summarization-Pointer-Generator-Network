Leicester are close to agreeing a £7million move for Brighton forward Leonardo Ulloa.

Foxes boss Nigel Pearson is hugely interested in the Argentine centre-forward and the Premier League new-boys have been locked in talks about a switch for weeks.

And a breakthrough was understood to have been made yesterday, after agreeing a fee for the 27-year-old.

Ulloa arrived at Brighton in January 2013 and has scored 23 goals for the Seagulls since then.

But providing he agrees personal terms, which is understood to be a formality, Ulloa is set to leave the Amex Stadium this summer.
