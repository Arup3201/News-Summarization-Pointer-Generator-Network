The founder of a prominent Mormon women's group held a vigil in Salt Late City, Utah, Sunday night as her former church leaders met in Virginia to decide if she will be ousted from her church.

About 200 supporters turned out to get behind Kate Kelly, who decided not to attend the disciplinary hearing in her former congregation. Instead, she sent in a letter she wrote and about 1,000 letters from supporters.

The leader of Ordain Women is accused of 
apostasy, defined as repeated and public advocacy of positions that 
oppose church teachings.

The bishop of her former congregation 
emailed Kelly to tell her he and other leaders considered her status and
 reviewed her response, spokeswoman Laurie Turner said in a statement.

It says the bishop wants to weigh the decision, and he will notify her likely Monday.

Whatever the outcome, Kelly said she will always be Mormon.

'I don't feel like Mormonism is something that washes off,' she said. 'That identity is not something that they can take from me.'

She was shocked to find out earlier this month from her bishop that she is facing excommunication from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which she is a lifelong member.

Similar vigils were held in 17 countries, according to Ordain Women.

'I'm overwhelmed by the positive support, and I think it really demonstrates that this isn't just happening to one person,' Kelly said before the vigil started. 'This isn't just happening to me, but it feels like the entire Mormon feminist community is being put on trial.'

Kelly, an international human rights lawyer, said she stands behind everything she has done since forming Ordain Women in 2013.

The group advocates for gender equality in the faith, with the ultimate goal of allowing women in the lay clergy.

Kelly insists that she has not spoken out against church leaders or church doctrine.

Women can hold many leadership positions in church, but aren't allowed to be bishops of congregations or presidents of stakes.

Stakes are made up of up to a dozen congregations, known as wards. The church's highest leaders, called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, are also all men.

The church says only men serve in the lay clergy as prescribed in 'the pattern set by the Savior when it comes to priesthood ordination.'

Mormon officials aren't discussing Kelly's case specifically.

They say they are open to questions and sincere conversations about the faith, but that some members' actions 'contradict church doctrine and lead others astray.'

'In the Church, we want everyone to feel welcome, safe and valued, and of course, there is room to ask questions,' church spokeswoman Ally Isom said. 'But how we ask is just as important as what we ask. We should not try to dictate to God what is right for his Church.'

Kelly's group drew rebukes from church leaders in April when they marched on church property in downtown Salt Lake City's Temple Square.Â 

The women asked to be allowed in a 
meeting reserved for members of the priesthood, which includes most 
males in the church who are 12 and older.

Church leaders had previously told the group they wouldn't be let in and warned them not to disturb the faith's biannual general conference that weekend.

Kelly is one of two well-known Mormons facing excommunication.

John Dehlin, an outspoken advocate for gays and the creator of a website that provides a forum for church members questioning their faith, has a meeting with his stake president in Logan on June 29 to discuss his case.

Scholars who study the Mormon religion say Kelly and Dehlin are the most high-profile examples of excommunication proceedings since 1993.

That year, the church disciplined six Mormon writers who questioned church doctrine, ousting five and kicking out a sixth temporarily.

Jan Shipps, a retired religion professor from Indiana who is a non-Mormon expert on the church, said church leaders are practicing 'boundary maintenance,' using Kelly and Dehlin as examples to show people how far they can go in questioning church practices.

Melissa Mayhew, 31, traveled about 40 miles from Orem to attend Sunday's vigil and to support Kelly's right to advocate.

'We are all of us people who see things that we would love to improve about the church that we love deeply and dearly,' Mayhew said. 'And we want to be able to actually have these conversations, even with people with whom we disagree.'
