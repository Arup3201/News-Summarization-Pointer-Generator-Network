A 75-metre long flag is being flown from a pylon atop a hill overlooking Kobane, marking the liberation of the strategic strong-point from Islamic State militants in the Syrian city.

Pictures of the eye-catching yellow, red and green TEVDEM (Movement for a Democratic Society) flag on top of Mistenur Hill, which can be seen for miles around, have been circulating on social media.

Yesterday, it was revealed Kurdish forces now control about 70 per cent of Kobane after months of fierce fighting with ISIS.

Women's Protection Units fighter Arin Mirkan carried out a suicide attack on the hill in October, making the site particularly symbolic.

Commander Kendal told Firatnews.com that YPG and YPJ forces had defended the hill when ISIS attacked in October, and the sacrifice by Arin Mirkan symbolised the heroism displayed by the Kurdish fighters there. 

She said: 'When the gangs entered the city after taking Mistenur, we declared we would turn the city into a hell for them.

'We fought in every house, every street, shed our blood and lost our comrades. But we knew we would eventually retake Mistenur and our plans have born fruit.' 

The commander said the next stage was to rid the city of ISIS gangs,

'We were in no doubt that we would take Mistenur, and when we did we hung up the posters of our martyrs,' he said.

'By retaking the hill we have fulfilled the wishes of Arin and our other comrades who have fallen in the struggle.'

Commander Kendal told Firatnews.com that ISIS would no longer be able to move freely on the Aleppo road or on the road leading along the border to Tel Abyad. 

She said: 'We now have control over the whole city and villages to the east and south. 

'We will now crush the gangs in the eastern neighbourhoods where they have their backs to the wall. 

'In war, when you take the most strategic point it means the end is near for the enemy.'

The morale of the Kurdish fighters is said to be at an all-time high.  

'We promise we will deliver victory to all the heroic mothers of Kurdistan who have lost children, and will continue the struggle in which our comrades have fallen to the end. 

'Kobane and the resistance will triumph,' commander Kendal added.

Yesterday, it was announced the first group of about 100 U.S. troops will head to the Middle East in the next few days to establish training sites for Syrian opposition fighters battling Islamic State militants.

Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said the troops, mostly special operations forces, were authorised last week and would begin arriving in countries outside Syria in the coming days, with a subsequent wave of several hundred military trainers following in the weeks thereafter.

The U.S. focus in the campaign against Islamic State has been mainly on Iraq, with the exception of a large number of air strikes to support Kurdish fighters trying to prevent the takeover of the Syrian town of Kobane near the Turkish border.

Speaking yesterday, the press secretary said Kurdish forces now control about 70 per cent of Kobane, which was seen a few months ago as being near collapse, with much of it in the hands of Islamic State.

He said the advanced element of U.S. forces headed to establish training sites amounted to fewer than 100 troops.

'They're going to ... take a look at what's there and prepare for further deployments,' Kirby said.

Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have offered to host sites where U.S. forces could train members of the Syrian opposition to fight Islamic State and provide security in their home communities.  

Death: Deilar Kanj Khamis, known by the nom de guerre Arin Mirkan, blew herself up at an IS position east of the border town, killing ten jihadists

A female Kurdish fighter carried out a suicide bomb attack against advancing Islamic State militants, it has emerged.

Deilar Kanj Khamis, known by her military name Arin Mirkan, blew herself up at an IS position east of the border town of Kobane, killing ten jihadists.

It was the first known case of a female Kurdish fighter carrying out a suicide bomb attack against ISIS.

As Kurdish fighters withdrew from a position on the strategic hill of Mistenur, above the city, Khamis stayed behind.

In a desperate attempt to stop them advancing, she attacked IS fighters with gunfire and grenades and then eventually blew herself up, according to a defence official in Syria's Kurdish region.

She was among 15 fighters who 'martyred' themselves after facing jihadists, 'with all their strength', it was reported in a statement.

According to sources, she was a mother with two children, though this was unconfirmed.

While there is little else known about Mirkan, she was a member of the Women's Protection Unit, a branch of the People's Protection Units. The force has more than 10,000 female fighters who played a major role in the battles against IS.

In October, the force suggested all of their fighters would martyr themselves if it meant defeating IS and protecting the pivotal border town.
