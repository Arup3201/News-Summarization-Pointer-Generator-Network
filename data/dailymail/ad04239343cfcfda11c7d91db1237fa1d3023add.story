French Interior minister Manuel Valls says all Roma gypsies should return to Romania or Bulgaria because they cannot integrate

A French minister has called for Roma gipsies to ‘return to Romania or  Bulgaria’ because they   don’t integrate well in France.

There have also been demands from other politicians for the two impoverished countries to be ‘locked out’ of European agreements which allow freedom of movement.

Interior minister Manuel Valls’s explosive words yesterday started a wide-ranging debate about the abject failure of EU ‘open border’ immigration policies.

The European Commission immediately threatened sanctions against France for its policy towards the Roma community.

A spokesman insisted everyone from Bulgaria and Rumania was a citizen of the EU and therefore had a right to travel anywhere.

Three years ago the Commission’s vice president, Viviane Reding, sent a similar threat to former president Nicolas Sarkozy, saying that Roma expulsions had to stop.

The row will be of huge interest in the UK, as next year restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians looking for work are being swept away.

In an interview on the France Inter radio station, Mr Valls said: ‘The Roma should return to Romania or Bulgaria.’

The Socialist Party member added: ‘Yes, we must tell the truth to the French – these populations have a way of life that is extremely different to ours, and they are obviously in confrontation with local populations.’

Illegal Roma camps have sprung up on the edges of major cities such as Paris and Marseille. All have become associated with widespread crime and major health hazards.

Mr
 Valls, who was born in Barcelona, said: ‘It is unrealistic to think we 
will solve the problem of Roma populations only through integration.’

He said there is ‘no alternative but to dismantle these camps and gradually move them across the border’.

And
 last night he remained defiant in the face of criticism, insisting: 
‘The majority [of Roma] should be delivered back to the borders. We are 
not here to welcome these people.

‘I’d
 remind you of [former Socialist premier] Michel Rocard’s statement 
“it’s not France’s job to deal with the misery of the whole world”.’ One
 of Mr Valls’s own cabinet colleagues, Arnaud Montebourg, also pointed 
to the fact the minister’s family were migrants from Spain.

The issue in France will be of huge interest in the UK, as Britain prepares to welcome thousands of Romanians and Bulgarians looking for work in 2014

Mr
 Montebourg said: ‘A theory that such and such a person or such and such
 a people will never, ever be able to integrate just doesn’t stand up.

‘Decreeing in advance that it is impossible seems to me excessive and is worthy of being corrected.’

But Mr Valls said: ‘I’ve got nothing to correct. My remarks only shock those who don’t know the subject.’

Jean-Francois
 Cope, the leader of the opposition UMP party, meanwhile told France 
Info radio station that Roma criminals regularly  ‘harassed Parisians’.

Referring
 to the Schengen agreement which allows people to move across Europe 
without passport checks, Mr Cope said both Romania and Bulgaria should 
be excluded.

‘We close our 
eyes to the French government to what is happening in our country – the 
constant violence’, he said. ‘This is extremely serious and…it is out of
 the question that Bulgaria and Romania enter the Schengen area until 
the problem is resolved at the European level.’

There
 are an estimated 15,000 Roma gipsies in France. Two years ago the then 
interior minister, Claude Gueant, claimed the vast majority of street 
robberies in Paris were carried out by Romanian immigrants.
