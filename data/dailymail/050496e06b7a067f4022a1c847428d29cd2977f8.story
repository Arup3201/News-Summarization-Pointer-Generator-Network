Andrew Salmon, who has avoided a jail term after locking his wife in a shed

A postman who locked his wife in the shed after she insulted his late mother by singing “ding dong, the witch is dead” has been spared jail.

Grieving Andrew Salmon, 42, packed up his wife Beverley’s belongings and refused to let her into their home for allegedly mocking his mother’s passing.

When she tried to come in through the back door he bundled her into the garden shed and bolted it shut - just to “p*** her off”, a court heard.

The mother of-two, 42, managed to escape through a window and let herself into their home in Truro, Cornwall.

Magistrates in Truro heard how she raced upstairs and began throwing her husband’s clothes out of the window.

Salmon later told police he was depressed and unhappy his wife of 19 years had not been supportive enough after his mum’s passing last December.

The court heard he also suspected she was having an affair, calling her 'nothing but a common prostitute' during the explosive spat on February 6.

Salmon told magistrates he merely locked
 his wife in the shed to 'p*** her off' after she kept saying: 'Ding 
dong, the witch is dead.'

After she left the shed he responded 
by holding her down by her throat on their bed, punching her, ripping 
open her top and violently twisting her breasts.

Magistrates handed him a community order for 24 months and ordered him to take part in a building better relationships programme.

Salmon, who had no previous convictions, was also fined £100 and told to pay £145 in costs.

Salmon said he had suffered depression since the row on February 6 and has been told to attend a relationship course

Mrs Salmon, a receptionist, refused to comment on his conviction.

But Salmon continued to blame his wife for not showing enough respect over his mother’s death.

The couple, who have two children aged nine and 11, have since split and Salmon has moved out of their marital home.

He said: 'She never really got on with my mum or any of my relatives and when my mum died she was horrible and offered me no support - she was extremely unsympathetic.

'She would sing ‘ding dong the witch is dead’ from time to time and didn’t even come to her funeral. It was a really difficult time for me and my family.

'I decided to lock her in the shed as I knew it would really annoy her and that she would be able to get out.

'I shouldn’t have done it and I am sorry but I was provoked into doing it and she gave as good as she got. The things she was saying about my mum were horrible.'

He added after the hearing in Truro: 'She was kicking, biting and screaming. I’m sorry the argument ever happened but I never punched her.'
