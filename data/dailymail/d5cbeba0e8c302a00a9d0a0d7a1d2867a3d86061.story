He might not be earning millions of dollars in Hollywood just yet, but one former Premier League striker has made a successful transition from football to film. 

Nathan Blake, who is best known for his spells at Cardiff City and Bolton, has won an award from a Welsh film festival after turning his hand to acting.

The 42-year-old won the Best Supporting Actor gong at Film Fest Cymru 2014 for his role as a football coach in short film The Homing Bird.

Clubs: Chelsea (youth), Cardiff, Sheffield United, Bolton, Blackburn, Wolves, Leicester, Leeds (loan), Newport County

Total appearances: 532

Total goals: 167

International caps for Wales: 29

International goals: 4

After hanging up his boots back in 2006, Blake took on his first acting job in film Say It last year but missed out on the same award after being nominated for his debut performance.

Blake began his professional career with Welsh side Cardiff, scoring 35 goals in 131 league appearances before earning a move to Sheffield United.

He continued his form in front of goal at Bramall Lane, scoring 34 times in just 69 games before joining Bolton in a £1.2million deal.

Blake experienced highs and lows with the Trotters, getting relegated in 1996 before winning promotion back to the Premier League at the first time of asking.

Spells with Blackburn, Wolves, Leicester and a loan move to Leeds followed before he was released by the Foxes at the end of the 2004-05 campaign.

A Wales international who won 29 caps for his country, Blake was given a six-month suspension by the FA in August 2005 when he tested positive for recreational drugs.

A brief stint at non-league side Newport County followed his ban but his contract came to an end after just two months.

He follows the likes of Eric Cantona and Vinnie Jones into acting, with both ex-players having appeared in a number of films in recent years.
