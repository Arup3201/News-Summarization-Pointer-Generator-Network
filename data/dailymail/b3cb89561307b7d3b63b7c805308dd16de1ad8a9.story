A new chapter in the vicious Christie Brinkley-Peter Cook divorce saga has taken a new turn with the supermodel's claims that she's being bullied by him in a string of nasty emails.

The seemingly ageless blonde beauty divorced the architect in 2008, a sensational case that brought his $3,000 a month online porn addiction and trysts with a then-18-year-old to light.

Now, the former couple is locked in a bitter custody dispute over their children.

It was learned this weekend that Ms Brinkley, 58, wants Mr Cook to cough up $140,000 in fines over the emails, in addition to $32,000 in expenses for their two children, including school tuition and summer camp fees.

A source told the New York Daily News: 'Peter keeps trying to control Christie, and he can’t deal with the fact that he can’t control her'.

Mr Brinkley's lawyer Tom Campagna told the paper that a judge smacked Mr Cook with an order after their divorce that he be fined $5,000 for each time he got out of hand with Ms Brinkley.

She claims he has violated that order 28 times, but is not out for financial gain.

Mr Campagna told the Daily News: 'This is not about the money. This is about what we're calling bullying'.

Last week, Mr Cook lashed out at the supermodel in an explosive court document countering claims he owes her child support.

Mr Cook, 53, reignited their bitter custody dispute, claiming in a 91-page document at Suffolk County Supreme Court in New York that she owes him money - calling her a 'narcissistic egomaniac'.

The architect claims he is owed $25,000 from Ms Brinkley for caring for their children while she performed in Chicago on New York’s Broadway and London's West End, the New York Post reported.

He also claims Ms Brinkley is dragging their two children into their disputes, claiming she has called him 'truly narcissistic', and once wrote an email to their son that Mr Cook 'is jealous of my success'.

Ms Brinkley met Mr Cook in 1998 and had her third child, Sailor, with him.

Mr Cook legally adopted her son with ex-husband Richard Taubman, Jack.

She also has a daughter, Alexa Ray, with second husband, musician Billy Joel.

Ms Brinkley appeared in several of his music videos, including the 1983 hit Uptown Girl. They were married for nine years.

But Ms Brinkley, who has been married four times, has been trading jabs with Mr Cook since their acrimonious split in 2008.

Bitter divorce proceedings revealed Mr Cook spent thousands of dollars a month accessing internet porn.

He was also romantically involved with a neighbour’s daughter, Diana Bianchi, who was 18 at the time.

During their 2008 divorce, the court was told that he had paid Ms Bianchi $300,000 in the hope of her keeping the liaison quiet.

Ms Brinkley meanwhile charged that Mr Cook was a bad father who used 'overwhelming' physical force when disciplining the children.

The court psychiatrist said both parties needed therapy.

Blue-eyed and blonde-haired Ms Brinkley was born in Monroe, Michigan, but grew up in Malibu, California, before moving to Paris, France, for art school at age 18.

She then spent three years as an illustrator before being noticed by an American photographer - and then proceeded to appear on 200 magazine covers in the 1980s.

Ms Brinkley is most famous for appearing on three consecutive Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition covers from 1979 to 1981, and for her appearances in perfume and shampoo adverts.
