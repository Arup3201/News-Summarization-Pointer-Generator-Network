Kentucky Sen. Ran Paul went on the attack against former Secretary of State and potential 2016 rival Hillary Clinton on Friday night at a dinner in his home state.

Paul reportedly blasted Clinton for not doing more to prevent the assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, two years ago and made jokes at Clinton's expense about her personal wealth.

'I certainly wish that maybe she becomes preoccupied with something else because I don't think she's fit to lead the country,' Paul said of Clinton's presidential prospects, according to the National Journal.

Speaking about Benghazi later in his remarks, Paul again attempted to discredit Clinton, saying it was irresponsible of her not to read the messages that late Libyan ambassador Christopher Stevens sent the State Department in the days leading up to the terrorist attack.

Clinton has
 claimed numerous times that she couldn't have possibly read all of the 
cables sent to State every day nor would it have been a proper use of 
her time as the department head.

'If you don't read the cables from one of the most dangerous spots on earth, frankly, you preclude yourself from ever being our commander in chief,' Paul stated.

The Republican lawmaker also claimed that Clinton gave the Benghazi outpost the same level of deference 'as if it were Paris.'

'Benghazi's not Paris. Benghazi is a lot like Baghdad,' he reportedly said.

Perhaps the State Department could have 
afforded more security at the Libyan consulate if it hadn't spent $100,000 on an electrical charging station at the embassy in Vienna, Austria, or $700,000 on landscaping for the
 embassy in Brussels, Belgium.

'Rand Paul voted to shut down the 
government, wants the U.S. to retreat from our responsibilities around 
the world, opposes commonsense legislation like the Violence Against 
Women Act and equal pay legislation, and thinks employers ought to have 
the right to discriminate. With that record, he's got no credibility on 
the issue of who is fit to lead,' Democratic National Committee spokesman Michael Czin told the National Journal.

Paul joked that he had lost sleep over the financial woes of Clinton, who was spotted this weekend outside the Carlyle Hotel in New York City. 'I hope she can deal with only 100 million,' Paul said, referring to Clinton and her husband's estimated net worth

Paul also took shots at Clinton's comments that her family was 'dead broke' when Bill's presidency ended in 2001.

After asking the audience to observe 'a moment of silence' for Clinton, Paul joking said, 'Somebody must have been praying for her because she's now worth 100, 200 million.'

'I tell you it was really tough giving those speeches,' he said, referring to the large pot of money Clinton has made on the speaking circuit since resigning as Secretary of State in early 2013.

Clinton often charges $200,000 or more to appear before groups and has made an estimated $6 million off the arrangements. She and her husband have an approximate combined net worth of $100 million, as Paul mentioned.

'I hope she can deal with only 100 million,' Paul said, playing off his previous joke.

Mocking Clinton's admission in January that she hasn't driven a car since 1996, Paul said at least 'she had her limo driver with her for the last 17 years to commiserate.'

At the beginning of his remarks, Paul said in jest that he'd been losing sleep over Clinton's money problems.

Paul was full of jokes this weekend.

At an annual picnic in Fancy Farm, Kentucky, the following day Paul recited a poem about fellow Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell's opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes.

Grimes is running against the Republican leader in the general election that will take place in November.

'There once was a woman from Kentucky, who thought in politics she’d be lucky.

'So she flew to L.A. for a Hollywood bash. She came home in a flash with buckets of cash,' Paul said, per Politico.

'To liberals, she whispers: coal makes you sick. In Kentucky, she claims coal makes us tick.

'To the liberals, she sells her soul — the same ones who hate Kentucky coal.

'One thing we know is true, one thing we know is guaranteed, she’d cast her first vote for Harry Reid,' Paul said, name dropping current Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who will have to run for re-election as a party leader when the new Congress convenes next year.

'Grimes’ real pledge is to Obama; her first vote is to Reid; as for Kentucky, if that happens, it’s too bad indeed,' Paul concluded.

After an eventful weekend in Kentucky, Paul traveled to all-important presidential primary state Iowa, where he plans to attend events for the next several days.

Congress is recess until September, giving possible presidential contenders who serve at the federal level five uninterrupted weeks to test out their campaign apparatuses before officially announcing their candidacies next year.
