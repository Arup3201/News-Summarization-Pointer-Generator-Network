Consumers are turning away from scandal-ridden banks and opening 1,000 current accounts a day at Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society.

More than 365,000 current accounts were set up in the last 12 months – up 58 per cent on the previous year – Nationwide said yesterday, as customers deserted banks over poor service, high fees and mis-selling scandals.

To lure bank customers, Nationwide is paying 5 per cent interest on balances up to £2,500 in its FlexDirect current account – more than any ordinary savings account.

‘It’s a tonic to see banks at last being given a real run for their money,’ said Michael Ossei, of price comparison website Uswitch.

‘For too long they’ve been able to sit on their laurels and rely on customers’ deep-seated apathy and reluctance to switch. Now, with growing numbers of rival current account deals on offers, banks are going to have to sit up and raise their game.’

A recent survey by Which? consumer magazine found that more than a quarter of bank customers had had a problem with their current account – and a fifth who had made a complaint said that it had not been dealt with to their satisfaction.

A current account war is raging on the high street to try to break the banks’ stranglehold and new rivals are already emerging.

For the first time since the demise of Girobank in the 1980s, the Post Office is offering customers current accounts, in a trial expected to go nationwide next year, while Tesco and Virgin Money are poised to launch their own current account deals this year.

Last year, M&S launched a £20-a-month bank account designed to appeal to its regular shoppers, with money-off vouchers and discounts.

In September, new rules will be introduced which are designed to make it easier for people to move their account to another bank, a move backed by Chancellor George Osborne

Only three in every 100 bank customers a year bother to switch their accounts because many fear that the transfer will go wrong.

A recent Office of Fair Trading report found three-quarters of people had never switched banks, and that the vast majority had never even considered it.

In September, new rules will be introduced which are designed to make it easier for people to move their account to another bank.

It will only take seven days to switch over – instead of the current 18 days  – and money that is wrongly sent to the old account will be automatically swept into the new one.

This change is set to be backed by a multi-million pound advertising campaign, and is supported by Chancellor George Osborne.

Hilary McVitty, of the Building Societies Association, said: ‘Nationwide and others are taking on the banks at their own game.

'There has been a noticeable rise in the number of customers moving to building societies, with some reporting increases of nearly 60 per cent.’
