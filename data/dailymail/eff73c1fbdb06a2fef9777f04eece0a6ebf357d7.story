A Google software designer has stormed out of a conference in San Francisco after taking umbrage with the size of his audience.

Apparently angry that he only had a small group of people to see him, Google strategist Scott Jenson reportedly left 30 minutes before he was scheduled to speak.

Jenson was due to give the keynote talk at the Internet of Things Expo, to which he had invited himself, Readwrite reports.

Not happy: Google strategist Scott Jenson was not satisfied with the audience there to see him speak

The conference took place at the Marriott Hotel in San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf area

Witnesses told the Silicon Valley website that Jenson stormed out of the Marriott Hotel in San Francisco's Fishermen's Wharf area and told a woman at the registration desk: 'I am Google.'

Mr Jenson then followed this up with an apparent explanation of his decision to walk out, saying: 'I do not speak to small groups.'

According to conference spokeswoman Chelsea Montgomery only 'about 50' attended, ReadWrite reports.

It follows Jenson's self-invitation on Twitter when he wrote on April 28: '@IoTExpo2014 Is looks like you still have a speakers slot open on May 6th.... Hint... Hint.... (sic)'

Google has been contacted for comment.
