Taxi drivers have been warned that it is not appropriate to accept sexual favours instead of fares.

The bizarre warning was made after a driver had sex with a passenger in the back of his cab when she could not afford the fare.

Now dozens of firms in the north east have received a letter telling them not to engage in sexual liasions if they want to keep their job.

One of Hartlepool's major taxi firms told the Mail it was common practice for women to offer sexual favours instead of cash when they were short of change.

The taxi driver who sparked the move had his licence revoked after he was caught in an embarrassing position with a passenger.

He was discovered having sex with the woman in the back of his taxi last December outside the woman's home in Hartlepool, Cleveland.

She could not afford the fare so offered to have sex with him in exchange. He has since been banned from the roads by the town's licensing chiefs.

It is understood it is not uncommon in the town for women to offer sexual favours to drivers when they realise they have no change.

One worker at a taxi firm said: 'It does not surprise me at all, it is very common for girls to ask if they can perform a sex act when they are short of cash.'

Another driver at a different firm said: 'It's not uncommon for some of the lasses to offer the drivers things other than a fare when they make their way home from a night out.

'We have heard a few tales like this one. Normally this type of request gets laughed off by the drivers, but obviously temptation got the better of one of the lads.' All taxi firms in Hartlepool received the letter warning drivers they could be stripped of their badges if they were caught.

The letter was sent out after the Vehicle Owners Annual General Meeting, which took place on February 11.

It read: 'I would draw your attention to one particular issue which was discussed at the AGM - the issue of what would constitute unacceptable behaviour by a taxi driver.

'A driver had his licence revoked for having sex with a passenger in the back of his vehicle.

'I would ask you to ensure that any driver that works for you fully understands that any sexual contact with a passenger is unacceptable and is likely to result in the revocation of their licence.'

The letter finished with: 'Any offers of sexual favours must be politely refused.'

A spokesman for Hartlepool Council said: 'We can confirm that a taxi driver has had his licence revoked after admitting having sex in his vehicle.

'Hartlepool Council expects the highest possible standards from taxi drivers and they have a vital role in protecting the public whilst carrying out their work.

'We have written to all taxi drivers in the town to remind them that we will not tolerate such behaviour and any sexual contact with a passenger is likely to result in their licence being revoked.'
