Russia has joined the growing chorus of condemnation of the CIA torture programme, describing it as a shocking example of 'flagrant and systemic rights abuse'.

In attacking the methods the CIA used when interrogating prisoners following the September 11 attacks, Russia has joined a number of other traditional U.S. enemies to criticise it for what they say are human rights violations.

Russia's human rights commissioner, Konstantin Dolgov, said this week's U.S. Senate torture report revealed 'gross systemic rights violations' and jarred with U.S. aspirations to be regarded as a model of democracy.

The report found that the CIA misled the White House and public about its torture of detainees at secret prisons around the world after 9/11, and acted more brutally and pervasively than it had acknowledged.

'Despite the fact that this inquisitorial torture was used by CIA agents outside U.S. territory, this does not remove their responsibility for these deliberate actions,' Dolgov said.

'We urge the human rights community, the appropriate international organisations and institutions to pressure Washington to disclose the information on rights violations in full... and hold the guilty responsible.'

He pointed out that only an executive summary was released and urged international organizations and rights groups to push for the release of the full report and the prosecution of those involved in abuses. 

Moscow and Washington often spar about each other's human rights records, with Russia saying that the U.S. turns a blind eye to its own abuses while lecturing the rest of the world. The Ukraine crisis has brought relations between the two countries to their lowest point since the Cold War.

Russia joins countries like Iran, North Korea and China, all frequent targets of human rights criticism from Washington, to use this week's report as an opportunity to turn the tables on the U.S. 

Yesterday Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei labelled the U.S. as a 'symbol of tyranny against humanity', while China urged the country to 'correct its ways' and begin following international conventions.

China called on America to 'reflect on this, correct its ways and earnestly respect and follow the rules of related international conventions'. Above, a detainee is escorted to interrogation at Guantanamo Bay

In a sign of the damage inflicted by the revelations, even North Korea - whose own human rights record is appalling - described the methods as 'inhumane' and urged the UN Security Council to address the 'rampant human rights abuses' in the U.S.

However, criticism has not been limited to U.S. foes - today Turkey and Slovakia, both key NATO allies, also condemned the report.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, whose country is in a strategically critical location between Europe and the Mideast, told reporters in Ankara the report is being analyzed to determine whether any Turkish citizens were involved.

From what has already been read, however 'we see that there was inhumane and really unacceptable torture and treatment,' he said.

Cavusoglu praised the release of the report, saying 'transparency is important,' but, he added 'this doesn't legitimize the torture that was inflicted.'

'I hope our friend and ally, the United States, won't repeat these kinds of actions, that inhumane acts are not repeated,' he said.

Speaking alongside Cavusoglu, Slovakian Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak said the use of illegal camps and 'unacceptable methods of interrogation' detailed in the report had been known, but he welcomed the report's publication.

'I see it as a sign of the United States distancing themselves from these practices of the past,' he said. 'And it should also serve as a guarantee that things like that will never happen in the future.'

The Senate intelligence committee's 500-page report concluded that the CIA inflicted suffering on al-Qaida prisoners beyond its legal authority and that none of the agency's 'enhanced interrogations' provided critical, life-saving intelligence. 

Meanwhile, a number of former CIA officials have hit back at the report's findings, saying it was partisan, one-sided and biased.

Former vice president Dick Cheney branded it a 'terrible piece of work' and claimed President George W Bush was fully informed of the programme, and even authorised it.

Furthermore, the CIA never tortured anyone under the legal definition of the word, as asserted by Department of Justice lawyers at the time, he said.

The explosive report could yet open the floodgates for a wave of costly lawsuits for those countries complicit with the programme.

Experts who have spent years working at American detention centres said yesterday's report did not contain any surprises, but suggested that now detainees' torture allegations are supported by an official government report, claimants have far more evidence to back any legal action.
