Hours before the incident, the British backpacker took to Facebook to express her excitement about the trip.

'Up early doors to travel Frazer Island for three days,' she wrote shortly after 9am on Friday. 

Her page paints a picture of a young, fun-loving, outgoing, party girl who had been travelling around Australia, from a snow trip at Thredbo Resort in the Snowy Mountains of NSW to visiting popular tourist destinations including Cabe Byron Lighthouse, Surfers Paradise and Byron Bay.

She marked her three months in Australia in July, and believed to have spent most of her time living in Woolloomooloo, east of Sydney.
