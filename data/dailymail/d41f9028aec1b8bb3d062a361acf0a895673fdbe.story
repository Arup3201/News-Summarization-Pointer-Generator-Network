A 25-year-old teacher charged with second-degree rape of a male student was sentenced to a year in prison on Wednesday.

Kalyn Thompson had been teaching for less than a year when she turned herself into police last May over an inappropriate relationship with a 17-year-old victim.

Miss Thompson resigned from her position in the English Department at Kellyville High School in Oklahoma the previous month.

Kalyn Thompson, 25, had been teaching less than a year when she was charged with the rape of a teenage student in Oklahoma

She pleaded guilty to second-degree rape in Creek County District Court in Bristow on Tuesday. 

The former teacher was sentenced to one year the following day with a five-year suspended sentence. 

Thompson, who is not married and does not have children according to public records, will also have to register as a sex offender.

She will be allowed to serve her probation in Rockwell, Texas, where she provided an address to the court.  

According to NewsOK, the teacher had worked at the school for less than a year when she started texting a teenage student, a junior, in December 2013. 

The relationship quickly became sexual, according to police. 

The victim told police that they had sex twice -  once at a local lake and a second time in a Tulsa motel. Police found a receipt for the motel room in her name. 

The victim's mother found out and ordered the teacher to stop sending text messages her son but she continued.

The school found out about relationship after fellow students at the school spotted the teen and the teacher in her truck and took pictures. She resigned soon afterwards. 

The age of consent is 16 in Oklahoma, but Thompson abused her position of authority, according to police. 

The boy had been failing in English but quickly he jumped up to a 98 percent grade point average during the inappropriate relationship.
