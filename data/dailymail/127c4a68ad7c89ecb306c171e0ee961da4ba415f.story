The nephew of an Illinois mayor is suspected of shooting dead a grandmother, a young couple and the couple's two sons at their home in the tiny community of Manchester.

Manchester Mayor Ronald Drake revealed this afternoon that the suspected gunman in the horrific slaying was his nephew, 43-year-old Rick Smith. Smith was later killed in a shootout with police, authorities said.

The family of five were found lifeless in their Manchester home on Wednesday morning, and were later identified as Joanne Sinclair, 65, her granddaughter Brittney Luark, 22, the girl's boyfriend James Roy Ralston, and the couple's sons Nolan Ralston, 5, and Brantley Ralston, 1.

Shocking: Brittney Luark, 22, with sons Brantley and Nolan, was shot in Manchestor, Ill. home with her family

Tragic: One-year-old Brantley Ralston was shot dead on Wednesday. His parents, 5-year-old brother and great-grandmother were also killed

Another child, Cassidy Raston, 7, was in
serious condition, Sinclair's son-in-law Brad Teeter told the Chicago 
Tribune. State Police Lt. Col. Todd Kilby said the suspected gunman took
the girl out of the Manchester residence and handed her to a neighbor.

Police said the man entered the home 
through a back door.

They say two victims were found in one bedroom, two
in another bedroom and an adult male in a hallway.

It's unclear what the gunman's motive was. Police believe Smith and the victims were acquainted but they didn't provide details of the relationships.

The small village, that has a 
population of just 350, is in shock over the senseless tragedy.

A bystander called police and told them that Smith fled the home in a white sedan. A car chase ensued, leading authorities to the nearby town of Winchester. The
suspect was ultimately captured after a dramatic shootout with the 
police.

Officers shot Smith, and he later died at a hospital.

Police said they found a rifle, shotgun and large hunting knife in Smith's car.

Mayor Drake identified the gunman as his nephew just before 5 p.m today. He said he hadn't spoken to Smith in two years, but he believed his nephew was unemployed. Drake said the last time Smith contacted him was to borrow tools.

Scott County State's Attorney Michael Hill said Smith, of rural Morgan County, had previous convictions for reckless homicide, drugs and bad checks.

The family lived in a first-floor apartment of a housing development, according to state police spokeswoman Monique Bond.Â 

'The guy broke into the house,' Mr Teeter told the local paper.

'I
couldn't tell you about the guy, never met him, never seen him, never 
talked to him. Apparently broke into the home of my wife's mother and 
shot everybody inside.'

Deadly: Police officials investigate the scene at a house in Manchester, Ill., where the five victims were found dead

Tragic: A tragedy unfolded in the tiny Illinois town on Manchester, when five people were found shot dead early on Wednesday

'I'm at a loss right now,' he said.

The seven-year-old girl was taken to a Springfield, Illinois hospital with a gunshot wound. She is listed in stable condition.

Schools in
Manchester, which is located 50 miles west from Springfield, Ill. and 
about 90 miles north of St. Louis, Mo., were closed after officials from
the local sheriff warned school administrators that the suspect was 
still on the loose early Wednesday morning.

Les Stevens of the North Greene School District says he was told that the victims had been shot to death.

The district has since been informed that the suspect was captured.

The tiny community of Manchester registered a population of just 354, according to the 2000 census.

The village has a total area of 1.06 square miles.

'It's a tragedy,' Mayor Drake said earlier to the Tribune.

'I've lived here for 43 years and my wife's lived her for all of her life and there's never been a homicide.'

Manchester
resident Julie Hardwick, 48, said she lives in the same county housing 
authority complex as the victims. Authorities told her she couldn't 
return to her home yet because of the investigation, she said.

Senseless: Five-year-old Nolan Ralston was also killed in the tragedy

Family: Brittney's boyfriend James Roy Ralston, with Nolan Ralston, was killed in the shooting

Innocence: Relatives are in shock over the tragic shooting that left little Brantley Ralston, 1, dead. Four of his relatives were also killed

'The kids were really nice,' Hardwick said of the family. 'You couldn't ask for better kids.'

The Rev. Robin Lyons of Manchester United Methodist Church, one of two churches in the community said, 'this shows tragedy can happen anywhere.'

Two area school superintendents said they received calls from county sheriffs before 6 a.m. informing them that five people had been shot to death at a house in Manchester and that a suspect was at large.

Superintendent David Roberts of the Winchester School District and Les Stevens of the North Greene Unit District No. 3 both said they immediately canceled classes when they were told of the shootings and that other school districts did the same.

Roberts said the wounded girl is a student at Winchester Grade School and her teacher was with her at the Springfield hospital.

The school will use its own counselor, nurse and other staff members to help students who need to talk, Roberts said. Other area districts have offered to help too.

Roberts said he also will call on area ministers to be available on campus. 'I've found that to be helpful in the past,' he said.
