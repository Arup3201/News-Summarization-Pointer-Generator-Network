Geraint Davies, Labour MP, found that NHS doctors were inadvertently referring vulnerable patients

A bill calling for the regulation of mental health therapists will be introduced by Labour MP Geraint Davies this week after he found that NHS doctors were inadvertently referring vulnerable patients for quack 'gay conversion' treatment.

Although there are several existing professional bodies, such as the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, they are all private, independent organisations and membership is voluntary.

Mr Davies said: 'This year a million Britons will seek psychotherapy, but currently anyone can set themselves  up as a psychotherapist with no training or recourse for the patient if something goes wrong.

'If accepted, this Bill would mean psychotherapist and counsellor become protected titles, so to work as one you would have to meet the necessary standards of qualifications and experience.'

His Bill seeks to bring all those who claim to treat mental illness under the Health and Care Professionals Council.

The last Labour Government's plans to regulate mental health therapists were shelved by the Coalition.

The 
taste of food depends on the cutlery used, a new study suggests. 
Researchers from Oxford University asked 35 participants to sample the 
same yogurt with several different spoons of varying weights and colour.
 The study found that yogurt was rated 'more expensive' if eaten from a 
light plastic spoon instead of a heavier plastic one. Colour matters 
too. White yogurt eaten from a white spoon was rated sweeter than pink 
yogurt.

Cara Delevingne has turned to a fish oils in her battle with the disfiguring skin condition psoriasis.

She has been taking omega 3 herring caviar capsules from a range created by a family friend, Tom Oliver.

Trials into fish oils  as a treatment for psoriasis have produced mixed results, and doctors do not currently recommend it as a treatment.

Model Cara appeared at a Versace show in Milan with unsightly red patches on her legs and afterwards tweeted: 'Be gone psoriasis, you're no fun.'

Rugby star turned personal trainer Tom, who has his own supplement brand, Tom Oliver Nutrition, says: 'I got in touch with her sister Chloe, who is a friend of mine, and asked if we could help. She said Cara was still having problems with her skin and that she'd love to try our omega 3 supplement.'
