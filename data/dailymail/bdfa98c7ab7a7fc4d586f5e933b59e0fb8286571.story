A career criminal who gunned down a veteran police officer during a routine traffic stop has been captured following a shootout with cops - ending a massive manhunt that paralyzed St. Paul, Minnesota on Wednesday.

Mendota Heights Police officer Scott Patrick, a 47-year-old married father of two, was shot and killed after pulling over Brian George Fitch, 39, shortly after noon in the quiet Twin Cities suburb, according to authorities.

Witnesses told the St. Paul Pioneer-Press that Fitch opened fire without warning as Officer Patrick approached Fitch's car door. He fired several times, shooting the patrolman in the head. The officer's gun was still holstered and buckled.

Fitch then sped off in his green Pontiac Grand Am.

The shooting sent cops scrambling across the Twin Cities metro area in search for the gunman. As cops closed in on him, Fitch reportedly told a family member: 'Watch for fireworks, it's gonna be the the Fourth of July,' according to the newspaper.

Officers spotted Fitch in his car with an unidentified woman in St. Paul about 8pm. When a squad car cut off Fitch's escape route, he opened fire on police.Â 

Cops returned fire, wounding both Fitch and his passenger in a hail of bullets.

The woman is expected to survive her injuries, but Fitch's condition is not known.

Officer Patrick is the first cop killed in the line of duty in the history of the Mendota Heights Police Department. He was the most senior officer in the force, having joined in 1995.

He is survived by his wife and two teenage daughters. His boss, Mednota Heights Police Chief Mike Aschenbrener, said Officer Patrick was a 'family man.'

'He absolutely adored his children. He cared deeply for the city of Mendota Heights,' the chief told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

Dozens of mourners brought flowers, flags and teddy bears to an impromptu memorial set up on the side of the road.

Witnesses told the Pioneer-Press that after the shooting, two nurses who were in the area rushed to Officer Patrick's side and tried to revive him - to no avail.

Fitch has a laundry list of convictions, including felony theft, assault, making threats, possession of a firearm, and false imprisonment. Last year, he was convicted of burglary.
