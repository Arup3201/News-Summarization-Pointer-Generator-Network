Scratch-off lottery ticket players are flocking in droves to buy $30 tickets.

Both Georgia and Tennessee recently introduced higher priced tickets to target a different segment of people than those attracted by the traditional $1 and $2 tickets, and they have been a huge success.

Georgia introduced a $30 ticket last week, and Tennessee introduced a $25 ticket last April, both have sold very well.

‘People are buying them like crazy,’ a convenience store clerk told the Chattanooga Times Free-Press.

Georgia’s big ticket offers a $10million grand prize, Tennessee’s a $5million jackpot.

‘We've been very pleased with sales at this price point,’ a Tennessee lottery official told the paper. ‘It's not for everyone, but the payout and the opportunity for the larger prizes is the type of game some players prefer.’

A Georgia lottery official says the more expensive ticket came after market research showed demand.

‘Players have been asking for a higher price point ticket,’ Tandi Reddick told the paper. ‘Our neighboring states are having great success with tickets at high price points, including Florida and Tennessee, both of which offer $25 tickets.

‘Florida has also offered a $30 ticket. Many states are also offering higher price-point tickets, including Texas, New York, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Connecticut,’ she added.The top ticket in the country, though, is in Texas – at $50 a pop.

The pricier tickets tend to offer larger jackpots and better odds, making them attractive to the more discerning scratch off aficionado.

The odds of winning any prize, including another ticket, in Georgia’s ‘$10 Million Cash Spectacular’ are one in 2.77, the paper noted. The odds in a $1 ‘Fast Cash’ scratch-off are one in 4.64, and its top prize is only $10,000.
