Brazil legend Ronaldo believes it is merely a matter of time before Neymar is considered the world's best player.

The 38-year-old believes Neymar has given the Brazil team a much-needed boost, and that the Barcelona star is catching up to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

'It is very close. It's about time for Neymar to take his place as the best in the world,' the former Real Madrid striker told Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo.

'Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi are the best right now, but Neymar has come a long way. The move to Europe has done him good.'

And Ronaldo feels Brazil are craving someone like Neymar following a rough spell. 

'We do not have many great players,' he admits. 'We are living with hope in Neymar, who is excellent, the country's best, but at other times we had many others who we could rely on to play for the Brazilian team.'

Ronaldo believes those such as Ronaldinho, Kaka and Robinho failed to lead the team to its full potential, and that Neymar has to pick up the pieces. 

Brazil appointed Dunga as manager following their disappointing World Cup on home soil and have won six consecutive matches since. So, was that a good appointment? 

'Hard to say. I'm not there and I was not asked about the new management,' adds Ronaldo.

'The trauma of 7-1 (against Germany) very much hurt Brazilians. We can see that this fresh start after six games  is good, OK, but we are still being felt.

'We want to erase that memory. But I have a much better memory, which is 2002 against Germany itself (in the World Cup final). I'd rather stay with this memory.'
