He denies having an affair with another woman while his wife Elizabeth Vargas was in rehab for alcohol abuse.

But now Marc Cohn is admitting the married couple of 12 years are dealing with their fair share of difficulties.

In a statement to People, the Grammy-winning songwriter reveals 'long-standing issues' exist in his relationship with the 20/20 anchor.

'I will not comment on what is an extremely sensitive and private family matter – addiction and recovery are serious challenges and it's been a tough road for all of us,' Cohn told the magazine.

'I have been supportive of Elizabeth in the past – and will continue to be – regardless of the long-standing issues in our relationship.'

While he does not go into further detail regarding those issues, Marc is making reference to reports that he had an affair with another woman- the couple's mutual friend Ruth Zuckerman- after he was spotted having dinner with her shortly after Vargas returned to Manhattan from rehab.

Rumours: With the cheating allegations and his wife's stint in rehab, Cohn said 'it's been a tough road for all of us', pictured here in December 2012

A source close to the magazine said Cohn 'has a strong emotional investment in how the story is told because his primary concern are his kids and he doesn't want to look like a bad guy when he's not.'

The source further added, 'It's a complicated situation since what seems new in the public is a longstanding challenge for them over the years.'

Despite the cheating allegations, the Walking In Memphis songwriter has tried to remain tight-lipped.

'I have no comment regarding vicious rumors about a so-called “affair,”' he told MailOnline through a spokesperson.

Friend or foe: The affair was reported when a friend spotted Cohn having dinner with he and Elizabeths' mutual friend Ruth Zuckerman, one of the founders of Flywheel Sports spin studios

'I have encouraged and supported Elizabeth's recovery as her years of struggle have been hard on everyone. Out of deference to my family's privacy, I will not comment further.'

Sources have confirmed to MailOnline that Vargas and Cohn are still living together and have not separated, but his side suggested that it is because he wants to remain as 'a stabilizing force for both Elizabeth and the children'.

Adding to the love triangle is the fact that both Vargas and Cohn were friends with Zuckerman, the divorced head of Flywheel Sports, ahead of the alleged affair. They met her by taking spinning classes at her workout chain. 

Unidentified sources told MailOnline that in spite of the allegations, Cohn and Vargas are still living together and have not separated.

Opening up: Vargas spoke on The View in February about her recovery and how her husband was the one to alert her to a dependency problem

The source also said that they never separated and were still a couple both during and after Vargas' treatment in spite of the reports that a friend spotted Cohn having dinner with Zuckerman near the Flywheel outpost in Manhattan's Flatiron district at some point after her treatment ended.

Vargas left the treatment program in mid-November and then gave several interviews when she returned to work in January.

A different friend told The New York Post said that Cohn and Zuckerman had been more than friends for more than just one meal.

'It was disgusting that he was with Ruth while Elizabeth was in rehab,' the source told The Post.

Legal definitions: Friends of Cohn, known best for his hit 'Walking in Memphis', said that he has not moved out or ended his relationship with Vargas. Zuckerman, right, is divorced

Friends of the 'Walking in Memphis' singer denied that anything untoward happened in the first place and said that Cohn and Vargas had separated but MailOnline's sources denied that any a split had ever happened. 

Cohn, 54, and Vargas, 51, were introduced by Andre Agassi at the U.S. Open in 1999.

They dated for three years before getting married in 2002 and Vargas gave birth to their first son Zachary six months later. Their second son Sam was born in 2006.

During her post-treatment interviews, Vargas said that her husband was the one who encouraged her to get help for her alcohol dependency.

'Mark has been extremely supportive of Elizabeth over the years and its been a long haul,' a friend close to the family told MailOnline.
