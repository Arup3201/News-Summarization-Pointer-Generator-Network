The mother of a nine-year-old boy shot him five times in the home she shared with him and the boy's father in Steamboat Springs, Colorado then turned the gun on herself, according to a preliminary investigation by the Routt County Sheriff’s Office .

Lisa Marie Lesyshen shot and killed her son Asher on Tuesday, leaving a note by the child's bed telling the father Michael Kirlan that he was to blame for her actions.

Her husband was woken by the shots and called 911 as she asked him to kill her. She survived.

'Remember you are responsible for what has happened here and you are the person that caused it,' she wrote, signing the note, 'Lisa and Asher'.

Court documents filed on Friday say Lisa Marie Lesyshen entered her son's bedroom and shot the boy five times in the head, leg and chest. The documents suggest the child was asleep at the time of the shooting.

Michael Kirlan told police he ran to the room to see Lisa Marie Lesyshen leaving their son's room and walking into her bedroom, followed by two gunshots.

Kirlan called 911 in the early hours of Wednesday morning saying his son had been shot and that Lisa Marie Lesyshen had a gun and was telling him to kill her.

Deputies arriving at the Routt County home found Lesyshen wounded and her nine-year-old son dead.

Receipts found in the home show that Lisa Marie Lesyshen purchased the revolver used to murder her son two days before the killing. The employee who sold her the gun had to show her how to load it.

The employee told Steamboat Today that Lesyshen stated she wanted the gun for protection because her husband was out of town, and needed instruction on how to use it.
