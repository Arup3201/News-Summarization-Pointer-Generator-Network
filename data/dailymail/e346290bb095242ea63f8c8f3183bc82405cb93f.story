It seems that life really does begin at 40, if the latest string of celebrity romances is anything to go by.

Cameron Diaz, George Clooney and Jennifer Aniston are just a few of the A-listers who have found love after the landmark birthday.

Famed singleton Cameron, 42, who is known in the showbiz world as the eternal female bachelor, made waves  when she finally tied the knot with Good Charlotte rocker Benji Madden, 35, at their mansion in Beverly Hills.

Cameron has had her pick of men for the past two decades, dating everyone from Matt Dillon and Jared Leto to Justin Timberlake and baseball player Alex Rodriguez.  

The actress had always been adamant that she has no desire to settle down and marry, but after an eight-month whirlwind romance, the Annie actress tied the knot last week.

'We couldn't be happier to begin our new journey together surrounded by our closest family and friends,' the couple said in a statement to People magazine.

Only last year, Cameron told the May issue of InStyle magazine that women should never feel under pressure to get married, saying: 'A lot of people chase after it because they've been told, "This equals happiness". They chase it, they get it.'

A year earlier, she told a magazine: 'It [marriage] just wasn't the thing I was drawn to. I certainly didn't want it in my 20s. Or my 30s.

'I don't need to have the children in my life be a part of my literal flesh. And anyway, there's still a possibility of that, I ain't that old.'

Jennifer Aniston, the queen of the romcom that many feared might never find lasting love in real life, engaged Justin Theroux in 2012, when she was 43

And she's not the only star following this mantra. 

Her good friend Jennifer Aniston, the queen of the rom-com who many feared might never find lasting love in real life, became to engaged Justin Theroux in 2012 aged 43.

The actress starred in a steady stream of romantic comedy films since the end of the phenomenal TV hit Friends yet seemed unable to find lasting love after the end of her marriage to Brad Pitt.

But she has been dating Theroux, an actor and screenwriter, for the last few years, and recently declared: 'Yes, I'm very happy. I'm extremely lucky, and I'm extremely happy.'

Following her marriage split, Miss Aniston's high-profile romances made the headlines, most notably her time with womanising rock singer John Mayer, nine years her junior.

She previously had a long-term relationship with actor Vince Vaughn, her co-star in The Break Up, before their split in 2006.

She then dated British model Paul Sculfor for a few months in 2007, before moving on to her on-off romance with Mayer, 34.

Theroux, who has never been married, was first linked with Miss Aniston in May 2011.

Miss Aniston at the time confessed to being annoyed by the fact that she was seen to be unlucky in love, adding: 'It's very narrow-minded, I think. It doesn't measure the level or my happiness or success in my life and my achievements or any of that.'

Just before meeting Theroux, she said she did plan to become a mother, and admitted: 'I think people honestly just want to see me as a mom and married and barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen. And I just want to say, “Everybody, relax! It's going to happen”.' 

George Clooney, 53, also once known as one of Hollywood's most famous bachelors, shocked fans when he married Amal Alamuddin last summer.

Just a year before, he said he hadn't met the love of his life yet, but last summer, it seemed the search was well and truly over.

After a whirlwind romance with the British human rights lawyer, George walked down the aisle in front of friends and family in Venice.

George's love life before Amal was packed, with one of his first famous relationships being with actress Kelly Preston in 1987.

George then entered into his most serious romance (up until Amal) when he reunited with his ex-girlfriend, fellow actress Talia Balsam, who he had already dated for three years.

In 1989 the pair drove to Vegas in a Winnebago to tie the knot at a wedding officiated by an Elvis Presley impersonator, but after three years the couple divorced reportedly over  arguments about money.

Clooney admitted in a Vanity Fair interview: 'I probably – definitely – wasn't someone who should have been married at that point. I just don't feel like I gave Talia a fair shot.' 

He then went on to date Kimberly Russell, Vendela Kirsebom, Celine Balitran and Lisa Snowdon before finding love with Amal at the age of 53.

Simon Cowell has also seemingly found true love at 55, after welcoming a baby son with girlfriend Lauren Silverman last summer. 

And, although they've been in a relationship for well over a year - and welcomed their son Eric into the world in February - it appears the honeymoon phase is certainly not over.

The couple were pictured looking loved up during their month-long stay in Barbados this week.

Salma Hayek, meanwhile, is one of the most beautiful actresses of her generation - but she didn't settle down until the age of 42, when she tied the knot with French billionaire, Francois-Henri Pinault.

The glamorous star, now 48, recently opened up about ageing and dressing to impress her husband in an interview with InStyle.

The mother-of-one also said: 'When I turned 40, I started thinking, "This is the last year," whenever I’d wear a strapless dress,' she said. 

'I always thought you can’t wear them after a certain age, but I’m still getting away with it.

'I’m not really a fashionista,' she said. 'I have an eye. I can pull it together, but a lot of the effort I make is for my husband, because I want him to be attracted to me.'  

Elle DeGeneres also proves that you can find true love later in life. She met Ally McBeal actress Portia de Rossi in 2004 at the age of 44. The  wed in 2008 after the overturn of the same-sex marriage ban in California.

The talk show host denied divorce rumours to a March 2014 issue of People magazine, revealing: 'I love her so much it kills me. The truth is, and this is corny, I fall more in love with Portia all the time. I really do.

'She surprises me all the time. It's what anyone experiences when you find that person that gets you, wants to take care of you, wants the best for you. We're really lucky because we know how rare it is.'

Speaking about finding love later in life, celebrity life coach, Sloan Sheridan-Williams (sloansw.com), said: 'Finding love after 40 need not be daunting. The truth is the common factor in your relationships is you and therefore your life experience now puts you in a much better place to choose your perfect match resulting in long lasting love. 

'By the time you reach 40, unlike young love you have understood the concept that your happiness is not the responsibility of another person. 

'This results in better choices. By taking personal responsibility in life you can put in place the steps that will move you forward to attracting, not only the right partner, but one that complements you.

'Celebrities over 40 already have their career path planned, so their focus can now turn to relationships.

'There is a whole society of individuals that do not gain significance from relationships but from their career instead and as such attracting lasting love has not been their first priority. 

'Your brain provides you that which you focus on with intense emotion and as such if that focus is not pointed towards your love life then it takes a back seat.

'The good news is that science is actually on your side. As we get older it is suggested that gender differences often displayed earlier in life mellow. This is because brain biochemistry is rebalancing the sex hormones that affect our behaviour. 

'There is also research to suggest that passion increases with age, so a change of perception and a shift of focus towards bringing out your passionate side will allow you to nurture love once it comes along to an even stronger level than perhaps you would have had embarking on the same relationship earlier on in life. 

'The key to finding love is to take action towards meeting people, to learn lessons from past experiences and to use your knowledge to give the best to your partner and to yourself.'
