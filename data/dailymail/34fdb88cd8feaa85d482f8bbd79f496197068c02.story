Leo Santa Cruz, the vaunted US-based Mexican who defends his WBC world super-bantamweight title on the Floyd Mayweather-Marcos Maidana undercard in Las Vegas, is offering to fight Belfast’s new folk hero Carl Frampton next.

As he prepared to enter the Las Vegas ring against long-time friend and fellow Mexican Manuel Roman, Santa Cruz passed appreciative judgement on Frampton’s brilliant winning of the IBF title from Kiko Martinez last Saturday night.

Santa Cruz said: ‘I am really hoping for a unification fight against Frampton next. I was impressed by his win over Martinez and he is a very good boxer but I am confident I can beat him.’

Leo Santa Cruz, pictured here fighting Cristian Mjares in Las Vegas back in March, has been impressed by Belfast fighter Carl Frampton and hinted they could meet in his next contest

Santa Cruz was impressed by the manner in which Frampton beat Kiko Martinez in Belfast last weekend 

So confident that he adds: ‘Yes, I am willing to fight in Belfast even though Frampton has all that home support there.’

Santa Cruz then sees himself going on to England to relieve Scott Quigg of the WBA ‘regular’ belt he defends against Belgium’s Stephane Jamoye in Manchester this Saturday night.

All that would be by way of preparation for a duel for the undisputed super-bantam crown against Cuban maestro Guillermo Rigondeaux. 

The WBO champion’s brilliant defensive style has been criticised as unexciting in the US and Santa Cruz says: ‘We need to build a meeting between me and Rigondeaux into a super-fight because on his own he does not attract a big audience.’

Wins over Frampton and Quigg would help him in that enterprise but there may be a delay if the Belfast Jackal is forced first to make a mandatory IBF defence against America’s little-known Chris Avalos.

Meanwhile, Golden Boy promotions are willing to offer David Haye a comeback route to boxing if he wants to fight again.

Oscar De La Hoya’s matchmaker Eric Gomez, who is leading Golden Boy’s participation in Floyd Mayweather’s Saturday night with Marcos Maidana, noted Haye’s presence in Vegas and said: ‘We’ve worked with David before and we would be interested in doing so again. We would find him a place on an undercard.

‘He just have to start boxing again. He keeps fit.’

Golden Boy promotions are offering David Haye, seen here in his heavyweight fight with Wladimir Klitschko back in 2011, the chance of a return to the ring

Haye has not fought in the two years since beating Dereck Chisora at West Ham’s Upton Park football ground, since when he has twice pulled out injured from scheduled heavyweight fights with Tyson Fury.

London’s former cruiserweight and heavyweight world champion has just split from his long-time trainer Adam Booth and entered into talks with US boxing facilitator Al Haymon.
