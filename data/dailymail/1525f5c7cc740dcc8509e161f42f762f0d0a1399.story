The California camp ranger carjacked by ex-cop turned fugitive Christopher Dorner last month has filed a lawsuit seeking claim to the entire $1.2 million reward leading to his capture.

Rick Heltebrake, who was robbed at gunpoint by Dorner while driving on a Big Bear-area road last month, has filed his suit against the city of Los Angeles claiming that it was his 911 phone call that led to Dorner's cornering.

The full-time Boy Scouts ranger's life was spared during that carjacking while allowed to safely exit his truck and later call 911.

According to his claim, it was that call that ultimately led to police cornering Dorner three days later in a nearby cabin.

'Mr Heltebrake immediately recognized this man as Christopher Dorner,' his attorney Allen L Thomas wrote in the claim filed on February 19 and obtained by the Los Angeles Times.

'Mr. Heltebrake's telephone call to Deputy [Paul] Franklin notified law enforcement of Mr. Dorner's location, provided a description of the vehicle he was fleeing in and was the substantial factor in the capture of Mr. Dorner at the cabin location,' his attorney wrote.

'Consequently, Mr. Heltebrake accepts the mayor's offer of the entire reward of $1.2 million,' he adds.

A couple kidnapped by Dorner in their
rental apartment but who later managed to escape and call 911 reporting
him to authorities just before Mr Heltebrake are said by some to be 
also entitled to the reward.

That's a claim Mr Heltebrake previously acknowledged while saying he'd be fine splitting it three ways.

Hero call? Mr Heltebrake says that after he was carjacked by Dorner with his dog, seen, his 911 call ultimately led to Dorner's cornering inside a nearby cabin

Remains: The burnt out cabin near Angelus Oaks, California is seen one day after the fugitive ex-cop killed himself inside before taking his fourth victim of a responding officer

Still, he said at the time to a reporter: 'Someone owes me $1 million.'

The reward money is believed to be the largest ever offered locally thanks to the outpouring of more than two-dozen donations to catch the man who was ultimately accused of taking the lives for four people including two police officers.

Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck has said that the recipient of the reward money will be decided according to the completion of their investigation.

Arguments over word technicalities used in advertising the reward have recently suggested that no one will get the money at all, with Dorner having not been captured and convicted.

‘Our personal hope is that the reward will be distributed, but we must follow the rules and respect the procedures of each entity,’ officials said.
