A shop assistant who spent 30 minutes fending off a knife wielding woman trying to attack him has been branded a hero after refused to strike back at her - because he was raised to never 'hit a woman.'

Michael Whybrow, 59, was cornered in his petrol station kiosk as drunk Anna Chambers, 29, lunged at him with an eight-inch blade.

The cashier bravely grabbed hold of the knife slicing open his hands in a bid to protect both himself and his attacker.

Courageous: Michael Whybrow who foiled an armed attack on his petrol station without harming the drunken would-be thiefÂ 

Chambers leans menacingly over the counter brandishing her eight inch blade at the terrified shop assistant

Pathetic: Knife wielding Anna Chambers was drunk at the time of the attack and has now been jailed for six years, her defense said she didn't even need the money in the till

But when the weapon was cast to the side vicious Chambers smashed the top off a glass bottle and continued her onslaught.

CCTV shows violent Chambers repeatedly leave the garage after being pushed away by Michael, before returning to attack him again.

The cashier managed to dial 999 and left the phone off the hook in the hope the call handler would trace it.

But while he waited for police to arrive he was forced to repeatedly defend himself against Chambers for half-an-hour, intentionally not harming her - despite her constant violence towards him.

Chambers, who apparently became enraged by the death of her puppy, was arrested and has now been jailed for six years.

Following the conviction grandfather-of-nine Mr Whybrow said he did not believe in hitting women.

He said: 'She tried to jab me with the knife. I pressed the panic button under the desk and the button to lock both doors.

'I also called 999 on the phone and left it off the hook - hoping that the police would hear what was going on.

'Some people asked why didn't I just hit her but I was bought up not to hit a woman.

Chambers was jailed at Canterbury Crown Court yesterday after admitting attempted robbery of the Murco petrol station, in Ashford, Kent, in February, and possession of a knife.

Judge James O'Mahony, sentencing, said: 'I want to say just how brave he [Mr Whybrow} was and he acted in the most sensible way.

With a scarf wrapped over her face Chambers launches her attack but Mr Whybrow calmly presses the panic button and refuses to hand over the contents of his till

'He showed the other side of humanity and I strongly hope he will be treated with every consideration by his employers.'

The court heard how Chambers had entered the petrol station with a scarf wrapped around her face at 4.50am on February 21.

She approached the till and dived towards a stunned Mr Whybrow in a bid to empty the contents of his till.

The father-of-three immediately pushed the panic button but had to defend himself as she repeatedly tried to stab him and get hold of the money while he waited for emergerncy services.

Drama: Mr Whybrow valiently wrestles the knife away from Chambers slashing his own hands but temporarily preventing her from doing any more damage

Confused: Once drunken Chambers realises her victim is bleeding she is overcome with remorse and bizarrely rushes to hand him paper towels

Caught: After 30 terrifying minutes police arrive at the petrol station and quickly apprehend Chambers in the shop, she was jailed for six years yesterday

Mr Whybrow desperately tried to reason with the thug - pointing out that she was being filmed on CCTV - before grabbing her knife with his hands.

The court heard confused Chambers eventually dropped her weapons when she saw Mr Whybrow's blood and tried to help him by rushing to get some kitchen towel before police arrived and quickly detained her.

David Griffiths, defending, told the court that Chambers had been driven to the robbery after the death of her puppy.

He said: 'How she came to leave her house that night with a knife. I don't think even she is sure.

'The reality was that she was drunk. She didn't really need the money.'
