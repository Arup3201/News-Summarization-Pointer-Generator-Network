Kyle Richards, 45, reveals she has suffered dry eye syndrome for five years

Fans of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills will know it’s an emotional show.

Viewers have seen tears of anger, sadness and joy across the last four seasons.

But for one cast member, tears weren’t a problem - but a lack of them.

Kyle Richards has revealed she has been suffering with chronic dry eye syndrome for the past five years, which made her constantly uncomfortable and made filming difficult.

Five years ago she began noticing her eyes were painful and she needed to use eye drops that helped her eyes stay temporarily moist.

Her condition became so bad she had to use eye drops every five minutes.  

She told MailOnline: ‘I first started noticing about five years ago. It was so uncomfortable I couldn’t see. 

'My eyes would be blurry unless I blinked. They bothered me all the time’ she said,

‘I was using false tears [eye drops] every five minutes. 

'I kept thinking I was dehydrated, I put water in my eyes - but that made it worse. It was just so uncomfortable.'

She says not knowing what was wrong made the situation even more infuriating. 

'I would say to my girlfriends "Do you have this?"

‘When I was shooting I’d have to use false tears all the time then my mascara would run’. It made me irritable.’

Eight months ago she went to the doctor who diagnosed her with dry eye syndrome, or dry eye disease.

This is a common condition that occurs when the eyes dry out and become inflamed, red and swollen.

It happens when the eyes don't make enough tears or the tears evaporate too quickly.

Kyle lives in LA, which is hot and windy, and wears contact lenses – two known causes of the condition.

It can also be caused by other eye diseases or underlying conditions, side effects to certain medications and by hormonal changes, such as during the menopause.

Kyle said before was diagnosed, she wasn’t aware the condition existed - and then became concerned it was a sign of ageing. 

‘I thought "Am I too young to be getting this? Does it mean I’m getting older?" 

Before she was diagnosed, Ms Richards had no idea the condition existed, and kept asking her girlfriends 'Do you have this?'

'But I’ve learned from my doctor that it affects people of all ages. People don’t realise it’s a diagnosed condition.' 

As the fifth series of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills is about to come out, news reports reveal the 45-year-old is in great shape - despite having four children.

She says she maintains her enviably trim physique through a no-sugar diet.

‘It’s about a healthy lifestyle,' she told MailOnline.

'I avoid sugar, carbs, dairy. I’m always trying to be a healthy as I can be. I’m constantly learning more about nutrition.’

And when she commits to a diet she sticks to it, she added.

‘There are times in my life when I fell off and then you don’t see any results. It makes such a difference by sticking to it. 

There has been a lot of crying in the past four seasons of the show, but Ms Richards says the fifth season about to air is 'the best season ever'

'My husband and my kids notice. It used to be about looking good, but now it’s about feeling healthy and living a long time.

‘It used to be about looking cute in that dress, now it’s about being here a long time.

‘You start realising you’re fragile.’

She is equally disciplined when it comes to exercise, never skipping a workout she has planned in favour of watching some reality TV.

‘Spinning, circuit training and hiking and I take off one day a week. I tell myself it’s not an option. I just make myself. It’s easy to slack off. I keep going. I never cancel a workout.’

When asked whether surgery is something she would recommend for her own daughters, she said although she did not regret going under the knife, it’s not something she’d recommend for her own children.

Dry eye syndrome, or dry eye disease, is a common condition that occurs when the eyes do not make enough tears or the tears evaporate too quickly.

This leads to the eyes drying out and becoming inflamed (red and swollen) and irritated.

Dry eye syndrome is also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or simply 'dry eyes'.

The symptoms of dry eye syndrome usually affect both eyes and often include:

-feelings of dryness, grittiness or soreness that get worse throughout the day

-red eyes

-eyelids that stick together when you wake up

-temporarily blurred vision, which usually improves when you blink

‘I’m not pro-surgery but I’m honest and open about what I’ve done. 

'If my daughters wanted it I would be against it. I would be dead against it. To me, they are perfect.’

Speaking of the new season of the show, she said rumours that she gets into a fight with fellow housewife Brandi Glanville at a cast party are ‘inaccurate’.

She is diplomatic, avoiding questions about allegations the two new members of the show, Lisa Rinna and Eileen Davidson, are already   creating drama.

‘It’s a very intense season,' she said.

'It’s going to be the best season ever. I’m not allowed to say a lot about, but it’s been very interesting to say the least.'

But despite her new fitness regime, she has openly admitted that she has had both a nose job and liposuction in the past, in order to improve her self-esteem. 

Kyle was prescribed Restasis, a prescription drug which helps the body produce more tears.

‘After using it daily for six months, I noticed I was making more of my own tears.'

‘You take twice a day, once in the night once in the morning. I make it part of my routine.’

'Now my eyes are comfortable, I might have to use artificial tears in air conditioned room, but apart from that I can throw them away.’

A diet that includes omega-3 fats can help with dry eyes. Kyle said she included these in her diet, but the pills didn’t make much of a difference.

‘I took vitamins before anyway but it didn’t work’ she added.

Serious cases of the condition can be treated with surgery to prevent tears from draining away easily, but Kyle said this was not an option for her.
