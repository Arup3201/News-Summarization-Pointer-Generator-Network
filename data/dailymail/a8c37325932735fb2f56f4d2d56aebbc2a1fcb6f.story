If you spot something unusual in the sky over Wiltshire today, don’t be alarmed.

It’s not a UFO but the Army’s newest unmanned aircraft, sent up to capture images of the countryside below.

The ‘spy in the sky’ can fly for longer than drones currently used in Afghanistan and  provide clearer pictures to troops on the ground. It will be tested over Wiltshire from today, before being deployed in the summer.

Design: It is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for all weather and its primary uses are intelligence gathering, surveillance and target acquisition

The Watchkeeper – which has a 33ft wingspan – can fly for 16 hours, sending real-time images to pilots on the ground, who control it from up to 100miles away. It also boasts better cameras than previous models.

It is expected after MoD trails finish the pilotless surveillance aircraft - which boasts better cameras and sensors than previous models - will be deployed this Summer.

Colonel Mark Thornhill, commander of the 1st Artillery Brigade, said: ‘It is a highly capable and very robust system that will be used to provide intelligence and surveillance for the ground forces from 16,000ft.’

The primary roles will be to provide intelligence, surveillance and target acquisition capabilities in direct support of the ground command.

'Compared to other unmanned air system (UAS) it can fly for longer, it can flu off rough strips, it has better sensors and all together a much better capability.

'It allows us to provide real-time imagery down to the ground commander so that he can then take appropriate action depending upon what he sees and what he learns from that imagery.

'Therefore, he will be able to perform in a much better fashion and make much better operational decisions based on the imagery we are providing to him.'

When asked of plans to send the drones to Afghanistan, he said: 'At the moment that is an operational decision.'

Pilots will go through six months of training at Larkhill in Wiltshire. Despite fears over the safety of unmanned drones, Colonel Thornhill insisted: ‘It is very safe. They are certified in exactly the same way that a manned aircraft has been certified.’
