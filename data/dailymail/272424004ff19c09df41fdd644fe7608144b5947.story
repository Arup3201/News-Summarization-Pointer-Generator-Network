Prince William is due to take two weeks’ paid paternity leave following the birth of his first child before returning to work as an RAF pilot.

The Duke has made it clear that he is not expecting special treatment from military bosses despite the birth of his first child being in the public spotlight.

He will take a fortnight of statutory paternity leave and will be paid £136.78 a week.

It is understood that the Duke will then return to work at RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales, where he will resume his normal shift pattern.

Despite his sense of duty, the journey could prove a lonely one for the Duke, as his wife and child will not be making the journey to Wales. 

Only last month, it was feared that William might miss the birth due to remaining on standby as a pilot while his wife went into labour.

But he has been on annual leave for the last week, allowing him to fulfil his ambition of being with Kate in the delivery suite ‘by hook or by crook’.

The move follows in the footsteps of his father Prince Charles who also broke royal tradition to be with his wife Princess Diana for the birth of both their children.

The Duke is the first member of the Royal Family to take advantage of statutory paternity leave, which was introduced in the UK in 2003.

Under the rules, fathers are entitled to two weeks paid paternity leave and up to 26 weeks’ additional paid leave if the child’s mother returns to work.
