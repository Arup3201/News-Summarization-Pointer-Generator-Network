Battered: The suspected thief was left with a black eye and bruises

A posse of male strippers tackled a 
gunman to the ground on Tuesday after catching him rifling through their
 costumes backstage at a Las Vegas show.

The
 suspected thief, who fired a shot during the scuffle, was left with a 
black eye and bruises after his confrontation with Thunder From Down
 Under.

Six of the Australian strip troupe were able to wrestle him to the ground and keep hold of him till police arrived.

The suspected thief is accused of trying to escape with a suitcase full of costumes and props used by the strippers.

As they jostled him to the floor of their dressing room in the Excalibur Hotel and Casino, his handgun went off, police said.

The
 bullet struck a wall, the gun fell to the floor, and six well-muscled 
members of the Australia-based group held the man until security 
arrived, according to the police report.

The suspect, who appears to be in his 20s, identified himself, but police suspect he provided a fake name.

He suffered unspecified injuries and was hospitalized before being booked as 'John Doe' in the Clark County jail.

A jailhouse booking photo shows a black eye and facial bruises from the backstage scuffle.

'The suspect definitely got the worst of it,' Las Vegas police Officer Laura Meltzer said.

The
 suspect was awaiting an initial court appearance on felony attempted 
murder, armed robbery and burglary with a weapon charges that could get 
him decades in state prison if he is convicted.

Backstage: The strippers found the suspected thief in their dressing room

One cast member was treated at the Excalibur for minor injuries. The weapon, which was not registered, was seized as evidence. It is not known if the suspect has a lawyer.

Several
 people told investigators they noticed the man walking around the 
showroom before Tuesday's performance wearing a SWAT hat, fireman's 
shirt and police-style boots.

They told investigators that no one approached him because they thought he was a new dancer.

When confronted, the man allegedly told the show director that he bought the items for his girlfriend.

Performers later realized the items he wore had been taken from their dressing areas, according to the police report.

His motive is unclear but he appeared to be under the influence of methamphetamine, police told the Review Journal.
