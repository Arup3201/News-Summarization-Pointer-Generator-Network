A group of Scottish football legends have come out in support of the Union, but then received a barrage of abuse on Twitter.

David Moyes, Alan Hansen and Ally McCoist were among 16 former players and managers calling on fans to reject independence when the vote takes place on September 16.

But many Twitter users were quick to make their voices heard, and attacked the group.  

One Twitter commentator described Murdo MacLeod as a Tory c*** due to his rejection of independence

The team, which includes 16 players from the 1960s to the 2000s and former Old Firm managers Billy McNeill and Walter Smith issued a joint statement through the Better Together organisation. 

They said: 'We are proud Scots who have been proud to represent our country around the world. When Scotland calls, we answer.

'We are proud that Scotland has always stood on its own two feet but we also believe that Scotland stands taller because we are part of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is a country Scotland helped to build.

'We urge every patriotic Scot to help maintain Scotland’s place in the United Kingdom which has served Scotland so well.' 

The intervention of the high profile footballers has not been welcomed by people promoting a Yes vote.

Some, such as Alan Hansen and Paddy Crerand  have been criticised for joining the debate as they no longer live in Scotland. Hansen left for Liverpool in 1977 while Crerand arrived in Manchester in 1963.

Other footballers such as Ally McCoist faced abuse over the fact that previous comments may have been seen as being in favour of independence. 

Murdo MacLeod was accused of wanting to strip and privatise the National Health Service which saved his life. Other Twitter users described him as a Tory. 

Other pro-independence supporters questioned Hansen's qualifications for commenting on economic matters

Paddy Crerand's relevance to the debate was raised over the length of time he has lived in England 

Pro-independence activists criticised some of the players over the fact that they no longer live in Scotland 

Scottish Labour's deputy leader Anas Sarwar praised the intervention of the footballers. 

Speaking to the Daily Record, he said: 'These men have played for the national team, have led Scotland and are now saying what they believe is best for Scotland.This shows that there is no shortage of passion and patriotism from those that are voting No.

'This isn’t a choice about whether Scotland is a nation or not as, these legends show, Scotland already is a proud nation.

'This is a choice of what vision we think is best for our future in Scotland and we believe that is solidarity, unity and teamwork.'

Rangers: David Moyes and  Ally McCoist have also lent their support to the No campaign

Speaking at an event to launch the statement in Glasgow, football commentator and Better Together supporter Archie Macpherson called on the No side to inject more heart into its arguments during the final days of campaigning.

He said: 'It has been a logical and rational presentation of facts on the currency, North Sea oil, pensions and so on, which are absolutely vital, but it has got to be backed up with conviction and passion.

'So it is not just reasoned arguments - you have got to reach out and communicate with people.'

Mr Macpherson, who recently spoke out for the union at a rally in Dundee, added: 'All these figures played with passion - people on the terracing responded with passion, passion was at the core of football in Scotland, and it was only passion that kept us going against bigotry.

'And they are backing the last home stretch passionately and the people on the terracing will recognise that, and I am sure they will go with them.'  

The full line-up includes Alex McLeish, Jim Leighton, David Moyes, Alan Hansen, Willie Miller, Paddy Crerand, Davie Provan, Barry Ferguson, Bertie Auld, Denis Law, Ally McCoist, Derek Johnstone, Murdo MacLeod, Ian Durrant, John Brown and Frank McAvennie.

However, following today's announcement, members of the pro independence movement have taken to social media to criticise Hansen's intervention in the debate. 

One Twitter account for the Yes Scotland campaign even published an aerial photograph of Hansen's Merseyside house.

Michael Stewart, a former Scottish international footballer, pundit and Yes Scotland campaigner, said: "It's always interesting to hear different views on this big issue, and I am hearing many, many other voices within the football world who are backing Yes.

'The real strength of the Yes campaign is seen in the many fans' groups who are backing independence right across the country.

'And this is just symbolic of the groups and movements from all walks of life in the powerful, ever-growing grassroots movement who, I believe, will help deliver the all-important Yes vote in just over a week's time.'

In recent weeks, celebrities such as JK Rowling, Sir Alex Ferguson and Susan Boyle have all previously come out in support of a no vote. David Bowie used his acceptance speech at the Brit Awards to urge 'Scotland stay with us'. 

However, comedian Frankie Boyle and James Bond star Sir Sean Connery have both said Scotland would benefit by independence. 

With polling day approaching on September 18, the gap held by the No campaign has fallen to just six points with 53 percent of the population planning to reject independence - down from 73 per cent in May.
