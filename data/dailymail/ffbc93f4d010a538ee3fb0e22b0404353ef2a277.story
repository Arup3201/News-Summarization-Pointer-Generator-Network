Schalke right-back Atsuto Uchida is emerging as a target to be Bacary Sagna's replacement at Arsenal.

The Japan international, 26, was watched extensively by the Gunners last season and features on the club's list of potential summer buys.

Sagna will join Manchester City on July 1 after agreeing a three-year deal worth up to Â£150,000-per-week.

Old and new? Bacary Sagna, left, will leave Arsenal to join Manchester City on July 1 and Toulouse defender Serge Aurier could be his replacement

Southampton's Callum Chambers, Toulouse's Serge Aurier and Manchester City's Micah Richards are also in contention to replace Sagna.

In addition to a new right-back, manager Arsene Wenger also wants a defensive midfielder and at least one new striker.

The club are not ruling out a move for former skipper Cesc Fabregas, but view a new centre-forward and a holding midfielder as their transfer priorities.
