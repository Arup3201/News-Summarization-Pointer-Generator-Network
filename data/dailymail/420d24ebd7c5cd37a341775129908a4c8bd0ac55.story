Luxury holiday chalets worth millions of pounds could fall into the sea following a series of huge landslides triggered by heavy rain.

Some 18 wooden chalets - which cost up to £200,000 each - have been damaged or have slumped towards the cliff edge at Monmouth Beach near Lyme Regis, Dorset, after 500 tons of mud and earth pushed the buildings forward during the landslides.

The steady deluge has built up behind the cabins which are now precariously perched on the sloping cliff, with one even tilted up at a 30 degree angle.

Disaster: The chalets at Monmouth Beach in Dorset are falling into the sea after huge landslides triggered by heavy rain

The landslide has rendered the stretch of Britain’s Jurassic Coast so unsafe it has been closed off to the public.

Lyme Regis Town Council, which owns the land, has also announced it will not renew the licences for 11 of the chalets and are asking owners to remove them as the area is no longer safe.

The buildings themselves are said to be worth up to £70,000 but the added value of the stunning location has seen some sell for as much as £200,000.

This means that £130,000 has now been wiped off the value of the 11 chalets.

One owner, who wished not to be named, said: 'Some people are covered by insurance and some are not. Luckily for us our property is.

'We are only allowed to insure it up to £70,000. The total value of ours was £200,000 so the rest of the value is the location and the ongoing licence.

This chalet worth £200,000 has been so badly damaged it could be pulled down before it falls into the sea

'The logistics of taking it down 
would be too difficult so we are going to leave it where it is and it 
will probably end up hitting the beach 30ft below.

'It will only be good for fire wood then.'

Because the cliff is continually moving with no end in sight it is now feared all of the buildings will be written off.

Another chalet owner said: 'Our family have had the chalet over 60 years.

'It’s worth about £200,000 and it’s probably going to end up in the sea the way things are going.

'Our chalet has slipped about six feet in the last six days. It is moving frighteningly fast and there is only one place these chalets are going to end up - on the beach.

'The pressure from the cliffs above is pushing the land down.

'The local council has told us it’s not too bad but they are just burying their heads in the sand.

'There are about 18 chalets which are closed at the moment and are directly affected by the landslides.'

Geologist Richard Edmonds, the earth science manager for Dorset County Council’s Jurassic Coast team, said the continuous movement meant not a lot could be done to save the homes.

'About ten chalets are affected by the movement and I’m afraid it is a matter of waiting and seeing what nature does.

'The last big landslide we had here was in 2008 and we could get another at any time.

'The movement is coming from the back of the cliff and the land is slumping forward because of the rain. That is pushing the chalets forward in the process.'

The chalets are privately owned but the land they are on is owned by Lyme Regis Town Council

A landslide that occurred at Monmouth Beach last month saw a £140,000 chalet, which had only been bought by its new owners last May, toppled over.

The holiday homes, that overlook Lyme Bay, can only be lived in for nine months of the year and are empty over the winter.

They are privately owned but the land they are on is owned by Lyme Regis Town Council which receives £2,500 a year in rent from each plot.

John Wright, town clerk at Lyme Regis 
Town Council, said: 'The licences for 11 chalets will not be renewed 
when the current ones expire on March 1 as things stand.

'We want people to take the appropriate action to remove their properties from the site.

'Our advice at the moment is for people not to go anywhere near their chalets.

'It is impossible to predict how long this will go on for.'

Graham Turner, from Lyme Regis coastguard, said: 'It’s a major problem for the chalet owners.

'The chalets are on concrete pillars and they are being moved forward.

'One went over and was hanging there at angle of about 30 degrees.

'Another four have moved so much that the steps leading up to them are now nowhere near the doors.

'In general the movement is quite slow but it is constant now.

'I just don’t know what can be done to stop it. It is an act of nature.'

Monmouth Beach is named after the Duke of Monmouth, who landed there in 1685 during his attempt to take the crown from King James II.

Following the defeat of the Duke of Monmouth, twelve locals were hanged on the beach.
