Gerrard will call time on his Liverpool career to move to the United States at the end of the season

The former Arsenal said: 'He is clever enough to adapt over there. Saying that, he will arrive in a team that is already on tune. Trust me, they have either been winning or losing in the final every single year. They are a very good organisation.

“But Stevie G is Stevie G. It makes me laugh when I see people talking about him the way that they have been recently.'

Henry spent four years in New York with the Red Bulls having made his name in the Premier League with Arsenal.

The French striker said it would have been an honour to play alongside the Liverpool midfielder

The Frenchman has now called time on his career, but admitted he would have loved to play alongside Gerrard.

'As a midfielder, he was for me unstoppable — along with Paul Scholes.

'We had so many battles and I always used to say to him "It would have been an honour to play with you".

'He is the dream for any striker. Ask Fernando Torres. Ask Luis Suarez. Ask any striker who has played with him.'
