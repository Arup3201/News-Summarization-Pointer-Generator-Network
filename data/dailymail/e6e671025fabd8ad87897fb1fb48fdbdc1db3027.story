A shameless criminal who boasted that he was too busy running a drugs empire to be guilty of a gangland killing has finally been locked up. 

Milad Finn, 24, from Cheadle, Greater Manchester, was acquitted of killing 21-year-old Junaid Khan last year after he told the jury he had in fact been involved in a lucrative heroin deal at the time.

Police used his evidence to charge him with drugs offences instead and he has now been jailed for six years.

Gangland feud: Milad Finn, 24, from Cheadle, Stockport, was acquitted of murdering Junaid Khan, 21, last year after claiming he was too busy running a drugs empire to have carried out the killing. Police used his evidence to charge him with drugs offences instead and he has now been locked up for six years

During his testimony in August 2011, Finn boasted of making £340,000 from dealing crack cocaine and heroin and even imported material from China to help maximise his profits.

Finn went free for nine months but was rearrested last May after determined detectives left smarting by the not guilty verdict obtained legal transcripts and examined his courtroom claims. They later corroborated his testimony with witnesses.

At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Finn was jailed for six years after he admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine, production of cannabis, converting criminal property and encouraging or assisting the commission of offences.

The court heard he had been arrested for murder after 21-year old Junaid Khan was cut down in a hail of 16 bullets as he stood in the car park of a doctor’s surgery in Oldham in July 2009.

In the days before the shooting the dead man had feared for his life and wore a bullet proof vest after he was named as a 'marked man' following the disappearance of a £175,000 cannabis crop.

During the murder trial, Finn, from Cheadle, near Stockport, was said to be the hitman who had been paid by two brothers to kill Khan.

It was claimed he confessed to carrying out the killing to a fellow gangster whilst they were 'having a moan' about police.

It was also alleged he used spy-style tracking equipment to remotely stalk Khan before gunning him down.

But Finn told a jury he had been helping an associate involved in another shooting at the time of Khan’s murder and knew nothing of the killing until he saw a TV news report about it in a gym.

He then made 'extensive admissions' to the jury regarding his drug dealing activities to counter evidence against him. Finn said he became a drug dealer at 15 for a crime boss before setting up on his own.

He went into detail about how he imported large quantities of caffeine and Benzocaine to act as mixing agents mixing agents to maximise his profits as his orders grew.

He said a cash haul seized at his home was drug money and not payment for the murder and that a flurry of mobile phone calls he made at the time of the killing was linked to a heroin deal.

Finn said the spy equipment was part of a schemes to rob other drug dealers.

He insisted to the jury: “All I did was help a friend. That’s why I’m stood in front of you.'

He will now face a Proceeds of Crime hearing as a result of his confessions.

Today Det Sgt Mark Lucas of Greater Manchester Police said: 'By his own admissions Finn started dealing drugs at 15 before expanding and setting up on his own.

'He quickly established himself as a prominent dealer across our region and is worryingly at ease sourcing and distributing large amounts of class A drugs.

'While we can’t quantify the amounts of drugs or cash that passed hands while he ran his criminal enterprise, the figures for both are undoubtedly substantial.'

Three other men were also acquitted of Khan’s murder at the trial.

A fifth suspect is holed out in Pakistan.

No one has been convicted over the killing.

At the time of the not guilty verdict Junaid Khan’s father Mumtaz Khan, 63, a shopkeeper, said:

'Someone should get punished but I don’t think justice will ever be done.

'My son is no longer here. He was a good person and he was taken away from us.

'We are all going to die one day and on Judgement Day Junaid’s killers will not get away from God.'
