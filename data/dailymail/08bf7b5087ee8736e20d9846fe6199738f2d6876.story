Margaret Thatcher was behind radical proposals to end free healthcare and schooling in Britain which proved so contentious they sparked what was described as a 'riot' in cabinet, newly-released documents reveal.

A 1982 cabinet memorandum by the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS), released today under the National Archives under the 30-year-rule, details plans for a massive scaling back of public services.

According to her memoirs, Mrs Thatcher was 'horrified' when she first saw the paper which was never seriously considered by her or any of her ministers.

Rolling back the frontiers: Mrs Thatcher and her then chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe commissioned a think tank to come up with radical plans to cut public spending, newly-released documents reveal

She wrote: ' I pointed out that it would almost certainly be leaked and give a totally false impression.

'It was all a total nonsense.'

However records show that not only was the memorandum fully considered at an extended cabinet discussion on September 9, 1982, but that Mrs Thatcher and her then Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe had requested the CPRS to come up with such radical suggestions in the first place.

According to Nigel Lawson, who was the energy Secretary at the time, the incendiary report sparked 'the nearest thing to a cabinet riot in the history of the Thatcher administration.'

Despite Mrs Thatcher's public 
denunciation of the report, it was, in reality, far from the product of a
renegade group of radical right-wingers acting purely off their own 
initiative.

According to a report in the Guardian,
The newly released documents show how it had been commissioned by Mrs 
Thatcher and Mr Howe with the latter telling the PM: 'We should not be 
inhibited at this stage by such considerations as the alleged 
impossibility of change.

Nigel Lawson said the report nearly prompted a riot in the cabinet

'A discussion of this kind would pave the
way for some major strategic decisions affecting our programmes as a 
government for the next parliament.'

One of the authors was 
David Cameron's current advisor on crime and policing, Lord Wasserman, 
who, in a background paper for the education section, proposed cutting 
25 per cent of state-school teachers.

A copy of the report was subsequently leaked to the press which proposed the introduction of education vouchers, an ending state-funded higher education, freezing welfare benefits and an insurance-based health service similar to the US system.

But what was not known at the time was that this was merely a watered-down version of the real thing which went far further.

The original version included such radical proposals as compulsory charges for schooling as well as a 'drastic reduction in resources going to the public sector'.

There would also be no deductions in university fees and a breaking of the link between welfare benefits and prices.

But by far the paper's most contentious proposal was to end the state provision of healthcare which would have effectively meant an end to the NHS.

It reads: 'It is therefore worth considering aiming over a period to end the state provision of healthcare for the bulk of the population, so that medical facilities would be privately owned and run and those seeking healthcare would be required to pay for it.

'Those who could not afford to pay would then have their charges met by the state, via some form of rebating or reimbursement.'

Mentally handicapped or elderly patients requiring long term institutional care who 'clearly could not afford to pay', would be the only exceptions.
