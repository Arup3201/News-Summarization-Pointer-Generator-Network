Spark believe that the first attack occurred after a handful of users clicked on links believing they would lead to new illicit images of celebrities but instead the link installed viruses that crippled the IP.

The cyber attack comes after a user uploaded a list of many high profile stars in the nude.

The photos included The Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence, singer and actress Ariana Grande and Bristish model Cara Delevigne among many more.

While some photographs were stolen from Apple's iCloud storage system but many celebrities have come out and denied the photos being real.

From Friday night Spark took to Twitter and Facebook to inform their users that they were on the case.

Spark tweeted that when people clicked on some links they inadvertently installed malware 'generating a high amount of traffic to overseas sites'.

Trend Micro a computer security company issued alerts after the New Zealand cyber attack warning users not to open the links related to illicit photographs.

Customers were not pleased that they were cut off from cyberspace for a whole weekend

'For obvious reasons, clicking on links to 'naked celebrity' photos, or opening email attachments, would be a very bad idea right now. Expect criminals to ride this bandwagon immediately,' it said.

'Our scanning brought to our attention some freshly-concocted schemes targeting those looking for the photos borne from the aforementioned leak.

'The first threat we found hails from Twitter, in the form of a tweet being posted with hashtags that contain the name of one of the leak's victims - Jennifer Lawrence.'

New Zealand authorities told ABC News they did not know who was behind the attack, which was launched from outside the country.

From Friday to Sunday Spark Engineers worked to repair the damage caused by malware
