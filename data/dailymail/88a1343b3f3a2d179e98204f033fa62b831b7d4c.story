Angel di Maria's imminent £59.7million deal to join Manchester United will help improve Juan Mata, according to Gary Neville.

The former Red Devils defender believes that the signing of Di Maria will help get the best out of Mata, with the Argentine's movement off-the-ball proving beneficial to the playmaker.

It's been a sluggish start for Mata and United this season but Neville believes the addition of Di Maria will help the Spaniard flourish in new boss Louis van Gaal's 3-5-2 formation.

'I think that he (Di Maria) will improve Juan Mata,' he told Sky Sports show Monday Night Football.

'Mata relies on people running past him. He manipulates the ball, shifts it from side to side but then he relies upon the runs and the fact that United are playing without great pace in the team at the moment isn't helping him at all.

'His goal record from central positions has been good. He's scored seven goals in 10 central appearances. That's a good reward.

'He isn't any good out wide, that's why he left Chelsea, he had assurances that he was going to play in central areas, that's part of the reason why Louis van Gaal is playing the system that he's playing - to get Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata in the team. We'll now see how he integrates Di Maria into the team.

'Don't worry about the fact that you have too many important players that you might not be able to fit in. You'll need them in a season of 40-050 games.'

Despite the deal to bring Di Maria to Old Trafford, Neville believes United need to strengthen in other areas if they are to improve on last season's disappointing seventh place finish.

The deposed Premier League champions are depleted in defence and midfield at present, and Neville has cited these two areas as must for the club to improve on before the transfer window closes on September 1.

'United need a central midfield player - a robust central midfield player - and they also need a centre back of real stature,' he added.

Ajax utility player Daley Blind, AC Milan's Nigel de Jong and Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal are among those linked with the club before the window expires.
