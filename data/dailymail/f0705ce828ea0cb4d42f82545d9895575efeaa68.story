Reunited: Margaret Charles, 79, feared she would never see her Cairn Terrier Maisie again

A pet dog found alive after going missing for eight days in freezing -15C conditions during Britain's cold snap has been reunited with her delighted owner.Â 

Cairn Terrier Maisie disappeared after her owner Margaret Charles fell over during a walk in Dunwich Heath National Park in east Suffolk, sparking a large-scale search.

Incredibly, the three-year-old dog managed to survive for eight days without food and water by creating an igloo for herself.

She was eventually found trapped by a tree by a volunteer with a tracker dog.

Maisie has now been reunited with her delighted owner Mrs Charles, 79, who said she thought she would never see her pet dog alive again.

Mother-of-two Mrs Charles, of Middleton, near Aldeburgh, Suffolk, said: 'It's just incredible that I've got Maisie back.

'I'm so happy to get her back alive and in one piece.

'I didn't think I'd see Maisie alive again as she was out in this terrible cold.

'I was at the end of my tether and I couldn't function normally, I was so worried for her.

'Maisie is my whole life, I love her to bits. I couldn't imagine never seeing her again.'

Maisie had run off after Margaret slipped on black ice while walking her on Dunwich Heath on January 16.

Mrs Charles spent the next week trying to find Maisie with the help of friends and family but with no success.

Jenny Brown, a volunteer with Dog Lost which helps trace missing dogs, then offered to help the search by bringing her highly-skilled tracker dog Tigger up from Kent the next day.

Incredibly, Ms Brown and her dog Tigger found Maisie, who had become trapped after her lead somehow snagged on a tree, within just a few hours.

She was incredibly hungry and dehydrated but otherwise unharmed.

Mrs Charles said: 'Maisie was found not far from where I fell but her retractable lead had got caught on a tree meaning she couldn't walk any further.

'I was trembling and crying and didn't know what to do with myself but managed to get into my car and drive to where Maisie was.

'She had covered herself with snow to insulate herself, which was very clever. These dogs come from the Cairngorms in Scotland and I think that being very tough must be in their DNA.

Found just in time: Maisie was finally found by Dog Lost volunteer Jenny Brown and her tracker dog Tigger

Back together again: Margaret Charles took Maisie to the vet who gave her a clean bill of health after her ordeal

'The main thing was that she was okay and I got her back safe and sound.'

Mrs Charles took Maisie straight to the vets where she was given a clean bill of health despite her eight-day ordeal.

'She's obviously lost some weight and we can see her ribs', Mrs Charles added.

'But I've given her a few treats to welcome her back and we~ll take things nice and steady as we get her back to normal.'

Dog Lost volunteer Jenny Brown said: 'A lot of searches had already been carried out in a difficult area and in difficult conditions with the snow and cold temperatures.

'I don't think Margaret expected to see her Maisie ever again and she took some convincing that we had found her and she was absolutely fine.

'I was so pleased for them both that we found her.'
