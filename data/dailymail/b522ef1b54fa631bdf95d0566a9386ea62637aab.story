A blogger who called a local politician a 'c***' on Twitter sparked a row over freedom of speech after being convicted of sending the offensive remark.

John Graham Kerlan who blogs under the name Olly Cromwell, faces jail after Councillor Melvyn Seymour complained.

Kerlan, who was attacking Bexley Council in south east London, posted an image of Mr Seymour's house, as well as a tweet saying: 'Which c*** lives in a house like this. Answers on a postcard to #bexleycouncil.'

The 37-year-old went on to post 
another message in which he appeared to encourage other Twitter users to
 post excrement to the house he had identified.

A later tweet read: 'It’s silly 
posting a picture of a house on Twitter without an address, that will 
come later. Please feel free to post actual s**t.'

It is unclear whether Mr Kerlen went on to post the address of the councillor.

Mr Kerlen was arrested after a 
complaint from the councillor in question, and was charged with an 
offence under Section 127 of the Telecommunications Act 2003.

John Graham Kerlan faces jail after he attacked Bexley councillor Melvyn Seymour on Twitter. 

Here are some of the tweets which led to his conviction.

'Which c*** lives in a house like this. Answers on a postcard to #bexleycouncil.'

'It’s silly 
posting a picture of a house on Twitter without an address, that will 
come later. Please feel free to post actual s**t.'

And in a case which could have huge legal repercussions for Twitter and its millions of users, Kerlen was convicted of the offence by Greenwich magistrates and now faces a possible jail term.

His legal battle has since been 
supported in large numbers on Twitter, where the hashtag 
#freethebexleyone became a trending topic.

Political campaigner and blogger Mark Wallace wrote: 'Shockingly, a man has been convicted for swearing on twitter.'

Another Twitter user called Nick wrote: 'This has far ranging implications for free speech.'

Royston Westbrook also tweeted in support, saying: 'If someone wants to call someone else a c*** that is their choice, and their opinion.'

Mr Kerlen, whose website was not 
working today and claimed on his Twitter page that he had been 'censored
 by the state' appeared before Bexley magistrates in January.

He denied sending an offensive or obscene message by means of a public electronic communication network.

But last week he was convicted of making a grossly offensive and menacing comment on Twitter, thought to be towards Mr Seymour.

Taking action: Kerlen's Twitter page on which he claims he has been 'censored by the state'. The page was at the centre of his conviction

Trending: The hashtag #FreeTheBexleyOne became a hot topic on Twitter after Kerlen's conviction

He has been handed a restraining order that ordered him:

Mr Kerlen, from Millwards, Essex, has been granted conditional bail until his sentencing on May 9. He could receive a custodial sentence of up to six months in jail.

A spokesman for Bexley Council said: 'The council is totally supportive of freedom of expression and political debate.

'The council is of the view that Kerlen's actions went beyond the limits of what is both acceptable and reasonable in terms of freedom of expression.'

The case follows that of Azhar Ahmed, 19, who has denied posting a grossly offensive message on Facebook about the deaths of six British soldiers in Afghanistan.

He has appeared in court charged under the Communications Act 2003 with sending a message that was grossly offensive on March 8.

Ahmed, from Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire, was bailed and will stand trial at Huddersfield Magistrates’ Court on July 3.
