Boris Kovalyov may only be 32 but he has spent most of his adult life serving in some of Russia's toughest prisons.

Within months of being released early from a sentence for theft at a prison camp near the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, he was sent back for drug-trafficking.

There he endured one of the hardest penal regimes in the world.

Daily chores: Inmate Boris Kovalyov, 32, was sentenced to eight years in a high-security prison camp for drug trafficking

Stark: The male prison camp outside Russia's Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk where some of the country's most serious or prolific criminals are jailed

Heightened security: Men considered especially dangerous are kept in a separate zone (pictured) with even stricter conditions

Exercise: Like most prisons, Krasnoyarsk works to a tight schedule. Here, inmates walk inside an enclosure at a high-security male prison camp for their daily exercise

Inmates: Prisoners at camp number 17 tend to be men who are serving their first sentences for serious offences. Pictured left, they stand in formation in the bitter cold

Penal system: Russia is thought to have about 850,000 convicts in its prison system. About 60,000 of them are women who are held in single-sex camps

Russian law means that if a convict reoffends, they must serve the time they were spared by release.

He was sentenced to eight years in a high-security prison camp and after
two years at a prison near the village of Ariyskhe, he was moved back to the strict prison of Krasnoyarsk.

Guards holding rifles can be seen watching constantly from observation towers as visitors move in and out of the 'zone'.

Visitors must surrender their passports and ID cards before even stepping into the main buildings.

The weather also does not help the feeling of isolation at the prison either.

Siberia suffers long cold winters where temperatures inside the camp can fall to as low as -11C.

Krasnoyarsk houses many inmates who have multiple convictions for serious crimes.

But the Gulag tag is now, partially at least, in the past.

The penal system that solely focussed on punishment has given way slightly to one of reform.

Prisoners at camp number five work in wood and metal processing shops, 
manufacture furniture, sew clothes and do other kinds of work.

They can 
also take part in educational, sport and cultural programmes.

Unlike the Gulags of the past, inmates are encouraged to pray.

Behind bars: Boris Kovalyov stands inside a cell as he receives a letter from his wife. He spent much of his adult life in prison

Competitor: Kovalyov plays an accordion as he prepares for an inter-prison talent contest. He earned a degree and captained sports during his incarceration

Anticipation: Kovalyov, 32, walks through the prison in the days leading up to his early release for good behaviour and participation in sports and cultural activities

A free man: Kovalyov, 32, walks out of the discharge procedure after completing six and a half years of his eight year sentence for drug trafficking

New life: Kovalyov, 32, (centre) could not hide his emotions as he met his wife Galina (right) and a relative after being released

A 19th century wooden church was disassembled on the suburbs of Krasnoyarsk and transported to the prison for the inmates.

It is through the education programmes that inmates such as Mr Kovalyov are given their best chance at success - and early release. 

He finished high school while serving his sentence and received a degree through his study. 

Mr Kovalyov also threw himself into extra-curricular activities.

Photojounalist Ilya Naymushin, who visited the prison, said Mr Kovalyov 
learned editing and produced reports for his fellow inmates and worked 
as a cameraman on the prison television station.

He also became a joiner and machinist in the camp and also captained the football, volleyball and basketball teams.

Mr Naymushin said it was that attitude which set him apart.

He said: 'Boris adapted to this environment well, finding a common language with prisoners and personnel.'

It was at one of his clubs that Mr Kovalyov discovered that he was being
released two and a half years before the end of his sentence in 2015.

Mr Naymushin said photographing the inmate as he left the camp was very emotional.

The former inmate, then a free man, was met by his wife Galina, who stood by him despite his years inside.

Security: An officer searches an inmate at a control point between work and residential zones. Even visitors must surrender their ID cards and passports at the gate

Dinner time: The queue of inmates waiting for their meals at Krasnoyarsk prison stretches back across the entire room

Hungry: Inmates serve their fellow prisoners food such as soup, bread and vegetables

Religious life: An Orthodox priest leads the Easter service among inmates inside an Orthodox church set inside the high-security prison camp

Orthodox church: The 19th century wooden church was disassembled from the nearby city of Krasnoyarsk and transferred into the camp

Gloomy: They may not be furnished with the home comforts of the past but the prison is a far cry from the Gulag conditions last century

Jobs: A worker stands on his tip toes as he tries to hang out dozens of sheets. Prison inmates are given jobs including working at the bath and laundry building.

Learning skills: Some prisoners take part in lessons at the metal processing shop within the prison camp walls

Mr Naymushin said: 'I saw him part with friends in prison and, 20 paces later, 
greet others waiting outside the gate. They tried to restrain their 
emotions, but he could not.

'Five and a half years in prison camp were behind him. Ahead – the 
chance of a new life. Whether he will take it or end up behind the 
barbed wire again is unknown.'

Although improved, prisons in Russia are still suffocating places.

Mr Naymushin said: 'I have been taking photographs in the prison camps of Siberia for about 15 years, so my first impressions were of the past. One can get used to a lot of things, prison among them, but even a short time inside these places brings on a stark, visceral feeling that the restriction of freedom is contradictory to human nature.

Russia is thought to have about 850,000 convicts in its prison system, with many sentenced to forced labour. About 60,000 prisoners are women, held in single-sex camps.

As of 2010, about 560 out of every 100,000 people in Russia were behind bars.

Russia incarcerates more people than any country in the world bar the United States and China, according to the International Centre for Prison Studies.

Unglamorous work: Inmates straighten old iron wire for metal work in the bitter Siberian cold

Security measures: Some prisoners are on lock-down and have to be fed in their cells as they are under particularly strict conditions

Lock down: A prisoner, deemed especially dangerous, is served a bowl of food through a hatch in his cell

New inmates: Three men stand with shaven heads after being brought to the prison and watch TV until they are moved to the correct areas
