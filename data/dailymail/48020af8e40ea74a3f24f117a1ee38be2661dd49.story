Claims of innocence: Ex-Marine Jorge Torrez, 26, pleaded not guilty Thursday to stabbing to death two girls as they were playing in a forest preserve in Illinois in 2005 

A former Marine already sentenced to death in the killing of a sailor in Virginia pleaded not guilty on Thursday to the 2005 murders of two young Illinois girls who were playing in a forest preserve.

The plea by Jorge Torrez, 26, comes days after he was returned from Virginia by the Lake County State's Attorney, who has vowed to try him even though he received the death penalty in Virginia.

Authorities contend that 8-year-old Laura Hobbs and 9-year-old Krystal Tobias were playing in the forest preserve in Zion, where they lived, on Mother's Day of 2005 when Torrez, at the time a 16-year-old friend of Tobias' older brother, allegedly stabbed them to death.

The girls' killings generated national media attention, both because of the brutality of the crime and because Laura Hobbs' father, Jerry Hobbs, was charged in the slayings after giving what he said was a false confession following a 24-hour interrogation session. 

Mr Hobbs spent five years in jail before DNA evidence from his daughter's body linked Torrez to the crime.

Earlier this year, Torrez, a native of Zion, was convicted in federal court in the slaying of a female sailor at a barracks in northern Virginia. 

Tragic friends: Krystal Tobias, 9, and Laura Hobbs, 8, were stabbed to death on Mother's Day. Torrez knew the girls because he was a friend of Krystal's older brother

During the sentencing phase of the trial, prosecutors told jurors that Torrez had killed the two girls. They showed jurors photos of one of the girl's bodies that had stab wounds and told them that Torrez had confessed to a fellow inmate that he stabbed the girls.

Illinois does not have a death penalty, but even before Torrez was convicted in Virginia, Lake County State's Attorney Mike Nerheim said he intended to bring Torrez back to the state to stand trial  and that the girl's families supported his decision and even sent one of his prosecutors to observe part of Torrez' trial in Virginia.

'This is important to the victims' families, to the entire community,' said Nerheim, who was not state's attorney when Jerry Hobbs was arrested. 'There are few things that can be worse than two little girls murdered on Mother's Day and I do think this will be part of the healing process and bring closure.'

Torrez was sentenced to death in Virginia for the murder of Navy Petty Officer Amanda Snell, 20, a Las Vegas native, at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Arlington, in a barracks where the two lived a few doors down from each other.

The 26-year-old ex-Marine also had been sentenced to five life sentenced, plus 168 years, in connection to 2010 attacks on three women in Virginia, one of whom was raped and left for dead.

Torrez is currently being held withouht bond. His trial is expected to get under way January 26, Daily Herald reported.

If convicted, the Virginia death row inmate could face up to 100 years in prison in Illinois.
