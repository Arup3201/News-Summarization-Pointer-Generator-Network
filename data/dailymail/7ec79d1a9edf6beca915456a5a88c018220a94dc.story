Straight-talking TV presenter Jeremy Kyle has revealed he feared he would die after being diagnosed with testicular cancer.

The father-of-four, who suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder, said he had put off visiting a doctor after discovering a lump in December, believing he was just being 'paranoid'.

After cancelling his first appointment with a doctor, he was later diagnosed with cancer just before Christmas and underwent surgery the following day.

Tearful: Jeremy Kyle returned to work on Wednesday and was moved to tears by the audience's support

The 47-year-old said the support of his devoted wife Carla helped him through the treatment, which included chemotherapy and removal of a testicle.

He told The Sun: 'It's been a horrific time - a very sobering experience - but now I just feel lucky to be alive.

'I feel lucky that I'm here for family and can see my kids grow up.

'To be honest, I thought, 'That's it, I'm dead'. The phone call I made to Carla was one of the most difficult of my life.'

Kyle, who has now been given the all-clear and returned to work, said doctors told him he could have died within 18 months if the lump remained unchecked.

In a sombering interview Kyle, who has just launched his show in America, said this Christmas was a difficult time as he watched children Alice, nine, Ava, seven, Harry, three and 22-year-old daughter Hattie from a previous relationship, open presents.

Former gambling addict Kyle admitted he thought it would be the last year he would be able to be with his family - a sobering thought for the chat show host.

Further tests revealed that the cancer had not spread to other parts of his body, but he was ordered to undergo chemotherapy as a precaution, which he described as 'like having a permanent migraine' and as if he had been 'shot in every limb'.

Kyle, who launched his show in the US in 2011, returned to filming for his ITV show in Manchester to a standing ovation.

Jeremy told The Daily Mirror: 'It has been the hardest two months of my life. I have had absolutely amazing support. Thank you all – it is overwhelming really.

'And just so you know, I only have one testicle left. But I’ve got a false one and it only cost £289.99!'

Visibly shaken Kyle wiped away tears as the audience applauded his return to the studio where he interviewed Amy Winehouse’s ex Blake Fielder-Civil on his relationship with the singer.

Jeremy said he is grateful that he has survived his terrifying cancer battle and added although he was paranoid everyone will be looking at his trousers, he would rather have a prosthetic testicle than not be around to see his four children grow up.

Testicular cancer usually affects men aged between 15 and 44.

The most common symptom is a painless lump or swelling in the testicles, though others include a 'heaviness' or dull ache in the scrotum.

It is relatively uncommon, accounting for just one per cent of all cancers in men, and unusual in that it tends to affect younger men.

Around 2,090 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer every year in Britain. White men are five times more likely to develop it than black men. It is not understood why.

The number of cases of testicular cancer in Britain has doubled since the mid-1970s. Again, the reasons are not known.

Testicular cancer is one of the most treatable forms of the disease. More than 95 per cent of men with early stage testicular cancer will be completely cured, and there is an 80 per cent survival rate even when it spreads to other tissue.

Deaths are relatively rare, with around 70 men dying from it in Britain each year.

Treatment includes chemotherapy and the surgical removal of the affected testicle, which should not affect fertility or the ability to have sex as the other testicle increases sperm production.
