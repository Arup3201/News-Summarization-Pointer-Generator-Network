Manchester City took advantage of Chelsea's slip against Newcastle to reduce the lead at the top of the Premier League table following their 1-0 defeat of Everton at the Etihad Stadium. 

Sergio Aguero lasted only a few minutes before being forced off with a thigh injury but Yaya Toure scored the match-winner from the penalty spot after Phil Jagielka had fouled James Milner.

With Sergio Aguero injured, Samir Nasri was City's most influential player during the hard-fought victory

MANCHESTER CITY 4-4-1-1 

Joe Hart 6.5 

Had few chances to prove he’s worth that new £120,000-a-contract but produced the goods when it mattered to deny Lukaku

Pablo Zabaleta 6 

Another solid performance from City’s Mr Reliable. No need for the ‘baby’ goal celebrations this time though.

Eliaquim Mangala 6.5 

Gave one of his more assured performances on his return from suspension and won the heavyweight battle with Lukaku.

England keeper Joe Hart pulled off a series of saves to ensure the points were not shared

Martin Demichelis 6.5 

Didn’t put a foot wrong and produced a fantastic challenge to deny Eto’o right at the death.

Gael Clichy 6 

Did a good job keeping Seamus Coleman quiet down the Everton right and got forward well when required.

Jesus Navas 6.5 

A real handful for Leighton Baines with his electric pace, although end product sometimes lacking.

Yaya Toure 6.5 

Converted the penalty after playing the pass that won it, but a little subdued after hurting his right knee towards the end of the first half.

Fernando 5.5 

Restored to the starting line-up and lucky to only receive a yellow card for a reckless high challenge on City old boy Gareth Barry

James Milner 7 

Won the penalty and a constant menace throughout down the left but volleyed a great chance wide with only Howard to beat.

Samir Nasri 7.5 

Deployed behind the striker due to injuries and at the heart of all City’s best moments with his movement and trickery.

Sergio Aguero 6 

The Argentine has been in the form of his life but lasted just 75 seconds before he went off with an injury to his left knee.

Subs:  Lampard (for Navas 77), Dzeko (for Pozo 62), Pozo 6 (for Aguero 7).

EVERTON 

Tim Howard 6.5 

Had no chance with the penalty but produced a fine reflex save from substitute Pozo in the second half to keep Everton in it.

Tony Hibbert 6 

Had his hands full with Milner down the City left and when Nasri drifted wide to give him even more problems.

Phil Jagielka 6 

Can count himself unfortunate to have been penalised for the challenge on Milner. A lot of referees wouldn’t have given that.

Sylvain Distin 6.5 

Former City defender is still doing the business at the age of 36. Snuffed out the danger on more than one occasion.

Leighton Baines 5.5 

Difficult to make his usual forays forward with Navas keeping him on the back foot so much of the time.

Muhamed Besic 5.5 

No malice intended for Aguero injury. Replaced early in the second half as Everton looked to attack more.

Gareth Barry 5 

Lucky the officials didn’t spot his forearm into Milner’s face when he was already on a booking for fouling his old teammate.

Samuel Eto'o (2nd right) was one of the few Everton players to do himself justice

Seamus Coleman 5.5 

A quiet game by his standards. Never really got going and posed little threat to the City defence.

Samuel Eto’o 7 

Received treatment after an early knee in the back from Mangala but still proved to be a real handful.

Kevin Mirallas 5 

Disappointing from a player who can do a lot better. Should have been more effective with set-pieces as well.

Romelu Lukaku 6 

The big Belgian was kept very quiet by Mangala and Demichelis, but went close with a volley late in the game.

Subs: Barkley 6.5 (for Besic 56), Osman (for Mirallas 88)

Referee: Andre Marriner 5

Star man: Samir Nasri
