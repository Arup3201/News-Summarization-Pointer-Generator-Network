A shocking video has shown the moment a father-of-two was Tased by police and arrested for refusing to give his name as he waited to pick up his kids after school.

Christopher Lollie, 28, was arrested after the incident in St Paul, Minnesota on January 31, but after witness statements and the video, they have now dropped the charges, he said.

Lollie was sitting near his children's school after working an overnight cleaning shift when a security guard approached him and told him to move because it was a private area.

Not seeing any signs indicating this, Lollie refused and the security guard called police, the Pioneer Press reported. As Lollie got up and headed to the school, officers arrived and caught up with him.

Arrest: Chris Lollie, 28, was Tased and arrested after he refused to give his name to police after he was caught sitting in a private area in downtown St Paul. He said no signs indicated it was private

On the video taken on his cell phone - which he says he only got back recently after it was confiscated by the police - Lollie can be heard calmly asking why they need his name as he walks.

'Why do I have to let you know who I am?' Lollie asks the officer. 'I don't have to let you know who I am if I haven't broken any laws.'

When a female officer, later identified as Lori Hayne, refuses to say what he has done wrong and repeatedly asks for his name, he responds: 'The problem is I'm black.... I didn't do anything wrong.'

As they near his children's pick-up point, another two officers, Michael Johnson and Bruce Schmidt, approached them and can be heard asking him to put his hands behind his back. Again Lollie insists he has done nothing wrong.

Altercation: Two male officers, Michael Johnson and Bruce Schmidt, pictured, then approach them and a scuffle ensues. He is eventually knocked to the ground, Tased and taken into custody

Moments later, he is apparently knocked to the ground and the footage goes dark, but he can be heard screaming for help as he is held on the ground.

One of the officers orders him to put his hands behind his back 'otherwise, it's going to get ugly'.

Taken in: The multiple charges against Lollie, pictured in his mugshot, have now been dropped

He claims that police Tased him, put their hands on his throat and ripped his jacket open. 

Police Chief Thomas Smith explained in a statement that police had responded to a report of Lollie trespassing in a private area and had attempted to talk to him - but he wouldn't cooperate. 

In their report, police said Lollie had been 'actively resisting by attempting to pull his arm away' and 'began to forcefully try to shove past us as he was pulling away from us'.

When he was 'becoming uncontrollable', they used the Taser on him, the report said.

'They used the force necessary to safely take him into custody,' Smith's statement said. 

Dave Titus, St. Paul Police Federation president, added: 'These three cops in the skyway, you couldn't get nicer individuals. This guy was acting like a jerk.'

Lollie was charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct and obstructing legal process, but all counts were dismissed on July 31 after Lollie's attorney showed the video and witness statements in court.

He told the Pioneer Press that when the police approached him, he tried hard to remain calm 'because I know if I do anything outside of these bounds, they could really do some damage to me'.

He said that it was heartbreaking knowing that some of his four-year-old daughter's friends and teachers had seen the altercation.

'One of the kids in the class that saw what happened (later) said, "When I saw them doing that to Allahna's daddy, it made my heart feel so sad",' Lollie said.

He said he is considering a lawsuit.
