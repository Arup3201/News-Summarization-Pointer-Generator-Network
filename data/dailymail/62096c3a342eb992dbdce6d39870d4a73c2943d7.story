One is a  palatial 19th Century manor house with five bedrooms, surrounded by long, sloping fields.

The other is a studio flat in the heart of London, in which tenants cook and sleep in the same room.

However, in a stark example of the north-south divide, both are available to rent for almost exactly the same price.

Impressive: Sandhoe Hall, a 19th Century country manor set in 11 acres of woodland in the Tyne Valley, is available on the rental market for just £2,250 a month

Luxurious: This studio flat in Knightsbridge, London, is on the rental market for a higher price than the mansion in Northumberland - at £2,300 per month

Residents in Northumberland can find themselves living in the Grade II-listed country house Sandhoe Hall  for just £2,225 per month.

Based north of Corbridge, it is set in 11 acres of wooded grounds,  overlooking the stunning Tyne Valley.

However, in Knightsbridge, London, a studio apartment in the luxorious Park Mansions costs slightly more at £2,300 a month.

The flat  -  which is available for £575 per week - is located close to Hyde Park and is close to upmarket retail outlets such as Harrods.

Spacious: The five-bedroom Sandhoe Hall offers a combination of formal reception rooms, with a separate flat also available for guests or staff

Historic: The house boasts high rise ceilings, period fire places and stained glass windows

Acres: The London studio flat is surrounded by busy roads and a popular shopping district. The view from Sandhoe Hall could not be any more different

It combines a living room, bedroom and kitchenette into a single room.

But despite its sought-after location, it cannot boast the same impressive features as the Northumberland mansion.

The house was designed by the renowned architect John Dobson in 1850 for Sir Rowland Errington and has remained with the Errington family for generations.

Expensive: The Knightsbridge flat is in one of London's most sought-after areas. But it is not surrounded by the same sweeping fields as the Northumberland property

Amenities: The Knightsbridge flat is tastefully decorated and close to some of the country's most high-profile shops

Smaller: Unlike the mansion in Northumberland, which has five bedrooms, the studio flat comes with just one

The five-bedroom property offers a combination of formal reception rooms, with a separate flat also available for guests or staff.

Crystal chandeliers hang from the ceilings and leather armchairs fill the mountains of space.

South of the house is a lawned terrace with paths leading off around the wooded grounds and below to further terraces with an arched lime walkway and ornamental pond.

The mansion is available to rent for an initial period of three years by agents Smiths Gore’s.

Michelle Austin, letting agent, said: 'This is an incredibly prestigious rental property.

'It would suit a dual-life family who perhaps are looking to experience life in the North East before making a commitment to buy.

'The rooms are big with lots of original features and it is very private property, something I’m sure you wouldn’t find living in London.

'It is definitely cheap for what you get for your money, you could be lord of the manor in this property!'

'Sandhoe hall is based in the nice little hamlet of Sandhoe with a neighbouring school and great access to Newcastle via the A69.

Peter Rollings, of Marsh & Parsons, which is offering the London flat for rent, said: 

'It’s not uncommon for studio apartments in prime areas of London such as Knightsbridge to command rents at this level.'

Large: This is one of the many rooms inside the spectacular mansion

Stunning: The entrances to Sandhoe Hall are also very impressive
