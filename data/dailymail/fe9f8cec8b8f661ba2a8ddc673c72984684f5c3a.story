Police are revealing more details about the grisly murder of four women in a Tulsa, Oklahoma, apartment yesterday, but admitted that they are not close to a suspect.

Each of the women - including 23-year-old twins, had been shot to death in the crime-ridden neighborhood.

The twins were identified as Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Melchor, and the other victims were Misty Nunley, 33; and Julie Jackson, 55.

Police initially said the victims were in their late teens and early 20s and that the boy who survived was age 4.

Aside from the twins, did not say how the women knew each other or if they were related.

Detectives and officers were 'beating the bushes' to figure out what happened, police spokesman Leland Ashley said Monday.

He added: 'Right now, we have no clear-cut suspect. I don't want to strike fear in the community tonight, but we do have an individual or individuals who murdered four people. Do we know if there was a motive, like a jealous lover? We don't know that. We can't say if it was random or if someone knew [the victims].'

According to reports, police and EMS 
workers were called to the apartment near 61st Street and Peoria Avenue 
at 12:36 p.m. after an unidentified person stumbled across the corpses.

At the run-down apartment complex, bed sheets or cardboard hang as improvised draperies in many windows behind a black wrought-iron gate.

The guard shack is empty and signs read 'Curfew 10 p.m. for everyone, everyday' and 'Photo ID required to be on property.' Three of the units are burned out and boarded up with plywood.

Riverwood has long been plagued by crime, and Tulsa police say there were two murders in the Fairmont Terrace Apartments in 2012.

Residents say gunfire and break-ins are part of the pattern of their everyday lives.

'We're in the eye of the storm,' says Charles Burke, a 48-year-old construction worker. 'You're on your toes. You can't be too careful.'

Neighbor Jamie Kramer, a 28-year-old mother of two young children, has lived at the apartment complex for 10 years.

She said the crime seems to come in cycles and that things had been pretty quiet for several months until Monday.

'It escalates and goes back down, it escalates and it goes back down,' she says. 'Usually, it's bad when it gets hot.'

Mystery: Officers have canvassed the area for witnesses but have yet to determine a motive or lead

Neighbor Ladawn Mack, a 25-year-old cashier, says she's used to seeing police cars in the street, and that Monday's quadruple homicide is enough to make her take extra precautions.

'We have a house alarm and I've always had a gun for my home,' Mack said.

Resident Alexis Draite, 20, recently moved to Tulsa from Oklahoma City, believing it to be safer.

Her strategy for staying alive: 'Lock the doors, lock the cars and don't stay outside longer than you need to.'

'The victims were shot multiple times,' Tulsa Police Officer Jillian Roberson toldÂ NBC News.

Police immediately began canvassing the area trying to find any witnesses to the crime, aside from the child who is believed to have been in the residence when the shooting occurred.

Anyone with information on the case can contact Crime Stoppers at 918-596-COPS.
