Many sleep experts blame using mobiles and tablets into the early hours for a bad night's sleep, but gadgets may not disrupt sleep at all – so long as you dim the lights and keep it at a safe distance from your face.

Recent research has shown that LED screen disrupts sleep because it stops the body producing the hormone melanin, which responds to light and govern whether we feel sleepy or not.

But the new study has found that simply lowering the brightness of a screen and holding the gadget about 12 inches away from the face can stop the light from interfering with a good night’s sleep.

Smartphones and other gadgets used before bed can cause restless nights because the light causes melatonin suppression - a chemical which controls the body clock

‘In the old days, people would go to bed and read a book. But much more commonly people go to bed and they have their tablet on which they read a book or they read a newspaper or they're looking at material.

'The problem is it's a lit device, and how problematic is the light source from the mobile device?’ co-author Dr. Lois Krahn, a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale in Arizona, told Medical Daily.

Last month Harvard academic and sleep expert Professor Charles Czeisler called for more research into the effects of artificial light after he published an article in journal Nature.

He said that modern humans are exposed to four times more light than 60 years ago and it was disrupting our sleep patterns.

He explained that the decline in the number of hours slept per night is affecting public health, including a greater risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression and stroke in adults and concentration problems in children.

Previous studies found that using a phone late at night prevents production of the sleep hormone melanin. Now experts say holding the phone close to your face could be the problem

The new study investigated how levels of light emitted from mobile devices at different distances from a user's face compared to the threshold of light that suppresses the secretion of melatonin, 30 lux.

In a dark room, they used a sensitive light meter to measure the light coming from two Apple tablets and a smartphone: an iPad 1, an iPad 3 with retinal display, and an iPhone 4.

The emitted light was measured at 0 inches and 14 inches from a user's face. 

Results
 showed that when the brightness was lowered to the minimal setting, the
 LED lights of all three devices were well below the 30 lux 
melatonin-suppressing threshold.

‘We found that only at the highest setting was the light over a conservative threshold that might affect melatonin levels,' said Dr. Krahn. 'If it's at the mid setting or at a low setting it's bright enough to use.’

Experts said some gadgets only need  the backlight dimmed while other devices such as the iPad 3 require a two-pronged approach to reduce light levels becoming too high

At the lowest brightness setting, held 
right up against a user's face, the iPhone 4's backlight measured only 2
 lux, the iPad 1 measured 11 lux, and the iPad 3 measured 2 lux.

Held 14 inches away from a user's face, all the devices measured between 0 and 3 lux at the lowest brightness setting.

At the brightest setting measured from the same distance from a user's face, the iPhone 4 measured 275 lux, the iPad 1 measured 124 lux, and the iPad 3 measured 248 lux — all far above the melatonin-disrupting limit.

When held 14 inches away at the brightest setting, the iPhone 4 measured 8 lux and the iPad 1 measured 21 lux. The iPad 3, however, measured 32 lux — just above the threshold.

The results suggest that if you must use your smartphone or tablet before bed, you should either keep the screen brightness at the lowest setting or hold it at least a foot from your face in order to avoid disrupting sleep.

If you have a mobile device with a particularly strong backlight, like the iPad 3, you should do both.

But by making simple adjustments you can still get a good night's sleep

Most phones just need dimming but certain gadgets such as the iPad 3 must be held at a distance, say the U.S. researchers
