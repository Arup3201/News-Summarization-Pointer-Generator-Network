Lawyers for two women accused of pummeling and kicking a 23-year-old woman who died after a fight outside a California nightclub have claimed that the dead woman was threw the first punch and their clients were acting in self-defense.

Candace Brito, 27, and Vanesa Zavala, 26, have pleaded not guilty in the death of Annie Hung Kim Pham, who was taken off life support after the fight outside the Santa Ana bar-restaurant in the early morning hours of Jan. 18.

The case drew enormous attention after Pham’s death, in part because the brawl that was captured by several bystanders on cellphone video that will provide key evidence in the case.

The women’s trial began on Wednesday and defense attorneys say Pham threw the first punch and their clients were acting in self-defense.

If convicted, they each face a maximum sentence of 15 years to life in state prison.

During opening arguments, Brito’s attorney, Michael Molfetta, told jurors that it was Pham’s own ‘poor decisions’ that led to her death.

‘She didn’t deserve to die, but the fact is she died because she took umbrage over a bump,’ Molfetta said.

Pham, who went by the first name Kim, graduated from Chapman University last year and would have celebrated her first wedding anniversary last month

Zavala’s attorney also said his client had been wrongly charged with murder and that she had a right to defend herself after being attacked by Pham.

Video of a brawl outside a Santa Ana nightclub that left a recent college graduate comatose was played repeatedly Wednesday

Kenneth Reed also predicted that jurors will ultimately be unable to determine which blow actually killed Pham during the chaotic scene outside the nightclub.

“She can’t tell you if it was one blow at the beginning, one blow that happened at the end or one blow that happened in the middle,” Reed said of the medical examiner’s expected testimony.

Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Troy Pino, though, said the two women deserve to be punished for Pham’s death.

A video was played at the start of the trial of Candace Brito and Vanesa Zavala on Wednesday morning which showed the jury cellphone footage of the melee

Pham's friends told police the three women in the other group attacked Pham without provocation after they bumped into her

Pino said that at one point Zavala, who was pushed away from the fight, returns to the scrum and deals a final blow to Pham before Pham fell to the pavement unconscious.

‘Let the criminal system do its job and find justice for the victim,’ Pino said.

During a preliminary hearing earlier this year, the forensic pathologist who conducted Pham's autopsy ruled the cause of death was blunt force injury to the head.

But she testified that it was impossible to tell whether one specific blow caused the fatal brain bleeding and swelling, or if it came from all the blows in combination.

Just who started the fight was in dispute during the hearing, with various witnesses describing different scenarios.

Pham was an aspiring writer whose work was published online and in an anthology of works by Vietnamese-American writers

Pham and her group of 11 friends were waiting in line to get into the club as Brito, Zavala, a woman identified as ‘Amelia’ and two men were exiting.

At some point, the groups bumped into each other.

Pham's friends told police the three women in the other group attacked Pham without provocation after they bumped into her.

Zavala told police that Pham's first swing hit her and the fight began.

Pham, who went by the first name Kim, graduated from Chapman University last year and would have celebrated her first wedding anniversary last month.

She was an aspiring writer whose work was published online and in an anthology of works by Vietnamese-American writers.
