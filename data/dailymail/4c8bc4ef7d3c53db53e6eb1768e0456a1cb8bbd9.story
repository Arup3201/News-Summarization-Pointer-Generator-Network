Its track winding through the grand surroundings of Old Quebec, this urban ice course exudes a magical, romantic quality.

The historic district of the Canadian city hosted the final stage of the Red Bull Crashed Ice World Championship at the weekend.

Drawing a crowd of some 100,000 enthusiastic sports fans, the event sees ice skaters propel themselves at terrifying speeds around a winding course containing a succession of obstacles.

Quebec is widely recognised as featuring the longest, 
fastest, and toughest track of the entire World Championship series.

And this year's course started with a bang, as the rounded start ramp 
launched the riders to intense speeds on CÃ´te de la Montagne, the city's oldest street.

They then faced tricky jumps and numerous obstacles including a step-up, a bridge, and sudden twists.

The course runs 584metres long, averages 4.5metres wide and contains 180-degree turns and a 50-degree incline

Saturday's event was won by Finnish competitor Aartu Pihlainen.

But local fans had much to cheer about as Kyle Croxall, 23, was crowned world champion, the first Canadian to win the title in the event's three-year history.

Croxall, of Mississauga, Ontario,
came second in Quebec on Saturday, but that position earned him enough 
overall points to claim the top spot in the world championship.

He said: 'After placing second overall two years 
in a row, I knew I had to dig deep and train every day no matter what if
I wanted to win, and lifting that World Championship trophy is 
absolutely worth it.'

Pihlainen came in a very close second
in the World Championship, amassing 2,960 points, and Kyle's younger 
brother Scott Croxall placed third with 2,300 points at the season's 
close.

Popular: Saturday's event saw 100,000 sports fans converge on the centre of Quebec

Although a relatively new sport, more
than 10,000 Canadians registered for the chance to compete in the 2012 
season at one of 13 qualifying events across the country.

From there, a random lottery 
selected 200 men and 20 women per qualifying city to tackle individual 
speed trials on a challenging flat-surface obstacle course filled with 
jumps, dives, and turns.

Fifty walk-up spots were also available at each event for determined athletes who had not been selected in the lottery.

To narrow the crop of athletes down 
to 100 men and 20 women, top participants from each qualifier who 
demonstrated the best skating skill, agility, speed, and strength earned
a spot at the main event in Quebec City.
