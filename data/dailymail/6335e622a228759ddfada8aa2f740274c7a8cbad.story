This is the dramatic moment a British man was arrested by French police on suspicion of the frenzied killing of a mother-of-three.

Robert Plant, 32, is being questioned about the murder of Joudia Zimmat, 34, who was attacked while out jogging.

She was sexually assaulted and stabbed so many times her face was ‘unrecognisable’, French police said. 

Arrest: Robert Plant, 32, is being questioned about the murder of Joudia Zimmat, 34, who was attacked while out jogging in a suburb of Nimes, in Provence

Odd-job: French police said they had arrested Plant, an odd-job man who moved to France aged ten and who lives with his mother in a luxury villa 300 yards from where the body was found

Brutal murder: The alarm was raised when jogger Joudia Zimmat, whose body was found lying next to a path in Courbessac, failed to arrive to pick her children up from school on Thursday

Her partly-clothed body was 
discovered in scrubland in a suburb of Nimes, in Provence, after she 
failed to pick up her children, aged three, six and nine, from school.

French police said they had arrested 
Plant, an odd-job man who moved to France aged ten and who lives with 
his mother in a luxury villa 300 yards from where the body was found.

The suspect was taken to his home in 
handcuffs yesterday morning as police carried out a five-hour search of 
the two-storey property, which has a gated drive and is set in 
landscaped grounds on a track in the outskirts of the city.

The body of ‘pretty and petite’ Miss 
Zimmat was discovered in a bramble bush at around 10pm on Thursday by a 
sniffer dog after her children’s school alerted her partner that she had
not collected them.

Questioning: The 32-year-old man, seen being driven away by police in France, has been arrested over the murder of a mother-of-three who was 'slaughtered' while she was out jogging

'Slaughtered': A craft knife and two blood-stained stones were recovered from the scene close to where Ms Zimmat's body was found in brambles

Investigation: Police in France have arrested a 32-year-old British man in connection with the 'pretty and petite' mother of three

Miss Zimmat, who was of Tunisian 
origin, regularly went running in the afternoon in Courbessac, a 
peaceful residential area of Nimes.

One police officer said: ‘The woman 
was murdered in cold blood. She had been cut and beaten with rocks. Her 
throat had been slit and her face was unrecognisable.’

A box cutter-type knife and two 
bloodstained stones were found near the body and there was evidence to 
suggest she had been sexually assaulted but not raped, officers said.

Police said Plant’s mother Esther was 
also arrested after allegedly providing a false alibi, claiming he had 
been at home with her at the time of the murder.

It later emerged she had been in Paris
visiting her daughter. She has been released and is not expected to be 
charged. Last night, no one was at the family’s villa.

Scene: The suspect, named as Robert Plant, 32, originally from Chatham, Kent, has been detained for questioning

Nimes: Police said the victim's clothes had been torn from her body and she had been sexually assaulted

Plant moved to Paris aged about ten 
when his father Dennis got a ‘very good’ job with a French 
telecommunications firm, his uncle David Ripley, of Dartford, Kent, said
last night.

He said Plant was ‘more French than 
British’. Plant’s father, who was half-French, died of lung cancer last 
year, shortly after he retired. Mrs Plant was believed to have been 
considering returning to Kent to be closer to her family.

Yesterday, Plant was described by locals as a ‘well-educated, very pleasant loner’ who ‘never had a bad word for anyone’.

A neighbour described him as a ‘tall, clean-cut, pleasant young man who was often strolling around with his pet dog’.

Miss Zimmat is the third woman jogger 
killed in France since June 2011 but police have not established any 
link with the other murders.

Quiet suburb: The British suspect is thought to have living in Nimes with his parents for several months

Sources: One police officer in France said the victim had been so savagely attacked her face was unrecognisable
