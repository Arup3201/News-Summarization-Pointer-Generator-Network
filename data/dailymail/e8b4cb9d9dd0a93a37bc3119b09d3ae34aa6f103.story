The double-dip recession is fuelling the rapid growth of cheating websites, as thousands of unhappy spouses say they are unable to afford separation.

Since the UK's economic situation hit new lows this April, there has been an influx of married couples seeking extra-marital affairs via the internet.

Experts believe that divorce, which costs around £13,000, is behind the shift towards wide-spread infidelity.

The poor economy has  boosted cheating websites as unhappy spouses say they are unable to afford divorce

Leading married dating site IllicitEncounters.com claims that since the economy worsened they have welcomed 27,000 new members - a 
200 per cent increase on the previous year.

Many stated on 
their application that they were joining because they were unable to get out of 
unhappy relationships due to their financial situation.

Cheating consultant Rosie Freeman-Jones said: 'Many couples are now finding themselves trapped in
 unhappy marriages because they simply can not afford to divorce.'

And while the legal fees might pose a problem the stagnant housing market and emergence of family debt  - up 58 per cent to an average of £9,314 per household  - have also impacted.

She added: 'It’s 
the fact that they can’t sell their houses since the market is so 
stagnant. Worse, some are in a position of negative equity.

'A surprisingly high number of people who have recently joined have said that they count their marriages as over already and would have already got a divorce by now if they could only afford it. 

'Having an affair is treated almost as a practical, rather than a romantic, decision.'

The pursuit of sexual excitement, boredom with marriage and the need of an ego boost were other reasons men gave for cheating, according to he UK Adultery Survey 2012 by undercoverlovers.com.

Meanwhile women were more likely to be seeking emotional fulfilment, an improvement to their self esteem and lasting romance.

It also found female adulterers are also far more prone to falling in love with their affair partner than their male equivalents.

IllicitEncounters.com boasts around 670,000 members, more than 3 per cent of the UK's married population.

Camilla, 35 from Hertfordshire, who has been a member of  IllicitEncounters.com since early May 2012, says:

'Our marriage is effectively over but
 we don’t have any choice but to live to together.  Neither of us can 
afford to move out and rent a place, but neither can we afford to 
divorce and sell the house.

'Work is pretty tough at the moment 
with everyone thinking they might be made redundant at any time, so I 
joined up the site to meet men in a similar situation as myself.  I’ve 
got to say, it’s been a huge stress reliever - though I’ve only met a 
few people for coffee.

'I don’t feel I’m ready to launch into
 anything right now so this suits me for the time being, and at least 
both people know exactly what the score is. 

'My marriage has slowly 
become a relationship of convenience, and with the daily flow of overdue
 bills and long working hours it’s nice to have something to look 
forward to - even if it is with someone other than my husband.'
