Jumping for joy, these prized pooches have been captured on camera as they leap through the air in a stunning series of photographs.

From Charlie the dalmatian play fighting with Enzi the Rhodesian ridgeback, to Belle the Kung Fu-kicking boxer these pictures show the comedic results of freeze-framing man's best friends in mid-air.

Other images show Sid the Jack Russell playing Frisbee on Brighton beach and Albert the lurcher dramatically leaping over a snow-banked stream in Oxfordshire.

In suspense: Arty the Jack Russell leaps through the air in this dramatic shot by pet photographer Rhian White

The pictures were taken by specialist dog photographer Rhian White, 35, who has perfected the art of capturing our loyal companions over the past five years.

Ms White explained how she captured the amusing moment that her mother's lurcher, Albert, became over-excited during a shoot.

'Albert was curious about a female dog that he saw on the other side of the stream,' she said.

'Albert is not especially in to leaping per say, just as and when it's more convenient to do so. There
 was a bridge about two-feet-away, but clearly that was too far to go 
for Albert who was determined to meet this other dog.

'Without giving it a second thought he jumped over in one flying leap. Sadly for Albert the female in question was not so keen.'

Ms White does not only take pictures 
of action-packed jumping shots, but also portraits and the intimate 
moments between dog and owner.

The
 dog photographer, from Brighton in East Sussex, spends an average of an
 hour with her client's dogs and presents at least 30-shots of the 
pooches in action.

She also has plans to produce short films of dogs in future.

'When I'm doing a photo-shoot of a dog jumping I generally take multiple shots of the action,' said Ms White.

'I don't normally use every shot in a sequence.

'Instead I pick and choose the best ones and then use Photoshop to add them all together.

'If you want to do it well it can take a long time.

'Short-haired dogs are easier to do than long-haired dogs.'

Ms White explained how she was able to capture these candid moments of dogs at their jumping best.

'I was encouraging them to play and to have fun and a lot of them are just naturally jumpy,' she said.

'For some of the shots I am far away and the owner is holding something in the air that they are jumping towards.

'In others I have a wide-angle lens that lets me take photos of them pretty close up.

'Normally I hold the camera with my right hand and throw things in the air with my left.

'Often it is hit and miss, but you can get some really interesting angles with this method.'

However, taking such close-up shots of boisterous dogs can be a challenge, and Ms White had to be prepared to be in the thick of the rough and tumble.

'When taking shots like this it's not unusual to get landed on by the dog," she said.

'They don't mean to of course.

'If you're in the water it can get pretty wet - not that the dogs care.

'They are normally far too engrossed in getting the ball or stick.'
