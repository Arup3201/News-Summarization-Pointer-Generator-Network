The Today show stirred up its own controversy Wednesday morning while discussing the fake sign language interpreter who managed to make it into the Nelson Mandela memorial.

As hosts of the show's 9 o'clock hour showed footage of the fraud translating a memorial speech into gibberish, someone thought it would be funny to show their own fake translation.

A man who appeared to be a producer showed up in a small circle on the screen and smirked as he pretended to use sign language.

Not funny: The Today show tried to poke fun at the news that a fraudulent sign language interpreter made it into the Mandela memorial, but it failed to be funny

Is this for real? As the brief gag played out on live TV, even the hosts were shocked. At right, Willie Geist appears flummoxed as he squints toward his monitor

'That's horrific': Just after the brief but offensive gag aired live, Today co-host Natalie Morales called something 'horrific,' though it wasn't clear if she was referring to her show's joke or the fraudulent interpreter

The joke lasted for only a moment, but it was broadcast live and long enough for anyone to clearly see.

The tasteless gag elicited an apology tweet from Today almost immediately.

'We aired a joke in our 9:00 hour that was offensive. We apologize to our viewers,' read the tweet, which was sent around 9:50AM.

Even the hosts weren't sure what to make of it.

'That is horrific,' said Natalie Morales, though it wasn't clear if she was referring to the thoughtless joke or the fraudulent interpreter.

Only one laughing: The jokester, who looked to be a producer, smirked as he did his own fraudulent sign language interpretation--but no one else was laughing

Total hoax: Three sign language experts said the man was not signing in South African or American sign languages, he was simply 'flapping his arms about'

The discussion continued to focus on the translator briefly, before quickly moving on to other news.

The unidentified man was simply making up his own signs, according to the Deaf Federation of South Africa.

Three sign language experts said the man was not signing in South African or American sign languages.

Delphin
 Hlungwane, an official South African sign language interpreter with 
DeafSA, said authorities were trying to track the man down.

She said: 'There was zero percent accuracy. He couldn't even get the basics right. He couldn't even say thank you.

'You're
 supposed to indicate with your facial expressions, even if it's not an 
exact sign. He didn't indicate that (booing of Jacob Zuma) at all. It 
just passed him by.

'Nobody knows who he is. Even at this hour we still don't have his name.'

Groan: (from R to L) Al Roker, Willie Geist, and Natalie Morales share a collective groan as the gag unexpectedly appears live on Wednesday's 9am hour of Today

Presidential fake-out: The fake interpreter even stood beside President Obama and pretended to translate the tribute he gave to a man he's called his hero
