Manchester United look like they could have done with a defender like Thomas Vermaelen - instead, he was house hunting in Barcelona.

Vermaelen, who signed for Barca for £15million earlier in the summer despite interest from Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford, was looking for somewhere to live with his British-born girlfriend, TV presenter Polly Parsons.

When he arrived at the Nou Camp, the Belgium defender said: 'This is one of the biggest clubs in the world so it was not a difficult decision to make. Everyone wants to play here and I’m not an exception.'

Vermaelen's ambition to be a regular starter for Barcelona may end up being more of a pipe dream if Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo are to be believed.

Last week they picked their ideal Barca XI - and there was no place for Vermaelen. Instead, Gerard Pique was partnered at centre half by Jeremy Mathieu, with Jordi Alba at left back.

A few home truths, then, for the former Arsenal captain as he looks for a house in Catalonia.
