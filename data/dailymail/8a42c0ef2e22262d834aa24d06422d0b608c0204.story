Retail giant Target faces at least five lawsuits related to the massive credit and debit card breach revealed last week.

The suits are seeking damages for the roughly 40million credit and debit card accounts that were compromised by hackers. Four states have also asked Target for information while they continue to investigate the lapse.

The lawsuits have been filed in California, Minnesota and Oregon, and the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and South Dakota have asked for further information.

On notice: Target faces at least five lawsuits across three states for the data breach

At least two lawsuits have been filed in California, two in Minnesota and one in Oregon, CBS News said, citing multiple reports.

More than one is seeing class action status, and at least one is seeking compensation in the millions of dollars.

The attorneys general of four separate states seeking more information about the coordinated attack is only the first step in what may become a multi-state investigation, according to USA Today.

Target’s sales have suffered in the aftermath of the attack, which occurred between November 27 and December 15.

Transactions are down as much as four per cent, according to an analyst who spoke with the Wall Street Journal. Figures at other retailers remained strong.

Target declined to comment to MailOnline on this weekend's sales figures. A spokesperson said via email that the retailer on reports such information on a quarterly basis.

The chain announced in a statement Monday afternoon that a conference call will be held with the attorneys general of the states requesting more information in order to better coordinate how to respond going forward.

It is also working closely with the Secret Service and the Department of Justice in their ongoing efforts to determine how exactly the identity theft happened.

Reports of the lawsuits come as security expert Brian Krebs wrote in his blog that he is seeing credit and debit card information stolen from Target selling on the black market.

‘[They are] selling in batches of one million cards and going for anywhere from $20 to more than $100 per card.’

JP Morgan Chase took the unprecedented step of limiting customers affected by the Target breach to cash withdrawals of only $100 and purchases of only $300 – on the weekend before Christmas.

‘This is the worst possible time something like this could happen,’ Craig Johnson, president of Consumer Growth Partners, told the Journal.

A shopper told CBS News the troubles forced him to avoid using cards.

‘I actually used cash today specifically because I heard about this and I didn't want to risk using my card.’

The retailer also tried enticing shoppers by discounting final purchase prices 10 per cent in all stores.
