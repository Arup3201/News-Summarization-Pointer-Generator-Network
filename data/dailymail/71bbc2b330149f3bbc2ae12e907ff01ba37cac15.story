Huntsman spiders are a breed of arachnids notorious for their formidable size and speed.

One would hope this would keep people from invading their personal space, but footage has surfaced of one man pushing the envelope too far and sending the spider into a flying rage.

The spine-tingling vision shows the imprudent man, listed as Kaleb Lechowski, repeatedly stirring the long-legged spider.

The huntsman attempts to escape before losing its cool and leaping  onto Kaleb's hand, much to his horror. 

The video, titled ‘Spider Decides He's Had Enough Of Humans,’ was uploaded to YouTube on Sunday

The video, titled ‘Spider Decides He's Had Enough Of Humans,’ was uploaded to YouTube on Sunday by Jukin Video, a prominent viral video channel. It has since garnered over 50,000 views. 

The description lists the video as being taken on a warm day in Australia. 

Once it decides to attack the spider can be seen moving with explosive speed, bounding onto Kaleb like a tiger pouncing onto its prey.

Huntsmen are known for their agility, having the ability to cover a yard a second.

While they do bite their venom is not considered high risk to humans, however the larger specimens can still inflict a painful sting.
