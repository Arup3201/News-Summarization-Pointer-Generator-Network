As the dust settled in the ruins of her 11th floor office in Oslo after the devastating bomb blast, Line Nersnaes knew she had to get out.

But while the 50-year-old Justice Department advisor realised she had to struggle through the shattered glass and twisted metal to make her escape, she had no idea a 12-inch wooden spike had lodged in her head.

The spear-like fragment from a 
shattered wooden window frame had narrowly missed her brain, having 
entered under her chin and exiting at the top of her skull.

It was not until she could no longer ignore the pain of a piercing headache that she started to wonder what had happened to her.

Meanwhile, the man who confessed to the bombing and youth camp shooting spree on Utoya island is facing his second interrogation since the massacre, as the nation mourns the 76 victims in memorial services.

Norwegian news agency NTB says Anders Breivik was picked up at a jail and transported to police headquarters in Oslo for a second session of questioning.

Breivik was questioned for seven hours on Saturday, the day after the atrocities.

Back at work today, a week after being at the centre of Norway’s worst 
terrorist bombing, Ms Nersnaes has described her terror as it became 
clear how close she had come to dying.

She said: ‘I was at my desk when I heard this violent blast – a massive shock wave filled the whole room.

‘The glass in the window is laminated
so it did not shatter but the whole window frame splintered and came 
towards me and I was hit in the head.

‘I
found myself sitting with my back to the wall 10 feet away from where I
had been. I had a terrible headache but I couldn’t understand why.

‘At that time I did not know that this wooden spike had drilled into my head through my chin.

‘Everyone who survived understood that we had to get out of the building as fast as possible.

‘There
was broken glass everywhere. Broken cups and glasses littered the 
kitchen outside my office. The dishwasher had been ripped apart.

‘It was grey and quiet. I had been deafened by the blast.

‘I
met my boss, Knut Fosli, in the hallway and we walked down the fire 
escape together to safety. The main stone staircase was twisted and 
broken.

‘I told Knut that I had this terrible headache.

‘He looked at me and said, “You’ve got something sticking out of your head”.’

Everyone around her looked and saw a 12-inch wooden spike had was sticking through her head.

Out in the street Ms Nersnaes could feel she was bleeding a lot. She said: ‘It felt like my head had been torn apart.

‘I put my hand on my head and I felt a stick sticking straight out. I got so terrified when I realised that I had something in my head. But I was lucky to be alive.

‘The centre of Oslo was like a war zone. People were lying face-down.’

Ms Nersnaes was taken to casualty with other blast victims.

Soon after, hospital staff started shouting that many more wounded were arrived from the massacre on Utoya island.

Amazingly,
the civil servant had suffered only superficial injuries and after 
doctors gave her 27 stitches and tightly bandaged her head she was 
released home at 8.30 that night.

Security guards revealed yesterday 
that they had decided not to challenge Anders Behring Breivik when he 
parked the Volkswagen Crafter van directly outside Norway’s equivalent 
of 10 Downing Street two minutes earlier because he had been wearing a 
police uniform.

Ms Nersnaes is now back at work. She does not have a computer and works at a school desk with paper and pen.

But she is determined that the 
government white paper on domestic violence she was working on when the 
bomb went off will be completed.

She said: ‘I think it will be 
difficult to make my August 10 deadline but I promise I will have the 
document on domestic violence ready before Christmas.’

Last night it emerged that the moment
Anders Behring Breivik was arrested on Utoya island, police found him 
waiting for them in a clearing.

He had his hands on his head in a gesture of surrender while his loaded weapons were 30 yards away.

The most reviled man in Norway told the Delta squad armed response team: ‘‘I am finished now.’
