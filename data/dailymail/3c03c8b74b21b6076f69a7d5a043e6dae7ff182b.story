An attorney for a former Marine found guilty in the shooting deaths of American Sniper author Chris Kyle and another man has filed an appeal.

Eddie Ray Routh was convicted of capital murder in the 2013 deaths of Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a rural shooting range, after jurors rejected his insanity defense. 

Prosecutors hadn't sought the death penalty, so Routh was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Routh's attorneys said after the February 24 verdict they would appeal.

J. Warren St. John, one of Routh's attorneys, said the notice of appeal was filed on Tuesday. 

St. John also filed a motion for a new trial, arguing the conviction and sentence were contrary to law and evidence.

The case drew extra attention due to the film based on Kyle's memoir.

Routh, 27, was emotionless as the jury read their verdict on Tuesday night: that he had not been insane when he opened fire on Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield in February 2013. 

They had taken him to a shooting range to help him settle back into society after he left the Marines.

After the verdict, Littlefield's brother-in-law, Jerry Richardson, turned to Routh and said: 'You took the lives of two heroes, men that tried to be a friend to you. You became an American disgrace.'

As the Littlefield family also spoke out on the Today show on Wednesday morning, jurors stepped forward to say they had 'no doubt' that Routh knew what he was doing at the time of the murders.

The verdict came as interest in Kyle's career as the U.S. military's deadliest-ever sniper reached fever pitch thanks to Oscar-nominated film about his life, 'American Sniper'. 

Ahead of the trial, Routh's lawyers had argued that the popularity of the movie, which grossed $300 million at the box office, would mean he could not get a fair trial.

And speaking on Good Morning America on Wednesday, the jurors admitted some of them had seen the movie - but insisted they had put that out of their minds when making their decision.

'It gave me a better outlook on Chris' role as a Marine,' one of the jurors, Barrett Hutchinson, said. 'But as far as the actions that took place on February 2, Chad was still in the picture and Chad was not in that movie.

'I took the fact that Chris was a marine out of my mind and looked at him as a person, looked at Chad as a person, looked at Eddie as a person and, you know, tried to make reasonable judgment.' 

An attorney representing Chris Kyle's wife is arguing that a judge was mistaken in awarding a $1.8 million defamation verdict to former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura over the way he was portrayed in the book American Sniper.

In a brief filed Wednesday in the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Taya Kyle's lawyer wrote that the verdict should be reversed and the court should rule in Kyle's favor. 

At minimum, attorney John Borger wrote, Kyle should be granted a new trial.

Ventura, a former pro wrestler and former Minnesota governor, sued Chris Kyle for defamation in 2012 after the best-selling author wrote in his book that he decked Ventura at a California bar because the former governor made offensive comments about SEALs. 

Ventura testified that he never made the statements and that the confrontation never happened.

A federal jury sided with Ventura last summer, awarding him $500,000 for damages and recommending $1.3 million for 'unjust enrichment,' or how much money Kyle improperly made from the claim. U.S. District Judge Richard Kyle granted the unjust enrichment, finding it was 'reasonable and supported by a preponderance of the evidence.'

But Borger argued on appeal that the unjust enrichment award based on alleged defamatory speech is unprecedented and violates the First Amendment. Borger also argued that Ventura didn't prove the account was either 'material falsity' or 'actual malice,' and as a result, he didn't meet the legal threshold for a defamation claim.

Borger said the judge also erred in giving instructions to the jury.

'A properly instructed jury would not have rendered a verdict in Ventura's favor,' Borger wrote.

Kyle, a former SEAL regarded as the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, was killed in 2013 at a Texas shooting range. A former Marine was convicted in his death last month.

Caught: Routh is pictured in the back of a police car after he fled the scene of the murder in Kyle's truck before he was eventually caught. He claimed he shot the two men because he feared they would kill him

Confession: Routh, pictured hours after the killings, confessed to the shootings almost immediately

Also on Wednesday, Chad Littlefield's family spoke out about the verdict.

'It was an answered prayer,' Judy Littlefield told the Today show. 'We've waited a long time to hear that. We feel justice has been served.'

Routh's brother-in-law added that he never once believed Routh had been insane. Routh's attorneys had tried to prove he was in a psychotic state at the time of the killings.

'It was all an act,' Jerry Richardson said. 'I taught him in high school and... that's just the way he was. He never grew up. He was still just opposite defiant, and he had nothing wrong in the mind except for the drug use.'

Chad's father Don remembered his son as a 'quiet man' and 'a good listener' who met Kyle at their children's soccer practices.

The two men shared an interest in working out and helping veterans, Don said. Chad himself was not a veteran but wanted to help others.

'Chris served overseas and Chad served when they came back,' Mrs Littlefield explained.

Mr Littlefield added: 'His motto was pass it forward.'  

Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, testified in the trial but has not spoken out since the verdict. She was seen in the courtroom on Tuesday but did not return when the decision was read.
