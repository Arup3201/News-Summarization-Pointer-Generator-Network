The first thing you need to know about Jose Mourinho is just how much he loves winning football matches.

It is everything to him — whether it is the Barclays Premier League, the Champions League or a charity match. Last summer, Jose was in charge of the Rest of the World for Soccer Aid, I was playing for Sam Allardyce’s England side and Mourinho’s team were leading at Old Trafford going into the final moments.

To ensure the advantage was preserved, however, Mourinho — with a glint in his eye — had a word with James McAvoy, the Hollywood actor, who he was putting on as substitute. Not long after, James had gone to ground with an ‘injury’ to help run the clock down. The job was done and they won 4-2!

I must stress that it was all good-natured, but on Wednesday night against Paris Saint-Germain, the actions of a Mourinho team were significantly darker. I called Chelsea’s behaviour disgraceful and sad as they pursued a Champions League quarter-final place.

They went beyond what is acceptable but, unfortunately, it is not the first time we have seen them do it. I doubt it will be the last, either.

Mourinho and his teams take winning to a level that other teams and managers do not.

Respect for Mourinho’s achievements in the game is beyond doubt. In a few years from now, we could be acknowledging him as the most successful manager of all time, particularly if he keeps picking up a trophy every 35 matches, as is his current remarkable ratio.

But will he be loved? Chelsea fans undoubtedly adore him. Porto and Inter supporters will too. Yet beyond that? It is debatable.

Will he care how he is remembered? I think he will. Deep down, I think everyone in football cares how they are perceived.

Are trophies more important than creating good memories? I would always argue ‘yes’ to that. During my career, I won 10 major honours but none of the Liverpool teams I played for is particularly remembered for being a top side.

If I’m honest, it annoys me, especially when I hear stories even now of how great Kevin Keegan’s Newcastle team of 1995-96 were or how thrilling the Leeds team were that reached the Champions League semi-final in 2000. Yes, they both played fast, exciting football but what did they win? Nothing.

You want to be successful and have a reputation that spans a lifetime, like the Real Madrid team of the 1950s that Alfredo di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas inspired to five consecutive European Cups or the Ajax team of Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff from the 1970s.

They took that style on to the Dutch national squad. Cruyff once said, ‘how you play is more important than what you win’ and to some extent, he is right. The Holland side from the 1974 World Cup, for instance, get spoken about more than the West German squad that actually won it.

Personally, I would have rather been a German than in the Dutch squad that came up short. The same goes for Brazil in 1982, the other great team that captured hearts but failed to conquer the world.

I know most of the names of that great squad, as I am sure many do — Zico, Eder, Falcao, Socrates — but what would those men rather have, a winner’s medal — like their compatriots in 1970 — or just the knowledge that everyone loved the football they played?

In an ideal world, you get remembered for winning with style. The best example I have of that from my childhood was the AC Milan team of Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten that was guided by Arrigo Sacchi in the late 1980s. Their quality in that period was beyond compare and they remain the last side to retain the European Cup.

Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona, however, are the team that took style and success to another level all together. They will still be writing books about them in 50 years, such was the swagger with which they won 14 trophies in four extraordinary years.

When a team wins silverware with imagination and fantasy, it almost seems more special.

Mourinho is just as prolific at collecting trophies as Guardiola but the brand of football his team play does not compare. That is why, in the long-term, you won’t find his teams spoken about like some of the others I have mentioned.

The behaviour of the teams, of course, doesn’t help either. Chelsea have been likened to the Leeds team from the 1970s but I actually think the way they conducted themselves was worse during Mourinho’s first spell in England. They were prepared to push it further still.

None of that might bother Mourinho, in the same way it didn’t bother Rafa Benitez. I remember him once telling me about a conversation he had with a Spanish journalist, about what was perceived as ‘great football’ and ‘winning football’.

Rafa was puzzled by this, so he asked the journalist: ‘Who scored Spain’s winning goal in the 1964 European Championship?’

The reply came: ‘Marcelino’. So Rafa then asked, ‘And how did Spain play in the game?’ to which there was silence.

His point was all that mattered was Spain had won the trophy. Mourinho would clearly understand the logic in that argument.

I can see what he means, too. But the idea of winning at all costs? That is something with which I am not comfortable.

I loved winning, there was nothing better that you could experience in football. But when all is said and done, you want to be remembered and respected for what you achieved.

And if Mourinho’s teams keep taking things to the brink, the love his achievements should secure is unlikely to ever come.

Hughes revival will put big clubs on alert

There is a big game in the Midlands with West Bromwich Albion coming up against Stoke.

Praise for the work of Albion’s Tony Pulis, the former Stoke boss, shows no sign of dwindling, particularly after he was named manager of the month for February.

West Brom are thriving under his guidance and there is little doubt they will be in the Barclays Premier League next season.

But what about Mark Hughes, the man who succeeded Pulis at Stoke?

Mark Hughes (right) has flown under the radar but has led the Potters to eighth in the Premier League

Without grabbing any headlines, Hughes has impressively manoeuvred Stoke into eighth place in the Premier League and they have built on their efforts of last season. They spent just £1.2million last summer, and lost Bojan Krkic to a serious knee injury, but they continue to get good results. Only Liverpool and Arsenal have picked up more points since Boxing Day.

The work Hughes has done at the Britannia Stadium seems to have gone under the radar. His journey since he was sacked in a poor manner by Manchester City in December 2009 hasn’t always been smooth.

For instance, he was criticised for the way he left Fulham in 2011 and was then sacked by Queens Park Rangers after spending less than a year at Loftus Road, even though he kept them in the top flight in May 2012. But he has rebuilt his reputation in the Potteries and looks like he will be rewarded with a new contract.

If he continues to make such impressive strides, he may get the chance once again to work at a club that can regularly compete for top honours.

This week I'm looking forward to... Seeing if Everton can keep flying the flag in Europe

Another disappointing week in Europe for teams from the Barclays Premier League but, once again, Everton proved an exception to the rule.

The last hour of their clash with Dynamo Kiev saw Everton playing at their best under Roberto Martinez — the football was good, the energy was high and there was an intensity in everything they did. It all helped to show how difficult Romelu Lukaku  can be to play against in that mood.

He bulldozed his way past a number of challenges to set up Steven Naismith’s goal, showed character to take the crucial penalty and bullied Dynamo’s defenders, including the highly-rated Aleksandar Dragovic. He now has 16 goals for the season.

Lukaku's penalty was not convincing, but it hands Everton the upper hand in the tie ahead of the return leg

When you see Everton play like that, you wonder why they have struggled in the Premier League.

But if they replicate the performance that gave them a 2-1 lead to take to Kiev, they will have an outstanding chance of beating Newcastle for just their second league win of 2015.

As soon as Everton start getting points on the board again, the tense atmosphere around Goodison Park will relax and Evertonians will be able to enjoy the European adventure a little bit more.
