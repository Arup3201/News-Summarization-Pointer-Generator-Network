She missed out on a nomination for Sexiest Female at this year's British Soap Awards.

However, it looks like Jennifer Metcalfe was certainly showing awards bosses and the public they may have missed a trick by leaving her off the shortlist.

The Hollyoaks star, 29, certainly garnered plenty of attention as she arrived at the Manchester ceremony in a white Roberto Cavalli blazer and nothing underneath.

Scroll down for video and a list of winners

Taking the plunge: Hollyoaks actress Jennifer Metcalfe shows off some major cleavage in a white blazer and skinny jeans at the British Soap Awards in Manchester on Saturday

Too much? Jennifer shows off her breasts as the material gapes open

As she bent over, the gaping blazer nearly exposed Jennifer's breasts to the waiting paparazzi.

Joining Jennifer on the red carpet was her co-star Gemma Merna, who plays her on-screen sister Carmel in the Channel 4 soap.

Ahead of her red carpet arrival, Jennifer had been tweeting about her pampering and cocktail sessions.

She's got some front! After three cocktails, no wonder Jennifer was relaxed in her risque ensemble

No clashes tonight: Jennifer may have been relieved to hear her former love rival Samia Ghadie wouldn't be attending

Sibling style: While Jennifer went for sexy androgynous, her co-star Gemma Merna went for a daring lace number

Just before she turned up at Media City in Salford, she admitted she was on her third cocktail.

She tweeted: 'Cocktail no 3 now 'av t get ready (sic).'

Rather interestingly, her former love rival Samia Ghadie, who plays Maria Connor in Coronation St, chose to stay at home. 

VERY daring! Gemma, who plays Carmel Valentine, wore a daring black lace gown... and appeared to have no underwear underneath

Catch up: Jennifer and Gemma talk to their co-stars on the red carpet

Grecian goddess: Jorgie Porter, who is up for Sexiest Female, showed some flesh in white Grecian gown and gold belt

Baby on board: Former Coronation Street actress Lucy-Jo Hudson, who was there to support her husband, showed off her baby bump in white

Proud: Lucy-Jo looked delighted as she posed alongside her nominated husband Alan Halsall

Samia started dating Jennifer's 
ex-boyfriend Sylvain Longchambon in January, soon after he ended his two
year romance with the latter.

Blonde Gemma also went for a more daring look, in a floor-length lace gown with a sheer panel all down the side.

No doubt the actress would have done some serious waxing before opting for such a revealing ensemble.

Bit more restrained: Corrie star Brooke Vincent wore a white trouser suit... and probably a bra (unlike Jennifer)

Old school Hollywood glamour: Sexiest Female nominee Natalie Anderson wore a low-cut white halterneck dress

Ahead of making her entrance in the daring gown, she wrote: '#Blackonblackonblack !!!'

Also going for a similar style to Jennifer was Coronation Street star Brooke Vincent, who wore a white trouser suit.

White appeared to be a dominant colour 
on the red carpet with Sexiest Female nominee Natalie Anderson - who 
plays Alicia Metcalfe in Emmerdale - also opting for a low-cut white 
gown.

Making a statement: Villain Of The Year nominee Natalie Gumede (left) wore a red patterned shift dress, while Sexiest Female nominee Georgia May Foote sizzled in red floor-length

Golden girl: Coronation Street star Kym Lomas was going for a Bond girl look in a gold gown with plunging back

Mother-to-be and former Corrie star 
Lucy-Jo Hudson showed off her bump in a flowing white gown as she 
arrived to support her husband Alan Halsall.

The
Corrie star, who plays Tyrone Dobbs, is up for Best Actor, Best 
Storyline, Best Single Episode and Best On-Screen Partnership with 
co-star Jennie McAlpine.

His former co-star Natalie Gumede, who 
played Tyrone's abusive wife Kirsty, is up for Best Villain, Best 
Dramatic Performance, Best Single Episode and Best Storyline. 

Pretty in pink: Sexiest Female nominee Michelle Keegan arrived with boyfriend Mark Wright

Natalie opted for a more colourful ensemble in a red patterned shift dress with a pair of matching killer heels.

Her co-star Georgia May Foote, who plays teen mum Katy Armstrong, also opted for the same colour, but a floor-length gown.

Also representing Corrie in the glamour stakes was Kym Lomas, who went for a Bond girl style in a gold shimmering dress with plunging back by Nadine Merabi.

Blonde on black: (L-R) EastEnders actresses Hetti Bywater (Lucy Beale) and Danielle Harold (Lola Pearce)

Red carpet: EastEnders actress Shona McGarty looked dramatic in black and gold, while co-star Jo Joyner kept it simple in a LBD

Meanwhile, her co-star Michelle Keegan went for more understated glamour in a pretty pink column dress by Rachel Gilbert which she teamed with Matthew Campbell Laurenza jewellery.

The
brunette beauty, who is up for Sexiest Female and Best Actress, arrived
on the arm of her boyfriend, former the Only Way Is Essex star Mark 
Wright.

When it came to the EastEnders cast, it appeared black for a popular shade for castmembers young and old.

Interesting choice: Jessie Wallace opted for an off the shoulder top with a draped skirt

Keeping it cool: Jessie's boyfriend Tim Arnold decided to keep his shades on as he posed on the red carpet

Sheer delight: Emmerdale actress Lucy Pargeter, who plays Chastity, also opted for sheer panelling

Hollyoaks hotties: Stephanie Waring (L) and Stephanie Davis wore contrasting black and white gowns

Back beauty: Nikki Sanderson showed off her back in her shimmering backless gown

Long and short: Katie McGylnn (R) showed off her figure in a little white dress while Emmerdale's Fiona Wade (L) oozed glamour

Hetti Bywater, who plays bad girl Lucy Beale, wore a black dress with sheer panels and a belt which cinched in her tiny waist.

Her fellow blonde co-star Danielle Harold, who plays teen mum Lola Pearce, wore a strapless mermaid gown.

Fellow young EastEnder Shona McGarty wore a dramatic black and gown creation with long train.

Still shinning: Shobna Gulati, dressed in Kirsty Doyle, (L) who has now left Corrie joined co-star Jennie McAlpine at the event

In the pink: Former Coronation Street actress Tina O'Brien wore a pale pink sequinned gown and feathered skirt

Suited and booted: Coronation streets Antony Cotton (L) and John Michie (R) made sure they looked dapper in their black suits

Effort: Debbie Rush, who plays Anna Windass on Coronation Street and co-star Mikey North made an effort with their looks

Contrasting looks: EastEnders: Diane Parish opted for a dress with a thigh split, while Jamie Forman went for a simple suit

Careful: Shane Richie forgot to do up his laces as he posed with wife Christie Goddard

Meanwhile, their co-star Jo Joyner kept it simple in a little black dress and beige platform heels.

Leading the stars in pinks and nudes were former Coronation Street actress Tina O'Brien, who looked lovely in a pale pink sequinned gown with feathered detail by Nadine Merabi.

Hollyoaks star Anna Shaffer, who plays Ruby Button, also opted for a similar shade in a silk number.

Strictly Come Dancing professional Ola Jordan looked pretty in pink in a strapless prom dress and silver high heels.

The British Soap Awards, hosted by Phillip Schofield, will air on Sunday May 19 at 8pm on ITV.
