A dog belonging to a California firefighter who disappeared during a backpacking trip has been rescued after nine days in the wilderness, but his owner remains missing.

Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said Sunday that a rescue effort for Mike Herdman will be scaled back after days of searching the Los Padres National Forest.

The dog, named Duke, was found Sunday in the parking lot where Herdman had parked his car.

Herdman and a friend were backpacking June 13 when the dog ran off and the 36-year-old Herdman chased after the pet barefoot and wearing only shorts.

Search crews have put in nearly 5,000 hours and scoured 50 square miles on foot, horseback and by air.

The dog had been spotted twice before but had eluded capture.

Good
 Samaritans found Duke around noon in a parking lot Sunday where the 
missing person's vehicle had been parked, said Sgt. Kevin Donoghue of 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Office.

Herdman went missing June 13 while looking for his dog after the animal ran off from the campsite, according to the Whittier Daily News. Herdman is a paramedic with the Arcadia Fire Department.

Co-worker
 Taylor Byars, who was also on the trip, unsuccessfully looked for him 
before he left the park and was able to contact authorities two days 
later, the paper said.

Ventura
 County Sheriff's Captain Luis Obregon told the Daily News last week an 
air crew was used to search for Herdman as well as volunteers on 
horseback.

Herdman is 'an elite athlete and family man who planned to be home on Father's Day,' NBC Los Angeles reported. Herdman went missing while only wearing a T-shirt and a pair of shorts, his companion told authorities.

'He's in incredible shape,' Sgt. Eric Buschow said of the firefighter.

'But even with experience in the back country, if you don't have the right clothing and you don't have the right gear, it can be a tough situation to get out of.'
