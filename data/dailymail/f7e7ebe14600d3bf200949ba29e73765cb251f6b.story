Facebook conducted an experiment among nearly 700,000 users to gauge how posts on the site affect people's moods.

The social media giant manipulated news feeds of just over 689,000 users to highlight either positive or negative items and then monitored responses over the course of a random week.

It found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses, but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts, according to the results of a study published this week in PNAS Journal.

Massive study: A team of researchers culling data from nearly 700,000 Facebook users found that our moods are affected by posts from friends

‘This tested whether exposure to emotions led people to change their own posting behaviors, in particular whether exposure to emotional content led people to post content that was consistent with the exposure,’ the study said.

Researchers found that negative posts are met with encouragement, but a reduction in happy posts was met with a surprising amount of negativity.

‘When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred,’ said the team.

Posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word, according to the researchers.

‘These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.’

Of the millions of posts analyzed, four-million were found to be positive and 1.8million were determined to be negative.

The findings led the team to conclude that ‘in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion.’

This experiment was limited to users who viewed Facebook in English, but it is not known across which geographic boundaries. The social network has more than 1.28billion active users around the world.
