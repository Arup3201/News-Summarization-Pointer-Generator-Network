A barman was hit in the face with a beer bottle by a drunken woman, leaving a jagged scar across his forehead like the one sported by Harry Potter.

Jordan Sedgwick, 22, was trying to help eject Nicole Howe from a nightclub in Accrington, Lancashire, when the 21-year-old woman began throwing bottles at him.

One struck him in the head and as Mr Sedgwick tried to escape with blood pouring from a head wound, Howe attempted to get over the bar at the Voodoo Club so she could scratch and kick him.

When police arrived, Howe defiantly told a sergeant: ‘I would do it again. I bottled him because he gave my brother verbals and you don’t do that.’

The cut to Mr Sedgwick’s forehead needed nine stitches. He told police his injury has been likened to the one sported by Potter, following Lord Voldemort’s failed murder attempt on the fictional wizard.

Mr Sedgwick is still working behind the bar but has lost so much confidence he no longer wants to progress to management and suffers nightmares.

After the attack, Howe was dragged kicking and screaming from the club and kicked a sergeant repeatedly in the face as she was being placed in patrol car.

Referring to a previous conviction in which she kicked a policeman in the groin, Howe boasted: ‘That’s two police assaults now I have done. Can’t assault enough of you.’

But at Burnley Crown Court, Howe was spared jail after offering ‘genuine remorse’ over her violent conduct and because she had been ‘lightly convicted.’

Lisa Worsley, prosecuting, said the incident occurred on April 13 when Howe was being ejected after aggressive behaviour at the bar.

She went back in, threw two bottles and then approached the victim again and began kicking and scratching at him. The first bottle cut Mr Sedgwick’s head, causing a 1.2in (3cm) cut.

Howe was picked up by a doorman and thrown out. Miss Worsley said: ‘She was put in the police vehicle, while the officer carried out inquiries.

‘The officer was concerned at Howe’s behaviour in the rear passenger seat as she was kicking out forcefully at the window, causing the glass to bulge outwards.

‘The sergeant opened the door and tried to pile on top of the defendant to stop her kicking, but Howe managed to get her legs in the air, pulled them back and kicked the officer three or four times in the face. The officer suffered reddening and slight discomfort to her face.

The prosecutor said: ‘Mr Sedgwick says he lost confidence after the attack. He was still working at the bar, but would leave if he could afford it. He had had ambitions to progress to management, but no longer wanted to do that. 

'He was extremely shaken up by what happened, had had nightmares and had to take leave from his full-time job because the injury was noticeable and he felt everybody was staring at him and making a judgement.

‘The remaining scar has affected his confidence and he had had to grow his hair to conceal it. He says the scar has been compared to that of Harry Potter and he’s suffered some torment as a result of that.’

Howe who admitted wounding was sentenced to 13 months in prison, suspended for two years, with 12 months’ supervision, 180 hours unpaid work and the Specified Activity Requirement for alcohol treatment.

In 2011, Howe left a policeman in agony when she kicked him in the groin when he was called to eject her from a Salvation Army Hostel for being drunk.

On that occasion she was given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay the officer £50 compensation after claiming she could remember nothing of the incident. She also had a caution for being drunk and disorderly in a separate incident.

Sara Dodd, defending, said: ‘The night of this incident was the anniversary of her deceased father’s birthday. It’s not an excuse, but it may explain the condition she got herself into.

‘Her two great ambitions in life are to have work and to have a home. Custody would inevitably mean the loss of both of these.’

Miss Dodd told the hearing there had been no further incidents of drunkenness or drunken violence in the six months since, and that Howe’s remorse was genuine.

She added: ‘There is a clear link between alcohol use and her offending behaviour.’

The judge Mr Recorder Roger Farley, QC, told Howe: ‘What you did, you know, was completely disgraceful. You have a previous conviction for assaulting a police officer and apparently took some delight in doing so.’

The judge added that he could suspend the sentence because the defendant was ‘lightly convicted’ and because of her guilty pleas.
