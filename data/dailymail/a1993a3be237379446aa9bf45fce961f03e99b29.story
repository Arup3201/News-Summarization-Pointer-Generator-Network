Bristol will today become the first UK city to pilot outdoor smoke-free areas.

Millennium Square and Anchor Square now have voluntary cigarette bans after a poll found 61 per cent of locals were in favour of the idea.

New York, Toronto and Hong Kong already have similar bans in key outdoor locations.

The British trial has been set up by the local government group Smoke-free South West.

Bristol's Millennium Square (pictured) now has a voluntary cigarette ban in place after locals voted in favour

It has placed signs in the popular harbourside squares, thanking people for keeping the areas smoke-free, healthy and clean. It expects the scheme to police itself. 

Mother Kirsty Vass, 33, inspired the smokefree pilot in Bristol after being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) a year ago when one of her lungs collapsed.

Ms Vass, who smoked 20 cigarettes a day for more than 15 years, is now constantly short of breath, unable to travel and has to be supported by her 15-year-old daughter, Lucy.

'My smoking illness has caused my whole world to come crashing down,' Ms Vass, of Torbay, Devon, said.

'If young people see you smoking then they think its alight, but they don't understand what it can do to you, so making smoking less visible in public places can only be a good thing.

'I don't want other people to be like me because this isn't a life, it's a life sentence. If I can make people realise that this is what smoking does to you then please, please, please quit now because it's really not worth it, especially if you've got kids.' 

Daniella Radice, assistant mayor for Public Health at Bristol City Council, added: 'I am excited to see how this pilot can change people's habits and make Bristol an even more enjoyable place to live and to visit'

Director Fiona Andrews said: 'These squares are often full of children playing, and this will provide a smoke-free environment for them to enjoy.' 

Councillor Daniella Radice, assistant mayor for Public Health at Bristol City Council, added: 'In this year that Bristol is proud to be the European Green Capital, I am excited to see how this pilot can change people's habits and make Bristol an even more enjoyable place to live and to visit.' 

Last year former health minister Lord Darzi called for a smoking ban in public spaces and parks in UK cities.
