Perfect present: The watch features a tourbillon (an escapement and balance wheel in a rotating cage) to negate the effects of gravity and a perpetual calendar, which needs no adjustment for leap years and New Year

A rare Girard-Perregaux Opera Two, the watch is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship, displaying its intricate mechanics on the ivory dial.

It features a tourbillon (an escapement and balance wheel in a rotating cage) to negate the effects of gravity and a perpetual calendar, which needs no adjustment for leap years and New Year.

Minute repeater watches, like this quad-gong Westminster version, were invented before electric lighting existed. They enabled people not
only to read the time, but also to hear it.

Among the most complex watchmaking 
mechanisms, each piece is unique, with every component of meticulously 
assembled and decorated by hand, requiring around 500 hours' work.

A minute repeater can be controlled to 
sound every hour, quarter-hour and minute by means of hammer-strikes on 
bells, which have been tuned by the watchmaker just like a musical 
instrument.

Kyron Keogh, MD of ROX, said: 'This is
an incredibly rare and innovative time piece which would take pride of 
place in any watch enthusiast’s collection.

The £1million store is home to the ROX Thrill 
Room – a decadent shopping lounge with a Laurent-Perrier bar.

diamond jewellery and  watches from brands including Hublot,
