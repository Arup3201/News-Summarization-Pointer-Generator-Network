Behind bars: Jesse Helt, 22, turned himself in to police Thursday and was arrested for violating the terms of his probation 

Miley Cyrus’ homeless VMA date finally turned himself in to police Thursday night and was formally arrested for violating the conditions of his probation.

Jesse Helt walked in to Polk County Jail in Dallas, Oregon just before 8pm and was booked in by duty officers.

Helt had been on the run from the authorities for three years and lived homeless on the streets of Los Angeles before he shot to fame at the MTV Video Music Awards last Sunday.

Martin Silbernagel, Polk County Director of Community Corrections, said the 22-year-old is expected to post $2,500 bail and will be released within hours.

'He turned himself in and was arrested, we expect a court date in two weeks,' he said.

Homeless Helt has been on the run from police since moving to Los Angeles, where he lived on the streets after breaking probation following a drugs test back in 2011.

A judge in his home state of Oregon issued a warrant for his arrest for repeatedly violating the terms of his probation.

Police visited Helt’s family home in Salem, Oregon Tuesday – the morning after he had flown in from LA following his MTV VMA stage appearance, where he accepted an award for Miley Cyrus.

But officers left empty handed after his mother, Linda Helt, said he was not home.

It is believed Helt has since been in crisis talks with family members, and it is understood Miley's camp has been offering advice.

Questions will also be raised as to whether Miley paid his bail to get him released.

Earlier today, an expensive SUV with California plates pulled up outside the family home and a well-dressed woman took a tray of drinks inside the house.

An onlooker said: 'The woman looked very well turned out, like an attorney, she certainly looked out of place on Jesse's street.'

Helt was under mounting pressure to hand himself in after the head of corrections, Mr Silbernagel, sent him a stern message saying: ‘You can run and hide but we will find you’.

He added: ‘If he wants to continue living his life looking over his shoulder making sure law enforcement isn’t behind him, that’s up to him.

‘But eventually what goes around comes around and we will find him.’

Helt could face up to a year in jail if a judge looks dimly on his behavior.

He was arrested in October 2010 after he tried to break into an apartment where he said a man had sold 'bad marijuana' to him.

He was charged with burglary, criminal mischief in the third degree and criminal trespass in the first degree.

The burglary charge was later dropped.

On November 23 of the same year, he was given 30 days in county jail, placed on supervised probation for 12 months, fined $572 and ordered to pay restitution, according to Polk County Circuit Court.

In mugshots obtained by MailOnline, Helt was booked on probation violations on July 24, 2011, and August 22, 2011.

In February 2012, Helt made the Most Wanted List for Polk County. He was listed number two on the list wanted for first-degree trespass.

According to court documents seen by MailOnline, he has three formal probation violations to his name.

The spotlight first turned to wannabe model Helt when Cyrus put him on stage in front of millions of people to accept an award on her behalf at the MTV VMA bash in LA Sunday night.

The star wanted Helt’s speech to draw attention to 1.6million homeless youths and raise money for charity.

But it has since emerged Helt has a checkered past and question marks have been raised over his homeless status given family members have said he had a place to stay in Oregon.

Cyrus first hit out on Twitter Tuesday after it was revealed that Jesse was a wanted man.

In one tweet, the Wrecking Ball singer wrote: 'People who are homeless have lived very hard lives. Jesse included.'

She also tweeted that she hoped Jesse's case 'can be the start of a national conversation about youth homelessness and how to end it' and added: 'Does looking down upon the homeless help people excuse their inaction'.

The star’s defense of Jesse continued when she tweeted: ‘While the media obsesses over one homeless mans legal issue, let's help the other 1.6 million homeless youth.’

Helt had a history of breaching the terms of his probation before he vanished from Polk County.

On October 19, 2011 Helt reported to Polk County Community Corrections and signed an action plan directing him to participate in a curfew between 10pm to 6am.

He was required to stay at his mother’s house during these hours.

Helt was also directed to report for drug testing every Wednesday, but the following Wednesday he failed to turn up.

On November 4, Helt’s probation officer visited the family home looking for him and was met by Helt’s mom in the driveway.

She said Helt wasn’t there and that he hadn’t been at the home for ‘a few days’.

That was the last time he had any contact with the authorities before fleeing to LA.

Helt failed to complete any of his community service for the month of October and still has 48 hours outstanding.

He also owes $460 to the Polk County Community Corrections and has an outstanding balance of $1,855.17 owed in court-ordered financial obligations.

Activist: The Wrecking Ball singer eloquently wrote about people like Jesse who are living on the streets 

According to a court document recommending that a warrant be issued for his arres, all of Helt's violations outlined the same behavior: 'failing to report, failing to submit to UA testing, and failure to complete community service.'

It added: 'Helt is not applying himself to supervision and is now not making himself available to supervision.

'Due to Helt's continued non-compliant behavior it is in this officer's opinion that Helt is no longer a candidate for community based supervision.'

Earlier this week Helt's father said it is ‘heart-breaking’ to learn his son was sleeping rough in Hollywood - but said he is baffled why his son never reached out for help.

Former Pepsi Cola executive Dennis Helt, 61, said: ‘I thought he was still chasing his dream, I didn’t know he was homeless, he didn’t share that information with me.

‘If I’d known then maybe I could have helped him. It’s heart-breaking knowing he was going through that when he’s got a family to fall back on.’
