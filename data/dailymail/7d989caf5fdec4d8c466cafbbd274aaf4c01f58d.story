Daniel Sturridge looked straight out at his audience. Straight in the eye. He measured his words, slowly, to add emphasis. He pronounced every last syllable.

‘I’ll be truthful,’ he said. ‘I am going to do anything in my power to win this next game. I am prepared to do anything and I am talking anything. 

‘I’m being serious. It is do or die. It’s a World Cup. I’m hungry, I’m confident and I’m so happy to be out here.

‘This means everything to every single individual in this squad. Do I want to go home early? No. I want to win this World Cup like everyone back home wants us to win it and I’d be gutted to go out in the group. 

‘It means the world to me to play for England and I’d be devastated if that happened. So, yes, anything. And I’m being totally honest with you guys.’

As the question had concerned Gus Poyet’s assertion that Uruguay would use any means necessary to win a World Cup game - and he produced quite an exhaustive list of dark arts as evidence - it was amusing to watch the colour drain from the faces of the Football Association as Sturridge spoke. 

Dr Steve Peters and the FA’s media squad are working so hard to control the inner chimps out here and then Sturridge goes and fills the room with talk of monkey business. 

He clarified, of course. He wouldn’t cheat, he said. Wouldn’t dive, wouldn’t punch the ball off the line to deny a Uruguayan winner - not that he will often be in that position, to be fair - would only act within the laws of the game.

Yet, deep down, those in the room knew what he meant. Michael Owen said he didn’t cheat in 1998, either. 

He just didn’t struggle manfully to stay on his feet when he thought a tumbling alternative might win the game. 

Suffice to say, if Sturridge had received the same penalty area contact as Steven Gerrard in  Manaus on Saturday, maybe England would be reflecting on a  2-2 draw with Italy.

‘We’re an honest country,’ he said. ‘We go about our business in an honest way. No disrespect to other countries, I’m sure they are honest, too. 

‘But we play within the laws of the game. We don’t bend the rules. We play by the book. There’s nothing wrong with that. We’ve gone a long way doing it, from 1966 when we won the World Cup. We played within the laws and that’s how I was brought up, how everyone in our squad was brought up.

Daniel Sturridge has scored three goals in his last four England games - against Italy, Peru and Denmark. He averages 0.63 goals per game in an England shirt.

‘We don’t like to cheat to win. We want to play in an honest way. That’s how I feel football should be played.

‘I will stay on my feet. I will never dive on purpose to get some guy sent off. I’m not going to handle a goal to stop the ball going in the net because it’s not in my nature. So not diving, but I will do anything  - just like every single one of my team-mates - as Uruguay will, too. They’re hungry, just like us. And we’ll work our socks off, do more than we’ve ever done before.’

Up at Uruguay’s training base in Sete Lagoas near Belo Horizonte, Luis Suarez - a man who might not have added those calming qualifications at the end of such a speech - was declaring himself 100 per cent fit to face England. He can’t be, of course. If he was 100 per cent on Monday, he would have been around 80 per cent at the weekend and would surely have been introduced by Uruguay’s coach Oscar Taberez when the second Costa Rican goal went in. 

Never mind. Neither side is going to offer psychological advantage or  candid insights into team selection at this stage and, despite protestations to the contrary, England’s players were definitely guided not to make this match all about one man.

Sturridge met any direct question about his Liverpool team-mate with a vague, generic reply praising the entire Uruguayan team. 

So ask Suarez, get Diego Forlan, Edinson Cavani or a bland overview of a starting XI that to most eyes appears less than the sum of one part. 

Most definitely, there is a risk of thinking that any single man is a team. Yet with Uruguay it is an  undeniable truth that, like  Portugal, an individual has dragged them to this World Cup. 

Uruguay sneaked in as the final South American qualifiers, via a play-off win against Jordan. 

Without Suarez, however, they were undone by Costa Rica and in the second half their physically imposing yet clunky defence looked every day of its advancing age.

England will hope to exploit those same weaknesses in Sao Paulo on Thursday while playing down the fear that Suarez is planning to do the same to them, on the evidence of the 2-1 defeat by Italy. Asked what he will be telling  England’s defenders about his club partner, Sturridge offered that he was unpredictable, a tip as helpful as the knowledge that he will be wearing light blue. 

Still, there is an element of honesty about it at least. What is the defence mechanism against a player with Suarez’s mesmerising talent? 

As Bosnia-Herzegovina found against Lionel Messi on Sunday night, the true greats defy containment. 

For 65 minutes, they gave the little master barely a kick. And then he won the day for Argentina.

‘I think these days there is a lot of unpredictability in the best players’ games,’ said Sturridge. ‘Luis,  Neymar, Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo. You can’t tell players what to do against those guys. 

‘Show Arjen Robben down the line and he’ ll go another way, show Robben on his left foot and he’ll go on his right.

‘The best are unpredictable and Luis is unpredictable. So it’s not for us to worry just about Luis. We’re the players that are up against him most, the English defenders. We know him better than anyone else at the World Cup. 

‘Sure, he’s a world-class player, but we’re facing Uruguay, with  Cavani and Forlan, who is a legend in Uruguay and has done really well in Europe. There are other players who are technically very gifted.

‘Would I want Luis to be injured? Would I want to play against him? It doesn’t really matter. If Luis is fit, good luck to him. If not, there’ll be another hungry player doing his best. We’re worrying about Uruguay as a team, not just him. 

‘If they had won their last game against Costa Rica there wouldn’t have been such an obsession about him being fit. If they had won, people would have thought: “Oh, they’re OK without Luis”. 

‘Because they lost, people think no Luis is the reason behind it all. But it’s just speculation. He could have played and they might still have lost.

‘Look, we’re playing Uruguay. I don’t think they will be saying to watch out for Daniel Sturridge or Wayne Rooney or Steven Gerrard. We spoke a lot about Andrea Pirlo before the first game, but it still needed Claudio Marchisio to hit the ball in from all of 25 yards for their goal.’
