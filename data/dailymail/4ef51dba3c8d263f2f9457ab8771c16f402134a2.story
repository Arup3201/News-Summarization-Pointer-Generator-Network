Everton manager Roberto Martinez has confirmed a deal is close for Anderlecht teenager David Henen as the Spaniard looks to bolster the club's youth ranks.

The 18-year-old Belgian will go into the under-21 squad once his reported £1.5million move has been done.

'It is in the process of being completed,' Martinez told the Liverpool Echo.

Rising star: David Henen is on the verge of signing for Everton from Anderlecht for £1.5million

Versatile: The 18-year-old Belgian is usually a striker but can also be used on either wing

'He's a young, talented footballer who represents Belgium in the lower teams, in the under-18s and has had good experience in going to France.

'He is a bright boy and we feel he is something different that we haven't got in the under-21s so we are hoping he is going to be giving us something different in that group.

'We want a strong group. We have already got talented and very interesting footballers and I think David can fit in really well in that environment.'
