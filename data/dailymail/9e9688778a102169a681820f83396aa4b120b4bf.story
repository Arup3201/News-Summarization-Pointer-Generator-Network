Manchester United academy director Brian McClair has refused to rule out Tom Cleverley making a successful return to Old Trafford when his loan spell at Aston Villa finishes.

Despite being allowed to leave the club on loan this season by new boss Louis van Gaal, McClair has suggested Cleverley could resurrect his career at United. 

'You don't know what's going to happen because he's only on loan at Villa,' McClair told ESPN FC. 'I think he's a good player.

Tom Cleverley holds the ball from Aleksandar Kolarov while in action for Aston Villa against Manchester City 

'He came from Bradford when he was 12. At 16 we didn't offer him a scholarship. He stayed at school and he worked as hard he possibly could, while still at school and at the end of that two-year period, because he had developed more physically, he had a professional contract.

'He's gone on from that to represent his country and to play many games in the Premier League.'

Upon joining Villa, the 25-year-old vowed to put the negativity that marred his final season at United behind him, and prove wrong those who doubted his ability.  

Cleverley had a season to forget under David Moyes last season as United finished seventh in the league

But the club's academy director Brian McClair has suggested Cleverley could return and be a hit at United

He said: 'You don't turn into a bad player just because someone says it on Twitter. I probably wasn't the only United player to get it last year. For as long as Man United aren't winning trophies, players will get criticised. I'm fully aware of that. I've still got a league title, 13 England caps.

'If all the players say they were high in confidence last season I think they would be lying. It wasn't just me. It was the rest of the squad too.'
