Likely Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush on
Wednesday will seek to lay to rest any concerns that his views might be influenced by the legacies of
his father and brother. 

Bush, son of former President George H.W. Bush and brother
of former President George W. Bush, will address the issue
head-on in a speech at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs this afternoon, and will say, according to prepared marks, 'I am my own man.' 

It will be his first major foray into foreign policy since
the former Florida governor announced in December that he is strongly considering a run for the 2016 Republican presidential
nomination.

Running for president as part of a family dynasty is presenting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush with inevitable comparisons to his father and brother that he must address as he moves closer to a campaign for the White House. Today he will attempt to separate his views from theirs during a Chicago speech

Speech excerpts released by his political action committee, Right to Rise, show that Bush will say he has been lucky to have a father and a
brother who have shaped U.S. foreign policy and that he
recognizes 'my views will often be held up in comparison to
theirs - sometimes in contrast to theirs.'

'I love my father and my brother. I admire their service to
the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make. But I
am my own man, and my views are shaped by my own thinking and
own experiences,' he will say.

Bush is casting a wide net for advice on national security.
An aide provided to Reuters a diverse list of 20 diplomatic and
national security veterans who will be offering informal advice
to Bush in the coming months.

Many of them are from past Republican administrations,
including those of his father and brother as well as that of
Ronald Reagan.

The list includes people representing a wide spectrum of
ideological views in the Republican Party, from the pragmatic to
the hawkish.

It includes James Baker, known for his pragmatism
in key roles during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush
presidencies, and former World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz, a
hawk as deputy defense secretary who was an architect of George
W. Bush's Iraq War policy.

Among others are two former secretaries of Homeland
Security, Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, former national
security adviser Stephen Hadley and a deputy national security
adviser, Meghan O'Sullivan, as well as two former CIA directors,
Porter Goss and Michael Hayden.

With polls showing Bush a front-runner among Republican
candidates jockeying for the 2016 nomination, his aim is to set
his own course on US foreign policy without getting entangled
in a debate about the legacy of his father and older brother. 

Bush has said in the past that he supports his brother's
decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003, which could leave him
open to attack from Democrats should he win the nomination.  

His
complaint about the recent past in Iraq is that President Barack
Obama has let American influence wane in the region.

'Each president learns from those who came before, their
principles, their adjustments,' Bush will say. 'One thing we
know is this: Every president inherits a changing world, and
changing circumstances.'

Pre-butting Bush's afternoon speech, the Democratic National Committee circulated a 2010 clip of Bush refusing to criticize his brother's tenure at the White House during an appearance on CNN's State of the Union.

After then-host Candy Crowley asked Jeb which of his brother's policies he most disagreed with, the younger Bush - accompanied by his father for the interview - said, 'I’m the only Republican that was in office when he was in office as President that never disagreed with him and I’m not going to start now.'

Bush argued that it wouldn't make sense with his brother out of office to begin critiquing him.

'I’m not going to start now. It’s just till death do us part,' he said.

'Til death do us part': The Democratic National Committee pushed back on Bush's assertion that he won't be influenced by his brother or father by circulating a 2010 clip of Jeb refusing to criticize his brother's leadership

With both his father, who held the presidency for just one term before being ousted by Bill Clinton, and brother's legacies now threatening to overshadow his on presidential aspirations, Bush now finds himself in the precarious position of needing to visibly separate his policies from theirs without throwing either to the wolves.

Bush's Chicago speech is the second in a series of
appearances designed to outline the foundation for what is
likely to be a presidential campaign. 

Two weeks ago in Detroit at the launch of his leadership PAC he discussed his views on reducing income inequality and
bolstering the U.S. economy.

His Chicago speech comes as the United States grapples with
the threats posed by Islamic State militants and Russia's
aggression in eastern Ukraine.

Obama has relied heavily on air strikes against Islamic
State targets in Syria and Iraq, but the militants retain large
swathes of territory in both countries.

The United States has joined with European allies to impose
sanctions on Russia that have had an impact but have yet to
force Moscow to pull back.

Bush will criticize Obama's handling of foreign policy and
say that American leadership must projected consistently.

'Under this administration, we are inconsistent and
indecisive,' he will say. 'We have lost the trust and the
confidence of our friends. We definitely no longer inspire fear
in our enemies.'

His list of advisers suggests a willingness to listen to a
variety of views from people with long experience, including
former World Bank President Robert Zoellick.

Others include Paula Dobriansky, a former undersecretary of
state, Kristen Silverberg, a former U.S. ambassador to the
European Union, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, who was a long-time member
of the House of Representatives from Florida, and John Hannah
who was Vice President Dick Cheney's national security adviser.
