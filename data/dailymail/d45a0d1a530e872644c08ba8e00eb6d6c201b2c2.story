'No experience': The manager of Horny Escorts managed to get an advert for willing women onto a government website

A job as a £10-an-hour prostitute was advertised on a government website.

Officials at the Department for Work and Pensions mistakenly allowed the post on Direct Gov.

The cheeky manager of Horny Escorts tried his luck with a posting for female call girls.

The advert, which was uploaded on the Universal Jobmatch section of the website, read: ‘Female worker wanted to go out with guys maybe for evening or have full on sex.

The only qualification for the job - for which applicants would need 'no experience' - was that successful candidates 'must like sex'.

In grammatically incorrect English, the advert continued: 'This would be better if you was single and be able to work at your own pace. Looks and race unimportant. You will need a mobile phone.'

There was even an option for users of the popular jobseekers board to select a from a drop-down menu to 'tell us why you don't wish to apply for this job'.

The advert was posted by the boss of the agency last Monday.

The agency boasts of having 'the most gorgeous and sophisticated women and men in the UK.'

The manager said: 'I put the advert up there because it’s a job site and it’s a job. I was a bit shocked they allowed it.

'I also do deliveries and I had posted an ad for a same-day delivery service and then I just put the escorting one underneath it.

'The advert says "must like sex" because if a man pays for it obviously he’s going to want that.

'I thought the Department of Works and Pensions would admin it. I didn’t know it would go straight online.'

The manager said he decided to advertise after business slowed down, saying: 'It’s not been that good.'

Job site: The ad was uploaded to the Universal Jobmatch section of Direct Gov

A DWP spokesman admitted the blunder but refused to say if adverts were read before they were posted on the website

He said: 'The post was inappropriate and was taken down next day.

'When advertising jobs, employers have to agree to terms and conditions. Where an inappropriate job is identified it is quickly removed.'

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has led a crusade to crack unemployment by insisting the jobless should have to work unpaid or be stripped of their benefits.

Earlier this year, a Welsh government website offering career advice was taken down after telling entrepreneurs how to earn a fortune in the sex industry.

Business Wales gave tips on how to make up to £48,000 as a stripper and how to run an escort agency, a lap dancing club or an erotic boutique.

The website, launched to help stimulate the economy, suggested aspiring actors strip to earn extra income or become an escort which pays between £120-£250 an hour.

It was taken down in July after critics complained it was degrading to women and could lure 'potentially vulnerable young people.'
