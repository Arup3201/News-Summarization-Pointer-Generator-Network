Students at a top university burst out laughing in the middle of an exam when they realised the answers were stapled to their test papers.

The first year exam turned into a shambles after a printing error resulted in the paperâ€™s mark scheme being attached to the back of the questions booklet.

It gave first year students the answers to the complicated test for 40 Electrical and Information Engineering students at Imperial College, London.

Undergraduates say many 'began laughing' during the exam when they realised they had all the answers.

Upon being made aware of a situation, the convenor ran down from his office and, after discovering what had happened, reportedly couldn't help but join in with the laughter.

The convenor decided to remove the mark schemes from the test and give it back to students, hoping that they would not be able to remember most of the answers.

One of the students, speaking to newspaper The Tab, said: 'I raised my hand briefly, hoping to inform the invigilators of the error, but quickly retracted it after realising I might be the only one with the mark scheme.

'On looking around, I heard one of my peers sniggering at the front of the exam hall, and then seconds later the whole hall was in stitches as our examiners looked on blankly.

'Surely the best start to any of my exams.'

An Imperial College spokesperson said: 'During an examination being taken by 30 first-year Electrical and Electronic Engineering students, the first page of the answer scheme was included alongside the question paper due to a printing error.'The Department became aware of the situation within five minutes of the exam beginning. The exam was halted and the papers were removed from the students.

'The Department reviewed the situation carefully and concluded that students would not have been able to use the information to any advantage during the short time they had access to part of the answer scheme.

'The exam questions required students to demonstrate the application of an algorithm to a given data set setting out detailed reasoning in their solutions. The required algorithms were not revealed in the answer scheme. 'Once this was established, the exam recommenced with the correct version of the question paper.'
