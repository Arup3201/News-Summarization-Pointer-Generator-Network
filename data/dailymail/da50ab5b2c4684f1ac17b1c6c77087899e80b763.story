Hundreds of babies are being born clinically obese every year - including some weighing more than a stone.

As many as 1,403 newborns have been classified as obese since 2011, according to shocking figures from a series of Freedom of Information requests.

At just one trust nearly 400 babies born in the last four years weighed 9lb 15oz or more - the marker for an obese baby.

Peterborough and Stamford ­Hospitals Trust also recorded 280 exceptionally large babies and another 265 arrived at George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust in Warwickshire.

There has also been an increase in the number of babies weighing 12lb or more.

Seven clinics reported births of so-called 'sumo babies' in 2013 - including two where the babies weighed more than a stone.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said that although some mothers suffer from medical conditions, which increase the size of the baby, most just overeat. 

He said: 'Quite simply, the number of pregnant women who are obese at the start is increasing.

'It is thought that 82 per cent of children who are obese will continue to be overweight.

'As they have the same kind of nutrition as their parents there is  a continuous upwards spiral.

Eva (above) was born in 2013 and weighed 12lb 6oz - 5lb more than the average baby girl 

One mother has given birth to two big babies in the last 18 months.

Danica Slavin had her first daughter Eva Lily Margerrison in 2013 and was shocked when she weighed in at 12lb 6oz. 

But she was even more surprised when three weeks ago she gave birth to her son Jack, who, at 10lb 3oz, was nearly just as big. 

Both babies had to be delivered via caesarean at Jessop Wing maternity unit.

The 21-year-old mother, from Sheffield, met her partner Sam Margerrison four years ago when they worked at fast-food chain Burger King. 

She said: 'I don't know why Eva and Jack were so big because me and my partner Sam weren't big babies.

'I was tested for gestational diabetes with both babies but that was ruled out.

'I just had big babies.' 

She explained that Jack was currently on formula and Eva enjoyed her fruit and vegetables. 

She also dismissed claims that the size of a baby at birth related to its parents. 

'You obviously don't expect a baby of that size,' she said.  

'Successive governments have not really addressed the obesity problem. It starts at conception and sometimes even before then.' 

Mr Fry also suggested that the number of women having caesareans was increasing due to the increasing size of their babies.

He said: 'Some babies are so fat they cannot come out naturally.

'Women have to understand that they have to keep themselves in shape due to the huge responsibility they have of producing the next generation. 

'If we get it wrong, it's a vicious circle and it will just go on and on and on.' 

Toddlers are also being hospitalised for being obese, with 28 two-year-olds and 33 three-year-olds admitted since 2011, Laura Connor revealed in her Sunday Mirror investigation.

Freedom of Information requests were sent to 153 hospital trusts in the country and received 110 replies.

Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust - 372

Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals Trust - 280

George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust - 265

Bedford Hospital NHS Trust - 220 

London North West Healthcare NHS Trust - 165  

The average weight of a baby boy is 7lb 8oz and for a girl it is 7lb 4oz.  

Childhood obesity can lead to a number of medical problems including diabetes, heart disease, strokes and cancer.  

A Royal College of Midwives spokesman said: 'It starts pre-conceptually. If a woman is trying to get pregnant then she should already be eating healthily and not drinking or smoking.

'It is a common myth that the woman should eat for two. Really, she should be just taking in lots of vegetables and a balanced diet. 

'Long walks and gentle jogs can also help.'

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: 'It is thought that 82 per cent of children who are obese will continue to be overweight'
