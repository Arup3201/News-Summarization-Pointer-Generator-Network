Lewis Hamilton has vowed to win this year's Formula One world title after clear-the-air talks with Mercedes team-mate and bitter rival Nico Rosberg.

Mercedes have taken 'suitable disciplinary measures' against Rosberg after he 'acknowledged his responsibility' for the collision with Hamilton in Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix.

The Brackley-based marque have also confirmed the duo can continue to race for the title, without intervention from the team, providing they keep it clean over the closing seven races.

Blame game: Hamilton at first came out strongly against his teammate but now refuses to point fingers 

Although Hamilton is 29 points adrift of Rosberg in the championship after failing to finish at Spa, whilst the German went on to finish second, such a scenario has only stiffened his resolve.

'It's going to be a tough road from here, but championships have been won from much further back than I am now,' said Hamilton.

'And I promise you I will be giving everything and more to win this for my team, for my family and for my fans,'

For now, the hatchet has been buried, with Hamilton acknowledging that previous events between the pair this year resulted in Rosberg taking matters into his own hands on Sunday.

As far as Hamilton is concerned, he appreciates it is crucial he and Rosberg give their all, not just as individuals in their quest for the title, but more importantly for the team.

'Nico and I accept we have both made mistakes and I feel it would be wrong to point fingers and say which one is worse than the other,' said Hamilton, on his official website.

'What's important is how we rise as a team from these situations. We win and we lose together and, as a team, we will emerge stronger.

'There is a deep foundation that still exists for me and Nico to work from, in spite of our difficult times and differences.

'We have the greatest team, the strongest group of individuals who have worked their hands to the bone to give us the best car you see us racing today.

'It's important we never forget that and give them the results they deserve.'

After initially remarking his version of events were 'very different' to that of Hamilton after the Briton revealed from a heated post-race meeting Rosberg had conceded to causing an accident 'on purpose', the German has since been forced to issue sincere apologies.

A further meeting unfolded on Friday at the team's Brackley base involving the drivers, motorsport boss Toto Wolff and executive technical director Paddy Lowe, with Rosberg contrite.

Via a statement, Rosberg said: 'The number one rule for us as team mates is we must not collide, but that is exactly what happened.

'For that error of judgement, I apologise to Lewis and the team.

'I also want to say sorry to the fans who were deprived of our battle for the lead in Belgium.'

Rosberg has now promised 'hard, fair competition on and off track right up to the final lap of the season in Abu Dhabi'.

That will serve Mercedes well as they have vowed 'another such incident will not be tolerated', albeit confirming the duo 'remain free to race' for the rest of the campaign.

April 6: During the third race of the season in Bahrain, Hamilton cuts across Rosberg, almost causing a crash. Rosberg appeals to the team over radio, saying 'Tell him that was not on!'. The British driver holds on to win the race, with Rosberg second.

May 11: In Spain Hamilton switches engine modes without the team's permission to hold off Rosberg and win the race. 

May 24: Qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix sees the two drivers have their most public flashpoint. Rosberg crashes while on course for pole, denying Hamilton the chance to set a quicker time. Hamilton alleges the crash was deliberate but the German is cleared of any intent. Rosberg wins the race from pole. 

August 24: The two drivers collide on lap two in Belgium, with Rosberg later admitting he did not try to prevent the crash.
