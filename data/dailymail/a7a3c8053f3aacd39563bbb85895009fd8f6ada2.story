A Tory grandee today warned that he would sue for libel if newspapers repeat false internet rumours linking him to paedophilia.

In an unusual move, Sir Peter Bottomley issued a public denial of any involvement in child sex abuse in a bid to counter false claims circulating on websites.

Sir Peter said people were using the current controversy about an alleged cover-up of child sex abuse at Westminster to ‘restart’ disproved rumours about him from the 1980s.

Sir Peter Bottomley, married to the former Conservative Cabinet minister Virginia Bottomley, issued a public denial of any involvement in child sex abuse in a bid to counter false claims circulating on websites

Sir Peter, who is married to the former Conservative Cabinet minister Virginia Bottomley, told Radio Four’s Today programme that people were also now wrongly suggesting that he may have visited the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, south-west London, which is at the centre of some of the current claims.

The Elm Guest House is alleged to have been the scene of paedophile activity and sex parties attended by politicians and other prominent figures in the 1970s and 1980s. Visitors are said to have included the late Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith.

Sir Peter, 69, successfully sued The Mail on Sunday in 1989 after it printed a false story about him. Today he said he would have no hesitation in doing so again if the rumours appear in print.

He said: ‘People are trying to restart [the rumours]; people are trying to somehow to connect it to the Elm Guest House, a place I’ve not been to, where I’ ve not been involved. And I give this public warning - if any substantial publisher links me in any defamatory way, they can expect the same kind of action as The Mail on Sunday got.’

Sir Peter dismissed suggestions there had been a conspiracy to cover up abuse by Establishment figures

Sir Peter, who said he had always gone out of his way to help whistleblowers, said he backed the idea of a wide-ranging inquiry into claims that senior figures were involved in child sex abuse, provided it did not interfere with police investigations.

But he dismissed suggestions that there had been a major conspiracy to cover up abuse by Establishment figures.

He said successive governments did not take seriously enough the activities of groups like the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, ‘partly because people couldn’t believe it, partly because there may have been one or two senior people in the police or some other forms of public life’.

But he added: ‘The idea that there could be an organised group that could stop things happening is, I think, imagination.

‘If I tried to organise a conspiracy on something I knew a lot about I think it would fall apart in two or three days. If this were an organised conspiracy there would be much more there.’
