They may be more commonly associated with workmen, but Australian spies will now have to wear high visability vests when they are at work

It may mean the end for any undercover operation.

It has been revealed that Australian spies have to wear high visability vests when they are at work.

The country’s strict Commonwealth Work Health and Safety Act means that everyone working for the government must wear a bright yellow or orange safety vest.

It means, of course, that any spy trying to work, following a foreign agent for example, has a great deal of difficulty in remaining out of sight.

The work place rule applies to all officers working on the job for the Australian Secret Intelligence Service.

The service’s spies work mostly overseas, collecting intelligence against individuals or organizations who might be plotting against Australia’s interests.

On its website it claims: ‘ASIS is Australia’s overseas secret intelligence collection agency. Our mission is to protect and promote Australia’s vital interests through the provision of intelligence services as directed by Government.’

But it is understood that whether the spy work involves peeping on foreign agents overseas or on home soil, the Health and Safety regulations must still apply because the spies are paid by the government.

Two other spy groups – the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and its Australian Defence Force counterpart – are exempted from the rule of wearing safety vests.

Learning of the problem that exists for the Secret Intelligence Service spies, the government is now taking steps to make life a little easier for its agents.

Amendments are now before Parliament which will allow the ASIS director-general to waive the vest requirement.

Foreign Affairs parliamentary secretary Richard Marles told parliament that it might be tough for spies to follow hazard reduction to a tee.

In these environments, the requirements of national security may not always be compatible with full compliance with Australian work health and safety obligations,’ said Mr Marles.

‘Indeed, full compliance could in some circumstances place people who work for the director-general of ASIS at risk and prejudice national security.’
