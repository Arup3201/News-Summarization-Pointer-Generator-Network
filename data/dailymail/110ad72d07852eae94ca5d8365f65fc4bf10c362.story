Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev displayed a disturbing pattern of verbal abuse and violence toward women that included fits of rage against his wife and an arrest in 2009 for slapping a previous girlfriend, according to police records and accounts from those who knew him. 

Close friends of his wife Katherine Russell, 24, claimed today that Tsarnaev, 26, was combative, angry and controlling.

His wife hasn't spoken publicly about her husband since he was killed in a shootout with police early Friday morning. But it appears she spoke to federal authorities for the first time on Tuesday, after she was spotted leaving her Rhode Island family home with her lawyer and three federal investigators. She returned home nearly four hours later with her mother.

Katherine Russell's lawyers released this statement on Tuesday morning at her request:

'As you know from news reports, Katie married her husband in June of 2010. Since then, she has been living in Cambridge, raising her child and working long hours, caring for people in their homes who are unable to care for themselves.

'Katie grew up in Rhode Island and has always remained close to her parents and sisters here, as well as her extended family.

'She is fortunate to have the support of her loving family now, as they, too, struggle to come to terms with these events and the deep sorrow we all feel following the events of last week.

'Meanwhile, she is doing everything she can to assist with the investigation.

'The injuries and loss of life - to people who came to celebrate a race and a holiday - has caused profound distress and sorrow to Katie and her family.

'The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all.

'As a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, Katie deeply mourns the pain and loss to innocent victims - students, law enforcement, families and our community. In the aftermath of this tragedy, she, her daughter and her family are trying to come to terms with these events.'

Afterwards, her lawyers released a statement at her request that claimed she has been 'doing everything she can to assist with the investigation.'

'The injuries and loss of life - to 
people who came to celebrate a race and a holiday - has caused profound 
distress and sorrow to Katie and her family,' the statement read. 'The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all.'

Three of Russell's friends told 
National Public Radio's Laura Sullivan that Tsarnaev would often insult 
Russell and call her names, such as 'slut' and 'prostitute.'

He was known to fly into into fits of rage where he would throw objects, including furniture, friends said.

Russell's lawyer, Amato DeLuca, said she was a student at Suffolk University when she was introduced to Tsarnaev at a nightclub. He didn't specify the exact date that they met, though it's believed to be sometime during 2009.

Tsarnaev was seeing another woman at the time, he said.

'They went out for a while, and then they stopped and then they went out again,' DeLuca said.

It's possible the other woman that Tsarnaev was apparently dating was 25-year-old Nadine Ascencao of Brookline, Mass.

Tsarnaev was arrested in July 2009 for allegedly slapping Ascencao, according to court records.

Ascencao
 was 'crying hysterically' and called 911 to report that she was 'beat 
up by her boyfriend,' Cambridge Police Officer Angela 
Pereira wrote in the arrest report.

Tsarnaev told Pereira and another officer that his girlfriend 'was yelling at him because of another girl.'

Asked whether he had hit Ascencao, Tsarnaev stated, 'Yes, I slapped her.' He specifically stated that he struck the left side of her face.

Eleven months later, Tsarnaev was apparently no longer dating Aschencao. He had persuaded Russell to convert from Christianity to Islam and the couple married on June 21, 2010.

Around the same time, Russell
 became pregnant with Tsarnaev's baby. She 
dropped out of school in her senior year and reportedly began pulling away from her friends and 
family.

Mary 
Silberman, whose apartment backs up to Tsarnaev's Cambridge home, said she often heard loud arguments late at night that mostly
 consisted of a woman's voice yelling at a man.

'It wasn't enough to call the police,' Silberman told Reuters. 'It didn't sound like anyone was in physical danger.'

But the shouting was often loud enough to keep her awake at night. She could also hear the couple's daughter, Zahara, now three years old, wailing at night and she often wondered why the mother wasn't responding, she said.

As the girl grew into a toddler, Silberman said she would see Zahara staring out the window.

Since Tsarnaev's death, Russell has been staying with her family in North Kingstown, Rhode Island.

Her lawyer, Amato DeLuca, told CNN on Monday that the 24-year-old is 'very distraught' and 'cries a lot.'

Regarding the bomb plot, DeLuca said, 'She knew nothing about it at any time.'

'The
 whole family is a mess, to put it bluntly,' he said. 'They're very 
distraught. They're upset. Their lives have been unalterably changed. 
They're upset because of what happened, the people that were injured, 
that were killed. It's an awful, terrible thing.'

Timeline: Sometime around 2008, Tsarnaev's erratic and violent behavior escalated as he stopped smoking and drinking and suddenly became heavily involved in Islam

Tsarnaev, who had appeared in surveillance photos wearing a black cap and was identified as Suspect No. 1, died days after the bombing

Russell works 70 to 80 hours a week as a home health aide, according to family members. Tsarnaev was unemployed.

Judith Russell, the 24-year-old's mother, read an emotional statement to the media outside the timber-framed detached family home.

‘Our daughter has lost her husband today, the father of her child,' she said. 'We cannot begin to comprehend how this horrible tragedy occurred. Our hearts are sickened by the knowledge of the horror he has inflicted.’

She added: ‘In the aftermath of the Patriots’ Day horror, we now know that we never really knew Tamerlan Tsarnaev.’
