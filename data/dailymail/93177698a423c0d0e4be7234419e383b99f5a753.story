This is the horrific moment an off-duty New York policeman was beaten to within an inch of his life during a 5.30am brawl.

Sergeant Mohammed Deen was attacked outside a restaurant in Ozone Park, Queens, while his wife watched helplessly from their parked car.

The 40-year-old was knocked to the ground and repeatedly kicked and punched - before being left unconscious on the street.

Brutal: Sergeant Mohammed Deen, 40, was repeatedly punched and kicked outside a restaurant in Queens. His attacker - identified police as Hayden Holder, 29 - has been remanded in custody on a felony assault charge

Sgt Deen - who has worked for the NYPD for 18 years - suffered serious injuries in the brutal assault, which was captured on a passerby's mobile phone and uploaded to Facebook.

He was taken to Jamaica Hospital and has now been placed in a medically induced coma, according to the New York Post.

The sickening footage shows his attacker - identified by police as Hayden Holder, 29 - repeatedly bashing Sgt Deen's head against the ground outside St John's Express restaurant on Liberty Avenue.

Terrifying: Holder tries to smash the windows of Sgt Deen's parked BMW, where his horrified wife is cowering

Holder then tries to attack the Sgt Deen's terrified wife - who is cowering in the police officer's BMW sedan - by attempting to smash the car's windows.

Failing to do so, Holder then returns to his unconscious victim - who is lying motionless of the ground - before continuing to punch and kick his body.

'This was a vicious, savage beating,’ said a shocked police officer who was called to the scene.

Holder, from Jamaica, attempted to flee the scene, but was later arrested and charged with felony assault.

He was taken to the police station in a hospital gown after being treated for injuries to his hand.

Sgt Deen, who is currently assigned to the 32nd Precinct in Harlem, is believed to have argued with the thug at Maracus nightclub, about a mile away, earlier in the night.

It was unclear what sparked the row - however, Facebook users have speculated that Sgt Deen accidentally bumped into Holder.

Holder has been remanded in custody.
