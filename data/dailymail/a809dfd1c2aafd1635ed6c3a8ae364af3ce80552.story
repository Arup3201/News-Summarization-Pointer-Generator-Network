Chancellor George Osborne said the EU had to change for Britain to remain part of it

The European Union must change if Britain is to remain a member, George Osborne warned yesterday.

In a stark ultimatum, the Chancellor suggested Britain would quit the EU unless Brussels agreed to major reforms, including the repatriation of a string of powers to the UK.

Asked whether the UK would still be in the EU in ten years, Mr Osborne said: ‘I very much hope that Britain remains a member of the EU.

But in order that we can remain in the European Union, the EU must change.’

The Chancellor’s explicit warning that Britain will quit the EU unless other member states agree to a major renegotiation of the relationship came in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt.

It will pile pressure on David Cameron to follow suit when he makes his long-awaited speech on Europe later this month.

Mr Cameron has said that life outside the EU is ‘imaginable’ but has suggested he is reluctant to include the option of leaving in any referendum.

Coalition tensions on the issue were underlined last night when Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable suggested the growing debate about Britain’s membership of the EU was damaging business confidence in the economy.

Mr Cable said the issue was ‘a massive disruption and deeply unhelpful in my job’.

He claimed that quitting the EU would result in the UK descending into the politics of economic protectionism and nationalism which the single market rules currently prevent.

In a surprise intervention, the leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament hit out at those in his own party demanding a hard line against Brussels.

Prime Minister David Cameron is due to set out his vision for a new 'settlement' with Europe within the next fortnight

David Cameron's long-awaited speech on
 Europe is to be finally delivered in the Netherlands, Downing Street 
sources have suggested.

Except
 no one seems to have told the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte 
(pictured), who is in the dark about the contents of the speech and 
claims he will be unveiled as a key ally in the battle to have powers 
and money returned from Brussels.

Stephan
 Schrover, official spokesman for
 Mr Rutte, told MailOnline that far from being signed up to Mr Cameron's
 vision for Europe 'we not aware of information about it'.

'We
 do not know where or when [the speech will be). We are very curious,' he added.

'We have not had any involvement in the preparation of this.'

And
 in a blow to Mr Cameron's hopes of winning backing for Britain to have 
looser ties with the EU, Mr Shrover added: 'We are not aiming for opt 
outs or something like that.

'We are also not in redefinition of our relationship with the European Union.

'What
 we want is a better functioning European Union, strengthening the 
internal market, getting the costs down – that kind of thing.'

He
 insisted Mr Cameron was welcome to visit the country but added: ‘We 
don’t have any information about whether he is coming to the 
Netherlands.’

Asked if 
Britain should stay in the EU, he replied: ‘Of course. We think it is 
important that there is Britain the European Union.

'We
 have done some common activities about stimulating growth, freed trade…
 we have a common stand in those issue but of course there are also many
 differences.’

MEP Richard Ashworth said the strident Euroscepticism gave the impression of a Britain that was ‘snarling like a pitbull across the Channel’.

He said Britain was ‘making ourselves look pretty darned unattractive’ as a partner in the EU.

Discussing Mr Cameron’s ambition to claw back powers from Brussels, he said an ‘evolutionary solution’ was the way to proceed, rather than the ‘nuclear option’ of quitting the EU.

But Tory Eurosceptics  welcomed the Chancellor’s intervention.

Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said Mr Cameron would get the best deal for Britain only if he made it clear the UK was otherwise prepared to quit.

He urged the Prime Minister to hold an immediate referendum to give him a mandate to negotiate with Brussels, followed by a second referendum on the deal in which the British people would have the option to leave the EU.

Mr Cable, in a speech at King’s College, London, made it clear the Lib Dems would resist any attempt to have a major renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the EU.

The Chancellor’s comments came in an interview on Tuesday, but were only published yesterday. In the intervening period, both the US and Germany have warned Britain against holding a referendum on Europe.

On Wednesday, US assistant secretary for European affairs Philip Gordon said the Obama administration wanted ‘a strong British voice’ in the EU and warned that referendums risked turning countries ‘inward’.

The following day a key ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a sharp warning that any attempt at ‘blackmailing’ member states into accepting change would backfire on Britain.

Bundestag European affairs committee chairman Gunther Krichbaum said a referendum could leave the UK isolated  in Europe.

A Treasury aide insisted that Mr Osborne’s comments were fully consistent with the Government’s position – that the EU needs to change ‘and indeed is changing’.

Downing Street yesterday said that Mr Cameron had talked Barack Obama through Britain’s approach to Europe when they spoke before Christmas, and that the US president was supportive.

‘We want to change our  relationship with the EU and seek consent on that,’ the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said.

Britain is on the brink of an unprecedented triple-dip recession after experts suggested that the economy had gone into reverse at the end of last year.

It shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of 2012, according to the think-tank National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).

Another three months of decline at the start of 2013 – seen as a serious threat given forecasts of freezing weather and heavy snow – would result in a third recession in five years. A recession is defined as two or more quarters of decline in a row.

‘A triple-dip recession remains a possibility,’ said Victoria Clarke, an economist at City firm Investec.Britain is trapped in the longest downturn on record and the economy is still 3.4 per cent smaller than it was at its peak in 2008 when boom gave way to bust. ‘We do not expect output to pass its peak of early 2008 until 2014,’ said Simon Kirby, an economist at NIESR. That would mean a six-year slump in the wake of the meltdown of the banking system in 2008.

NIESR said its prediction of a 0.3 per cent fall in output between October and December meant there was no growth at all in 2012. The think-tank is forecasting growth of 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2013, meaning Britain avoids a triple-dip. But Mr Kirby said: ‘Growth was absent in 2012 and the concern for 2013 is a continuation of no growth.’

The Office for National Statistics will give official figures for the fourth quarter of 2012 on January 25. Yesterday it said manufacturing output and construction fell in November.
