In another, a gun lies on a fan of $20 bills for the theme 'Guns in Black & White'.

In another dramatic photograph, a semi-automatic heavy machine gun and belt feed rests on a Polish flag and camouflage material.

Other images show weapons next to household items such as toasters, dishwashers and on Poker tables.

Followers can win prizes from gun shops, which are keen to share in the web page's popularity.

Chris's follower numbers increased dramatically from 8,500 after the Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre prompted a fierce debate about gun laws.

Chris, 42, from Florida, who has not revealed his surname for fear of reprisals from anti-gun activists, has collected weapons legally for the past 20 years.

He bought the first weapon at a gun show in Virginia and said he is fascinated by the history of his collection.

@Gun_Collector had 8,500 followers on the photo-sharing site Instagram before the December mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary bolstered calls for tougher firearms laws

He says his Instagram page, launched last summer, encourages people not to fear guns but critics say it glorifies weapons.

Chris told Yahoo News: 'It is an inanimate 
object. Itâ€™s people behind the guns that have ill intentions that are 
what you need to watch out for.'

He denied being a 'gun nut' and said he enjoys sharing is passion with people.

Ladd Everitt, spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said the collection of images were 'pretty run-of-the-mill gun porn.'

Debates on whether to tighten gun laws in the U.S. have polarised the country. 

Chris said he bought the first weapon at a gun show in Virginia and said he is fascinated by the history of his collection

About 70,000 people attended the National Rifle Association's annual convention last week after Senate failed to pass a bipartisan gun control bill.

However, recent polls have shown that the majority of Americans are in favour of both background checks and a national gun owner data base.

Chris's collection includes automatic weapons similar to those used in the Sandy Hook massacre.

He has 15 AK-47s and Eastern Bloc snip rifles

Chris, who stores his collection of weapons in four safes at his home, said he feels strongly about the Second Amendment and wants to education people on guns.

He told Yahoo News: 'I do feel strongly about the Second Amendment and what it means for the country. I try to educate people about what is right and what is wrong.'
