Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has criticised his World Cup hopefuls after a training session which he said 'did not please me at all.'

The hosts take on Panama in their penultimate World Cup tune-up on Tuesday ahead of their final friendly with Serbia on Friday and Scolari said he was resting skipper Thiago Silva, Fernandinho and Paulinho.

Of the training session on Sunday which had so displeased him, Scolari said: 'I did not like training, I liked nothing. Everything was wrong.'

The man who led Brazil to the 2002 World Cup told Globo television the players appeared too loose for his liking just a week-and-a-half before their first group match against Croatia in Sao Paulo.

'When I don't like things, I have to find a solution and field it on the pitch until I am satisfied,' said Scolari.

The training session saw the first-choice XI beat the reserves 3-2 with Neymar on target for the former in front of watching actress girlfriend Bruna Marquezine.

Marquezine attracted much attention despite wearing a large hat and sunglasses as she happily signed autographs.

On his decision to leave Silva, Fernandinho and Paulinho out of the Panama test, Scolari had earlier explained that Paris Saint-Germain's Silva is 'undergoing recovery work on his legs' as he gets over a niggling injury.

'We have two friendlies and it is preferable to field him in either better or perfect conditions from the second match,' Scolari told Fox Sports.
