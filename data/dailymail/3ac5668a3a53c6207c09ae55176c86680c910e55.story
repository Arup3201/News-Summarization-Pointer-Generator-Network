BBC News has marked Chinese New Year by welcoming viewers into the ‘year of the whores’.

A subtitling error spotted by many viewers on Friday evening on the hour at around 7pm saw the channel declare: ‘Welcome to the year of the whores. People around the globe celebrate.’

The mistake happened during the bulletin being presented by Rajesh Mirchandani. But the BBC insisted tonight that the error was acknowledged and quickly corrected - to the 'year of the horse’.

The fault was first spotted by copywriter Rebecca Hunter, of south-west London, who said on Twitter: 'The subtitles on BBC News just informed me that it's now the Chinese year of the whores...’

Adam Heasman, of Sheerness, Kent, added: 'Apparently BBC subtitles think we have entered the Chinese Year of the Whores... #Giggidy' - referencing hypersexual Family Guy character Quagmire.

Like all animals in the Chinese zodiac, the horse sign comes imbued with characteristics, such as vitality, loyalty and adventure. The year of the horse is generally considered an auspicious time.

Previous mistakes with the BBC subtitling system over the years include it calling the Labour leader ‘Ed Miller Band’ and the Church of England leader the ‘arch bitch of Canterbury’.

The bizarre gaffes are understood to be caused during live events where either a stenographer types words phonetically or by speech recognition.

This sees a person talking into a microphone as they observe the broadcast and a computer then changes what they are saying to subtitles.

Three years ago, the BBC came under fire from groups for the hard of hearing for an increasing number of errors. During the Queen Mother’s funeral in 2002, a solemn call for silence became ‘we will now have a moment’s violence’.

And when a BBC announcer revealed the Government was ‘making helpful decisions’, deaf viewers would have been left wondering why politicians were ‘making holes for surgeons’.

A BBC spokesman said at the time in October 2011: ‘Mistakes will happen, but we do all we can to keep this to a minimum and are constantly striving to improve accuracy.’
