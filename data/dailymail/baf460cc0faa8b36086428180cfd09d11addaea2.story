Mohammed Merah killed three schoolchildren, a rabbi and three paratroopers

Arabic TV network Al-Jazeera has said it will not air disturbing footage of the Toulouse shootings after the video was sent to its office in Paris.

It appeared to have been recorded during Mohammed Merah's deadly attacks on soldiers and a Jewish school earlier this month.

The station's decision not to broadcast the video, which was sent on a USB memory stick along with a letter, came after French president Nicolas Sarkozy and family of the victims had asked for it not to be shown.

The video has been edited into a 'montage' accompanied by an Islamic war songs, and was sent in a package post-dated March 21 - the day before 23-year-old Merah was killed by French special forces in his home city.

Investigators have already confirmed that Merah had a small video camera strapped to his chest when he murdered a Rabbi and his two children, as well as a teenage pupil, at a Jewish school in Toulouse a week ago.

The week before, the self-confessed 'Jihad warrior' also filmed his murders of three French soldiers who had fought in Afghanistan.

Both Al-Jazeera and Le Parisien newspaper confirmed that the video footage had been seen in Paris.

An unnamed source in Le Parisien, Paris's daily newspaper, said: 'Investigators are trying to find out whether the letter was posted Tuesday night by Mohamed Merah himself or by an accomplice on Wednesday morning.'

The existence of an accomplice would end theories that Merah was a 'lone wolf' assassin who acted out of his hatred for the 'enemies' of Islam, and especially Jews.

On Sunday his brother, Abdelkader Merah, 29, appeared before an anti-terrorist judge in Parisand was formally charged with 'complicity in murder'.

Abdelkader was remanded in custody, and taken to a high-security prison in Paris, where he is likely to remain until his trial.

Adbelkader has already told police 
interrogators that he was 'very proud' of what Merah did, and admitted 
to dinning with him just before the attack on the Ozar Hatorah school in
 Toulouse.

'Signals from Abdelkader's mobile 
phone were emitted close to the school at the time of the murders,' said
 an investigating source.

Among numerous questions Abedelkader 
is facing is why traces of explosive were found in his car, and how much
 he knew about the arsenal of weapons his brother was storing.

Victims: Imad Ibn-Ziaten, 30, Abel Chennouf, 25, and Mohamed Legouade, 26 were killed by Merah last week

It is also believed that Abdekkader 
also helped his brother buy the Yamaha T-Max motorbike used in all the 
attacks, and to respray the vehicle and to try and remove its tracking 
device.

Paris security sources believe that 
both Merah brothers were involved in two local Islamist organisations, 
Forsane Alizza (The Knights of Pride) and a more militant jihadist 
network known as the Toulouse group, or Jund al-Khalifah.

Jund al-Khalifah, an Al-Qaeda splinter
 group, has already admitted to working with a 'Youssef the Frenchman' -
 who is believed to be Merah.

The French authorities are facing 
growing criticism that Merah, a known fundamentalist who was on the U.S.
 no-fly list and had attended an al-Qaeda training camp, was left alone 
to carry out his crimes.
