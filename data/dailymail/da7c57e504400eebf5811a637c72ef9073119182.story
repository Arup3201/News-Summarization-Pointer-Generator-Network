If this was a different era, Robin van Persie might be reaching for the hair dye, but it’s not so easy to pull wool over the eyes when it comes to age and decline these days.

Not in the time of statistics. As a device they are overused, as vividly explained by Fatih Terim, the inimitable manager of Turkey, who tends to say: ‘Statistics are like mini-skirts - they don't reveal everything.’

But what they verify in this instance is the first-hand impressions of a sublime player on the slide. At 31 years old, the other numbers in this equation are not looking nearly as convincing as they once did.

Robin van Persie has come in for some criticism following a drop in form for Manchester United this season

A struggling Van Persie gets a shellacking from the Arsenal supporters as he struggles to stamp his authority 

More than that, the statistics drawn from each of the 2012-13, 13-14 and 14-15 seasons, hint broadly at decline across a range of significant indicators.

A striker who seemed indispensable when reunited with Louis van Gaal in the summer suddenly seems out of place and ineffective in Manchester United’s frontline. With Radamel Falcao back in training and apparently fit, how much longer will he hold down a place?

Beyond immediate selection decisions, how much longer will he be wanted at the club? Inter Milan are keen to welcome him to the slower realm of Serie A next summer, when The Dutchman will have a year remaining on his £250,000-a-week contract and could go for £10m. 

With a £10m loyalty bonus also believed to exist in his contract, United will have extra incentive to sell a striker who only two seasons ago was the difference between success and failure in Sir Alex Ferguson’s final campaign.

It seems like a stark fall, but the statistic that showed he only touched the ball 13 times in the win over Arsenal is not alone in suggesting the effects of time and injuries on his game.

The basic frontline numbers do only some of the damage, showing he has scored just three Premier League goals in 11 games and has contributed no assists. Last season those numbers were 12 and three and in 2012-13 he managed 26 and nine.

As Tottenham goalkeeper Michel Vorm, a Holland team-mate, told Sportsmail last season: ‘I have never seen a player with such a versatile game. He is a complete team player – so much more than goals.’

That has rarely looked the case this season. But the numbers of greater concern show that over the past three seasons focus on the rate at which he produces. Whereas in 2012-13 he scored every 120 minutes on average and a season later was managing one goal every 132 minutes, that rate has slipped to a strike every 307 minutes.

In 2012-13, that ratio of goals per minute was the fourth best in the division among players who scored 10 or more. In 2013-14, he was fifth for the same criteria. This season, of players who have scored three or more, he ranks 37th out of 39, with only Raheem Sterling and Morgan Schneiderlin behind him.

An assist used to come every 347 minutes under Ferguson and every 528 last season. There have been none in the Premier League under Van Gaal.

And having managed an average of 3.4 shots per game in 2012-13 and 2.61 last season, it is now down to 2.15. His shots on target have followed the same pattern, as have his touches, which went from an average of 47.5 per game in Ferguson’s final season to 32.67 in this campaign.

Of the indicators studied, only Van Persie’s shooting accuracy of 59 per cent this season is better now than it was in his first United season.

It’s a long way removed the influence Van Persie used to hold over this division. Is it the end? Are such predictions premature?

The next few months will offer more detailed and anecdotal clues, but the numbers currently don’t make pleasant reading.
