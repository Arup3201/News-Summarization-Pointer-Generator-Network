A mechanic has been found guilty of stabbing his ex-lover, who was also his stepdaughter, to death in a jealous rage after discovering she was in a new relationship.

Simon Meecham, 43, launched a 'determined, focussed and wholly unprovoked attack' on 26-year-old Leanne Meecham at her home in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, in February.

Meecham, who had been married to Miss Meecham's mother Jane before embarking on the six-year relationship in 2007, attacked her the day before Valentine’s Day after hearing she had a new partner.

Today, a jury of eight women and four men found him guilty of murder following a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court.

During the trial, Jocelyn Ledward, prosecuting, told the court that Meecham had been driven by 'possessiveness and jealousy of the fact she was moving on with her life'.

He bombarded the victim with phone calls begging her to take him back before telling her that 'if he could not have her, nobody else could'.

Police were called to Miss Meecham’s home at around 8.30am on February 13 this year, where she was found with multiple stab wounds.

She was immediately airlifted to the Royal London Hospital, but later died from her injuries.

Meecham then fled across Southend-on-Sea in Essex before he was arrested and taken to hospital under police guard for treatment of self-inflicted knife wounds.

In court, he had attempted to claim that he had stabbed his stepdaughter by accident but the jury refused to believe his lies and found him guilty of murder.

'Leanne Meecham was much loved by her 
family and was a devoted mother,' said Senior Investigating Officer DCI 
Mark Hall, from the Kent & Essex Serious Crime Directorate.

'On the morning of February 13, Simon Meecham went to Leanne’s home armed with a knife.

'He had discovered that she had started a new relationship and he was consumed by jealousy.

'Shortly after he arrived he fatally wounded Leanne, stabbing her multiple times.

'She was totally defenceless against what was a determined, focussed and wholly unprovoked attack.

'My thoughts are with Leanne’s family and I hope that his conviction brings them some small comfort.

'This tragic case illustrates the dangers faced by those who suffer violence and abuse within their homes.'

After the verdict, Miss Meecham's family paid tribute to the 'precious' young mother.

'In February our family lost our precious Leanne at the hands of Simon Meecham.

'She was a special sister, daughter, mother and friend.

'The past six months have been especially hard for us as we struggle to come to terms with how Leanne was taken from us.

'Despite the conviction of her killer, his term of imprisonment will never be sufficient punishment for taking Leanne from us.

'We will now try to move on with our lives, remembering Leanne and the wonderful times that we shared.'

Meecham, from Shoeburyness, Essex, is due to be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court on Friday.
