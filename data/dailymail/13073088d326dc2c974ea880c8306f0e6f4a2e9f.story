The family of a pregnant woman injected with heroin, raped and killed is suing over her death.

Filed Monday in Ohio, the lawsuit holds former doctor Ali Salim, the hospital he used to work for and Craigslist accountable for Deanna Ballman’s death, and is seeking $40million in damages.

Mr. Salim has been charged in connection with the death of both the 23-year-old expectant mother and her unborn child.

Dead: Deanna Ballman died from a heroin overdose, her body was found on the side of a rural Ohio road

A tragedy: Two young children will grow up without their mother, and a third child died before it was even born

The website should have known Mr. Salim was a danger to women after numerous complaints were made to both local police – who notified the site of the danger he posed – and directly to the site by abused women, according to the suit.

‘Craigslist was on notice and knew or should have known defendant Ali Salim was inherently dangerous to its Internet users,’ the suit said.

Multiple women answering ads placed by the former doctor accused him of sexual assault, and even to be alone with him in the house while he painted the human digestive system on their abdomens, according to the suit.

The accused killer’s employer, Knox Community Hospital, is also being held liable in Ms. Ballman’s death. The suit accuses the hospital of negligence for allegedly allowing Mr. Salim to take the needles he is said to have used to inject the deceased mother with heroin, as well as not keeping adequate track of the narcotics being taken.

Not a cleaning ad: Authorities have now said that Ms. Ballman answered a personal ad posted on Craigslist, not a cleaning ad as was originally reported

Accused killer: Dr. Ali Salim pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, kidnapping, rape and assault

The suit also tried to accuse a third party of helping Mr. Salim inject Ms. Ballman with heroin, but authorities have not been able to prove that accusation.

Discovered dead August 1, 2012 on the side of a road in rural Ohio, Ms. Ballman is said to have been alive when Mr. Salim allegedly dumped her body after injecting her in the leg with heroin and raping her.

Mr. Salim has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, rape and assault charges, as well as two counts of murder – one each for Ms. Ballman and for her unborn daughter she planned to name Mabel Lilly. Ms. Ballman was nine months pregnant when she died.

Horrific: Ms. Ballman's 19-year-old brother was petitioning to take custody of her children - until he was shot dead earlier this year

So sad: Ms. Ballman left behind two young children

Originally reported to have been responding to a housecleaning ad on Craigslist, authorities now say Ms. Ballman was replying to a personal ad on the site.

Mr. Salim’s lawyer has accused the deceased mother of prostituting herself to support her drug habit. Authorities have disputed this claim, saying there is no evidence to suggest Ms. Ballman was a drug user.

The deceased mother also had two other young children that her 19-year-old brother James Ballman was peititioning for custody of until he was shot dead in February.
