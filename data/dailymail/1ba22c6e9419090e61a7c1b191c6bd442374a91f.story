Sir Joshua Reynolds' portrait of Omai was exempt from capital gains tax because it was used in the business of opening the house to the public

The owners of multi-million-pound art treasures may be able to class their paintings as worthless to escape hefty tax bills after a landmark ruling.

The aristocratic Howard family successfully argued that a painting they sold for £9.4 million was part of ‘plant and machinery’ at their stately home and therefore a ‘wasting asset’ exempt from capital gains tax (CGT).

The family said the picture by 18th Century English painter Sir Joshua Reynolds had been put on display to attract visitors and so was declining in value for tax purposes.

Wealthy aristocrats, nightclub owners and high-end restaurant chains are all eyeing the new tax break that could save them millions of pounds when they sell treasured collectors’ items.

The painting – a depiction of Omai, a South Sea Islander who spent two years in England in the 1770s after being picked up by Captain Cook’s ship Adventure – was sold at Sotheby’s in 2001.

The Howards, whose Yorkshire home was the setting for ITV’s 1981 adaptation of Evelyn Waugh’s classic Brideshead Revisited, had been arguing with the taxman ever since. But this month’s Upper Tax Tribunal judgment determined that there was no CGT due on the sale of the painting.

 Mr Justice Morgan said: ‘I accept that there is something surprising in holding that an asset of high value, and one liable to appreciate in value, with a predicted life of more than 50 years, was a wasting asset.

‘However, the painting was only a wasting asset because it satisfied the established test.’

HM Revenue & Customs had argued that if famous paintings could be treated as plant, it would create a huge loophole for tax avoidance.

Officials are now considering the judgment. Accountants are equally interested in the details. ‘We will be raising it with our clients, many of whom have valuable paintings,’ said Mike Warburton, a tax adviser at accountancy firm Grant Thornton.

‘People will be looking to locate artwork where it is a part of their business.’

Mr Warburton said the ruling could have wide implications. ‘Supposing somebody bought a Jimi Hendrix guitar. If you hang it on the wall of your nightclub, it’s there for the ambience,’ he said.

That would mean it would not be subject to CGT. Individuals usually pay up to 28 per cent tax on any gain they have made when selling valuable items.

It is not clear how much CGT the Howard family will avoid through the ruling. The painting was acquired by Frederick Howard, the 5th Earl of Carlisle, in the 1790s.

Mr Warburton said the case showed that tax rules are a muddle. ‘The painting was not caught for capital gains tax because it was treated as a wasting asset.

'A valuable painting is almost certainly going to survive for more than 50 years and rise in value. The lawyers were successful in arguing that the painting was “plant”. Few people would think a painting was plant.’

A spokesman for the Howard family said: ‘For many years the painting had been on display to visitors.

The judge held that Omai had been ‘‘plant’’ used in the business of opening the house to the public. It therefore qualified for exemption from capital gains tax when sold.’
