Penny pincher: Ariel Castro, pictured in his latest mugshot, so tight with money he would split McDonald's burgers in half with his own family

The man who allegedly kept three girls captive for a decade was so controlling with his first wife that he told her what to eat, who she could be friends with and when she could leave the house.

Ariel Castro was 'obsessive' about ordering around Grimilda Figueroa to the point where he once demanded that she get into a cardboard box and only come out when he said so.

He told her to wear skirts below the knee and vowed to kill her if she ever left him - so  she stayed by his side despite the abuse.

Grimilda died last year due to injuries which her family claim were caused by Ariel.

He allegedly beat her so badly that she suffered two broken noses, shattered ribs and a blood clot on the brain.

She was also left with a knocked-out tooth and two dislocated shoulders from the domestic abuse, according to a 2005 court filing.

Speaking to MailOnline, Grimilda's sister Elida Caraballo, 44, said: 'My sister would be alive today if it wasn't for him.

'If I could talk to him I wouldn't even talk to him. Words can't even explain what I feel inside.

'It's hatred, he's not even worth being called a father'.

Elida said that Ariel and her sister met because they lived across the road from each other and that a week later they were dating.

They moved into an apartment in the family home in Cleveland, but trouble began soon after the birth of her first son Anthony.

Elida said: 'He became controlling.

'That's when everything started going downhill, the day she had Anthony.

'He told her she couldn't wear short skirts and that they had to be below the knee. They were like 1920s dresses.

'He said she couldn't go anywhere. He was controlling. She never had friends.

'She would never disobey him. She was only allowed to talk to the family.'

Asked the significance of having a child, Elida said: 'I think having a child is more, you're mine. As a tie down kind of thing. You can't do this, you can't do that.

'He can control her even more. He was obsessed about control, he was always obsessive about having control.

'He became abusive, first he started pushing her then he hit her.'

Elida recounted one instance that was particularly harrowing.

She said: 'After she had Anthony he pushed her in a box, I don't know why. He pushed the flaps and told her: 'You stay in there until I tell you to get out.'

'When I went downstairs to tell my family he told Grimilda to get out. 

'She got pregnant with (her second child of five) Angie and everything was OK but he was still controlling towards her.'

Elida said that her sister stayed with Ariel 'because he said he would kill her if she left.'

She said: 'It was for the kids. She would not leave for all those kids.

'When we used to visit her she would say she can't leave the porch or Ariel will kill her.

'She tried to leave. She feared him. If he tried to leave he would take the kids away or kill her.'
