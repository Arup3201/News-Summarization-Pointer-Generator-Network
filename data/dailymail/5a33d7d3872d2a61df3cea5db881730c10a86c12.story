Sgt Steven Little told The Columbus Dispatch that the family's two Shiba Inus didn't appear to have attacked the baby, but rather were playing with her.

Little said the girl had been on the couch with her father an apparently fell to the floor as her father slept.

Police say the girl had been born prematurely and was brought home from the hospital around Thanksgiving. They're calling her death an accident.

Columbus police say it doesn't appear the parents will be charged county prosecutors will review the case.
