Darren Feldman is set to receive a substantial five-figure sum after a tribunal agreed his position at HCA International had become intolerable

A worker claims that his boss said he wanted to lock up 'Yids' like Apprentice star Lord Sugar's son and gas them and wore obscene t-shirts mocking Jewish football fans.

Darren Feldman, 33, said that manager Chris Oates also mocked him by inviting him to JuJu, a champagne bar on London's King's Road.

Mr Oates allegedly talked about taunting Jewish Tottenham fans by running past the club's White Hart Lane stadium wearing an Arsenal top with 'IVOR 4 SKIN' printed on the back.

Giving evidence, Mr Feldman, who is Jewish, said that on his boss's birthday the pair discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar, son of Apprentice star and former Tottenham chairman Lord Sugar.

Mr Oates is alleged to have said: 'I'm just messing them around. Quite frankly they're all a bunch of Yids. I'd like to lock them in the building and gas them all'.

Qualified surveyor Mr Feldman was a £47,500-a-year construction project manager for private hospital group HCA International.

He is suing the firm at Central London employment tribunal for race and religious discrimination, harassment and constructive dismissal.

Mr Feldman's solicitor Shilpen Savani said: 'The allegations made by Mr Feldman are very serious.

'This case has been brought because Mr Feldman ultimately felt that he had no option but to leave his employment.'

American firm HCA is the world's largest private hospital group. Its London hospitals include the Portland, Princess Grace, Wellington, Lister, London Bridge and University College Hospital’s private ‘Harley Street’ wing

Mr Feldman, of Teddington, south-west London, said that within a month of joining the firm in April last year he mentioned to colleagues that he is Jewish.

He alleged that director of estates and projects Mr Oates, who is not Jewish, called him into his office.

Mr Feldman told the tribunal: 'Chris asked me what I thought of the idea of his to run down White Hart Lane wearing an Arsenal football top with the writing 'IVOR 4 SKIN' on the back. He wrote it out on a piece of scrap paper.

'This was a derogatory and offensive reference to the fact that Tottenham Hotspur Football Club is known to have a large contingent of Jewish supporters.

'I did not know how to answer that question as I was shocked and offended.'

Mr Feldman alleged that on his boss's birthday the pair discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar, son of Apprentice star Lord Sugar, when Mr Oates made the remarks

Mr Feldman said that his tormentor then looked up bar JuJu on an iPad and showed him the search results.

He recalled: 'Chris then asked if I wanted to go to a club after work which is located along Kings Road called JuJu.

'He pointed his finger at me saying 'want to go JuJu, Juju?' repeating it several times in an intimidating manner.'

He added: 'Chris was not only a bully in the way that he treated me but he was also seriously abusive towards me because I was Jewish.'

Mr Feldman said that Mr Oates moved him without warning from HCA's office in central London to the Portland Hospital and began calling him by his surname.

Mr Feldman told a tribunal that he felt that his position had been made intolerable

He said: 'It was increasingly obvious to me that he disliked my presence in the office.

'I am convinced all of this negativity towards me was influenced by his dislike for me due to the fact that I was a Jew. I found it humiliating and upsetting.'

In September last year, Mr Feldman was at a restaurant with Mr Oates when a black diner entered.

This allegedly prompted Mr Oates to make the racist remark 'Feldman, do you want your boots polished?'

In October last year, HCA's construction team were celebrating Mr Oates' birthday in a Marylebone bar.

Mr Feldman said: 'I spoke to him about possibly renting Fitzroy House, located along Euston Road, and liaising with Daniel Sugar, the son of Lord Alan Sugar the owner.

'He replied with words to the effect: 'I'm just messing them around. Quite frankly they're all a bunch of Yids. I'd like to lock them in the building and gas them all'.

'I was in disbelief. I was even more disturbed because Chris knew I was Jewish and would find the remark particularly offensive due to the Holocaust.

'He either did not care about this or, even more worryingly, said it deliberately to hurt and offend me.

'I finished my drink and left soon afterwards.'

Lord Sugar, 66, was born into a Jewish family in Hackney, east London.

His property company Amsprop - managed by his 41-year-old son Daniel - holds most of his £800 million wealth and owns a string of London offices.

Four days later, the manager allegedly told Mr Feldman he did not see him 'fitting into the business in the future'.

In response, Mr Feldman quit his job. He told the tribunal: 'I felt that my position had been made intolerable and I did not wish to expose myself to any more abuse from Chris.

'It had become a very nasty and unpleasant place to work and I did not feel I could take any more.

'The decision to resign my employment with HCA was a very difficult one for me as I was giving up a very good salary and a really good job.

'However, I felt this was the only option available to me as I could not tolerate any more racist or religious abuse or bullying from Chris.

'I am also very saddened and disappointed that HCA has tolerated such racist and bullying behaviour by a senior manager and has supported him throughout this case.

'I believe this is really very shameful and is not how any responsible employer should behave in this day and age.'

HCA and Mr Oates strenuously deny all Mr Feldman's allegations.

A HCA spokesperson said: 'It would be inappropriate for us to make comment on the case whilst it is sub judice other than to state that we refute his allegations.

'We have a clear code of conduct around acceptable, professional and ethical behaviour and take any claim of discrimination very seriously.'

The case continues.
