DIARY OF A MAD DIVA by Joan Rivers (Berkley £18.99)

Might Joan Rivers be a little hard on herself? So old that ‘Abe Lincoln and I were an item,’ she says. And so ugly that ‘Cupid saw me naked and shot an arrow into his own head’.

She reckons she never appealed to men — ‘not even my husband’, who committed suicide. To bring about a radical improvement, she has undergone compulsive plastic surgery — in this diary, she is always off to hospital, for a brow-lift, tummy tuck, chin job, lip implant, or what her doctors call ‘the usual’.

She realises, however, that you can’t change in essence what you are — and what Joan is, essentially, beyond an 80-year-old clown with boundless mad energy, is a great and abrasive New Yorker, who, in the streets of Manhattan on an average morning is used to being shoved and banged into and told to ‘go f*** myself’ in three different languages.

Joan Rivers is her own crazy creation, as funny and candid as ever reveals all in her new autobiography

She loves the cosmopolitanism of her city. She gets her pedicures from a Vietnamese sex slave, rides in taxis driven by Haitian ex-cons hiding from the police, and has Mexican servants who remind her of ‘Downton Abbey with sombreros’.

It is a characteristic of the professional curmudgeon that hands that could help her regularly get bitten.

Aggrieved she has never enjoyed a film career — if Hollywood wants a ‘mean, humpbacked Jew’, for some unaccountable reason ‘Jane Fonda always gets those roles’ — Joan has instead made a name for herself on cable television, mocking the celebrities who, in her estimation, are without exception ‘drug addicts, shoplifters or closet cases’.

Pretty actresses and models, in Joan’s eyes, are bulimic twits who meet their ‘tweaked-out gay agents’ at hangouts such as The Ivy to discuss business ‘over scrambled egg whites they don’t eat’. All such sorts do in the first-class cabin on a plane is lock themselves in the lavatory, purging and vomiting.

Then, they go and buy African children, whom they will love ‘until they reach puberty and the problems start’.

Joan is gloriously scornful about the famous. Mia Farrow is ‘that psychotic bitch’. Style, to Aretha Franklin, meant trying to look impressive ‘while sweating mayonnaise through 60 yards of organza’.

Joan reveals she began to have plastic surgery on her face when she realised men didn't find her attractive

Stars who give their offspring silly names get especially short shrift. In a sentence that made me laugh out loud, Joan says: ‘I always wanted to ask Gwyneth Paltrow, “Does Apple have worms?” ’

If little gives Joan more pleasure than watching ‘narcissistic actors pretending to be happy for someone else’ when they fail to win at an awards show, it would not be true to say that ordinary folk are immune from her wrath.

Indeed, Joan’s disdain is democratically sprinkled about. ‘Why should blind people have apartments with park views?’ she asks, reasonably.

Fussy eaters are an irritation — the ones who keep going through the menu, fretting, ‘Is there alcohol in tiramisu? Is there rum in rum cake?’

Self-pity annoys her enormously, as victims can be weirdly competitive about their rock-bottom moments: ‘I was drunk and raped by a gang of 12. It was a horrible moment. Four of them were Japanese and poorly endowed.’

Generally, Joan’s complaints are entirely justifiable. She resents having to pay taxes to fund ‘some teenage mother in Houston with five kids by seven different baby daddies’. Joan loathes waiters who say ‘no problem’, or ‘no worries’, when all you want is a cup of decaf. She gets steamed up with the stupidity of bookshop assistants — when she requested Paul Anka’s autobiography, she was asked, in all seriousness, ‘Who’s the author?’

She can’t abide it that television now panders only to audiences so idiotic, none can spell ‘mom’ backwards. Interviewers, too, are morons, incapable of deviating from their set list of questions. If you say, ‘I killed my mother’, they’ll ask, ‘I understand you like shoes?’

Joan is against the trend for audience participation, for example, Diana Ross wanting people to join in the chorus. ‘How did singing suddenly become my job? When I’m in Vegas, I don’t make my audience hold hands and tell the jokes.’

The popular comedienne always wanted a career as a Hollywood film star

It’s as bizarre a development as supermarkets suddenly deciding it’s green not to have shopping bags, which reminds Joan of restaurants without plates. ‘What do you do? Have the chef throw the food in your mouth?’

That’s a typical Joan syllogism. She pounces on small-scale annoyances and pumps them up until they are cosmic gripes, with surreal twists. ‘If you stutter,’ she counsels, ‘don’t look for work on a suicide hotline. D-d-d-d-don’t j-j-j-jump! Too late!’

Joan Rivers is her own crazy creation, wonderfully lacking in sentimentality, propelled by a healthy rage against political correctness and any form of priggishness.

‘Happiness is a rich husband with three days to live,’ is a trade-mark pronouncement.

Half Mae West and half Dame Edna, she’s someone you wouldn't want to upset.

‘I hope she gets run over by a car driven by an uninsured driver, and the ambulance is stuck in traffic,’ is one of her average witch’s curses.

We must be grateful, in the end, for modern developments in police forensic techniques, as ‘in the good old days, you shot some son of a bitch, pressed the smoking gun into his hand and got away with it’.

Nowadays, what with DNA, high-tech sprays that show up blood, crumb analysis, carpet fibres and so forth, ‘there’s just no way a nice person like me can get away with murdering someone who really annoys me’.

I know exactly how she feels. Every good joke told is a homicide averted.
