With Bryan May, the RSPCA and Bill Oddie among the people and organisations lining up to attack it, news of the Government's badger culling scheme proved controversial to say the least.

But in one Somerset village, the culls proved nothing short of disastrous with one animal rights obsessed resident's poster campaign resulting in a horde of activists descending on the tiny hamlet.

One young family was even forced to move away after being wrongly linked to the cull by neighbour Meg Sunningdale, 67, and subjected to a barrage of abuse.

Outrage: Meg Sunningdale infuriated neighbours when her poster campaign led to a family being driven out

Noise: Her campaign also resulted in rowdy animal rights activists setting up camp in the village

But despite the dramatic repercussions, Mrs Sunningdale is unrepentant and says that as far as she's concerned, saving badgers is more important than the wellbeing of her neighbours.

'When we moved in, we were really 
excited,' says Mrs Sunningdale, who moved to the village of Withycombe with her husband eight years ago.

'We're here in this lovely valley with woods, trees, open land, 
this wonderful stream... It's just this wonderful environment.

'I had no 
idea what to expect when I arrived because I've never lived in a small 
village before but I did come in with a lot of enthusiasm.'

But Mrs Sunningdale, a self-described 'spokesperson' for animals soon began to make enemies; loudly forcing her views on reluctant neighbours.

'You've got to be very careful about what you say in a small place like this because you could upset people,' explains long-term resident, Bill Calloway.

'When I met Meg for the first time, I thought she was a very interfering old lady.'

Mrs Sunningdale's animal rights campaign began innocently enough with fairs to raise money for the RSPCA and a local dog show.

But soon, she incurred the wrath of locals after treating them to her views on people who walk their dogs in fields where pheasants are nesting.

'I was standing by my house and there was
 a gentleman up the road and he was walking his dogs in the field,' remembers the unrepentant Mrs Sunningdale.

'It 
was pheasant breeding time and there were youngsters running around, and
 when I saw him in the field, I thought, "What are you doing? He can't let his dog do that."

'A person walking is bad enough but a dog 
running around ground nesting birds and chicks is worse. [The dog] was chasing them around, the pheasants were flying up and I couldn't 
help myself - I didn't think, I just shouted.'

Upset: Neighbour Tony Connolly was left furious after being kept awake by animal rights activists

Hub: Somerset was one of the test areas used for the first Government badger cull last summer

'She was regarded rightly or wrongly as a
 bit of a nutter with regards to animal welfare sort of thing,' adds neighbour Tony Connolly.

'But she 
did take it to extremes. To come and live in a rural, small, farming 
village and then expect people not to do things in the country that they
 do - why would you want to go and live in the middle of it?'

When the badger culls were mooted, and Mrs Sunnindale discovered that a neighbour was planning to take part, her one-woman animal rights campaign took a dangerous turn.

Mrs Sunningdale, who had already irritated neighbours by leaving sandwiches and other food in her garden for badgers to eat, created a series of posters 'naming and shaming' her neighbour which she then attached to her gate and posted around the village.

'I just couldn't believe that he would be part of a badger cull and my natural instinct was to name and shame this person,' she explains.

Protest: Mrs Sunningdale joined noisy animal rights activists protesting about the badger cull in the village

Furious: Animal rights activists descended on Withypool following Mrs Sunningdale's poster campaign

'People
 who were shooting badgers didn't want anyone to know and I don't think 
that's right. I think they should be prepared to tell people.'

But when a national newspaper picked up the story, the results were disastrous. Not only did the neighbour named on her posters receive a deluge of abusive phone calls and emails, he became so scared, he and his family felt they had no option but to move.

'I couldn't believe that someone would be that stupid - to do something like that is unbelievable,' adds Mr Connolly.

'I know he was getting abusive phonecalls, emails - they had all his 
contact details. It was non-stop.

'He was that frightened for his family, his wife and children, he moved his family out of the village. He was frightened for his family all 
because Meg had put those posters up.'

Mrs Sunningdale, however, is unrepentant. 'I think badgers were a greater priority to me than being part of the community,' she remembers.

'I didn't feel bad about the phone calls 
they were receiving. I thought that's a bit more ammunition. I didn't 
feel any remorse at all.'

Camp: The protesters set up camp in a copse just yards from the villagers, keeping them up most of the night

No remorse: Despite forcing a family out of the village, Mrs Sunningdale says she isn't sorry for what she did

Next, thanks to the publicity generated by Mrs Sunningdale's poster campaign, a horde of animal rights activists descended on the village, setting up camp in a copse 100 yards from her neighbour's homes.

'They had no worry about shining 
spotlights in all of our windows,' adds Mr Connolly. 'They didn't usually start until about 
2.30 in the morning - just enough to let you get to sleep.

'They started 
off with the lights, whistles, air horns. I don't need them out there 
keeping me awake at night. I don't know what they were trying to 
achieve. But what they did achieve was p***sing us off here.'

'My response to people complaining about noise in the village would be what about the noise the shooters have been making?' sniffs Mrs Sunningdale.

Matters deteriorated further when her neighbours, enraged by her behaviour, responded by calling the police and, in one case, by leaving a bag of manure in her garden.

'We
 were spotted by a shooter on his way home and he stopped, reversed and 
shone a huge light on us,' explains Mrs Sunningdale.

Support: Brian May was among celebrities who voiced opposition to badger culling

'I said
 to him, "You're an absolute scumbag!" and he didn't say a word, just drove 
on. The next day I had three bags of dog excrement in my garden. I 
thought, "Hmmm, what can I do with this?"'

Her solution was to return it to the person she assumed was responsible - with a nasty note attached.

'The
 note said, "If you feel the need to shoot living targets, maybe you 
ought to join the army,' she remembers, adding: 'Oh, wait, you would probably be too cowardly to 
be on the other end of a gun.'

This time, she received a caution from police and, with her relationship with her neighbours damaged beyond repair, plans to leave the village of Withypool behind.

'I don't know what reputation I had to start with but whatever I had was ruined and I certainly have a very bad reputation now,' she admits.

Neighbour Tony Connolly adds: Do I feel any sympathy for her? No I don't - she brought everything on herself.

'I don't think think it'll make any difference whatsoever except that I 
won't be able to say we've got a nutter living in the village anymore.'
