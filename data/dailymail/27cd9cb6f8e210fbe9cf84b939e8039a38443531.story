A New York woman admitted today that she faked cancer to con donors out of money and services for her wedding and Caribbean honeymoon.

Jessica Vega, 25, isn't likely to do any time in state prison, court officials said, but she will have to repay $13,368 to her victims and remain in jail until her sentencing on May 15.

She pleaded guilty in Orange County Court to scheming to defraud and possession of a forged instrument charges.

Charged: Jessica Vega, pictured in Orange County Court on Wednesday, pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud and possession of a forged instrument charges

In 2010, Vega spread the word in her 
Hudson Valley community that she was dying of leukemia and wanted a 
'dream wedding' to Michael O'Connell, the father of her infant daughter,
in the few months she had left.

Donors stepped up with rings, an 
embroidered wedding dress and a time-share in Aruba for the honeymoon. 
Other contributions included food, wine and hairdressing.

Vega was living in Montgomery, a town 
60 miles north of New York City, when she launched the scam, which 
picked up steam when her story was featured in a local newspaper, the 
Times Herald-Record of Middletown.

But after their May 2010 wedding, O'Connell came to the newspaper with questions about her story and the couple divorced.

The forged instrument charge involved a bogus doctor's letter that Vega gave the newspaper to bolster her story.

She was arrested April 3 in Virginia, where she was again living with O'Connell and their second child.

Vega is expected to be sentenced to time already served in jail as long as she pays the restitution.

'We're going to make that somehow,' said Vega's lawyer, Jeremiah Flaherty, adding that O'Connell will help pay back the victims.

'While he blew the whistle on her, at the same time this is the mother of his two children,' Flaherty said.

He said Vega is sorry for what 
happened and hopes the people who showed her kindness aren't 
disillusioned or less likely to help others in the future.

'She got caught up in something and it just got out of hand,' Flaherty said.

Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, 
whose office prosecuted the case, said the plea means Vega 'will be held
accountable for fleecing the public through lies and deception.'

'By pretending to have a terminal illness, Vega inexcusably took advantage of the community's hearts and minds,' he said.

Vega married Michael O'Connell, the 
father of her one-year-old daughter Lily, on May 2, 2010 and the couple 
spent an exotic honeymoon in Aruba using donated plane tickets and a 
villa.

The reception 
was attended by 60 family and friends who had all give money to the 
tragic cause along with many strangers who read about Vega's plight in 
their town newspaper in Newburgh, around 75 miles from New York City.

Friends donated everything from her dress to a two-week honeymoon in the
Caribbean so that the then 23-year-old could enjoy a happy start to married 
life before succumbing to the disease.

She reportedly received thousands of dollars and wedding presents.

Four months later, O'Connell revealed that Vega had been faking the illness and he had been duped into marrying her after she showed him a letter from her doctors with the grim diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia.

Within weeks of returning from their 
honeymoon O'Connell, a construction worker, noticed that his wife's 
condition had not deteriorated.

He telephoned the doctor's office to ask questions about her cancer only to be told Vega was not a patient at the surgery.

The letter she reportedly had obtained from a doctor in Westchester was a forgery.

The couple divorced over the 
deception and O'Connell moved to Virginia to find work. 

Vega initially denied making up the cancer story and said at the time that she and her husband separated because he was physically abusive.

The local newspaper reporter who wrote the initial report attempted to 
accompany Vega to see her doctor but she failed to turn up for the 
appointment.

Vega and O'Connell have since
reunited and had a second child. O'Connell, who at one time gave evidence to prosecute his wife, said that although she should repay those who were scammed, his wife needs mental health care and not prison.
