A Christian bakery that refused to make a lesbian couple a tiered wedding cake because it would violate their 'religious beliefs' has shut down after months of hate-mail and plummeting revenues.

Melissa and Aaron Klein have been driven out of their shop in Gresham, Oregon - and are taking operations back into their home - after they say they received death- and also rape-threats and saw client numbers fall following their decision not to serve a lesbian couple.

Media reports say they have been hounded by hate mail since January when Rachel Cryer and Laurel Bowman were refused service and subsequently made a discrimination complaint to authorities about the bakery.

Driven out: Bakery owners Aaron and Melissa Klein have closed their Gresham, Ore. bakery after being hounded by hate mail for refusing to serve a same-sex couple because they believe it would have violated their Christian values

The bakery owners said they would rather close than undermine their beliefs and they will continue operations from their home

On
Friday the bakers posted on their Facebook page: 'This will be our last
weekend at the shop we are moving our business to an in home bakery.'

According to The Blaze,
which saw some of the hate mail received by the bakers, one read: 'You 
stupid bible-thumping, hypocritical b**ch.  I hope your kids get really,
really, sick and you go out of business,' and another said: 'Here’s 
hoping you go out of business, you bigot. Enjoy hell.'

The
couple told the news service their customers had been 'badgered and 
harassed' not to do business with the bakery and subsequently, orders 
for wedding cakes this summer were significantly lower than usual.

Some clients even cancelled existing orders because of the public debacle, the Blaze said.

'It's discrimination': Newlyweds Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer, left to right, complained to the state when Sweet Cakes by Melissa refused to serve them based on their sexual orientation

Oregon's
Bureau of Labor and Industries' civil rights division is reviewing 
whether Sweet Cakes by Melissa discriminated against same-sex newlyweds 
Rachel and Laurel Bowman-Cryer based on their sexual orientation.

When
the decision was made public, Mr Klein, 33, said at the time he would 
rather shut down his shop than 'be forced to do something that violates 
[his] conscience', according to NBC. 

Despite
the backlash from members of the public, Mr Klein told NBC they still 
believe they have the right to serve whomever they want.

'I
believe that marriage is a religious institution ordained by God. The 
Book of Genesis talks about that for this reason: A man shall leave his 
father and mother and cleave to his wife,' NPR reported Klein as saying.

Backlash: The Kleins say business has dropped by 50 per cent at Sweet Cakes by Melissa since they refused to serve a lesbian couple

He
said at the time that while business had suffered, and the company was 
'struggling' their faith was more important to them than making money.

Authorities
are investigating whether the business violated the Oregon Equality Act
of 2007, which protects the rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and 
transgender people in employment, housing and public accommodations.

If the complaint is upheld, the inquiry could be referred for prosecution or a settlement may be negotiated.

This
is reportedly the 10th complaint to the state in the last five years 
involving allegations of discrimination in a public place based on 
sexual orientation or gender identity.

Labor
Commissioner Brad Avakian told The Oregonian at the time that people 
are entitled to their beliefs, but aren't allowed to discriminate.
