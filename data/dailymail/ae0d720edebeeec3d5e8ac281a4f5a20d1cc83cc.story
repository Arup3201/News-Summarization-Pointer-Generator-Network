Sacked: Science teacher Richard West was sacked after he accidentally shot 17-year-old pupil Ben Barlow in the leg with a pellet gun during a classroom experiment

A teacher has been sacked after he accidentally shot a pupil with an air gun.

But the boy he injured has begun a Facebook campaign calling for him to be given his job back.

Popular physics teacher Richard West had been demonstrating an experiment to measure the deceleration of a pellet as it passed through sheets of paper when the freak accident occurred.

The pellet apparently deflected off a table, hitting 17-year-old AS-level pupil Ben Barlow in the leg.

Yesterday, as the Facebook page he set up in support of Mr West passed 2,170 ‘likes’, Ben said a safety pin could have caused him more harm.

He said he decided to study physics because of the 53-year-old teacher’s ability to ‘make the subject come alive’.

About 20 lower-sixth formers at St Peter’s Collegiate, Wolverhampton, volunteered to hold sheets of paper at arms-length over a line of desks, Ben said. He was about three-quarters of the way down the line when he was struck.

‘The bullet travelled through the first ten or 11 sheets, then it must have hit a desk below and cannoned into me,’ he said. ‘It was just a momentary pain, like when you walk into the corner of a table. I was left with just a scratch.’

Following the accident in November, Mr West was ‘extremely concerned and apologetic’ and the experiment was halted.

Ben mentioned the incident to his mother that night, and she spoke to the school.

Mr West was suspended soon afterwards and dismissed last week following a disciplinary hearing. It is understood that he was found guilty of gross misconduct.

Ben said he has written to school governors in protest at Mr West’s dismissal. A source said senior figures at the school were aware that head of science Mr West had sometimes used a pellet gun – which is legal for adults to buy and possess – in experiments.

Popular: While some parents at the school have  labelled Mr West 'irresponsible', pupils including Ben have started a campaign calling for him to be re-instated

Yesterday father-of-two Mr West, who 
lives with wife Marion, 54, in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, said he wanted 
his job back but refused to comment further for fear of jeopardising his
 appeal against dismissal.

Friends said the teacher was ‘devastated’ at the loss of his unblemished 20-year career at the school.

But
 one parent said: ‘I can’t believe a teacher thought it was appropriate 
to take a gun into a school. Surely there are safer ways to do this 
experiment than taking a deadly weapon into the classroom?’

Disciplined: The incident happened in November and it is believed Mr West was suspended soon afterwards, before being permanently sacked this week

Campaign: Dozens of pupils past and present left comments on the Facebook page Bring Back Westy 2014, calling Mr West a 'true inspiration', the 'best teacher ever' and 'the king of St Peter's'

Head teacher Adrian Richards said Mr West was sacked after a full investigation.

‘As we are still in the appeal phase of the process, it would be inappropriate to comment any further,’ he added.

Ben said pupils taught by Mr West in 1997 had offered support on his Facebook page, Bring Back Westy 2014.

Pupil Isabella Leadbeater, 17, said: ‘We’re infuriated about this and Mr West has been humiliated.’

Tim
 Cooper, a former English teacher at St Peter’s, said Mr West was ‘one 
of the best teachers I’ve ever had the privilege of teaching with’.
