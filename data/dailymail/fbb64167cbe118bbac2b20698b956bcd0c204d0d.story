A woman needed plastic surgery after she was mauled by three dangerous dogs owned by the wife of a wealthy wine merchant.

Kate Hancock was walking her German Shepherd-cross Cassie in woods when she was set upon.

She was knocked to the ground and bitten on the face, head and arms by the Anatolian Shepherd dogs, a large muscular breed that has the strength to take down lions.

Horrific: Kate Hancock suffered terrible bites to her head and arms as her nine-year-old dog was savaged to death next to her. She is pictured in hospital after the attack which took place in woods in Weston-super-Mare

Painful: Mrs Hancock needed plastic surgery to her face after the attack

Cassie was savaged to death during the attack in Wrington Woods, North Somerset.

The three dogs, from a breed which can
weigh more than 10st, had escaped from the country home of Sarah and 
John Avery, who were on holiday at the time of the attack.

But despite being abroad, Mrs Avery – 
as owner of the dogs – was ordered to pay £10,000 in costs because the 
person she had left in charge had failed to supervise them.

Recalling the attack, Mrs Hancock told
Bristol Crown Court: ‘It was horrifying. Initially one of the dogs 
attacked me, then as it latched on to my arm the other two dogs started 
to attack my dog.

‘I ran towards them screaming, trying 
to hit one of the bigger dogs with my lead. But then one of them, which 
was so big it came up to my waist, just knocked me over and started 
biting my face.’

She continued: ‘I buried my head in 
the earth to try and protect my eyes, while it was biting the back of my
head. It then went back to attacking my dog and I realised there was 
nothing I could do to save her. They were jumping on her and biting her 
throat.

‘I was in fear for my life. God knows what would have happened if a child had been with me.’

Lucky escape: After the court case, Mrs Hancock said: 'I'm a fairly fit woman and was with a fairly large dog. If I had a child with me or if I had been frail then the consequences could have been much more serious'

Killed: Miss Hancock with her dog, a German Shepherd-cross, called Cassie, which was mauled to death

She added: ‘To see your dog being mauled by other dogs and being incapable to help is every dog owner’s worst nightmare.’

The trial heard that Avery and her 
husband were in New Zealand at the time of the attack and the dogs in 
the care of a tenant who was renting an annexe attached to their house.

Somehow Mrs Hancock, 47, who lives 
near Weston-super-Mare, managed to get to a nearby house, from where she
telephoned her husband and was taken to hospital.

Speaking of the breed owned by the 
Averys, Mrs Hancock, who now has a retriever-cross called Biscuit, said:
‘They are used to guard flocks of sheep in Asia and could bring down a 
leopard. They are incredibly unsuitable dogs to be kept as family pets 
and people need to be aware of the harm these breeds can present.’

Prosecutor Simon Morgan said Avery had
not fulfilled her responsibility to leave the animals in the care of 
someone who could adequately supervise them.

The court was also told that 18 months earlier one of the dogs had escaped into the woods and bitten a man through his clothing.

Vicious: Mrs Hancock was attacked by three Anatolian Shepherd dogs, similar to this one, which had been left to roam wild in the woods

Mrs Avery was told to pay £10,000 in 
costs and ordered to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work after being found
guilty of being the owner of a dog causing injury while ‘dangerously’ 
out of control.

One of the three dogs has since died and another has been rehomed.

Sentencing, Judge Lambert did not 
order that the remaining dog should be destroyed because it could not be
proved to have caused the injuries to Mrs Hancock in October 2009.

But he added: ‘It seems to me these dogs are not appropriate to be kept in England.’

The court heard a civil claim between 
Mrs Hancock and Avery had been settled for an undisclosed sum before the
trial. Sam Jones, defending Avery, said: ‘She wishes to say how sorry 
she is that this incident occurred.’

Bristol-based Avery’s Wine Merchants 
have been selling wine since 1793, and Mr Avery, the 69-year-old 
chairman of the company, is the fourth generation of his family to run 
the business.

Speaking after the sentencing, his wife said: ‘There is nothing I can say which will make her dog come back.

‘What I would obviously like to say is
that we are terribly sorry. It really has been a most unfortunate 
incident with bad consequences.’
