A woman who was diagnosed with lung cancer just four months into her marriage has documented her journey - by having her photo taken every day for a year.

Jennifer Glass, from San Mateo, California, discovered she had advanced lung cancer in January 2013 after her husband found a lump in her neck.

Starting on the day the family learned she had cancer; the time-lapse video follows the 50-year-old for her first year, through chemo, radiation and finally, a halt in cancer growth.

The beginning: The first photograph of Jennifer Glass, taken by her husband Harlan Seymour, when they first got the diagnosis on January 5, 2013

Documentation: Ms Glass' husband took one photograph of her every day, all the way through chemotherapy and radiation

Drastic move: After first cutting her hair short Ms Glass decided to shave her head when her hair started falling out as a result of the radiation and chemotherapy she underwent in March and April last year

Just months after marrying Harlan 
Seymour, Ms Glass was given the devastating news that she had Stage IV 
metastatic lung cancer.

On 
her blog, she writes: ‘ Apart from that lump, I had no symptoms. I felt 
healthy, energetic, and strong as I embarked on the most joyful and 
contented phase of my life.

‘We were newlyweds, having just gotten married a few months before.’

Ms Glass’ cancer was non-small cell lung cancer, stage IIIB, with an estimated five-year survival rate of five per cent.  

Keeping up appearances: Despite the devastating effect the chemo and radiation had on her body, Ms Glass kept smiling throughout

Against the odds: Ms Glass was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, stage IIIB, which has an estimated five-year survival rate of five per cent

After she started taking oral chemo drugs, she developed severe side effects, including skin rashes

Oh her way: Ms Glass's side effects slowly faded as she was allowed to lower her dose of chemotherapy drugs

On the other side: Jennifer Glass is not yet in remission but the cancer has stopped spreading in her body

The following month Ms Glass started 
having chemotherapy and radiation, and took the proactive decision to 
shave her hair off when it started falling out, clearly visible in the 
timelapse video.

At
 the end of April, Ms Glass, her husband and her two step-children were 
told the tumour in her neck was 'all but gone' and the primary tumour at
 the top her left lung had stopped growing, and she went into preventive
 chemotherapy to stop it from spreading again.

Standing strong: Ms Glass and Mr Seymour on their wedding day in August 2012, with his two children Tristan and Eloise

In
 June she begun taking oral chemotherapy drugs, but the medication, 
Tarceva, has severe side effects and she developed a serious skin 
problem until the dose was lowered.

Although
 she is not yet in remission, the cancer is no longer growing or 
spreading and Ms Glass and her family now focus on maintaining this 
positive state.  

Back in the day: Ms Glass and her mother in 1965

Positive mindset: Jennifer is visited by her friend Helen in Spring 2013, as she had undergone radiation

Long battle: Ms Glass is pictured wrapped up warm while in hospital undergoing the first part of chemotherapy

Not giving up: After undergoing oral and IV chemotherapy and radiation, Ms Glass is pictured during a CT scan in October which she now has regularly to ensure the cancer is not spreading

Family support: Ms Glass with her husband Harlan Seymour who discovered the lump in her neck when they had only been married four months

Ms Glass 
said: ‘The cancer has stopped growing for now. "Remission" means that 
there is no evidence of cancer in my body and it will be years before we
 can say that. 

‘For now we
 can say that my cancer seems to be contained and we are working to 
manage it so that it does not grow or spread again. 

‘I get a CT scan every few months, so we pretty much live quarter to quarter waiting for these results.’

Ms Glass writes about her journey on her blog At the Top of My Lungs.
