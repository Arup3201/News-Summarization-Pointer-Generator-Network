Open-mouthed: Mrs Shelley started by painting her children for Halloween and unearthed her hidden talent

She said: ‘I didn't think anything would come of it but the reaction to my work has been incredible. I don't really have an idea in mind when I start to paint. I just start and see what happens.’

Mrs Shelley, who is married to Craig, 37, started by painting her children Taylor, 13, Leah, 11, and Kaiden, nine, for Halloween and unearthed her talent.

The mother’s portfolio has been praised by more than 1,000 Facebook users, and her family were so impressed by her work that they told her to take it further. Now she wants to turn professional.

Mrs Shelley said: ‘I started painting my kids' faces for Halloween, then I asked Craig if I could paint him as well. But I knew I couldn't paint on them all the time so I started painting my own face.

‘I started to think of ways I could make my work different. I wanted to stand out and try new things. Luckily it has paid off.’

She said she is inspired by prosthetic designer Neill Gorton, who has now asked her to be a teacher at an industry conference in Birmingham next month called The Prosthetics Event.

Mrs Shelley, who shares her surname with Frankenstein author Mary Shelley and lives in a £140,000 semi-detached three-bedroom  house, added: ‘I never imagined I'd be an educator at a Neill Gorton show. 

'The last 18 months have just been incredible. I now want to learn the prosthetics side of things and hopefully one day I might get the opportunity to work on TV shows and movies.’
