The mysterious death of a 25-year old University of Michigan medical student last Wednesday is being treated as a homicide as friends remember him as a would-be surgeon who 'would have cured cancer'.

Paul DeWolf was discovered dead from a gunshot wound in his own bedroom at a university fraternity house on the 200 block of North Ingalls Street he shared with other medical students in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

His room was neat and tidy and no valuables had been removed when his body was found at around 11 p.m. - and so far no suspects have been named and no weapon found.

'Upon officersâ€™ arrival, the apartment was orderly and valuables appeared to have been untouched,' Ann Arbor Police Department Lieutenant Robert Pfannes said in a press release.

Following the murder investigation, the University of Michigan has increased campus patrols and warned students that a killer may be on the loose.

The university is taking 'all necessary steps to assure the safety of the campus community,' said University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman to ABC News.

At his home in Western Michigan, DeWolf's loved ones spoke to ABC News of their utter disbelief that the aspiring surgeon has apparently been killed.

'He had such big aspirations for life,' DeWolf's friend Sarala Sarah said. 'He's the type of person who would have cured cancer.'

Joshua DeWolf said his brother was excited about beginning a military career after graduation in May 2014.

'His life came to an end in his prime,' Joshua DeWolf said to Ann Arbor News.

'I have no tears for him,' Thom DeWolf, Paul's father, said at his funeral on Sunday. 'He is released. He is in heaven.'

DeWolf is an enlisted second lieutenant in the United States Air Force and was studying at university to complete his surgical training.

He was in his fourth year of studying and graduated from Grand Valley State University in Allendale three years prior.

Police say DeWolf failed to arrive for a scheduled assignment at the Veteran's Affairs Hospital. The hospital sent a colleague to the home to check on him, and that person discovered DeWolf had died - He was an enthusiastic marathon runner too

Another of his close friends, Jason Halterman said that DeWolf had an infectious love of life.

'He loved everyone regardless,' said Halterman to ABC News.

'He taught me to be a better, more caring person and I love him for it.'

DeWolf was a frequent poster to Facebook about his passion for scuba diving and running marathons.

At his funeral service on Monday, the accomplished student's list of achievements were read out according to Michigan Live.

He was the captain of the cross country team at Schoolcraft High School and graduated as class valedictorian in 2006.

He took his bachelors degree in bio-medical sciences from Grand Valley State University in 2010 and then joined the Air Force - where he was in the top ten percent certified in officer training.

He belonged to Sigma Phi Epsilon at Grand Valley State University and Phi Rho Sigma Fraternity at the University of Michigan.

DeWolf was a brilliant piano and French horn player, was a certified scuba diver, traveled the world on several mission trips, and had competed in marathons.

He was a devout Christian.

A statement from the university said that DeWolf was the 'epitome of everything great in the field of medicine.'

'We extend our deepest condolences to Paul's family, friends and colleagues,' UM president Coleman added to the statement.

'He was working and training among a close, nurturing community of healers and I know they will help each other through this difficult time. They will need the support of the broader campus community in the weeks and months ahead, and we will provide it.'
