A young woman got the shock of her life when a lip enhancing product she bought online left her looking like she had just gone a round in a boxing ring.

Brittany Forster, 24, of Perth, Western Australia, bought CandyLipz from the company's website and tried it - sticking the apple-shaped device over her mouth and applying suction.

After two 'horrific' minutes of watering eyes and painful lips, she removed the application and was appalled with the results, which had left her with a huge trout  pout.

Brittany's lips were completely unrecognisable, swollen and bruised from the lip enhancing product. 

The young woman, who now lives in Sydney, where she is studying for her Masters in Education, was so shocked that she began hyperventilating, worried that she would be left with permanent scarring.

'I took it off and I just looked in the mirror and I said oh my god what have I done? No, no, no, this can’t be happening,’ Brittany told Daily Mail Australia. 

‘As soon as I looked in the mirror I thought what have I done to myself?.'

After looking up blogs online about how Kylie Jenner got her famous lips, Brittany decided to try out CandyLipz

The application takes two minutes and makes the user's eyes and lips sting 

'I was thinking it was permanent. When I put the lipstick on, I was like, well if this is my life now I'm going to have to start enjoying it. I’ll have to embrace it.' 

CandyLipz is a lip plumper which can freely be bought online. According to the company's website, the effects of the product can last for up to two hours. 

Other lip enhancing devices, including the Jolie Lips Plumping System, De Luxe Lip Plumper, and Luscious Lips by Cynthia Rowland can also be bought on a range of sites online. 

Brittany posted a video online after the incident in which her two best friends are trying to comfort her by saying: ‘They’ll go down, they’ll go down, don’t worry’.

But Brittany did not appreciate their comments at the time, saying 'can you see my face?'

After uploading a video of the moment she unveiled her new lips to her friends on YouTube, Brittany said she now finds the situation funny, despite the fact she is left 'looking like she's been sucking on a pen all day'.

The applicator for CandyLipz latches onto your lips and squeezes them, giving users a tingling sensation. 

'It’s quite a painful experience,' Brittany said.

Brittany was horrified with the results of the application and left worrying she would be like that forever

'You put it on for two minutes  and it’s quite horrific and then you take it off.'

However, the pain was worth it for Brittany, who had been looking at blogs on how famous Kardashian sister, Kylie Jenner, gets her massive pout, hoping to emulate the star.  

Kylie Jenner is now notorious for having some of the biggest lips in Hollywood and Brittany thought her secret was CandyLipz. 

‘The funny thing is that when I saw Kylie Jenner's lips I thought they’re ridiculous, she’s gone too far,' Brittany said. 

'But joke’s on me because that’s exactly what happened to me.’ 

Brittany's inspiration was Kylie Jenner, who is now famous for having a massive pout

Brittany believes the joke is now on her and that she 'should have expected it'

Four days after the application, Brittany's lips are still battered and bruised. 

'They're still really blue and bruised, I look dead. The next day they were still really red and quite big but now they’re just bloodied and bruised,' she said. 

Brittany does not blame CandyLipz for her bruised lips, claiming she knew what she was getting herself into and she said her lips will go down after a few more days.

‘In the instruction leaflet it does say all these things could happen, like bruising, swelling etc., but I just thought I was an expert on everything and used it thinking it’ll be fine, what can happen,' she said. 

‘I should have just expected it.’ 

The traumatic experience has put the 24-year-old off ever using the product again though and she says she is now satisfied with the lips she was born with. 

‘I’ll probably give it a miss. I think I've had my time with CandyLipz’, she said.

CandyLipz say it is 'very normal' to get cupping marks from the product and that the bruising should resolve itself within 7 days. The company provided the following pictures which demonstrate the effects of CandyLipz

‘I’m very appreciative of my little lips now. Grateful for what I have’.

CandyLipz said they 'love' the video and couldn't believe how plump Brittany's lips were following the application.

'My, she got huge lips, we love it' CandyLipz told Daily Mail Australia.

The company said that the swelling is a sign that the product has actually worked and it is 'normal' to get cupping marks from the applicator.

'It is very normal to get the cupping marks. These marks are temporary and will resolve within 7 days or less,' a spokesperson said. 

'To have huge lips, we all went through this conditioning period. After the conditioning period, the cupping marks will not return if you continue to use the lip plumper daily.' 

The CandyLipz website claims that the product is suitable for 16-year-olds and older and is designed to 'raise the arches of the cupid’s bow, fills in grooves, and lip pits, lift the corners of the mouth, and block the development of duck lips.' 

CandyLipz said the bruising and swelling will do down in a few days
