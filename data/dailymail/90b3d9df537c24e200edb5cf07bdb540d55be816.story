Joshua Makin died after taking the nicotine patch-style painkiller fentanyl as a joke at a party in September 2012

A trainee legal clerk died after swallowing a nicotine patch-style painkiller while experimenting with recreational drugs at a party.

Joshua Makin ate the single super-strength opiate patch as a joke, not realising it would give him 50 times the recommended safe dose.

Hours after the 20-year-old went to bed laughing with his girlfriend about taking the drugs, which should have been attached to his hip, he died in his sleep as he lay next to his girlfriend.

Waking to discover her boyfriend lifeless next to her, Summer Harrison alerted a friend who called 999. But paramedics who rushed to help were unable to revive Mr Makin, an apprentice at a solicitor's firm.

Investigations into what happened revealed the patch taken by Mr Makin was from a batch of fentanyl, which had been prescribed to a former airline pilot who suffered chronic back pain.

The drugs had been stolen by the man's college dropout son and sold to friends at the party, Mr Makin and his girlfriend had been at the night before his death.

A coroner today recorded a verdict of misadventure after examining the circumstances leading to the 20-year-old's death.

Reacting to the verdict, his mother Louise said: 'Anybody trying recreational drugs is playing Russian roulette with their lives.

'If they truly knew what we had gone through after Josh’s death, I would hope they would never do it again. It’s been hell since he died.'

The hearing heard Mr Makin, from Ashton-on-Mersey in Greater Manchester, and Miss Harrison had been invited to stay at the home of his friend Jonathan Drinkhill, while his parents were away in September last year.

The pair played FIFA on a games console and listened to music, while taking recreational drugs including valium and ketamine.

Mr Drinkhill, 21, said: 'We got 10 tablets of valium and 1g of ketamine and made it last a few hours.

'We both felt fine and happy. We played on the computer and drank some lager and then Josh’s girlfriend came round.'

Ambrose Murray was jailed in November to 18 months in prison for supplying Class A drugs. He stole the fentanyl patches from his father, who suffered chronic back pain

Later former grammar school dropout Ambrose Murray, 22, turned up at the sleepover with a batch of drugs he had stolen from his father, by sneaking a key from his dressing gown to open a locked draw.

Murray, from Altrincham, had already posted messages on Facebook a week earlier saying: 'Does anyone there want to buy fents?'

When he arrived at Mr Drinkhill’s house in Timperley he emptied the patches out of his pocket on to a table.

Mr Drinkhill added: 'I had never heard of them before this and didn’t have any idea what they were. They looked like a nicotine patch and you had to break the seal to get in.

'We took one each and placed it on our waist like Ambrose said.

'Soon after that everyone left but Joshua placed a patch on his forehead and then placed the patch in his mouth.

'He was joking around when he put it on his forehead - trying to get a laugh out of me.

'He put the same patch in his mouth and swallowed it. He then went to sleep and so did I.

'In the morning I was woken by his girlfriend who said there was something wrong with him so I rushed in the front room and called an ambulance.'

Mr Makin's girlfriend Miss Harrison wept as she told the hearing: 'Ambrose had the patches and they said they were going to buy them and they were going to give him the money the next day.

'They were asking about opiates and your tolerance levels and Ambrose said you just put it on your skin. Joshua put one on his hip. I didn’t see him do any more.

'When Ambrose and the others left I was tired so me and Joshua went to go to sleep on the sofa. He did go out the room to speak to Jonathan and came in with a patch on his head and I didn’t know what it was.

'He came in again laughing saying he had swallowed it but I didn’t know what it was so didn’t know if it was anything to worry about. We were lying down and talking until we went to sleep.

'When I woke up I noticed a rash on him which looked like purple blotches or bruises on his side.

'I tried to wake him but he didn’t wake up. I ran to get Jonathon then telephoned the ambulance and tried to start CPR. The ambulance arrived but he was dead.'

A toxicology report found Josh had 52.4mg of fentanyl per litre of blood. Those using the prescription painkiller for its intended purpose require between 1.9 and 3.8mg per litre.

Fentanyl is an opiate painkiller, similar to morphine.

The drug has a rapid onset and short duration.

It is approximately 100 times more potent than morphine.

Intravenous fentanyl is commonly used as anesthesia in the operating theatre.

The patch is used in the management of chronic pain.

They work by releasing the drug into body fat underneath the skin, which then slowly releases into the bloodstream over 48 to 72 hours.

The patches provide long-lasting pain relief.

A typical patch will start to take effect within eight to 12 hours.

Dosage is based on the size of the patch.

Toxicologist Julie Evans told the inquest Mr Makin took 50 times the recommended dose.

She said: 'Fentanyl patches are designed to slowly release the drugs over three days - a trickle feed. If someone swallows them it’s released much quicker.

'The acid in the stomach breaks it down and the drug is released. A 100mg patch would contain 16,800mg of drug as it is designed to release 100mg per hour.

'It’s an opioid - a synthetic opiate. It’s a depressant for the central nervous system and slows the heart down which has a knock-on effect.

'It’s more falling asleep and not waking up as apposed to anything violent. You go to sleep and your heart rate stops.'

Murray was jailed for 18 months in November for supplying Class A drugs.

Coroner Joanne Kearsley said: 'Joshua was a young man who together with friends thought that using drugs was a way they wanted to spend time and money - but what happened was a highly tragic consequence.

'He was loved by his friends and he was outgoing and popular. This appears to be a mindless impulsive act which has tragically led to his death.

'Hopefully it can teach a lesson to any of his friends or young people who use drugs. I hope his death acts as a warning.'

The medicine which is similar to morphine, is used for treating chronic pain and induces relaxation and euphoria.

Skin patches containing fentanyl are designed to be worn like a nicotine patch for 72 hours, releasing the drug slowly into the bloodstream.

It takes 12 hours for the full effects of the patch, often used for terminal illnesses, to wear off. But several patients have claimed they became addicted to the drug.
