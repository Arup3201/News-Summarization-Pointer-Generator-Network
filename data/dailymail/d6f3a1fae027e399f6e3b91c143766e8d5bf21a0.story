Each picture takes hours of painstaking work, as artist's spend up to ten hours at a time covering Liu Bolin in paint so that he blends seamlessly into the background.

The 40-year old is such a perfectionist, bystanders often walk by with no idea he is even there until he moves.

This new series of photographs feature some of his most eye-catching works to date.

In one, he somehow manages to disappear in front of a wall covered in mobile phones and stood on the harbour with a huge naval ship in the background.

The Chinese national, who has gathered critical and popular acclaim around the world for his body of work, says the pictures make a statement about his place in society.

'Each one chooses his or her path to come in contact with the external world. I chose to merge with the environment,' he said about his upcoming exhibition.
