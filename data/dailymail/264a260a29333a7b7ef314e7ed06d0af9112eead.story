The next generation of rockets has been revealed as SpaceX founder Elon Musk showed off a reusable capsule he says will revolutionize access to space.

Musk, who was behind the Tesla electric sports car, showed off his Dragon V2 at the headquarters of his rocket building company near Los Angeles on Thursday.

The company has already flown unmanned capsules to the Space Station, but the latest design will be capable of taking up to seven astronauts into low-Earth orbit.

As he revealed the cone-shapped Dragon
 V2, he explained the manned aircraft could land anywhere on land 'with 
the accuracy of a helicopter'.

The
 technology would enable rapid reloading as well as meaning the 
spacecraft could be reused he said, noting that in the past rockets and 
space craft return to Earth in a fireball.

'This is extremely important for revolutionizing access to space because as long as we continue to throw away rockets and space crafts, we will never truly have access to space it'll always be incredibly expensive,' Musk said.

The white capsule featured a sleek interior with swing-up computer screens at the control station, a two-level seating system to accommodate up to seven astronauts, and windows for them to marvel at Earth's curvature.

Since the shuttle fleet retired in 2011, NASA has depended on Russian rockets to transport astronauts to orbit and back, paying nearly $71 million per seat.Â

The space agency said that it wants U.S. companies to fill the void by 2017 and has handed out seed money to spur innovation.

SpaceX, which stands for Space Exploration Technologies Corp, has made four cargo runs to the Space Station about 200 miles above Earth.

Last month, its Dragon capsule splashed into the Pacific, returning nearly 2 tons of science experiments and old equipment.

Companies competing for the right to ferry station astronauts need to design a spacecraft that can seat a crew of four or more, and be equipped with life support systems and an escape hatch in case of emergency.

SpaceX has said that it is designing a seven-seat spacecraft.

SpaceX and longtime NASA contractor Boeing Co. are 'more or less neck and neck' in the competition, but there's a long way to go before astronauts can rocket out of the atmosphere on private spacecraft, John Logsdon, professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, said.

Logsdon said progress by private companies is slower than anticipated mainly because Congress has not fully funded NASA's budget request for the effort.

He said it was important for the U.S. to wean its reliance on Russia given the political tension over the annexation of Crimea.

'It's essential to have our own capability to transport people to space,' he said. 'This is an important step in that direction.'
