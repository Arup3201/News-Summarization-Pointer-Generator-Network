Two parents were jailed after pleading guilty to abusing and neglecting their five children, leaving their youngest son starved to the brink of death.

Andy and Jessie Meeks, both 25, were each sentenced to seven years yesterday and have lost their parental rights.

On April 15 last year, police went to their home in Middletown, Connecticut after reports of a domestic disturbance. They found five children, all under the age of six, in disgusting conditions without food, heat or proper clothing.

Abuse: Jessie Meeks and her husband Andy Meeks, both 25, were jailed for seven years in Connecticut for starving their children and leaving them to sleep on soiled mattresses

Officers at the home reported that it stank of urine and the mattresses where the children slept were covered in vomit and feces.

Piles of dirty clothes, empty beer cans and dishes lay all over the property, there was no bedding and the heating system had not worked in a long time, according to authorities. 

The Meeks' youngest child, a five-month-old boy, was so malnourished that he was only the size of a newborn.

The baby who was 'minimally responsive' was flown to Connecticut Medical Center along with his two-year-old brother.

According to the Middletown Press, a doctor who treated the baby said he was so badly neglected he 
may have died within days and the 'officer very likely saved the infant’s 
life'. 

The parents did not contact doctors to find out about their son's condition until three days later.

House of horrors: The police had went to the Meek family home in Middletown, Connecticut after reports of a domestic dispute but found their five children starved and beaten

The three older children - two boys, 
six and five, and a four-year-old girl - told police that their father 
beat them with a paddle and that they only got dinner 'on a few days'. 

The five-year-old added 'he asked for too much stuff' and his parents would make him garbage and 'stick his face in it'. 

The little girl said her mother would put hot sauce in her mouth as punishment.

A social worker later said an entire box of baby wipes was needed to clean the four-year-old's feet and the children's clothes had to be thrown away because they were so ragged and filthy.

While being questioned by police, the only time Jessie Meeks cried was when she was told she would no longer be entitled 
to $654 in state aid since her children had been taken away.

The Meeks claimed to have been feeding the
baby, who was born prematurely, 8 ounces of oatmeal a day but doctors 
said this was not possible given his condition.

Critical: The Meeks' five-month-old baby was taken to hospital in Connecticut because police found the child malnourished and barely responsive

Andy Meeks said his children 'have really high metabolisms' and blamed the appalling condition of the house on the fact his wife had depression, abused drugs and drank a lot.

The couple pleaded guilty earlier this year to five counts of risk of injury to a minor.

At their sentencing, Judge Susan Handy said: 'I don’t know how you could let your children starve and live in their own waste. Two were near death. You are unfit to be a parent.'

Both were sentenced to seven years. Andy Meek will serve one year in jail and be on probation for five. His wife will serve two years and a further five on probation.

All
the Meek children were taken from the home on the day they were found 
by police and placed in state care. They are all now with foster 
families.
