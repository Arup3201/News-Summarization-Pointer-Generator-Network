Dragons' Den tycoon Duncan Bannatyne and X Factor winner Joe McElderry were among hundreds of well-wishers who paid tribute to an 11-year-old boy who died from cancer.

Harry Moseley, from Sheldon, Birmingham was diagnosed with a brain tumour four years ago and raised more than £500,000 for Cancer Research UK during his illness.

Family and friends packed out St Edburgha's Church in Yardley, Birmingham, today for the colourful funeral service, which even featured a SpongeBob 
SquarePants coffin.

The celebrity attendees were among hundreds of mourners who paid their final respects to the celebrated fundraiser, who died on October 8 after a four-year cancer battle.

His Help Harry Help Others campaign attracted widespread admiration from stars including Duncan Bannatyne and England captain John Terry.

The medieval church was so full that many listened to
 the service on loudspeakers in the grounds and surrounding streets.

Harry's mother Georgina Moseley, who referred to her son as a 'hero' as said: 'Your quick wit and approachable, fun-loving charm left a lasting impression on everyone you ever met or tweeted.'

Using his illness as a positive, Harry raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity through his campaign, by speaking at events and selling hand-made bracelets.

Many of the congregation wore the colourful bracelets while others wore T-shirts printed with a picture of him.

Mrs Moseley added: 'You will not be remembered as Harry with a brain tumour but as Harry who helped people with brain tumours.'

'You made it happen H, I hope you never forget that.'

Harry's 17-year-old sister Danielle Green read a poem about her brother 
to the congregation and X Factor winner Joe McElderry performed his 
single The Climb, one of Harry's favourite songs.

Reverend John Tsipouras, who led the service, described Harry as a 'remarkable boy' who 'put the can into cancer'.

He said: 'He just had the biggest heart. He inspired other people and simply brightened up their days.'

Special boy: Harry's bravery touched many people during his life

During her tribute Mrs Moseley added: 'My baby boy, my best friend and my hero. No one will ever understand the close bond we shared.

'I will always be bursting with immense pride when I talk and think about you.

'I will always, always love you with all of my heart.'

The gathered crowds burst into applause as Harry's coffin was carried out of the church.

The funeral was followed by a private service at Yardley Crematorium.

Richard Taylor, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We’re extremely saddened to hear that the extraordinarily brave young Harry Moseley has tragically lost his fight against brain cancer.

'Harry was a very special boy – even when faced with a life-threatening illness he retained his cheeky persona and his drive to help others.

'He truly touched the hearts of everyone that he met and the difference he made during his short life is remarkable.'
