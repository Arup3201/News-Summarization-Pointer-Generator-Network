England risks being held to ransom by Scottish Nationalists unless Labour agrees to implement a system of ‘English votes for English laws’ at Westminster, William Hague said yesterday.

The Leader of the Commons said Ed Miliband was refusing to back a veto for English MPs over legislation that applies only to their constituents, to keep open the possibility of a Labour-SNP coalition.

The Conservatives said they planned to strip Scottish MPs of the power to impose tax changes, education and health reforms on England, given the Scottish Parliament will soon have control of all these issues.

Leader of the House of Commons William Hague speaking at The Policy Exchange yesterday, where he proposed that English MPs would have a veto on English only issues 

The reform would make it impossible for an incoming Labour government to press ahead with its plan to raise the top rate of tax to 50p in England, for example, without winning the support of a majority of English MPs.

Mr Hague said it was a ‘simple matter of fairness’. But his blueprint prompted a furious response from Labour and the SNP – as well as some Right-wing Tories who want to go further and create an effective English Parliament.

Former prime minister Gordon Brown claimed the proposals ‘put party before country’ and ‘risk the very survival of the UK’. He said governments had failed for 150 years to resolve the issue of ‘English votes’ while maintaining the ‘unity of the UK’.

Mr Brown said the Tory plan ‘means only one thing: restricting the rights of Scottish MPs to vote in the House of Commons, even to the extent of excluding them under legislative consent motions from Budget votes on key tax issues.

‘And the Conservatives have acted with huge cynicism: it was the Conservatives who proposed devolving all Scottish income tax to the Scottish Parliament, and they have now made this the pretext for giving English MPs the power of veto on the annual Budget vote on income tax rates.’

Stewart Hosie, SNP deputy leader and Treasury spokesman, condemned what he called a ‘shambolic and confused plan to stop Scottish MPs voting on parts of the entire UK budget’.

Labour would also be reluctant to embrace a full-blown system of ‘English votes’ because it has traditionally relied on the votes of its Scottish MPs – currently 40 – to get legislation through when in government. Tuition fees and foundation hospitals were passed into law thanks to votes of Labour’s ‘tartan army’, though neither applies in Scotland.

Polls suggest that since last year’s independence referendum, however, Labour support has collapsed in Scotland as voters switch to the SNP, which is hoping to win 20 or 30 MPs in May.

Former Tory donor turned pollster Lord Ashcroft is today due to release the most detailed analysis to date of the SNP surge. Despite the anger of Labour and the SNP, some Conservative MPs insisted Mr Hague had not gone far enough.

While he proposes a veto for MPs in England on issues that are decided north of the border by the Scottish Parliament, legislation would still require the ultimate approval of all UK MPs to pass.

Former frontbencher David Davis said: ‘It has built into it a formula for another constitutional crisis.’ John Redwood, a former Cabinet minister, welcomed the proposed power for English MPs to block legislation only applying in their constituencies and not Scotland. But he said Scottish Nationalists or Scottish Labour MPs could still ‘all gang up and try to block an English proposal until we cave in on what they wanted’.

Mr Hague said: ‘The Prime Minister and I have decided that the option we will put forward to Parliament and the country will be one that gives an effective veto to English MPs over matters only affecting England, or England and Wales, while maintaining the integrity of the United Kingdom Parliament.

‘We Conservatives believe that this principle of English consent, the English veto should be extended to taxation when the equivalent decisions have been devolved to Scotland – and under a Conservative Government it will be.

‘This is a fundamental matter of fairness. How could it possibly be right for the Scottish Parliament for example, to vote for a reduction in Air Passenger Duty in Scotland and then for Scottish MPs to come to Westminster and be able to impose an increase in Air Passenger Duty in England?’

He rejected the argument that reform will weaken the UK, insisting: ‘I say that failure to act would be the true weakening of the United Kingdom.’
