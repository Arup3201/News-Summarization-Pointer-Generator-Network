Dog owners may potentially face on-the-spot fines if their dog tries to attack someone - even if the animal doesn't bite. 

The fines will be issued for dogs that charge at people from behind fences or chase people down the street under a new proposal put forward by Queensland's councils.

The 'rush attack' fines will give local councils the power to fine pet owners on-the-spot for less serious attacks, like rushing, growling or barking.

While these attacks often don't cause injury, they do instil fear, according to Brisbane City Councillor Krista Adams. 

She said on-the-spot fines were necessary because the only option councils had at the moment was to take pet owners to court but that often didn't happen due to high costs.

Cr Adams said owners of dogs involved in these rush attacks often escape prosecution just because it's a less serious attack.

'It's a warning or court, there is nothing in between,' Cr Adams told the Brisbane Times. 

'When you're talking about a big dog standing in front of you barking and scaring you, that's not necessarily something we would take to court but an infringement is something we think is a different tool we could use.

'It's about getting legislation to use an infringement notice for this type of attack, at the moment under the animal management rushing animals are recognised as an offence but we don't have the power to enforce through a fine.'

Brisbane City Council won support for the proposal from the Local Government Association of Queensland on Wednesday.

The association will now lobby the Queensland State Government for legislative changes.

'We don't need to take dog owners to court over things that are out of their control but they do need to think more carefully about how they are looking after their dogs in public,' Cr Adams told the ABC.

'The dog may or not actually ever attack that person. It's about causing fear in the other person, so that's the difference.'

But the 'rush fine' proposal has been shut down by some, including RSPCA spokesman Mark Townend, who says it will just cause trouble.

'There will be a lot of disputes, they'll end up going to court fighting it because most dogs, even non-aggressive dogs will rush up to people in some circumstances,' he said.

'I think it's a bad move and I think there needs to be a lot more consultation with council before this is ever introduced.'
