The 62-year-old serial stowaway who was arrested Monday night after she managed to fly from San Jose to Los Angeles without a ticket has claimed her plane-hopping days are over - despite seven previous arrests.

After pleading no-contest to trespassing charges on Wednesday, Marilyn Hartman told reporters that she's sorry she sneaked through a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint and that it was a 'very stupid' thing to do. 

Hartman, who authorities say has a history of mental illness, has now been arrested eight times for trespassing at airports this year - though this is the first time she's been caught after successfully boarding a flight.

Outside the Los Angeles Airport Court on Wednesday, she was cherry, talkative and engaging - despite her dire circumstances.

Still smiling: Marilyn Hartman, 62, claimed she would never try to hop a plane again without a ticket - despite at least a half-dozen arrests for it this year alone

She was released from jail with the $4.25 in change that she had been carrying and directed to a nearby homeless shelter. 

A judge told her to stay away from airports. Court officials told her she could take a bus back to San Francisco. She's hopeful she can easily panhandle enough cash for a ticket.

'I think I've been on enough programs where people can recognize me. They might give me a dollar or two,' she told KNBC-TV. 

She said Wednesday that homelessness drove her to take 'desperate measures,' and that she feels safer being in airports than in the streets. 

San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said Wednesday that Hartman has no family and was never married. According to a her blog, found by the San Francisco Chronicle, she has lived in sketchy motels and squalid apartments from Seattle to San Diego in the last few years. 

Busted: Hartman has been repeatedly picked up at San Francisco Airport for trespassing. She made it onto a plane one time - but was discovered before it took off

Prosecutors in San Francisco has declined to press charges against her after a half-dozen arrests. Authorities say she is mentally ill

 She claims she was fired from her job as a legal secretary after she reported her boss for corruption. 

Records indicate Hartman was arrested November 6, 2010, at the Lihue Airport in Kauai after trespassing into the baggage claim area, the Chronicle reported. She was charged with simple trespass, but failed to show up for court hearings - and remains the subject of a bench warrant.

According to the newspaper, Hartman said in her blog that she had successfully hopped a plane once before. She was found out and detained - but later released without charge.  

In May - after being arrested seven times at San Francisco International Airport - Hartman was placed in a mental treatment program but she stopped attending last month.

'She declined all of our efforts to offer her assistance,' Wagstaffe said. 

'And we tried all of the alternatives we had because we weren't interested in locking her up on our end.'

Then she went back to the San Francisco airport, but Wagstaffe's office declined to file charges after her seventh arrest in July for another failed attempt. 

On Monday, Hartman was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained on board for the final destination to Phoenix. 

She was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department.

Hartman's antics - which previously targeted San Francisco International Airport - have made her something of a folk hero in the Bay Area.

On her first attempt, on February 15, she sneaked through TSA security and boarded a plane bound for Hawaii. She managed to take a seat on the flight - but was caught when the passenger who paid for a ticket in the seat showed up. 

She told police at the time that she had cancer - a claim that has not been substantiated - and that she wanted to go someplace warm.

A Go Fund Me page set up by sympathetic San Franciscans has raised nearly $1,300 toward sending her legally on a Hawaiian vacation.

The San Jose Mercury News reports that Hartman sneaked past the TSA agents check boarding passes while a family was being screened on Monday night. She had tried three times to get past the checkpoint unsuccessfully before she made it through.

She then got into the security line and was screened for weapons like all other passengers.

Once in the terminal, she tried unsuccessfully to board several planes before she was able to get aboard the Southwest Flight to Los Angeles.

Southwest, unlike many other major airlines, does not have assigned seats - which could explain how she wasn't discovered until the plane landed at LAX. 

This is the second high-profile security breach at Mineta San Jose International Airport this year. In April, a 15-year-old boy scaled a fence and sneaked into the wheel-well of a Maui-bound plane. Incredibly, he survived the freezing temperatures for five-and-a-half hours and landed safely in Hawaii.
