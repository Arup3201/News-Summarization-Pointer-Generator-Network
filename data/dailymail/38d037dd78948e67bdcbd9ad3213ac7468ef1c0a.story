A driver accused of running a Massachusetts stop sign and causing an ambulance crash that killed a patient is being charged with negligent motor vehicle homicide.

Driver: Lisa Zemack, 61, drove through a stop sign, hitting an ambulance and killing a dialysis patient who was being transported

A spokesman for Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early said Wednesday that Lisa Zemack, 61, also faces a charge of driving to endanger in connection with the crash a day earlier in Milford, 40 miles southwest of Boston.

Zemack, a local real estate agent, will be summoned to court at a later date.

Police say the patient in the ambulance was 58-year-old Upton resident Karen Scott.

They say she died when the ambulance was struck on its right rear bumper by Zemack's car and overturned.

She
 had been traveling from a dialysis appointment to an assisted care 
facility where she was living, according to the Boston Globe.

Surveillance video at a nearby pizza shop captured the crash.

Zemack's Mercedes can be seen driving straight towards an intersection as the ambulance approaches on Route 140.

Zemack neglects to stop, passing 
straight through a stop sign at Green Street and hitting the ambulance 
on its right rear bumper, causing it to spin and then flip over.

'Once it goes 90 degrees, physics and momentum causes it to flip over, a complete flip... It almost went over the guardrail,' Milford Police Sergeant John Sanchioni told the Boston Globe.

Karen Scott was pronounced dead at Milford Regional Hospital on Tuesday.

A paramedic riding with Scott in the ambulance was injured but has since been released from hospital.

The Boston Globe reports that Zemack has three prior citations, for speeding in 1990, 1995, and 2005.

There has been no answer at a telephone listing in the name of Zemack, who lives in Framingham. It's unknown if she has an attorney.Â
