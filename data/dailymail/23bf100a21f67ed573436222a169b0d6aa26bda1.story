Karim Benzema has laughed suggestions he's 'lazy' and believes that his goals for Real Madrid are the only thing that matter.

The French international's scored 11 goals in 20 La Liga outings and has five in five during Real's Champions League campaign.

His style of play and performances for the national side have come under scrutiny in the past but Benzema believes that his ability to score goals should do the talking.

Speaking to Surface Magazine he said: 'To me, to be lazy is not a defect, the only thing that matters are the goals.

'You could also reconsider the role of a striker, if you're lazy and don't run but make goals, there is nothing bad about that.

'I take criticism when it comes from someone who has played at a high level or who knows football.

The Real Madrid forward has scored an impressive 11 goals in 20 appearances in La Liga this season

'In these cases, I cannot say anything. But when they come from people who have never played level, I'm sorry but I don't listen to them.' 

Real Madrid will be looking to bounce back following their embarrassing 4-0 defeat to rivals Atletico Madrid, when they face Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday.

Carlo Ancelotti's side are still top of the La Liga table, a point ahead of Barcelona, and they know there's no more room for slip-ups.
