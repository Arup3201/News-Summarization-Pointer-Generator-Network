Josh Powell will never be buried next to the two young sons he killed in a blistering inferno, after police intervened in his family's plans to lay him to rest near their shared grave.

Pierce County Sheriff Paul Pastor and 
Detective Ed Troyer, who heads the anti-crime organization Crimestoppers
of Tacoma-Pierce County, Washington, have bought two plots 
at Woodbine Cemetery on either 
side of the boys.

A grave selected by Powell's relatives, just 
across a road, about 80 to 100ft away, has been on hold because the parents of Powell's missing wife, Susan, have promised legal action.

The cost of the burial plots next to the Powell boys is being paid by Crimestoppers, other organizations and private donations.

Troyer said Crimestoppers would allow
Susan Powell's family to use the plots as they saw fit, and if 
Crimestoppers raises money beyond the cost of the plots, any extra could
be spent on memorials.

'We might not be able to keep Josh 
Powell out of the cemetery, but it's way better than having him right 
next to the boys,' Troyer said.

Josh Powell's grave has already been dug and was covered with plywood on Wednesday. The Powell family has not paid for it yet,  Puyallup, Washington City Manager Ralph Dannenberg said.

'We don't have any rules or procedures regarding refusing plots to anyone,' said Dannenberg.

'We're going to wait to see what the outcome is in court.'

Powell was a suspect in Susan 
Powell's 2009 disappearance from their home in West Valley City, Utah. 
He attacked his sons with a hatchet and exploded his house in a 
gas-fuelled blaze, killing himself and the two boys on February 5.

Preventative measure: Crimestoppers has purchased the plots on either side of the gravesite of Charlie and Braden Powell (shown still covered by a cemetery canopy)

Empty plot: A cement cover is placed on top of an empty grave that has been reserved for Josh Powell up the hill, but not alongside the boys' grave, shown left under the canopy

The boys were laid to rest in a 
single casket at Woodbine on Saturday, with more than 1,000 mourners in 
attendance, and the Coxes hope to bury Susan Powell there too if her 
remains are ever found.

Attorney Anne Bremner, who represents
Susan Powell's parents, Charles and Judy Cox, says she will seek a 
temporary restraining order to block Josh Powell from being buried 
there. She said she could pursue claims against the city for emotional 
wrongs and outrage on behalf of the Coxes if the burial goes forward.

'For him to be buried near those kids is just unthinkable. For God's sake, for them to lose Susan first, and then the boys, and now this? Just give these people a break.'

'For him to be buried near those kids
is just unthinkable,' Ms Bremner said. 'For God's sake, for them to 
lose Susan first, and then the boys, and now this? Just give these 
people a break.'

Powell's sister Alina did not return an email seeking comment.

Steve Downing, another attorney for 
the Coxes, said his office received a series of anonymous calls on 
Tuesday afternoon reporting that Josh Powell's relatives had visited the
cemetery. Concerned, he emailed the city of Puyallup, south of Seattle,
on Tuesday night and asked to be notified of any plans to bury Josh 
Powell there.

'Same cemetery, different 
destinations,' was what he initially told his clients about the matter. 
But after speaking with the Coxes further, he said, they feared 'they 
couldn't go see their daughter or their grandsons with any peace at all'
if Powell's remains were nearby.

Josh Powell had always claimed that 
he didn't know what happened to his wife. He took the boys – then two 
and four – on a midnight camping trip in freezing weather in the Utah 
desert, he said, and when he returned home the next day authorities were
at the house looking for her.

Weeks later, he moved the boys to his
father Steve's home in Puyallup. After Steve's arrest on voyeurism and 
child pornography charges last fall, the boys were removed from the 
house and turned over to the Coxes.

On February 5, a social worker 
brought them to Josh Powell's rental home for what was supposed to be a 
court-sanctioned supervised visit. Powell let the boys inside, locked 
the social worker out, and killed them.

A judge had recently ordered 
that Powell undergo a psycho-sexual evaluation if he hoped to regain 
custody, and in a last-minute message to his sister he said he couldn't 
live without his boys.

Sergeant Denny Wood Wood of the Pierce 
County Sheriff’s Department described what police believe occurred on the day of the explosion.

'The
little boys come in,' he said. 'He takes them to the back and hits them
with the hatchet. Josh Powell scatters gas. He walks around the house, 
tossing it on the walls and floor.

Sham: The house that Josh Powell blew up to kill himself and his two sons was used as a ruse for social workers. He did not live there but placed photographs around to give the impression he did

Inferno: At a meeting for residents, police said Powell slashed the boys with a hatchet before lighting gasoline

Destroyed: The house, which neighbours thought was empty and abandoned, exploded within seconds

'He puts the five-gallon gas can by the front door. He sits with the other can between his knees.'

The social worker, who survived the attack, said the boys had been 
excited to see their father because he told them he had something 
special for them.

Graham, Washington house was also a sham home set up for social worker
visits, Wood said.

Questions: Powell was the sole person of interest in the case of his missing wife Susan, who disappeared in 2009

Powell, who was a person of interest 
in the disappearance of his wife Susan in 2009, did not live there, but dotted photographs on surfaces to give the 
impression he did.

Wood 
divulged the details at a meeting held for residents to ask law 
enforcement officials for information and advice on how to cope with the
tragedy. It was attended by around 50 people.

Many wished to hear that the boys did 
not suffer, the News Tribune reported. Wood said they had soot in their 
lungs, which showed they were still breathing, but he believes they had 
already been knocked unconscious.

Detective
Gary Sanders added: 'He committed the most evil act. And he gave them 
the greatest gift, which is to be in their mother’s arms.'

Since
the explosion, police have found new evidence relating to Susan 
Powell's disappearance. They discovered a blood-stained comforter, which
they are testing, in his storage unit.

Investigators
also found toys and kids' clothes in garbage bags in the unit, as well 
as framed pictures. Those items were given to Susan Powell's family.

Steve Powell remains in custody, and 
authorities are interested in knowing whether he has information about 
Susan Powell's fate.

On Tuesday, he filed a written notice in Pierce 
County Superior Court asserting his constitutional right to remain 
silent and not discuss any matters with Utah, Washington or federal law 
enforcement.
