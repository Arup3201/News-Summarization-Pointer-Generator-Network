As bushfires continue to rage in South Australia, a family run grocery store has shown its appreciation for the local firefighters through a touching donation of fruit and a receipt that notes their 'pure awesomeness'.

Justin Golding, 40, who runs and owns Golding's Gully Fruit Market at Tea Tree Gully, only 13 kilometres from Sampson Flats where the bushfires began, shared a copy of the receipt he addressed to the local volunteer Country Fire Service online.

The receipt - for 50KG of watermelon, 10kg of Bananas and 5 kg of cherries – had been totalled of to $00.00, a 100 per cent discount from $125.

Local business owner Justin Golding, donated $125 worth of fruit to his local fire station after his home was filled with smoke during the South Australian bushfires 

Mr Golding, a father-of-three, told Daily Mail Australia that he personally delivered the 65 kilograms of fruit to the Tea Tree Gully Fire Station.

'Our house is on the edge of where the fires were and when I woke up on Saturday morning, my house was full of smoke,' Mr Golding said.

'I went to work and thought "I can't open my shop, this is ridiculous" and I just felt useless; I'm not good in a crisis and thought the least I can do is bring something out to the boys.

'I just dropped it [the produce] off and wrote the receipt in jest. I wanted to show my appreciation somehow because I do believe all the firefighters are absolute heroes. The least I could do is take some fruit up for them to eat.'

Since Mr Goilding shared the picture of his receipt online less than 24 hours ago, he has received over 3,000 likes on Facebook and 2,000 on Redit.

The local producer also told of how his own house came close to destruction and mentioned that some of customers had lost their homes and pets.

'It was only 5km away and heading in our direction, but luckily the wind change direction,' Mr Golding said.

'I didn't think our house would go up, but it was more so the embers coming over and landing in our garden that were worrying. We have no lawn, just dry mulch this time of year because we grow our own stuff.

'I just dropped it [the produce] off and wrote the receipt in jest. I wanted to show my appreciation somehow because I do believe all the firefighters are absolute heroes. The least I could do is take some fruit up for them to eat,' Mr Golding said

'The smoke was so that thick and my oldest son has asthma so I had to send my wife and kids over to mum's place by 1pm on Saturday.' 

Mr Golding is one of many locals in the region providing small spirit-lifting donations to the fire crews battling the inferno, as well as its many victims. 

Boxes of chocolate bars were delivered to a CFS station at Nairne while the owners of the Hampshire Hotel  have offered free accommodation to anyone displaced by the fires.

Local woman Sarina Waterman has organised over 1000 free meals for  firefighters from the various food donations provided by residents, local supermarkets and even catering companies,The  Advertiser reports.

Over 12,000 hectares of land and 38 homes have been destroyed by the bushfires that began on Friday afternoon

Premier Jay Weatherill on Monday said the response to the fire was now focused on three key areas: containing the blaze; clearing roads to help restore services; and protecting more than 1000 homes in the fire zone which are 'surrounded by fuel that could ignite'.

The premier has confirmed that 38 homes have been destroyed or badly damaged - the number is expected to rise - as well as 129 other buildings and businesses. 

Hundreds of firefighters from across the country will continue to fight the blaze on Wednesday, with temperatures expected to soar.

Up to 123 people have been injured so far, 29 of whom are firefighters, The Guardian reports.
