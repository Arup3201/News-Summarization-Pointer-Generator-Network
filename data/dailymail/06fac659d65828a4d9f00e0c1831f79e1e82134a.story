A 'suspicious' fire which caused $100,000 worth of damage to a property in Perth has been deemed as suspected arson by West Australian police.

The home is believed to be owned by former footy player Daniel Kerr's estranged wife Natasha Pozo, the ABC reports. 

Firefighters were called to the residence at about 6.15pm on Monday after reports of a fire in the rear of the house.

Kerr, a retired West Coast Eagles footballer, previously made headlines after he was charged with two counts of endangering the life, health or safety of a person following an incident at a Glendalough property in Perth last year.

Kerr, a retired West Coast Eagles footballer, has spent time in prison after he was charged with two counts of endangering the life, health or safety of a person after an incident at a Glendalough property in Perth last year. The home (above) is believed to be owned by former footy player Daniel Kerr's estranged wife Natasha Pozo

Police say no one was inside the property on Harborne Street in Wembley, western Perth, during the fire yesterday however a male resident arrived at the scene a short time later.

Kerr, 31, has reportedly been residing at the home after being granted bail on previous charges, according to the ABC.

Department of Fire and Emergency Services' fire investigation officer told Daily Mail Australia it took firefighters 10 minutes to extinguish the 'suspicious' fire and most of the damage was caused by smoke.

Police say arson squad officers attended the scene and will continue their investigations into the incident.

Earlier this year, Kerr pleaded not guilty to his charges over allegations of splashing petrol around the property and throwing petrol at a man and a woman inside - before trying to set the property alight.

He recently had his bail conditions altered by the Perth Magistrates Court which gave him permission to move to Western Australia's south - Denmark - to play football for a local team, the ABC reports.

This comes as footage emerged of the moment fallen AFL star Ben Cousins was spotted driving erratically and running through the streets away from police, before he was taken into custody for the third time in two weeks.

Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media.
