An amazing video shows a man riding a giant fish like a horse in the Pacific Ocean.

Uploaded to YouTube July 30, the video shows a man riding a gigantic Mola in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico. The fish didn’t seem to mind the ride, and wasn’t hurt.

Mola can grow to 11 feet long and weigh 5,000 pounds, according to National Geographic. They are not dangerous to humans.

Massive: It's hard to believe anyone would think it's a good idea to ride a Mola, but they are not harmful to humans

Yee hah!: This fisherman rode a Mola fish like it was a horse

Shot by friends on a boat of the Mexican coast, the video first shows the cameraman jumping into the water and getting a close-up of the titanic fish. The fish rider soon jumps in next to the fish, it barely flinched.

'They started as strangers but ended up as good friends,' according to the video's description.

The video then shows the guy jumping on the back of the huge fish and riding like a horse. The fish appears to go in a circle before returning to the boat with the rider still on its back.

Looks good to me!: The two fisherman jumped in the water after seeing the Mola, with one filming while the other rode the giant beast around in a circle

Often referred to as the 'Ocean Sunfish,' the Mola is the largest boned fish in the world, according to NatGeo, and is usually covered in parasites and often lets birds or other fish eat them off it for relief. Because of this, the rider suffered barnacle burn, according to the video's description.

As the ride came to an end, the Mola’s rider thanked it for the trip by scrubbing some of the barnacles off, according to the video’s description.

The Mola returned to the boat several times after the ride, likely using the boaters as a cleaning station/backscratch, the description said.
