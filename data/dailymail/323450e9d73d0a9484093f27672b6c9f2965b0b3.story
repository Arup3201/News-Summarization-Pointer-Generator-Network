Former US solider 'Brett', pictured, has joined a Christian militia in Iraq to fight against ISIS 

A 28-year-old former US soldier has returned to Iraq as part of a militia defending one of the world's oldest Christian communities under threat from terror group ISIS. 

The man, known only as Brett, is one of the leading foreign fighters in the Dwekh Nawsha Christian militia. He had previously served in the US Army in Baghdad between 2006 and 2007.

Now, he is based in Al-Qosh, home of a mostly Christian population, which had been forced to flee into Kurdistan when ISIS fighters threatened to approach.

Brett describes himself as a crusader' with a tattoo of Jesus with a crown of thorns on one arm and a machine gun on the other. 

He is also responsible for recruiting fellow foreign fighters. 

ISIS was never able to capture Al-Qosh, but much of the population, like that in Mosul, which had a large Christian community, has also been forced to flee.  

Speaking from the Dwekh Nawsha stronghold in the Kurdish city of Dohuk, he said: 'One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. But here we're actually fighting for the freedom of the people here to be able live peaceably, to be able to live without persecution, to keep the church bells ringing.'

The mass exodus that took place in mid-2014 has put the continued existence of one of world's oldest Christian communities into question.

With Kurdish peshmerga fighters now clawing back land around Mosul, some Christians are keen to take up arms for their survival and Dwekh Nwasha is only one of several recently formed groups.

Thousands of westerners have been recruited into the ranks of ISIS, but many of those end up as 'cannon fodder' or suicide bombers to assist more valuable Chechen fighters. 

In his first week with responsibility for recruiting foreign fighters, he has identified five volunteers from the United States, Britain and Canada. Each of the five men has previous military experience or worked as private military contractors.

Brett's first recruit was a retired former US Marine from Texas called Louis Park.

He said: 'I did not adjust well at peace time. I wanted to get back out here.'

After serving in Afghanistan, Park says he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder 'and some other things' that barred him from combat deployments.

As early as October 2014, he began saving money to join the fight against ISIS.

Park says he travelled to Iraq to continue defending his country, even though Dwekh Nawsha - with barely a few hundred fighters in its ranks - sees little frontline action.

He said: 'I'm patriotic as hell. If my government won't fight them I will.'

The growing contingent of foreign recruits have a variety of reasons for joining Dwekh Nawsha.

Andrew, an older man from Ontario, Canada, came because he heard about 'slaughterhouses' where ISIS allegedly cuts people up for organ trafficking.

There is no evidence that such places exist but the rumour has been widely circulated by evangelical and anti-Islam organisations, especially in North America.

A video showing the beheading of 21 Coptic Christians by ISIS in Libya released on Sunday and entitled 'A message signed with blood to the nation of the cross' sparked a fresh surge of calls on social media for tougher Western action. 

One seven-year US army veteran called Scott said he was planning to join the Syria-based Kurdish 'Popular Protection Units' (YPG) until he found out they were 'a bunch of damn Reds'.

Other foreigners in Dwekh Nawsha say they were turned off by what they see as the socialist streak in the YPG, an affiliate of Turkey's Kurdistan Workers' Party whose months-long battle against ISIS in Kobane attracted many volunteers.

Thousands of Christians were forced to flee their homes after ISIS threatened to approach 

Alan Duncan, a prominent British foreign fighter and veteran of the Royal Irish Regiment, recently left the YPG for similar reasons.

He told AFP that an exodus of foreign fighters from the YPG has begun, naming several well-known volunteers currently fighting for the group he says plan to leave in the coming days.

Jordan Matson, a former US soldier who has become the poster boy of YPG foreign fighters, argued that some volunteers may have lost their bottle when confronted with the intensity of the fighting in Kobane.

'Most of the Internet cowboys have come to realise this isn't a normal deployment. So they lose the stomach to come or stay.' 

Louis admitted that he had been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress disorder by naval medics
