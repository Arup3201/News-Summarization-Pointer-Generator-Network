Two small airplanes apparently collided in midair over the Southern California mountains yesterday, sending one crashing into a rocky ridge while the second was able to maneuver a belly-flop landing on a nearby golf course.

Three people on the plane that landed on a fairway had minor injuries as stunned golfers looked on.

Rescuers searched for survivors from the fiery crash.

The plane that crashed was on an engine test flight, but authorities did not know how many people were onboard at the time of the crash.

Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer said a preliminary review of radar records showed the two flight-paths crossed just after 2 p.m.

A single-engine Cessna 172 carrying three people was flying west at an altitude of 3,500 feet when the second plane, also a Cessna 172, approached from the east after leaving Santa Monica Airport for a test flight.

The flights merged approximately 8 miles east northeast of Ventura, CA according to FAA radar data, Kenitzer said.

Both planes appeared to have hit the ground within minutes of each other and about 10 miles apart.The National Transportation Safety Board and FAA are investigating.

Shortly after 2 p.m., firefighters responding to a report of a small wildfire spotted aircraft debris on the charred site.

Los Angeles County Fire Department Inspector Quvondo Johnson said ground crews later confirmed that a small plane had crashed.

The body of the pilot was sighted on Monday evening in the crash area in rugged terrain near Mulholland Highway and Las Virgenes Road, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.

Rescue crews have 'identified the wreckage of a single-seat airplane with a single occupant who appears to be deceased,' said Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore.

The plane that crashed into the mountains sparked a fire that was quickly put out after burning about an acre of dry brush, officials said.

In the Westlake Village incident, the Cessna ended up in the middle of the third fairway.

Minor injuries: Three people on the cessna were taken to hospital

Investigation: The NTSB is now trying to find out what caused the crash on a clear cloudless California day

FAA records show the plane on the golf course is a four-seat Cessna 172 Skyhawk manufactured in 1980.

It's registered to Ameriflyers of Florida, LLC. A message left at a number listed for the company was not immediately returned.

Aaron Jesse, 47, said he had left work early to play golf with friends and saw the low-flying plane hit a tree, spin around 180 degrees and land surprisingly gently.

'Finally being a bad golfer paid off,' Jesse told the Los Angeles Times. 'I hit it in the trees to the right. They landed 50 feet to the left of us in the center of the fairway.

All we heard was a thud and then he made a gentle bounce and slid down the center of the fairway.'
