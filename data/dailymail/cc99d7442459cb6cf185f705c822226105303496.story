The 29-year-old man had more serious injuries and was transported the hospital via airlift, while the 59-year-old was taken in an ambulance.

They have undergone surgery and both remain in critical condtions. 

The police spokeswoman was unable to confirm if the two men had been involved in a fight but added they were not looking for a third person in relation to the incident.

Emergency services remain at the scene, and the nail gun has been recovered. 

Officers said as many of those who live at the temple speak Cambodian, the language barrier was making the investigation difficult.
