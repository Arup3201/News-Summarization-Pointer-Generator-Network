David Cameron today warned that trade unions present a 'threat to the economy' as he prepares to call in the armed forces to fill in for striking public sector workers.

But the Prime Minister faced claims that the strike-breaking idea will have 'serious consequences' for members of the armed forces and their families.

Ministers are in talks with service chiefs about how troops could cover for fuel taker drivers, firefighters, immigration staff, train and tube drivers and prison officers.

David Cameron told the Commons that the trade unions present a 'threat to the economy'.

They hope to replicate the success of the military protecting the public at the London Olympics after security firm G4S failed to recruit enough staff.

Union leaders have voted to explore the “practicalities” of a general strike for the first time since 1926.

David Cameron told the Commons today: 'The trade unions do provide a threat to our economy.

'They threatened a strike to stop our fuel supplies, they threatened a strike to disrupt the Olympics, now they threaten a strike to wreck the economy.'

He
 said Labour had received £12m since Ed Miliband became leader 'from the
 three unions who are now threatening a general strike' and said the party 
should turn down future donations if industrial action goes ahead.

The success of the military being called in to fill security shortfalls for the Olympics in London means they are to be put on standby to cover for public sector strikes.

'I do hope that these trade unions who are meeting and discussing this appalling idea of a general strike think again and think of the economy rather than their own self interest.'

But there are concerns among the military about the practicalities of covering for walkouts, as the forces face pay and job cuts.

Up to 17,000 jobs are due to be cut from the forces as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review.

Tory MP Penny Mordaunt, a member of the Commons defence select committee, today warned of the impact on members of the military and their families.

Tory MP Penny Mordaunt said the strike contingency plans would have 'serious consequences' for troops and their families.

‘We have to keep the country going, 
to keep public services running, but there are serious consequences for 
armed forces in terms of both their rest time and their training,' she told MailOnline.

'The armed forces have a pay freeze and are having to look after morale in the face of massive reorganisation.

‘It is incredibly disruptive to the armed forces.

I know they will rise to the challenge but one of the effects if you do have strikes – which will obviously be incredibly damaging for the country – is we are applying further stress on to these troops.

David Cameron has held talks with Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, over how the military could be used in the event of widespread industrial action.

‘The use of the Armed Forces to step 
in where there are strikes is a very political decision,’ former head of
 the Army, General Sir Mike Jackson told The Times.

‘By general acclaim the Armed 
Services were seen by the public to have done a pretty good job at the 
Olympics. It had the additional bonus that the relations between the 
Armed Services and the public have become stronger due to the job they 
did at the Olympics.’

The last time Downing Street revealed the army was on standby to fill in for striking workers, when petrol tanker drivers threatened to walk out in March, it sparked panic buying and severe shortages.

Mr Maude added to the chaos when he told  drivers: ‘As and when it makes sense, a bit of extra fuel in a jerry can is a sensible precaution to take.’

The need for contingency measures heightened yesterday after the TUC conference in Brighton voted to consider the practicalities of a general strike opposing the government’s austerity drive.

Steve Gillan, leader of the Prison Officers Association, which proposed the idea, said there had to be a 'robust' response, adding: 'It does not mean we will have a general strike tomorrow, but we should have that in our armoury, because this Government is not afraid or embarrassed to do what it is doing to society.

'We need to make up our mind which direction we are going in, and we should not be afraid to to mention the words general strike."

All members of the forces are to be put on seven days’ notice to cover for any emergency, The Times also reported.

The army has previously been trained to use Green Goddess fire engines to step in when firefighters went on strike.

Speaking during the Olympics, Mr Cameron praised the military’s role in providing security.

‘For the country's sake, I'm sure it was the right decision to call up almost more troops than we needed to make doubly certain that there wouldn't be any hiccups,’ the PM said.

It is not thought that members of the armed forces will be asked to cover for all public sector workers in the event of strikes. In particular, walk outs by nurses, doctors or teachers.

The National Union of Teachers has voted to go on strike over the 'erosion' of their pay and working conditions.

Outgoing TUC general secretary Brendan Barber has tried to play down the threat of a general strike.

'It would have enormous industrial and political implications,' he said.

A Government spokesman said: ‘It is disappointing that some union leaders insist on pushing for irresponsible and futile strike action which benefits no one.

'As we have said time and again, pension talks will not be reopened and nothing further will be achieved through strike action.

‘The Government took the tough decision to freeze public sector pay for two years, while protecting those earning under £21,000 by increasing their pay by at least £250 per year.

‘Pay restraint has helped to protect jobs in the public sector and support high quality public services.

'As always in the event of any industrial action rigorous contingency planning would be in place across all sectors to minimise the impact of any strike and to ensure that key public services remain open.'
