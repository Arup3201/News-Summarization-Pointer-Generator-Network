The creator of the eccentric hipster hotel chain Ace has been found dead in a room of his London hotel. 

The cause of Alex Calderwood's death is unclear- his body was discovered on Thursday afternoon in his Shoreditch hotel, east London - six weeks after its opening in September.

Calderwood, 47, was known to have had issues with addiction - he had previously spent time in rehab and said in a 2011 interview he had been sober for five months.

His quirky brand, which has hotels in major cities across the U.S. and one in Britain, is renowned for its style, with vintage and recondtioned furniture and street art decorating the rooms.

Visionary? Alex Calderwood, 47, was found dead in his London hotel Thursday. He considered himself a 'cultural engineer'

The company confirmed the death on 
its website and called Calderwood 'our teacher, mentor, guru and most 
importantly our dear friend.'

'It's just too early to talk about it,' said spokesman, Ryan Bukstein to The Seattle Times.

'We're all in mourning,' he said.

The company, however, would not comment on a possible cause of death.

An ambulance was called when his body was found on Thursday at the hotel, which has been billed as one of his most ambitious projects to date.

A hotel staff member at the London hotel told The Daily Beast:
'It’s just very shocking. We are all in shock.
He was so young, it was totally unexpected. But we don’t really know 
what happened.'

The New York Times, reported in a 2011 interview that Calderwood had spent time in rehab.

He was forced to address the problem publicly after one of his former business partners said his drinking exacerbated problems that led to them parting ways.

Calderwood said at the time: 'I am very proud of my sobriety…You get to a certain
age, and you get to a certain point, where you realize this is just, 
like, dragging me down. It’s not fun anymore. I’m not enjoying it.'

Calderwood made a name for himself for having an eccentric style that permeated his work.

His super trendy hotels became popular with celebrities, artists and young professionals alike.

His long, curly mop head of hair made him instantly recognizable. He loved graphic designers Lou Dorfsman and Milton Glaser. He was usually spotted in public in a t-shirt, jeans and Converse sneakers.

He was such a fan of Converse that the shoe company invited him to design a pair. They had a distinctly retro feel.

Despite frequently being labeled a 'hipster' for his vintage design aesthetic, he hated the term.

His business card bore the job title 'cultural engineer.'

He told Entrepreneur magazine in 2011: 'It's important to not chase after cool ... Do something that has substance and is very personal.'

In 1999, he and two friends launched Seattle's Ace Hotel in a flophouse that formerly served maritime workers.

Alex Calderwood and his business partners opened the first Ace Hotel in an old flophouse in Seattle in 1999.

The accommodation, in a rapidly-gentrifying neighborhood, was long on style and short on price - $65 a night for a basic room with a communal bathroom.

The idea took off and Calderwood opened a second Ace Hotel in Portland, Oregon in 2007.

In 2009, the venture expanded to Palm Springs, California and the following year in the trendy Flat Iron District of New York City.

Two months ago, Calderwood opened his fifth hotel - his first international property - in the hip Shoreditch neighborhood in London.

The company has two more properties planned - Los Angeles and Panama City, Panama.

Calderwood aspired to create more than just a hotel - he wanted a lifestyle experience at Ace.

The spacious lobby of the New York City outpost is often full of people who stop in to visit the Sumptown Coffee or the Michelin star-rated restaurant.

It's renowned for its much-imitated 
style and 
guestroom art by Shepard Fairey - who later became famous for creating 
the 'HOPE' poster that came to symbolize Barack Obama's 2008 
presidential campaign. 

But one of his partners Jack Barron, an architect withdrew from the project after differences with Calderwood and the backers.

The New York Times reported Mr Barron said Calderwood’s 'drinking didn’t exactly help.'

Ace
Hotels later opened in Portland, Oregon; New York; Palm Springs, California; 
and London, with others scheduled to open late this year or early next 
year in Panama City, Panama, and Los Angeles.

Ace, in which a loft suite can cost $2,000 a night, describes itself on its website 
as 'a collection of individuals - multiple and inclusive, held together 
by an affinity for the soulful.'

'We
try to do unexpected things from a design standpoint,' Calderwood told 
The New York Times in 2008. 'We want to celebrate the everyday with 
utilitarian objects.'

Calderwood grew up in Seattle's eastside suburbs.

Born in Denver, he was the son of a contractor and a newspaper columnist.

Calderwood
is survived by his parents, Thomas and Kathleen Calderwood of Seattle; 
two sisters, Donna Roberts and Tahnee Ferry; and a brother, Tim 
Calderwood.

Just out of high school, he began managing a Seattle clothing store 
called International News. He used material from a Boeing Co. surplus 
store to create fixtures, desks and other parts of a showroom, Amit 
Shah, who hired him, told The Seattle Times.

Rudy's Barbershop at the Ace Hotel in New York City is just one of Calderwood's many establishments

'He
saw what you could do with material that nobody else wanted,' Shah 
said. 'He always had a desire to come up with something new that gave 
consumers value for their money. He was an entrepreneur and knew how to 
entertain, but more than that, he was always willing to talk about what 
the new thing was.'

In
1993, Calderwood and two partners started a Seattle chain of 
rock-themed barbershops called Rudy's. The stores were a hit, and there 
are now eight of them in Seattle and nine others spread through in 
Portland, New York and Los Angeles.

He went on to open a popular Seattle nightclub before becoming a hotelier.

Ryan
Bukstein, Ace's director of public relations and marketing, said he had
been working for the company for 14 years, since starting as an intern 
while in college.

Calderwood was his friend and mentor, he said.

'His
humility, spirit of collaboration and tireless work ethic has 
influenced our family at Atelier Ace and creatives across the globe,' 
Bukstein wrote in an email Sunday.

'We all plan to continue moving 
forward with the ideals Alex championed so naturally.'
