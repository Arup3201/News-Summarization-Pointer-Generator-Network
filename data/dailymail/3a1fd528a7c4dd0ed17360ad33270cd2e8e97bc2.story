Mystery man: 'John Smith' woke up in Oslo in December with no recollection of who he is or where he came from

A man who was discovered in a snowdrift in the Norwegian capital Oslo in December not knowing who he was or how he even got there claims that he was sexually assaulted, robbed – and was the victim of attempted murder.

The claim was made as a Czech couple identified him as their son.

The mystery man, who calls himself John Smith but does not know his real name, was found with a cocktail of drugs in his system and cuts on his wrist suggesting they had been strapped.

He said on Wednesday that he believes he has been the victim of a violent crime.

He told AFP: ‘What apparently has happened is that I was robbed, I was for sure sexually assaulted, and then I was thrown onto a street in Oslo.

‘What might have happened is that they took advantage of the fact that Europe has open borders - this amazing European invention - and that they basically used Oslo as a garbage place to dump me.’

He told TV2 that evidence suggests he may have been kept locked up, with his hands tied, for several days without any food or water.

‘I'm afraid,’ he said. ‘It's my opinion they tried to kill me.’

A Czech couple, meanwhile, have stepped forward and declared that they're the parents of the man, who is believed to be 36 years old.

He told Norwegian broadcaster TV2 he was excited about the news and it feels like ‘he is about to be rescued from hell.’

The couple’s claim tallies to an extent with the man’s initial thoughts that he understands the Czech language best. He also understands Slovak, Polish and Russian and speaks with a heavy Russian accent.

Police said they will now seek to confirm the man's identity with DNA comparisons and are also investigating if he has been a crime victim.

Czech police said it's still unclear why the man was in Norway.
