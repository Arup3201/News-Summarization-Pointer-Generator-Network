A gang of a dozen youths ransacked 45 mobile phone shops, wrenching handsets and tablets worth hundreds of thousands of pounds from displays, a court has heard.

They 'steamed' into stores across London in a three-month spree last summer, Croydon Crown Court heard.

Innocent members of the public were often caught up in the fracas, as the gang pushed them out of the way after rushing into the shop, crowding into customers, and violently wrenching the stock from displays complete with wires.
