Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United will open the Premier League season after their home fixture with Swansea City was chosen for live, lunchtime coverage on BT Sport.

Sky Sports’ decision to select matches involving the top four from last season has allowed BT to land Van Gaal’s first match in charge of United, which will kick off at 12.45pm on Saturday August 16.

Sky, meanwhile, will broadcast champions Manchester City’s trip to Newcastle United (Sunday August 17, 4pm), Arsenal versus Crystal Palace (Saturday, 5.30pm), Liverpool’s visit of Southampton (Sunday, 1.30pm) and Chelsea at Burnley (Monday August 18, 8pm).

But many will feel BT have scooped the
 prize match with Van Gaal’s debut in the dugout the most-anticipated 
fixture of the weekend.

United’s curtain-raiser against the 
Swans should also mark the debut of Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera in a red
 shirt, and there could well be more by time the action gets underway, 
including Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal who is thought to be nearing a
 move to Old Trafford.

Sky Sports, though, have no shortage 
of intrigue in their picks and Liverpool versus Southampton has added 
spice given the likelihood of former Saints Adam Lallana and Rickie 
Lambert making their bow against their old club.

Chelsea could include Cesc Fabregas 
for their trip to newly-promoted Burnley during the season’s first 
Monday Night Football, while the debut of Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez 
against Crystal Palace on Saturday tea-time is sure to attract interest 
following his £30m move from Barcelona.
