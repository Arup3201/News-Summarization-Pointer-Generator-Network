The Deputy Director of the Secret Service has been reassigned within the Department of Homeland Security, the agency said Monday. 

A 29-year-veteran of the government's security arm, A.T. Smith is stepping down from his position as the second-highest ranking Secret Service officer in the latest shake up at the agency as it reinvents itself in the wake of numerous high-profile security breaches involving the president.

At least five other Secret Service officials have been ordered to seek other positions within DHS or retire in the last several weeks, and the director of the Secret Service was dismissed last fall.

OUT: A 29-year-veteran of the government's security arm, A.T. Smith is stepping down from his position as the second-highest ranking Secret Service officer in the latest shake up at the agency as it reinvents itself in the wake of numerous high-profile security breaches involving the president

Smith, who had been deputy director since 2012, was in charge of day-to-day operations at the agency and managing its 6,500 employees.

'Deputy Director Smith has had an exceptional law enforcement career,' Acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy said in a statement on Monday. 'His contributions to the agency have been invaluable. I salute his distinguished service to the Secret Service and the nation.'

Clancy and Smith were scheduled to update the House Government and Oversight Committee on Thursday on the agency's ongoing review of internal operations.

In light of today's news, the committee's chairman, Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, and ranking member, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, said in a joint statement the hearing had been postponed.

Chaffetz, a Republican, had called for Smith's firing over departmental issues, including an incident detailed in an October inspector general report in which Smith pulled agents off the White House and sent them to the Maryland home of an agency employee feuding with a neighbor.

'Last week, we met jointly with the White House Counsel and the Department of Homeland Security and expressed our shared conviction that the Secret Service needs to turn the page with respect to its senior leadership,' Chaffetz and Cummings said in their statement today. 

'We commend the Department for its numerous personnel actions last month, as well as its recent decision to transfer the Deputy Director out of the agency.'

The congressmen said they were pushing Thursday's committee hearing to give Clancy more time and 'to ensure that he is able to focus on bolstering the Secret Service’s core mission of protecting the President, his family, and numerous other officials and dignitaries.'

'We thank the hardworking men and women of the Secret Service for remaining committed to their incredibly important work,' they added.

A member of the Secret Service's Uniformed Division sits in his car on Pennsylvania Avenue outside the White House on January 26. A small aerial drone was found on the grounds of the White House earlier that morning. The drone posed no threat but the incident dredged up concerns about White House protection among lawmakers

In January, Clancy gave four assistant agents pink slips, allowing them to obtain other employment in Homeland Security, the parent department of the Secret Service, within in the next month rather than firing them outright.

The four officers - Mark Copanzzi, Paul Morrissey, Jane Murphy, and Dale Pupillo - oversaw the agency's missions of protection, investigations, technology and public affairs. 

Another assistant director, this one in charge of the Secret Service's training wing, Vic Erevia, opted to retire.

DHS is still reviewing candidates to serve as permanent director of the Secret Service.

Clancy, a retired agent who previously served in the president's detail and is currently on leave from a job in the private sector, is reportedly in the mix of candidates to succeed Julia Pierson, the disgraced former head of the agency who resigned last year a man wielding a knife jumped the fence outside the White House and made it inside the building.

According to the New York Times, other interviewees for the top post include Sean Joyce, a former deputy director of the FBI, Terrance Gainer, the former chief of the Capitol Police, and Cathy Lanier, an officer with the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. 

While Clancy, who was hand picked by President Barack Obama to lead the agency after Pierson's departure, may appear to be the obvious choice for director, a DHS report following the security lapses last year recommended an agency outsider be brought in to make reforms. 

Homeland Security Secretary Eric Holder said Sunday that a decision would come 'pretty soon.' 

Just last month a man was able to crash land a drone on the 1600 Pennsylvania lawn in the middle of the night. 

The drone's owner said it was accident, and the White House immediately confirmed that the two-foot long quadcopter posed no threat. But the incident dredged up concerns about White House protection among lawmakers.
