Marketing for the $125 million epic film Noah has been tweaked to appease religious groups who complained that its plot had strayed from the biblical story.

Paramount has agreed to include a message with all trailers and posters for the film, which stars Russell Crowe, Anthony Hopkins, and Emma Watson.

The gesture of goodwill came after the head of the National Religious Broadcasters appealed for the studio to make clear that the plot was a creative interpretation of the Genesis story.

Plot point: Advertising for Noah, starring Russell Crowe, is to carry a disclaimer to please religious groups

Message: Paramount is adding a note to promotional material and the film website, pictured, to state the plot was inspired by the biblical story

The Darren Aronofsky film, due to be released at the end of March, stars Crowe as Noah - a man suffering from apocalyptic visions who goes to extraordinary lengths to protect his family.

Under the marketing agreement, all promotional material will now include the following message: 'The film is inspired by the story of 
Noah. While artistic license has been taken, we believe that this film 
is true to the essence, values and integrity of a story that is a 
cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide. The biblical 
story of Noah can be found in the book of Genesis.'

The message was added after Jerry Johnson, president of The National Religious Broadcasters, contacted Paramount after a panel from his group watched clips from the film in Nashville.Â 

The panel discussed the film's interpretation to the biblical text, and raised concerns about any differences.

'We are deeply appreciative of Dr 
Johnson's efforts to bring this idea to us,' Paramount Picture's vice-chairman Rob Moore told Hollywood Reporter.

Star cast: Anthony Hopkins is among the A-lister actors featured in the film

Epic: Noah, starring Crowe, above, was described by director Darren Aronofsky as the first apocalyptic film

Modern message: Emma Watson plays Noah's adopted daughter in the film, which its director has said reflects environmental concerns

'Our goal has been to take every measure we 
can to ensure moviegoers have the information they need before deciding 
to buy a ticket to see the film.'

Johnson said he was pleased with the response from the studios, adding: 'We
 are grateful that Paramount is striving, with this disclaimer, to 
strike a proper balance between artistic creativity, character 
development and honoring the sacred Scripture.'

Aronofsky, who directed the Oscar-winning Black Swan, described the story of Noah as the first apocalypse story, and said he was keen to portray a more adult version of what had become a children's tale.

Changes: A Christian group contacted Paramount to ask for a message to be added to the film's promotional material

'The first thing I said to Russell Crowe was, "I'll never shoot you on a houseboat with two giraffes standing behind you",' he told Rolling Stone.

'We tried to remain truthful to the themes and the ideas that are written, but to create a dramatic story for a 21st-century audience.'

When posters for the film were released, showing Crowe holding an axe, comparisons were drawn with the Mad Max movies.

Aronofsk, who filmed the big-budget movie in Oyster Bay, Long Island, has said previously he was drawn to the story because of its environmental message.
