The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence - SETI - project looks for alien life in a one, main specific way - scanning for radio signals deliberately beamed towards earth from distant stars.

But two astronomers suggest that we may be missing evidence much closer to home.

Two scientists at Arizona State University have suggested that alien life may have 'left traces on the moon in the form of an artifact or surface modification of lunar features' - and that alien 'footprints' on the moon would last far longer than radio signals.

The detailed moon maps created by Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter may be the best place to look for alien life, say scientists - evidence such as trails or debris would remain there for millions of years, and be easier to 'catch' than radio signals

'Evidence for extraterrestrial intelligence could come from any signatures of non-human technology,' say the scientists in a paper published in Acta Astronautica.

The scientists say that any alien mission to our solar system is liable to have occurred long ago - but that the surface of the moon could preserve the signs for millions of years.

The photographs already captured by Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter - currently mapping the moon's surface to 0.5m resolution - provides an easy, cheap way to look for these signs.

'Although there is only a tiny 
probability that alien technology would have left traces on the moon in 
the form of an artifact or surface modification of lunar features, it has the virtue of being close, and of preserving traces for an 
immense duration.'

Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is mapping the moon to 0.5m resolution - the scientists suggest that the huge number of images from the orbiter could be a good starting place for a search for alien life

'The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) would have a high impact if successful,' say the scientists, in a paper published in Acta Astronautica.

'Therefore it makes sense to widen the search as much as possible. To date, SETI has been dominated by seeking deliberately beamed radio messages.'
