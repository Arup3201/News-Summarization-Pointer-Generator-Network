Road to recovery: Richard Bamber, 37, was left dangling in agony after he became impaled on an iron railing in Birmingham on Saturday

A DJ who was left impaled on iron railings after he attempted to scale an 8ft-high fence while 'a bit drunk' today revealed that he suffered almost exactly the same mishap as a child.

Richard Bamber, 37, was left dangling in agony after he became impaled on a jagged spike near luxury flats in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter on Saturday morning.

He spent the next 15 hours with a railing embedded in his leg while doctors worked out how to safely remove it.

Incredibly, this is not the first time Mr Bamber has impaled himself on an iron railing having been speared through the armpit at the age of five in a similar accident.

He said: 'The funny thing is that I did do something similar when I was five. I was leaning against some railings near my home in order to get a better look at the nearby trainline and I just slipped.

'That time I was able to free myself and I went home and told my mum that I had hurt my arm.

'When she looked, there was a perfect hole in my armpit. I suppose I should have learned my lesson then.'

During Saturday's incident, the railing was just inches from several major arteries and could have pierced a vital organ.

But after a one-hour operation to remove it on Sunday, Mr Bamber was back home on Monday night.

A fork-lift truck driver by day and DJ by night, he got trapped in the car park after leaving a friend's flat before deciding to scale the iron fence.

He said: 'I was a bit drunk and I just took a look at this fence and thought, "Yeah, I can make that."

'There was a wooden bit at 90 degrees to the fence so I got up on that first with the intention of leaping over but, obviously, I underestimated the gap.

'At first I thought I had just caught myself on something. It was a bit like when toddlers fall over and it takes them a few seconds before they start to cry.

'I didn’t feel anything until I looked down and saw what I'd done.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, I just thought "Oh no, you’ve actually done it."'

Painful: The iron railing remained stuck in Mr Bamber's leg for 15 hours before doctors could operate to remove it

Several passers-by were alerted by Mr Bamber's cries for help. One man even helped to support him while they waited for assistance and then the paramedics took over.

Mr Bamber said: 'At first it really hurt but I think after a while I got used to it because I remember having a bit of a joke with this chap while he was trying to hold me up.

'After that everything is a bit of a blur. The paramedics arrived and pumped me full of drugs so I couldn’t feel anything. I wasn’t even aware that they had set me on fire trying to get me off the fence.'

He only heard later from friends that the extremely hot cutting tools used to remove the iron railing had set fire to a blanket used to keep his legs warm.

However, he does remember a crowd forming around the scene as it took emergency workers around half an hour to release him from the fence.

Emergency crews were forced to call on the help of the Specialist Technical Rescue Team - who used hot gas cutting tools and an angle grinder to remove a section of the railings.

The street was closed off as the emergency services carried out the rescue.

Once free, the Mr Bamber was placed on a stretcher and taken to hospital.

He said: 'It’s pretty embarrassing. I’ll no doubt get some stick off my mates.

'The
accident happened at around 9am and it was midnight by the time I was 
taken into surgery, so I was laid on a hospital trolley with this big 
metal railing sticking out of my leg for a long time.

'I
didn’t feel much and I don’t remember much because of all the drugs 
they had given me. The doctors said they were hopeful that the railing 
would come out pretty easily but they needed to be sure what kind of 
damage it had done.'

Mr 
Bamber was discharged from Sandwell General Hospital yesterday afternoon
and, while his leg remains sore,  he is still able to hobble about.

However, he knows he has had a lucky escape.

He
said: 'It seems strange to say I’m lucky to be alive but I suppose I 
am. It could easily have been much worse. I’m just thankful there were 
people around to come to my aid quickly.

'It’s not bad - I can still get about and walk up and down the stairs and things.'

Close call: The horrifying incident happened near to Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter

Mr
Bamber's mother Shirley said she only found out about her son's latest 
scrape on Sunday night as he had not wanted to worry her.

Shirley
Bamber, 76, said: 'Richard has always been very accident prone. I can’t
believe he’s been impaled on railings for the second time in his 
life.”'

A West Midlands 
Ambulance Service spokesman said of the incident: 'Crews arrived to find
a man who had fallen onto a fence. The man had been impaled by one of 
the spikes of the fence into his thigh.

'The
spike remained in situ and was cut using specialist cutting equipment. 
The man was trapped on the fence for around one hour whilst he was 
safely removed.

'The man 
received pain relief and was transported by land ambulance with the 
spike still in his leg to City Hospital for further emergency 
treatment.'
