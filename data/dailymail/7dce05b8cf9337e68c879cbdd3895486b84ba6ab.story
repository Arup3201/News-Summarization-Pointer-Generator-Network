Look away Paul Robinson and Gary Neville, unless you want flashbacks of a certain night  in Zagreb, Croatia, on October 11, 2006.

There in the Euro 2008 qualifying match, a bobble at the Maksimir Stadium caused England defender Neville's back-pass to outwit goalkeeper Robinson for an own goal in the 2-0 defeat.

But Olimpija left-back Matic Fink and goalkeeper Aleksander Seliga feel their pain after producing their own sorry and equally ridiculous version in the Slovenian PrvaLiga.

Seliga misses the ball completely as it creeps towards the goal during the Slovenian PrvaLiga match

Fink's innocuous back-pass to Seliga ends up in the  net after an unfortunate bobble - with the goalkeeper quickly trying to recover the runaway ball as it creeps towards the goal. 

He fails to do so, and fourth-top Olimpija suffer a shock defeat against strugglers Krka 2-1.

Still, at least Fink and Seliga didn't do it live on television and in front of 38,000 fans...
