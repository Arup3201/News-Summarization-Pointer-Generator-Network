She has only been in power for a few weeks but Spain's new Queen Letizia has barely had 
time to catch her breath following the coronation as she keeps busy 
with her royal duties.

Today her non-stop schedule continued as she attended an event to mark the 150th anniversary of Spain's Red Cross.

The beloved monarch was mobbed by adoring Spaniards as she took part in a Madrid ceremony to commemorate the work done by the humanitarian organisation.

Adored: Queen Letizia was mobbed by a crowd of people during a ceremony commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Red Cross in Spain. She handled the situation with her trademark grace and composure

Elegant: The Spanish monarch looked sleek and stylish in a classic white jacket and simple pearl drop earrings. Her schedule has been non-stop in the two weeks since her husband's coronation

Tribute: The Spanish monarch delivers a speech at the event, commemorating the work done by the Spanish Red Cross - or Cruz Roja

She handled the attention with her trademark composure and grace - taking the time to smile and chat with adoring well-wishers.

Once inside, Letizia took to the stage to deliver a speech, paying tribute to the organisation's valuable work in times of crisis.

The Spanish monarch looked chic and stylish for the event, dressed in a classic cream jacket and tailored navy trousers.

This is not the first time that Letizia has come out in support of the organisation - she attended fundraising events while she was Crown Princess of Spain.

It's already been a busy week for the newly appointed Queen, just yesterday she and husband King Felipe delivered scholarships at 
Iberdrola Foundation at Casa America in Madrid.

On Wednesday the royal couple were on a visit to the Spanish Design and Innovation Awards in Valladolid.

On Tuesday, the pair met the Pope. King
 Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, wore white as is standard protocol for a
 queen visiting the pope, were greeted by Francis in the papal library.

A final wave: Before getting in her car, Queen Letizia turns around and waves goodbye to the crowds of people who came out to catch a glimpse of her

Human touch: The new Queen shakes hands with a Red Cross worker as she looks as stalls demonstrating the organisation's valuable humanitarian work. The former TV presenter married King Felipe VI ten years ago

Last week Queen Letizia flaunted a new hairstyle, which gave the appearance of a
 swish bob, at the Prince of Girona Awards ceremony held at the Palacio
 de Congresos of Girona in Catalonia.

It wasn't clear whether the glamorous Royal had gone for the chop and cut 
off her luscious locks - or whether she was fooling us with clever 
styling, and had simply twisted her flowing hair under, and pinned it.

Today and yesterday's appearances proves that it was just a nifty stylist trick as she 
showcased her usual flowing caramel hair on a visit to meet Pope Francis
 at the Vatican.

Warm welcome: The Spanish monarch is greeted with a standing ovation as she is introduced at the event. During the day Queen Letizia took to the stage to deliver a speech honouring the work of the Red Cross

Radiant: Queen Letizia looked happy and relaxed as she attends the Red Cross event. Earlier this week she and husband King Felipe VI were received by Pope Francis in the papal library

Friendly: Letizia shares a smile with Red Cross workers as she arrives at the Palacio Municipal de Congresos - a Madrid convention centre - for the event

Francis
 had met Felipe's parents, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, on several 
occasions, the last time during the April 27 canonizations of Saints 
John Paul II and John XXIII. Juan Carlos abdicated earlier this month.

It
 has been a busy few weeks for the 41-year-old. Since becoming Queen she
 has attended numerous public events, but this is one of the first she has attended on her own.

Since being appointed Queen, Letizia and her husband have attended a number of events in support of charity and community projects - winning over the hearts and minds of Spain.

Gracious: Queen Letizia (centre) poses for a photo with members of the Red Cross, an organisation that she has supported through fundraising events  for several years

Exchanging gifts: Queen Letizia and King Felipe were greeted by Pope Francis in the papal library on Tuesday. It is the first time the King had met with the pope since his coronation

Busy schedule: Yesterday Queen Letizia accompanied her husband King Felipe VI to deliver scholarships at Iberdrola Foundation at Casa America in Madrid. She looked fresh in a white jacket and yellow trousers

Letizia Ortiz, from Asturias in the north
west of Spain, married Prince Felipe de Borbon ten years ago at 
Cathedral Santa María la Real de la Almudena in Madrid.

The
couple began their relationship in November 2002 when they encountered 
one another while she was on assignment, covering a story about an oil 
spillage in Northern Spain.

Felipe – who had met Letizia before at a 
dinner party – was there representing the Spanish royal family, and the 
two started a romantic relationship.

Letizia shops at the supermarket and champions Spanish high street 
fashion brands such as Zara and Mango, as well as couturiers such as Felipe Varela and Lorenzo Caprile.

She regularly tops best-dressed lists in her own country and worldwide.
