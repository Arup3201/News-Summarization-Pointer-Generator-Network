Russell Brand has blamed the disgraced Chelsea fans' racist thuggery in Paris on football's recent £5 billion TV rights deal 

Millionaire comedian and self-styled anarchist Russell Brand has blamed the disgraced Chelsea fans’ racist thuggery in Paris on football’s recent £5 billion TV rights deal.

‘If you treat fans like they don’t matter, like they’re not worthy of grace, then it isn’t surprising that some behave disgracefully,’ writes Brand on his blog, under the heading ‘£5.1bn a high price for racism?’

‘When fans take back the clubs that are theirs, and run them collectively, aberrant acts like the Metro racism can be communally condemned from a just position, not the altar of cold profiteering and cunning hypocrisy.’

However, he insisted he was not trying to excuse racism. Brand, 39, a West Ham supporter, accused the Premier League of ‘garnering huge wealth and hogging it for itself’, rather than ‘sharing the bounty with fans’.

His comments sparked outrage among some blog followers. One called him a ‘damn hypocrite’ while another described him as ‘a fraud’. Others defended the comic.

Responding to Brand, a Premier League spokesman said: ‘Regardless of ownership models, racist behaviour is not acceptable as part of the game or society.’

Meanwhile, police have launched a new investigation into fresh racism allegations against Chelsea supporters. CCTV recordings are being studied for evidence of abusive chanting by fans at London’s St Pancras Station.

They were returning from the club’s Champions League game against Paris St Germain last week, where a group of Chelsea fans had been filmed pushing a black man off a Paris Metro train. So far Chelsea has suspended five men from its Stamford Bridge ground. The Met Police has released three photos of suspects. None has been named by police although supporters have identified five as either witnesses or participants.

They are Josh Parsons, a 21-year-old City worker, and his younger brother, Benji; Jordan Munday, 20; Mitchell McCoy, 17; and 23-year-old Jamie Fairbairn.
