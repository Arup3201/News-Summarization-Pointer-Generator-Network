A white monocled cobra that briefly became a national celebrity after it roamed a Southern California neighborhood for several days in September now has a new name.

The San Diego Zoo tells the Los Angeles Times that the cobra will be called Adhira, which in Hindi means lightning.

The Times says Adhira came in first in an online poll to find a name for the venomous cobra that was captured in Thousand Oaks and, after a period of quarantine, joined the zoo's Reptile House.

New name: A white monocled cobra that briefly became a national celebrity after it roamed a California neighborhood for several days in September has been named Adhira, which in Hindi means lightning

Adhira received 4,612 votes, besting Sapheda (white), Krima (cream), Cini (Sugar), Moti (pearl) and Sundara (beautiful). Selected by the cobra's keepers, the names were meant to reflect the Southeast Asia region where cobras are native.

The Times says the snake went on exhibit December 23. 

The cobra, a female, is 4 feet long and is around two years old.

How it came to roam Thousand Oaks for those few days in September is still a mystery.

According to BBC  Monocled cobras are timid and yet very dangerous snakes, with a strong toxin that can kill someone if they are not treated

 What makes the monocled cobra especially dangerous is the way they repeatedly strike, like lighting, when excited and thereby inject more venom. 

Monocled cobras typically prey on the rodents, amphibians and reptiles of Southeast Asia.

Mystery: Adhira mysteriously roamed a Southern California neighborhood for days in September before being captured and given her name 

In captivity: The venomous snake is now on display at the San Diego, California zoo
