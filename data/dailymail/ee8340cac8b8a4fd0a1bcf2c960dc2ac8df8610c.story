Loss: Preston Flores suffered 80 per cent burns after being set on fire in Aberdeen

A seven-year-old boy who was badly burned in a street in
Aberdeen on Friday has died in hospital, police said.

Preston Flores ran into the street ‘on fire’ near his home after his clothes became doused in petrol and ignited on Saturday.

The youngster, who is thought to have suffered 80 per cent burns, may have been deliberately set on fire – or been the victim of a prank gone wrong.

Preston's mother Luisza said in a statement on behalf of the family: 'Preston's family want to inform the public that their precious little boy has passed away and is at rest.

'He meant the world to his family and will always be deeply missed and loved. Preston was a special little boy and his loss has ripped our family apart.'

Luisza added: 'On behalf of our family I would like to thank everyone for their support but would ask that we are now allowed to grieve in peace for Preston.'

Detective Inspector Lorna Ferguson of 
Police Scotland said: 'Our thoughts are with Preston’s family, friends 
and the Bedford Community at this sad time.'

Officers are investigating whether petrol was involved but say there is no suggestion that the youngster was the victim of a deliberate act.

A report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal in due course as is usual procedure.

The youngster was taken to hospital in Aberdeen before being transferred to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh where he died today.

Preston was a pupil at Sunnybank School in Aberdeen. Its acting headteacher, Michelle McKay, said: 'Preston was a lively and competitive little boy who loved football, PE and all sorts of outdoor activities, as well as board games, baking and building with Lego.

'He was a fun-loving boy with a great sense of humour and lots of friends. He loved his family too, and was always sharing with us the latest news about his new baby brother.

'This is a tragic time for his family, for the school and for everyone connected to it. We are all so saddened by what has happened.

His mother said: 'Preston was a special little boy and his loss has ripped our family apart'

'This is a strong and close-knit community, however, and so we are all supporting each other and I am sure that, together, we will find ways of coming to terms with our loss.'

Eyewitnesses told how they watched in 
horror as the boy, screaming in agony, suddenly appeared with flames covering one side of his body.

One
 described the shocking scene as Preston was on fire from the neck 
downwards, his clothes sticking to him as he lay terrified on the 
ground.

Another said someone
 handed the youngster a bucket of water, which he immediately poured 
over himself in a  desperate attempt to put out the fire.

Victoria
 Pirie, 17, last night told how she heard screams as the boy ran into 
the back garden of his block of flats, yelling and crying.

She said: ‘It was just horrid. He was on fire from the neck downwards, his clothes were sticking to him.

'They weren’t really big but they were enough to do a lot of damage to him.’

Earlier, the schoolboy had been outside enjoying the fine weather, playing with two friends, a boy and a girl, in the street near his home.

The tragedy happened shortly before 2pm yesterday afternoon.

Local resident Paulina Pilska said she had been watching the children from her window as they jumped on top of a council pick-up van.

The 25-year-old cleaner said: ‘They were searching for something. I saw one of them with a container, like a watering can.’

The schoolboy was seriously hurt in the incident in Bedford Avenue, Aberdeen

Minutes later, Preston was running around outside the block of flats with flames shooting from his clothes.

Miss
 Pilska said the other children were trying to put him on the ground but
 he was shouting, although not very loudly at that stage.

She added: ‘I was shocked.'

Shortly
 afterwards, his mother Luisza, who had just returned to their flat from the 
shops, learned of the accident after neighbours began banging on her 
door. Residents said the mother-of-five collapsed on the ground when she
 saw her son.

Paramedics gave her oxygen and she was taken away in the ambulance with young Preston.

Police
 cordoned off two streets as they carried out detailed investigations to
 establish the exact circumstances surrounding the tragedy.

As
 stunned neighbours huddled together, some in tears, they watched police
 officers scour a grassy lane between two blocks of flats.

Resident Shona Henderson, 16, said: ‘I saw clothes lying all over the ground and his shoes and the fire still there.

Emergency crews were called to the scene shortly before 2pm and he was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for treatment

Shocked local resident Paulina Pilska said she watched the boy running from the side of a building with flames all over one side of his body

‘By the time we got there, his clothes were sticking to his skin, it looked like they had melted into his skin. It was horrible.

‘There
 were lots of people around him. Someone handed him a bucket of water 
and he poured it all over himself. He was screaming.’

Preston
 was taken by an ambulance under police escort to the Royal Aberdeen 
Children’s Hospital, where medical staff carried out emergency surgery.

Residents said the boy is believed to have had fuel on his clothes which somehow ignited
