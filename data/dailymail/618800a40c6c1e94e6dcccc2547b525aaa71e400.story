Hundreds of people gathered amid tears and song for several vigils remembering the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing on Tuesday, notably 8-year Martin Richard and 29-year-old Kyrstle Campbell who lost their lives on Monday.

In Garvey Park, near the home of Martin, candles glowing inside plastic cups swayed among small American flags as tear-stained attendees remembered the tiny boy who once held up his own handmade sign in school reading: 'No more hurting people. Peace.'

The boy was one of three killed and more than 170 people injured in the bombings near the end of the race.

Martin's younger sister, Jane, lost a leg in the explosion and his mother Denise is in hospital after undergoing brain surgery. Martin's older brother, 12-year-old Henry, escaped injury while his father suffered minor shrapnel wounds to his legs.

Martin Richard's father, Bill Richard, released a statement on Tuesday thanking those who have been keeping his family in their thoughts and prayers and asked that their support continue.

'We thank our family and friends, those we know and those we have never met, for their thoughts and prayers,' he said. 'I ask that you continue to pray for my family as we remember Martin. We also ask for your patience and for privacy as we work to simultaneously grieve and recover. Thank you.'

More gatherers were also seen packing the Arlington Street Church for a candle light service before flooding into the Boston Public Garden. Their candles encircling a pool of water collectively shimmered gold before them.

Earlier in the day at Boston Common, 
hundreds of others attended a similar vigil titled 'Peace, Here and 
Everywhere' drawing out signs by participants that read 'Boston, you're 
our home.'

Others were seen quietly weeping in the arms of friends.

'I think it’s kind of beautiful,' Alicia Carroll, an Emerson College freshman attending the Tuesday night vigil told the Boston Globe.

'It reminds me of the patriotic feel of the inauguration. It’s nice to see so many people that care,' she said.

Participants sang songs including 
'Amazing Grace' and 'The Star-Spangled Banner.' With the help of an 
Emerson College acapella group, some sang the Beatles' 'Let It Be.'

Providing
added safety relief and protection on Thursday, a heavy military 
presence was seen on the Common with dozens of National Guard troops.

Among those attending the Boston Common vigil was Northeastern University student Scott Turner who hugged friends, wept and prayed.

He said the people of Boston would not be afraid and would respond by showing peace and supporting one another.

On Friday members of Boston College’s The Last 5 plan to organize an event allowing people to symbolically finish the marathon.

On Tuesday, thoughts and support for 
Boston were additionally seen and heard in New York's Yankee stadium as 
thousands listened and chanted along with Neal Diamond's Sweet Caroline 
as it played during the third inning 
of the Yankee's game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.

As a Red Sox staple, the song has been played at every Boston home game since 2002.

Even with the Red Sox's absence, the stadium was heard singing along.

The stadium also displayed an orange,
blue and white banner expressing their support for the city while 
reading: New York Stands with Boston.

Pope Francis has expressed his 'sympathy and closeness in prayer' to the city of Boston, saying he is 'deeply grieved by the news of the loss of life and grave injuries.'

Francis' message was sent in a telegram to Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley on Tuesday, a friend from his time as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Francis called on Bostonians to 'be united in a resolve not to be overcome by evil but to combat evil with good.'

He also implored the people to work together 'to build an ever more just, free and secure society for generations yet to come.'

'In the aftermath of this senseless tragedy, His Holiness invokes God’s peace upon the dead, his consolation upon the suffering and his strength upon all those engaged in the continuing work of relief and response,' the message released by the Vatican reads.
