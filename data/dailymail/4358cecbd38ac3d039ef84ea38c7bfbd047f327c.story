Rory McIlroy went from flirting with a third consecutive missed cut to a place inside the top 10 in the BMW PGA Championship on Friday.

With a swirling wind and intermittent rain making conditions difficult for the early starters, McIlroy covered the front nine of his second round at Wentworth in three over par.

That left McIlroy one under for the tournament with the halfway cut projected at that point to fall at level par, but just as he did in the recent Players Championship at Sawgrass, McIlroy rallied strongly on the back nine.

Cheer up, Rory: The Northern Irishman made three birdies in the last four holes to end on one-under par

An eagle on the 12th for the second 
day running was followed by a bogey on the 13th, but birdies on the 
15th, 16th and 18th gave McIlroy a 71 and halfway total of five under 
par.

And with overnight leader Thomas Bjorn starting his round with a bogey on the first, that was within four shots of the lead.

'I
 did not start off particularly well and made a mess of the seventh, but
 came back well and hit some quality shots on the back nine,' said 
McIlroy, who thinned a bunker shot on the seventh to run up a 
double-bogey six on a hole he eagled on Thursday.

'Anything under par this morning was a decent score and to birdie three of the last four holes is pretty pleasing.'

Yellow peril: Caroline Wozniacki takes to the practice court on Friday ahead of next week's French Open

McIlroy
 announced on Wednesday that he had called off his planned November 
wedding to former world No 1 tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, even 
though the invitations had just been sent out.

The
 25-year-old admitted he would therefore find it very difficult to 
concentrate on his golf in the European Tour's flagship event, but 
managed an opening 68 and felt slightly better on Friday.

'I
 was apprehensive going out yesterday, I honestly didn't know what to 
expect and it was good I had the quick turnaround to get back on the 
golf course.

'I have 
exceeded my expectations so far. Once you get inside the ropes you are 
concentrating on your golf and it's almost a nice four or five-hour 
release to concentrate on the job at hand.'

Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello had set the clubhouse target on six under 
after a round of 73, with Sweden's Jonas Blixt - joint second in the 
Masters last month - alongside McIlroy on five under following a 71.
