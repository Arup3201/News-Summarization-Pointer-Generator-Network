Jailed: Tara Sharrock, 23, was sentenced to two years in prison for setting fire to her own home with her three-year-old daughter inside

A mother who calls herself 'Tarty Tara' has been jailed for two years after setting fire to her own home with her three-year-old daughter inside following a drunken row with her boyfriend.

Tara Sharrock, 23, who had been drinking wine and smoking cannabis on the night of the blaze, set light to a sofa  - filling the house with toxic fumes as her child slept in her bed.

When her partner Danny Fisher and two police officers rescued Sharrock and her child from the house, she falsely blamed him for starting the fire screaming: 'You have done this, you b*****d. You have torched my f*****g house.'

The blaze left the rented terraced property with severe heat and smoke damage  - but miraculously no one was injured.

In the run up to the fire, the mother, from Burnley, Lancashire, had been in a drink-fuelled rage following an argument with her boyfriend - in which she claims he threw her 'right through a window'.

The pair had earlier been involved in a row outside a florists near their home - which resulted in the store's window being smashed. 

At Burnley Crown Court, Sharrock, who calls herself 'Tarty Tara - a fully time mummy' on Facebook, admitted arson and being reckless as to whether life was endangered. Her daughter is now in care.

Prosecutor Lisa Worsley told the hearing the incident occurred on September 2 last year after two police officers on patrol were flagged down by Mr Fisher, who told them a window had been broken at a florists after Sharrock tried to punch him.

One officer remained with Mr Fisher while the other went to check on the welfare of Sharrock. 

At first she refused to let him in, but eventually unbolted the door allowing him entry. 

Sat on a sofa in  room at the back of the house, Sharrock, who was smoking, told the officer she was 'f*****g sick' of Mr Fisher who she said had just thrown her 'right through a window'.

Miss Worsley said: 'The officer noted Sharrock smelled strongly of alcohol, her eyes were glazed and he thought she was very drunk. He also saw Sharrock had some blood on her chin and a minor cut on her right arm. 

'The officer told her to wipe the blood off so she wouldn't frighten her three-year-old daughter, who was in bed upstairs.

'The officer left to return to his colleague who had stayed with Mr Fisher minutes away and arrangements were being made to board up the window.' 

Miss Worsley said that about five minutes later, an officer heard a female voice coming from Sharrock's home shouting 'b*****d'.

She continued: 'He went to the street, found no sign of Sharrock and for about 15 minutes, he periodically went back to the street to see if there were any problems. 

'At about 11pm, he heard an alarm going off and the sound seemed to be coming from Sharrock's home.

'He went up a side alley by the house and saw black smoke coming from it and heard banging from an upstairs window with Sharrock shouting "Help, my f*****g house is on fire".'

The prosecutor said the officer tried to get in and failed but was helped by his colleague and Mr Fisher who led Sharrock and her daughter to safety. 

False accusation: When her partner Danny Fisher and two police officer rescued Sharrock and her child from the house, she falsely blamed him for starting the fire screaming: 'You have done this, you b*****d'

An officer noted that the flames were coming from the rear room where the Sharrock had - but she began screaming at Mr Fisher: 'You have done this you b*****d. You have torched my f*****g house.'

Miss Worsley continued: 'The officers explained that Mr Fisher had been with them and there was no chance he had set the house on fire.'

Sharrock was arrested and taken to the police station and an expert later found the point of origin of the fire was a section of a corner sofa in the lounge.

The prosecutor said: 'He noted this sofa contained a safety label saying it was resistant to cigarette ignition.' 

The blaze released a large volume of toxic fumes, caused severe heat and smoke damage and the heat build-up had made double glazed window units crack. The expert conduced there had been deliberate ignition with a naked flame.

Sharrock was not insured for deliberate damage and the cost of repairs to the property was £10,000. There was also a £1,000 loss of rent.

Mr Jeremy Coleman, defending Sharrock, said a care order had been made in respect of the child, but her daughter might be returned to her after her release. 

Mr Coleman said: 'This was very much out of character for her. No accelerants were used to start the fire. One way or another she was thrown through a glass window shortly before this incident.'

Mr Coleman said his client had been getting hold of the child when someone gained access to her house and pulled her out. 

He added: 'The child was already in her arms.' 

The lawyer said Sharrock had 'had a difficult childhood' and had been in foster care - while also having a background of alcohol and cannabis abuse.

He continued: 'Whilst being in custody is a controlled environment, it's to her credit that she has made steps to address these problems in constructive manner. It's more as a result of this incident taking place and being remanded in custody.'

Condemned act: Jailing her at Burnley Crown Court (above), the judge said: 'You set fire to your house. It could have resulted in the death not only of your daughter, but you and other people along that terrace'

But passing sentence the judge Mr Recorder Michael Blakey said: 'This was a deliberate ignition with a naked flame.This offence is a serious offence, It's a terrace set of houses, it's 11 o'clock at night. 

'You set fire to your house. You had your child with you at the time. It could have resulted in the death not only of your daughter, but you and other people along that terrace.'

'I accept this was a spur of the moment thing, something to do, perhaps, with the fact you had had a fight with your boyfriend and you went back in a temper and did what you did. It wasn't at all a planned attack.'
