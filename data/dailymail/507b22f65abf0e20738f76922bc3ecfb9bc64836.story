Quit: NHS boss Mike Farrar has decided to leave his job weeks before an inquiry that will look at his role in a baby deaths scandal

A senior Health Service boss has resigned ahead of a major inquiry into the needless deaths of mothers and babies.

Mike Farrar will stand down at the end of this month as the £200,000-a-year head of the NHS Confederation.

He is expected to face criticism during the inquiry starting next month into poor care at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay in Cumbria.

Two mothers and 14 babies are feared to have died from 2002 to 2012 while another nine suffered brain damage.

Yesterday grieving families accused Mr Farrar of ‘coincidentally’ leaving before the truth about the scandal comes to light.

James Titcombe, whose son Joshua died at the maternity unit in 2008 at only nine days old, said: ‘He’s stepping down without accepting any responsibility.

‘It’s hard to believe it’s a coincidence he is leaving now.’

Liza Brady’s son Alex also died there in 2008. ‘It’s absolutely  ridiculous.

It’s just too much of a coincidence that he is stepping down before the investigation goes ahead,’ she said.

Mr Farrar, previously head of the regional health body supervising the hospital, is accused of failing to take action. Mrs Brady, 28, added: ‘He was chief executive of the strategic health authority when Morecambe Bay was at its worst.

‘These failed NHS bosses are like a group of second-hand car salesmen. They form their own group helping each other out.

‘The truth about Morecambe Bay will come out and hopefully the NHS will be able to move forward.’

Mr Farrar leaves the confederation, which represents NHS managers, on a £1million taxpayer-funded pension pot paying-out £65,000 a year when he retires.

The 53-year-old  plans to set up a consultancy which will almost  certainly see him earn more NHS money by advising hospitals and health trusts how to improve care.

Today ministers are set to announce 
further details about the inquiry which is expected to last several 
months. These include the specific failings to be examined, who will be 
called to give evidence and where it will take place.

In
a statement announcing his departure, Mr Farrar failed to make any 
reference to the scandal or the timing of his resignation. Instead, he 
told of his ‘enormous privilege’ to have worked in the NHS for more than
two decades.

He added: ‘The
real sense of career satisfaction is to have been able to shape and see
real improvements in patient care, delivered according to need and 
never ability to pay.’

Mr 
Farrar is accused of repeatedly ignoring the concerns of grieving 
families when chief executive of the North West Strategic Health 
Authority from 2007 to 2011. A number of reports were commissioned into 
possible failings but the findings were never made public.

In
2010, Mr Farrar is reported to have reassured the Care Quality 
Commission watchdog that there was no need to launch an investigation 
into the unit.

This month, 
the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman will publish a separate 
report into the deaths of three babies at the unit which is also 
expected to  criticise Mr Farrar.

Professor John Ashton, former director of public health in  Cumbria, said: ‘He’s gone before the true facts come to light.

‘There needs to be a lot of questions about these chief executives who just move around the system. It is a revolving door.’

Mr
Farrar already has experience setting up consultancy firms. Last year 
he launched Unique Health Solutions, which has made  thousands of pounds
advising hospitals and health trusts.

He insisted, however, that he has not personally taken any money from the firm in wages or shares.Mr Farrar is also in a long-term relationship with one of the most powerful women in the Health Service.

His partner Rosamond Roughton, 44, is director of ‘commissioning development’ at NHS England.
