Indonesian police made a shocking discovery during a murder investigation at a luxury villa when they stumbled over an illegal private zoo.

Officers had been called to the home in the Sukaraia district of Bogar, in west Java, after a security guard confessed to a colleague that he had cut a young woman's throat after she spurred his advances and buried her body in the grounds.

Instead, they found the zoo containing an endangered Sumatran tiger, several types of monkeys and a liger - a lion-tiger crossbreed.

Liger, liger: The investigation into an alleged murder at a luxury villa in Indonesia saw officers stumble upon an illegal zoo housing a liger - a half lion/half tiger

The bizarre set of circumstances were still being investigated last night as police in Indonesia searched for the owner of the villa where the young murder victim is believed to have been living, possibly as an employee.

Detectives went to the villa, after one of the security guards, named as 31-year-old Slamet Pujiharto, confessed to another guard that he had murdered the woman, known only as Eneng, 28, because she had resisted his sexual advances.

After his arrest, Pujiharto was reported by the Jakarta Globe as confessing: ‘I asked her to have sex with me and she refused.

‘When I forced her, she scraped my face, which upset me. So I ran and took a knife and then slashed her throat with it four times.’

The guard, who said his role at the zoo was to also feed the animals, said that after the murder he had buried the woman’s body in the villa grounds.

It is believed that the murder victim and the guard were both employed at the villa which housed several peacocks as well as the rare predators and monkeys

His confession led to police raiding the property - and they were astonished to find animals there that most officers had never seen in their lives.

They included a critically-endangered Sumatran tiger, a Java gibbon, a langur monkey, a dusky leaf monkey, two siamang apes three Java peacocks - and the liger.

Now police are hunting for the owner, who was not at the villa when detectives arrived. But he, or she, is expected to be charged with keeping an illegal zoo.

‘Sancturaries that get permits to breed wild animals are conservation institutions like registered zoos, safari parks or breeding centres,’ an official of the Bogar Natural Resources Conservation Centre, told the Jakarta Globe.

The major concern was for the Sumatran tiger, whose species is critically endangered with only an estimated 400 to 500 existing in the wild.

But vets said the villa’s Sumatran tiger was ‘healthy enough,’ and would be moved to other zoos with the rest of the animals - all except the liger.

‘The presence of a new animal is not due to a natural cause and it exists because of human intervention,’ said the official. ‘There are no regulations on it, so we are suggesting that the liger be terminated.’

His comments have outraged animal lovers throughout Indonesia.

‘Is there no zoological garden which could care for this liger instead of terminating it?’ asked one writer.

‘Don’t kill the liger - it’s innocent,’ said another.

Yet another writer said the suggestion that the liger would be put down was ‘a weird attitude for a conservationist. The “go” solution is to kill it?…If anything, take the liger and put it in a zoo.’
