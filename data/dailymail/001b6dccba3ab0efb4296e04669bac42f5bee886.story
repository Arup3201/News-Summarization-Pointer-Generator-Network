A formerly conjoined twin who was separated from his brother at just eight-weeks-old has died aged two.

Jacob Spates died last week according to Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis, although the cause of his death is unclear.

Doctors had been optimistic about the twins' chances after separation.

The moment Jacob and Joshua see each other for the first time at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Memphis, where they were born two years ago

Jacob and his brother Joshua were joined at the rear of the pelvis and gastrointestinal tract when they were born January 24, 2011 via cesarean section at the Regional Medical Center.

They were attached at the pelvis and lower spine, but had separate hearts, heads and limbs.

At eight-weeks-old they had to be separated because of the severity of Jacob's heart condition and endured a 13-hour operation.

But the boys recovered at different rates.

Jacob remained in intensive care and 
needed few more operations, while Joshua recovered quicker and was given
 the all-clear to go home with the twin's mother Adrienne Spates.

In
 2011 Dr Max Langham, one of the hospital's surgeons told TODAY: 'Joshua's doing great, and hopefully 
he'll be up and going and have a pretty normal lifespan.

He said that while Jacob has 
more serious heart problems 'our cardiology team has very high hopes his
 treatment… will be successful'.

'If they had not been separated, sometime in the next year or two, they probably would have passed,' Dr Langham said.

Ms
 Spates, a single mother who has two other children, cried when her sons
 saw each other for the first time: 'I'm glad that everyone gets to see 
my baby and view them as separate people because they are and they have 
their own personalities,' she said.

Battling: A team of surgeons at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Memphis worked for 13 hours to separate the babies  and keep them alive

Relief: Joshua and Jocob's mother Adrienne was overwhelmed that all went to plan at hospital

In April 2012 the twins were placed in the custody of the Department of Child Services following the DUI arrest of their mother.

It was unclear whether the children were still in DCS custody when Jacob died.

Just two dozen conjoined twins have ever been successfully separated anywhere in the world.

The
 condition is extremely rare, only about one in every 200,000 live 
births is a set of conjoined twins and about 15 per cent of these are 
joined in a similar way to Joshua and Jacob.

Fewer than a third of conjoined twins survive more than one day after birth.

Joshua and Jacob are one of only six such cases in Memphis history.

Doctors at the hospital said practice was the key to separating the twins successfully.

This had included the anaesthesia team sewing together two Cabbage Patch dolls to practise flipping them without tangling the various lines that would be attached during surgery.

Last week a formerly conjoined twin who was surgically separated from her sister in April died in Virginia.

A'zhari Jones died just days after celebrating her first birthday with her twin sister A'zhiah.

It is as yet unknown whether the death of A'zhari Jones was caused by complications from the separation surgery.
