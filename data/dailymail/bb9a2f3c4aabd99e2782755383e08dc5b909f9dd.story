A National Rifle Association television ad targeting Democratic West Virginian Senator Joe Manchin for his work with President Barack and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to draft new gun control legislation uses a shaded photo of the African-American president that makes him appear darker and, according to some critics - like MSNBC's Joe Scarborough - more sinister.

In the ad, Bloomberg's face appears to be shaded, as well, but much less dramatically than the president's

Obama's darker appearance in the ad is being compared to a controversial 1994 Time magazine cover that shows a shaded image of former Buffalo Bills running back O.J. Simpson - who, at the time, was on trial for the brutal murders of his ex-wife and another man - that makes his skin seem much darker than it actually is.

Made in the shade: the NRA shaded this photo of President Barack Obama to make him appear darker than he actually is

Notice anything different?

The Time magazine cover came at a time when racial tensions across the U.S. began heating up as a result of the Simpson trial, which divided the country along racial lines for a variety of reasons.

Specifically, those skeptical about the state's case against Simpson charged that the lead investigator on the case, former Los Angeles Police Department Detective Mark Fuhrman, was racist and had planted evidence to frame the Heisman trophy winner.

Critics contend that the Time cover was racist, and was designed to make Simpson look more sinister, and - as an African-American on trial for murder - guilty. Others claimed that the altered image was designed to make it appear more dramatic in an effort to sell more copies of the magazine.

Sinister: Pundits are comparing the NRA's ad with this controversial Time magazine cover, where O.J. Simpson's skin is shaded to make him appear darker

James Gaines, the managing editor of the magazine when the now-infamous cover was published, later posted an explanation online.

'It seems to me you could argue that it's racist to say that blacker is more sinister, but be that as it may: To the extent that this caused offense to anyone, I obviously regret it,' Gaines said in his message.

The NRA did not respond to Mail Online's request for comment, nor has it responded to any of the criticism that the ad is racist.

The NRA dropped more than $100,000 on the ad, which will start airing in West Virginia in two weeks.

The ad quotes one of Manchin's videos from his 2010 Senate campaign, in which he says 'As your senator, I'll protect your second amendment rights.'

A voiceover in the ad then says, 'That was Joe Manchin's commitment. But now, Manchin is working with President Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Concerned? You should be. Tell Sen. Manchin to honor his commitment to the Second Amendment and reject the Obama-Bloomberg gun control agenda.'

Manchin - who has previously received an 'A' rating from the NRA - recently sponsored a bill with Republican Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey that would have expanded background checks on gun buyers to include sales at gun shows and over the Internet.

The bill failed to get the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster, but Manchin recently said that he hopes the Senate would again consider expanding background checks - which is what put him the cross-hairs of the nation's most powerful gun lobby.
