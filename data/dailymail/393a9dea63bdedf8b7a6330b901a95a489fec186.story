A crazed customer launched a 'wolf-like' attack on a chip shop owner, biting and scratching him because he refused to refund her £1.35 for 'disgusting' potato scallops.

Paulos Iasonides, 67, was left needing hospital treatment after Hayley Jones, 33, dug her teeth into his arm for around 40 seconds while he tried to shake her off.

During the struggle, Jones drew blood by scratching Mr Iasonides' ear with her nails and also kicked him.

She also tried to force her way behind
 the counter towards the till but he managed to block her - fearing she 
might get a knife to stab him.

The victim's wife Hariklitsa Iasonides,
 59, who was running a hairdressers upstairs, heard screaming and 
shouting and came downstairs to help her husband restrain Jones and 
eject her from the shop.

When police arrived at Reedley chip shop in Brierfield, Lancashire, they found Jones pacing up and down outside the shop screaming and shouting at her victim.

The Cypriot-born father-of-four revealed he has been left so disturbed by the attack that he is now suffering from panic attacks and waking up in the middle of the night screaming.

Mr Iasonides, who is now scarred for life, later told police: 'She was like a mad person. She was like a wolf.'

At Burnley Crown Court, Jones was handed a 44-week jail sentence suspended for two years, with two years' supervision.

Jones had bought a scallop from Paulos Iasonides' Reedley Chippy in Lancashire, but she returned three or four minutes later and demanded her money back, claiming the food was 'disgusting'

She was convicted by a jury of occasioning actual bodily harm at an earlier hearing.

He said: 'I cannot believe the behaviour of that woman on that day - I've never had any trouble like that before.

'She
 was like a crazy woman, acting like a wild animal. When someone comes 
in and they are big, I panic because I don't know what's going to 
happen. I could get a stick and defend myself but I know I would be in 
trouble.

'I have lost a lot 
of business going to hospital and court because of what this woman did. 
At night time sometimes I wake up screaming and my wife doesn't know 
what's the matter.

'I'm suffering from these panic attacks. I
 used to stay open until half ten but now at half nine I lock up and go 
because I get scared.'

The court heard the incident occurred on April 12 at 2pm whilst Mr Iasonides was serving lunchtime customers.

Jones who had been drinking brandy walked in and began arguing with Mr Iasonides about his prices before ordering a tea cake and three potato scallops.

She paid £1.35 and went outside but returned several minutes later, shouted abuse at Mr Iasonides him and demanded her money back.

He added: 'She was shouting and screaming saying the food was disgusting and she wanted her money back. A lad who was in the shop saw her being nasty and he ran away because he was so scared.

'To get rid of her because I could tell she was nasty and drunk I got her arm and said "go" but she wouldn't go and she wanted her money. She saw where the till was and tried to come through the counter into the back. My wife heard the noise from upstairs and came down and we both tried to push her away.

The court heard Jones had previous convictions for common assault from 1998 and 2002 and possessing an offensive weapon in 2003

'She was on her own but she was big and strong like a wild wolf. She was saying "I want my money". We tried to push her out and she put her hands on the wall and wouldn't go.

'Somehow we managed to push her away and she bit me as I was standing at the door. I still have a scar. She also scratched me behind the ear and she kicked my leg. Eventually we pushed her outside and I stood in the door so she couldn't get in.

'She was walking up and down the street shouting and swearing until the police came. Two vans came and they took her and saw she was drunk and my wife said I was bleeding and that's when we find out she'd scratched me too.'

Mr Iasonides went to hospital to get treatment for his wounds and had to undergo blood tests to see if he had suffered any infections as a result of the bite wound. He has since been prescribed tablets for the stress.

The hearing was told Jones had convictions for common assault from 1998 and 2002 and possessing an offensive weapon in 2003.

Sentencing, Judge Robert Altham told her: 'Mr Mr Iasonides was carrying out his lawful trade yet you, in the middle of the afternoon were drunk. You took exception to him, for no good reason, and you engaged in a scuffle with him.

'You tried to get behind the counter, which, with hot oils and knives, and when you were out of control. It's a really unpleasant injury because it's painful and carries with it an anxiety about infection.

'He describes how he has ongoing effects and some nights he wakes from sleep because he is traumatised by it.

'I do find that you biting is tantamount to the use of a weapon. People who work on their own in establishments such as that are vulnerable to attack from people like you who are out of control.'
