Travelling support

Monaco may only have 37,000 residents but they still managed to take up their allocation of 3,000 away tickets at Arsenal, all of whom were bedecked in either red or white and organised into the correct rows in order to represent the Monaco national flag. As is traditional, they made more noise than the Emirates home crowd.

Bare bones

Monaco had already had to cut their cloth in the summer, loaning Radamel Falcao and selling James Rodriguez, in a bid to comply with UEFA’s financial fair play restrictions and to take account of a £35m payment they had to make to the French league. So, having their entire back four out injured on Wednesday as well as captain Jeremy Toulalan suspended, they really were down to the ‘bare bones’ by Monte Carlo standards.

No part-time prince 

His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco, the ruler of the principality, who was in London for the game is another who was part of the club when Wenger was there. The Prince is no part-time glory hunter, however. He took in Swansea-West Ham on a recent visit to Wales for Six Nations rugby, demonstrating an admirable fan-like devotion for sneaking an extra match in to a trip.

Francis' new deal 

Franics Coquelin’s new four-year deal with the club should be announced soon. The Frenchman was concerned he wasn’t in Wenger’s mind as a first-team player - but starting such an important tie as this one was another demonstartion of the manager’s faith. Even Mikel Arteta’s return from injury won’t derail his progress with the club viewing Coquelin as their key holding midfield.

Don't forget the youngsters 

It’s been an overlooked fact in the focus on the glamorous transfers at Monaco, which started with Mark Hateley and Glenn Hoddle, but Monaco have run one of the great youth programmes in French football. Thierry Henry, Emmanuel Petit, Lilian Thuram from the 1998 World Cup winning team came through their ranks and Wednesday's starting eleven featured Almamy Toure and Anthony Martial, both graduates from the youth team.

Familiar face for Wenger  

There aren’t many still left at Monaco associated with Arsene Wenger’s time at the club. But Jean Petit, who was Wenger’s assistant, is still a coach at the club and Wenger revealed that they still meet up whenever the Arsenal manager is back in town to have lunch and ‘talk about the good old times.’
