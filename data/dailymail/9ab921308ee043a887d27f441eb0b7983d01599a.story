Authorities have confirmed a body that washed up on a Florida beach has been identified as a missing cruise ship worker.

Clearwater Police said in a news release that the body of 27-year-old Cliford B. Minej was found Friday morning.

His body was found in the 1500 block of Gulf Boulevard on Sand Key around 7:15 a.m buy a person walking along the beach.

Minej, from Thane in India, had worked on a Holland America Line cruise ship that came to port in Tampa on Sunday.

Washed ashore: The body was found on Clearwater Beach on Friday morning by a walker. Police say it was identified as Holland America Line cruise ship worker Clifford B. Minej, of India, who went missing Sunday

Police believe Minej jumped or fell off the ship near Egmont Key on Sunday before the ship ported, and the Coast Guard had been searching Tampa Bay-area waters.

Clearwater is about 20 miles away.

The Pinellas County Medical Examiner's Office has ruled the death accidental.

The ship, called Ryndam, was at the end of a 14-day Caribbean cruise. 

Cruise operator, Holland America Line, released a statement about the incident to The Tampa Bay Times.

'We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our crew members and our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this difficult time,' the statement said.
