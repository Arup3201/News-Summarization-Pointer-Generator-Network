An outspoken Australian Islamist has been banned from appearing at a Sydney University event on the anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks.

Uthman Badar - the spokesperson for the Australian-based Islamsit group Hizb ut-Tahrir - was due to speak at the University of Sydney on Thursday but in an 11th hour decision has been banned from appearing. 

Vice Chancellor Michael Spence cancelled the non-registered Q&A event declaring he was unaware that a Muslim student's association group had organised it.

Uthman Badar, the media spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir, was to front an open Q&A event at Sydney University before it was cancelled

Mr Badar was advertised to appear at the Islamic Awareness Week, run by the Sydney University Muslim Students' Association, The Daily Telegraph reported.

In a Facebook post he said he would be appearing as a member of an open 'QnA panel, along with Shaykh Wesam Charkawi, entitled 'Grill a Muslim' tomorrow.'

The two-hour event was billed as an opportunity for people to 'ask anything and everything.'

Thursday is the 13th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks

A spokeswoman for Sydney University said the it was not registered and security did not know about it.

The ban comes on the same day Mr Badar made damming comments regarding Australia's hard-line stance on terrorism threats.

He said that it if an attack 'does occur on Australian soil' the Government would be to blame because of its 'persisent unjust targeting of muslims.'

The Australian reported that the Government is preparing to ramp up its terror security alert from medium to high for the first time, to ward off the threat of terror attacks.

'If an attack does occur on Australian soil...government policy of the last decade will be responsible for its persistent agression and imposition on the Muslim world and persistent unjust targeting of Muslims locally.'

Mr Badar said the government can not 'persistently provoke and then expect to control the reaction.'

Mr Badar's ban from Sydney University comes two months after he was dropped from the Festival of Dangerous Ideas event at the Sydney Opera House in August.

Mr Badar was the subject of public backlash earlier this year when he was scheduled to give a talk entitled 'Honour Killings are Morally Justified' at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas.

He and the festival made it clear they don't support honour killings.

In a statement on its Facebook The Opera House said at the time: 'The Festival of Dangerous Ideas is intended to be a provocation to thought and discussion, rather than simply a provocation'.

'It is always a matter of balance and judgement, and in this case a line has been crossed... It is clear from the public reaction that the title has given the wrong impression of what Mr Badar intended to discuss.

'Neither Mr Badar, (festival organisers) the St James Ethics Centre, nor Sydney Opera House in any way advocates honour killings or condones any form of violence against women.'

Mr Badar's defence came after it  revealed the Prime Minister's plan to stop extremists fighting in the Middle East from returning to Australia was in legal limbo.

Mr Badar said the backlash against his slated Festival of Dangerous Ideas talk said more about bigotry in Australia than it did about him.
