It is an over-the-top and extravagant house that would not look out of place at a theme park.

But for Teresa and husband Giuseppe 'Joe' Giudice, their dream home is quickly turning into a nightmare as the pair face charges of financial fraud over the property.

In newly released stills from theÂ Bravo show The Real Housewives of New Jersey, Teresa's lavish home has been revealed in all its opulent glory.

Gaudy: This marble-floor hallway and double staircase with have cost the Giudice family a pretty penny

Teresa is seen posing in her daughter Audriana's room which features an animated self-portrait titled 'Mama Teresa'.

The gaudy dining room includes a giant low-hung chandelier which certainly wouldn't have come cheap.

But perhaps the most costly sight of all is the hallways in the property which features marble flooring and a double staircase.

Yesterday it was revealed that Teresa and her husband Joe had been released on a combined $1million bail after making initial court appearances Tuesday on federal fraud charges.

Mother-of-four Teresa broke her silence on her official Twitter account on Wednesday to talk about the case.

'Thank you all so so much for your love and support. It means the world to me and my family,' adding: 'I wish I could hug you all right now.'

The couple have been ordered to surrender their passports and to confine their travels to New Jersey and New York. Joe Giudice could be deported to Italy if convicted because he is not a U.S. citizen.

Teresa, 41, and her 43-year-old husband had toned down their usual flamboyant look to wear differing shades of slate suit, the reality TV queen even had her famous hair slicked back into a sensible ponytail as she walked into Martin Luther King Jr. courthouse in Newark, New Jersey.

The couple were charged in a 39-count indictment Monday with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, making false statements on loan applications and bankruptcy fraud.

They are accused of exaggerating their income while applying for loans before their TV show debuted in 2009, then hiding their fortunes in a bankruptcy filing after their first season aired.

Authorities allege the couple submitted fraudulent mortgage and other loan applications from 2001 to 2008, a year before their show debuted on Bravo. Prosecutors said the couple submitted fake W-2s, tax returns and bank account information to lenders.

In a statement, Teresa said she supports her husband and wants to resolve the charges as soon as possible.

'I am committed to my family and intend to maintain our lives in the best way possible, which includes continuing my career,' she said.

In their 2009 bankruptcy filing, the couple said they were $11 million in debt. They stated their monthly take-home pay was $16,583, but $10,000 was from 'monthly assistance from family members' and Bravo income.

It also said they owed $2.2 million in mortgages, $13,000 to Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom and nearly $12,000 to a fertility clinic.

The most serious charges the couple face, bank fraud and loan application fraud, carry a maximum potential penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.

If convicted, they could face a maximum sentence of more 50 years in prison.
