They fell in love in Sydney, had two daughters and when things turned sour their babies went back to family in China. Last weekend, the couple who called each other 'Carlos and Carrie' were on their way to join them.

The photos and playful messages posted on social media by Gu Naijun and Li Yuan before they boarded Flight MH 370 to be reunited with their small daughters are heartwarming.

Fleeing a dream gone wrong in Australia, where Ms Gu and Mr Li had to sell up after their business went into liquidation, the couple teased each other with adoring remarks and photos of their little 'princesses'.Â

Missing: Sydney mother Gu Naijun used her microblogging site to post photos of her self and her two young daughters to husband Li Yuan when he was away on business in China, with teasing messages, but when their dream life in Australia went wrong their two little girls went back to China and were with relatives waiting for their parents to join them when Flight MH 370 vanished

The couple posted what is likely to to be their last conversation in words and pictures about their children on Ms Gu's microblogging account on Weibo, one of China's most popular social media sites, reports the Sydney Morning Herald.

Ms Gu can been seen posing with her little girls, a baby and a toddler, in a series of happy family shots, going to lunch, at the swimming pool, dressing up in frilly clothes.

Ms Gu, 31, appeared to be using the microblog to share her daughters' day with husband, Li Yuan, 32, who travelled to China for his job as a partner in startup software firm, Beijing Landysoft Technology.

'Dad, I'm playing on the slide now,' reads the caption on a photograph taken at a playground.

'You'll be rolling all over the floor,' was the reply.

Relatives of Gu Naijun and Li Yuan were reportedly minding their grandaughters in China, and like the families of all 239 passangers on the missing flight are now waiting anxiously for news.

Mr Li was born in Beijing and Ms Gu in Shanghai.

Carlos and Carrie, the anglicised names chosen by the couple, met as university students in Sydney, fell in love and married.

Little princesses: The Chinese born Sydney couple who called themselves 'Carlos and Carrie' posted adoring words and photos (above) on social media site Weibo of their two little girls they were returning to China to see after their Asutarlia dream went wrong and they were forced to sell up

The couple bought a home in the southern Sydney suburb of Sylvania, and the Metro petrol station at nearby Miranda in 2007.

Ms Gu remained in touch with friends and family back in China. She gave birth to two daughters, and the couple worked hard.

But their financial situation appeared to turn bad following a terrible accident at the petrol station, in which a 24-year-old electrician, Peter Wahhab, was electrocuted after he fell from a ladder while installing an air conditioner.

The business was placed into liquidation by administrators, and the bank repossessed their home, forcing the couple to move into a smaller, rented apartment.

Meanwhile, Mr Li had branched out with the software business back in a new industrial park in China. At some point, their daughters went to stay with their Chinese relatives.

It is not clear whether the husband and wife were returning to live in China or visiting when they made their fateful trip.

The relatives of the 153 Chinese passengers on the flight have gathered at Beijing's Lido Hotel to wait out the investigation into the missing plane in rooms set up by authorities with television screens and regular news reports.
