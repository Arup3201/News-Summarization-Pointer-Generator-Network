Tourists in South Africa could not believe their eyes when Perdy - a 20ft giraffe - casually strolled through an animal sanctuary restaurant.

It was a shock to visitors at the Lion Park animal sanctuary in Johannesburg who after an initial shock then became hysterical with nervous laughter.

The giraffe stopped briefly and sniffed in the bins but had obviously already had its dinner as it did not stop for a bite to eat or drink. 

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Caught on camera: Perdy the giraffe looks straight at a tourist's camera as she visits the restaurant at the Lion Park animal sanctuary

Rummaging: Perdy stops and sniffs in the bin as she looks for food in the restaurant

Show is over: Perdy has had enough attention from onlookers for one day and starts to make her way home

The lucky tourists can be heard chatting about how nobody back home would believe their story. Fortunately though one smart visitor decided to video the whole incident - proving to friends and family back home that the story was no lie. 

'How can you explain this to someone,' a woman is heard asking a fellow onlooker on the video.

She added: 'It's not the same as saying, "oh the giraffe was in the restaurant.'

The Johannesburg Lion Park allows animals access to all areas and zebras are also often spotted around the grounds. 

Unimpressed: Perdy walks off into the night looking distinctly unimpressed with the menu at the animal park

Strolling: This is the moment Perdy casually walks across the bar at the Lion Park animal sanctuary in Johannesburg - causing gasps from tourists sitting nearby

Tower of strength: Perdy's true size and strength can be seen from this angle - an enormous animal

Disappearing into the night: The giraffe heads home after her short trip to the bar - no doubt she'll back again
