Make-up free: Former ballerina Darcey Bussell steps out in West London

As an ex-prima ballerina who now has a glamorous judging job on Strictly Come Dancing, the Darcey Bussell we know is poised, elegant and rarely has a hair out of place.

But the 44-year-old dancer seemed happy to show off a slightly scruffier look this week, wearing a rather mismatched ensemble during a family outing in West London.

She opted for a pair of loose-fitting tartan leggings, which she teamed with a wax overcoat and a long black tunic.

She chose to go make-up free for the oaccasion, even apparently neglecting to style her normally luscious mane of hair as she walked the streets in west London.

The mother of two, who recently starred in a high-profile Marks and Spencer’s advertising campaign, couldn’t have looked more different from her highly-poolished appearances on the BBC1 dance contest if she had tried.

It was in August this year that Miss Bussell starred in the Leading Ladies campaign for Marks and Spencer alongside Olympic medal winner Nicola Adams, artist Tracey Emin, novelist Monica Ali and actress Dame Helen Mirren.

The campaign was pitched as a celebration of successful women, highlighting their desire to remain fashionable as they mature.

Talking about her sense of style, Miss Bussell, who is widely recognised as Britain’s greatest ever ballet dancer, recently said: ‘Don’t get me wrong, when I dress for an evening out, I like to go the whole way.

‘I know some people worry they’re going to be overdressed, but when I go out I don’t care. It’s odd because I live on stage in costumes and yet I never want to dress down.

‘My grandmother used to wear these really high, elegant Charles Jourdan stilettos well into her 70s, and I thought she looked great, whatever her age. I know I’ll always make an effort, and to look as glamorous as my grandma would be my ideal.’

Miss Bussell started in ballet at the age of 13. By 17 she had joined the Royal Ballet Company and, by 20, she had become the youngest ever principal dancer the company had seen, receiving an OBE six years later in 1995.

She retired from dancing six years ago, and her final performance in Sir Kenneth MacMillan’s The Song Of The Earth at the Royal Opera House ended with an eight-minute standing ovation and a stage knee-deep in flowers.

Miss Bussell returned to the limelight in 2012 when she took over as a judge on Strictly Come Dancing from singer Alesha Dixon.

She is married to investment banker Angus Forbes, and the couple have daughters Phoebe, 12 and nine-year-old Zoe. She and her husband of 16 years, banker Angus Forbes, then moved the family to Australia, where Darcey has since written a successful series of children’s books.
