Work has recommenced on what is set to become America's largest family home.

The sprawling 90,000-square-foot property in Windermere, Florida, owned by  former beauty queen Jackie Siegel, 47, and her self-made billionaire husband, David, 78, was imagined six years ago.

But building work stopped on the property during the recession in 2009 after the couple ran out of funds.

The Siegels, who were the subject of 2012 fly-on-the-wall documentary Queen of Versailles, now hope to finally move into the vast mansion with their eight children after scraping together the $30million needed to complete it.

Back in the money: Former beauty queen Jackie Siegel, 47, and her self-made billionaire husband, David, 78, have restarted work on their   sprawling 90,000-square-foot property in Windermere, Florida

Mrs Siegel, who won the Miss Florida 
title in the 1990s,  told The New York Post that as a result of the delay they have had to make several minor adjustments to the floor plan - especially now that their children are older.

For example, instead of sandboxes and playrooms, they plan on creating 'man caves' and yoga studios.

The Siegels modeled their extravagant 30-bedroom home after France's 17th century Palace of Versailles and started laying foundations on a ten-acre plot of land in 2007.

Their lavish pad is nine times larger than other houses in the area and has a $20million mortgage, which is 100 times the size of the average mortgage in Central Florida, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Long-term project: The Siegels started building their mansion on a ten acre plot more than a decade ago

Artist's impression: When it is complete, the hall will feature two staircases and a massive central chandelier, hanging beneath a 30ft stained-glass dome

Unfinished: The 120ft-long Grand Hall will be the centrepiece of the mansion

However in 2009 they were forced to put their project on hold as their finances suffered a blow during the recession.

Instead of pouring his profits into buying construction materials Mr Siegel concentrated his efforts on protecting his 30-year-old time-share and real estate company Westgate Resorts.

'We're finishing it to actually finish it. But we do want to live in there'

Last July he even decided to put the property, which was only two-thirds complete, on the market for $65million so he could reinvest the money in his business.

But after it failed to sell the Siegels decided to keep hold of the building and surrounding land. This year work restarted and Mrs Siegel told Today in February: 'We're finishing it to actually finish it. But we do want to live in there.'

And she revealed to The New York Post that the family are once again enjoying their extravagant lifestyle.

Luxury feel: It was previously estimated that it would take two years to add the finishing touches to the property

'I never see a bill. My husband gives me credit cards and I think they’re like magic, they just keep working,' the buxom blonde explained.

As well as 30 bedrooms, the concrete home fronted with white marble from Italy, will have 23 bathrooms boasting spectacular views over Lake Butler, about 20 miles outside Orlando.

All
 23 full bathrooms will have full-sized hot tubs, and 160 triple-pane 
windows and Brazilian mahogany French-style doors promise plenty of 
light.

The hand-built windows for the house cost more than $2million and bespoke materials have been sourced from all over the world.

Hands full: Mrs Siegel is a mother to eight children and has an army of nannies to help her

On the entertainment front a roller rink,  children's theater, bowling alley, three swimming pools, a baseball field and two tennis courts will be installed.

And
 outside a large boat house, formal gardens, a one-story gatehouse and 
an underground garage with enough space for 20 cars will complete the 
palatial look.

There is also a His and Her office space with a 12ft two-sided aquarium.

The Siegels currently live in a 26,000-square-foot home in the exclusive Isleworth gated community, best known as the scene of Tiger Woods' 2009 car crash just before his divorce.

The entire family and their entourage of staff featured in Queen of Versailles, a film by Lauren Greenfield which grossed more than $2million and won numerous awards including the U.S. Directing Award at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival.

Upstairs: The upper level has the lion's share of the bedrooms, as well as the children's theater

Floorplan: The main level has offices, a media room, the Grand Hall, pool deck and outdoor summer kitchen

Downstairs: The lower level has a 20-car garage, skating rink, bowling alley, games arcade and indoor pool

Mrs Seigel previously said that she enjoyed her time in the spotlight and would like to launch a career in reality TV. However she admitted to the New York Post: 'I don’t have time to watch a lot of TV but I probably need to start educating myself on the "Housewives" and what’s out there.' 

While their yet-to-be-completed home is large, the original Versailles, outside Paris 
and completed by the Sun King, Louis XIV, in 1710, is much, much larger.

The 219,000-square-foot landmark boasts 2,300 rooms and 67 staircases. 
Building it also caused financial problems, nearly bankrupting France.

Bravo will revisit Queen of Versailles by airing the documentary April 29.
