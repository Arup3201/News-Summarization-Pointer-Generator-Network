Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has ruled out any prospect of selling Yaya Toure despite the midfielder's limited contribution this season and his petulant red card against CSKA Moscow on Wednesday.

Pellegrini has rallied around theIvory Coast midfielder whose indifferent form has coincided with the grief of losing a younger brother to cancer and being racially insulted on Twitter.

And the Chilean boss has cheekily suggested reports that Toure will leave City may emanate from clubs who would like to buy him.

Manuel Pellegrini says Yaya Toure will not be sold by Manchester City despite inconsistent displays this year

Pellegrini said Toure is considered a 'very important player' and the club has never thought of selling him

Pellegrini said: 'I think Yaya is a very important player, he scored a goal against CSKA and in the second half he made a mistake and got sent off.

'Never in my mind or anyone at the club have we thought about selling Yaya Toure.

'Maybe the stories come from other teams that want to see us weaker.'

Toure scored for City against CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday 

But the Ivorian midfielder later saw red as Man City slumped to a defeat that dents their European hopes

Manchester City are currently six points behind Chelsea in the Premier League title race

City travel to Queens Park Rangers on Saturday six points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea. But Pellegrini insists he can shut out the pressure.

'The only pressure I feel is from myself to win and play attacking football,' he said.

'I think we are defending very well, nobody has conceded less than us in the league except Southampton.

'At times last season, it was impossible to beat us because (David) Silva, (Samir) Nasri, Yaya and Fernandinho were all in a good moment. Now we have Silva injured and Nasri is just coming back.

'I think we will return to our natural way of playing soon. But I don't want to use any excuses.'
