True Lady: Margaret Thatcher was many things, including always well quiffed

It’s certainly not the kind of legacy many prime ministers can expect to have.

Since Baroness Thatcher’s death earlier this month, scores of women have been paying tribute to her in a rather unexpected way – by adopting her hairstyle.

One hairdresser, in Chelsea said he had been inundated by requests for ‘The Thatcher’, as the iconic style has become known.

Celebrity stylist Maximiliano Centini says his salon has been inundated with demands for the style and bookings are full.

‘I have not known anything like this for many years,’ said Mr Centini.

‘We have now done the style for over 
100 women, it is a surge. I experienced something similar when the 
Jennifer Aniston style became popular but that surge built slowly - this
 has come completely out of the blue.’

Thatcher’s famous hairstyle originated in Chalmer’s salon in Mayfair during the early 1970s.

The Iron Lady’s first modern look was adapted slightly as she aged but the cut never lost its unique power.

‘I decided to recreate the early look on one of my actress clients,’ reveals Mr Centini.

‘It blossomed from there. The cut 
looked striking on her, other models and actresses that she knows were 
soon calling asking for the ‘Thatcher’. At first I found it amusing but 
now the domino effect has become serious, the demand is too much to cope
 with.’

‘I immediately fell in love with the cut,’ said the actress.

‘It is the perfect mix of feminine 
style with a hint of masculine power. I think for a modern woman that is
 now an ideal balance. When my other model and actress friends saw it 
they were immediately intrigued. I have been turning a lot of heads.’

Margaret Thatcher’s powerful image - steely and professional, yet always feminine -  was a key part of her status.

However, few women replicated the look
 during her time in office. Now, in a time perhaps of greater equality, 
women have happily embraced the look.

The impact has now echoed into 
Hollywood. Sharon Stone caused a stir at the weekend when she arrived at
 the White House sporting a ‘power statement’ style.

Her famous blonde hair was swept 
tightly to her head, adopting the same lines as the ‘Thatcher’. Her look
 at the Obama hosted event made headlines across the world.

Italian-born Christina Bellucci, 37, a digital consultant, said she felt the look reflected a modern attitude.

‘This is a strong style and gives me authority,’ she said.

‘When I walk out the door I feel a few inches taller, it gives me power without sacrificing any of my femininity.’

‘We’ve done over seventy of the styles
 since the news broke of Margaret’s death,’ reveals Centini.

‘It is a 
steady flow at the moment. What I like is that women are using it to 
give their lives and general attitudes a boost, many of them tell me 
that they step out of the chair with more confidence.

It started with younger girls adopting
 the style - now they have started sending their mums in! What I find 
interesting is that every women will have a different image of Thatcher 
in their mind depending on their age.’

Achieving the look is initially a 
complicated process. ‘Margaret Thatcher paid a surprising amount of 
attention to her style,’ says Centini.

Holly Carpenter, a 32-year-old mum of 
two, said she appreciated the style’s practicality. ‘She was a busy 
lady, and so am I. Once the cut is done, the ‘Thatcher’ is quick and 
easy to knock into place and I can run out the door.’

Celebrity clients of the salon range 
from Sophie Dahl to the ‘Made in Chelsea’ stars; we may be seeing ‘The 
Thatcher’ on our screens soon.

‘I never reveal client details and I will
 not say who has expressed an interest,’ says Centini. ‘But, yes, I 
think it is safe to say that more star names are set to take this style 
back onto the world stage.’
