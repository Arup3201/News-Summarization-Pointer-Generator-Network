Maternity and paternity pay for new parents will be included in a new cap on welfare spending, David Cameron admitted yesterday.

The cost of the benefits, which are paid to mothers and fathers who take time off work to look after their children, is set to exceed £2.5billion a year within four years as more parents take them up.

The Prime Minister confirmed that they will be covered by a new, overall cap on most welfare spending –  forcing the Treasury into a pledge that it would not cut them in the next Parliament.

Rising: The cost of statutory maternity pay is expected to top £2.5billion by 2017-18, according to Treasury figures

David Cameron was accused of ‘picking 
on’ working families after revealing that maternity and paternity pay 
will not be protected from the limit on the total amount which can be 
spent on benefits.

The coalition has insisted the Government’s welfare squeeze must continue, and has challenged Labour to sign up to a new, permanent cap on most benefit spending before 2015.

However,
government sources conceded that it would be open to future governments
to limit the costs of parental leave pay as part of the requirement on 
them to keep overall benefit expenditure under control.

The cap means
that if part of the benefits bill begins to spiral, the Treasury would 
either have to cut it back or reduce other areas of welfare spending 
instead. The inclusion of maternity pay means it could, in  theory, be 
subject to further cuts.

Chancellor George Osborne announced a cap on total benefits spending would start from 2015 after the precise limit is set out in spring next year.

If the limit is breached ministers would have to explain it to Parliament and then allow MPs a vote.

The basic state pension, which is costing £83billion this year, will be excluded along with Jobseekers Allowance, with the remaining £100billion of welfare spending capped.

Admission: David Cameron said that all benefits had to be looked at to keep control of spending spending

It means that if parts of the benefits
bill suddenly increases – if there is a rise in unemployment, for 
example – then other areas of spending would need to be cut.

By including maternity pay spending in the cap, it could in theory be subject to cuts.

Government sources insisted that maternity pay would be 'one of the last things' which would be affected by cutbacks.

But
in last year's Autumn Statement Mr Osborne announced that maternity pay
would be uprated by just one per cent, instead of in line with 
inflation, in a move dubbed the 'Mummy Tax'.

Together
with JSA, income support, house benefit and statutory sick pay, the 1 
per cent increase for three years will save £1.43billion by 2014-15.

New
mothers receive 90 per cent of their average salary for the first six 
weeks of maternity leave, and £136.78 for the next 33 weeks.

But the cost of providing the benefit has soared from £193million in 1987-88 to £2.4billion this year.

Official Treasury forecasts suggest it will rise further, hitting £2.571billion by 2017-18.

In the Commons Mr Cameron said the only spending exempt from a new welfare spending cap would be the state pension as Labour accused him of not being family friendly.

The Prime Minister said it was important to distribute benefits held within the cap ‘properly’.

Mothers currently receive 90 per cent of their salary for the first six weeks of maternity leave, and then £136.78 for the next 33 weeks

Labour policy on the welfare cap also descended into confusion.

Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves told BBC's Daily Politics 'yes we would include state pensions' in the welfare cap.

But shadow chancellor Ed Balls made clear that the £95billion bill for the basic state pension would not be subject to the overall limit on benefits spending.

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Rachel Reeves has let the cat out of the bag - Labour would rather cut the state pension than benefits. 

'While the Conservatives have increased the state pension by £650 and are specifically excluding it from our welfare cap, Labour risk a return to the days of their 75p rises.'

During Prime Minister's questions, 
Labour MP Fiona O'Donnell asked: ‘While the Prime Minister is trying to 
come over all family friendly can you confirm if maternity and paternity
pay will be included in the benefits cap announced in the Autumn 
Statement?’

Mr Cameron 
replied: ‘As the Chancellor announced at the time what is out of the 
benefit cap is the basic state pension, I think that's important.

‘On
all other welfare spending what we have to do is make sure we are 
distributing properly between the different sorts of welfare.’

Speaking
later, Ms O’Donnell told MailOnline: ‘The Prime Minister looked 
extremely uncomfortable, no wonder that is trying to look like he is 
working-family-friendly, talking about flexible maternity and paternity 
leave when the reality for families under this government is very 
difficult.

‘For him to talk about this being a family-friendly government is really a joke, but a joke in very poor taste.

‘They are good at grabbing headlines but not actually looking at the detail.

‘Yes, we need sensible welfare expenditure, we would support a cap.

‘But
at the same time you have to balance that with meeting need and this is
where the government I think has really got it wrong.

‘When
they use the language of skivers and defrauding the system we are also 
talking about people trying to provide for their families in very 
difficult times.

‘Why is he picking on families that are working hard to try to get on in life?’

Downing Street later said the welfare cap ‘obliges the Government and future governments to look across the board at welfare pressures to ensure that there is fairness on taxpayers.

Asked whether a baby boom could result in cuts to maternity pay because of the cap, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ‘The point about the welfare cap is to be able to consider the pressures that there are across the welfare system to ensure that it is always affordable.

‘The parts of the welfare budget that are not in the welfare cap are the ones around the automatic stabilisers.’
