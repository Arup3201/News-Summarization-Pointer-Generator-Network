On the hungover morning after the World Cup-winning night before, Argentina’s chief of police reported: ‘There were 12 million people rejoicing in the centre of Buenos Aires last night - and not a glass was broken.’

In the pregnant hours before Brazil set the ball rolling for their Copa do Mundo the people of Sao Paulo, never mind the odd cracked beer bottle, are fearful of half their city being smashed to smithereens.

Argentina 1978 provided the most intense, passionate and atmospheric finals in the history of the greatest sporting show on earth.

So far.

Party time: Argentina fans shower their team in ticker tape following their first World Cup win in 1978

Avalanche: Supporters show their pleasure

When FIFA finally elected to bring football back to the spiritual home of the beautiful game for the first time since 1950, it did so in expectation of Brazil staging an even more captivating and colourful spectacle than their fiercest and closest of nationalistic rivals.

Not protesters and riot police on the streets. Not anti-World Cup strikes crippling public transport.Surely the hypnotic rhythms of the samba would drown out those haunting echoes of the melancholy tango from 36 long years ago.

Perhaps they still will.

Argentina started their home cup of dreams against the nightmare background of that country’s Dirty War, in which thousands of opponents of the ruling military junta disappeared.

Mothers and wives were gathering daily outside Eva Peron’s old pink palace, the Casa Rosada, wailing for information about their lost loved ones.

At the opening match of the World Cup those political prisoners who had not been buried in mass graves or pushed out of aeroplanes over the South Atlantic could hear the roars of the crowd from their concentration camp, a mile from the River Plate Stadium.

Yet from this grim beginning – more ghastly even than the poverty afflicting swathes of the Brazilian people - arose a vast ground-swell of euphoric, patriotic support of their football heroes.

As a consequence the World Cup became a powerful tool for international exposure of those atrocities.

One man, perhaps more than any other, made that possible.

Not a politician. Not a civil rights campaigner. Not even Mario Kempes with the goals which gave Argentina their first World Cup.

Cesar Luis Menotti – that charismatic, chain-smoking manager of the team – was to become the visible proof that you could defy the Generals. And live.

The incurable romantic that he is, Menotti had no intention of selecting players from the most successful club in his country – because their achievements relied more on foul means than fair.

Boca Juniors, under cynical coach Juan Carlos Lorenzo, had kicked their way to everything from the Argentine championship to the fore-runner of the World Club Cup and been branded the Butchers of Buenos Aires.

With the exception of Alberto Tarantini, the odd-man-out as a stylish full back whose temporary transfer to Birmingham he helped expedite before naming his squad, Menotti rejected all Lorenzo’s players.

Cavalier: Ossie Ardiles

The Generals, in their hope of a sporting triumph to distract attention from their crimes against humanity, were outraged. When Menotti refused to compromise, he was threatened with execution if he failed to win the World Cup.

Cesar Luis shrugged, lit another cigarette and carried on about his business. Thus he became the standard bearer not only for the World Cup fantasy but also the resistance to Argentina’s dictators.From the metropolis to the mountains, from the sea-shore to the Pampas, the country wrapped itself in flags of blue and white. The entire nation rallied behind Menotti and his team. 

They did not disappoint.

Stars like Ossie Ardiles were Menotti’s lieutenants in what was now a multi-dimensional crusade.

They strove to play cavalier football in the idiom of their Bohemian manager, coupled with a dynamism which galvanised their fellow countrymen.

Football fever raged and not only at their own games

Roaring crowds waved a fond farewell to a Scotland of split personality – drew with Iran, lost to Peru yet beat Holland too late – kissed goodbye to France (Platini et al) and said a relieved goodbye to West Germany.

For Argentina, if they were to deny arch-enemy Brazil, the door to the final had to be unlocked by at least four goals against Peru in what was then the second group stage.

After they scored six the accusations of bribery and corruption came thick and fast. Those suspicions were never substantiated and did Argentina less than justice.

If Peru were selling the game then they were incredibly deceptive and accurate in the way they went about doing so.

They hit the inside of a post twice before Argentina scored and came scorchingly close again before the hosts reached their optimum score. From that day to this every Peruvian who took part has vehemently denied the allegations.

Nor are those slurs consistent with Menotti’s idealism, the sense of honour with which Ardiles is imbued, the heroic leadership of captain Daniel Passarella.

The people believed not a word of it, focusing instead on the challenged about to be presented by the Dutch on the banks of the River Plate.

Johan Cruyff had refused to travel to South America following death and kidnap threats to himself and his family. But Total Football  was still alive, well and in the final, for the second time running following defeat by Germany four years earlier.

The kick-off was delayed as Argentina questioned the legality of a the plaster cast which Holland forward Rene van de Kerkhof came out wearing to protect his damaged wrist. It did appear to present a risk to opponents but was allowed.

The Dutch protested that the lengthy dispute had raised the tension and volume of a crowd obviously hostile to them. For certain this World Cup was about to come to a cacophonous crescendo and the response to the opening goal from Kempes was ear-bursting. There was an animal howl of anguish as Dick Naninga equalised eight minutes from normal team and the closest we came to silence was when Rob Rensenbrink struck an Argentine post in the dying seconds.

The jubilations began when Kempes scored his sixth of the tournament, in extra time, and raised the roof when a clincher from Daniel Bertoni followed.

As hundreds of thousands hurried to reach the downtown, the eight lanes of the highway from the stadium as well as the sidewalks and the grass verges came to a bumper-to-bumper standstill. Most of us walked in the last couple of miles over the backs of trucks and the roofs and bonnets of cars and buses, without our feet touching the ground.

The Falkland Islands were to move to the forefront of the military’s agenda thereafter, provoking a war with Thatcher’s Britain. And those specks of land remain an issue between us, as we have been reminded this week by the latest Argentine team posing behind a Las Malvinas banner on arrival in Brazil.

But on that night in July 1978 a people who had been made to feel unclean by their sinister Generals were given back their pride by the courageous idealism of a football manager and his players.

Two evenings later Menotti invited me to join them at a private celebration in a small hotel.

Weeks earlier, as the public responded to his defiance of the dictators, he had promised that if Argentina won the World Cup he would run with his people through the streets.

Menotti asked all we who were present to remove our jackets and shirts (mercifully I was a lot younger then) and Passarella handed out blue and white scarves for us to tie as bandanas around our foreheads.

The word was out on the streets and thousands were waiting. Out we went to run in a huge phalanx along the main boulevard of Buenos Aires, the Avenida de 9 Julio, around the monument to the Argentine Republic, the Obelisk, and back to the bar.

There was not a hint of trouble, not a swear word out of place... and not a glass broken.

The experience was exhilarating and the time it took for the heart to stop beating sends a message down the years to the samba drummers and dancers of Brazil 2014.

No, don’t stop the carnival.
