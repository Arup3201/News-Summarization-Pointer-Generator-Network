Biscuit-eaters were today recovering from a shock announcement that has turned their world (quite literally) upside down.

What they thought was the top of their beloved McVitie's Digestives and Hobnobs is actually the bottom... so they've been eating them the wrong way up all these years.

It may be only a few days until the tomfoolery of April 1 but this is apparently no joke.

Biscuit-breaking news: McVitie's fans have been told that what they thought was the top of their beloved Digestives and Hobnobs is actually the bottom. The digestive part is, in fact, the top

'The biscuits go through a reservoir of chocolate which enrobes them so the chocolate is actually on the bottom of the biscuits and not on the top,' said Matt Brown, brand director of McVitie's

This revelation was later reinforced in a statement, which read: 'The McVitie's stamp is on the other side, which is the top of the biscuit'

Following a recent thread on Reddit, a spokesman from McVitie's parent company, United Biscuits, confirmed the cold, hard, snack-shaped truth.

Matt Brown, brand director for McVitie’s told Mail Online: 'Certain chocolate-covered biscuits within the McVitie’s range - specifically Chocolate Digestives and Chocolate Hobnobs - go through a reservoir of chocolate which enrobes them so the chocolate is actually on the bottom of the biscuits and not on the top.

'So yes, perhaps people up and down the country have been enjoying them the wrong way up – although we can confirm they’re delicious whichever way you like to eat them!'

A further statement was run by the Independent, which said: 'The McVitie’s stamp is on the other side, which is the top of the biscuit.'

However, the mystery remains why the chocolate side is on the top on the display of the packets.

Not surprisingly, Twitter has been awash with comments.

One poster wrote: 'Eating biscuits whilst doing handstands to try to console ourselves.'

Biscuit fans have reacted on Twitter to the announcement

McVitie’s started making chocolate digestives in 1925 at its factory in Harlesden, North London – and now sells around 80million packs a year in the UK.

In 1985, the new cult brand Hobnobs was launched. Huge demand for the original led to the introduction of the chocolate variety in 1987.

Digestives have been enjoyed by Britons for more than a century, with Huntley & Palmers first advertising them in 1876.

The name comes from the digestive properties they were thought to have because of the amount of baking soda in the recipe.

In
 1892, Edinburgh bakers McVitie & Price made their version of the 
biscuit to a recipe created by young new employee Alexander Grant.

It was their first major biscuit and demand was strong, prompting the building of two new factories.

Another said: 'Chocolate on the bottom?! Game changer.'

The news comes barely a year after chocolate digestive fans were told McVitie's had changed the recipe.

The reformulated biscuits were quietly introduced into supermarkets in December 2012.

Taste testers said the new version was less crunchy, and the topping was more even - even though there was slightly more chocolate than the old one.

And in a blind trial, two-thirds of those tasting the new recipe said they preferred the original.

The snack company said it ‘tweaked’ the ingredients of the brand after receiving feedback from customers.

United Biscuits said at the time that the new biscuit had around 3 per cent more chocolate, and the coating was more even.

However, consumer group Which? found that just one per cent more was added.

Each biscuit contains 86 calories, compared to 85, and slightly more sugar, fat and saturated fat, although experts said the difference was ‘negligible’.

And when 30 shoppers tried both versions, 19 preferred the old recipe.

A spokesman for Which? said: ‘Our 30-strong blind taste test panel preferred the old biscuit, with many mentioning its crunchier texture.’
