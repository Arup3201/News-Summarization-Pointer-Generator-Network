It is often said that if you buy property in a prime inner-city location you are sure to see a healthy return on your investment.

But a new analysis of house prices across Australia shows that it is often the cheaper locations in middle-ring and outer-ring suburbs that see higher rates of house price growth.

A report compiled by property investment website hotspotting.com.au identified the suburbs around Australia where homeowners have seen the best returns on their investment over the past 10 years.

Australia's top property picks by suburb, their median house price and the average annual growth in house prices over the past decade

Researchers analysed the average annual growth in median house prices over the past decade in suburbs in capital cities and towns in regional areas.

But the analysis shows that few so-called 'prime suburbs' in Australia's capital cities have leading capital growth rates.

'Most people can't afford to buy in those suburbs so the market for those areas is quite thin,' said Terry Ryder, founder of Hotspotting.

'Quite a small percentage of people can afford to buy property there.

'People might aspire to buy there but that doesn't translate into demand, and demand is how prices get pushed up.'

In Sydney, the 20 most expensive suburbs all have median prices above $1.7 million – and only one of these suburbs makes the top 20 list for long-term capital growth.

The only exception was Melbourne, with half of the city's 20 most expensive suburbs making the Top 20 list for long-term price growth.

But the report said it was not the 'ritzy south-eastern precinct' around Toorak which dominated the top 20 list – it was million-dollar suburbs east of the CBD such as Deepdene, Mont Albert and Kew.

In comparing capital cities, Darwin was the growth leader with most of its suburbs recording double-digit growth averages.

Sydney and Canberra were the poorest performers, with the worst suburbs in Darwin charting growth rates large enough to make the top 20 lists in Sydney and Canberra.

The report analysed data from Australia Property Monitors, excluding suburbs with fewer than 30 annual sales. It also excluded Hobart as there was no price data dating back 10 years.

SYDNEY

Sydney property has seen a big price growth in the past 12-18 months, but the long-term growth rates of Sydney suburbs remain among the worst in the nation.

The best suburb in Sydney was Pemulwuy in the west, which recorded a median house price of $666,000 and an average growth of 10.2 percent over 10 years.

By contrast, the city's most expensive area Bellevue Hill, in the eastern suburbs, had a median house price of $3.35 million but an average growth of just 4 percent over 10 years.

The suburb with the worst long-term capital growth rate was Sylvania Waters with a median house price of $1.2 million and an average growth of -2.5 percent over 10 years.

MELBOURNE

According to the report, Melbourne is currently the only capital city where the most expensive suburbs dominate the list of best performers in terms of long-term capital growth.

The best suburb in Melbourne was East Melbourne in the inner-city, which recorded a median house price of $1.68 million and an average growth of 10.9 percent over 10 years.

The city's most expensive area Toorak, in the south-east, had a median house price of $2.4 million but an average growth of just 6.7 percent over 10 years.

The suburb with the worst long-term capital growth rate was Portsea with a median house price of $1.1 million and an average growth of 2.3 percent over 10 years.

BRISBANE

In Brisbane the leading suburbs for long-term capital growth were a mixture of middle market and bottom end locations.

The best suburb in Brisbane was Bulimba, north-east of the CBD, which recorded a median house price of $840,000 and an average growth of 7.9 percent over 10 years.

The city's most expensive area Chandler, in the east, had a median house price of $1.2 million but an average growth of 5.4 percent over 10 years.

DARWIN

The report said that a genuine shortage of dwellings in Darwin had led to the city having the highest residential rents and highest capital growth rates of any Australian capital city.

The best suburb in Darwin was Berrimah in the inner-east, which recorded a median house price of $947,000 and an average growth of 15.2 percent over 10 years.

The city's most expensive area Larrakeyah, in inner Darwin, had a median house price only just higher than Berrimah at $950,000 but it recorded an average growth of only 6.3 percent over 10 years.

Larrakeyah was the suburb with the worst long-term capital growth rate.

PERTH

Perth was the second best in Australia on capital growth, ranking only marginally behind Darwin and well ahead of the third-ranked Melbourne.

The best suburb in Perth was Bullsbrook, north-east of the CBD, which recorded a median house price of $380,000 and an average growth of 10.9 percent over 10 years.

The city's most expensive area Peppermint Grove, on the north bank of the Swan River, had a median house price of $3.5 million and an average growth of 8.7 percent over 10 years.

ADELAIDE

Adelaide's overall performance was better than Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane's and only slightly worse than Melbourne's record.

The best suburb in Adelaide was Munno Para, in the north, which recorded a median house price of $300,000 and an average growth of 9.3 percent over 10 years.

Canberra, along with Sydney, was the poorest performer in terms of capital growth.

The best suburb in Canberra was Harrison in the north, which recorded a median house price of $570,000 and an average growth of 11.6 percent over 10 years.

The city's most expensive area Griffith, in the inner-city, had a median house price of $1.08 million but an average growth of just 3.4 percent over 10 years.

REGIONAL

Long-term capital growth rates were on average much higher in regional Australia than they were in metropolitan areas, thanks in large part to the mining boom.

Fifteen towns in the regional top 20 were resource centres or towns that have been boosted recently by mining activity.

The top town for long-term capital growth was Newman in the East Pilbara, with a median house price of $780,000 and an average growth of 22.2 percent over 10 years.

But the report warned that mining towns are no longer in favour with property investors, because most mining towns have suffered marked decreases in property values and rentals in the past 12-18 months either through dwelling oversupply or a sharp decline in demand from buyers and tenants.
