Ed Miliband is 'lobbying hard' for a one-to-one White House meeting with Barack Obama in a bid to convince voters he is a Prime Minister in waiting, it was claimed today.

The Labour leader allegedly hopes his links with the US President's former advisor David Axelrod will smoothe the way for a meeting in Washington.

But Mr Miliband's success blocking Britain's involvement in military action in Syria has left 'bruises' in Washington, a former senior aide to Mr Obama has revealed.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is said to be desperate for a one-to-one meeting with US President Barack Obama, in a bid to boost his image as a Prime Minister in waiting

PJ Crowley, a former Assistant Secretary of State, said Mr Miliband’s opposition to strikes on Syria had angered the White House.

He said: 'I’m sure there are some bruises from the experience of last Fall. The rejection in the House of Commons did have ripple effects here in terms of how the president confronted the prospect of a military strike against Syria. It did alter the President’s strategy.'

Mr Miliband was accused of 'playing politics' with the vote over Syria - after first indicating to the Prime Minister that he would back strikes before withdrawing Labour's support.

Mr Cameron's Commons defeat forced the US President to step back from military action, with only the French left backing armed intervention.

Mr Crowley added that the President may not find the time for Mr Miliband - even if the Labour leader turned up in Washington.

A Labour spokesman said the report, aired on the BBC this morning, was just 'speculation'.

But according to the report, Mr Miliband is 'very keen' to meet the US President before May’s election.

Mr Miliband met the US President at Buckingham Palace when Mr Obama visited the UK on a State Visit in May 2011.

But a White House meeting would spark memories of Tony Blair's successful talks with Bill Clinton in 1996 - a year before sweeping to victory.

Labour were said to be delighted after French President Francois Hollande posed with Mr Miliband outside the Elysée Palace in Paris.

Mr Blair was the last leader of the Opposition to be welcomed to the White House.

During a press call afterwards, journalists asked President Clinton: 'Do you hope that you’re sitting next to the next Prime Minister of the UK?'

Mr Clinton, who was facing re-election, replied: 'I just hope he’s sitting next to the next President of the United States.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband is 'very keen' for a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House, according to the BBC

Mr Cameron has cultivated a close relationship with the US President, despite the traditional ties between the US Democrats and the Labour party

Jonathan Powell, who organised Mr Blair's trip, told the BBC: 'It’s the nearest that a leader of an opposition gets to a job interview. It has to go right. If it goes wrong, there are very serious consequences back home.'

He said Mr Miliband should not organise the meeting in Washington unless he can be certain that it will go well - otherwise his chances of becoming Prime Minister could be damaged irrevocably.

Mr Powell said Neil Kinnock’s meeting with President Reagan in 1986 went 'disastrously wrong' after the White House attacked Labour’s stance on nuclear disarmament.

Tory MP Priti Patel said Mr Miliband's bid for a meeting with President Obama was 'pretty desperate'.

She said: 'Ed Miliband’s scrambling around for a date with Obama – it’s obviously a last-ditch attempt to rescue his flagging public image.

'But it will take more than begging for a photo op with the American President to convince the British public he could be PM.'
