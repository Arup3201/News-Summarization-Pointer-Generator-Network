Yaya Toure's form at Manchester City is coming under increasing scrutiny at the highest level of the club after he was sent off during the 2-1 home defeat against CSKA Moscow.

Toure, one of the highest-paid players in the Barclays Premier League on £225,000 a week, has yet to rediscover the form that fired City to the title last season.

The midfielder, who scored City’s equaliser from a free-kick at the Etihad on Wednesday night, was later sent off for stupidly shoving Roman Eremenko in the face.

Toure, 31, has since apologised to City supporters, but he appears disaffected at the club. 

He has a contract until 2017 and has one of the biggest bonus packages in the history of English football in his contract. 

He is paid £823,000 each time City qualify for the Champions League and an extra £412,000 if they win it. That clause is unlikely to be activated any time soon, as the Premier League champions lie bottom of their group without a win.

Manuel Pellegrini’s transfer strategy is also coming under increasing scrutiny from Manchester City’s billionaire owner Sheikh Mansour.

Fernando, Fernandinho, Eliaquim Mangala, Jesus Navas and Stevan Jovetic are among the expensive imports who are struggling to justify their massive salaries and transfer fees.
