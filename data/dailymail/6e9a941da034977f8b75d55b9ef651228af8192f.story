Book: Jeremy Clarkson's ex-wife Alex Hall wants to write about the details of her marriage to the Top Gear star

The first wife of TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson labelled him a 'bully and a hypocrite' as she lifted the lid on their alleged clandestine 10-year affair today.

In a revealing interview, Alex Hall claimed she 'still loved' Top Gear presenter Clarkson, but that she'd had enough of being portrayed as a 'blackmailer' for wanting to write a book about their marriage.

The mother-of-two said she felt forced to defend herself after revelations about their alleged affair, which purportedly happened while he was married to second wife Francie, were made public this week.

Clarkson has denied the affair and, according to her, she has come under heavy criticism from her ex-husband's supporters, it has been reported.

She told the Daily Star Sunday: 'I am standing up to rich bullies. Because of his lies and bullying I have to fight back and defend myself and think about my family.

'I have never, ever let him down and have been a discreet, decent, loyal ex-wife who has never said a word to the papers, until now. But now I've had enough.'

This week TV presenter 
Clarkson lifted a gagging order on Miss Hall which banned her from 
revealing intimate details of their relationship, after deciding court 
injunctions were ‘pointless.’

The father-of-three won an injunction last year against his first wife, whom he married in 1989.

The pair first met through friends when Alex was 17 and Clarkson was 22.

They quickly moved in together and lived together for eight years, even sharing an office in Fulham, where he ran Motoring Press Agency and she ran Alltypes, a secretarial services business.

The court order prevented her from 
publishing ‘information to the effect that AMM (Clarkson) and HXW (Hall)
have had a sexual relationship since AMM married his present wife’.

The injunction also banned details of
‘sexual or other intimate acts or dealings’ between the couple, and 
confidential information about Clarkson’s ‘sexual life, his relationship
with others, his private thoughts and feelings, his health, or his 
financial affairs’.

But 
Clarkson, 51, said he had regretted it from the day it was granted and 
decided to unmask himself and lift the High Court order on Wednesday.

He
said injunctions could not prevent comments being published in the 
‘legal free world on Twitter and the internet’. He also said that his 
mother had been seriously ill when he went to the High Court last 
October.

Miss Hall said she had 'honoured and loved' Clarkson throughout their alleged relationship - before and after they were wed - and even blamed her feelings for him for the break up of her second marriage.

She added: 'Even though the injunction terrified me and I have trembled for a month, I have honoured and loved him for 28 years.'

The pair married in 1989 at St Andrews Church, South Warnborough, Hampshire, and went on honeymoon to Mauritius.

Among their guests were Steve Hall, Alex's second husband, and Clarkson's second wife Frances Cain, 50 who he went on to marry in 1993.

Miss Hall said she deeply regrets the break-up but claims she fell for their mutual friend Steve about a year after she married Clarkson.

She has denied she left the Top Gear presenter because he was a 'opinionated lazy slob' and said she felt it would be the honourable thing to leave Clarkson after believing she had feelings for Steve.

Miss Hall claims she quickly regretted this and asked Clarkson for forgiveness but she said he wanted to punish her and decided that it was best she live on her own for a while.

Miss Hall then married Steve in 1993 and had two children with him but they divorced in 1996 after he realised she was still in love with her former husband.

Miss Hall also claimed that she initially had no intention of revealing anything about her alleged affair in the book and only told Clarkson she was writing memoirs about their marriage out of 'courtesy'.

However, he reacted by telling her he would not 'let her write' about their relationship or their marriage - even historically, she has claimed.

Despite revealing her anger at the furore surrounding the revelations - and, what she sees as, a subsequent smear campaign against her - the 46-year-old, from Surrey said she would still take Clarkson back.

Fight-back: Miss Hall seen in London last week after the revelations about the alleged affair were made public

She told the Sunday Express: Yes, I still love Jeremy and have feelings for him. I want him back. I don't feel we committed adultery during the affair because he was my husband.

'He was like a pair of comfy slippers. I know he'll call again in about six months. I will see him and it will carry on.'

They allegedly reunited for an illicit affair in 1999, after the millionaire met her for lunch at the Pharmacy restaurant in Nootting Hill, west London.

Miss Hall said she met Clarkson at his Fulham flat later that night and ended up having sex in a blue-striped sofa bed which they had owned when they were married.

It was after that night that they continued to see each other and Miss Hall claims Clarkson would come to her home in Surrey after a full day filming Top Gear at the Dunsfold track.

She even claims the pair stayed together at Madonna's faviourite hotel, the four-star Parador de Ronda in southern Spain while he was filming in 2007. 

Miss Hall said the pair rarely went outdoors for fear of being photographed together.

In 2009, on September 22 and what would have been their 20th anniversary, Miss Hall said she received a text message from Clarkson which said: 'Do you know what day it is?'

She claims he sent this because, like her, he has not been able to move on after the break-up of their marriage.

Miss Hall claims Frances 'turned a blind eye' to the alleged affair. She also revealed that leaving Clarkson was one of her biggest mistakes.
