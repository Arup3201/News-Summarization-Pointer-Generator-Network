He may have been seated in the VIP section, but Prince Harry showed he was no different to any other England fan as he watched the team limp to a 0-0 draw against Costa Rica in Brazil.

The Prince pulled an array of tortured facial expressions, sharing the agony of his fellow supporters, as the team failed to make an impact against a second string Costa Rica side before flying home from the tournament with just a single point.

But it wasn't all bad for the royal however, as he did manage to attract the attention of several female fans in the crowd at the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte.

Passion: He may have been seated in the VIP seats, but Prince Harry showed he was no different to any other England fan as he watched the team take on Costa Rica

Tortured: The Prince pulled an array of tortured facial expressions, sharing the agony of his fellow supporters, as the team failed to make an impact against a second string Costa Rica side

Spectator: Harry takes in the match from the VIP section at the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte

Tense: As the match went on, with England unable to score, Harry appeared to become increasingly stressed in the Brazilian heat

Pained: Harry, who is rumoured to be an Arsenal fan, watches England in Brazil. Fortunately he had not travelled to South America just to see the game

He thinks it's all over... it is now: Harry has his head in his hands as England drop out of the tournament and prepare to fly back to London

The prince had been all smiles when he arrived at the stadium, and was seen proudly singing the national anthem as the teams made their way onto the pitch.

He shook hands with some of the digintaries in the box and sat down with his private secretary, Edward Lane-Fox, and with Alberto Pinto Coelho, the governor of the state of Minas Gerais.

FA chairman Mr Dyke and Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA's director of football development who will retire after the World Cup, sat further along the same row to the Prince's right.

But as the game wore on he became visibly tense, and at one point appeared to hold his head in his hands, unable to watch the action on the pitch.

With little riding on the game, as Costa Rica had already qualified as Group D winners, Prince Harry, who is rumoured to be an Arsenal fan, found himself to be the main attraction when he arrived to take his seat.

Greeting: Despite his anguish, Harry manages to wave at the crowds of supporters inside the stadium

Head scratcher: Harry seems perplexed - could he be wondering why the England team had failed to light up the tournament?

Bowing out: Still holding his head, Harry leaves the stadium after the final whistle, with England only managing a draw

Handsome in a navy suit, he prince was greeted with a sea of banners, among them one held up by a Brazilian supporter teaming her yellow shirt with a veil, that made him break into a bashful smile thanks to the legend: 'Harry - Marry Me?'

Earlier, Harry spoke of his sadness at England's early exit from the tournament as he met children at the Minas Tênis Clube before making one excited little girl giggle as he presented her with a medal, and getting between the goal posts for a penalty shoot out with another group.

The prince
 was joined by FA chairman Greg Dyke and told him that he was 'really 
sad' that England had failed to progress during the tour of the 
athletics venue.

'It's
 a shame Harry didn't come last week, he probably would have helped,' 
added Dyke. 'I feel really sorry for Harry and our fans that we didn't 
have a chance of staying on - but that's life.

'It's such small margins, we basically played better here then we have for the last two World Cups.'

The two men chatted during a business brunch at the sports centre, where a rare copy of the original regulations for football - drawn up in 1863 - was on show before being presented to the Sao Paulo football museum at a later date.

'The couple of games that I watched I thought that we played really well,' said Prince Harry. 'It's the best England team we've had for some time - but hey, you win some you lose some.'

Much better: Luckily for Prince Harry, his basketball skills proved considerably more impressive than his goal-keeping

The prince, who is on a seven-day tour of Brazil and Chile, and Mr Dyke were shown around the facility which is set to be the base for Team GB athletes during the 2016 Olympics, by César Cielo - the winner of Brazil's only Olympic swimming gold medal.

Originally intended to be used as a zoo, the vast club has more than 1,000 athletes on its books, a huge swimming pool and its own stadium, the Juscelino Kubitschek Arena.

Among the British athletes likely to be selected for Brazil are Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford - all of whom racked up Olympic gold medals in their events during the 2012 London Games.

One man who is unlikely to be spotted on the track, however, is Prince Harry who made headlines during a visit to Jamaica after he played fast and loose with the rules to win a sprint against Usain Bolt.

As the sprinter waited for the starting whistle, the prince sped off, leaving the unsuspecting Bolt trailing in his wake - much to the amusement of watching locals.

This time around, Harry confined himself to presenting medals and indulging in a few jokes and a chat with young athletes, although he did shoot some hoops with a Brazilian judo star.

The
 prince turned down an offer to grapple with Luciano Correa 
who is hoping to win a medal when his country hosts the next Olympic 
Games, and battled it out for the honours on the basketball court instead.

When Harry's first shot hit the rim of the hoop and bounced away he waved his hand in mock disgust and walked off. Two further efforts were also off the mark but the judo player's aim was just as bad. Correa joked afterwards: 'My ability with the basketball and Harry's was not good we both need to practice.'

Later, the prince will be driven to the Estádio Mineirão for England's dead rubber match against Costa Rica, who are already in the second round.

Tomorrow, as the Three Lions fly home, Harry will continue on to Brazil's largest city São Paulo, where he will meet conservationists campaigning to save the Amazon rainforest and disadvantaged local children.  

One,
 two, three... Scream! Prince Harry was met by hordes of overexcited
