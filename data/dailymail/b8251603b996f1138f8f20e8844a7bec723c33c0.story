The World Cup kicks off today and a new report reveals more women than men are embracing the games as a 'sociable event' ideal for watching at a friend's house and inspiring some culinary experimentation.

A quarter (25 per cent) of women claim to be 'very excited' about the World Cup.

And according to new figures more women than men strongly associate with the social side of the World Cup.

When were asked to rank 20 words 
describing the event, women ranked the sociability attribute much 
higher than men - third behind energetic and masculine.

Furthermore a third (33 per cent) plan to watch the games at a friend's house, 10 per cent more than men.

Women 
prove themselves to be quite the connoisseurs and reveal they are open 
to trying Brazilian cuisine as a result of the World Cup - more so than 
men.

When
 tested on Brazilian food knowledge they knew their carioca beans, 
caiprinhas and guava paste from imitation products - such as Pot Noodle 
Brazilian BBQ Steak - better than their male counterparts.

Furthermore
 women are more interested than men in trying lacta diamante negro 
chocolate, coconut cake, caipirinha cocktails and cheese bread mix; 
while men are more interested in Brahma beer.

Three in five (60 per cent) say they 
will at least watch some of the football matches. But more women than 
men say the games they watch will most likely be limited to England 
games or the final.

A spokesperson for MMR Research Worldwide who conducted the research, said: 'Plenty of women are excited about the impending blanket of all things football and even if they aren't that interested, they are still benefiting from the World Cup buzz.

'This festival extends beyond the sport into the cultural side of things, including trying Brazilian food and socialising. The sport of football, broadcasters and brands should find the right ways to engage with women,'

Alternative viewing platforms such as smartphones and tablets are more popular than ever but 96 per cent of those surveyed still plan to watch live games on the TV set in their living room.

According to the study, 16 to 34-year-olds are more likely to watch live games on their smartphone, tablet, computer or via connected TV than any other age bracket, but even the majority of this age group say they will still mainly watch matches on TV.

'Watching matches on terrestrial television from the comfort of their sofa in the living room remains by far the most popular way football fans will enjoy the World Cup,' says the spokesperson.

'Despite the proliferation of smartphones and tablets, and huge investment by Sky and other broadcasters in on the go services, the data clearly shows that the viewing habits of football fans have hardly changed since England last won the World Cup in 1966.'

When asked which team they thought would win the World Cup, most respondents to the survey placed Brazil, Germany and Spain before England.
