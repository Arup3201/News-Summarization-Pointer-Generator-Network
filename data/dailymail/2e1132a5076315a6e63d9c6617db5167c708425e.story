A celebrated former ballerina was told by the country’s most  senior judges yesterday that the State has no duty to provide her with a helper so she can live with dignity in her own home.

Stroke victim Elaine McDonald – once described as Britain’s best classical dancer – lost an appeal to the Supreme Court for a night-time carer.

Judges, with one exception, said she had no right to demand a helper and that social workers were within the law when they withdrew the carer to save £22,000 a year.

Elaine McDonald, 68,  lost an appeal at the Supreme Court yesterday.  The former ballerina (pictured performing in Swan Lake in 1983) said she needed an overnight carer to help her keep her 'dignity'

Coming at a time of massive spending 
cuts, the test case cleared the way for local authorities across the 
country to reduce the help they provide to the elderly and disabled so 
they can remain in their own homes.

Over
the past five years councils have already cut back heavily on the way 
they use their £14billion-a-year social care budget to provide such 
personal help at home.

Yesterday
the judges found there was nothing in law to say that Miss McDonald 
should have assistance from the state and that human rights rules did 
not cover her case.

The 
judgment means that 68-year-old Miss McDonald must use incontinence pads
– although she is not incontinent – because she needs to reach the 
bathroom three times a night but cannot do so without help.

Warning: Baroness Hale of Richmond, pictured being sworn in onto the Supreme Court in 2009, said she would have granted the appeal but was outvoted

The ruling brought an angry response from the dissenting judge, Lady Hale.

She
said: ‘We are, I still believe, a civilised society. I would have 
allowed this appeal. In the United Kingdom we do not oblige  people who 
can control their bodily functions to behave as if they cannot do so.

‘I
am troubled by the implications of the (majority) view. A person in her
situation needs this help during the day as well as during the night.

‘Logically,
the decision of the majority in this case would entitle a local 
authority to withdraw this help even though the client might be left 
lying in her faeces until the carers came in the morning.

‘This is not Miss McDonald’s problem at the moment, but her evidence leaves one in no doubt that this is one of her fears.

‘Indeed,
the majority view would also entitle an authority to withdraw this help
during the day. The only constraint would be how frequently (or rather 
how infrequently) it was deemed necessary to change the pads or sheets, 
consistently with the avoidance of infection and other hazards such as 
nappy rash.

‘The consequences do not bear  thinking about.’

The
clawback, in which social workers have gradually set higher and higher 
thresholds of illness and  disability before people are allowed help, 
has been detailed by the Daily Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly 
campaign.

The Supreme Court
decision means further cutbacks are certain to come for 557,000 people,
368,000 of them elderly, who rely on help at home at the discretion of 
local authority social workers.

The ruling by five judges brought fierce criticism from charities.

Michelle
Mitchell of Age UK said it was ‘shameful’ and added: ‘Older people have
a fundamental right to dignity. This judgment opens the door to 
warehousing older people in their own homes without regard to their 
quality of life.’

Fight: Kensington and Chelsea council said Ms McDonald should use pads at night even though she is not incontinent

Miss 
McDonald, who was prima ballerina for Scottish Ballet and received an 
OBE in 1983, had a stroke in 1999 which left her with ‘severely limited 
mobility’.

She has no children, and her partner, theatre lighting designer Donald McLeish, used to help at night but can no longer do so.

The
Supreme Court judgment said Miss McDonald ‘suffers from a small and 
neurogenic bladder which means she has to urinate some two to three 
times a night’.

She has until now ‘accessed a commode with the help of a carer’ provided by the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

The
judges recognised that in her opinion ‘the thought of being treated as 
incontinent (which she is not) and having to use pads is an intolerable 
affront to her dignity.’

But
the majority of the judges said the council was free to change its 
‘care plan’ for Miss McDonald and that it was free to decide what her 
needs were.

The Supreme Court sits in London and is the UK's highest court

They found that
the council’s social workers had not infringed Miss McDonald’s right to
privacy and a family life under Article Eight of the European human 
rights convention – a clause that has nevertheless allowed hundreds of 
foreign criminals to escape deportation.

Miss
McDonald said: ‘I have paid my dues since I was 16 – I am not a 
scrounger. But now I need care and that is being denied me. And I fear 
that my case will be used by other councils against other people so they
don’t have to provide them with the care they need.

‘That idea is horrific.

‘I have the right to live with dignity,’ she added.

‘And
for me that means to be able to go to bed knowing that I have the help I
need to go to the toilet in the middle of the night. Having night-time 
care would give me the freedom not to worry all day about what will 
happen at night.’

Elaine McDonald, once a star  performer in a profession which demands supreme physical fitness, now needs day and night help to lead a decent life.

Even the Supreme Court judges were moved by her plight. They began their explanation of their decision with the words: ‘Ill health can be dreadfully cruel.’

Miss McDonald, however, has not yet lost her dignity nor the determination that once made her one of the country’s top classical dancers.

She said that in the aftermath of her stroke in 1999 ‘the doctors told me I would never walk again. They had never come across the determination of a ballerina.

‘Now I can walk if someone is there to supervise me.’

Born in Leeds in 1943, she trained at the Royal Ballet School and by the 1980s was considered the best ballerina in the country.

She shares the ground floor flat in West London where she has lived for 40 years with her cat Mi Fun. Theatre photographs and ballet posters decorate the walls.

Her 57-year-old partner Donald McLeish, a theatre lighting designer, provides her with some help but has moved out after having a nervous breakdown.

She must rely on others for almost all her needs and used to have a care ‘package’ that meant someone was there to help around the clock. But this has been scaled down to four time slots. A carer attends between 8.30am and 10.30am, from 1pm to 2pm, from 5pm to 5.30pm and from 8pm to 8.30pm. She must rely on her partner or friends at other times.

Mr McLeish said of Kensington and Chelsea Council: ‘They determined that she needed night-time care. Now they are ignoring their own expert advice.

‘I have done my best to look after Elaine but I suffered a nervous breakdown due to the strain.’
