Millions of ducks raised for the dinner table are being denied essentials like a pond to swim and bathe in, warns the RSPCA.

The charity is calling on families to boycott duck meat until farmers and supermarkets implement dramatic improvements to the way the birds are treated.

It says the reality for the 14.3m ducks reared for meat in the UK every year is very different from the Beatrix Potter and Jemima Puddle-duck view of farm life.

Poor conditions: Ducks are often crammed into barns in their thousands in the semi-darkness without water to swim in

In fact, most are reared in barns, where thousands of birds are crammed together in semi-darkness, and they never get a chance to get their feet wet, let alone swim around.

The RSPCA said not one of these ducks are raised according to the minimum welfare standards it supports under its ‘Freedom Food’ scheme and it is demanding new laws to improve conditions.

However, producers insist there is no need to provide ponds as ducks ‘have a low motivation to swim for any length of time’.

A survey by the RSPCA found most consumers have no idea how the ducks are raised and most would be appalled that they do not get access to water to swim and bathe in.

Calling for action: The RSPCA wants conditions to improve for the millions of ducks reared for meat in the UK

There are no legal requirements to provide farmed ducks with anything other than water to drink, and the duck industry’s own standards, through the Red Tractor scheme, only require ducks to be able to cover their heads with water.

Welfare expert at the RSPCA, Dr Marc Cooper, said: ‘Ducks are waterfowl, therefore they should be provided with water that allows them full body access. This is not only good for their health, as it helps keep their eyes, nostrils and feathers clean, but it also allows them to do the things they naturally want to do.

‘It is disheartening that we are in a situation where the vast majority of farmed ducks are not provided with full body access to water.

‘We want consumers to know the facts about how farmed ducks have been reared, and we want the industry to take on board the evidence within the report and help improve the lives of millions of ducks.’

A YouGov survey for the RSPCA found that four in ten parents are likely to take children to a local pond or lake to feed the ducks. Yet the vast majority - 93 per cent - were unaware that it is not a legal requirement for farmed ducks to have bathing water they can get into.

Some 78 per cent were ‘appalled’ that ducks farmed for their meat may never get access to bathing water.

A new RSPCA report calls on shoppers to stop buying the meat until improvements are made.

It warns: ‘It is very difficult for consumers to find any meat from ducks reared to welfare standards the RSPCA would find acceptable.

‘So unless they can be confident that this is the case, they are strongly encourage to avoid buying duck meat due to welfare concerns associated with poorer rearing conditions.’

‘Unfortunately current UK law does not require water to be provided to ducks for anything other than drinking, and ducks may only have access to water from drinkers such as nipple drinkers.

‘We believe the law should be changed so that producers are legally required to provide farmed ducks with suitable open water facilities that allow them fully body access.’

The British Poultry Council said ducks do not need water to swim and bathe in and it is not practical for farmers to provide it. The organisation claimed ducks ‘have a low motivation to swim for any length of time’.

British favourite: The RSPCA have called on shoppers to stop buying the meat until improvements are made

It has set up a Duck Assurance Scheme (DAS) to cover rearing policies and ensures there is enough water to allow the ducks to dip their heads in and use the water to preen their feathers.

The BPC said the standards used by the RSPCA ‘have been drawn up by a working group lacking in any practical experience of growing ducks on a commercial scale’.

It said: ‘It is not practical to provide deep water for swimming - especially in indoor systems- and ducks do have a low motivation to swim for any length of time.

‘Open water sources, particularly those in which ducks can get in, have poor water quality which can lead to bacterial infections of the eyes and nostrils. Keeping eyes, nostrils, feet and plumage clean is key to good duck health and welfare and is provided for the form of open water resource in the DAS.

‘The DAS requires that ducks must have sufficient space to be able to sit without interference from other birds, to exhibit normal behaviour, to bathe, and have access to wholesome feed and clean fresh drinking water.

‘DAS standards are built on science and are regularly reviewed and amended where new research supports good practice in the industry.’
