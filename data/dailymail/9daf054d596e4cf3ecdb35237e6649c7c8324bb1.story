Web users have turned into detectives in the wake of the Boston Marathon tragedy, looking through hundreds of photos to find the person or group behind Monday's carnage.

As authorities conduct an exhaustive investigation of the moments leading up to the double bombing near the finish line, Reddit and 4chan users are doing one of their own - pointing out people at the site of the first bombing whom they think the FBI should be talking to.

There is, however, no official evidence to support that the individuals pictured had anything to do with the devastating twin bombing, which claimed three lives and injured 183 others. The claims are merely speculation, and not considered viable evidence in the Boston
and federal investigation.

Meanwhile, CNN reported that a suspect has been identified by police after two pieces of video evidence at the scene of the second blast were handed in to authorities.

Is this the suspect? People on Reddit have 
claimed that while everyone around him seems to instinctively cower, 
this man appears to sprint away in the opposite direction to everyone 
else caught in the blast

However, it is hard to see how the men identified by the Reddit users fit the description of the suspect leaked to other media outlets.

CNN's John King said sources told him it was a 'dark-skinned man' and CBS reported that it was a white man who was wearing a black jacket, a gray hooded sweatshirt and a white or off-white baseball cap backwards. He is said to be six feet or 6-feet-2-inches tall with a medium build.

Investigators have not named any suspects in the bombing, but have revealed that two pressure cooker bombs were stuffed inside black vinyl backpacks or duffel bags when they went off.

Using that information and numerous photos - mainly from the site of the first blast - users have pointed out several people either wearing black backpacks or otherwise individuals who could be thought to be acting strangely before the explosions.

The people are circled and their movements are documented by comparing several photographs in a subreddit called 'FINDBOSTONBOMBERS.'

The person who started the subreddit, who goes by the moniker Oops777, has been identified as a 23-year-old professional poker player who lives in Boston, according to reports.

The FBI's Boston office did not return a call from MailOnline for comment.

In one series of photos, one 
internet user marks a face the crowd two hours prior to the bombing, and
then his reaction afterward, noting that the man, wearing a white 
hooded sweatshirt, does not appear interested in the race and can be 
seen walking away calmly after the first blast.

While
some posts may be perceived as accusatory, other users are quick to 
warn that just because the person is pictured with a black bag, it 
doesn't mean they had anything to do with the bombing.

In another photo posted on both 4chan
and Reddit, a man wearing a blue coat is pictured near the scene of the second explosion holding a backpack - 
with distinctive black and grey straps.

Next to it is a photo of a mangled backpack from the crime scene, with straps that bear a striking resemblance.

Another man, wearing a green hat and wearing a black backpack, was also highlighted on Reddit as a person who could be involved.

The Boston Marathon was a public event, and hundreds of black backpacks were worn among the thousands of attendees.

But at the very least, it gives people a
glimpse of the excruciating job the FBI have in scouring through 
thousands of images in a situation where anyone can look like a suspect.

Yesterday, a preliminary probe by Boston officials revealed that they were made of two 1.6-gallon pressure cookers - one containing shards of metal and ball bearings and the other packed with nails - and both stuffed into black backpacks or duffel bags, according to a source close to the probe.

The method used to make the bomb is reminiscent of the failed attempt to bomb Times Square by Faisal Shahzad in 2010 - and other terror strikes in India, Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan.

The FBI and anti-terror officials have urged the public to turn in any photos or video footage they may have of the marathon that may have captured a suspect or suspects before the blasts.

Ben Levine, who works in public relations in an office on Boylston Street and was directly above where the first bomb exploded, responded to that call.

In a piece he wrote for Deadspin,
Mr Levine said that he was standing at his second floor office window 
and snapping pictures of the runners and crowds below when 'a bomb went 
off in my face.'

Investigators have circulated 
information about the bombs, which involved kitchen pressure cookers 
packed with explosives, nails and other lethal shrapnel – but the FBI 
says no on has claimed responsibility.

'Someone
knows who did this,' Richard DesLauriers, FBI agent in charge in 
Boston, said at a news conference where he detailed the type of clues a 
bomber might have left.

'Importantly, the person who did this is someone's friend, neighbor, co-worker or relative.'

Claims: As the FBI scours through thousands of photos of the moments before the Boston Marathon, various Reddit and 4chan users are pointing out who they believe to be possible suspects

Speculation: In this photo, the Redditors claim that a man can be seen dropping a suspicious object near the scene of the second explosion

New crime scene photographs of the remnants of the first bomb which detonated during Monday's Boston marathon shows that a six-liter pressure cooker was used in at least one of the deadly charges - as experts described the devices as military-style 'anti-personnel' devices.

The images - released by the Joint 
Terrorist Task Force - show the wreckage of a stainless steel pressure 
cooker with an Underwriters Laboratory safety mark and an imprint that 
reads gas or electric, with experts describing the devices as 
military-style 'anti-personnel' devices.

Furthermore, it is being claimed the 
deadly devices used were designed to act like 'homemade claymores' - 
powerful, directional anti-personnel devices.

The
lid of a pressure cooker was found on a nearby rooftop and 
investigators were able to pinpoint which type of cooker was used.

One brand of pressure cooker with '6L' on the bottom is made by the Spanish company Fagor, which sells about 50,000 of the six-liter pots in the United States every year, The New York Times reported.

This gives investigators a real chance to narrow down their list of suspects - which they said yesterday was 'wide open' - and find out who is responsible for the worst attacks on U.S. soil since 9/11.

They will use every clue, from the cooker's manufacturer and retailers to the types of nails used in the shrapnel, to try and find out from where the bomb parts were purchased and by whom.

Roy Parker, a retired Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives agent who ­developed the agency’s explosives training program, said examiners are looking at scraps of the bomb components, bags and all other forensic evidence.

He said: 'You’re looking for a needle in a haystack, but the needle is there. If you look long enough, you’ll get stuck with it. This is not an unsolvable crime.'
