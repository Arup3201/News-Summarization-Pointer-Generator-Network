Ed Miliband today publicly snubbed Gordon Brown after thanking every Labour MP who campaigned against Scottish independence – apart from the former Labour leader.

Mr Miliband made an impromptu speech at the Labour Party conference to hail the efforts of those who defeated Alex Salmond last week. 

He welcomed onto the stage in Manchester a host of MPs while heaping praise on Labour activists and trade unionists who campaigned for the ‘No’ to independence group. 

But Mr Miliband pointedly failed to mention the former Prime Minister, whose intervention has been credited with helping to shore up leaking support for the Union in the final weeks of the campaign.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown was credited with helping to get the 'No' to independence campaign back on track

It came after Mr Miliband yesterday shot down the suggestion of a return to the front bench for the former Prime Minister following his political come back during the referendum. 

Mr Brown was acknowledged by Margaret Curran, the shadow Scottish secretary, who said he had ‘electrified this campaign’.

Mr Brown intervened in the final week before polling day to bring together the main Westminster political leaders to sign a joint ‘vow’ promising new powers for Scotland.

Alex Salmond has since claimed that the No campaign’s last minute promise of more powers for Holyrood, orchestrated by Mr Brown, was crucial in winning the referendum for the ‘No’ campaign.

But Labour leader Mr Miliband refused to acknowledge his predecessor’s impact.

Speaking in Manchester this afternoon, he said he particularly wanted to thank ‘all of the people in the Scottish Labour party’ who helped defeat independence.

He praised Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont, her deputy Anas Sarwar and Better Together chairman Alistair Darling.

Mr Miliband also thanked shadow ministers Margaret Curran, Jim Murphy and Douglas Alexander – as well as the Scottish Labour party and the Scottish trade unionists in general.

Mr Darling, who led the Better Together Campaign, also spoke during the session to attack Mr Salmond for failing to accept the result of last week’s referendum.

He also accused defeated SNP leader Mr Salmond of having ‘lost the plot’ for claiming Scotland could declare independence without a referendum

It came after Mr Salmond claimed ‘a referendum is only one of a number of routes’ to independence.

Better Together chairman Alistair Darling was applauded for his efforts keeping the Union together at the Labour conference today - but Mr Brown was absent and unacknowledged

BBC presenter Andrew Marr performed an impression of Mr Brown during his interview with Ed Miliband yesterday. He asked the Labour leader if he would be prepared to give the former Prime Minster a job - but Mr Miliband said it was not on the cards

But addressing the Labour Party conference in Manchester, Mr Darling said: ‘Apparently, the First Minister of Scotland said today while he'd lost the referendum, never mind, he might be able to seize power some other way.’

He added: ‘I just say to Mr Alex Salmond - you lost the argument, you lost the referendum, you've lost office, and now you've lost the plot. The people of Scotland are sovereign and the people of Scotland have said ‘no thanks’ to separation and you must accept that result.’

Mr Salmond has accused David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband of reneging on their word to hand Scotland more powers.

Mr Salmond said despite last week’s referendum defeat the ‘writing is on the wall’ for the Union. Mr Salmond said: ‘I think the destination is pretty certain, we are only now debating the timescale and the method.’

Interviewed on Sky News, Mr Salmond said: ‘There are a whole range of ways Scotland can improve its position in pursuit of Scottish independence.’

He added: ‘I think referendums are great, they have been my policy and even I have been surprised by an 85 per cent poll and the degree of public engagement, but of course for many years there was a ‘gradualist’ attitude to independence.

‘That is to say you establish a parliament, you establish successfully more powers until you have a situation where you’re independent in all but name and then presumably you declare yourself to be independent. Many countries have proceeded through that route.

‘There is a parliamentary route where people can make their voice heard as well - so a referendum is only one of a number of routes.

‘I think it’s the best route incidentally, that’s always been my opinion but my opinion is only one of many.’
