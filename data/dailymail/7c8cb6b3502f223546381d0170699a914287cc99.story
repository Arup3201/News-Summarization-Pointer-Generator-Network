It's widely accepted that the best way to combat spam messages is a spam-filter program.

However, one student from Murdoch University in Perth has decided to take his spamming problem into his own hands, and hit the spammer directly.

After responding to a series of texting 'pyramid' spam messages on his mobile, Aaron Tan, 27, uploaded the conversation onto his Facebook account.

The images has received nearly 4000 shares, as well as being posted on popular humour sites like Tickld.com.

Aaron Tan, a 27-year-old student from Murdoch University in Perth, responded to spam texts on his mobile phone with a series of hilarious messages

Mr Tan says he was receiving the texts on a regular basis for between three and five days. 'I decided if he didn't stop, I would give him a taste of his own medicine'

'I was receiving these texts on a regular basis for about 3-5 days,' says Aaron Tan, a 27-year-old student from Murdoch University in Perth.

'I decided if he didn't stop, I would give him a taste of his own medicine.'

Tan says he knew the messages were not coming from an automated-machine.

'The timing between each message made it quite apparent that this wasn't an automated service. I also noted that the number that was texting me was a 04 number, which meant it was coming from a cellphone '

'I have had spam advertisements before, but this is the first time I've actually decided to reply in kind.' 

Tan says his cultural background helped him grow seasoned in the art of internet trolling.

'When I used to live in Singapore, trolling was something I would do whenever got the chance. In a way, it's a form of personal justice.'

He says that while he has received spam messages before, this was the first time he had decided to 'reply in kind' 

Tan says internet trolling is worthwhile because 'you never know when a random or funny image might make someone else's day'

Since he uploaded the conversation on his Facebook account, the conversation has been shared 4000 times and posted on popular humour sites like Tickld.com

The first step of joining the trolling trade is staying equipped with a vast arsenal of ammunition.

'I keep a collection of random images on hand at all times. When I'm on my phone and I see something funny or random, I always save it.

'I mean, you never know when a random or funny image might make someone else's day.

'I think people should do what they need to do to inject a little spice in their lives. After all, life is tough enough as it is, why not make it interesting. 

Tan says he hopes 'Harris', who spammed him in the original messages,  doesn't take things to heart.

'I'm a little concerned, but I'm sure even he could appreciate the humour in the situation. And even if he doesn't, my answer to him would be a simple "Hey man, you spam me, I spam you back. We're even."'

Mr Tan says he hopes the spammer doesn't take things to heart, and hopes he 'can appreciate the humour in the situation'
