A three-year-old girl who has spent her entire life in hospital as a result of a rare condition which means she cannot breathe on her own is preparing to go home for the first time

Maisie Harris suffers from Ondine’s Curse which means her brain forgets to tell her to breathe, a condition which previously made it impossible for her to leave Great Ormond Street Hospital.

However, thanks to a new portable ventilator, Maisie will be able to leave the hospital and go home to her family in Gillingham, Kent.

Little Miss Sunshine: Maisie Harris, pictured with her parents Rachel Bridger, 23, and Andrew Harris, 26, is set to go home for the first time on Monday after spending all her life in hospital

The
Minnie Mouse fan requires 24-hour ventilator treatment for the rare 
condition, which is medically know as congenital central hypoventilation
syndrome (CCHS), which sees her brain fail to send the vital messages 
to her lungs and muscles to tell her to breathe.

Her
brain fails to send the correct messages telling her to breathe but 
Maisie also suffers from malacia of the airways - ‘floppy’ airways that 
do not hold their shape properly.

Now,
Maisie, who also suffers from malacia of the airways, can look forward 
to a future outside of Great Ormond Street and hopefully be able to go 
to a normal school in the future.

GOSH 
staff held a going-home party on Miffy Ward yesterday to celebrate the 
little girl’s bravery as Maisie, who celebrates her third birthday this month, gets ready to move out on Monday.

Her mother Rachel 
Bridger, 23, said: ‘We cannot wait to bring Maisie home and enjoy being a
normal family. It’s felt as though we have been in hospital for a 
lifetime.

Happy ending: After spending all her life at Great Ormond Street Hospital, staff threw Maisie a leaving party to celebrate her new portable ventilator and to say goodbye

Normal life: Maisie has never played with other children and her parents hope that she will be able to make new friends as she joins a local nursery int heir home town of Gillingham, Kent

‘Everyone here has become like a second family to us - they know Maisie inside out.

‘She
knows her own mind but she is a really happy little girl. She’s hardly 
ever upset. I don’t think it will take her long to get used to playing 
with her toys at home and sleeping in her own bed for the first time.

‘Our
friends and family have helped us decorate the house and get it ready 
for her. We’ve painted her bedroom cream and we have got some lovely 
stick-on stencils for the walls.’

The
new ventilator is intelligent enough to know when she is able to take 
her own breaths and when she is likely to have a CCHS episode and 
require ventilation.

Ms 
Bridger, who suffers from a less complex form of CCHS, and Maisie’s 
father Andrew Harris, 26, have been fully trained on how to use her 
ventilator and will be supported by a team of local carers.

The
couple have mostly been living in hospital accommodation ever since 
Maisie was transferred to GOSH from Medway Maritime Hospital when she 
was three months old.

They have taken it in turns to make the hour-and-a-half journey back to their home.

As
a result of her condition Maisie, who loves Minnie Mouse and playing 
Alphablocks on her father’s iPad, has hardly spent any time with other 
children.

Her parents now hope she will be able to mix with other youngsters at nursery.

Family curse: Maisie's mother Rachel suffers from a less complex form of the condition which has blighted her daughter's life

Mr Harris said: ‘She will have to get used to lots of new faces as she only really sees close family and her nurses.

‘Hopefully she will soon learn to share her toys and play with other children.’

Dr
Colin Wallis, a consultant in respiratory paediatrics at GOSH, is 
working with a number of children requiring long-term ventilation, 
including Maisie, to allow them to spend more time at home with their 
families.

He also treated Ms Bridger when she was younger.

He
said: ‘Maisie’s situation is quite complex because she has a 
combination of different respiratory conditions, but we are hopeful this
new technology will allow her to go home, be with her family and start 
enjoying a fuller, more normal life.

‘We
have been working on ways to allow a greater number of long-term 
ventilated children to go home - not only because it greatly enhances 
their quality of life, but also because it’s much better for their 
development.

‘The family 
home is the best place for a young child to grow and develop, and Maisie
will now be able to go out and about with her family, make new friends 
and experience everything the outside world has to offer.’

Dr Wallis said CCHS can run in families but added: ‘It is incredibly unusual to see two generations affected by it like this.

‘Maisie’s
condition is more severe than her mother’s and is also complicated by 
the additional problem of malacia of the airways.’
