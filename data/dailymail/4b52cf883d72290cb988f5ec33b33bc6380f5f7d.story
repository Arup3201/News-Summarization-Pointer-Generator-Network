Former Manchester United chief executive David Gill is to play a bigger part than expected in the hunt for a manager to replace the axed David Moyes.

Gill, whose decision to step down as United CEO around the time that Sir Alex Ferguson retired did the club no favours, has purposely given his successor Ed Woodward space and played no role in the last two transfer windows, despite remaining on the football club board.

But Gill, who still represents United at Premier League meetings with Woodward, will be one of those closely consulted in the selection process.

Leading the search: Man Utd Chief Executive Ed Woodward will head up the hunt for Moyes' successor

The search is being led by  Woodward, rather than the owning Glazer family, and the executive vice-chairman recognises that Gill’s extensive football knowledge has to be utilised, despite previous perceived tensions between them.

United have mentioned carrying out due diligence on all candidates for the post. But that will be done internally rather than by bringing in headhunters.

There may be rioting in Rio and warnings from Brazil midfielder Fernandinho of team buses being pelted with stones but England are confident enough about FIFA arrangements for the World Cup to include only four security personnel in their party.

The prestigious Footballer of the Year award decided by football writers looks like going to prolific Liverpool scorer Luis Suarez or his talismanic captain Steven Gerrard.

But unfortunately neither might be in the country to collect the trophy at the gala dinner on May 15, when Suarez is likely to be back in his native Uruguay and Gerrard will  be on a much-needed holiday before the  World Cup.

The only previous occasions when the 
footballer of the year , the most important individual award in the 
game, hasn’t been feted in person were when Arsenal’s Robert Pires was 
having knee surgery and Liverpool’s Terry McDermott was at a racecourse.

Not on our telly, Moyes

Axed Manchester United manager David Moyes was loosely sounded out by both BBC and ITV about being a World Cup pundit earlier in the season. But Moyes was concerned at the reaction of fans, with United having such a torrid time, about being seen working on TV when the transfer window had opened.

However, now Moyes no longer has the cachet of being Old Trafford boss, the TV offers might not be so forthcoming. BBC, who have Moyes’s arch critic Rio Ferdinand in their line-up as well as his former assistant coach Phil Neville, have no plans to add the ex-United boss to their team and ITV say it is unlikely they will.

FA chairman Greg Dyke seems unperturbed about upsetting the Premier League by unveiling his England Commission findings during the last week of their season. The proposals will be outlined to an FA board meeting on May 7, four days before the final fixtures.

Meanwhile, UEFA have started to contact clubs who have breached their financial fair play regulations, so Manchester City can expect a call any time soon.

The latest FA financial figures don’t augur well for their huge task of persuading their 17,000 corporate seat-holders, who bankroll the Wembley business plan, to renew long-term deals, most of which expire in 2017.

There has been a £2million fall in Club Wembley revenue from a decline in available  box sales. Wembley chief executive Roger Maslin blames the recession and is confident that sales will pick up.

They have done so on the boxing front, with all seats and boxes sold for the George Groves v Carl Froch rematch on May 31, which will be watched by an 80,000 capacity crowd.

Sky Sports are understood to have agreed with a surprisingly conciliatory BT Sport that neither of the networks should put out a press release announcing the pick selection for the European Rugby Champions Cup.

That non-disclosure pact suited Sky a lot more as it prevented BT from trumpeting that they have picks 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 of English clubs in the group stages, leaving Sky with 4 and 6.
