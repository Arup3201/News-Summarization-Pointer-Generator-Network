Wayne Hitchcock threatened to blow up a block of flats but was stopped when the gas meter ran out of credit

Three men who threatened to blow up a block of flats were stopped thanks to a gas meter running out of credit. 

Police surrounded the block in Chaddesden, Derby, after drunken knifemen Wayne Hitchcock, Joseph Smith and Joseph Kilmartin took over one of the flats in the building.

When police cordoned off the scene, Hitchcock and Smith went on a wrecking spree even ripping out a toilet and throwing it through a window along with parts of a settee and cupboards.

They also ripped out a cooker which led to gas escaping before shouting 'we're going to blow this place up, we've turned the gas on'.

Luckily, the gas meter had ran out credit and the pipe was damaged as the cooker was pulled out preventing the flat from being blown up. 

Jailing the three men for a total of seven years, Judge John Gosling said it was 'one of the worst' cases of public disorder he had dealt with in 30 years.

One police officer described the incident as the 'most terrifying' experience in his nine years of service.

Detective Constable Sean Grainger, investigating officer in the case, said: 'It was like there had been an explosion in the flat.

'These men destroyed the victim's life. They smashed everything in the flat and even threw the toilet out of the window.

'They broke all his worldly possessions, even items of sentimental value that are irreplaceable.'They were arrested after a one-and-a-half-hour stand-off with police.

'Some of the group were supposed to be friends with the victim but no real friend would ever cause a person so much hurt.'

Kilmartin, who lived in the block, had been trusted to keep a key to the victim's home by a neighbour.

At 3.30am on May 20 Kilmartin let himself and his two friends, Hitchcock and Smith, into the flat.

Officers were called to the block and discovered that a panel of the flat door had been damaged. 

'They were drunk and aggressive and were all jeering and bouncing off each other,' said Mr Coupland.

'Smith was making gun motions with his fingers.'

The police called for more officers and as they moved in to arrest the men, Hitchcock said 'come on, let's have it', and Smith screamed at officers to 'back off'.

Hitchcock then threw a plant pot towards the police who had to spray CS gas to escape.

Outside, officers looked on as items were thrown from the window.

Smith, 20, and Hitchcock, 29, both from Chaddesden, admitted affray and criminal damage and were jailed for two years.

Hitchcock was also convicted of another offence, racially aggravated threatening behaviour, and jailed for an extra five months.

Kilmartin, 29, from Chaddesden, was convicted by a jury of affray and was jailed for three years.

The flat tenant, who had been out at the time, told police that before the incident he had considered the three men to be friends and they had 'taken everything' from him because he had no home insurance.

Derby Homes said they had found him another property and had repaired the flat at a cost of £1,500.
