Hillary Clinton is set to set up camp in a luxury Hamptons home with husband Bill and plot her moves for a widely-expected run for the Presidency in 2016.

She will step down as Secretary of State after the President's inauguration in January, and aides have revealed how she will retreat to the New York seaside famous for its wealthy residents.

Mrs Clinton is also set to discuss whether or not she will run for president in 2016.

Mrs Clinton got an unexpected endorsement from former Republican speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who said that his party has no one that could match her if she does step up for the nomination.

Weighing her options: Hillary Clinton is likely to command hefty fees on the speaker circuit after she leaves her post as Secretary of State, though it is unclear if she will run for president again in 2016

'If their competitor in 2016 is Hillary Clinton, supported by Bill Clinton and presumably a still relatively popular President Barack Obama, trying to win that will be the Super Bowl. And the Republican party today is incapable of competing at that level,' he said during an appearance on Meet The Press.

The compliment is particularly surprising considering that Gingrich and Bill Clinton famously sparred when they were rivals in the 1990s, and Gingrich was the one to push for the investigation of the then-President's affair with intern Monica Lewinsky.

'First of all, she's very formidable as a person. She's a very competent person. She's married to the most popular Democrat in the country; they both think (it) would be good for her to be president. It makes it virtually impossible to stop her for the nomination,' he said.

His prediction is backed up by numbers, as a recent Washington Post poll reports that 57 per cent of Americans would support a Hillary Clinton campaign.

According to multiple reports, Mrs Clinton has echoed her denials of plans to run for office in both private and public, but that doesn't mean that she can just go ahead and truly let loose in her new-found state of unemployment.

With any and all positions that she decides to take, she will have to weigh the optics of if it would look appropriate for a presidential candidate.

That said, another concern is shoring up a steady income, because it doesn't come cheap to live like the Clintons.

The good life: The Clintons have been frequent visitors to the Hamptons in the summer, seen here this past August, though it is now thought that they may be buying a place there

Longtime fans: President Clinton (seen here in 1999) has previously rented homes and stayed with some of their famous friends- like Kate Capshaw and Stephen Spielberg

The New York Times
reports that one of her first moves out of office would be to look into
buying a home in the Hamptons, as she and former President Bill have 
frequently vacationed in the tony beach getaway.

A
home befitting two of the country's biggest political heavyweights 
would easily run in the multi-million dollar range, any the couple are 
known to enjoy the benefits of a lifestyle that allows private jet use.

Much of her hesitation in deciding about 2016 comes from the failed bid in 2008, and it comes as little surprise that those mistakes are also influencing her financial decisions.

As recently as September 30 of this year, Hillary still has $73,000 remaining of her campaign debt. Politico reported that her husband sent out multiple emails to supporters in hopes of earning back some of that money to have that number decreased- if not deleted- by this month.

Aides to Mrs Clinton say a continued working partnership between she and Bill is one of the likely steps after she takes some immediate time off from her taxing travel schedule following her leave of office.

The Clinton Foundation, which has occupied much of the former President's time since he left the White House, is seen as an ideal place for Hillary to ease her way back into public life and find a way to work on causes closest to her.

Fighting for women's rights has always been at the top of her agenda, and it is considered a given that she will be working for that cause in some form for the rest of her career.

Time together: Aides think that Hillary will spend some time working with her husband's foundation as she finds her footing outside of the constraints of formal political office for the first time in decades

Who knows: She reportedly thinks that one of her biggest mistakes in her last presidential bid was announcing too early, so if she goes for it again, she likely won't say so publicly until mid-2015

Speaking engagements and a new book about her time as Secretary of State are two other options for the ways to fill the time- and her bank accounts- but the frankness of those potential opportunities will be limited if she does eventually decide to run for president again.

If her words are being seen as keys to a possible political agenda, as opposed to candid reflections on her time as the American emissary abroad, she will be forced to leave the candor for private conversations.

Realistically though, such a decision will not come for some time, as she has told insiders that one of the biggest mistakes she made in her last campaign was announcing her candidacy too early, effectively making the race longer and less manageable.

That time, she announced two years before the election, so if she heeds her own advice, that means that she likely will not publicly discuss the option until mid-2015.

For now, however, she continues to keep all of her options open- and decidedly vague.

'Iâ€™m frankly looking forward to returning to living a life that enjoys a lot of simple pleasures and gives me time for family and friends and other pursuits,' she said during her latest trip to Ireland.
