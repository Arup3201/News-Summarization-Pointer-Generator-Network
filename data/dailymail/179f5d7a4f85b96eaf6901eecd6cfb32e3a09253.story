Christoph Kramer was given his first-ever competitive start for Germany in the World Cup final but the desperately unlucky defensive midfielder had to be taken off after 31 minutes with a head injury.

The 23-year-old's full debut was cut short after he violently clashed his head with Argentina centre-back Ezequiel Garay's shoulder 17 minutes in, leaving him requiring treatment.

Kramer looked disorientated as he was taken off for Andre Schurrle after playing on for nearly 15 minutes and arguably should have been substituted earlier by Germany manager Joachim Low.

It was unfortunate for Kramer, who was only given his first start for Germany after Real Madrid star Sami Khedira was ruled out with a calf injury in the warm up.

Kramer's injury came via Garay as the pair challenged for a bouncing ball on the edge of the penalty area.

The Borussia Monchengladbach loan player was visibly dazed from the blow and continued to look so as he was substituted.

Kramer wasn't selected as part of Low's provisional squad for the World Cup at the beginning of May, but was included as a back up to the likes of Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger.

In the thick of it: Kramer tackles Javier Mascherano during the World Cup final before being substituted

In the space of just a couple of hours, German midfielder Christoph Kramer has endured the full range of emotions, enjoying a stroke of huge personal fortune, as Sami Khedira's niggle in the warm-up to the World Cup final against Argentina handed him a first competitive start on the grandest stage.

Then, however, he suffered a cruel twist of fate, as a nasty head collision saw him exit the match after just half-an-hour.

Here, Sportsmail provides all you need to know about the unfortunate Kramer....

So tell me a little bit about Christoph Kramer, the poor German who headed off the pitch just half-an-hour into the World Cup Final...

The German central midfielder is 23 years old and enjoyed a breakthrough season in the Bundesliga on loan at Borussia Monchengladbach, as his side finished sixth in the top flight.

He emerged through the youth team at Bayer Leverkusen, where he will return to next season, and is recognised as one of the standout talents in Germany after a previous impressive loan spell in the second division with Bochum.

What kind of player is he?

An indefatigable midfielder, who works relentlessly in the central positions for his team. He does much of the unseen work and he is not dissimilar in style to Sami Khedira, who he replaced after the warm up in the World Cup final.

So has he been a fixture in the Germany national squad?

No, Kramer wasn't even picked in Joachim Low's first provisional squad for the World Cup at the beginning of May.

However, the coach soon decided that he required extra midfield bodies as players such as Sami Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger recovered from injury, while Ilkay Gundogan had already been ruled out.

Kramer replaced forward Andre Hahn in the squad and then impressed in training to such an extent that he was included in the 23-man pool for Brazil.

Has he been called into action at the World Cup?

He has barely featured, appearing only as a substitute in the 89th minute against both Algeria and France. The World Cup final on Sunday evening marked his first competitive start for Die Mannschaft.

That seems like a brutal induction...?

Well, it wasn't planned that way. Khedira pulled up in the warm up and Low handed Kramer the nod. Sadly, though, it was destined to be a short-lived experience.

How was he injured?

Argentine defender Ezequiel Garay crashed into Kramer as the two challenged a bouncing ball on the edge of the penalty area. It was a really heavy collision and Kramer looked visibly disorientated and was then replaced after just 30 minutes. At 23, we're sure that he will be back for more in future major tournaments.
