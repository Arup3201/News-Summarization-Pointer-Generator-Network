Ex-Liverpool defender Daniel Agger and his family have been left ‘heartbroken’ after their pet dog was killed during a trip to a dog salon, his wife has revealed.

Sofie Agger posted a photograph of Charlie the dog on Instagram, saying that he ‘went to the groomer and never came home again’. 

She said workers at the salon, which has not been named, put him in ‘some dryer box’ last week and it was unclear whether the machine was faulty or the animal was simply forgotten about.

The footballer’s wife, whom he married in 2010, said of Charlie on December 6: ‘We lost him today and our family are totally heartbroken. He went to the groomer and never came home again.

‘They put him in some dryer box and we still don’t know if they forgot him or the machine had a fault. Are such in shock and still can grasp that our dog had pain like that and then died [sic].

‘Dearly hope anyone who has a machine like that stop using them. Know it’s a long shot but as I said we’re heartbroken. We will miss you Charlie.’

Agger left Liverpool in the summer after making 232 appearances for the club during eight years at Anfield.

The 30-year-old centre back returned to his native Denmark to play for Brondby - the club from which he signed for the Reds.

Agger, 30, joined Liverpool in 2006 from Danish Superliga team Brondby before returning there last summer

Upon his return to Denmark, he said: 'I would like to thank the Liverpool supporters for the incredible backing they have given me in my time here and the warmth and generosity of spirit displayed to my family.'

The defender - who won the League Cup in 2012 with Liverpool - is also captain of the Danish national team, for whom he has played 66 times and scored 12 goals.
