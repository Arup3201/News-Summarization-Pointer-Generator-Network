The unstoppable idiot has struck again. There is always a degree of fruitlessness when writing about Michel Platini’s ideas. They are always bad, always to the detriment of football, invariably self-preserving, yet for some reason irresistible.

Platini, president of UEFA, is like a monster from a horror film, marching inexorably towards his victims. Nothing can stop him. Not bullets, not fire, not all the weaponry available to mankind; and too few in positions of influence are moved to oppose anyway.

His latest plan, arguably his worst yet, was passed unanimously by UEFA’s member nations. The Football Association, the Germans, Dutch, Spanish, French, Italians, countries one might think could be trusted with the future of the international game, all acquiesced, meekly.

Idiot on board! Michel Platini's newfangled plans are to the severe detriment of  international football

Crazy idea: UEFA are to implement plans for a Nations League to act as further qualification for Euro 2020

Unbelievable! The changes mean tiny nations like Gibraltar will have a genuine opportunity of qualifying

So, on he goes, lumbering, lurching from side to side, laying waste whatever is in his wake: the European Championship, the UEFA Cup, some of the finest, most competitive leagues in club football. 

Gone, all gone. Platini sees himself as the game’s great thinker and reformer. He isn’t. He is to football what myxomatosis was to Watership Down; what Dutch elm disease is to Dutch elms.

He is the master of misrule, the creator of  mismatches and instigator of tedium, the man who put the World Cup in Qatar and a medal around the neck of Peter Kenyon at the Champions League final.

It is hard to think of a more negative influence on the sport in the last 50 years. He inherited competitions that were the pinnacle of football expression, and has ruined them.

Platini killed the greatest international football tournament in the world when he increased participation in the European Championship finals from 16 countries to 24. There are 54 member nations of UEFA, meaning it is now almost as hard to get knocked out of the qualification process as it is to go through. With as many as three teams progressing from some groups once the play-offs have taken place, the qualifying stage is dull beyond comprehension.

UEFA took over the television rights but — as was predicted the moment the idea was floated — interest in these dead rubbers has flat-lined. Platini (right) has two choices. Admit the scheme was a terrible mistake and abandon it; or plough ahead, piling one bad idea on to another in a desperate bid to shore up interest, and add votes to his next election campaign. No prizes for guessing where this is heading.

So here it is. The Nations League. A European Championship within a European Championship, converting friendly football into a mini-league pooled on ability with a sequence of fixtures too complex to consider. All you need to know for now is the bottom line. The winners of each of four divisions will get a wildcard entry to the 2020 European Championship finals.

Asking for trouble: The UEFA president's plans are becoming increasingly more bizarre

Delight: Spain won Euro 2012 and will be favourites for the competition in two years' time in France

Strange move: Holland were among the nations to pass Platini's latest plans to overhaul the game

No worries: The Football Association didn't have a problem voting yes in line with other member nations

As the top groups are made up of the likes of Spain, Germany, Holland and Italy, one presumes that is not such a carrot. The major nations will be fairly confident of qualifying via the conventional route, considering all they have to do is finish top two, or maybe three, in a six-team group. Their friendly games will remain little more than, well, friendlies.

For the rest, however, it is a lifeline. Another means of remaining ordinary and inadequate and yet still getting a place at the big boys’ table. Each division winner will claim a place, including the bottom one.

Now guess who is going to the European Championship finals? Based on current co-efficient rankings, one of the following: Estonia, Georgia, Lithuania, Moldova, Latvia, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Kazakhstan, Malta, Liechtenstein, the Faroe Islands, Andorra, San Marino and Gibraltar. (That’s 14 votes the next time Platini seeks re-election, by the way. The man who brought the big one to Liechtenstein. What’s not to like?)

The most recent qualification campaign, for the 2014 World Cup, saw all of those nations in action bar Gibraltar. In total they played 128 games and recorded 13 wins, eight of which involved games against each other.

Only Malta’s victory in Armenia, Moldova’s in Montenegro, Cyprus’s win at home to Iceland, Luxembourg’s against Northern Ireland and Georgia’s victory over Belarus were against teams that are not in that dismal last division. The goal difference for the 14 countries was minus 235. And one of them will be going to the 2020 European Championship finals.

To think that the tournament used to be 
about excellence. To think that what we loved about it was that there 
were no gentle looseners, no weak opponents and no chance to play your 
way in; hit the ground running, or you were out. At the 2012 tournament,
 the Czech Republic, Holland, Denmark, Republic of Ireland and Sweden 
all lost first time out. Only the Czechs recovered to make it through. 
Just a single defeat was also enough to eliminate Russia, Poland and 
Croatia.

Up there with the best: England are likely to face Europe's top teams in the different format

No problem though? Even if England were to struggle, they'd still be able to qualify in the traditional way

Living in a different world? The changes are said to offer more competitive football instead of friendlies

Are you laughing at me? Platini's plans have been widely derided by the footballing community

Now 16 of 24 qualifiers will reach the final knockout stage and at least one match will involve a meeting with a team from Europe’s bottom 14. How can UEFA have allowed their marquee international competition to be skewed in this way? How have the national associations supported it? All they see is the money.

The FA would not have looked beyond those lucrative friendlies at Wembley against Europe’s giants. Other countries do not attract significant crowds to non-competitive fixtures, and are desperate to find a means of making them interesting. They also buy into Platini’s guff that this gives friendly football credibility.

In 2012, questioned on the expansion of the European Championship from 
16 to 24 teams, Martin Kallen, UEFA’s chief executive for the 2012 
edition, reeled off a list of names of great teams that were unable to 
qualify under the old format.

This included Lithuania, who had 
somehow contrived to lose to Liechtenstein in the qualifying campaign. 
Lithuania are currently ranked 105th in the world, which makes them 
pretty lousy, but also near the top of UEFA pool four, which runs from 
92nd-ranked Estonia to San Marino in 207th place (Gibraltar have no 
ranking as yet). Lithuania would have a reasonable opportunity of 
progressing under the 24-team format, rising to a very good chance once 
the wildcard entry becomes active.

A year ago, however, when I 
questioned Platini on Kallen’s words he seemed unimpressed. ‘Why 
Lithuania will qualify?’ he asked. I explained. I added that Kallen 
counted Lithuania among the great teams who were missing out. ‘Martin 
Kallen don’t know nothing about football,’ Platini pouted. Indeed not; 
and he would appear to be in good company on that.

Huge boost: Lithuania, ranked 105th in the world, will see their chances of progression rocket

UEFA’S new Nations League starts in 2018 and will pave the way for some of the world’s lowest-ranked sides to play at the Euro 2020 finals.

HOW WILL IT WORK?

The plan is for UEFA’S 54 member teams to be put into four divisions, each containing 12-14 teams. The top-ranked sides will be in Division A and the lowest in Division D. Each division will then be split into four pools of three or four teams. Matches will be played between September and November 2018.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

The winners of the individual pools will then go into their division’s semi-finals and then a final in June 2019. Winners of those finals will qualify for Euro 2020. Based on current world rankings, England would be in Division A with the likes of Spain, Germany and Italy. But Division D, which would get one qualifying place for Euro 2020, contains some of the world’s worst teams. Gibraltar are not a FIFA member and so currently have no world ranking.

WHAT ABOUT REGULAR QUALIFICATION?

The remaining 20 places for Euro 2020 will be decided via the usual qualifying groups in 2019. If teams qualify both ways, places will go to the team below them in their Nations League division.

THE DIVISION D TEAMS (world ranking in brackets)

Estonia (92), Georgia (99), Lithuania (105), Moldova (108), Latvia (113), Luxembourg (120), Cyprus (122), Kazakhstan (127), Malta (134), Liechtenstein (151), Faroe Islands (162), Andorra (199), San Marino (207), Gibraltar (N/A)
