Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen believes he has come of age as Wales prepare for what could be the defining moment of their Euro 2016 campaign.

Allen does not grab too many headlines, with the likes of Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey for international company, but there's no denying the effective role he plays in Chris Coleman's side.

The 25-year-old's game is to break up attacks and get his team moving forward, and it is a role which has gradually won over Reds fans after what he admits was a tricky start to Anfield life following his £15million transfer from Swansea in 2012.

'I look back to my first season at Liverpool and I was disappointed with the way I approached it at times,' Allen said.

'But the last couple of seasons I have certainly learned a lot and improved from that point of view and having those experiences.

'I understand now I have experienced a lot of highs in my career but unfortunately there are times when you will have some lows.

'My dip in form affected my confidence and it was the first time I had experienced that at club level.

'At Swansea it had always been progress really so it was a bit of a setback, but I came through it.

As well as holding down a regular place in the Liverpool team in recent months, Allen sees himself as a mainstay of a Wales side which has started the European Championship qualifiers so impressively.

Wales remain unbeaten after four games with an eight-point haul, but they face a serious examination of their qualification credentials against an Israel side top of the group with an unblemished 100 per cent record,

'I have turned 25 now so I don't consider myself a young player any more,' Allen said ahead of Wales' trip to what is expected to be a hostile Sammy Ofer Stadium in Haifa on Saturday night.

'I have got enough experience both at club and international level to feel a big part of the squad.

'The experience I have had in the past will hold me in good stead going forward in international football.

'I am getting towards my peak and I hope to keep improving in the next few years and getting better.'

The Wales midfielder admits that he found it difficult during his first season at Liverpool

Wales have not been in such a promising position to end their long wait for a major tournament finals appearance since going close to earning a place at Euro 2004.

On that occasion Wales lost a play-off to Russia and Allen, then a 13-year-old schoolboy, admits the disappointment of that near-miss resonates with a lot of the current squad.

'I was at the Russia game as my school used to go to the Millennium Stadium,' Allen said.

'I remember the disappointment of that night coming so close as do a lot of the lads. It is extra motivation for us.

'For youngsters and supporters to have experienced that we want to be the group to get there.

'We feel we are getting back to that level, we have quality and much more strength in depth than we have had in the past.'
