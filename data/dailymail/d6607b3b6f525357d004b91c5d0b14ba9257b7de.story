Dundee United chairman Stephen Thompson confirmed the club have launched disciplinary proceedings against players Paul Paton and Mark Wilson — as enquiries continue into an alleged assault on Celtic goalkeeper Lukasz Zaluska.

The pair have been axed from the squad to face Inverness on Saturday — and part of the club’s investigation will focus on whether they broke United’s code of conduct by being out 24 hours before an Under-20s fixture in which over-age players can feature.

Zaluska, 32, was involved in an altercation in Glasgow’s Ashton Lane in the early hours of Monday morning after which he required hospital treatment.

On Wednesday, United announced they were launching an internal probe into the conduct of two of their players ‘following information received by the club’. They revealed that neither player would be travelling with the squad to the Highlands. The pair did not attend training and will not return until disciplinary proceedings are completed next week.

Thompson said Paton, 27, and Wilson, 30, would receive a fair hearing but insisted the reputation of the Tannadice club was paramount.

‘We’ve opened disciplinary proceedings against two players and will conduct the matter in private,’ he said. ‘We will sit down with the individuals concerned and ask them their version of events and decide if there’s been a breach of the club’s rules or employment law.

‘Who would be a football chairman? It’s part and parcel (of football) but it’s not funny and it will be dealt with privately.

‘We expect to hold them (disciplinary proceedings) at the start of next week and go from there.

‘I won’t prejudge anything but I take everything seriously at the club. The image of the club is very important, how supporters look at things and young kids, too. They look up to people in football and that’s very important.

‘I am not actually involved in the process because I am the final course of appeal. But everyone will get a fair hearing.’

Speaking earlier, manager Jackie McNamara said: ‘I think it’s best to keep them out of the limelight, with the attention surrounding it. We’re doing an internal investigation that will not be done by me, it’ll be by the club. It’s more of a disruption if they’re here at the moment.

‘My focus is Saturday because to me that’s what we’re here for, to play games of football.

‘We’ll try to focus the best we can. It will take as long as it takes. It’s outwith my hands — the club is dealing with it.’

Asked directly if the investigation was related to Zaluska, McNamara added: ‘I don’t want to comment on that. We’ve put a statement out and everything will come out in due course.’

Wilson issued a statement on Wednesday admitting he had tried to ‘calm a matter down’ involving the Pole.

A spokesman for the former Scotland defender said: ‘There has been a lot of publicity surrounding events on Sunday night in Ashton Lane. Mark Wilson would like to clarify matters regarding himself.

‘Mark was out for a meal with his wife and some other couples. On his way home with his wife, they came across his friend and former team-mate Lukasz Zaluska. Mark tried to calm a matter down and latterly to help Lukasz as he was in a distressed situation.’

An SFA spokesman said the incident was currently a matter for the police and there will be no governing body investigation or disciplinary proceedings at this stage.
