Colonel Gaddafi's death has raised the question of what will happen to the missing billions he siphoned off and deposited around the world.

The fallen dictator is believed to have had around $168 billion in assets abroad, most of which has been frozen since the start of the year.

The stash includes a complex web of investment funds and a string of luxury properties.

However, uncovering the financial trail will prove difficult and the cash has been invested under false names, holding companies and secret accounts.

About $19 billion in assets believed to have been under the control of Gaddafi or associates have been located and frozen by the United Nations and member countries, U.S. officials have said since rebel forces began fighting to oust him from power.   

But other estimates suggest Gaddafi controlled as much as $30 billion in assets in the United States alone, plus large holdings in Europe and South Africa, said Victor Comras, a former money laundering expert for the United Nations and U.S. State Department.   

'Gaddafi was no dummy,' Comras said. 'The obvious and easy money, that held in Western banks and financial institutions, has largely already been located and blocked.'

Like other despots such as Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Democratic Republic of Congo's Mobutu Sese Seko, Gaddafi ' is likely to have also squirreled away large sums in assumed names or secret numbered accounts, or lockbox/deposit box stashes of currency, precious metals and marketable art and collectibles,' said Comras.   

Other assets could include indirect 
holdings of shares and stakes in businesses and property held under 
assumed names or controlled by trusted associates.   

'Finding this money will require very advanced financial forensics and it will still be quite difficult to locate,' Comras said.

Recovery
could ironically be aided by the fact that Gaddafi and his family 
regarded the Libyan state's wealth and assets as their own, said Roger 
Tamraz, a Dubai-based financier who has had extensive dealings with 
Libya.   

Seeing 
Libyan state wealth as their own, they kept most money or assets they 
held overseas in sovereign entities such as the Libyan Investment Fund, 
which would be easier for Gaddafi's successors to recover than assets 
converted to personal use and then concealed, he said. 

'When they were running the show, (the Gaddafis) didn't feel they had (to distinguish) between what was government (wealth) and what was private,' Tamraz said.   

Yet the NTC is moving cautiously in its efforts to recover overseas assets due to the fragility of the Libyan banking system, European and U.S. officials said.   

Before they can haul in any assets, experts and officials said, the new authorities in Tripoli will have to establish government procedures and mechanisms for efficiently and accountably handling large amounts of recovered wealth.   

The United Nations gave approval last month for the U.S. government to release $1.5 billion in frozen Libyan assets to Libya's National Transitional Council (NTC), but a U.S. official said Thursday that the NTC had asked for the release so far of only about $700 million of that amount.   

European officials and private experts said there is no worldwide legal framework or treaty setting procedures for tracing, recovering and repatriating assets misappropriated or abused by deposed regimes. 

'There is no single international 
legal regime,' so assets will have to be recovered country by country, 
said Jonathan Winer, a former U.S. State Department official.    

Efforts
to recover assets could be further complicated by legal claims, for 
example from victims of violence such as IRA bombings in Northern 
Ireland carried out with explosives allegedly supplied by Gaddafi, said 
Winer.   

Dealing with 
such claims and recovering all assets acquired over Gaddafi's 42-year 
reign is going to be an 'unholy legal mess to sort out,' he said.

Bankers managing assets for Gaddafi and his family might 'now act as if the assets belong to them,' particularly with those converted into personal holdings, said Comras.    

'Some of these culprits may eventually be brought to justice. Others are likely to remain undiscovered,' Comras said.   

Countries where Libyan sovereign assets deemed to have been under the control of Gaddafi or his family include the United States, Britain, Italy, Switzerland, Malta and several African nations.   

A State Department cable made public by WikiLeaks said that, as of 2006, a Libyan government fund's holdings in Italy included 2 per cent of Fiat, 15 per cent of Tamoil energy company, and 7.5 per cent of soccer club Juventus where Gaddafi's son Saadi once sat on the board. The cable said the fund, known as LFICO, also had over $500 million in investments in Britain.

Pearson, the British publishing giant which owns London's Financial Times, announced in March that, under legal advice, it had frozen a 3.27 percent stake in its shares held by the Libyan Investment Authority.   

'We are monitoring the situation closely,' a spokesman for Pearson said on Friday. 'Once the relevant sanctions are lifted, Pearson will take the necessary steps to ensure that the shares and any dividends paid into a blocked account are unfrozen as soon as possible.'

A significant amount is still in the hands of surviving members of the deposed tyrant’s family, and could be used to fund insurgents in the newly liberated Libya.

Large sums are likely to be in neighbouring countries like Algeria, which are being used as safe havens for Gaddafi’s wife and grown-up children, and grandchildren.

It is also thought that members of the Gaddafi family who fled to Algeria were carrying gold bars.

In the UK alone, Gaddafi's family owned an £11 million house in Hampstead, north London, and a range of shops and offices in the city's West End.

The palatial neo-Georgian townhouse was used by the tyrant's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi before it was taken over by squatters in March.

It has a swimming pool and suede-lined cinema room and was purchased in 2009 - but its future is now uncertain.

Today, officials claimed Saif has been captured close to Tripoli after suffering critical injuries in a bombing raid.

The regime also owned Portman House, a 146,550 sq ft retail complex in Oxford Street, London, which houses retailers such as Boots and New Look, and an office at 14 Cornhill, opposite the Bank of England in the City.

In Spain, Gaddafi's Libyan Arab Foreign Bank bought a 7,065-hectare (17,450-acre) property on the Costa del Sol in Andalucia in 1995.

The Libyan Arab Foreign Bank, which is owned by Libya's central bank, had tried to build an 18-hole golf course and about 2,000 homes on the land.

Another property owned by Gaddafi in the regime's name was a plush estate called Thunder Rock in Englewood, New Jersey.

The Government has also held £12 billion deposited in UK banks. The U.S. has frozen £20 billion, Italy £6 billion, Canada £2.4 billion, Austria £1.66 billion and £680 million in Switzerland.

Among Gaddafi's investments via the Libya Central Bank are a 3 per cent stake in Pearson Plc, publisher of the Financial Times.

Since formally recognising Libya's National Transitional Council, the U.S. government has begun the process of handing back the war torn country's assets.

In August the United Nations Security Council approved an immediate infusion of $1.5 billion that the U.S. had seized.

Officials said the money was urgently needed to provide basic services, especially electricity.

Since then billions have been unfrozen by countries around the world. However so far that has not run smoothly.

With so much uncertainty over the governance of Libya, questions have been asked over whither it should go directly to the NTC or instead by used for humanitarian needs.

And some countries, such as South Africa, have resisted the call to give Libya's billions back.

Investigators around the world will be powerless to find much of the wealth because it will be hidden away with intermediaries and in secret accounts, said France-based Libyan financial analyst Mohammed Haraba.

'The Gaddafis spent years doing what super rich people all over the world do – they hide it,' said Mr Haraba.

'It will be in western financial institutions but also in the hands of those who run former allied countries like Algeria, Syria, and even Zimbabwe.

'The great fear is that survivors from the Gaddafi ruling elite, including members of the family, will be able to get hold of the money so as to fund revolutionary activity in Libya.'

Mr Haraba said it was likely new Libyan regime would look to freeze all of the known assets of the Gaddafi family, as the new government in neighbouring Egypt did with the assets of deposed Hosni Mubarak and his family.
