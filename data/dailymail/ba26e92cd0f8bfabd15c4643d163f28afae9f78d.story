With Argo receiving gongs galore this awards season, Ben Affleck has made his mark on the film industry.

And now the director and star of Argo has made his mark on the fashion world too, thanks to his fondness for a bag his CIA agent character Tony Mendez uses in the movie.

The bag, a £225 canvas holdall made by small Lake District firm The Sporting Lodge, appears in scenes being carried around Tehran by Mendez as he tries to rescue a group of diplomats.

And Affleck is said to have liked the bag so much that he took the two used in filming home with him.

Famous bag: Ben Affleck fell in love with it in Argo (R), and now the Westmorland Bag is putting a Lake District firm in the limelight. Lindsay MacFarlaine, director of the Sporting Lodge in Storth (L) shows off her work

The Westmorland bag was created 
especially for the film's costume department by the Storth-based firm 
after they received a request for a shoulder bag to be used by Affleck's
character.

Sporting Lodge director Lindsay MacFarlaine, whose father George founded the business in 1952, said 'Hollywood had called' 18 months ago.

'We were asked to make a bag which could be used in screen tests, and had just two weeks to turn it around and send it out there,' she said.

'The brief was to create something really hardwearing for a CIA agent, and we wanted to introduce a bit of colour.

Designer: The Sporting Lodge was asked to design a shoulder bag to be used by Ben's character in the film Argo but had no idea of its future success

'It was made by hand from triple-layered waterproof canvas, with a bridle leather trim.

'Until six months ago we had no idea they had decided to go with it and that it had been used quite extensively in the film.'

After they designed the limited edition bag, named The Westmorland, it was manufactured by the firm's long-time collaborator, bag-maker Brady.

Just 13 copies were made, with Sporting Lodge keeping two, and two being used in the film.

The rest have sold out - no doubt thanks to Affleck's association.

Mrs MacFarlaine said: 'We called it The Westmorland because we thought why not promote this part of the world?'

'It is particularly pleasing that Hollywood has turned to the finest English manufacturing to feature in such a well-thought of film.

'We have collaborated with Hollywood in the past by making products for other films and on this occasion we chose one of our oldest suppliers, who we have been working with for over 53 years, and one of the finest bag and shooting accessories manufacturer in the world.

'An added bonus for us was that Ben Affleck insisted on taking the bags home with him after shooting the film.'

This shoulder bag is made by hand from 
triple layered waterproof canvas in Olive Green, with Tan bridle leather
trim using the finest quality materials and employing traditional 
English craftsmanship and each bag is stamped with it's own unique 
number.

Added bonus: Sporting Lodge say an added bonus for them was that Ben Affleck insisted on taking the bags home with him after shooting the film
