The head of a celebrity rehab centre which treated Amy Winehouse faces being struck off after being found to have falsely claimed to be a doctor.

Brendan Quinn, a former nurse, co-founded the Causeway Retreat, an addiction clinic based in a remote manor house on Osea Island off the coast of Essex in 2005.

The £10,000-a-week centre also treated Take That star Mark Owen, actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and members of some of Britain’s wealthiest families.

But following the death by suicide of at least two former patients, including Channel 4 executive Sarah Mulvey, health watchdogs launched an investigation.

It was was closed in 2010 after being refused registration by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).

The firm behind the clinic, 27 Management, in which Quinn was a major shareholder, was taken to court at the time and was fined £8,000 for running an unlicensed hospital.

The judge said the standards at Causeway Retreat 'would really shame a Third World country'. 

Today Quinn, of Lewes, East Sussex, was found guilty of a string of misconduct charges against him that included leaving drugs in a suitcase in an unlocked room and failing to properly supervise patients. 

It followed a series of sticky and high-profile legal proceedings involving Quinn, who described himself as a 'specialist nurse'.  

Channel 4 executive Sarah Mulvey, who was behind hit shows like ‘10 Years Younger’ and ‘How To Look Good Naked,’ committed suicide in January 2010 after she was treated at the Retreat.

Miss Mulvey had stayed at the property in May 2009, after being signed off from work with stress.

She had self-harmed and made a suicide attempt the day before she was told by staff to leave the island.

At an inquest into her death, her father, Dr Christopher Mulvey, criticised the clinic, saying: ‘There were so many opportunities at this point to help her and they were not taken.’

Advertising material for the Causeway retreat named Quinn as one of Britain’s 250 best private doctors, when he was not even qualified, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

He was also found to have admitted patients with mental health problems to the unlicensed facility, which did not have a doctor on site at all times. 

While he was in charge medication was administered by unqualified staff without valid prescriptions and drugs were stored in a suitcase in an unlocked room. 

And Quinn also failed to tell employees they were working illegally in an unlicensed hospital. 

The hearing into Quinn’s management of the Causeway began in 2012 and has been adjourned at least five times, having run for more than 90 days, costing the taxpayer more than £300,000. 

Quinn denied all the allegations against him, insisting former staff members had cooked up elaborate stories to ruin his reputation.

He said: ‘They have been determined to absolutely destroy my career and indeed they’ve done an absolutely superb job.

‘They have come here and they have given evidence and they’ve had regular meetings outside this process.’

He claimed he had also been bombarded with anonymous text messages from pay-as-you go phones threatening him and his family.

But the panel dismissed Quinn’s claims of an elaborate conspiracy saying it ‘lacks credibility'.

James Spencer, NMC panel chair, said: ‘A number of assertions you made during the course of your evidence did not stand up to scrutiny.

‘The panel finds that holding yourself out as a doctor, in the way that you did was dishonest.’

Earlier Krystal Whymet for the NMC said: ‘Quinn allowed for clients to be admitted to Causeway who were suffering from mental health matters, even when warned by the CSCI (Commission for Social Care Inspection) that this was not appropriate.

‘He did not ensure that the clients suffering from mental health matters were adequately assessed of supervised.

‘He did not ensure that patients with mental health matters were provided with adequate treatment plans or aftercare.

‘The registrant allowed a client who had suffered a stroke to be admitted to the Causeway despite not having adequate facilities for mobility restricted patients.

‘He failed to ensure that adequate arrangements were in place to prevent risks to the health and safety of clients staff and visitors.’ 

The NMC will consider whether Quinn’s fitness to practise is impaired by reason of misconduct on 24 November.
