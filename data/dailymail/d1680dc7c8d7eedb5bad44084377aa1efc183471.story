A husband who strangled his wife with a scarf after she told him their marriage was over has been jailed for life.

Muhammed Hussain Iqbal, 29, killed Salma Parveen, 22, in the bedroom of their home after he had seen her kissing another man. 

Iqbal killed Salma, a bank clerk, by wrapping a scarf around her neck as she was getting ready for work on April 29 last year.

He then bound her hands and feet with more scarves and hid her body in their house in Coventry, West Midlands, before fleeing on a train for London.

He handed himself in to police a day later, saying: 'I come from Coventry where I’ve committed a murder.'

Despite confessing to killing Salma in police interviews, Iqbal pleaded not guilty to one count of murder.

But he was found guilty by a jury of four men and eight women after a three-week trial at Stafford Crown Court.

He has now been jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years behind bars.

Speaking after the case, sergeant Mick Griffiths, from West Midlands Police, said after the case: 'Throughout this trial Iqbal claimed that he didn’t intend to kill Salma and that he had suffered a loss of control due to provocation.

'He has changed his defence and alleged in court that Salma attacked him with a knife.

'This was pure fabrication and the jury saw through these lies.

'Their relationship had broken down and Salma wanted him to leave the family home.

'Iqbal chose his moment carefully and then struck. Salma had no chance to defend herself and he killed her in a fit of temper.'

The court heard the couple married in an Islamic ceremony in 2012 but to secure Iqbal’s visa - which expired this year - he wanted to tie the knot in a civil ceremony.

But he became enraged when he found out Salma - who had been having an affair with a city councillor for over three years - had cancelled the wedding just weeks before her death

The jury were told Salma was murdered within hours of Iqbal allegedly seeing her kissing another man.

Married Coventry councillor Kamran Caan admitted to the court he had an affair with the 22-year-old which started in 2009 or 2010.

The Labour representative for Upper Stoke called Salma his 'Cinderella' in text messages but said he had no intention of leaving his wife for her.

Jurors heard that Mr Caan, who was elected in 2012, had gone to the Britannia Hotel in Coventry city centre with her three times in the weeks before her death.

After one visit, Ms Parveen text her lover saying: 'One hour isn’t enough - it’s just the frustration'.

Mr Caan replied: 'Babes - it’s better than nothing'.

The court heard they had exchanged numerous other messages in the weeks before her death and had arranged to meet on April 30 - the day after she was killed.

Before her death Ms Parveen had searched the internet for 'mistress', as well as the UK Border Agency and a news article in which David Cameron called for illegal immigrants to be reported to the authorities.

The victim’s father also told the court Iqbal behaved like a 'pyscho' in the weeks before his daughter’s death.

Tariq Bashir said: 'She told me he was getting angry about silly things.

'He was throwing things around at night. She was feeling very worried and nervous.

'She called him a psycho. She did come to stay with me for about a week in March.

'He was pushing her for the register office date. It was the next step maybe to get to stay here.

'She said he was throwing things around and being very violent.

'She was scared. I said that if he ever hurts you the police station is just opposite.'

After sentencing her family paid tribute to a 'beautiful' daughter.

They said: 'Salma was the spark of our family and full of ambitions and dreams waiting to come true.

'Her life has not only been taken away from her, our lifestyle, spark and bonding of the family has also gone with her.

'Salma was the person we could trust with our eyes closed, the person who was always there for us, the person who we all looked up to.

'She was so beautiful and so was her heart. She was full of energy and up for any challenge regardless of how difficult it was.'
