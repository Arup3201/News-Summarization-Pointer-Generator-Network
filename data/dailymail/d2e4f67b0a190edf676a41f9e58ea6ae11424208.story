They call Pele the greatest of all time and most of the world agrees.

Many here in Brazil call Garrincha even greater that Pele because he played football with the rhythmic soul of the samba nation and personified the spirit of the beautiful game.

They call Ronaldo the Phenomenon because how he ever came back on crippled legs to win one of their five World Cups so far and thus become the leading goalscorer in the history of the these Finals defies mortal rationalisation.

Samba magic: Neymar has scored four goals at this World Cup to fire Brazil into the last 16

Finisher: Following his double against Cameroon, Neymar has 37 goals in 53 internationals for Brazil

VIDEO Neymar better than Pele

Age: 22 (D.O.B. 05/02/1992)

Born: Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil

Position: Forward

Clubs: Santos (2009-13), Barcelona (2013-)

International debut: August 10, 2010 vs USA

International caps: 53

First international goal: August 10, 2010 vs USA

International goals: 37

They don’t know what to call Neymar. 

Not yet.

But what they do suspect is that they may, just may, have found Brazil’s successor to the legend of Edson Arantes do Nascimento.

If Neymar da Silva Santos Junior is the next Pele then we are watching it happen at this World Cup.

What makes this all the more possible – not to mention so thrilling that we hardly dare believe it – is that this young man refuses to countenance any such comparison.

‘Pele is a god,’ he says. ‘I’m a footballer.’

You have to love a boy - he is still only 22 - who insists on having Neymar Jr inscribed on the back of that imperishable yellow shirt in reverence of his father.

No that his football playing dad ever scored a goal of genius like the first of the two he put past Cameroon to ensure that the host nation dazzle on to the last 16 of the first World Cup played in this spiritual home of the beautiful game since 1950.

But it speaks of respect.

Looking up: Arguably only Pele and Garrincha now stand ahead of Neymar in the list of Brazilian greats

Poise: Neymar readies himself to score Brazil's opening goal against Cameroon in their 4-1 World Cup victory

1) Pele - 77 goals (92 caps)

2) Zico - 66 goals (88 caps)

3) Ronaldo - 62 goals (98 caps)

4) Romario - 55 goals (70 caps)

5) Bebeto - 39 goals (75 caps)

6) Neymar - 37 goals (53 caps)

Neymar has already had with a former girlfriend a son, who he vows will always be central to his life, plus a tabloid affair with a glamourous TV celebrity. Yet he remains the fresh-faced lad every Brazilian mother would love her daughter to bring home for dinner.

Yet there is a feisty edge to this personality which is reminiscent, also, of the icon whose boots he is being called upon to fill.

Pele could look after himself on the pitch if put to the intimidation. Similarly, when a Cameroon heavy gave him a gratuitous and potentially wounding shove into the cameramen and their heavy equipment, Neymar brushed away the false hand of apology and promptly sent his assailant and his team=mates on their way home with another defeat.

We will come to recall many moments when Neymar convinced of his greatness but that will remain one of mine. Along, of course, with the goals and the wondrous touches of skill.

The magic is beginning to enchant the watching world, especially as it its couched within his boyish charm.

Reverence: The 22-year-old insists on having 'Neymar Jr' on his back, such is his respect for his father

The best: Pele is widely regarded as Brazil's greatest ever player but Neymar is now making his mark

Treble: Pele won three World Cups and Neymar is hoping to inspire Brazil to their sixth triumph

He scores, four times already on his way to what may be his winning of the Golden Boot at this World Cup. He winks cheekily. He smiles. He mingles with the Brazilian people as if he is still simply one of their own.

In that, he is more reminiscent of Garrincha than Pele. For that, they love him all the more.

But in the reckoning it is the exquisite ability that counts.

In a game increasingly populated by men of muscle and power, he is a wraith wrapped around silken skills. In that he reminds me of George Best, a will o’ the wisp with the courage to deliver his talent.

I defer to no-one in my worship of the pantheon of Brazilian footballers but in my estimation Neymar is close to superceding most of them... Zico, Falcao, Didi, Vava, Jairzinho, Rivellino, Romario and Ronaldinho included.

Time will be the judge, of course. But he is so good that the modern generation have a discussion in which to engage which is of their time.

The tendency has been to propose Lionel Messsi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the current pretenders to the thrones of not only Pele and Co but Diego Maradona, Alfredo di Stefano and Johan Cruyff.

Class: Arguably only Garrincha (left) and Pele now stand ahead of Neymar in Brazil's all-time great list

Both are marvellous player but Neymar brings something all the more valid to the debate.

Messi tends to operate on the wide right so as to cut in onto this wand of a  left foot and Ronaldo is inclined to work the left flank in readiness for angling in onto his potent right.

But Neymar works where it hurts, where it can do the most damage, where it really matters.

Through the middle.

That is how he has come to play 53 games for his country at such a tender age, scoring 37 goals in the process. That is why he just might win this World Cup for Brazil. That is why he is climbing so quickly through the ranks of greatness.

I would suggest that only two giants remain for him to elevate himself above - Pele and Garrincha.

That enormous task does not appear to be beyond him. It will take more than one World Cup to make it happen but if he works his magic here, he could well be on his way to immortality. 

Perhaps, one day, he will be talked of not as the new Pele - but as the first Neymar.
