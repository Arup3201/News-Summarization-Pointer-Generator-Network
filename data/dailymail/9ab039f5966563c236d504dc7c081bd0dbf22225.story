A Maryland couple has created a bucket list of fun activities for their dog - who is suffering from cancer - to enjoy.

Essam and Kathryn Shomali created the list after their beagle Little Joe, often simply referred to as 'L.J.,' was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma.

'The whole point of this was just to have some fun - fun for us and fun with L.J., and have great memories with L.J. and just to celebrate L.J.,' Essam Shomali told ABC.

The Somalis' list includes fifteen activities, the channel reported. Little Joe has yet to eat a Big Mac, meet a famous and/or police dog, visit a dog spa, and go for a summer swim.

The couple also plans to for Little Joe to have a birthday party, ride in a motorcycle, ride in a fire truck and eat a steak in the park. Many of those activities are already scheduled.   

Little Joe has already eaten an ice cream cone and appeared on the news. He and his owners have also made charitable contributions to both a church and the Maryland SPCA. They have also donated to the Beagle Freedom Project, which aims to place beagles used as laboratory subjects in loving homes.

The pooch even went on a 'blind date' with another dog named Jilly, the Baltimore Sun reported.

'My heart went out to (their) little guy,' her owner Linda Prokopic told the Sun. 'I'm a huge dog lover and I felt Jilly would be a fantastic date. I have a big fenced in backyard so it seemed ideal.'

Prokopic added that the date 'was like a walk only better.'

It's not clear how long Little Joe will live, but the Shomalis hope he will meet their unborn baby at the end of the year, according to the Sun.

'There’s so many people out there that have a love for their animals and do treat their pets as kids and can relate to this type of relationship,' Essam Shomali told ABC. 'It’s been a lot of fun, and that was the main goal.'
