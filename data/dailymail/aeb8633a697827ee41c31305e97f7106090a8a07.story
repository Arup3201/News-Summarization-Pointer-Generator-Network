Strange case: Richard E. Fletcher, pictured, was sentenced to 15 years and eight months on an unrelated charge of sexual exploitation of a minor last week but the judge said evidence showed he was involved in the killing of Mary 'Pat' O'Hagan

A 26-year-old Vermont man has avoided a murder charge despite having confessed to helping kill a 78-year-old grandmother and a judge claiming there was enough evidence to show he at least cleaned up after the slaying and dumped the body.

Richard E. Fletcher was sentenced to 15 years and eight months on an unrelated charge of sexual exploitation of a minor last week, but the entire trial focused on the death of Mary 'Pat' O'Hagan.

Judge Christina Reiss said she considered allegations that the defendant participated in the killing of O'Hagan in 2010 and imposed a sentence that was eight months more than the minimum sentence.

'Obviously, we think our mother's worth more than eight months,' Matt O'Hagan, one of O'Hagan's five children, told the Burlington Free Press after the hearing, adding that the family was appalled by the outcome.

'We certainly aren't happy.'

No one has been charged in connection with the death of the grandmother-of-nine, who disappeared from her home in September 2010 only to be found dead three weeks later by duck hunters in nearby Wheelock.

However, police claim Fletcher, his brother Keith J. Baird, 32, and Fletcherâ€™s cousin Michael Norrie, 22, who are all in custody on various unrelated charges, are responsible for the slaying after an ill-fated robbery attempt.

State prosecutors have previously said they lack evidence to prove murder charges against the three men, despite having confessions.

Suspect: Michael Norrie, who police say was also involved in the murder, is seen in court in St. Johnsbury, Vermont in 2011

On Tuesday, one of duck hunters who found O'Hagan's body, former correctional officer Jordan Owens, testified that Fletcher confessed to being involved in her murder in 2011 while at a prison in St. Johnsbury.

'He told me that when he closed his eyes, he would see the image of Pat O'Hagan, and that she was haunting him,' Owens said in court on Tuesday, according to the Free Press.

After two days of testimony, Reiss determined the evidence showed that Fletcher helped clean up after the killing at O'Hagan's home in Sheffield and helped dispose of O'Hagan's body in Wheelock.

She said there wasn't enough evidence to prove Fletcher shot and killed O'Hagan.

Reiss said it was 'highly unusual' for a judge to consider an 'unrelated, uncharged state crime' in the sentencing of another crime.
