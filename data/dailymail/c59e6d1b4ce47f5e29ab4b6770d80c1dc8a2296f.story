Warning: Stephen Hester, the RBS chief executive, warned today that it could take 10 years for the government to dispose of its 81 per cent stake in the bank

The sale of state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland so taxpayers can be repaid their £45billion stake could drag on for a decade, according to its outgoing chief executive.

Stephen Hester said that privatising the bank was a long-term project that could take until 2023.

Mr Hester was pushed out last week in a move approved by Chancellor George Osborne, although he will pick up a golden goodbye worth up to £5.6million.

He was brought in to run the bank after the Treasury was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis five years ago by buying an 81 per cent stake.

But Mr Osborne believes he is not the right person to guide the bank through privatisation.

Mr Hester said: ‘It is clearly up to the Government how it privatises, when it privatises and what the important features are.

‘My observation is that if the desired proceeds are £45billion, then there has never been a privatisation that raises that much in one go.

It is likely that it would be, if you do it conventionally, four or five goes over ten years.

‘That’s why I’ve always been confident that the state would get its £45billion back.’

He said he would support a wholesale giveaway of shares to the public, in the style of the privatisation of British Gas in the Eighties, which was marketed with the ‘Tell Sid’ ad campaign.

Mr Hester said that while such a giveaway was ‘perfectly legitimate’, Mr Osborne had to consider the politics of the sale as well as the economics.

He claimed he did not feel any anger over the manner of his departure, adding: ‘I don’t want to show frustration, I don’t want to punch someone in the eye.

Sell-off: The government is hoping to recoup the full £45billion it spent bailing out the Royal Bank of Scotland at the height of the financial crisis

‘I haven’t hidden from anyone that I am torn a bit at this juncture.

‘Part of me did want to see the job 
fully through, did want the champagne and roses of a successful 
privatisation. Another part of me thought, “Goodness me, this job drives
me nuts from time to time and how long do I want to do it for?”.

‘I genuinely mean I am comfortable 
with what has happened. RBS is in much better shape than we had any 
right to think it could be. I want the company to have a good future and
I want to pass the baton on smoothly and without rancour or difficulty.
I am happy with this result.’

The Treasury is said to agree that 
the sell-off will take a while. Sources said last week it would take 
‘many years’ to complete what would be the biggest privatisation in 
history.

Replacing Mr Hester is expected to 
take at least six months, with Mr Osborne reportedly sharing the RBS 
board’s view that the next chief executive must be prepared to stay on 
for at least five years.

A £1 billion rescue plan for the Co-operative's troubled banking arm is set to be unveiled this week in a move likely to hit up to 5,000 small investors.

The mutual has been racing to plug a shortfall of up to £1.5 billion in its finances identified by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the new City watchdog.

It is likely to do so through the disposal of its insurance business and a portfolio of loans, although the Sunday Times said a large part of the cash is expected to come from bondholders.

This would impact more than 5,000 investors who lent money to the Co-op through securities called permanent interest bearing shares that pay dividends of up to 13 per cent a year.

As much as 30 per cent of their cash could be wiped out or transferred into a new vehicle, it was reported.

No taxpayers' money will be involved and the Co-op will be spared from having to sell other assets in the wider group, such as its pharmacy chain.

The black hole in the Co-op's capital reserves largely stems from commercial property loans acquired through a merger with the Britannia building society in 2009 that created a financial 'super-mutual'.
