Chelsea have yet to make a formal offer of a new contract to Branislav Ivanovic.

The 31-year-old defender has been outstanding this season adding vital goals to his defensive performances but he is out of contract next year.

Jose Mourinho has asked the club to sort out a new deal and Chelsea have every intention of making him an offer but it is unlikely to be more than a one-year deal with another one-year option.

Branislav Ivanovic is waiting for a new contract offer from Chelsea with his deal expiring in 2016

Paris St Germain and Real Madrid are both monitoring Ivanovic's situation with Chelsea unlikely to discuss any new contract until the end of the season.

Ivanovic is settled at Chelsea and a popular figure among staff and team-mates but knows he could wait until January and sign a pre-contract with greater security at another club.

Meanwhile, Bolton want to take young Chelsea struiker Islam Feruz on loan for the rest of the season.

The Serbia defender has been a vital player for Chelsea both at the back and going forwards
