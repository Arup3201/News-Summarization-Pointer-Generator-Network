Football star Matthew Stafford narrowly avoided a collapsing pedestrian bridge on a Detroit freeway this morning.

Stafford, quarterback for the Detroit Lions, was driving to practice when the bridge was hit by waste haulage truck with its boom up, which knocked down the structure.

State police confirmed that the man died as the huge clean-up operation began, leaving traffic backed up for miles.

Collapse: The bridge came down over the Southfield Freeway in Detroit early this morning 

Caught in the chaos: Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was seen near the collapsed bridge at around 6am

Carnage: The bridge's concrete pillars were wrenched from their station when the truck collided with them

Stafford was among those stranded by the accident, but was picked up by the Lions' head of security and was taken on to practice. 

A truck driver is dead after smashing into a bridge over a freeway, bringing it crashing to the ground.

The 15ft pedestrian bridge, which crossed the Southfield Freeway in Detroit, Michigan, was left a mangled wreck after the collision just before 6am today.

State police confirmed that the driver of the truck was killed. He was taken from the scene by stretcher and pronounced dead at a hospital.

Brought down: The 15ft bridge - which was in 'fair to good' condition, according to authorities, was left blocking the road

The road was closed - with transport authorities predicting that the wreckage could take days to clear, WXYZ-TV reported.

The road was closed from Interstate 96 to Joy Road - a distance of around a mile and a half.

It is believed that the truck, a waste haulage vehicle, had its boom raised when it drove into the bridge.

Speaking from the football pitch this afternoon, Stafford told CBS: 'Obviously you don’t expect to see a bridge down, you know, on the highway.

'But I was just mostly worried about trying to get her as fast as I could; and, obviously, the health of the driver.'

Michigan State Police Lt. Michael Shaw said: 'When the boom struck the bridge, it actually pulled the bridge down with it.'

'It's just the beginning of rush hour, so nobody else was struck. If this would have happened maybe an hour later it would have been a lot worse.'

Nobody was on the bridge at the time. 

State transportation officials said the bridge was in 'fair to good' condition, meaning that it was safe for use before being hit by the truck. 

Shaw said the driver was taken to a hospital and died, but he didn't have details about what caused the driver's death. The driver's identity has not been released.

Smash: This truck - believed to be the one which brought down the bridge - was pictured not far from the scene this morning

Barnika Cage, who lives a block from the bridge, told The Detroit News she heard a 'boom' sound, went down the street and saw that the bridge had fallen. She said she saw a man get out of the truck, stumble, and then fall face first on the grass along the freeway.

She said: 'There was blood all over his face. I was just praying he was OK.'

Traffic is backed up for miles in both directions at the scene, and officials are urging drivers to take different routes. The I-96 freeway was closed temporarily but is now open as usual.

According to MDOT, the wreckage of the bridge will start to be removed this morning.

Officials couldn't say for sure how long the roadway would be closed.
