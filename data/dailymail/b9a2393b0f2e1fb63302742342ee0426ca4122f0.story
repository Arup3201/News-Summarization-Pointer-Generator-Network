Britain is at the centre of a fresh spying scandal today after its agents apparently intercepted phone calls and monitored the computers of foreign officials at two major meetings held in London.

It is alleged the UK's secret services even tricked delegates into using internet cafes they had set up at the 2009 G20 summits to allow British intelligence agencies to easily read their emails.

GCHQ documents seen by the Guardian, labelled top secret, even bragged about the 'successes' of spying at G20, and named at least two targets of the spying - long-standing allies Turkey and South Africa.

A large number of smartphones and BlackBerrys were tapped to harvest confidential calls, emails and documents, which 'provided timely information to UK ministers', according to confidential slides leaked by US whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The embarrassing news comes as Britain 
prepares to host a G8 summit for nations which were all present - and 
spied upon - in 2009.

It raises new questions about the boundaries of surveillance by GCHQ, the UK intelligence agency, and its US sister organisation, the National Security Agency.

Ministers say access to phone records and internet data is necessary in the fight against terrorism and serious crime.

The 2009 spying appears to have been organised for a less important purpose - securing an advantage in meetings.

Secrets: The data about the apparent British spying is alleged to have come from Edward Snowden. a former technical assistant for the CIA who has fled to Hong Kong

Eavesdropping: GCHQ, Britain's electronic listening agency, mounted an intensive spying operation on foreign politicians attending two G20 summit meetings in London in 2009, it has been reported

During G20 meetings in April and September 2009, GCHQ used what one document calls ‘ground-breaking intelligence capabilities’ to intercept the communications of visiting delegations.

This included setting up internet cafes where they used an email interception programme and key-logging software to spy on delegates’ use of computers; and penetrating the security on delegates’ BlackBerrys to monitor their email messages and phone calls.

Other moves also include supplying 45 
analysts with a live round-the-clock summary of who was phoning who at 
the summit; and targeting the Turkish finance minister and possibly 15 
others in his party.

The 
documents suggest that the operation was sanctioned in principle at a 
senior level in the government of Gordon Brown, the then prime minister -
and that intelligence, including briefings for visiting delegates, was 
passed to British ministers.

An
outline of the objectives of 'spying' on delegates written by GCHQ 
director Sir Iain Lobban was handed out to officials, according to The 
Guardian.

One report seen 
by the newspaper explains the efforts that NSA specialists working at 
Menwith Hill in North Yorkshire went to to decode encrypted telephone 
calls by Russian president Dmitry Medvedev.

In a September meeting of G20 finance ministers GCHQ details of intercepted calls were displayed on a giant screen of the organisation's operations centre as well as to individual officials' screens.

That information was then quickly passed on to UK delegates at the summit to provide them information to use for negotiations.

Officials were also able to get hold of advanced copies of G20 briefings to ministers by bypassing BlackBerry security.

GCHQ was able to spy on the foreign diplomats under the 1994 Intelligence Services Act (ISA) which allows Britain's security services to conduct such operations with ministerial authority.

Important: Then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown made the summit a top strategic priority

The law includes a clause which says that agencies should operate 'in the interests of economic wellbeing of the UK'.

The ISA was greeted with great suspicion by European countries when it came into force because countries were concerned that British companies would have access to intelligence that would give them a competitive edge over rival foreign firms.

It is not clear whether ISA was specifically invoked for the G20 meetings but then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown had made the summit a strategic priority so it was likely that it had.
