An elaborate 300-year-old ring, discovered in mud in a maize field, has been officially classified as treasure.

Metal detectorist Ron Pitman, of Swansea, found the gold and silver ring on farmland in Gower.

The ring’s outer surface is engraved with a trellis-style pattern, while its inner surface is inscribed with the words 'prepared bee to follow me’.

Metal detectorist Ron Pitman, of Swansea, found the gold and silver ring (pictured) in 2010. The ring’s outer surface is engraved with a trellis-style pattern, while its inner surface is inscribed with ‘prepared bee to follow me’. The extra e in ‘be’ was said to have been a common feature in the late 1600s

The extra e in ‘be’ was said to have been a common feature during the mid to late 1600s.

The estimated value of the ring was not disclosed, but Mr Pitman will receive a finder’s fee. This fee, will also be split with the landowners.

Mr Pitman discovered the ring in a field used to grow maize that had been ploughed and rolled, in October 2010. 

This meant the jewellery sat just 5-inches (13cm) below the surface.

It is said to be made up of around 81 per cent gold and 9 per silver and resembles a mourning ring.

Reports of mourning rings were first seen during the Middle Ages, but became more common during the 17th century. 

The estimated value of the ring was not disclosed, but Mr Pitman will receive a finder’s fee. This fee, will also be split with the landowners. The 17th century jewellery was officially classified as treasure at a hearing in Swansea earlier today, and is now the property of the Crown

Rings were engraved with the names and dates of the deceased, or a decorative design was inscribed on black enamel. 

People would leave instructions in their wills for money to be used by the executors to buy and engrave such rings. 

Following the Great Plague of London in the 1660s, for example, mourning rings had to be made in enormous quantities.

The Gower ring also bears a resemblance to the fictional ring seen in the Lord of the Rings.

Mark Redknapp of the Department of Archaeology and Numismatics at the National Museum in Cardiff who examined the ring, said: ‘Such rings can be difficult to date but the decoration and sentiments in this case suggests a 17th rather than 18th century date.

‘It is my opinion that as an object which has at least 10 per cent by weight precious metal which is at least 300 years old.

‘The ring therefore is treasure.’

There have been previous examples of rings found in the UK with similar engravings, such as ‘Wee part to meete’, dated to 1658.

The National Museum in Cardiff added that rings with similar decorations have also been found at Old Beaupre, Vale of Glamorgan, and at a a site east of Colchester, both dating back to around 1667.

The 17th century jewellery was given the classification at a hearing in Swansea earlier today and is now the property of the Crown.

The acting coroner said Swansea Museum has since expressed an interest in bidding for the ring.
