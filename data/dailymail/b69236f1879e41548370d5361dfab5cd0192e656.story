Yahoo's second-in-command Henrique de Castro has been fired by CEO Marissa Mayer after just 15 months on the job - but his severance package should help sweeten the surprise dismissal.

De Castro, 48, will receive an estimated $109million from his brief stint at the company, based on salary, bonus, stocks and his compensation for decamping from Google in 2012. 

Mayer cut her top lieutenant in a 
possible sign that the Internet company's efforts to revive its 
long-slumping advertising sales aren't paying off.

Wednesday's
 surprise announcement of the departure of Yahoo's chief operating 
officer, represents a setback for Mayer, who signed him to a $58 million contract just 15 months ago.

Henrique de Castro, 48, who is originally from Portugal, received his first business degree from the University of Lisbon.

He went on to study for an MBA in Switzerland before becoming a consultant at McKinsey. He later worked with ex-boss Marissa Mayer at Google.

De Castro sits on the boards of several major companies including Target which he joined in 2013.

According to a 2012 Business Insider profile of de Castro, the executive was not well-liked by people under him.

Former Google colleagues described him as a 'difficult personality'. Another told BI: 'Henrique wants to be The Most Interesting Man In The World from those Dos Equis commercials.'

De Castro's hire was planned by Mayer
 to help her lure more advertisers to a company that has been struggling
 to compete against Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. in the race for online
 marketing dollars.

Yahoo Inc. declined to comment on the reasons for de Castro's abrupt exit. Mayer didn't name his replacement.

In a terse memo, leaked to Recode, Mayer wrote: 'I made the difficult decision that our COO, Henrique de Castro, should leave the company. I appreciate Henrique’s contributions and wish him the best in his future endeavors.'

She added: 'Overall, I’m confident that the leadership team, our direction, and these changes will enable even more successful execution.'

It's doubtful de Castro would be leaving if he were bringing in the revenue that Mayer envisioned, said BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis.

'This was one of her key hires and he is already gone,' Gillis said. 'It doesn't look good.'

Mayer, who knew de Castro from the days when both executives worked at Google, will likely be questioned about what went wrong when she reviews Yahoo's financial results for the fourth quarter, scheduled to come out January 28.

The Sunnyvale, California, company hasn't warned that it missed its revenue forecast for the three-month period ending in December, an indication that Yahoo must have at least been reasonably close to hitting that financial target set by Mayer.

Yahoo had projected fourth-quarter revenue of about $1.2 billion after paying commissions to its ad partners, unchanged from the previous year.

De Castro will leave Yahoo with much of the money and stock that he got when Mayer lured him to California from a Google advertising job in Europe.

Things aren't all bad for Henrique de Castro following his surprise exit from Yahoo.

He made an estimated $109 million from his brief 15 months at the company, including salary, bonus, stocks, compensation for leaving Google and severance pay, according to Equilar Inc., a compensation researcher, quoted by Bloomberg.

De Castro is entitled to $20 million restricted stock bonus. This is on top of the $39.2 million package in cash and stock that he received in 2012.

De Castro also will receive $1.2 million to cover the next two years of his salary.

De Castro's termination by CEO Marissa Mayer is effective from today.

His severance package includes $20 million of restricted stock that wasn't scheduled to fully vest until late 2016. He also will receive $1.2 million to cover the next two years of his salary. His rights to another batch of restricted stock valued at $9 million also have vested.

Although de Castro's hiring turned out to be an expensive mistake, Mayer is unlikely to face a harsh backlash from Yahoo stockholders who have made a lot of money since she defected from Google in July 2012.

Yahoo's stock has nearly tripled in value since Mayer's arrival, even though the company's revenue hasn't increased under her leadership.

The company's shares dipped 7 cents to close at $41.07, then slipped another 29 cents in Wednesday's extended trading.

Yahoo stock opened lower again at $40.39 on Thursday.

Mayer has been benefiting from a $1 billion investment in Chinese Internet company Alibaba Holding Group that was engineered in 2005 by Terry Semel and Jerry Yang, two former Yahoo CEOs who stepped down as the company's stock plunged.

Yahoo reaped a $7.6 billion windfall by selling a portion of its Alibaba holdings shortly after Mayer took over and still retains a 24 percent stake in the Chinese company. Many investors have been buying Yahoo stock as a way to get a piece of privately held Alibaba, whose revenue and earnings are growing rapidly as it prepares to go public.
