A woman who kept a dozen dogs in 'appalling conditions' inside a tiny caravan where she lived has been banned from keeping animals for 10 years.

Charlotte Richards of no fixed abode, kept the pets in the mobile home, near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, which the RSPCA inspectors described as horrendous.

The 42-year-old pleaded guilty at Kirklees Magistrates Court to two counts of failing to ensure the dogs' welfare and not protecting them from pain, injury, suffering or disease.

Some of the dogs that were kept by Charlotte Richards in a tiny cage inside the caravan where she lived 

The cage where some of the dogs were kept was not kept clean and was littered with dirt and faeces 

RSPCA officers said that when they entered the caravan the smell of dog faeces was overpowering 

The court heard how the dogs, a mixture of terrier cross chihuahuas and dachshunds were kept in a caravan and a garage in Ravensthorpe.

Philip Brown, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, said a man called Andrew Roberts who is related to the defendant allowed her to stay on his property as she had 'accommodation difficulties.'

He said the arrangement was that she could stay in the caravan and bring with her a 'small number of dogs.'

However, Mr Brown said the numbers grew to a maximum of 15.

The pets were kept in such appalling conditions that Richards neglected to clip their claws when they became too long

He added: 'Mr Roberts had his own dogs so he made arrangements to partition the garden area so they could exercise without coming into contact with each other.

'However, he says she would be out of the property for many hours, not returning until midnight or the early hours.

'She would take two to three dogs leaving the other dogs locked in the caravan.

'He didn't have a key so he could not ascertain if they were being properly fed or watered.

'The situation became of increasing concern to him.'

RSPCA officers were greeted with rubbish and excrement when they opened the door to the caravan 

The court heard how Richards became overwhelmed by the number of dogs in her care and was unable to say no to looking after them 

RSPCA inspector Gemma Fowler, attended the property on July 14 last year and after observing conditions in the garage the police forced entry to the caravan.

She described the conditions as 'horrendous' with the smell from the dogs' faeces as overpowering. The dogs were also flea-ridden and suffering from dehydration.

Clive Rees, in mitigation, said his client suffered from depression.

He explained: 'It seems that much of this came about through her goodwill, that she could not say "No" to people, hence the increasing number of dogs she found herself responsible for.

Kashmir Khangura, chairman of the bench, sentenced Richards to a 12-month community order with 30 sessions of activity.

She was also disqualified from keeping all animals for 10 years.

In addition she was told to pay £260 towards the £14,970 costs, most of which was incurred through boarding the animals.

Every week £5 will be taken from her benefits to pay the costs.
