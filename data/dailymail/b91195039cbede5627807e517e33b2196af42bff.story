John Hartson was reunited with Eyal Berkovic in Israel on Friday, 17 years after booting his former West Ham team-mate in the head.

The former Hammers striker kicked Berkovic full in the face  after the Israeli midfielder struck him on the leg during a training ground incident caught on camera back in 1998. 

Remarkably, having since made up following the ugly altercation all those years ago, the pair bumped into each other by chance in a Haifa cafe on Friday.

The former West Ham duo put on a public show of affection for the media a month after the incident

Hartson took to Twitter to share an image of the pair together in the Israeli city and said: 'Just caught up with this little play maker... Nice lunch in Haifa! Mr Berkovic.'

Former Wales international Hartson, who also played for Arsenal, Wimbledon, Coventry and Celtic during a 15-year playing career, is understood to have been giving an interview to an Israeli journalist when Berkovic approached wearing sunglasses.

He is said to have asked his one-time team-mate: 'Recognise me?', before the pair shared words and posed for the picture. 

Speaking to Sportsmail in 2010 about the about the incident, Hartson said: 'The Eyal Berkovic incident really blighted my career. It's something I deeply regret.

'Eyal is a terrific fella and he made a lot of my goals at West Ham. I get asked about it all the time, even though it happened 12 years ago.'
