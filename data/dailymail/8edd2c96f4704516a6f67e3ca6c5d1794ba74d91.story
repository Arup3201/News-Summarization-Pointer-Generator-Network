Battle: France has accused Amazon of being a 'destroyer' of bookshops in new war against internet giants

France has accused Amazon of being a 'destroyer' of bookshops in a new war against internet giants.

The country has launched a battle against the American internet giant.

'Today, everyone has had enough of 
Amazon, which, by dumping, slashes prices to get a foothold in markets 
only to raise them once they have established a virtual monopoly,' 
Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti said reported AFP.

'It is destructive for bookshops,' the minister told a conference of booksellers Monday in the southwestern city of Bordeaux.

Ms Filippetti said that she would be examining measures that could curb Amazon's growth.

One of them could be restricting the American giant's ability to combine offers of free deliveries with discounts on cover prices.

The maximum discount allowed in France under existing legislation is five per cent - this is is designed to protect small booksellers.

Amazon is already firmly on France's radar - last year it received a £159million demand from France for unpaid taxes.

The figure includes fines and interest in relation to 'the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions'.

Amazon has also run into problems with the tax authorities in other countries, with American and Japanese officials both forcing the company to ‘reach an agreement’ on the allocation of the company’s earnings between 2006 and 2012.

The company has also revealed that it is under investigation by the US Internal Revenue Service over its tax returns for the two years from 2005.

The company is also facing demands for taxes dating back to 2003 from countries including China, Germany, and Luxembourg, as well as Britain.

Gaining ground: Amazon has been delivering groceries in their hometown of Seattle for five years but now they are rolling out those services in more cities, immediately including Los Angeles and soon San Francisco

There are also fears in America that Amazon is going to destroy another local type of store - supermarkets.

Amazon is planning a major roll-out of an online grocery business that it has been quietly developing for years.

The online retailer has been delivering food to locals in Seattle, Washington- where the internet giant's headquarters are based- but they announced on Tuesday that they plan to expand the operation to include many more U.S. markets.

It will clearly be a cause for concern in the food industry as brick-and-mortar grocery stores will see their markets threatened by the familiar online store.
