Vowing to clean up was one of the most common New Year's resolutions at the start of 2013. But it would seem many of us are still procrastinating when it comes to keeping up with our household chores.

The average busy Briton currently has 12 jobs which need doing around the house, new research has revealed.

A lack of time, forgetfulness and being daunted by the prospect of starting them are the main reasons that tasks such as cleaning the oven and scouring the bath are languishing on the 'to do' list.

'I'll get around to it': Cleaning our ovens is the top most avoided chore by Britons

'I can't face it': It seems the prospect of beginning task puts us off starting them, sometimes postponing it for years

Other 'get round to it' jobs include removing hair from plugholes, sorting through the fridge and wiping skirting boards.

With 12 jobs needing attention in every house, that means a staggering 316 million 'little household jobs' are waiting to be carried out around the UK.

Yesterday a spokesman for Oven Pride, which carried out the research, said: 'We all lead such hectic modern lives that it's sometimes hard to keep on top of everything.

'Of course the longer you leave a job, 
the worse it usually is when you finally get round to facing it, but 
making sure you have the right tools for the job can make household 
chores less of a nightmare.

When it comes down to it, the thought of doing a job you've put off is usually a lot worse than actually getting it done.'

'I'm too busy!':We blame not doing chores like touching up scuffed walls on our modern busy lifestyles

The dreaded task of cleaning the oven emerged as the most hated chore of all.

Half
of the 2,000 people studied admitted they struggle with the nightmare 
of maintaining a modern home while balancing work and family life.

1.      Cleaning the oven

2.      Cleaning the windows

3.      Painting walls - touching up scratches/marks

4.      Dusting

5.      Vacuuming the stairs

6.      Sorting out a bedroom cupboard

7.      Defrosting the freezer

8.      Cleaning the skirting boards

9.      Moving furniture to clean behind

10.    Hoovering under the sofa cushions

11.    Cleaning cooker hoods

12.    Organising the garage

13.    Mowing the lawn

14.    De-scaling the kettle

15.    Cleaning the bathroom

16.    Cleaning out the fridge

17.    Painting a fence

18.    Ironing shirts

19.    Cleaning the toilet

20.    Scouring the bath

And the same number have a job they know they should tackle but have tried to forget it completely rather than attempt it.

Cleaning cooker hoods, descaling the kettle and dusting make the list of jobs that are most commonly avoided.

While the prospect of having to iron shirts dampens the spirit for many and features inside the top twenty most disliked chores.

A defeated 55 per cent of people have attempted a chore but found it so daunting or difficult that they've abandoned it mid-way.

A tenth of people have a job at home that they've put off doing for over five years.

While three in ten have put a job off for at least a year or two.

And a cheeky 48 per cent actively avoid doing a job in the hopes their partner will do it for them.

But a stressed out 45 per cent of people admit to being kept awake at night over a job that they haven't been able to cross off the to-do list.

But a visit from the mother-in-law spurs one in ten to conquer their cleaning while one in four can no longer put it off if it starts ruining the look of a room.

And an all or nothing one in five say their approach is to let things mount up for a few weeks before tackling it all in one massive spruce up.

The Oven Pride spokesperson added: 'The results show it's not uncommon to put off a job even for years at a time.

'What's important to consider though is whether leaving these things will impact the quality of your lifestyle or bring about long term damage that might cost you in the long run.'
