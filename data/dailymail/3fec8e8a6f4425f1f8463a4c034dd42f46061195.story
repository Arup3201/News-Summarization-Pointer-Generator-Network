A statewide manhunt is on for the daughter of slain San Francisco porn mogul Artie Mitchell after she rammed a police car when officers attempted to arrest her in a sting operation.

Authorities say 33-year-old Jasmine Mitchell is on the run and considered 'dangerous and desperate', wanted in relation to a major identity theft operation that has claimed thousands of victims.

On April 29, detectives received information that Mitchell and a second suspect, 34-year-old Roy Kim were living at an apartment complex across from the San Pablo Lytton Casino, according to Inside Bay Area.

Both had arrest warrants against their names, and police detained three people after searching the apartment and finding a large-scale identity theft and credit card operation.

The siblings produced the 1972 hardcore classic Behind the Green Door and owned a well-known San Francisco strip club called the O'Farrell Theater.

In 1991 Mitchell's uncle fatally shot her father. 

In 2000, their story was dramatized in the movie Rated X starring real life brothers Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez.

Inside Jasmine's apartment, detectives said they seized evidence of stolen credit card information, as well as equipment, such as an embossing machine and a card press.

Police will allege she used the equipment to make fake credit cards from stolen identities.

Authorities plan to seek additional charges of hit-and-run and assault with a deadly weapon for her getaway.
