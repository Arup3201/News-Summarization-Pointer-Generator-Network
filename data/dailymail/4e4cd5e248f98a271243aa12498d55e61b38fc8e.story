An Episcopal priest has been yanked from post after being accused of directly plagiarizing sermons he gave and even published in his own name since 2006.

Rev. John McGinn, 65, led the congregation of St. John’s Episcopal in the Cape Cod town of Sandwich, Massachusetts since 1993. That is, until recently when he was put on administrative leave for allegedly stealing sermons.

They came, nearly verbatim, from a book called ‘Dynamic Preaching’ that is only available via an online subscription service at Sermons.com.

Thou shalt not steal: From the tiny St. John's Episcopal Church Father John McGinn (pictured) gave sermons for years that he likely cribbed straight from Sermons.com

The 300 or so families who normally attend McGinn’s sermons in the little wood-shingled village church received a letter May 9 from the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts explaining what exactly had become of their spiritual guide.

‘This is a serious breach of the pastoral relationship between John and each of you,’ wrote Bishop M. Thomas Shaw. ‘I am sorry that this matter has caused pain and will likely cause further pain in the parish.’

McGinn first raised the eyebrows of church elders a year ago when officials approached him with similar accusations. However, friar assured them it was an isolated incident that would not happen again.

‘We investigated further,’ wrote Shaw, ‘and have documentation that  not only did he continue to copy sermons and preach and publish them verbatim, in print and online, as his own, but he had been doing so for many years.’

Parish the thought: McGinn led the congregation at St. John's in the Cape Cod town of Sandwich, Massachusetts since 1993 but was recently placed on administrative leave

As an example, the Diocese pointed to a December 2011 sermon given by McGinn in which he told a detailed story about a man who had ‘Jingle Bells’ sung at his funeral instead of ‘Glory Bells.’

The same story, investigators found, had been used at other churches before. Meanwhile, the opening line of McGinn’s version includes an aside about just how unbelievable some of his supposedly true tales can seem.

‘I keep saying that one of these days I'm going to sit down and write a book because some of the things that have happened in my ministry need to be written down so that people can read them,’ he said in the sermon, which was still on the church’s sermon as of Friday.

Pilfered preaching: The Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts says McGinn has been stealing sermons word-for-word since at least 2006

Rev. Mally Lloyd of the Diocese office said there were other instances. As many as 15, according to the Cape Cod Times.

And McGinn, says Shaw, isn’t denying any of it.

‘He admits to having done so,’ he wrote. The diocese is now ‘working out a final agreement’ with the priest.

So what becomes of a shamed priest after many years in the cloth? Not a tortured existence, it appears.

‘I'm going to retire,’ the unabashed McGinn said. ‘I loved my time at the parish. That's all. I think I did a good job.’

C'est la vivum: McGinn reportedly admitted to the plagiarism. 'I'm going to retire,' he said. 'I think I did a good job'
