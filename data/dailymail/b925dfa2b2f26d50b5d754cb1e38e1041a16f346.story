The decision not to press charges over the deaths of three soldiers who collapsed during an SAS training exercise was correct, prosecutors have confirmed.

Edward Maher, Craig Roberts and James Dunsby died of heat exhaustion on the Brecon Beacons  after a 40-mile hike as part of a gruelling training exercise in July 2013.

The Crown Prosecution Service were reviewing charges of gross negligence manslaughter but found 'insufficient evidence' to provide a 'realistic prospect of conviction'.

Corporal James Dunsby was among three soldiers that died after taking part in a training exercise on the Brecon Beacons in July 2013, when temperatures reached 29C

Prosecutors announced its initial decision not to press charges in July last year, but it is understood they were asked to re-examine the case by two of the soldiers' families.

They were among 100 men taking part in a four-week trial for the Territorial Army's SAS reservists on Pen Y Fan, when temperatures hit 29C on July 13, 2013 - one of the hottest days of the year.

Lance Corporal Roberts, 24, of Penrhyn Bay, Conwy, was pronounced dead on the mountainside, while Lance Corporal Maher and Corporal Dunsby, both 31, were taken to hospital.

L/Cpl Maher died three hours later in Merthyr Tydfil's Prince Charles Hospital, while Cpl Dunsby, from Bath, was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and died on July 30.

L/Cpl Roberts, who had served with the TA for more than five years and nicknamed 'CJ' by family, was a member of the 3rd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment.

He is believed to have served as a reservist in Iraq and Afghanistan and with United Nations peacekeepers in Cyprus.

L/Cpl Maher had served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Edward, known as Eddie to friends, served his country in Iraq and Afghanistan in an elite special reserve unit often behind enemy lines. 

Cpl Dunsby was a member of the Army Reserves (The Royal Yeomanry).

The Brecon Beacons are a notoriously inhospitable area for army training operations and are used by both regular units and the special forces. 

A spokesman for the prosecution service said: 'The CPS Appeals and Review Unit has completed a review of the case relating to the tragic deaths of soldiers on the Brecon Beacons in July 2013. 

'This review was requested under our Victims' Right to Review scheme.

'Case reviews completed under the Victims' Right to Review scheme involve a completely independent assessment of the available evidence against the evidential and public interest standards set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors.

'In this case, our review concluded that the original decision not to charge any individual in respect of this matter was correct. There is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction in this case.

'The families involved have been informed of this decision and the reasons for it. Our thoughts remain with them.' 

A large amount of detailed material, including reports provided by expert witnesses, was considered during the original review of the evidence, the CPS said.

It is believed that two of the soldiers' families asked for the charges of gross negligence manslaughter to be reviewed. The CPS found 'insufficient evidence' to provide a 'realistic prospect of conviction'

A Dyfed Powys Police spokesperson said: 'Following a joint police and Health and Safety Executive investigation into the events leading to the tragic deaths of three soldiers on the Brecon Beacons in July 2013, files of evidence were submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service for review, who concluded that that there is insufficient evidence to support charges of gross negligence manslaughter.

'All families have been informed of the decision and police will continue to support them.

'Police will continue to support the Health and Safety Executive who continue with their investigation into the deaths. A file will be prepared for the coroner.' 

An inquest in to the deaths of soldiers was delayed after senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, Louise Hunt, ruled last September that a full inquest could not take place until after the CPS review of the deaths.

The inquest, expected to last for up to three weeks, was rescheduled to begin on June 1.

It is expected to hear from soldiers who were manning checkpoints at the time of the training exercise and other military personnel involved in its management.
