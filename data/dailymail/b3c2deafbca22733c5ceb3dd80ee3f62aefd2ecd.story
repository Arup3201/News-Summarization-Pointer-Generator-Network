Police say a two-year-old boy playing in the front yard of an Indiana home with his seven-year-old sister may have been fatally struck by a bullet from a gunfight between two rival gangs about a block away.

Officers suspect an argument began between the two groups around 6pm Wednesday a half-mile south of the University of Notre Dame, about a block from where two-year-old John Swoveland, Jr was playing in South Bend.

One group is believed to have run west toward the boy and the other group continued shooting at them.

No arrests have been made and no suspects are in custody.

Police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

'I'm tired of coming to see kids dead in the street,' Lieutenant David Wells told Fox 28.

'I'm just tired of it, so people need to band together and get with the program and start calling us, calling us at Homicide, with information. You don't even have to leave your name. I'm not even going to ask your name.'

According to Fox 28, Metro Homicide officers believe two rival gangs exchanged gunfire near Arthur and Campeau Steets.

One group ran west to escape the 
other, and a stray bullet hit and killed the toddler in the front yard 
of his aunt's home where he was playing.

Police
 also discovered a second shooting scene near Arthur and Campeau Streets
 a few blocks east of Eddy Street, where there was evidence of gunfire, 
but no one was known to be injured.

The little boy's mother has been named as Ashley Kinder, 23. She is currently expecting another child. Before John Swoveland, Jr's birth Kinder suffered another tragedy when her baby daughter died of natural causes at just nine days old.

The boy's father John Swoveland was in the house at the time of the shooting.

'I didn't see nothing.  I was, just went inside to get, to get my girlfriend's attention for her to come outside and play with us and I, my hand on the door still my little girl comes inside and says someone just drove by and shot my son, and I walked outside and my son's all white and he's just laying on the ground all messed up,' Swoveland told Fox28.

Prosecutors say the autopsy on John Swoveland, Jr. Is complete. The forensic pathologist found the cause of death to be a gunshot wound to the chest and the manner of death to be homicide.
