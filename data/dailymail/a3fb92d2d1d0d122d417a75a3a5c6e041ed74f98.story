Ebola scare cases are sweeping the nation, with more than 100 potential victims reported to authorities by hospitals in the last few days.

Health workers are on high alert for anybody with links to West Africa - where the disease has killed thousands - who show Ebola-like symptoms, which include vomiting, bleeding and diarrhea.

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has been deluged by reports of potential sufferers - but so far none have turned out to be genuine Ebola victims.

Fears: Officers hand out facemasks at Newark Liberty Airport today, where it was feared a passenger had Ebola. It later turned out he did not

Confirmed case: Thomas Duncan, pictured right just after he landed in the U.S. last month, is the country's first confirmed Ebola victim - and is in a critical condition in a Dallas hospital

Precautions: Hazmat teams descended on apartments where Duncan had stayed on disinfect items including his car (pictured). As many as 100 other patients have been flagged up by hospitals across the country

High alert: Medical workers are being especially vigilant and screening as many people as possible for Ebola who have come from West Africa and display symptoms

Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who flew into the country in late September, remains the only person in the United States to have the disease.

The 42-year-old is currently in a critical condition in a Dallas Hospital. A total of 49 people who could potential have caught Ebola from Duncan are being monitored by CDC experts. None have shown symptoms so far.

Today Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, said the rush of potential cases came after news of Duncan's infection spread to hospitals, who have been especially vigilant.

The first Ebola diagnosis in the United States 'has really
increased attention to what health workers need to do to be
alert and make sure a travel history is taken,' Frieden told a
news conference.

Frieden added that many of the inquiries involved people who
had not traveled from West Africa, but that the agency preferred
healthcare workers to cast as wide a net as possible.

Duncan, now being treated at Texas Health Presbyterian
Hospital, was sent home after his first visit to the emergency
room, despite telling a nurse there that he had just been to
Liberia.

The governments of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are
struggling to contain the worst outbreak on record of the deadly
hemorrhagic fever.

The World Health Organization on Friday updated its death
toll to at least 3,439 out of 7,492 suspected, probable or
confirmed cases.

On Friday, officials said the number of people placed under
isolation in Dallas after possible exposure to Duncan had grown
to at least 10, including four members of a family moved to an
undisclosed house for close monitoring.

Initially, 100 people had been feared to have had direct or
indirect contact. All those in isolation were cooperating with
public health authorities by staying in quarantine voluntarily,
according to Dallas city and county officials.

'There's no one under orders. There's no one that we
perceive that needs to be under orders,' Judge Clay Jenkins,
Dallas County's top elected official, told a news conference
late on Friday.

Separately, five public school children who had possibly
been exposed to the Ebola patient had been kept home from class
in recent days while being monitored as a precaution, though
none had shown any symptoms, said Mike Miles, superintendent of
the Dallas Independent School District.

Authorities did not identify the individuals placed in
isolation but said they included the four members of a single
family whose apartment Duncan was staying in when he fell ill
after traveling to Dallas from Liberia on September 19.
