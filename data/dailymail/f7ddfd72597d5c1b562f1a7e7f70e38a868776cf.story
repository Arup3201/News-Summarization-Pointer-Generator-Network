Remember the term 'Normcore'? We reported on it a couple of months ago - the bland fashion uniform consisting of plain
tees, comfortable shoes, understated anoraks and dad jeans?

Just
 got your fuzzy fashion head around that? Well sorry to break it to you,
 but it's already old news in the fast-paced and fickle world of 
fashion, where buzzwords come and go quicker than you can say Cara 
Delevingne.

The latest trend to be embracing? That would be #CozyGirl, which comes complete with a hashtag because it originated on Instagram, where fashion's elite set the seasonal trends.

New trend: The latest style craze to sweep social media is the #CozyGirl trend, which Cara Delevingne models to perfection (think joggers, comfy T-shirts and trainers)

#CozyGirl involves combining streetwear with comfy pyjama style clothes - think cashmere jumpers, sweatpants and trainers or pool sliders.

It takes the sportswear trend a step further and the trendsetters are pairing grey jogging bottoms with slouchy T-shirts and jumpers and slipping on Saucony trainers (the only footwear to be seen in this season).

Refinery 29's Bobby Schuessler, who spotted the trend, said: 'They live life on the corner where fashion and comfort meet. And, with the rise of high-concept sweatpants, slides, pullovers, and more in the women’s space, it seems the #cozygirl movement is on the rise.'

Speaking about the trend, MailOnline's resident fashion blogger, Simon Glazin, said: 'I absolutely love this look, it's cool, effortless and can actually be quite chic. Look to Victoria Beckham with her various looser fit trousers, relaxed T-shirts and waterfall, sleeveless jackets. She wore a couple of looks like this which were uber comfy and cool.

Smartening up: Miranda Kerr rocked elasticated waistband joggers in her H&M campaign but added heels and a blazer to take her look from day to night

'However you have to make sure you don't become a fashion victim. We don't actually want to see your pyjamas, and make sure if you are going out head-to-toe in slouchy pieces you give yourself some shape - maybe tuck in your Tee or shirt? Simple but makes a difference.

'There are lots of cosy chic looks from the catwalks of late. Vionnet for SS14 styled up a gorgeous maxi skirt with a plain white T-shirt. Blake Lively rocked this exact look at Cannes earlier this year.

'Elasticated waists are now OK. They are no longer just reserved for old age homes. Try a pair of heels with joggers for a fierce-girl look, for instance. It's all about having a bit of fun with your wardrobe, and trying to look like you haven't tried at all!'

Style blogger Toni Jones, founder of 30ishStylist.com, is yet to be convinced.

She said: 'Recently I bought a pair of sports luxe "cosy girl" joggers from H&M, as seen on Miranda Kerr in the billboard campaign. Miranda looked hot to trot in her loose pants and heels. I appeared to gain two stone the second I put them on. And this is my problem with "cosy" fashion wear - you need to be stunning and super slim to make it look cool.

'I'm a big fan of dressing according to your shape and most of these clothes assume we have no shape, which is pretty unrealistic at best and complete fashion snobbery at worst.

'I like - and wear - some of the simple pieces worn with something a bit more glamorous that will work harder for me and my hips, but as a rule I vote that #CozyGirl should stay under the duvet where she belongs.'
