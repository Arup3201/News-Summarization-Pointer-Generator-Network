Arthur Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times, said on Saturday that executive editor Jill Abramson left the paper 'for reasons having nothing to do with pay or gender.'

'During her tenure, I heard repeatedly from her newsroom colleagues, women and men, about a series of issues, including arbitrary decision-making, a failure to consult and bring colleagues with her, inadequate communication and the public mistreatment of colleagues,' Sulzberger said in a statement.

'I discussed these issues with Jill herself several times and warned her that, unless they were addressed, she risked losing the trust of both masthead and newsroom,' he said.

Sulzberger said he and Abramson spoke about the problems, but 'the gap was too big to bridge.'

He also said that her pay was 'comparable' to that of Bill Keller, who served as the paper's executive editor from 2003 to 2011.

'Jill’s pay package was comparable with Bill Keller’s; in fact, by her last full year as executive editor, it was more than 10% higher than his,' Sulzberger said in the statement.

Sulzberger earlier wrote in a Thursday memo that the firing stemmed from 'concerns I had about some aspects of Jill's management,' the Times reported.

A spokeswoman for the the paper told Times reporter Ravi Somaya 'We're comfortable with this statement' after pressed about a non-disparagement clause.

Last week The New Yorker alleged that Abramson was fired after she found out 'several weeks ago' that her pay was lower than Keller's after a series of issues with Times management.

The magazine said that she may have been deemed '"pushy," a characterization that, for many, has an inescapably gendered aspect.'

The 'pushy' description seemed to spill over into the Instagram account of Abramson's daughter, Cornelia Griggs.

On Thursday, she shared an image of Abramson wearing boxing gloves and standing next to a punching bag with the caption 'Mom's badass new hobby #girls #pushy.'

A Friday upload from Griggs included a screen grab of a text message conversation that appears to be between Griggs and an unidentified woman, with the caption 'Big thank you to all the #pushy #bossy #polarizing women and men who get it. The story isn't over, not even close.'
