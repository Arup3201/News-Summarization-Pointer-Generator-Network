An Army officer returning home after a year long deployment in Qatar gave his two young children the surprise of their lives.

Siblings Daniel and Danica Huff were attending a school assembly at the Beaufort Elementary School in Missouri on Monday, when they were told to come forward to receive a 'special prize' in front of their classmates.

Little did they know that the prize was being reunited with their dad, U.S. Army Sgt. Daniel Huff, who had been deployed since last August.

Scroll down for video.

A prize, for me? The school's principal invited Danica and Daniel Huff onstage during a school assembly to receive a special prize

Standing onstage, the siblings looked peaceful and calm ... that is 
until their father slipped in through stage left and the brother and sister erupted in excitement.

Huff's little girl, Danica, could hardly contain herself when she spotted 
her daddy, waving her arms and jumping for joy as the Army officer 
walked onstage and gathered up the two youngsters in his arms, in a YouTube video that makes your heart melt.

Their mom, Michelle, joined the family onstage, wiping tears from her eyes as 
she observed the touching scene - simply overwhelmed with emotion at the 
reunion.

Huff, a Military Police officer, had been stationed in Qatar since last August.

That's my daddy! Danica Huff cannot contain her excitement when she realizes the prize is to see her dad

Yeah! The Huff siblings run to hug their dad, who had been deployed in Qatar for a year

He came home for two weeks leave over Christmas but had otherwise not seen his little ones.

The Army soldier had actually returned home to the U.S. from the Middle East on Sunday but decided to wait to surprise his children at school the next day, in a carefully crafted plan organized by his wife and the school's principal, Mark Spann.

'Mr. Spann pulled Danica's name from a basket and told her she won a surprise and said that Daniel needed to help her with it,' the mom explained.

After the heartwarming homecoming, Mr Spann asked Huff to stay onstage to
explain to the elementary school children about his work in the military.

'I
have been deployed with the United States Army for the last year,' he told 
the crowd at the school in Beaufort, Missouri, as his 
two children proudly looked on.

'I'm not anybody special. I'm just a Military Police officer. I went to a
small country called Qatar ... it's about the size of Connecticut,' the
humble Huff said.

'I stood at the gate to make sure the people coming onto the post were 
supposed to come onto the post. That's all I did, nothing special.'

Tears of joy: Mom, Michelle, wipes away tears as her children are reunited with their dad

Awww: After the outburst of joy, Danica Huff looks shy as her dad speaks to her classmates about his deployment

This was his fourth trip overseas during his nearly 15 year career as a member of the Missouri National Guard.

Though Huff tried to downplay his service, the school's principal was 
not having it and praised the father-of-two for being on the front 
lines.

'You said you weren't anyone special but I disagree' Spann said.

'I think everyone should give him a round of applause, he's pretty 
special,' as the audience stood and clapped for the returned veteran.

'We're thankful for your service. We appreciate everything you do,' he added.Â 

Friends of the Huffs took to Facebook and YouTube to join in the excitement surrounding Huff's return.

'Awesome! This is an answer to many prayers for you and your fellow military personnel to be home safe,' one friend wrote, adding, 'God Bless you and Michelle, she has done an amazing job over the last year making sure the kids know and learn to have a passion and appreciation for what others take for granted everyday.'

By Wednesday, the YouTube clip had already garnered nearly 5,000 views on the video sharing website after just three days.
