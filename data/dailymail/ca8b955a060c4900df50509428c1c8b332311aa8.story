A pickpocket's victim decided to take revenge by sticking a sign reading 'I am a thief' to the criminal's back, who was then pictured as he tried to steal from others.

Chinese police confirmed they are investigating after the bus passenger, who has not been named, took several pictures of the pickpocket attempting to steal from other unsuspecting people. 

The pictures were posted online last week after being taken in the city of Yulin in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, The People's Daily reported.

Unaware of the sign on his back, the thief is pictured with his hand covertly placed in a backpack belonging to a man waiting at a bus stop.

Having found nothing of value, he is then seen switching his attention to a black bag hanging off the young man's shoulder. 

After the pictures went viral, police confirmed that they were aware of the matter.

A police spokesman said they were investigating and trying to track down the victim, the photographer and the alleged thief.

Ye Chung, of Yulin city police, said: 'We were already aware of these images circulating, and I can confirm that we are trying to track down those involved so that we can get to the truth of the matter. 

'We are in particular appealing for anybody who knows the alleged thief to contact us and identify him, but we also need to speak to the suspected victim who had been waiting for the bus and if possible the person who took the pictures.'

The pictures were uploaded online without any comment. It is unclear why the victim did not report the matter to police at the same time as taking the pictures.
