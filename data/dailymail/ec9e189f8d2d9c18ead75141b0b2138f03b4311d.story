This is the moment a hero schoolboy was stabbed to death by a gang of gatecrashers as he tried to defend his friend at a birthday party.

Brave Ben Morutare, 16, died from a single knife wound to the leg in a brutal attack in the early hours of July 27 last year.

Ben, who had just finished his GCSE exams, was one of 230 guests at the party which celebrated a friend’s 18th birthday and another pal’s 17th birthday.

Final moments: seconds after this CCTV footage was recorded Ly bundled Ben off camera and delivered a single fatal stab wound which severed an artery in his leg

Heroic: Ben became involved in the fighting while trying to protect friends from attackers

Deadly: Ly reemerges having delivered the blow which killed Ben

But violence erupted after 30 gatecrashers turned up and started fighting with revellers when the party finished.

Today six members of the gang who hunted him down, armed with knives, were jailed for a total of 23 years.

After the case harrowing footage of the schoolboy’s final moments was released by West Midlands Police who described the crime as 'despicable.'

Ly, a student from Ladywood, was sentenced to seven years in jail for manslaughter in July last year after FBI-enhanced CCTV footage was used to
catch him

Officers travelled to the USA to use FBI techniques to enhance the quality of the footage and help snare Ben’s killer.

The images show the moment Andy Ly, 18, from Birmingham, delivers the fatal blow in the street which severed Ben’s artery.

Investigating officer Det Insp Gary Plant
said Ben’s family had given their permission to show the video, in the 
hope of preventing another family suffering a similar loss.

He said: 'Carrying a knife can have deadly consequences and we are continuing to target people who are involved in crimes involving bladed weapons.

Unemployed Dale Reid, 18, pleaded guilty to violent disorder and was sentenced to 28 months

'Possessing a knife not only risks others but heightens your risk of becoming a victim.

'Ben came to aid of a number of friends who had been attacked by a mob, to do that was really courageous and it is so sad that a young brave lost his life in the way that he did.'

Ben and his friends had gone to the social club in Smethwick, West Mids., after seeing the party advertised on social media.

There, an argument broke out in the foyer as other guests took offence to having people from neighbouring Walsall there.

Pushing and shoving turned into violence as the groups moved into the street outside.

While several men chased down one of Ben’s friends, beating him and robbing him of his bag, others chased Ben into a nearby street.

After being stabbed Zimbabwe-born Ben, from Walsall, was rushed to hospital but he had lost too much blood, and nothing could be done to save him.

Student Ly admitted manslaughter and violent disorder seven weeks into a 10-week trial and was yesterday jailed for seven years.

Five others were also convicted of an array of violent disorder offences, as well as possession of offensive weapons.

Tahj Mills, 19, from West Bromwich, West Mids., was convicted of violent disorder and jailed for three and a half years.

Following the verdicts, Ben’s mother Grace, 42, told how the family had been torn apart by the pain of losing her son.

She said: 'You would think that with time the pain of losing our Ben would get a bit easier but it’s been the toughest time of our lives, the fact that we will never see Ben again is the most painful and unbearable thought.

'No family should go through what we have gone through. We will always love and miss our Ben dearly.'
