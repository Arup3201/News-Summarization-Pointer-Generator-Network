She really put her leg into LEGO!

Christina Stephens lower leg and foot had to be amputated after a car she was rebuilding fell and crushed it.

Despite the traumatic injury, Christina decided to get creative and made a prosthetic out of LEGO blocks that were laying around in her basement.

How it all begins: Christina Stephens with her regular prosthetic and notice the box of LEGOs to the left

No instructions here: The prosthetic off, Christina sets about building a new leg made from LEGOs

Progress: With the box of LEGOs all over the floor, Christina sets about building the toy limb

It fits: The LEGO bricks seems to fit perfectly around Christina's stump

Ms Stephens, an occupational therapist and clinical researcher based in St. Louis, Missouri, said she decided to build the toy leg after a co-worker proposed the idea as a joke.

'I liked the idea, because I am very comfortable with my body and like encouraging others to be more comfortable with theirs,' she told ABC News.

As she set about creating the plastic limb, she recorded a video to document her work.

In the time-lapse video, Ms Stephens is seen dumping out crate after crate of Lego blocks and sorting through them as she builds, fits and tests her own prosthetic leg.

Caring: Christina has launched a Facebook page where she shares videos, resources and healthcare information for other amputees and caregivers

The final piece: Christina attaches the foot and ankle that she has built

Feeling pleased with herself: Finally the leg is complete and Christina is surely worthy of the title of LEGO 'Masterbuilder'

The moment of truth: After two days, Christina completes building her leg and gingerly tests whether it will take her weight

Whoops! The ankle and foot do have a tendency to snap off now and again!

Nothing afoot here: The foot can easily be reattached with minimal effort

Passion for engineering: Christina lost her leg when she was fixing a car and it crushed it but she still loves getting her toolbox or box of LEGOs out!

Near the end of video – which runs just under six minutes – she stands up on her multi-coloured prosthesis and cautiously steps on it a few times.

The film which is set to music is sped up in order to condense the two day building blitz into just under six minutes.

She says that it only took about two hours to fit the LEGO limb to her leg.

The video has received nearly 325,000 views on YouTube. She has also launched a Facebook page where she shares videos, resources and healthcare information for other amputees and caregivers.

She says although the leg is colorful and comfortable, it's not completely practical.

The ankle and foot tend occasionally snap off, but all it takes is a click to put it back together. As a result, she can walk for only short distances on it.

Christina warns her viewers that the Lego prosthetic is not actually meant to be used.

'Please don’t do this yourself. I don’t want you to fall and get hurt!' she said. 'Sometimes you just need to be silly.'

Side by side: Christina says the LEGO leg isn't particularly practical or comfortable but is proud she accepted the challenge

Ms Stephens says she is planning 'Lego Leg 2.0,' on which the ankle and foot will be far more functional.

Either way, there's no doubt her positive outlook on life ensured that her creativity prospers.

'I like having this extra space below my stump that other people don’t have that I can explore,' Stephens said. 'It makes me feel superhuman.
