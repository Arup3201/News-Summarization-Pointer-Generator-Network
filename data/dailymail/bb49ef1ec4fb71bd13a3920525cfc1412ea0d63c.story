Proud grandfather: Bill Cassidy, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senator from Louisiana, has announced that his 17-year-old daughter is having a baby out of wedlock

A conservative Louisiana Republican seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu announced Thursday that his unwed 17-year-old daughter is pregnant.

Bill Cassidy, a U.S. congressman and medical doctor, is challenging Landrieu, a three-term incumbent, in a race that Republicans view as important in their quest to reclaim the U.S. Senate from Democrats.

'Earlier this year, Laura and I learned we will become grandparents this summer,' Cassidy said in a statement provided to the Times-Picayune of New Orleans. 'Our children have been the greatest blessing of our lives and we welcome our grandchild as a joyous addition to our family. 

'Our daughter now faces a more challenging future than her peers. She has our unconditional love and support.'

The 17-year-old mother-to-be will be a senior in Baton Rouge High School in the fall. The baby is due sometime this summer.

The Cassidy campaign did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

Bill Cassidy is a physician specializing in the treatment of liver disease. His wife, Laura Layden, is a retired breast cancer surgeon. The couple have three children: a son and two teenage daughters.

His campaign website states that Cassidy 'works to promote the culture of life and protect the unborn.' 

Cassidy and Mary Landrieu, the senior U.S. senator from Louisiana, have clashed over the issue of abortion in the course of the campaign.

Landrieu publicly criticized a law restricting abortion rights that was signed by Gov Bobby Jindal last month, Politico reported.

The centrist Democrat explained that she has a nuanced position on the subject of abortions with the voting record to prove it.

‘I’ve voted against late-term abortion, I voted for access in the … pre-viability [period],’ she said. ‘Although I personally believe that life begins at conception, I believe the last place the government needs to be is in the church, in the doctor’s office or in the bedroom.’

But Bill Cassidy has disputed his opponent's position, painting her as a pro-choice candidate.

‘She has supported using U.S. taxpayer dollars for overseas abortions and most folks, even if they are pro-choice, don’t care for that,’ Cassidy said.

On his part, Cassidy has backed a bill passed in the Congress that bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy on the federal level.

In a recent interview, the Senate hopeful described Louisiana as a 'pro-life' state where most of the constituents are Catholics and evangelicals who support the rights of the unborn.
