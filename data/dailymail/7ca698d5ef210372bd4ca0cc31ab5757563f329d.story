Former President Bill Clinton has apologized to Mexico during a speech in which he suggests that the U.S. war on drugs has been responsible for fueling escalating violence.

Clinton spoke at the Laureate Summit on Youth and Productivity in Mexico where he told the audience that the war had backfired and led to violence which is crippling the country.

He said: 'I wish you had no narco-trafficking, but it's not really your fault. Basically, we did too good of a job of taking the transportation out of the air and water, and so we ran it over land. I apologize for that.'

The Clinton administration took on old drugs policies enacted by his predecessors, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, according to The Huntington Post. 

In 1989, President George H.W. Bush doubled his annual drug-war spending to $12 billion and committed the military to the cause.

Meanwhile efforts were made to shut down the Caribbean Sea as the favored trafficking route between the U.S. and South America and Central America. 

But it is this effort which pushed smuggling west, over land in Mexico.

In addition, Clinton's administration opened Mexico's border with the U.S. which encouraged land-based trafficking, and enforcement efforts that broke up Colombian cartels.

This empowered Mexican drug gangs, who increased in power although they had largely been middle men.

However as the money flowed in it's led to horrific acts of violence. 

At present, the U.S. government spends roughly $40 billion to $50 billion each year fighting the war on drugs around the world. 

The battle has taken a particularly devastating toll in Mexico. 

Over the past few years, at least 60,000 to 100,000 people are believed to have been murdered in Mexico, many in drug-related violence. 

There are estimated to be two murders a day, horrific kidnappings and no-go areas in some parts of the country where the police can struggle to maintain order.

Mexico's half-dozen powerful and violent cartels carry out breathtakingly gruesome kidnappings and violence against rivals.

Citizens continually voice their concern over the high level of violence among the cartels and  corruption within the government.

This has, once again, come to the fore since 43 missing students from rural Mexico were ruled to have been killed and incinerated after being seized by state law enforcement.

Parents of the college students have angrily rejected the Mexican attorney general's declaration that their children were murdered. 

They say that there is a cover up in an attempt to resolve the situation quickly.  

Last year, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico issued a security warning to U.S. citizens to avoid the Pacific resort of Acapulco because of the violence and protests over the students disappearance.

Over the past few years, at least 60,000 to 100,000 people are believed to have been murdered in Mexico, many in drug-related violence.

And despite the U.S. war on drugs, 90 percent of the cocaine that arrives in America travels through Mexico and Central America, according to a recent State Department report. 

Cartels also continue to deliver a significant amount of heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine into the U.S.
