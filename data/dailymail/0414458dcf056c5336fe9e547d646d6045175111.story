A man who shot dead a young father  days after the birth of his baby daughter has been found guilty of murder.

John 'Boy' Ward, 33, shot Thomas Ward, 21, who was the son of his cousin, at a caravan site in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, over a long-standing family feud.

The court heard the murderer had phoned his victim in 2011 and told him: 'It's me, your enemy. I'm going to wait until you are at your happiest - then I'm going to get you.' 

Thomas Ward's wife Theresa gave birth to his daughter five days before he was killed on 23 April 2013.

A window of his caravan was smashed while the couple and their daughter were asleep.

Opening the door with just a piece of kitchen cutlery for protection, Thomas was confronted by three masked men, one armed with a 12 gauge shotgun in April last year.

With his wife standing behind him, he was shot in the chest and died less than an hour later in hospital. 

John Price QC, prosecuting, told the jury at St Albans Crown Court: 'Thomas Ward was the victim of an execution.' 

Clips of the funeral were shown on Channel 4's My Big Fat Gypsy Christening in October 2013.

On the programme, his father, James 'Young Fox' Ward said: 'They shot him in a cold blooded murder. The police officer said at the time that it was an assassination. He never had a chance.'

The trial heard the feud began when Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward, was held responsible by some family members for the death of his cousin Micky Ward in a car crash in 1987.

Six years later James Ward shot dead Micky's brother James 'Bimbo' Ward and was jailed for manslaughter.

John 'Boy' Ward was the younger brother of the two dead men.

On the Channel 4 programme, James 'Young Fox' Ward said: 'I had an argument 20 odd years ago with a cousin and he died subsequently in the fight and I went to prison for it. 

'Why did they not kill me, I don't understand.'  

Thomas had not been born when the feud began, but Mr Price, prosecuting, said: 'To John Ward, it was immaterial - Thomas Ward shared the sins of his father.'

The trial heard the feud started when Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward (pictured left) was held responsible by some family members for the death of his cousin in a car crash in 1987 - his father said he did not understand why his son (pictured right) was killed instead of him 

Following the shooting John 'Boy' Ward, from Hatfield, used a fake passport to travel on Eurostar to Brussels.

His wife Joeleen, who was five months pregnant, then flew out from East Midlands Airport to meet him in Paris.

They went on the run, travelling around France and Spain before settling in Helsingor in Denmark. 

Giving evidence during his trial, John 'Boy' Ward said he had panicked and fled after the shooting because he knew he would be blamed.  

He said he was scared to return to the UK because he'd heard there was a £100,000 'contract' out on him.

He said: 'I heard there was a contract put on my head. £50,000 to find where I was and £50,000 to kill me.'

Hundreds of travellers attended the funeral of Thomas Ward, who was shot by John 'Boy' Ward

Joeleen Ward, 22 – who was also on trial with her husband accused of helping him to escape – said her child had been born while they were on the run together in Europe.

In the witness box she sobbed and spoke of her fears for her son's future safety because of the family feud.

'I'm still scared for my son growing up,' she told the jury.

She was found guilty of a charge of assisting her husband to flee the country following the shooting and will be sentenced in November after reports have been prepared.

John 'Boy' Ward's brother, Francis Ward, 36, and his sister Winifred, 47, also pleaded not guilty to assisting his escape from the UK.

Francis Ward, from Kensington was convicted of assisting an offender and his sister – of  Hounslow – was convicted of an identical charge.

They, too, will be sentenced with Joeleen in November.

Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward, pictured with his mother, Lily, was sent to jail for 13 months in July for trying to avenge his son's death

In July this year, Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward, was jailed for 13 months after he flipped his BMW sports car while drunkenly driving around in a revenge mission to find his son's killers.

James Ward flipped the car on to its roof after ploughing into another vehicle when he got behind the wheel while drunk, uninsured and disqualified from driving. 

He crashed into another vehicle, causing serious injuries to a woman and child who were inside the car, who had to be airlifted to hospital.
