No surprises: Sir Michael Wilshaw does not want snap Ofsted visits - despite failures being revealed

Ofsted's chief inspector has stood by his decision to rule out snap school inspections - despite downgrading two-thirds of those which had surprise visits since September.

Twenty-three of the 35 schools lost at least one grade - and 11 were rapped for failing to teach pupils about other cultures in modern, multicultural Britain.

But Sir Michael Wilshaw told Education Secretary Nicky Morgan there were still 'logistical drawbacks' to the shock visits and they should not become routine.

'This exercise has confirmed that we have the regional intelligence and the appropriate powers to conduct inspections without notice where serious concerns have been identified,' he wrote.

'Nevertheless, inspectors reported that there were logistical drawbacks to inspecting without notice because of difficulties in effectively engaging with school leaders, governors and parents.

'This view is consistent with Ofsted's previous consultations on the use of no-notice inspection and supports my decision that we should not move to routine no-notice inspections for all schools.'

Sir Michael's vow, first made last month, appeared to be a dramatic U-turn from Ofsted's previous stance.

The inspection body had pledged a clampdown which could include visits prompted by parents' complaints as recently as this year.

And it comes despite the most recent surprise inspections revealing failings at more than 20 schools across England.

The 35 schools were visited with no warning in September and October because of 'serious concerns' about standards, behaviour, discipline, leadership or the breadth of the curriculum.

In  11  the inspectors found pupils were 'not being well prepared for life in modern Britain' - meaning they were not being taught enough about other religions or cultures.

Some of the schools were not doing enough to promote 'pupils’ awareness and tolerance of communities different to their own', the inspectors added. 

Michael Gove first pushed for schools to promote 'British values' in 2012 and the government launched new, stronger regulations in the summer to crack down on those not seen as doing enough.

The list of 11 includes Catholic, Church of England and non-denominational schools, and one Jewish high school.

One community primary school in the market town of Chippenham, Wiltshire, was criticised despite inspectors admitting the 'vast majority of pupils are from a White British background'.

They told teachers at Stanton St Quintin Primary they did 'not go far enough in making pupils aware of the rich diversity of life in modern Britain.'

Durham Community Business College was told it was inadequate and students 'do not have a good grasp of other religions and faiths and are not clear enough about some of the features of modern Britain, such as democracy.'

And at the Jewish Beis Yaakov High School in Salford, Greater Manchester, inspectors wrote: 'There are major gaps in students’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development.

'Students are not provided with sufficient opportunities to learn about or understand people of other faiths or cultures. The school does not promote adequately students’ awareness and tolerance of communities which are different to their own.

'As a result, the school does not prepare students adequately for life in modern Britain. This means that the school is failing to give its students an acceptable standard of education.'

Ofsted said the Damson Wood Infant School in Solihull, West Midlands, failed to promote 'positive attitudes to school or enable pupils to have respect for other people’s cultures'.

And at the Charles Dickens School in Broadstairs, Kent - also rated inadequate - there was not enough 'planned, high quality teaching about how differences in, for example, sexual orientation or ethnic heritages, are valued and respected, and so students are not prepared well for life in modern-day Britain.'

Sir Michael insisted the findings were not 'political correctness'.

'It's nonsense, for example, to suggest we would mark down a school for being "too white"', he said.

'We simply want to ensure children are receiving a good education and are being prepared for life in modern Britain.

'This is not about political correctness. It's being realistic about the diverse society we now live in.

'Above all, it's about being fair to every school we inspect - whether it's a faith school, a secular school, or whether it's located in an inner-city or rural location.

'Of course, inspectors should take proper account of the school's context but they should also apply the same high expectations of every school when it comes to preparing our young people for the world beyond the school gates.'

The reports have emerged days after Ofsted threatened to close six privately-run Muslim schools it said were vulnerable to radicalisation. 

Sir Michael added: 'It would be wrong for inspectors to only criticise certain types of schools and not others if we find they aren't doing enough to promote respect and tolerance of others and an understanding of the core values that bind us together as a nation.'

A Department for Education spokesman added: 'Our plan for education is clear that all young people should learn the knowledge, skills and values they need to prepare them for life in modern Britain.

'We want every school to promote the basic British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance for those of different faiths and beliefs.

'This ensures young people understand the importance of respect and leave school ready to play their full part in British society.

'While the vast majority of schools successfully promote these values, we will not hesitate to step in when pupils are being let down.

'The targeted use of unannounced inspections remains an important part of Ofsted's overall approach to looking at schools where there might be particular concerns.' 

Leadership was deemed inadequate in another 11 schools, with the chief inspector citing 'inappropriate interference in the school’s day-to-day management', 'a breakdown in relationships' between schools and governors and 'insufficient awareness of the school’s performance'.

Some also had a 'lack of financial transparency', which has been reported to the authorities.
