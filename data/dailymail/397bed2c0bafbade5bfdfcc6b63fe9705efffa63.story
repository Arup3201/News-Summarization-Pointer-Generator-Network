Nancy Reagan is 'heartbroken' over the death of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a close friend and kindred political spirit of her late husband, but is too frail to attend her funeral.

The former first lady, 91, has instead asked the chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation to represent her at the London service Wednesday, her spokeswoman said.

'Mrs Reagan is heartbroken over Baroness Thatcher's death and would really like to be there in person to pay her respects,' the spokeswoman said.

Friends: Nancy Reagan, the wife of US president Ronald Reagan, is said to be devastated about Margaret Thatcher's death, but will also not be attending the funeral

'Unfortunately, she is no longer able to make that kind of a trip, so will not be attending the funeral.

'She has asked Fred Ryan, the chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and long-time personal friend, to represent her.'

Lady Thatcher who was Britain's first 
female prime minister was in office for 11 years, from 1979 to 1990. She
 died Monday after suffering a stroke at age 87.

All surviving presidents have been invited to the funeral as has former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, officials said.

Around 2,000 invitations are being sent out.

The Queen and Prince Philip broke with tradition by agreeing to attend the funeral.

The
 only other time a reigning monarch had attended the final farewell of a
 Prime Minister was in 1965, when the Queen joined the congregation for 
the funeral of Winston Churchill.

The extraordinary gesture delighted 
Lady Thatcher’s friends and allies disappointed that she would not be 
honoured with a full state funeral. No other members of the Royal Family will be present.

It has emerged former Soviet leader 
Mikhail Gorbachev will not attend Baroness Thatcher's funeral due to ill
 health as Downing Street started sending invites round the world today.

The
 82-year-old, who paid tribute to  as a 'heavyweight politician and a 
striking person' following her death on Monday, was expected to be one 
of many global figures to attend next week.

His spokesman, Vladimir Polyakov, said he would not be attending due to health problems.

The guest list had been drawn up by Lady Thatcher's family and 
representatives with the assistance of the Government and the 
Conservative Party, Downing Street officials said.

More
 than 2,000 invitations are expected to be printed today and sent out 
tomorrow. Altogether 2,300 people are set to pack St Paul's.

A
 representative of former South African president Nelson Mandela - whose
 ANC Lady Thatcher once described as a terrorist group - has been 
invited.

The dress code
 for the event gives guests the option of 'Full Day Ceremonial without 
swords', 'Morning Dress (Black Waistcoat and Black Tie) / dark suit', or
 'Day dress with Hat'.

It also specifies that 'medals and decorations' may be worn.

The
 invitations will be color coded depending on the importance of the 
guest. VIP versions are white with red or green stripes and recipients 
will be seated under the dome of the cathedral.

Other colors designate different areas of seating.

But Argentine President Cristina 
Fernández de Kirchner will not be invited to Baroness Thatcher’s 
funeral, MailOnline has learned.

Officials
 drawing up the guest list have moved to block an invitation being sent 
to President Kirchner who in recent months has sought to reignite the 
struggle for control of the Falkland Islands.

President Obama and wife, Michelle, are 
expected to be invited along with the first President George Bush, who 
was in the White House while Lady Thatcher was in Downing Street, and 
his wife, Barbara, but it has not yet been made clear who will make the 
trip.

David Cameron will be joined by Sir John Major and senior politicians from the Thatcher years, but there may be a couple of notable exceptions.

Her political opponent Lord Kinnock will not attend the funeral.

The former Labour leader has instead chosen to attend a memorial service for a former councillor in Wales next Wednesday.

'He will not be attending because a councillor in his old constituency died a few days before Lady Thatcher. He promised he would go to the funeral,' his spokesman said.

FW de Klerk, the last president of apartheid South Africa, will be attending the funeral as a guest of the Thatcher family, a spokesman for the FW de Klerk Foundation confirmed yesterday.

Mr de Klerk, who ordered the release of Nelson Mandela from jail and agreed to negotiations that ended apartheid, earlier paid tribute to Lady Thatcher 'not only as one of Britain's greatest prime ministers but also as a leader whose policies and approach had a significant impact on politics throughout the world'.

Germany’s premier Angela Merkel will decide within the next 48 hours whether to attend but if not, her place will be taken instead by President Joachim Gauck.

Ten members of staff from the Ritz hotel, where Lady Thatcher had been staying since Christmas until her death there on Monday, have also been invited to her funeral as thanks for the care she received.

Comedian Jim Davidson is likely to attend as she was a 'great fan', according to former MP Gyles Brandreth,  who said she like his attempts to entertain the troops and his charity work.

Scotland Yard said today that it is working with City of London Police (CoLP) and British Transport Police (BTP) to finalise planning and preparations for the policing operation for the funeral.

Police officers will be stationed along the funeral cortege's route, and road closures will be in place, as well as a range of security measures.

A mobile team of officers, called reserves, will also be ready to respond to events anywhere in London.

Commander Christine Jones, from the Met Police, said: 'Our planning is being carried out using tried and tested systems so we are in a position to deliver the most effective operation we can.

'Every operation that we deliver is based upon a thorough assessment of the potential risks, and then we plan the most effective ways to mitigate against them.

'We wish to deliver our operation in a way that protects and secures, but does not intrude upon those people who wish to pay their respects.'

She said they would monitor a range of information for the most 'up-to-date intelligence picture', right up until Wednesday, adding: 'There has been much speculation about what levels of protest may take place.

'I would ask anyone who wishes to demonstrate then, or in the coming days, to come and talk to us.

'The right to protest is one that must be upheld; however, we will work to do that whilst balancing the rights of those who wish to pay their respects and those who wish to travel about London as usual.'
