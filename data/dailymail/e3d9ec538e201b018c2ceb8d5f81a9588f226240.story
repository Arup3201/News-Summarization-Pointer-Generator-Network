Scotland claimed another gold in the women's +78kgs heavyweights, where Sarah Adlington edged out England's Jodie Myers, the British Judo Centre of Excellence fighter, on a Yuko.

The bronze medals went to Annabelle Laprovidence of Maurituas and India's Rajwinder Kaur.

Adlington, who has just returned from an injury lay-off, said: 'The crowd were amazing, to come away with the win is fantastic.

'It is the first time I have fought since February, so to come back here and win gold hopefully stands in good stead for the Olympic qualifiers coming up later this year, which I can go into with confidence.'

Teenage Myers is determined to learn from her experiences.

She said: 'I am happy that I have medalled, that is an achievement in itself, but I can here to win. At the end of the day, I am 19, and have so many years ahead of me, and this is just one experience I can take forwards.'

Tight contest: Adlington's yuko was enough for her to come out on top at the SECC on Saturday evening
