Apologetic: Cleveland Smith reportedly apologized for an attempted armed robbery by calling his victim as he was on his way to jail

A Florida man behind bars for an armed home invasion called his victim to apologize just before he was locked up.

Cleveland Smith and two other men broke into a Boynton Beach home May 15 and seriously injured homeowner Chris Bates when the Smith pistol-whipped Bates with his own gun, police said.

Bates claimed to WPBF the attack forced him to get 11 staples in his head when he visited a local hospital, and he refused to accept Smith’s apology.

'He was like … oh just listen listen, listen, listen, bro I didn't mean to do that, the guys were going to kill me, they had a gun to my back,' Bates told the station.

The encounter started when the trio broke into Bates’ home after knocking on his door, police told WPTV.

One of the robbers then pulled a gun on bates and demanded entry to his home, cops said.

Bates attempted to fight the men off, but Smith grabbed Bates’ gun and smashed him in the side of the head with it, authorities said.

The victim told WPBF he did not accept the apology or believe Smith had any remorse for his actions.

Bates knows Smith personally, and said the attacker knew he shared the home with his fiancée and two young children.

‘I don't take the apology because my fiancé could've lost his life,' Rutta Aliensy told WPBF.

Bates later identified Smith from a photo lineup. The other attackers have yet to be apprehended.
