A 61-year-old soldier says he has been kicked out of the army  because he is 'too old' - even though he can still run a mile-and-a-half in just ten minutes.

Fitness fanatic Kevin Fulthorpe spent 25 years in the army reserve, where he gave fitness training to his younger comrades.

The sergeant, who is an amateur boxer and has won cross country honours for the army, also claims that he is fitter than most men half his age.

Kevin Fulthorpe, 61 (left and right), from Cardiff, says he has been kicked out of the army because he is 'too old' - even though he can still run a mile-and-a-half in just ten minutes 

The sergeant (pictured) can also do 44 press-ups in two minutes and 50 sit-ups in the same amount of time

But the military has now forced him to retire - even though he can still pass a military fitness test with flying colours - due to what he claims is age discrimination. 

The sportsman, from Cardiff, can still do 44 press-ups in two minutes and 50 sit-ups in the same amount of time - the requirements needed to qualify as a new reservist recruit for the Parachute Regiment. 

He said: 'How dare the Army tell me I'm too old to do my job - it's a kick in teeth.

'I have a lifetime working in fitness, I feel I have so much to give in an era where fitness and obesity is a growing problem.

'The army does not exempt people on gender, ethnicity or religion but it discriminates against age.' 

The usual age for the army to retire non-commissioned officers is 55, but Mr Fulthorpe has been given year-on-year extensions owing to his fitness. 

He hoped to continue working with the army reserve as a fitness instructor after turning 61, but was told it was time for his retirement. 

Mr Fulthorpe has also taken part in several marathons, half-marathons and triathlons.

He has been an amateur boxer and is still a chief inspector for a UK-wide boxing safety board.

Age Cymru's chief executive Ian Thomas said: 'Kevin's story clearly demonstrates the demoralising effect that age-based policies can have on us.

'We have an ageing population and age discrimination by most employers is now illegal.

'However older people are the ones who are most likely to suffer long-term unemployment and many still face major barriers in employment and new work opportunities.

'It is time to turn our backs on old fashioned ideas about age and ageing.'

The army has recently extended age limits for reservists for specialist roles such as intelligence experts and medics, as it tries to grow the reserve to 30,000. 

A spokesperson said: 'While we cannot comment on specific cases, the normal retirement age for Regulars and Reservists is 55, and on occasion units can extend an individuals service yearly up until the age of 60.

'Decisions to extend service beyond the age of 60 are only taken in exceptional circumstances and on a case by case basis.'
