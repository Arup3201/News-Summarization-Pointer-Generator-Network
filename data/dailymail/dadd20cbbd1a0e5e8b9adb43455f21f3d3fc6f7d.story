A mother-of-three is lucky to be alive after a rare stomach ulcer caused her to vomit up seven pints of blood.

Samantha Foxcroft, of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, thought she had contracted a common stomach bug before she started being violently sick, causing her to lose a huge amount of blood.

In fact, the 33-year-old had a stomach ulcer which 
had eaten through the wall of her stomach and pierced an artery, 
leading to extreme bleeding.

At first she thought she had picked up a bug from her children who had been unwell.

But her condition dramatically deteriorated when she rushed to the toilets at work to be sick - and promptly collapsed.

She said: 'A co-worker came and discovered blood all over the walls and floor.

'When I woke up I looked down into the toilet bowl and the liquid was bright red.

'It was extremely frightening. All I wanted to do was to be sick again.'

The housing association officer was taken to A&E at the Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby where medical staff struggled to understand what was happening to her.

She said: 'Nurses held bowl after bowl under my mouth. The blood wouldn’t stop coming.

'It looked as if there had been a bloody massacre around my bed - it was complete chaos.

'I fell in and out of consciousness, although I instinctively knew I was dying.

'My first thought was that I had not had the chance to say goodbye to my three children.

'The medics were hand-pumping units of blood into me as fast as I was vomiting the blood out.

'At first no-one knew what the matter was. By the time I was taken for exploratory surgery I’d lost more than four litres of blood.'

It was later revealed that she had a stomach ulcer which had penetrated the wall of her stomach.

It is rare for someone her age to experience such a condition.

She said: 'The doctor told me that he had never seen someone lose so much blood and survive.

'He said I was lucky not to have died.

'If I had started being sick half an hour later, I would have been in the car.

'I would have no option other than to pull over to the side of the road and slump. If I had been on my own, I wouldn’t be here today.'

Following the episode in October 2012, Ms Foxcroft made a slow recovery on the intensive care ward.

For six weeks she was on a drip receiving medication to help rebuild and reinforce her stomach lining.

It took her a year to recover fully.

Doctors are still unsure whether the ulcer was caused by a chemical reaction - possibly from a course of painkillers she had taken for neck ache that summer - or stress.

Ms Foxcroft said: 'Stress can do incredible things to the body.

'I was dealing with a lot of different challenges at the time. I was going through a difficult break up and working three jobs, so things were getting on top of me.

'I’m still very worried about being left anywhere on my own in case it happens again, although I’m very lucky to have a good support network of friends.

'My workplace gave my colleagues the day off work so they could donate blood while I was in hospital.'

Ms Foxcroft, who is mother to Georgia, nine, Corban, five and James, three, has now become a vocal advocate of the blood donation services which saved her life.

The 33-year-old lost seven pints of blood during her illness, one pint shy of the average amount of blood circulating in a person's body.

She said: 'I exhausted the hospital’s blood supply by myself. If people hadn’t made blood donations, I wouldn’t have made it.

'My children are all very keen to help me raise awareness of blood donation too. As a family we’ve come to learn just how important it is.

'I had so many blood transfusions that I have the blood of 12 different people in my veins. I was so happy when everyone at work donated as a gesture of support.

'I can’t thank enough the doctors who saved my life.'
