According to the Star Tribune, Lawrence's dog, a fluffy white bichon frise named Toby, jumped out of the vehicle where Lawrence and his wife Donna were waiting for help.

Anderson got out of the vehicle to chase the dog and was fatally struck by another motorist.

Shelton Short, of Osceola, was driving an SUV and struck Anderson as he tried to capture the dog. The 34-year-old 'did not see the pedestrian and was unable to avoid [the] collision,' according to the patrol report.

Short was uninjured in the collision that threw Anderson against a cable barrier on the median strip.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Star Tribune reports that the Andersons took their RV south for a few months every winter on vacation.

The couple were retired and Anderson was often spotted by neighbors walking Toby two or three times a day.

After the accident, Toby was recovered and taken to a nearby animal shelter, Carol Clark of the Kiua Koda Humane Society in Indianola told the Star Tribune.

Family of Anderson picked up the dog, which was unhurt, on Thursday.
