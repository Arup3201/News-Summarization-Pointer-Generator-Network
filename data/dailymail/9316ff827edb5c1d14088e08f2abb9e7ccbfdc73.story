When The Killing first burst onto British TV screens in 2011, few expected it to be a hit. But despite low expectations, a hit it proved and so a cult classic was born.

Now one of the stars of season two, Carsten Bjørnlund, 41, is back with another Danish drama and it promises to be just as tense (and heavy on the stylish knitwear) as its predecessors.

Starring Bjørnlund and Trine Dyrholm - an actress dubbed Denmark's answer to Helen Mirren - as two of four warring siblings, The Legacy takes an uncomfortably close look at the dynamics of a defiantly dysfunctional family.

While it might sound like a relatively simple concept, in true Scandinavian style, the plot has more twists and turns than a labyrinth plus enough red herrings to feed the population of Denmark for a year.

'It's a story about secrets, lies, tension and love,' explains Bjørnlund. 'Everyone can relate to being a brother or a sister or a daughter and all of those perspectives are covered in the show. 

It makes it very easy to connect with the characters along the way.'

Not that the majority of us would want to connect with any of the by turns angry, manipulative and dark characters in real life.

Bjørnlund's is Frederik Grønnegaard, the estranged son of matriarch Veronika and a man who manages to combine a semi-detached character with not always well hidden anger.

Other family members include Signe, the daughter given up for adoption who becomes the sole beneficiary of Veronika's will - and thus the target of everyone else's anger - and Frederik's sister Gro - played by Denmark's answer to Helen Mirren, Dyrholm.

'I really love this character because she's really complex and she's not likeable all the time,' explains the 42-year-old of her art-loving character.

'I like that you have space and room to get all the nuances. I like that none of the characters deserve sympathy but in other ways, they all do.'

Dyrholm is no stranger to a complex family saga, having earned plaudits for her deft handling of the role of Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in the fiendishly complex royal romance, A Royal Affair, in 2012.

More recently, she has starred in a series of tense thrillers, among them The Legacy, but also creepy German indie flick, Who Am I – No System Is Safe.

All this has led to her being compared to the UK's own Helen Mirren; a comparison which she says - 20 year age gap between her and Mirren notwithstanding - is something she delights in.

'Well, I don't mind that title,' she chuckles. 'I'm a big fan of hers so its an honour to be compared to her. 

Tense: Her latest role is as art-loving Gro Grønnegaard who is devastated by the death of her mother

Tense: Gro is infuriated to discover that her mother has left the family home to a hitherto unknown sibling

'I'm just interested in good work and I started out when I was pretty young and I've been privileged to work on some brilliant films and I try to challenge and develop myself. I see Helen Mirren as someone to work towards.'

That she has had so much good work is testament, in part, to the Danish love of a strong female lead along the lines of Lund and Nyborg - something that Dyrholm is grateful for. 

'We have long had a tradition for complex and interesting female parts,' she smiles. 'All the characters in Danish dramas tend to be quite complex. 

'I'm aware, though, that we're standing on the shoulders of all the other series that have been popular in Denmark and abroad.

'If it hadn't been for Sarah Lund and Brigitte Nyborg, we wouldn't be able to move on to do all the things that we do.'

And no one knows that better than Bjørnlund, whose fledgling career got a shot in the arm when he landed the part of Christian Søgaard, a soldier intent on appropriating his junior colleague's wife, in the second series of The Killing.

Popular: The Killing became a huge hit in the UK and elsewhere when it was released in 2011

Hit: According to makers DR, The Legacy was even more popular in Denmark than The Killing and Borgen

Fascinating: Bjørnlund says Britons find Danish life exotic - hence the success of Danish TV series

'I wasn't in London when The Killing came out, so it was only when we made the Legacy that I realised how much people loved it,' he says, pleased.

'I think it's good that we, as a small country, can produce dramas that so many people around the world love. I'm proud of that.

'I think Denmark is having a golden age for drama,' he adds. 'I don't want to jinx anything but it would be a shame not to admit that - as long as it lasts anyway!'

But while it was The Killing that made his name, Bjørnlund wants The Legacy to do even better - and hopes what he describes as a British 'fascination' with all things Danish will propel it forward.

'I think Denmark seems exotic to people from the UK,' he explains. 'Even though our lives seem similar, there are slight differences that make it exotic for you.'

There are more than slight differences between British (and most Danish) families and the one portrayed in The Legacy though. 

Bjørnlund doesn't think so and says there are even similarities between the dysfunctional Grønnegaards and his own family.

'It differs in many ways but there are problems,' he admits. 'Of course there are!'

From the Christiansborg Palace (Borgen) to Politigården (Police Headquarters, The Killing), the success of Danish drama has provided a shot in the arm for the Danish tourist industry.

'Danish films and TV series certainly help to brand Denmark internationally and attract visitors to Denmark,' explains Visit Denmark's Kathrine Lind Gustavussen.

'Britain is now the biggest non-Scandinavian market for visitors to Copenhagen and across the whole of Denmark, tourists from the UK booked 40.3 per cent more overnight stays in 2013 than in 2009. 

'According to VisitDenmark's Brand Survey 2014, 20 per cent of Britons now associate Denmark with movies and TV series.'

Popular though locations made famous by Borgen and The Killing are, The Legacy has more than a few lovely stop-offs of its own, not least the Thorvaldsens Museum (thorvaldsensmuseum.dk) where Gro spills a glass of champagne during a particularly frustrating moment.

Other top spots associated with the new show include the pretty Svendborg Harbour, the glamorous Den Frie art gallery (denfrie.dk) where Gro works and her Islands Brugge apartment which is even available to rent via Stay Copenhagen.

'The so-called Nordic Noir wave has painted a somewhat gloomy picture of the Danes,' adds Gustavussen, who is keen to prove that the Danes aren't quite as glum as The Legacy would have you believe.

'Visitors who want to immerse themselves in Denmark's gritty ambience might be disappointed but hopefully they will leave with a more romantic, happy and colourful impression of the country.'

Not if Dyrholm and Bjørnlund get their way.
