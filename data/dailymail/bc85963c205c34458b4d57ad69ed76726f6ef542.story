Families face child penalties of up to £244 on summer holidays, the Mail can reveal today.

Travel firms have been charging two parents and two youngsters more than they would four adults booking exactly the same package.

The levy applied to popular Thomas Cook and Thomson hotels and apartments in Spain, Greece and Turkey. Both firms admitted the pricing discrepancy existed.

Effectively an under-occupancy charge, the policy is similar to the supplements single travellers fall foul of.

The Daily Mail obtained quotes for a family with two children aged six and ten for a week’s holiday on August 3 and compared them with the same stay for four adults.

Thomas Cook’s website charged £2,060 for the family at apartments in Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands – £244 more than for a group of four adults.

At a hotel on neighbouring Gran Canaria, the price was £1,932 – a premium of £196 over the adult group.

Thomson quoted £2,025 for the family to stay at apartments on Menorca – £173 more than the same trip for four adults. A stay at a holiday village in Bodrum, Turkey, cost £1,611 – a £135 premium.

A spokesman for the consumer group Which? condemned the policy, saying: ‘It’s completely unfair that holidays should cost more for parents because of under-occupancy charges for children.’

Even though travel companies generally charge for each child – in terms of flights and accommodation – they are often not treated as adults in terms of occupancy targets.

As a result, computer systems can trigger a supplement.

Hotels use the policy to make up for lower restaurant and bar sales from children.

Thomas Cook suggested parents may find it cheaper to describe their youngsters as adults when booking.

Thomson apologised for what it claims was a mistake rather than a deliberate policy.

‘We are aware of an issue with the pricing of a very small number of our villa and apartment holidays,’ a spokesman said.

‘On occasion, a villa or apartment will be more expensive if booked including adults and children compared to a purely adult booking. We are working to rectify this issue. 

‘Our retail staff will always look for the lowest price available for customers booking in store, and we have rebriefed them to ensure they continue to do this.

‘We recommend that any customer planning to book online before the issue is resolved should check the total cost of their booking against that of all adults and book as adults if necessary.’ 

After the Daily Mail highlighted the anomaly, Thomson set up a phone line to allow families to claim refunds. Thomas Cook said the policy only ‘very rarely’ led to a family being charged more.

A spokesman said: ‘Our agents will always find the best price for our holidays, including on the rare occasions when a minimum adult occupancy level is not met. 

‘In such cases, it is common practice for any children travelling to be charged the adult price. Meeting the adult minimum occupancy can be cheaper.’

Thomson customers who have questions about the price they have paid and whether they can claim a refund should contact the company on 0800 0093847.
