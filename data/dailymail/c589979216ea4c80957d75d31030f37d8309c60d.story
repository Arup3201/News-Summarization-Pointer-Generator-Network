Despite declaring independence from Britain 200 years ago, America celebrated the birth of a future king today, with stores and pubs around the country adorning their walls with Union Jack bunting, 'It's a Boy' banners and preparing British-themed parties and cakes in the likeness of the new mother.

After Kate Middleton was admitted to St. Mary's hospital early this morning, baby fever hit London and the rest of the United Kingdom. But it didn't take long for the excitement to travel across the Atlantic - and once it was revealed the royal baby was a boy, it only escalated.

Meanwhile, U.S. broadcasters were representing the country in force outside the hospital in London as royal baby hysteria gripped the television networks. America's top broadcasters were sent to the U.K. to report live from Paddington on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's new baby boy.

In New York, the block of Manhattan's Greenwich Village know as 'Little Britain' joined in on the fun with British flags, cupcakes, special menus and other celebrations for customers to partake in.

Celebrations in the states: Union Jack bunting was hung for the Royal Baby in Greenwich Village, New York

Thrilled: Tea & Sympathy manager Haley Simmons said July 22, 2013, she was thrilled to hear about the royal baby's birth

English tea house Tea & Sympathy had 'It's a Girl' and 'It's a Boy' banners ready to go, and rushed to hang the blue ones out the front of the Greenwich Avenue store once it was announced the healthy 8lb 6oz baby was a boy.

The tea house manager Haley Simmons told DNAInfo.com the restaurant baked pink cupcakes earlier on Monday in the hope the infant would be a girl.

'It's not only a royal baby, (the baby) is third in line for the throne, which is exciting,' she said.

The tea house will also throw a party for the newest royal's christening, she explained.

Meanwhile, chef Daniel Eardley from nearby Cole's Greenwich Village was planning a special British entree, to welcome the little boy to the world as workers again hung Union Jacks outside.

'When you're British, a royal birth is something to be so proud of,' Bradley told DNA. 'It's a new generation for the British royal family.'

Elsewhere in the states, royalists were also celebrating the birth of Kate and William's son.

'This
is very exciting,' Liverpool native Julie Primus, who owns Julie's 
British Shoppe in Melbourne, Florida, told the Orlando Sentinel.

She said earlier this morning: 'As soon as we know if it's a boy or girl we will decorate the shop and probably hand out balloons to customers.'

She said she plans to throw a christening tea party at the shop to coincide with the baby's baptism in England.

'We did something similar for the Queen's jubilee and it was great fun.'

In Lake County, Marsha Goodale's Windsor Rose Tea Room in Mount Dora is planning a baby shower to help out a local charity.

'We're envisioning champagne and cake and we'll play lots of shower games,' Goodale, whose husband hails from Essex, England, told the Sentinel.

'If guests bring a baby gift it will be given to a local charity. The details are still be worked out because right now we're simply excited about the pending birth.'

For others, celebrations have been underway for sometime, with some businesses holding events in the weeks running up to the birth.

Zachary Pope from Roundz in Maryland has also been using the happy event to help those less fortunate, he told the UK's Channel Four TV station.

'I'm 40 and I remember when Prince William was born... the Americans have a real romance with the royals,' he said.

'We were kicking around some ideas about something to do locally for it so we decided to give a royal baby shower benefit.

'We started collecting baby items that would be donated to a local charity that supports mothers on a low income.'

Jayne Yazdi, owner of the Haile Village Bistro in Florida, hosted a very English tea party to 'shower' the royal mum-to-be.

'Americans think it is great! They are just interested in everything to do with the royal family,' she explained.

'We did a similar thing for the royal wedding. We had a television up and people came in at 5 a.m. to watch it. The baby shower was packed with people dressed up in their gloves and dresses.'

Meanwhile, Las Vegas betting companies had been taking bets on everything from the gender to the possible name, weight and hair color of Kate and William's first born.

Monarchists and reporters waited around the clock for the Duchess of Cambridge to give birth - and on Monday, it was announced she gave birth to a son weighing 8lbs and 6oz at 4.24pm GMT. She had arrived at the hospital just before 6am and entered via a back door, eluding journalists.

As excitement grew among royal fans gathering outside the hospital before the birth, television camera crews from across the U.S. - including all of the major networks - were also swarming outside the private Lindo Wing at St. Mary's in Paddington.

'I've been here all week and this is a scene I've never seen before,' Today show host Natalie Morales said outside the hospital on Monday morning as she said that a birth announcement is hopefully imminent. 'There's a lot of excitement. It's hard to move around... Everyone is just watching that door.'

The relief comes after Morales was pictured passing the time by eating fish and chips, drinking ale, reading British literature and knitting a gift for the baby as she waited for news of his or her birth last week.

Coverage of the birth blanketed the main networks on Monday morning, with every one sending out their top hosts and correspondents to provide viewers with the latest news of the royal baby. As the birth of the boy was revealed on Monday afternoon, all the networks cut to the announcement.

'I feel the excitement her even in the United States,' CNN's Brooke Baldwin said on Monday afternoon.

Outside the hospital, Morales was joined on NBC by medical editor Dr Nancy Snyderman, who described the procedure for a woman in labor.

ABC correspondent Amy Robach added on Good Morning America on Monday: 'After weeks of waiting here outside the hospital, it is fair to say that the Lindo wing is no longer in limbo... For so long, I have these tired long faces, there are nothing but smiles as far as the eye can see. Despite this 90 degree heat, everyone is full of excitement for this baby.'

As well as Morales, Nightly News correspondent Kate Snow has also been sent by NBC to London to cover the birth. The network also has Keir Simmons, Michelle Kosinski and Martin Fletcher in London.

ABC News sent Good Morning America weekend anchor Bianna Golodryga and correspondent Lama Hasan to London, with Amy Robach to follow. The network is also including Dr. Jennifer Ashton, its senior medical correspondent, in special reports.

Fox News anchor Martha McCallum is anchoring its coverage, while CNN's Kate Bolduan is overseeing New Day's interviews with relatives and friends close to the royals.

On Monday, there was a large police presence around the hospital as royal fans gathered alongside the media outside the hospital, and well-wishers from around the globe began swarming outside Buckingham Palace.
