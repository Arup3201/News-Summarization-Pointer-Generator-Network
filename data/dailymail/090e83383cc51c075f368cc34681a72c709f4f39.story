The mother whose three young daughters and parents perished in a Christmas Day blaze at her Connecticut mansion last year has revealed 'visits' from her children have helped her to heal.

Madonna Badger, who survived the fire along with her then-boyfriend, contractor Michael Borcina, said that she is doing 'really well' thanks to visions of her three girls, Lily, Sarah and Grace.

'I've seen my children in my dreams,' she told Today host Matt Lauer. 'When I pray, I see my children.

Moving on: Speaking to Matt Lauer, she said visions of her children have helped her with her grief

'Lily came to me very early on and said to me, 'Don't worry mommy, I'm right there in your heart, and I love you".

'Once when I was having level 10 - the 
worst sort of cries, when it feels like blood is coming out of my eyes - Sarah 
came to me in the mirror and said, "There's nothing to be afraid of".'

While
Mrs Badger admitted that she first thought she 'was a little nuts' for the 
visions, she said she realised it was important to for her heeling, and 
professional help and readings have allowed her to accept it.

'I'm doing really well, I'm shocked that I'm doing OK, but I'm doing really well,' she said, smiling.

Loss: The blaze claimed the lives of (left to right) seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah and Lily, nine

Missed: Her parents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson, were also killed on Christmas Day last year

In
her last interview with the Today show, in June, Mrs Badger had struggled to 
contain her emotions as she recounted her Christmas Day preparations 
with her children, her mother and Borcina.

When the couple went to bed, they put 
fireplace ashes in a box inside a mud room.

Despite Borcina running 
his hands through the ashes to check for heat, the $1.7 million home ignited, killing
the children and their grandparents, Pauline and Lomer Johnson, in the early hours of Christmas Day.

Following their deaths, Badger said she went to three mental institutions and considered suicide, but the support of her friends helped her get through.

She moved in with one of her friends in Little Rock, Arkansas - where she still lives - for four months when 'half my hair had fallen out'.

Inferno: The fire was started by still-smouldering fireplace embers left inside the Connecticut mansion

'I was a disaster,' she said. 'They made me promise I wouldn't kill myself. They brought me back to life.'

And as Christmas - and the 
anniversary of that tragic day - looms, she has made plans to go to 
Thailand, which is a 'Santa Claus-free zone'.

'I'm going to work in an orphanage with young girls who've lost their families and bring toys from my garage that belonged to my children,' she said.

'I'm going to pray and meditate and be with my kids and love them and do the very best I can.'

She added that she no longer contemplates suicide because she doesn't 'know what would happen if I did that and I don't want to risk not being with my children'.

Grief: Madonna Badger cries left with her ex-husband Matthew at the funeral of their three daughters, while she is pictured, right, with her then-boyfriend Michael Borcina, who also survived the blaze

Missed: Mrs Badger said the girls come to her and comfort her, which helps her know they are always with her

Her interview comes just days after her 
ex-husband and the father of the girls, Matthew Badger, said he felt as 
if he wanted to kill her and her boyfriend following the tragedy.

'I thought that was perfectly normal,' she told Lauer. 'I
certainly felt the same way. I don't judge Matthew's grief.
In fact, I am incredibly proud of him for what he's done with the 
LilySarahGrace fund.'

The fund, named after nine-year-old Lily and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah, raises money for art programs for schools, as the girls, who were all dyslexic, loved art.

Mr Badger, 47, has yet to return to his job as a commercial director and two months ago went on a pilgrimage to India with his girlfriend where he met the Dalai Lama and cried, he told New York magazine. Afterwards, he scattered some of the girls' ashes on a hill.
