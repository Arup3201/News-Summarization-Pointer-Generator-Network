Weeping and wailing Nick Gordon, the troubled fiancé of Bobbi Kristina Brown, has admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed: 'I'm so sorry for everything.'

Gordon, 25, was speaking to Dr Phil McGraw in a dramatic intervention due to air on Wednesday, Daily Mail Online can reveal.

Asked if he still intended to kill himself he said: 'If anything happens to Krissi I will.'

Amid scenes of high emotion, an often incoherent Gordon admitted drinking heavily and taking Xanax, for which he has a prescription, in an attempt to deal with life since Bobbi Kristina was found, face down and unresponsive in her bathtub on January 31.

Breakdown: With his mother, Michelle, by his side Nick Gordon struggles to stay coherent as he is questioned by Dr Phil. Girlfriend Bobbi Kristina is in a medically induced coma

Troubling preview: A trailer for the interview of Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend Nick Gordon by Dr Phil McGraw was released Sunday night. Swinging from crying  to flying into a rage, the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by Dr Phil

Comfort: Nick's supportive mother Michelle was by Nick's side during the entire intervention

Blame game: Michelle said her son 'cannot take too much more of not being able to see Kriss. He blames himself. He's torn up and carrying guilt. He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop. I've tried to help him but he can't let go of the guilt.'

Hugs: Before he left for rehab, Nick and his mother embraced. She said her son was at 'the breaking point'.

He said: 'My pain is horrible. My heart hurts. I have panic attacks.'

In recent weeks Gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of Xanax, alcohol and prescription sleeping pills.

Gordon had agreed to meet with Dr Phil believing that he was there to be interviewed. According to Dr Phil: 'He felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster.'

Instead, on learning of Gordon's rapidly deteriorating mental, emotional and physical state, the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab.

Dr Phil stated: 'I don't think he has any chance of turning this round. Left to his own devices he will be dead within the week.'

Gordon's mother, Michelle, was by her son's side as he alternated between compliant and aggressive – at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed.

She described her son as 'at breaking point.'

She said: 'He cannot take too much more of not being able to see Kriss. He blames himself. He's torn up and carrying guilt.

'He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop. I've tried to help him but he can't let go of the guilt.'

Leaning towards Gordon's mother, Dr Phil said: 'You and I have one mission with one possible outcome and that's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression, his guilt…and to get clean and sober.'

He added: 'His life absolutely hangs in the balance.'

Questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of January 31st that led to Bobbi Kristina, 22, ending up face down in her tub.

Just two days ago Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Leolah Brown, made a series of explosive Facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had 'strong evidene of foul play' relating to Gordon's role in events.

She posted: 'Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate! Especially to my family. Moreover, he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do!'

Leolah made her claims in response to being invited onto Dr Phil's show.

In her message she wrote: 'With all due respect, Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece….We have strong evidence of foul play.'

Marks were found on her face and arms, marks that Gordon has explained as the result of CPR which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived.

And speaking to Dr Phil, Gordon insisted: 'I did everything possible in the world to protect them [Whitney and Bobbi Kristina].'

Railing against the decision by Bobbi's father, Bobby Brown, to ban him from his fiancée's bedside at Atlanta's Emory Hospital, Gordon said: 'My name will be the first she calls.'

According to his mother, Michelle, Gordon cannot forgive himself for his 'failure' to revive Bobbi Kristina. His guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier.

'I hate Bobby Brown!' His tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend's father Bobby Brown, who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital

Then, on 11 February 2012, it was Gordon who tried to resuscitate Whitney when she was found unresponsive in her bath-tub just hours before she was due to attend a Grammy awards party.

Speaking to Dr Phil, Michelle said: 'Nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed Whitney.

'He administered CPR [to Whitney] and he called me when he was standing over her body. He couldn't understand why he couldn't revive her. He said, "Mommy why? I couldn't get the air into her lungs."

Gordon has now entered a rehab facility in Atlanta. Meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma.

It is now six weeks since Bobbi Kristina – Krissi as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub of the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell, Georgia.

Unlike Whitney's death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation.

While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Nick, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged.

In an interview with The Sun  a friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone.

Sounding eerily similar to Bobbi's mother and father's drug-dependent relationship, the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on.

'Bobbi and Nick would spend a lot on drugs every day, it just depended on how much money they had. It wasn't unusual for them to spend $1,000 a day on drugs.

'There were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours, just lying there on the bed. There were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice. She was always covered in cigarette burns.'

Their relationship was also very volatile.

'When Whitney died Nick was left with nothing, so he knew he had to control Krissi to get access to the money. She'd do whatever he told her. 

'He was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her. They would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around.'

According to Stepho: 'But Krissi really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother. She was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her. Nick knew this and took advantage of it.'
