A local fisherman believes that trophy killings by tourists were behind the horrific mutilation and death of two large saltwater crocodiles at Dundee Beach in the Northern Territory on Wednesday. 

The NT Times reported that Darwin man Jake Hinton, 27, found the dead crocodiles while driving with his parents to go on a family fishing trip.

Hinton's father found the first one on the ground in the run off from a little creek. It was missing a head and half-skinned, but did not appear to have any bullet holes.

One crocodile had been there for a while. It was bloated and rotting

TOne of the crocodiles was missing a head and half-skinned on the ground 

The second crocodile was found by Hinton about 200m from the mouth of the Finniss River.

'I could smell this one before we saw it, it had been there for a while and was bloated,' he told the NT Times.

'This one had nothing removed from it and there was an obvious bullet wound in its skull, which is probably why they didn’t take it.

The second crocodile was found about 200m from the mouth of the Finniss River

'I think it’s just senseless joy killing by idiot tourists looking for a trophy.'

A spokeswoman for the Parks and Wildlife Commission said the department was investigating the incidents.

The authority had 10 reports of crocodiles being slaughtered illegally in the NT over the past year.
