Photojournalist: Bill Eppridge holds the camera that he took the iconic photograph with of a dying Robert F Kennedy on June 5, 1968. Eppridge died on Thursday at age 75

Photojournalist Bill Eppridge, whose career included capturing images of a mortally-wounded Robert F. Kennedy, has died at age 75.

Eppridge died on Thursday at a Danbury hospital in Connecticut after a brief illness, said his wife, Adrienne Aurichio.

Eppridge was at the scene on June 5, 1968, when Kennedy, then a US senator who had just won California's Democratic presidential primary, had addressed campaign supporters at a Los Angeles hotel and was walking through its kitchen when shots rang out.

He was hit in the head and neck and died 26 hours later from his wounds.

He took some of the most well-known images after Kennedy was shot.

One of those images, published in Life magazine, showed Kennedy lying on the floor in a pool of his blood, a hotel employee kneeling next to him.

Eppridge's career also included stints working for high-profile magazines such as Sports Illustrated and National Geographic.

He photographed a wide range of subjects, including the Beatles, the Soviet Union, the Vietnam War, the Olympics and Woodstock.

Eppridge, who lived in Connecticut, always had a camera with him, Aurichio said.

‘He was a photojournalist to the end,’ she told CBS News.

A book of Eppridge's photographs of the Fab Four, "The Beatles: Six Days That Changed the World. February, 1964" (Rizzoli), is coming out early next year.

Rizzoli Books editor Robb Pearlman said of Eppridge, ‘He was an amazing photographer, but more than that, a gentleman and a mensch. 

He told us amazing stories about his time at Life Magazine, sometimes several times over, but they never got old.’

Eppridge's funeral will be private, with a memorial service to follow, she said.
