In the week that Nasa is celebrating the 45th anniversary of the first moon landing, one Japanese artist has taken on a pioneering space endeavour of his own by sending plant life to the edge of space.

Azuma Makato, a 38-year-old from Tokyo, sent a bonsai tree and a flower arrangement into the upper atmosphere to witness what would happen.

The results are a stunning cascade of colour and beauty as the plant life soars towards the cosmos, before the inevitable pop of the helium balloons that took them there brings them crashing back to Earth.

World View Enterprises is offering balloon flights to the ‘edge of space’ for £45,000 ($75,000).

Beginning in 2016, the Arizona-based company will take paying customers in a pressurised capsule to a height of 19 miles (30 kilometres).

In 2016 the parafoil, together with a high-altitude balloon, will be used to take pressurised capsules known as ‘Voyagers’ on trips to the edge of space.

This will give six passengers two hours of 'cruising' during which they will be free to stroll around the ‘luxury’ capsule - which even has a bar and internet access.

Makoto launched the two botanical objects from the Black Rock Desert in Nevada on 15 July 2014, reports the New York Times.

‘Flowers aren’t just beautiful to show on tables,’ he said.

‘I wanted to see the movement and beauty of plants and flowers suspended in space.’

With the help of his 10-person crew and Sacramento’s JP Aerospace, Makoto set about designing the structures and setting up the cameras that would make the mission called Exobiotanica a success.

Two separate balloons were used to take the bouquet and bonsai tree into the upper atmosphere.

The first, carrying the bonsai, rose to a height of 91,800ft (28,000 metres) in 100 minutes before the helium balloon burst.

The bouquet was composed of 30 types of flower including peace lilies, dahlias and orchids and reached a height of about 87,000 feet (26,500 metres)

It then fell to Earth for 40 minutes before parachutes opened and brought it to the ground.

The second balloon, carrying the bouquet, made it to about 87,000ft (26,500 metres) in a similar time.

The cameras used to capture the incredible shots from high altitude were six GoPro video cameras, donated by Fujifilm.

Makoto explained that the bright colours were intended to contrast against the blackness of space.

A six-rod axis was used to hold all of the different flowers in place while they ascended into the atmosphere.

The bonsai used, meanwhile, was a 50-year-old pine that was flown to Nevada from Tokyo.

This was then suspended in a light metal frame.

Despite having a tracker on each structure that launched into space, neither was found after the launch to the edge of space.

Makoto, however, heralded the mission a great success.

When the balloons burst both bonsai and bouquet descended under parachute, but neither were found and recovered
