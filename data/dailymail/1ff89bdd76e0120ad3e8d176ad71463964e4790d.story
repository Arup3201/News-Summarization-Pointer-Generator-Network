Abusive text messages sent to the forewoman of the jury during the Shane Chartres-Abbott murder trial is under investigation by Victorian police.

Three men were found not guilty today of murdering self-proclaimed vampire gigolo Shane Chartres-Abbott outside his home in Melbourne's north more than a decade ago. 

During the trial, while the jury was absent on June 19, Justice Lex Lasry told lawyers the forewoman received  threatening messages from a man she knew who was in prison the ABC reported.

The forewoman was then stood down from the trial.

Justice Lasry said the man allegedly sending the texts accused the juror of 'wrecking his life' and made reference to Goussis, one of the men standing trial for murder.

Warren Shea, 42, was one of three men found not guilty of murdering self-proclaimed vampire gigolo Shane Chartres-Abbott in 2003. He walked free from the Victorian Supreme Court on Tuesday morning

Justice Lasry said there was no suggestion that Goussis was behind the messages, but it was possible that the man sending the messages had a connection to him.

Justice Lasry described the texts as 'pathetic and cowardly' and appeared to be contempt of court.

Mr Chartres-Abbott, 28, was gunned down outside his Reservoir home on June 4, 2003 while on trial for raping a female client and biting off part of her tongue.

The woman's former boyfriend Mark Adrian Perry, 46, and two other men, Warren Shea, 42, and Evangelos Goussis, 46, pleaded not guilty to his murder.

A career criminal, who cannot be named, claimed he gunned down Mr Chartres-Abbott to even the score for the alleged rape and said the three men were involved in the murder.

The criminal said Mr Goussis was with him when he shot Mr Chartres-Abbott with a .357 magnum, the Victorian Supreme Court heard.

But this morning the jury returned not guilty verdicts for all three men following their two-month trial.

During the trial the jury heard Mr Chartres-Abbott told his alleged victim he was a vampire who needed to drink blood to survive, and he was 'older than the city of Melbourne'.

The jury deliberated for four and a half days before returning their verdict.

Prosecutor Andrew Tinney SC told the trial Perry was enraged about the attack on his ex-girlfriend and set the hit in motion by contacting his friend.

'The murder was carried out for perhaps the oldest and most powerful reason - vengeance,' he said.

Mr Tinney argued that even though Perry, Shea or Goussis weren't the ones to pull the trigger, they were part of a joint criminal enterprise that led to Mr Chartres-Abbott's death.

'Each is as guilty of the murder of Shane Chartres-Abbott as the man who pulled the trigger,' he said.

The woman's former boyfriend Mark Adrian Perry, 46, was also cleared of both murder and the alternative charge of manslaughter

Barristers for each of Perry, Shea and Goussis said the man who cannot be named was a liar, and their clients had nothing to do with the death.

Supporters of the men cheered as the verdicts were delivered and applauded the jury members as they left the court room.

Goussis wept and mouthed his thanks to the jury while holding his hand over his heart.

He is serving a 30-year prison sentence for the murders of gangland figures Lewis Moran and Lewis Caine, but the verdicts leave Perry and Shea free to walk from court.

The jury found the trio not guilty of both murder and the alternative charge of manslaughter.
