Labour leader Ed Miliband played football with children at the Khan al-Ahmer Bedouin camp. Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander, left, also took part in the kickabout

Ed Miliband took a break from his busy schedule on the final day of his Israeli tour to showcase his footballing prowess.

The Labour leader, a Leeds United fan, took part in the kickabout with local children on a visit to the Khan al-Ahmar Bedouin community in the West Bank.

Other member of the touring party, including Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander, took part in the game before Mr Miliband met with the community's leader Abu Khamis.

He used the opportunity to condemn the expansion of Israeli settlements in the region, claiming they were 'wrong and illegal' and posed a 'mortal threat' to any hope of a two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.

While Mr Miliband reaffirmed his support for a 'homeland for the Jewish people', he made it clear this did not translate into an unwavering backing for the actions of the Israeli government.

The 2,300 Palestinians living in the Khan al-Ahmar camp face forced displacement if Israeli settlements go ahead.

The Labour leader said: 'What I have seen today shows that the expansion of Israeli settlements on the Palestinian West Bank is not only wrong and illegal but represents a mortal threat to the two-state solution and to a successful outcome of the peace process.

'If we are going to have a viable, democratic Palestinian state the more we see an expansion of settlements the more it becomes difficult to construct this state.'

The Labour leader said that while he supports the existence of a 'homeland for the Jewish people', this does not translate to blanket support for the Israeli administration and its policies

This was the last day of Mr Miliband's three-day tour of Israel with his wife Justine, centre, and several key Labour Party figures

Tonight will be the last evening of the tour and Mr Miliband will spend it in Ramallah, in central West Bank. He is the first leading British politician to spend a night in the area, as security concerns have previously made it impossible.

Mr Miliband has already held talks with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and will meet with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas before he leaves tomorrow.
