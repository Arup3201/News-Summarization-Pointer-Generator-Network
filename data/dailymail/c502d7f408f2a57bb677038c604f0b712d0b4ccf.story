Former world No 3 Nikolay Davydenko has announced his retirement from tennis.

The 33-year-old announced his decision at a press conference during the Kremlin Cup in Moscow on Thursday.

The Russian, who has not played since the French Open, said: 'Unfortunately, for some years now, I have been struggling with injuries.

'It's hard for me to talk about it. I have been thinking when to announce it. The time has come. I have my whole life to live. I officially announce my retirement from professional tennis.

'I decided to retire in June after Roland Garros. I felt I could not play at the level I used to play at. I practised twice a day, but I felt I couldn't achieve the result I wanted. But I was waiting for the moment when I would wake up and say to myself it was enough.'

At 5ft 10in and 11 stone, Davydenko cut a slight figure in the modern game but overcame his physical disadvantage with superb fitness, dogged determination, speed and terrific ball striking.

He first broke into the top 10 in 2005 and was a virtual ever present for the next five years.

The best week of his career came in 2009 at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals, the first year it was held at London's O2 Arena.

Davydenko beat Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Juan Martin del Potro to become one of the tournament's more unlikely winners.

He also won three Masters series titles and reached four grand slam semi-finals, losing three times to Roger Federer and once to Mariano Puerta, as well as helping Russia win the Davis Cup in 2006.

His darkest period came in 2007 when he was investigated over possible match-fixing but he was cleared of any wrong-doing a year later.

'I won 21 ATP World Tour tournaments, including three Masters 1000 tournaments, and the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in London,' said Davydenko.

'I don't have any regrets about not winning a grand slam or not being number one in the world. I was in the top 10 for some years.'

Davydenko, meanwhile, retires as the only player ever to hold a winning record against Nadal having played him more than 10 times.

The 33-year-old, who has a young daughter, said he plans to work in business and finance.
