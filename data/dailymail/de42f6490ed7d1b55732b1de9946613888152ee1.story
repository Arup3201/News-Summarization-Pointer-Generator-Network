Brendan Rodgers is under serious pressure for the first time in his reign as Liverpool manager.

There is no suggestion that the worst Champions League campaign in the club’s history will cost Rodgers his job, as he retains Fenway Sports Group’s full support. But, after Tuesday’s insipid 1-1 draw with Basle, Rodgers accepted that the scrutiny on him is building with each bad result.

Somehow he must reverse the negative spiral Liverpool are in, particularly as the next three games — clashes with Manchester United and Arsenal in the Barclays Premier League sandwich a Capital One Cup quarter-final at Bournemouth — are pivotal. Sportsmail examines the key issues.

WHAT IS HIS BEST TEAM?

After spending in excess of £100million last summer, you would think there would be some stability to the sides Rodgers is sending out. The reality, however, is different. Liverpool have played 23 games in all competitions this season and Rodgers has named 23 different selections.

Not since Liverpool were beaten 2-0 by Chelsea on April 27 — the game that ultimately cost them the Barclays Premier League title — has Rodgers named the same team, and the leaky defence has been subject to constant change.

The concern at the moment is that no matter what personnel or system Rodgers deploys, performances are not improving. Is there an argument for him to put his faith in a certain 11 and formation and persist until results change?

‘If you need to win, why not put them under pressure from the word go?’ said former Liverpool boss Roy Evans. ‘We waited until we were down to 10 men with 20 minutes to go, then threw everything at them. Why not do it from the start? The way we approached the game was a bit negative.’

CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE

When results are good, harmony reigns. Once they begin to tail off, though, the ambience dips and the manner in which Liverpool’s fortunes have plummeted this season has had an impact on the morale of the squad.

So assured when they were on top of their game last year, the team’s faltering confidence has now eroded performance levels. That was never more apparent than after 42 seconds against Basle when Simon Mignolet, Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren passed the ball as if it was a hot potato.

The dressing room was, once again, very subdued after their exit from the Champions League and Rodgers will be aware of how crucial it is to Liverpool’s fortunes not to let the atmosphere fester. He sets the tone at Melwood and he must remain on the front foot.

ADD SOME AGGRESSION

The mood around Anfield changed for the better in the 62nd minute against Basle when Steven Gerrard thundered into a challenge and emerged with the ball. Liverpool supporters like good footballers but they also like players with a mean streak.

Are Liverpool too soft? It could be that they are too nice. When they played Real Madrid at Anfield, they barely laid a glove on the champions and never threatened to make things uncomfortable. That criticism has been recurring.

One player who has been missed and would give Liverpool an ‘edge’ is injured defender Jon Flanagan. They could do with someone else to give them steel. Liverpool don’t have huge sums to spend in January but, perhaps, whatever cash there is should go on an enforcer.

RIDE OUT THE STORM

Rodgers has made a point of saying that some defeats ‘can be the making’ of you but there is no doubt the criticism of his team, results and himself will be stinging him. Take this from Steve Nicol, whose medals in a 13-year Anfield career include a European Cup.

‘If things don’t change then ultimately Brendan will pay the price,’ said Nicol. ‘If this team keeps performing the way they are, I don’t think they’ll have another option. We are not even halfway through and most people don’t expect Liverpool to get into the top four.

‘You wonder where this team are going. He has tried to add to the squad to make it better. Somehow it has turned the other way. The team are completely rudderless. They don’t look to have any imagination going forward and defensively they look at odds. This is a desperate time for Liverpool.’

The reaction on social media and radio phone-ins saw some supporters ask for him to be removed, less than seven months after being named LMA Manager of the Year, but there is no chance owners FSG will dispense with him soon after giving him a new contract.

What they do expect, is to be back in the top four come May. If Rodgers is to achieve that, he needs to get results. Fast.
