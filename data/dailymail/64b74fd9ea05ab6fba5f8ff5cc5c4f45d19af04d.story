Louis van Gaal appears to have ignored the desperate pleas of Manchester United fans to strengthen his central defence and midfield in favour of bringing Radamel Falcao to Old Trafford.

The Colombian striker will undoubtedly improve United's attacking options this season, but where does he fit in the Dutchman's preferred formation?

Falcao, who will put pen to paper on a season-long loan deal for a fee of £12million before the transfer window closes, isn't a versatile player. He must play centrally and Van Gaal knows that.

But how about senior forwards Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie? And where does former club record signing Juan Mata now stand? The Red Devils look suspect at the back, but going forward they have enough firepower to trouble anyone.

The challenge now facing United's manager is fitting that talented quartet on the same pitch in a system that he not only likes, but which brings the best out of each individual.

With his 3-5-2 failing to deliver a victory in four games so far this season, Van Gaal may consider utilising a new formation to put his summer acquisitions to good use.

The 63-year-old has experienced success - most notably at this summer's World Cup with Holland - using three central defenders, but he lacks the necessary quality in that area of the pitch at United to persist with it.

With Luke Shaw and Rafael being more accustomed to traditional full back roles too, a 4-3-1-2 system looks a more likely option as Van Gaal settles in at Old Trafford. Phil Jones and summer signing Marcos Rojo should fill the central defensive berths.

How Manchester United could line up with Falcao

That would give United a midfield three of Ander Herrera, Daley Blind and big-money buy Angel di Maria - an attractive mix of pace, passing ability and defensive nous.

That leaves four players - Falcao, Rooney, Van Persie and Mata - battling for three spaces at the top end of the pitch. Unfortunately for the Spaniard, he appears to be the odd one out.

As shown by his promotion to club captain, Rooney is seen as a central figure by Van Gaal. He has played as a striker in each of United's three league games so far, but remains the most adaptable of the former Bayern Munich boss' options.

Dropping the England skipper back into the No 10 role would give him the regular football he craves, while allowing Falcao to play in his natural position - up-front alongside Van Persie. It would, however, leave £37m Mata as a peripheral figure.

Van Persie - like Falcao - is at his most dangerous when played in the middle as the furthest man forward. The pair of them together have the potential to become the top-flight's most dangerous partnership, helping negate any shakiness in the new-look back four with the promise of goals, goals and goals.

Whether Rooney will be content to drop further back remains to be seen, but he may have no option given the excessive loan fee executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has allowed to be spent on a man who was also a target for rivals Manchester City and La Liga giants Real Madrid.

Odd one out: Juan Mata (right) faces a battle to start for United after the arrival of Falcao

Mata left Chelsea in January in search of regular football but after struggling in Saturday's 0-0 draw with Burnley, it already looks like he'll have a fight on his hands to nail down a regular spot in Van Gaal's first XI.

Rooney will play as captain, Van Persie is one of his manager's most trusted players and you don't sign one of the world's best strikers to let him sit on the bench.

With Di Maria also providing attacking thrust from midfield, United fans will be excited at the prospect of their revamped attack helping turn around a disappointing start to the campaign.

Unfortunately for Mata, the arrival of Falcao could well mean he is no longer a part of it.
