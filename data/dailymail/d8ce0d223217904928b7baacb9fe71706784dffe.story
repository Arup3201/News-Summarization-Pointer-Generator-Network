A campaign to save a pit bull that viciously attacked a four-year-old Arizona boy now has almost 45,000 signatures from supporters around the world who don't want the dog to be put down.

The fate of Mickey, a five-year-old pit bull terrier, was supposed to be decided on March 4, but a restraining order against his euthanasia was extended until a decision can be made about his fate.

Mickey was chained in his own South Phoenix backyard when four-year-old Kevin Vicente reached for a bone lying nearby and was attacked by Mickey. His facial injuries were severe and he faces multiple surgeries and permanent scarring.

AZ Central reports that Kevin Vicente's injuries were so bad that hospital workers were traumatized after seeing them. He eats and breaths through tubes

According to My Fox Phoenix, Kevin Vicente was at the home of the dog's owner with his babysitter.

Supporters of Mickey say the boy shouldn't have been in the yard with the dog, and that Mickey was behaving instinctively because he believed the child was taking away his food.

On the contrary, a witness, Guadalupe Villa, says the dog attacked the boy not in warning but to inflict damage.

Supporters: Protesters against putting Mickey down turned out in support of the dog

'Mickey wasn't just biting to bite, he was shaking his head, trying to hurt,' Villa told My Fox Phoenix.

Villa
 said the dog belonged to her boyfriend and that she has known Mickey 
since he was a puppy. Six months ago, she says, Mickey attacked and 
killed a puppy that wandered into the yard.

'Honestly, I just want him to be put down,' she says.

'Crazy how [the campaign to save Mickey] elevated in last two weeks.. people around the world are trying to save him. They don't know the dog.'

Villa filed the vicious dog petition with the city, and her boyfriend surrendered the dog to animal control.

Mickey has retained a crack team of lawyers who volunteered to represent him at a superior court hearing.

'The dog has no voice at this time.  The owner didn't want to be the voice of the dog.  They surrendered it to animal control, so we're stepping in to defend Mickey,' John Schill of the Schill Law Group told My Fox Phoenix.

While a Facebook page dedicated to Mickey has in excess of 40,000 likes, a Facebook page for the support of Kevin Vicente has barely 500.

A fundraising website to help Kevin's mother pay for his medical expenses has so far raised just over $6,000.

Flor Medrano, a family friend, said Kevin’s mother, a single parent, had to quit her job to take care of her son full time. With no other family in the U.S., Medrano said, the mother needs support, but people are more interested in a dog than a little boy.

'We feel sad because they care more about Mickey,' Medrano told AZ Central. 'They’re saying that it was Kevin’s fault because he was spoiled, and they don’t even know Kevin. And they don’t even know the dog, either.'

A hearing is set for March 25.
