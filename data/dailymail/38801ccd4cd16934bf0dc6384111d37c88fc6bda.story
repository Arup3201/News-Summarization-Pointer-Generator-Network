A man hired to work in a shop after he suffered financial problems tipped-off two criminals who stole £12,500 from the owner's cousin who was carrying the the takings home.

Anthony Underdown approached shopkeeper Zahid Akhter for a job to pay back money he owed following a county court judgement.

Preston Crown Court heard that Underdown was 'unhappy with his working conditions'  after three years working at the Nisa supermarket in Ribbleton, Lancashire and wanted 'revenge' on the owner.

Preston Crown Court heard that Underdown continued to work at the Nisa Extra store in Ribbleton, Lancs, pictured, after robbery and even played with the owner's children

Underdown passed on information to criminals Thomas Lynch and Martin McDermott  who trailed the owner's cousin, Qaiser Mehboob, 30, from the shop when he was carrying £12,500 takings.

The 27-year-old  was jailed for 16 months after he pleaded guilty to assisting in the commission of a robbery in Accrington, Lancashire in June 2013.

Prosecuting, Hanifa Patel said Underdown was caught out by mobile phone evidence linking him to the robbers.

She added: 'The victim arrived outside his home at 11.45pm and as he got out of his car he was approached by McDermott and Lynch.

'They began to hit him all over, the face the head and the body. As one hit him the other tried to snatch the takings. The victim gave chase and was struck again and that caused him to stop.'

Underdown's solicitor Adrian Williams said: 'He’s not a sophisticated man. He has not been before a court and has no convictions.

'It’s my submission Lynch and McDermott had planned a robbery and befriended the defendant. He’s been incredibly foolish and deeply regrets what he’s done.'

Judge Anthony Russell told Underdown: 'It must be understood those who give information to criminals to enable them to commit crime will receive punishment.

'You later told police there was an element of revenge.

'The robbery may not have occurred had you not given that information.

'It’s very sad to see a man with an exemplary character other than this before the court facing such a serious charge.'

McDermott was ordered to pay Mr Akhter £7,040 compensation following a Proceeds of Crime hearing.

Preston Crown Court heard that McDermott, 25, of Fulwood, Lancs and Lynch, 26, currently in HMP Preston are already serving 40 months and four years respectively for the robbery.

Mr Akhter told the court: 'I had helped him out financially when he got into trouble with a County Court Judgement.

'I feel totally betrayed, and it has made me not trust other people, which isn’t nice. I was shocked when I found he was involved.'

His wife, Shazia Akhter added: 'After the robbery he carried on working for us, playing with our children when they came into the shop.'
