Four football fans, said to be Chelsea supporters, were ordered off a train on Sunday night following claims they were making racist chants.

The group were evicted from a Euston to Manchester service after the Capital One Cup final at 10.30pm.

Transport police were called to the service and boarded at Stoke following complaints from other passengers where they threw the supporters off.

One witness told Sportsmail: 'It was horrendous. They were Chelsea fans and they were being nasty and offensive. One passenger, a black man, moved carriages because he was disgusted with them.

'One girl was crying. The police got on and marched them off the train.'

Another witness said the fans were asking two young Asian girls where their burkas were and singing songs about Spurs and Auschwitz.

A Chelsea spokesman said: 'We're not aware of any evidence to suggest that these were Chelsea supporters. But if they are we will assist the British Transport Police with their enquiries.'

The incident comes after footage emerged of Chelsea fans on the Paris Metro refusing to allow a black man to enter their carriage before a Champions League clash.

The clip also captures a number of Chelsea supporters making a racist chant.

Following the incident the Metropolitan Police passed on the details of the three men to the authorities in France, who are investigating.

Chelsea has suspended five fans and said it would ban them from attending Stamford Bridge for life if there was sufficient evidence of their involvement.

Referring to the latest allegations, a British Transport Police spokesman said: 'Shortly after 10.30pm on Sunday, 1 March, officers were called to meet a Euston-to-Manchester Piccadilly train at Stoke, following reports of racist and abusive behaviour by a number of passengers, said to be football fans.

'Colleagues from Staffordshire Police also attended. Officers asked four men to leave the train at Stoke. We have spoken to two witnesses, and investigations continue.

'Rail passengers and staff have the right to travel and work in peace. Abusive behaviour on trains and at stations is unacceptable, and we will not hesitate to investigate any such incidents.'
