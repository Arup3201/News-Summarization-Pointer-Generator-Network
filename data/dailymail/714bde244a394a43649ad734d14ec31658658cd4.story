George Clooney has set a date for his wedding to beautiful human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin – just a week after popping the question.

According to a close friend of Amal, she is poised to send out save the date cards warning friends and family they will need to fly to Italy and then to Lebanon in September.

‘September 12 is the date they are aiming for,’ said the friend of Lebanese born, British raised Amal, 35.

It's on: The couple look set to get married on September 12, according to a close friend of Amal Alamuddin

‘Everyone thinks they will marry in Lake Como where George owns a beautiful home but Amal feels that is too public.

'They are looking to host a small wedding in an Italian village where they can control the photographers. But they haven’t decided yet.

'They will then have big parties for her relatives in Lebanon and London.’

George, 53, wooed Amal after meeting her last September – so the wedding will fall on their one year anniversary.
