The professional body  representing GPs has demanded the Government scrap its NHS reforms, warning that they will cause ‘irreparable damage’ to patient care.

Members of the Royal College of General Practitioners have written to the Prime Minister declaring their outright opposition to the plans.

It will be seen as a major setback for the Government as GPs are meant to be the main beneficiaries of the controversial reforms, which would hand them direct control over NHS services and budgets in their local area.

The College has written to David Cameron (pictured washing his hands at the Royal Salford Hospital in Manchester) asking the Prime Minister to scrap the bill

But in recent weeks, ministers have 
faced growing opposition from the medical profession, with the British 
Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College 
of Midwives among the groups calling for the reforms to be ditched.

Yesterday, RCGP chairman Dr Clare Gerada, who represents 34,000 doctors 
in England, told Radio 4’s Today programme that the Health and Social 
Care Bill would ‘turn the National Health Service into thousands of 
different health services, all competing for the same patients, the same
knee, the same brain, the same heart.

Dr Clare Gerada said their concerns from 18 months ago had still not been addressed

‘Patients will find their care fragmented, it will be on different 
sites, it won’t join up, it will be  difficult to hand over care and it 
will be phenomenally expensive to keep track of all these competing 
parts of the NHS.’

She added: ‘We cannot sit back. We must raise our concerns in the hope 
that the Prime Minister will halt this damaging, unnecessary and 
expensive reorganisation which, in our view, risks leaving the poorest 
and most vulnerable in society to bear the brunt.’

The Bill, which does not affect Wales or Scotland, is now going through 
the House of Lords and  hinges on abolishing large primary care trusts 
and giving GPs control of NHS budgets to let them decide which 
treatments and services will be provided within their area.

Earlier this week, Health Secretary Andrew Lansley made 137 amendments 
to the Bill in the hope of appeasing members of the House of Lords, who 
are due to debate it further next week.

Health Minister Simon Burns said: ‘It is disappointing that Clare Gerada
has taken this step, but it hardly comes as a surprise given her 
outspoken opposition to our plans to improve the NHS. Any reform causes 
controversy and there is always going to be disagreement about the best 
way to modernise the NHS.

‘But only yesterday the Family Doctor Association, representing over 
1,000 practices in the UK, came out in support for our plans. We have 
been carefully listening to the ideas raised as the Bill has progressed 
through Parliament, and as a result we tabled a series of amendments to 
safeguard the future of the NHS.’

The Bill also sets out to encourage more competition within the NHS in 
the hope it will drive up standards, with hospitals, private firms and 
charities all vying to treat patients.

But from the outset it has been heavily opposed by medical workers, charities and even MPs from within the Government.

And yesterday the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy also called for the
Bill to be scrapped, saying that even Mr Lansley’s latest changes did 
not address its concerns.

Last month, Dr Hamish Meldrum, chairman of the British Medical 
Association’s council, warned that if the reforms went ahead the NHS 
could face scandals on the scale of those that occurred at Mid 
Staffordshire NHS Trust in 2010, when up to 1,200 patients died from 
poor care as staff put government targets and cost-cutting ahead of 
patient care.

The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives also 
warned the upheaval caused by the reforms would add to financial 
pressures and put patient safety at risk.
