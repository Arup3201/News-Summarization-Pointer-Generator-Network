A senior Tory MP is to study a dossier of secret emails in an investigation into a £5 billion deal plotted by two disgraced Conservatives on the public payroll.

The inquiry has been ordered by former Tory Minister Henry Bellingham, who is responsible for the Policy Research Unit (PRU), which advises Conservative MPs and is funded by their Parliamentary expenses.

Mr Bellingham acted after The Mail on Sunday revealed PRU boss Iain Corby emailed Tony Caplin, a crony of David Cameron, from his official Parliamentary account, suggesting they could both make money from a £5 billion investment project.

Mr Corby, who ran the PRU for six years, was fired on the orders of No 10 last month after claims he was guilty of misconduct over a sex texts scandal. Mr Caplin was sacked as the head of a £60 billion Treasury quango after a separate investigation by this newspaper revealed how the Prime Minister gave him the job despite the fact he had been declared bankrupt for not paying his taxes.

Mr Bellingham told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have asked to look at all Mr Corby’s emails to see if this was a one-off or part of a pattern of outside activities. I am determined to establish the truth. The PRU is funded by taxpayers. If anyone is dealing in shares or other commercial activities, they should not be doing it via the PRU.’

PRU director Eoghan Williams, appointed to clean it up after Mr Corby’s abrupt departure, is compiling a dossier of the messages. The email concerning the £5 billion deal was sent to Mr Caplin from Mr Corby’s PRU email address.

Headed ‘spending some cash,’ it was sent in March 2013, ten months after Mr Caplin, a member of the Public Works Loans Board (PWLB), which controls £60 billion of loans to town halls, was declared bankrupt. Four months later, Mr Cameron promoted him to the post of Board chairman.

Mr Caplin and Mr Corby had access to privileged Government information as a result of their positions.

Two other powerful groups of MPs, the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Administration Committee,  are also expected to discuss the allegations concerning Mr Caplin this week.

Downing Street last night admitted no checks were carried out on Mr  Caplin before his appointment as head of the PWLB last year. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood said in a letter to Labour Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie: ‘Mr Caplin should have told the Treasury he was bankrupt.’

Tory ‘quango king’ Mr Caplin is the former boss of stockbroker Panmure Gordon, where the Prime Minister’s father, Ian, was one of three generations of Camerons to work. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude is a former business associate of Mr Caplin and gave him a top Tory HQ post.

Further details of how Mr Caplin cheated friends as he tried to avoid bankruptcy and public disgrace emerged last night. ‘He borrowed more and more money from friends to pay off other debts without telling them he was going broke – like using one credit card to pay off another – but it collapsed,’ said one.
