Legia Warsaw  was fined 80,000 euros (£63,389) after their fans displayed a banner criticising UEFA.

A statement on the club's website revealed that UEFA's disciplinary panel imposed the sanction after a hearing on Thursday.

Legia fans protested the club's disputed exit from the Champions League at a Europa League play-off against Aktobe of Kazakhstan last week.

The banner, surrounded by lit flares, showed a large pig imposed on a UEFA badge and the slogan: 'Because Football Doesn't Matter, Money Does.'

Legia was eliminated from the Champions League third qualifying round after fielding a suspended player against Celtic during a 6-1 aggregate win.

UEFA awarded the Scottish side a 3-0 second-leg win that saw it advance. Legia is seeking compensation from UEFA at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. 

Unfortunately for Scottish football fans, Celtic failed to even capitalise on their good fortune, and were beaten 2-1 on aggregate by Maribor in the final Champions League play-off round.

Manager: Henning Berg is Legia's manager and may feel aggrieved that he is not in the Champions League
