An NBC news crew that was exposed to a cameraman with the deadly Ebola virus has been forced to undergo a mandatory quarantine.

The group, which includes chief medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman had been asked to isolate itself for 21 days  after their colleague Ashoka Mukpo was diagnosed with Ebola this month.

But someone in the NBC crew violated the voluntary agreement forcing New Jersey officials to step in and issue a mandatory quarantine order on Friday night.

Tweet: Snyderman tweeted from Liberia describing a report scheduled for NBC about a woman with Ebola 

Officials confirmed that the order went into effect yesterday. 

Yet, the state Health Department insists that the crew remains symptom-free and there is no reason for concern of exposure to the deadly virus to the community. 

It comes as new medical screenings are rolled out at airports across the United States to stem the spread of the disease.

Anybody flying from western Africa who has a fever will be interviewed to see whether they have had contact with an Ebola sufferer, and from there can be quarantined if necessary. 

The NBC group was reporting on the Ebola outbreak for NBC News in Liberia when Mukpo was diagnosed with the deadly virus just a day after he was hired to work on the team. 

The cameraman was infected in West Africa, but is being treated in Nebraska.    

A spokesman for NBC told The AP that the network could not comment on any individual case, but noted that the team was deemed to be low-risk upon its return from Liberia.

He added that they had agreed  to follow the guidelines set by local health authorities which included the 21-day isolation period.

He said: 'We fully support those guidelines and continue to expect that they be followed.'

'Our team are all well with normal temperatures, which they check multiple times a day, and they are also in daily contact with local health officials.' 

Meanwhile, in a phone interview with the Today show last week, Snyderman said all the gear she and her crew used was being disinfected because they all shared work space and vehicles.

She also said that she believed she and her team were at a low risk because they have been 'hyper-vigilant.'

The number of deaths attributed to the current Ebola outbreak has climbed to 4,033, according to the World Health Organization. 

This brings the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of Ebola to 8,399.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that people exposed to the virus develop symptoms two to 21 days after their exposure.   

Today, John F Kennedy Airport begun new screenings for West African passengers flying into New York. 

High-tech: This is how the advanced thermometers will work without putting public health workers at risk

Around 150 travelers per day  from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will now be stopped and checked with contactless thermometers in an attempt to prevent the disease getting into the United States again.

The 2014 Ebola outbreak has been most prevalent in three West African countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and smaller outbreaks have been reported in both Senegal and Nigeria. 

The new scheme, which began today, will be expanded over the next week to Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport. 

President Barack Obama said Wednesday that the new screening measures are 'really just belt and suspenders' to support protections already in place.
