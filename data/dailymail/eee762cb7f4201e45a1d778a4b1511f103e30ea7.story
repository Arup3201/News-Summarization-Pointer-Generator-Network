More than 20 Tory MPs have begun talks with UKIP about forming a pact ahead of the 2015 general election, Nigel Farage claimed today.

Arriving at the Conservative conference at the centre of a media storm, Mr Farage urged Tory supporters to back UKIP in next year's European Parliament elections to trigger an earthquake in British politics.

But the idea of local agreements was rejected by George Osborne who insisted anyone caught doing deals with rival parties would not be allowed to stand on a Tory ticket.

The Tory party conference in Manchester has been dominated by UKIP today, with Mr Farage addressing three events with activists.

A growing number of Conservative MPs want to reach an agreement with UKIP to stop voters switching to the anti-EU party.

Mr Farage has refused to enter a formal electoral pact with the Conservative Party saying he is despised by David Cameron.

But he has indicated he would not stand in the way of agreements in local constituencies with the most eurosceptic MPs.

Today Mr Farage suggested there are 'a couple of dozen' Tory MPs with whom his party could come to an agreement at a local level.

'There are a couple of dozen Tory MPs who hold a range of views on several issues, not just Europe, that are very close to our own,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One.

'We have had informal discussions with a handful, no more than that.'

During a speech at a Bruges Group event later, Mr Farage criticised Mr Cameron for not keeping his pledge of a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. 'He let us down like a cheap pair of braces.'

And he called for Tory voters to back UKIP in the European Parliament elections next year: 'I have got a suggestion to all the Tory delegates here in Manchester this week and generally care about regaining British independence.

'If you want British independence you have got to vote UKIP on May 22 next year. It will up the ante and keep the pressure on for a referendum and it would force Labour into promising a referendum - and in many ways the sooner the better.'

However the Tory leadership is adamant that no-one standing for the party will be allowed to appear on the ballot paper on a joint ticket with UKIP.

Mr Osborne said: 'There aren’t going to be any deals with UKIP and there are not going to be Conservative-UKIP candidates locally.

'The only candidates who will stand for the Conservative party at the election are Conservative candidates – a sort of statement of the obvious.

'There’s a very clear rule in our country, which is that candidates have to be approved by the party and the Conservative party will be fielding Conservative-only candidates.'

The Chancellor, who has unveiled plans to force the jobless to work for their benefits, urged his party to stop obsessing with UKIP.

'The Conservative party is appealing to all parts of our country – we’re not moving to the left or the right; we are on the centre ground of British politics,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'And I think policies on immigration, welfare and Europe which are sometimes called ‘right-wing policies’ or policies that appeal to people who might be tempted to UKIP, I think they have a very broad appeal.

'I find people of all political colours worried about immigration, worried about welfare. And which party is tackling those problems? The Conservative party.'

It comes after it emerged several 
Tory MPs are planning to run on ‘joint tickets’ with UKIP at the 
election.

A handful of MPs  were said to be considering a ‘Unite the 
Right’ campaign to prevent Labour capitalising on a split vote following
a surge in support for Mr Farage’s party.

The sitting Tory MP would stand as a 
Tory-UKIP candidate. In return for its support, UKIP would expect to be 
able to influence Conservative Party policy.

Nadine
Dorries was the first to float the idea earlier this year, saying she 
would be ‘having that kind of conversation’ with activists in her 
constituency and that many Conservatives have ‘huge empathy’ with UKIP.

Eight Tory-held seats are said to be at 
high risk of being lost because of UKIP splitting the traditional Tory 
vote and letting in Labour or the Lib Dems.

Banned: UKIP leader Nigel Farage to due to appear at three events at the Tory party conference, but has been erased from the official guide

Farage has refused to enter a formal electoral pact with the Tories saying he is despised by David Cameron

David Cameron pledged yesterday to remove all commitments to ‘ever-closer union’ from EU treaties.

In a hardening of his stance, the Prime Minister said he wanted to go as far as erasing the EU’s original mission statement, which commits nations to closer integration.

He said: ‘Others can sign up to an ever-closer union, but Britain should not. I’m determined to make sure we get out of that.’ 

Speaking at the Tory Party conference, Foreign Secretary William Hague also told delegates that more countries were coming round to Britain’s view that powers should be returned to individual countries.

Mr Farage there are many MPs who take a
different view from the Tory leadership on Europe, naming Peter Bone 
and Jacob Rees-Mogg.

He 
said: ‘If either they, or others like them, even Labour MPs, with their 
local associations, chose to propose running on a joint ticket then I 
would leave the local Ukip association to have those negotiations ... 
After all we are a party that believes in real localism and doesn’t 
think that the centre is the repository of all wisdom.’

Speaking
about not being allowed into the secure zone of the Conservative Party 
Conference in Manchester Mr Farage said: ‘It seems I am persona non 
grata.’

Writing in the Times he added: ‘To the Tory High Command I am a plague carrier.’

The proposal comes as the latest YouGov poll shows Labour has surged ahead, mainly at the expense of the Conservatives who are losing voters to Ukip. The poll puts Labour on 42 per cent, the Tories on 31 per cent, UKIP on 13 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.

Miss Dorries said yesterday: ‘I know other MPs in marginal constituencies are in talks about entering into agreements. It’s going to be very difficult in the general election when you’ve got two candidates espousing the same sort of values.

‘We’ll have a Conservative candidate calling for a referendum, being strong on crime, immigration and grammar schools, and the Ukip candidate saying much the same sort of things.’

Conservative Central Office yesterday said joint tickets would not be allowed and any MP who tried would not have their nomination papers signed.

Foreign Secretary William Hague last night insisted Tories ‘don’t make pacts with other parties … we win over the voters of other parties’ and cautioned wavering supporters.

He said: ‘If someone is contemplating voting Ukip who would otherwise vote Conservative they could, by default, produce a Labour government which is the absolute opposite of what they might want on Europe for instance.’
