For one woman, sitting next to Santa Claus at a Indiana mall this week ended in a marriage proposal.

Santa popped the question to Kimberly Roberts as a pinch hitter for Sgt. Clint Underhill, WFIE reported. The soldier is currently in Afghanistan. 

Roberts' mother Kathy Ross Roberts uploaded a video of the proposal at the Eastland Mall to Facebook.

In the clip, Santa asks Kimberly what she wants for Christmas - and she replies 'I want my boyfriend to come home from Afghanistan.'

'Really? Hm, you know that's quite an honorable thing that they do to keep us free,' Santa says.

Santa then steps away for a moment and comes back with a bouquet of flowers.

Big moment: Santa Claus stepped in for Sgt. Clint Underhill and popped the question to Underhill's girlfriend Kimberly Roberts at the Eastland Mall. The soldier is currently in Afghanistan 

Couple: Sgt. Clint Underhill proposed to Kimberly Roberts via Santa Claus this week 

He then pulls a letter out of his hat, and reading it, says 'Kimberly, our time together so far has been nothing short of amazing. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't realize how lucky I have you to be in my life.

'We've had so many days apart, and we've been together through every single one of them. I'm so very grateful to have such a marvelous woman in my life.

'I cannot think of anyone else that I would rather spend the rest of my life with. You show me complete happiness and joy every single day.'

Will you marry me? Roberts said 'Yes' to Sgt. Clint Underhill's proposal after Santa pulled out a ring 

Santa continues, pulling out a ring 'I would be honored if you would accept this ring and make me happier than I've ever felt before. Will you marry me?'

Roberts cries and says 'Yes.' The crowd behind the scene later cheers at the news. 

Santa, speaking to WFIE, said of the proposal 'It's the first time that I did it long-distance, half a world away.'

He also said of about the wedding, to which he is invited, 'Are they going to have cookies along with the cake?'

Underhill told WFIE of the proposal 'I just wanted to give Kimberly the proposal she wanted, so I talked with her mom and we came up with something. And that's kind of pretty much how it all started.'

Meanwhile, his new fiance told the television station the proposal was 'Definitely the best present that I could ever ask for.'
