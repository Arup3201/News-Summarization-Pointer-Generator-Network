Menacing storm clouds gather over green fields and quiet roads, about to embark on a path of destruction.

Like a spaceship hovering above the earth, the cylindrical formation spells trouble for anything in its wake.

As it sinks closer to the earth, clouds of golden dust are kicked up beneath the gloom by the tornado's rotating force.

It's called Tornado Alley for a reason: The car and trees in this photo are dwarfed by the gigantic cloud

Storm chaser Marko Korosec, 31, was on an expedition in the USA for 26 days when he came across these cloud formations.

Marko, a system administrator for road weather information, snapped the shots of the three storms in Tornado Alley in Texas, Kansas and Colorado.

From a distance of 1km, he observed the scene for at least an hour at a time, saying the tornados ripped up trees and telephone wires on their journeys.

The alley's unique conditions mean tornados form frequently here.

Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets cold, dry air from the Rocky Mountains and Canada, creating intense, tornado-producing thunderstorms known as supercells.

Supercell storms contain a rotating tower, called a mesocyclone, giving the clouds a circular spaceship look.

Marko, from Sezana, Slovenia, said: 'Storm chasing is dangerous as intense lightning, large hail, strong winds and tornadoes could pose threats at any time.

'I usually observe storms in as safe a position as possible, to avoid any dangerous conditions which could cause us damage or to the vehicle.

'It usually takes no more than an hour to form a supercell storm which usually brings down trees amd telephone wires.

'Hail can also damage roads and buildings, so it's important to stay at least 1km away.

'Storm chasing usually means a lot of moving around, remaining in one position for some time and then moving when storm gets closer.'
