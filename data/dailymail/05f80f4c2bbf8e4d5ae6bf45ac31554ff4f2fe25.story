Paying the price: Charlotte with her charity shop 'bargains'

From the contents of my shopping basket, you’d think I’d just hit the end of the January sales. A cosy Jigsaw jacket for £25, a red Gap top for £7.99, a Monsoon frock for £25 and a Radley handbag for £40.

But, in fact, these are some of the price tags on the clothes rails of a few local charity shops near my home in Kent. What would be a bargain haul for discounted new clothes is arguably rather a high price for someone else’s cast-offs.

Certainly, the days are gone when you could pick up second-hand clothing for a couple of quid. In the stores I visited, I found dresses for £50 and £60, tops for £14.99 and worn shoes for £20, not to mention handbags from shops such as Marks & Spencer and New Look that were almost as much to buy second hand as they would be new.

In one Oxfam store, I dressed myself from top to toe in labels from a powder-blue Cath Kidston cardigan to a black evening dress with sparkly waistband by Ann Louise Roswald — but the total came to more than £100.

Perhaps no wonder, then, that charity shops stand accused of abandoning their traditional clientele.

Many shoppers believe they are turning into boutiques — with prices to match.

So, why have charity shops suddenly become so much more expensive? There’s certainly more of them than ever before.

According to the latest statistics, they outnumber shoe shops in Britain, having increased by 30 per cent over the past five years.

As their number increases, many high streets, like the High Street in Orpington, pictured, now have numerous charity shops

This boom is changing the face of our towns. Orpington High Street in Kent, for example, has 12 charity shops in one short stretch — and that includes two branches of Cancer Research UK that are almost facing each other.

While many independent shops and established chains are having a hard time of it, charity shops — staffed by volunteers and benefiting from free stock and business rate discounts — are able to expand.

Take Barnado’s, whose profits from its 538 shops have increased from just £1.8 million five years ago to £10.9 million in 2012/13. No wonder it has plans to open 87 more shops in 2014/15.

Oxfam reported sales of £90 million in 2011, an all-time record, and 5 per cent higher than the previous year.

‘The charity shop sector is going well and growing,’ says Wendy Mitchell, head of policy and public affairs at the Charity Retail Association. ‘It is partly to do with the economic climate and attracting new audiences — some one million more people.’

But as this investigation reveals, it may well be consumers who are paying the price for this success.

No one would deny the importance of the money raised by the shops — £220 million a year. Nor would anyone want to knock the sterling work of the thousands of volunteers who staff the shops.

But it does seem ironic that at a time when we are all feeling the pinch, many charity shops are more expensive than Primark. The hike in prices is certainly a hot topic of debate online, with consumers noticing a change as charity shops increasingly market themselves to a more well-heeled clientele.

Gone are the days when clothes were a ragtag assortment of sizes and colours. Now, many shops are colour coded, High Street labels are prominently displayed and prices are marked accordingly higher.

On one internet forum, a former volunteer reveals that she was put under pressure to put high price tags on good labels. ‘They have got very, very greedy,’ she confides.

Take Cranbrook in Kent. Three clothes boutiques have closed down over the past 18 months, but the number of charity shops has increased to four.

Clothes in the Oxfam branch are beautifully presented and there’s a smattering of high-end High Street labels and a few designer numbers. But they don’t come that cheap.

My eye is drawn to a Top Shop skirt priced at £5.99, which isn’t bad. But the Next polka dot blouse beside it is £7.99. There are similar chiffon tops in the Next sale for £8 and even a full-price, new blouse starts at around £20.

Then there’s an evening dress for £50 by a designer I’d never heard of and a glitzy sequin number for £60. The dress was elegant and in good condition — but £60 for a dress in  a provincial charity shop? That seems excessive when you bear in mind that it cost the charity shop nothing in the first place.

The accessories are just as pricey. I found two rather worn Marks & Spencer Limited Collection handbags for £15. You can buy a brand-new one for  just £15 more.

As I’m working my way through the rails, I hear a customer sigh: ‘Is it me or is everything in here £20?’ to which the sales assistant replies: ‘Not everything.’

Barnado's profits from its 538 shops have increased from just £1.8¿million five years ago to £10.9¿million in 2012/13. No wonder it has plans to open 87 more shops in 2014/15

But there were few bargains to be had. The only ones I saw were on a small sale rail where a lurid and well-worn floral Dorothy Perkins top originally priced at £6.99 was £1.

A few doors down, in a shop that raises money for a hospice, some of the prices were a little more reasonable, but I still found Monsoon dresses for £20, when new ones are only £40. In London, the prices are even steeper. In the Westbourne Grove branch of Oxfam, a Topshop black blazer is on sale for £32. A new equivalent would be £45. There’s also an H&M silk tunic shirt for £19. Other blouses are on sale in H&M for a full price of £19.99 — just 99p more.

There are some designer finds that are true bargains — a purple three-quarter-length sleeve Stella McCartney dress for £45 and a Marc Jacobs black tunic at £45. But in every charity shop I go to the High Street labels are hugely marked up. One has a black bodycon dress from Oasis for a staggering £95.

Karen Shoesmith, 46, a full-time mum from West London, told me: ‘I know it’s for charity, but the shops are pricing people out.’

In a Central London Oxfam, a white Primark cardigan is £12, the same price it was new.Retail expert Clare Rayner says: ‘The old way was to sell incredibly cheaply, more like a jumble sale, but there has been a huge trend shift as people have realised that the second-hand clothes market can be lucrative,’ she says.

‘Charities want to get the best price they  can for their donations.’

In other words, if the charities don’t mark up the prices, someone else will. After all, there are profits to be made on eBay and in vintage shops.

An Oxfam spokesman said: ‘We believe the best way to thank our donors for their generosity is to get the best price we can for their donations. Each shop team uses their judgment to decide prices in their location.

‘Customers know their money will be well spent to help the world’s poorest people.’

But science teacher Tina Murray, 50, is not impressed after popping into the Oxfam store on Marylebone High Street where there is a Mango dress for £50, the same price as new.

She says: ‘I’ll still donate to charity, but I’d rather go to Oxford Street than spend that much money here.’
