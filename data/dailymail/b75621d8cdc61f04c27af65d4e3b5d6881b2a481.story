These are the horrific injuries inflicted on a former soldier after he was brutally attacked on his own doorstep - when he disturbed a gang burgling his home.

Adrian Peter Percival, 59, was savagely punched, kicked and stamped on by masked men who approached him from behind as he placed his key in the front door.

It is believed he disturbed the offenders as they were coming down from a ladder they had used to break into his house in Eccles, Greater Manchester.

The ex-Royal Fusilier had his head stamped on and was struck across the face with some sort of weapon during the attack on Trafford Road in Eccles, Greater Manchester

The ex-Royal Fusilier had his head stamped on and was struck across the face with some sort of weapon before the burglars made off with his late wife's wedding ring.

As a result of the attack, he sustained severe bruising and swelling and suspected broken bones to his face, as well as injuries to his torso and legs and substantial bruising to his right lung.

He later discovered the thieves had stolen a green metal box containing the cash he had saved up to visit his son in Latvia and a gold Irish wedding band with Celtic knots which belonged to his late wife, as well as a Manchester United gold centenary medal with a gold chain.

He was first attacked by a masked man before two other accomplices clad in balaclava joined in the assault, which happened around 10.30pm on September 13 outside his home.

Although he was only able to get a fleeting glance, one of the offenders is described as being of a stocky build, 6ft tall and wearing dark clothing.

Another was of a slimmer build and also wearing dark clothing.

Detective Constable Horace Bell said: 'This poor man has suffered tremendously at the hands of these absolute cowards, who have cruelly deprived him of the things he holds most dear.

'They stole his late wife's wedding ring which is an appalling and wicked act. 

Mr Percival sustained severe bruising and swelling and suspected broken bones to his face, as well as injuries to his torso, arms and legs

'But not content with that, they also stole cash he had saved up to pay to visit his son in Latvia.

'It would be hard to describe the anguish he is currently going through and I'm sure people's hearts will go out to him.

'This man served his country with distinction, fighting to protect others, only to be savagely beaten by three vindictive, violent and disrespectful low-lives who deserve to be locked up.

'I would appeal to anyone who has information about this burglary and assault to come forward.

'In particular, I would ask that if anyone is offered these pieces of jewellery that they call us immediately as you could be being offered this man's wedding ring.

'The very least he deserves is to be reunited with the possessions he treasures most and a physical memento of his late wife.

'I would also hope that if the thieves are reading or hearing this appeal, that they too show a shred of decency and at the very least hand this ring into a local police station and spare this man's heartbreak.'

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
