An extreme islamist group in Syria has posted a video of a British jihadi urging others from his home country to join him.

The unidentified man speaks with a London accent when he calls for his ‘brothers and sisters’ in Britain to join in Syria’s civil war.

The video has been posted by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a group so extreme Al-Qaeda officially disowned them earlier this year.

Jihadi recruitment: The video,  entitled 'UK brothers in Syria', starts with a man speaking English with a London accent, encouraging others to join him

The video, entitled 'UK brothers in Syria' opens with a man in a camouflage jacket and balaclava sitting on an anti-aircraft gun, urging others to travel to Syria to fight.

'Dear brothers and sisters. This is a reminder just to show and tell people that jihad is still open, the doors of jihad are still open.

'By the grace of god, we have managed to bring in three or four beloved brothers of Islam. You can see for yourself,' he says in the video as the camera pans to another balaclava-ed man speaking in a British accent.

The man, wearing a black North Face jacket, sends his ‘greetings’ from Syria and makes references to warnings from British authorities, should citizens travel to Syria.

The man tells his ‘brothers’ to defy authorities and travel to Syria as there will be ‘consequences’ if they don’t.

Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a pro-Al Qaeda Jihadist group that many fear is taking an iron grip over parts of Syria.

The group was formed in April 2013 and grew out of Al Qaeda's affiliate organisation in Iraq, ISI.

Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) tried and failed to establish a Sunni state capital in the country, but held a strong presence in the most important battle grounds - including Baghdad and Salah ad Din - throughout the war.

The group lost strength but by 2012 was gathering momentum after moving into Syria, where it became ISIS.

It has since become one of the main Jihadist groups fighting government forces in Syria, and reports claim there are more than 2,500 ISIS members, mostly foreign fighters.

ISIS was formally disowned by the central organisation on February 3 for being too extreme.

One of its leaders, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has been deemed Middle East's most-wanted by the Iraqi interior ministry after a series of terrorist attacks which won him the moniker 'The Ghost'.

Widely considered the most radical group fighting President Bashar al-Assad, it is also engaged in a violent struggle with rival Islamist rebels.

ISIS controls much of rebel-held Syria in the north, including the town of Azaz, which was seized from the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) on 18 September.

The city of Raqqa, with a community of Christians, was the first provincial capital to be occupied by the group last year.
