These photographs of a Siberian ice cave set against the rising sun were snapped by a fearless photographer who risked his life on a frozen lake to capture the breathtaking images.

Andrey Grachev’s photos provide a rare glimpse inside the frozen grotto, but he had to travel across cracked ice that could give way at any moment.

Even though many adventurers have plunged through the ice in the past, the 35-year-old ignored the dangers to capture the cave in a beautiful golden sunlight.

When the 35-year-old entered the frozen cave he found large ice stalactites, or icicles, descending from its ceiling

Andrey, from Moscow, and local guides safely crossed Lake Baikal in Eastern Siberia, where around 50 cars are still waiting to be plucked from the frigid water after falling through the ice.

When he arrived at the magical cavern on Olkhon Island he found hundreds of icy stalactites and huge blocks of blue ice, known as ice hummocks.

Andrey said: ‘Dozens of accidents are registered every year. All of the accidents are from cars collapsing under the ice and of course there are casualties.

‘On the Maloe More Gulf, an area that is between the island and land, there are still more than 50 cars waiting to be lifted out of the water.

‘The danger comes from the ice's ability to move which results in some pretty wide cracks. Sometimes these ice hummocks can be longer than two metres wide.

Andrey said the sound of ice cracking underneath his feet was unnerving but he got used to it as it was a regular occurrence.

 Despite the dangers Andrey said the opportunity to photograph the spectacular ice cave was 'well worth the risk'

He added: ‘Most accidents happen when the ice is not thick enough, usually in December and January or when the drivers don't pay attention to the marked roads.

‘Luckily, we didn't experience any dangerous situations but on the way back we suddenly came across a huge crack on the road which forced us to find a new route.

‘Winter in Baikal is simply fantastic, I'd say that despite the dangers the experience was well worth the risk.’
