Famous 'Jackass' stuntman and bad boy Steve-O is facing a traffic citation for his latest stunt.

Stephen Gilchrist Glover, 40, or 'Steve-O,' posted a YouTube video of his latest prank. 

The video showed Steve-O climbing up a freeway sign in San Diego to attach a banner that read 'sucks' after the words 'SeaWorld' on the sign, Fox 5 reports.

The incident occured in May, but the prankster's identity remained unknown until Steve-O uploaded the YouTube video in August, according to the LA Times.

Steve-O was charged with  an infraction of California's vehicle code -- comparable to a speeding ticket. Officials say his stunt put 'drivers and their passengers in harm’s way,' Fox reports.

City officials said Caltrans could seek reimbursement because the vandalism damaged the sign. 

In September, California Highway Patrol made a statement saying they recommended charges of trespassing and vandalism to the district attorney's office, the Times reports.

But, the animal rights activist is being forced to pay a $239 fine or go to traffic court, according to Fox. 

Attempts: Steve-O's prank is carried out over a course of two days with several failed attempts 

First: During his first attempt, Steve-O has trouble climbing a rope and ends up strung upside down by his foot. 

In September, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals agreed to pay any fine assessed for the stunt, according to NBC.

'Steve-O isn't the only one who realizes that SeaWorld sucks,' Lisa Lange, PETA senior vice president, told the Times, 'and the highway sign needs to come down.'

When the CHP issued its request, Steve-O took to Instagram to voice his opinion.

He wrote: 'The California Highway Patrol has requested that the District Attorney file charges against me for helping out this sign. Bring on the publicity, because #SeaWorldSucks #yeahdude #freesteveo.' 

'SeaWorld': At the end of the video, Steve-O, who has posed for PETA public service campaigns, yells, 'If doing that was wrong, I don't want to be right. Screw you, SeaWorld'

At the beginning of the video, Steve-O says 'I'm putting my foot down for Shamu' before making the two-day attempt to climb the freeway sign and attach the 'sucks' banner. 

After a few failed attempts, Steve-O enlists the help of a few more men to help him complete his task. 

After another failed attempt, he buys a latter and is soon standing victoriously on the sign's platform with his fists in the air, having successfully attached the sign.

At the end of the video, Steve-O, who has posed for PETA public service campaigns, yells, 'If doing that was wrong, I don't want to be right. Screw you, SeaWorld.' 

The video has received more than a million views since its upload.
