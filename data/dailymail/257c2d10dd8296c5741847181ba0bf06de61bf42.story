After the heartbreak of seven miscarriages, Jenny Cash was overjoyed when she finally gave birth to a healthy girl.

She and her husband Nathan could at last could dare to dream of the  large family they’d always wanted.

But they had not banked on seeing their wish come true quite so quickly – after a second successful pregnancy produced triplets, with no IVF.

Nathan and Jenny Cash with 2-year-old daughter Alessia and the new triplets Ben, Jayden and Taylor who were born on August 6

Mr Cash, 35, an aircraft engineer, told of the moment the couple, who married in 2009, learned they would be having three more children.

He said: ‘Looking at the scan monitor in hospital we couldn’t believe our eyes.

‘There, plain to see, were three pairs of arms and legs, and three tiny heads. So we both sat there with our mouths open.’

Mrs Cash said: ‘It’s a bit ironic, really, after all the miscarriages, then to be having triplets. It seemed like someone was having a laugh upstairs.’

She added: ‘Nathan was like “I can’t afford four kids”, and I was like “How did this happen? How am I going to carry three?!”.’

Despite their repeated failure to have a child, the couple, from Bar Hill near Cambridge, never tried IVF as doctors could not find a medical reason for the miscarriages.

Triplets Taylor, Ben and Jayden were born at 33 weeks on August 6, and were taken home just 10 days later

Mrs Cash said: ‘We had tests, but they just said, “It’s just one of those things and if you can bear it just keep trying”.

‘We went to two different hospitals, but they couldn’t find anything, They said it was just bad luck, really.’

But she refused to give up. ‘I just thought, “Well, we’ll keep trying”.’

Then two years ago Mrs Cash’s eighth pregnancy gave the couple their first child, Alessia. And earlier this year the couple were astounded to learn that she was pregnant again – and carrying triplets.

Bursting with pride: Jenny Cash said on the day of the triplets' birth she was ready to 'get them out'. They arrived by caesarean section a minute apart from one another

On August 6, Mrs Cash, 35, gave birth to identical boys Ben and Jayden, and a girl, Taylor.

Delivered by Caesarean section at 33-and-a-half weeks – as is the norm for triplets – they weighed just over four-and-a-half pounds each.

Mrs Cash said: ‘On the day itself I was like, “Get them out! I’ve had enough now!”’

The babies each arrived a minute apart – first the boys, both at 4lbs 9oz, followed by Taylor at 4lbs 8oz.

Mrs Cash said: ‘They all came out crying; they were like a litter of kittens, with little tiny cries.’

The delivery at the Rosie Maternity Hospital in Cambridge was straightforward and despite being premature, the triplets were home in ten days.

The babies are thriving – but telling the boys apart is a challenge, so the proud parents have left Ben’s hospital tag on for now.

Mr Cash said: ‘We always wanted a big family. But just having two kids was proving difficult. But now we’ve got an instant larger brood.’

The couple have new challenges – they cannot fit four baby seats into their car and have to rely on the grandparents for a lift.

But Mrs Cash is relishing her new family. ‘It’s really nice. And I don’t ever need to be pregnant ever again. Imagine if it was another three? Blimey!’
