Crash: Kirsty Bowen, of Bath, Somerset, died last October behind the wheel of her Peugeot 205

A teenager who was mowed down by a drink driver as a child died on the night of her 18th birthday party - after crashing her car while three times over the limit, an inquest heard.

Kirsty Bowen, of Bath, Somerset, suffered a broken jaw and cheek aged nine after she was knocked down by a drunk motorist in 2004 – but she died last October behind the wheel of her Peugeot 205.

During the early hours of the morning after her 18th birthday party at home, the student left her house with two friends in her car to go and see her boyfriend, but her vehicle clipped a kerb.

The car was sent spinning into a parked vehicle before flipping over and landing on its roof. The two passengers were unhurt, but Kirsty suffered serious head injuries and died at the scene.

A post-mortem found 235mg of alcohol per 100ml - three times the legal drink-drive limit, 80.

Coroner Gail Elliman recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying: ‘Kirsty Bowen died when she lost control of her car. She was not wearing a seat belt and was significantly over the drink-driving limit.’

Kirsty, who had begun the second year of a health and social care course and wanted to be a midwife, spent the night celebrating her 18th two days after her birthday with a house party.

PC Mark Steadman from Avon and Somerset Police's collision investigation team told the inquest at Flax Bourton that her driving ability would have been affected by the alcohol.

Two of her friends suffered minor injuries in the 2am crash and were taken to hospital before being discharged.

In a tribute following her death her mother Sharon, 48, said Kirsty had overcome a lot after almost dying as a baby during childbirth.

Her mother also revealed Kirsty and being knocked down by a drink-driver in Bath when she was nine. Mrs Bowen said on the night of her death ‘happy, bubbly’ Kirsty had been driving to see her boyfriend Perry Stroud, 22.

She said: ‘It just hasn't sunk it. She 
was my soul-mate, she was my friend, she helped me through difficult 
times, she was my baby.’

Father Mark, 49, said: ‘She was always 
smiling, never sad. She would help anyone. If anyone was in need she 
would be there. She was a good girl - she had her ups and downs, but all
kids do.

‘She was the life and soul of the party. Every photo of her, she is smiling. She was the most happiest bubbliest person she just made everyone happy.’

Kirsty, who had two brothers, Gareth and Thomas, and a sister Lynette, had just started the second year of a course at the City of Bath College.

A statement from the college following the death said: ‘Our heartfelt sympathy and sincere condolences are with Kirsty's family at this distressing and difficult time.’
