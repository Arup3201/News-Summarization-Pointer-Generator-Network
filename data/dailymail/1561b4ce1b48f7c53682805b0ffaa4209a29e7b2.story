Watch Van Gaal deliver fascinating talk to businessmen as new Old Trafford boss boasts about his triumphs at Barcelona and Bayern

Louis van Gaal was keen to get down to business as he officially launched his reign at Manchester United on Wednesday.

The Dutchman donned a blue suit and tie for his first engagement, a photo shoot with assistant manager Ryan Giggs and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward.

Van Gaal then changed into a training top and shorts for his first meeting with the players who had not been on World Cup duty during the summer.

The man nicknamed the Iron Tulip was spotted striding purposefully across the training ground towards the players, including new £28m signing Ander Herrera.

But Van Gaal let Giggs give the first pep talk, maybe deciding he should wait for the return of his star names before setting out his blueprint for success.

The players were put through their paces with a series of conditioning drills and ball work at United's Carrington training complex.

Van Gaal
 has taken up the reins only four days after guiding Holland to third 
place at the World Cup in Brazil, eschewing a break himself.

And the 62-year-old, United's first manager from outside the British Isles, will have no time to ease himself in.

On Thursday he will be officially presented at a press conference at Old Trafford at 3pm before jetting off to the USA on Friday for the club's pre-season tour.

Good omen: Van Gaal has had a successful summer with Holland at the 2014 World Cup

United will play matches against the Los
 Angeles Galaxy, Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, while Van Gaal's Old
 Trafford debut will come in a friendly against Valencia on August 12.

Four days later United will open their Barclays Premier League campaign at home to Swansea.

A fast start will be a major priority for the new boss as United look to bounce back from last year's seventh-placed finish, which cost Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes his job.
