Jetting across the world without a care in the world except what Prada shoe to wear.

This is Dorothy Wang, the 26-year-old heiress to one of China's largest mall chains, worth $4 billion, and star of Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills.

In the future, she says, she wants to 'do it all' to follow her father into wealth and success - jewelry design, cooking, publishing, fashion.

But for now, she describes herself as 'funemployed' as she has a raucous time living luxuriously rather than toiling through job ads.

'Funemployed': Dorothy Wang, 26, scales the world - going to parties and appearing on Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills

Living the life: This is one of many private jet photos budding entrepreneur Wang has posted on her Instagram

Wang wrote: Sleeping on it #mirrorrollieselfie #ismyoldwatchstillsickertho #41mm #badbitchproblems

Packed up and ready to go: Dorothy wrote 'living the Rimowa life' in reference to the luggage design brand

And her Instagram feed that scales the globe, from LA to Shanghai, gives credence to her motto.

'How cute are these #richkid survival baskets?' she asks her followers, with a picture of expensive liquor and chocolate. 

'Who's ready to conquer the great outdoors???' she says, boarding a private jet.

Another picture shows her wearing two Rolex watches, with another golden one beside her, and the hash tag #badbitchproblems.

However, in an interview with Business Insider this week, Wang insists it is not all fun and games.

Landing a role on Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills was an attempt to prove that she can earn a living without her father's support, she explains.

She says she has been dogged by assumptions that Roger Wang, founder of Golden Eagle International Group, will make life easy for her and her sister. 

'It was important for me to do the show and get it on the air, on my own, and I didn't even tell my dad about it so no one could say anything like that,' she says.

'He didn't invest anything in it, he didn't even know about it. 

'And so that was important for me to have for myself as well to carve my own path, which is very different from my dad's. 

'But I can turn this into a business, just not in the traditional sense like my father's, but I think it can be just as successful in another way.'

In between holidays to Hawaii and shopping sprees in Las Vegas, Wang has developed a jewelry line, turning her catchphrases on Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills into necklaces.

Fans can buy silver and gold chains with the words: #rich, #fabuluxe or #nofilter - an Instagram phrase which means a picture is naturally impressive, without the use of photo editing. 

While she hopes the business venture takes off - with more collections planned, including a necklace with the phrase #funemployed on it - Wang continues to entertain her growing fan base with snap shots of her luxurious lifestyle. 

Many posts feature idyllic scenes as she asks people to guess which country or city she has traveled to.

The jet-setting posts come between numerous shots of designers bags, shoes, and dresses.

'Running errands with Vivs,' she says, with a picture of two Hermes purses worth around $100,000.

Another, with a picture of glistening silver-capped brogues, reads: 'Breaking in my new shoes #miumiu #ouchies'.

And during New York Fashion Week, Wang posted a shot of herself wearing two different colors of the same Prada strappy sandals: 'Silver or black @prada? #doubleshoeproblems'.

In another post she says: 'I love traveling and getting to stay at great hotels all over the world, but there's nothing like sleeping in your own bed after a long trip!!!'
