Guilty: Self-styled peer Hugh Rodley faces jail time after targeting 600 pensioners in a £6million investment scam

A self-styled peer dubbed the ‘Lord of Fraud’ who once planned the world’s biggest bank raid is facing years behind bars for a £6m investment scam.

Lord Hugh Rodley, 65, along with Julian Silver, 43, Adam Corbett, 31, and Sonny Willis, 28, fleeced up to 600 pensioners into backing companies with the promise of ‘rich rewards’.

The gang drew up ‘sucker lists’ of people they planned to exploit and splashed their criminal fortune on flash cars, including an Aston Martin, Range Rover S3 and a Lotus Elise.

He also lived in £2 million mansion in Gloucestershire and was chauffered around in a Rolls-Royce.

In 2010 Rodley was jailed for eight years for an extraordinary plot to steal £229m from a Japanese bank in one of the biggest ever cyber crimes of its kind.

The plan to plunder Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in 2004, failed at the last minute after the bungling computer boffins inputted the wrong codes.

Rodley, Silver, Corbett and Willis were found guilty by a jury of nine women and three men of running the scam between 2004 and 2007.

It is alleged the gang spent the money on luxury cars including a Lotus Elise, like the one pictured

Phillip Dennett, 41, was cleared of involvement in the fraud but found guilty of laundering the proceeds along with the others.

The men employed high pressure sales techniques and promised ‘rich rewards’ to trick members of the public to invest in firms they claimed were to be floated on the stock market.

They said the cash would be invested in ‘exotic’ and ‘fail-safe’ projects such as land development Europe and Asia, but none of the firms were ever floated.

Investors were cherry-picked using so-called ‘sucker lists’, detailing people who had already invested in some shares.

One 87-year-old man lost more than £800,000 to the fraudsters.

During the ten week long trial at Southwark Crown Court prosecutor Simon Farrell said the four men had been involved in the ‘dishonest extraction of several million pounds’ from investors.

He said they were told they would quickly make ‘handsome profits’ when the companies were floated on the Alternative Investment Market.

‘This type of trick involving the 
dishonest selling of worthless shares is colloquially known as a boiler 
room fraud,’ Mr Farrell said.

‘The term is used to describe high pressure sales techniques often targeting elderly and vulnerable victims.

‘A large number of victims in this case were subjected to high pressure sells and repeated calls until they agreed to invest.

Previous convictions: Lord Hugh Rodley was guilty of attempting to steal £229 million from the Sumitomo Matsui Banking Corporation and jailed for eight years

‘One 87-year-old gentleman, Mr Birch, unfortunately parted with £828,000 investing in most of the companies.

‘Many of the elderly victims are not fools by any stretch of the imagination; they are all successful, responsible individuals who eventually gave in to sales patter.’

Those who agreed to invest were almost always sent a contract setting out the amount of shares they agreed to, the price per share and a letter providing details of how their share made payment.

But most people gained little or no contact afterwards, said the barrister.

He added: ‘The companies appear to have done little if any real trading and none of the investors received any return at all.

‘Substantial amounts of money from victims were passed through bank accounts either controlled by or for the benefit of the defendants.

At the heart of the scam was a ‘floor book’ - a list of hundreds of investors, of whom 600 handed over cash to the fraudsters.

The document was seized after being discovered on Rodley’s computer when his property was searched following his arrest.

‘The book has in excess of 1000 names, 600 of which handed over money for investment.

‘They didn’t all hand over money, but hundreds did.

‘The floor book records around £6million worth of investment and marks as received a figure in the region of £3million.

‘But what the bank accounts show is what was actually received that can in fact be traced back to the floor book - around £2.7million.

‘The defendants used so-called sucker lists, detailing people with small shareholdings, and started phoning people up offering shares in exotic land development buildings in Europe and Asia and water desalination projects.’

Father-of-three Rodley had claimed he was not part of any plot to con investors telling jurors: ‘At no time was I involved in selling worthless share.

‘I did not participate in any boiler room fraud.

‘I did not act dishonestly.’

Rodley, who bought his manorial title at auction in 1986, said he believed Willis and Corbett were legitimate businessmen looking to help promote two of his companies, Mediatel and Eurowaste Recycling.

Rodley, of (Tudor Manor), Church End, Tewksbury, Gloucestershire, Willis, of (Orchard View) Glebe Road, Ramsden Bellhouse, Billericay, Essex, Silver, of (Little Plumpton House), Hinx Hill, Ashford, Kent, and Corbett, of (Apartment 71) Dorchester Court, London Road, Camberley, Surrey, were all convicted of conspiracy to defraud.

They are alleged to have committed the offence with Bernard Davies, who died having committed suicide in 2009.

They were accused of defrauding customers through companies including World Aqua Tech PLC, ART IT PLC, Mediatel PLC, BMHC PLC, European Land Development Agency PLC, and Eurowaste Recycling PLC, between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2007.

Rodley and Willis were also convicted of defrauding customers through Northface Trading Ltd, Datawave Systems Inc and Novopal Limited from January 1, 2005 to December 3, 2005, however Corbett was acquitted.Rodley and Silver were also convicted of fraudulent trading in relation to World Aqua Tech Limited between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006.

Silver and Dennett had both denied fraudulent trading in relation to ART IT Limited between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2007.

Dennett, of (24) Montgomery Close Great Sankey, Warrington, Cheshire, was cleared of conspiracy to defraud but convicted with the four others of converting and transferring the proceeds of the fraud between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006.
