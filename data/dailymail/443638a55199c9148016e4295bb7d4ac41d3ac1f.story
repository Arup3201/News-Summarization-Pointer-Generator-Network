Serious Champions League business begins for Chelsea in February after Jose Mourinho's men completed their unbeaten Group G campaign with a 3-1 win over Sporting Lisbon. Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham rated the players' performances at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea (4-2-3-1) 

Petr Cech 6

Not much he could do about it about Sporting's opener, buried in the bottom left corner, but pulled off a smart save to keep out Islam Slimani's back-post header with Chelsea 3-1 up.

Cesar Azpilicueta 6

Becoming Chelsea's ever-present, if he's not on the left-hand side in the league then he is deputising for Branislav Ivanovic on the right. Solid performance.

Kurt Zouma 6

Stood up to the test when Sporting were in attack and looked a strong force in the middle of their back four.

Andre Schurrle (centre) capped an impressive display with a goal against Sporting LIsbon

Gary Cahill 6

Calm and composed at the centre of Chelsea's defence, organising team-mates who seldom play alongside him this season.

Filipe Luis 6.5

Won the penalty which set Chelsea on their way early on in the game and looked like he was relishing a rare start under Jose Mourinho.

John Mikel Obi 6

Performed his duties well, protecting the back four and holding on to possession in awkward positions, and got on the scoresheet with his first ever Champions League goal.

Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah was involved in much of Chelsea's attacking play

Nemanja Matic 6.5

Almost scored a peach, side-footing a first-time effort narrowly over the top left corner from the edge of the box.

Andre Schurrle 7.5

Scored a wonderful effort, finishing off a move which started on Chelsea's left hand side by taking a touch before burying the ball into the bottom left corner from the edge of the box. Bright throughout.

Cesc Fabregas 7

Scored the penalty to put Chelsea in front and sent in a great ball in from a free kick to set up Mikel for a tap-in. Playing the No 10 role behind Diego Costa he was not in his usual deeper central midfield role, but played just as well.

Cesar Azpilicueta (left) is Chelsea's Mr Dependable and turned in another assured display

Mohamed Salah 6.5

Energetic on the left-hand side of the three attacking midfielders and much of Chelsea's forward play came down that side.

Diego Costa 6

Burly, bustling, good on the ball, a handful for Sporting's defenders. He was – and is – the archetypal striker that defenders do not want to play against.
