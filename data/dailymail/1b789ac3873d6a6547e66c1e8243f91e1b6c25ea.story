A robber who stole £650 from a betting shop was caught by police - after they recognised his giant chin on CCTV.

Ricky Loft, from Greenhithe, Kent, stormed into a William Hill bookies armed with an 'imitation gun', which was wrapped in a black bin liner.

The 32-year-old thug pointed the weapon at staff and ordered a worker to fill a bag with cash.

'Prominent chin': Ricky Loft, 32, who raided a William Hill betting shop, was caught on CCTV camera after police recognised his prominent chin from a previous police mugshot

Loft, who was wearing a hood covering the top half of his face, then escaped from the shop on Whitstable high street.

Staff from the betting shop reported the raid, which took place on November 21 last year, but could only describe the bottom half of the robber's face.

But the breakthrough came when police examined CCTV footage from the betting shop - and spotted the raider had a 'prominent chin'.

A mugshot of Loft, who was known to police before that incident, was already on police file.

When police compared the mugshot to the CCTV stills, they noticed both men had a jutting chin - and that it must be the same man.

A police 
insider said: 'The key piece of evidence which nailed him was his prominent chin.

'Local
 officers recognised him immediately when thy were shown CCTV by 
detectives. When they compared his facial features with a mugshot, he 
was bang to rights.'

Loft was arrested at his home six days after the raid.

At Maidstone Crown Court, Loft was jailed for six years after pleading guilty to the robbery and possession of an imitation firearm.

It is not known exactly what sort of imitation firearm Loft was carrying.

A spokesman for Kent Police confirmed that local officers 'instantly recognised' Loft from the CCTV footage.

He said: 'Through the use of CCTV footage detectives soon realised Loft was responsible for the armed robbery and he was arrested in London on 27 November.'

Detective Sergeant Matt Scott, of the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate, said: 'On the evening of 21 November 2013, Ricky Loft was intent on making some money by whatever means he could think of.

'The flagrant disregard Loft has for public safety and the law means he is now where he belongs - in prison.'
