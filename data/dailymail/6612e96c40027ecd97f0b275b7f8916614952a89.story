Jamaican sprinters Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson have had their doping bans reduced from 18 months to six months and are free to compete immediately, the Court of Arbitration for Sport has announced.

Powell will make an immediate return by competing on Tuesday in the men's 100 metres at Lucerne in Switzerland.

The pair were suspended by a Jamaica Anti-doping disciplinary panel after testing positive for the banned stimulant oxilofrine.

Boost: Asafa Powell has been given the go-ahead to return to action after having a ban reduced

They 
appealed to CAS to have their bans reduced to three months and the 
appeals were partially upheld. As the six-month bans have already been 
served, they are now eligible to compete.

Powell wrote on Twitter: 'Finally this weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Justice has been served. Now let's run!'

A statement on CAS' website read: 'CAS has upheld in part the appeals filed by the Jamaican sprinters Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson against the decisions of the Jamaica Anti-doping disciplinary panel imposing a suspension of 18 months on both of them, starting on 21 June 2013.

'The CAS decided to reduce their period of ineligibility to 6 months, which has been already served. The athletes were already free to compete since 18 June 2014 after the CAS had granted a stay of the decisions of the Jamaica Anti-doping Disciplinary Panel of 8 and 10 April 2014.

Reason to smile: Sherone Simpson is free to compete again after the Court of Arbitration ruling

'Both athletes filed appeals at CAS 
against their 18-month suspension. They put forward that the offense 
committed was minor because it was caused by contamination of the food 
supplement "Epiphany D1" by the banned substance Oxilofrine and 
requested that the suspensions be reduced to 3 months. They were heard 
at a hearing which took place on 7 and 8 July 2014 in New York.'

Powell immediately expressed his relief on Twitter saying: 'Thank u to The Court of Arbitration for Sport. Finally this weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Justice has been served. Now let's run!'

The 31-year-old then added he would make an instant return to the track in Lucerne tomorrow.

The reduction of the ban - given after he tested positive at the Jamaican national championships last summer - means he can return ahead of his scheduled date of December.

Powell, who held the 100 metres world record between 2005 and 2008, had initially expressed his unhappiness at the ban, saying in April: 'This ruling is not only unfair, it is patently unjust.

'Panels such as these, I understood, were
 assembled to allow athletes who consciously or unconsciously come into 
conflict with the rules of sport a chance at equitable redemption. 
Unfortunately, this was not the case.'

Powell claimed that he took a legal supplement, Ephiphany D1, which was contaminated with oxilofrine.

He added: 'I want to reiterate that I have never knowingly taken any banned substances. I did all the necessary checks before taking Ephiphany D1 and it is my hope that the CAS will prove to be a more open and fair avenue for the review of all the facts in my case - facts and truth that were not taken into consideration at my initial hearing.'

His wish has now been granted but, like Simpson, he will miss next week's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with the Jamaican squad having already been selected during their suspension.

Like Powell, Simpson tested positive in last summer's Championships and blamed the positive result on a supplement given to her by a training partner. She had initially been suspended until December 20.
