The British-born prime minister of Australia has been accused of disrespect over her failure to curtsey to the Queen.

Julia Gillard, who is in favour of Australia becoming a republic, said curtseying is ‘just not me’.

Instead she shook the Queen’s hand when the monarch arrived in Canberra at the start of a demanding ten-day tour. She also drew criticism for not wearing a hat.

Show of respect: Governor General Bryce curtseyed to both the Queen and Prince Philip at a later meeting

By contrast Australia’s governor  
general, Quentin Bryce – who was born in Brisbane – curtseyed to both 
the Queen and Prince Philip.

Miss Gillard, 50, was born in Wales and moved to Australia with her parents when she was four.

Asked on Melbourne radio whether she 
believed curtseying was demeaning, she said: ‘Some things are you, some 
things aren’t. I made a choice and I thought I would feel most 
comfortable with bowing my head. The advice was to do what comes most 
comfortably and naturally.’

Miss Gillard is far from being the first public figure to have breached protocol with respect to the Queen.

A rule concerning the sovereign has been set in stone for generations.
'Whatever you do, don't touch the Queen,' courtiers are apt to warn.

But during
a G20 reception at Buckingham Palace in 2009, Michelle Obama put her 
hand around the Queen for about 10 seconds

Finding 
herself next to Mrs Obama, the Queen had remarked on their height 
difference. As she did so, her hand edged towards the small of Mrs 
Obama's back. Mrs Obama responded - and even rubbed the Queen's shoulder
- before both women moved gently apart.

The Lizard of Oz: Paul Keating touched the Queen in 1992

In May, during the Queen's first official visit to the Republic of Ireland, Irish president Mary McAleese, like Miss Gillard, greeted the Queen with a simple handshake.

Miss Gillard, however, is not even the first  Australian prime minister to have breached royal protocol.

In
1992 Paul Keating was given the nickname of 'Lizard of Oz' after he 
touched the Queen's lower back with his arm as he guided her through a 
crowd of people.

In 2000 another Australian premier, John Howard, denied touching the monarch as he introduced her to MPs at a VIP reception.

Faux pas: Don Romero broke royal protocol in 2010 by putting his hand on the Queen's back

Last
year, while visiting Canada, racehorse owner Don Romeo put his hand on 
her back as she handed a trophy to the owner of the winning horse at the
Queen's Plate Stakes in Toronto.

His 
breach of protocol was swiftly corrected, however, when his 
Jockey, Eurico Da Silva, executed two bows so low that his head was 
level with the Queen's  waist.

So how should one behave?

There 
are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting the Queen or members 
of the Royal Family, but many people wish to observe tradition.

For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women execute a small 
curtsey.

For those who prefer, it is in fact perfectly acceptable simply to shake hands.

On presentation to the Queen, the correct formal address is 'Your Majesty' and subsequently 'Ma'am'. For male royals the same rules apply, with the 
title used in the first instance being 'Your Royal Highness' and 
subsequently 'Sir'.

For other female members of the Royal Family the first address is 
conventionally 'Your Royal Highness' followed by 'Ma'am'.

Julia Gillard, the leader of the Australian Labor government, was born in Wales and moved to Australia with her parents when she was six.

Last year Miss Gillard, pictured, indicated that when the Queen dies, her party should start the process of making the country a republic.

Despite public opinion being divided over the question of severing all ties with the monarch, she said the Queen should be the country's final monarch.

Miss Gillard, 50, said: 'What I would like to see as prime minister is that we work our way through to an agreement on a model for the republic. I think the appropriate time for this nation to move to be a republic is when we see the monarch change.'

The issue is a contentious one for Australians, many of whom are British immigrants or descendants who still feel strong loyalty to Britain and the Queen.

Australia is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies. As head of state in Australia, the British monarch serves a largely symbolic and ceremonial function, and is represented by the governor-general.

In a referendum in 1999 the idea of a republic was rejected by 54 per cent of the population.

The royal website, which gives 
official advice on how to behave when meeting the Queen, states that 
there are ‘no obligatory codes of behaviour – just courtesy’.

It does say that many people wish to 
observe the traditional forms of greeting and suggests curtseying for 
women and bowing for men as appropriate.

Republicans have pointed out that 
other prominent women have also decided that a handshake is more 
appropriate. Cherie Blair declined to curtsey to the Queen and wore 
trousers on a visit to Balmoral in 1997.

William Hanson, a British etiquette 
and protocol expert, told Sydney’s 3AW radio that Miss Gillard should 
have curtseyed  and worn a hat.

‘She is your prime minister, she is  
representing the people, but the Queen  tops her, so as a sign of 
respect, whatever  her opinion on the monarchy is, she should have 
curtseyed.

‘Whatever you believe about the 
monarchy, if you don’t curtsey, you don’t bow, it’s not going to bring 
down the monarchy. You’re not making some grand gesture that’s going to 
shake it to its core. It’s just a bit churlish not to do it.’

Matthew Archer, deputy chairman of the
Victoria branch of the Australian Monarchist League, described Miss 
Gillard’s choice of a handshake as ‘rude and impolite’.

As the controversy took over social  
websites, prominent Australian TV host  Lisa Wilkinson tweeted: ‘Small 
thing: saw GG [governor general] curtsey to Queen  but not the PM. 
Anyone know background to that?’

But Miss Gillard insisted she had done
nothing wrong, pointing out that she was an admirer of the Queen and 
believed many Australians held her with a great deal of affection and 
respect – ‘and so do I’.

She added: ‘I mean, what a life, what 
an incredible life she’s lived over so many generations of change and to
see someone play such a steadfast role over so much change, I think, is
remarkable.’
