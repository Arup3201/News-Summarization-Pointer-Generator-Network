Novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford, pictured with husband Bob, says the secret to happy marriage is to respect your partner

She has been happily married for almost half a century.

And Barbara Taylor Bradford has given a very simple piece of advice for all those women searching for the answer to marital bliss; admire your husband.

The best-selling author, who wed film producer Bob Bradford on Christmas Eve in 1963 after meeting on a blind date, said respecting one’s partner was the most important ingredient of a happy marriage.

The 79-year-old, who famously wrote a 
guide called How to be the Perfect Wife, said she was appalled by 
couples who quarrel in public.

She
said: ‘I think that basically, you can’t just be in love with a man. I 
think you have got to admire him and like him. Because a lot of the 
other stuff goes away.

‘That
doesn’t have to matter – but I feel that you have to work at marriage. 
You have to like and respect the man you are married to.

‘There’s
nothing worse than when we go out to dinner with a couple, and the 
woman starts to put her husband down and vice versa. It’s unnecessary. 
If you don’t like each other, then get a divorce. We remain married 
because of those reasons and because we share very simple interests.’

Speaking
to the Daily Mail at the launch of her latest novel, Secrets from the 
Past, hosted by The Lady magazine she added: ‘We like going to the cinema, going to the theatre and 
reading. The only thing we don’t do together is sit in the sun – because
Bob likes to lie by the pool in the South of France and bake himself, 
whereas I go the colour of a lobster.

Barbara Taylor Bradford has dedicated each of 29 novels to her husband Bob

‘That’s the only thing we don’t agree 
on, but I never chide him about it. I’ve learned to keep quiet. You’ve 
got to edit yourself sometimes.

‘It’s knowing when to shut up, because men never do. It’s always women who think, “I’ll walk away from an argument”.’

Miss
Taylor Bradford is regarded as the doyenne of women’s fiction whose 27 
novels, including the hugely popular A Woman Of Substance, have sold 88 
million copies worldwide.

She
and her husband, a former German Jewish refugee, met in London in 1961 
after being introduced by a mutual friend who took them on a blind date.

At the time, she was 28 and was working as a writer for the London American Magazine, while he was already an established film producer, having worked on the Charlton Heston epic El Cid.

She said he had immediately made an impression on her because he was wearing a tie.

Two years later the couple got married and moved to America, where she began writing novels.

She published her most famous book, A Woman of Substance in 1979, which went on to sell 31million copies worldwide. She has earned a fortune of £188m, selling 88million books globally during her career.

She has dedicated each of her 29 novels to her husband, who she has described as ‘demanding’, while he has made 10 of her books into films whilst managing her career.

The couple have never had children and Miss Taylor Bradford has spoken in the past of suffering a miscarriage during the 1960s. She said she suspects that she also had a second miscarriage, but says it was too early in the pregnancy to be certain.

In the past the writer has claimed that they’ve never had a major row, saying: ‘We’ve never said anything like, “You’re a son of a bitch.” We always stay on the subject of the quarrel rather than attack each other.

‘I may get shrill with Bob, but I don’t say wounding things to him. That is against the rules.’
