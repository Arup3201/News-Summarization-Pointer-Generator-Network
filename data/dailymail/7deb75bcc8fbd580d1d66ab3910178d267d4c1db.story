This is the tournament that will see Lionel Messi, at the age of 27, at his peak. 

Argentina have traditionally felt more comfortable when the tournament is played on their continent. They aim to win it. In their biggest rivals’ backyard. For Messi, this is his World Cup.

The team revolves around Messi, although with team-mates in attack such as Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain and Angel di Maria, Argentina are the Real Madrid of national teams: they enjoy playing on the break, with pace.

Now or never: This summer's World Cup is the tournament which will see Lionel Messi at his peak

Absolutely everything has been done to ensure Argentina, and Messi, arrive as serious contenders, including the appointment of a new coach.

Despite a 4–1 win against Spain in September 2010, then manager Sergio Batista failed to combine the footballing growth of ‘The Flea’ with a team that worked. He failed in the Copa America held in Argentina in 2011,  losing to Uruguay in the quarter-finals.

Alejandro Sabella came in and lifted spirits without making too much noise. The four forwards (Messi, Di Maria, Aguero and Higuain) had been developing an understanding and would be sure starters. And in midfield, a combination of Javier Mascherano’s tactical discipline and Fernando Gago’s touch made them leaders on and off the pitch.

In 571 minutes of World Cup football Lionel Messi has scored just one goal.

Messi had Gago behind him and Aguero as his partner up front in both his titles with Argentina (Under 20 World Cup and the Olympic Games). They were reunited under Sabella.

Messi, alongside team-mates who were on the same wavelength, began playing with  freedom. He started becoming Barcelona’s Messi.

‘The only thing I said as soon as I joined the national team was that he had to be left in peace,’ says Sabella. ‘He once missed a penalty and it was as if an asteroid had struck the Earth. Please! 

‘Then they started, “What if he’s depressed...what’s happening to Messi?” It turns out that he scored five goals in the  following two matches. We have to understand that Messi is a human being.’

Sabella heeded advice from Pep Guardiola, the former Barcelona coach: ‘Protect him with players who make his job simpler.’ And make him feel loved, he added. With that in mind, the new coach gave Messi the captaincy.

Former captain Mascherano says: ‘I was the one who gave it to him. I told him I would no longer be captain. I told Messi he had to be captain because of everything he represented for us.

‘He was saying, “No! How? You are the captain!” and I was saying to him, “No, Leo, it has to be you”.’

Captaincy suited Messi. That is if you ignore his early team talks. Barcelona’s Gerard Pique recalls: ‘He told me that in Argentina they have a tradition of captains giving speeches before each match. When it was his turn, he said, “There is no speech today. Come on, let’s get on the pitch!” In his first match as captain!’

But, according to Manchester City’s Pablo Zabaleta, Messi gradually adapted to the responsibilities. ‘At the beginning he would speak to us on a more individual basis,’ says Zabaleta, ‘but now he says, “This is Argentina, let’s go for it from the start, remember the importance to the country”.’

Every king needs a coronation and Messi’s came on a very hot day in Barranquilla, Colombia. Argentina had already lost to Venezuela and drawn with Bolivia in their World Cup qualifiers. Then Colombia scored. 

‘That match, when we came back with a spectacular second-half performance by Lionel, was key,’ remembers Argentine writer Eduardo Sacheri. ‘He made us win. It was epic: a Messi who can give no more, dying from the heat, on the brink of exhaustion...and he turned it around. We love those stories.’

At that moment Argentine society became reconciled with Leo. His performances under Sabella (20 goals in 22 games, when under previous coaches he had scored 17 in 61) matched those of the team. Messi,  Di Maria, Higuain and Aguero scored 90 per cent of  Argentina’s goals in qualifying.

The idea of not winning in Brazil does not enter Messi’s head. It eats away at him that, although he feels he is No 1, he has not yet made history.

‘If we come back after the quarter-finals they will lambast him again,’ reflects Sacheri. 

‘If he wins, maybe Diego (Maradona) will move aside. Or we put both on the altar, father and son. The advantage of Christianity is we can love more than one divine personality.’

Now that Messi has got used to being Messi, his goal is to win the World Cup. As if it were written in the stars.
