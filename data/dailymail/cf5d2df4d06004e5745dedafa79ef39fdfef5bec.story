A ONE-OFF TRIUMPH

Swansea may be the former holders of the Capital One Cup but this competition in all its guises has actually been pretty unkind to the Welsh club over the years. Only once in their entire history have Swansea actually got beyond the fourth round and that was last year. Liverpool, meanwhile, had scored in all but two of their last 50 League Cup ties.

TIME TO PROVE THEIR WORTH

Brendan Rodgers’ ability to nurture and develop young talent is not in doubt as the progress witnessed from players like Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge illustrates. However, his judgement in the transfer market remains open to question. Forget the likes of Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert for a moment and consider that Lazar Markovic and Fabio Borini - both starters on Tuesday night - cost just over £30m between them.

GOOD TO BE HOME?

The last time Jonjo Shelvey played here for Swansea last season he scored a remarkable goal from about 30 yards. The former Liverpool midfielder did his best not to celebrate but he could have been forgiven a look towards the Main Stand in the direction of a bloke in front of the press box who spent the two years previous likening him to ‘Bambi on Ice..without any skates on’.

A FUSS ABOUT NOTHING

There was excitement in the world of social media last night when reports emerged of another Mario Balotelli bust-up. However suggestions that the errant Liverpool striker had been ordered off the pitch for not warming up properly proved to be errant. Balotelli actually had a twinge in his knee.
