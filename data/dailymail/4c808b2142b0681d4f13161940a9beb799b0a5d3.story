Danger zone: Chiwetel Ejiofor came close to whipping a fellow actor for real during the filming of 12 Years A Slave

Chiwetel Ejiofor remembered that for such a dark moment it was a very hot, beautiful day ‘and blue sky as far as the eye could see’.

The award-winning actor was in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, where he had to act in a scene for Steve McQueen’s masterpiece, 12 Years A Slave. 

Chiwetel portrays the real-life Solomon Northup, a freeman who was abducted and sold into slavery. All of a sudden, every-thing he’d held dear — his wife, his children, his name and his  freedom — were stripped from him. He was someone else’s property.

The scene I’m referring to involves Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps — a cruel, Bible-quoting plantation owner — Chiwetel’s Solomon and Patsey (played by Lupita Nyong’o), known as the Cotton Queen for her high cotton-picking yields, who is forced to satisfy ‘the predilections and peculiarities’ of Epps at any time of the day and night.

In this particular scene, Epps wants Patsey flayed alive — and demands Solomon does it. 

‘When Solomon describes the beating of Patsey in his book, he feels that nowhere else in the world was there a darker moment happening,’ Chiwetel told me.

We were talking in London on Monday about the making of the film, which has received seven Golden Globe nominations and is expected to haul in many more when Bafta and Oscar categories are revealed next month.

‘I remember I rode in with Lupito that day. It was early and we had a conversation about it,’ he said.

During shooting, a stunt man monitored the whipping and marked an area that Chiwetel and Fassbender could not cross.

‘It was very technical. If you stepped across the mark, you would be in the danger zone and Lupita would have been lashed for real.

‘Of course, we never got that  close. We just did the best we could to recreate the dark moment.’

When Solomon is abducted, Chiwetel, too, was beaten — whacked with a wooden paddle until it splintered for real. ‘There was no way of avoiding that. You couldn’t tell the story without showing what the psychological humiliation was,’ he said.

Yet, strangely, in a way the film is a love story. The yearning and longing Solomon has for his family is raw.

‘It’s about how powerful the connection we have to our family and the ones we love, and how when that’s disrupted it creates a whole other kind of fire,’ Chiwetel told me.

‘Solomon doesn’t want to survive — he wants to live. 

‘It’s that belief that he will see his loved ones again that helps him. It’s also part of what puts him in danger of losing his  mind.’

That the actor can convey such a complex set of emotions without going over the top marks his  performance as the best of  his career so far in the  hottest picture of this year — and probably the next one, too.

It opens here on January 10. Don’t miss it.

Rising star: Alicia Vikander, the fast-rising Swedish-born actress, will portray World War I writer and pacifist Vera Brittain in a film based on her seminal memoir A Testament Of Youth

Alicia Vikander, the fast-rising Swedish-born actress, will portray World War I writer and pacifist Vera Brittain in a film based on her seminal memoir A Testament Of Youth.

It is about the generation — including Brittain’s brother, fiancé and other close friends — who lost their lives during the Great War.

The movie — which is being produced by David Heyman and BBC Films — will go before cameras in the spring to be ready for a Remembrance Sunday release next year, which also marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the war.

Brittain’s book also chronicles her own battles with her father over her determination to go to university, as her brother had.

By 1915, she felt compelled to do what she could to help the war effort, so Brittain (the mother of Liberal Democrat politician Shirley Williams), joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment to tend those who had been wounded at the front.

But more than anything, it’s a heart-breaking story of the once-gilded youth hurled into what war poet Wilfred Owen called the ‘scorching cautery’ of war.

By the time of the Armistice in 1918, Brittain had lost her brother, Edward, her fiancé, Roland Leighton, and close family friends Geoffrey Thurlow and Victor Richards.

Brittain’s memoir, published in 1933, became an instant classic, but during World War II its pacifist sensibility was frowned upon.

However, the BBC produced an acclaimed five-part drama which pushed the book onto the  bestseller list.

Reading it again now, it makes you demand to know why our fighting men were sent to Iraq and Afghanistan.

Ms Vikander has just finished work on Guy Ritchie’s The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and Alex Garland’s mad scientist drama Ex Machina.

After she completes Testament Of Youth for director James Kent (his TV drama The Thirteenth Tale with Vanessa Redgrave and Olivia Colman is being shown on BBC2 on New Year’s Eve), she will move onto the long-awaited movie Tulip Fever, with Justin Chadwick (who made the Mandela movie) as director.

Dane DeHaan will be her leading man in Tulip Fever, while Christoph Waltz and Bill Nighy are being discussed for the other main male role, though it depends on dates as to which one will do it.

Talking of dates, it had been hoped that Saoirse Ronan, star of Hanna, would portray Vera Brittain. But she is due to start another movie, Brooklyn, at the same time Testament Of Youth will be shooting.

Refreshing: Oscar Isaac plays a musician who is an anti-star in the new Coen Brothers movie Inside Llewyn Davis

Oscar Isaac (right) plays a musician who’s an anti-star in the new Coen Brothers movie.

‘He’s very working-class, he’s happy doing his own thing, he doesn’t want fame and he’s not manicured or manufactured,’ Oscar said of the title role he plays in Inside Llewyn Davis, the luminous new movie by Joel and Ethan Coen, which opens here on January 24.

That’s probably one of the reasons I love the movie so much, because Llewyn Davis disdains the very idea of marketing himself. He just wants to play his guitar, sing and get into trouble.

‘It’s so refreshing, about someone who refuses to be socially and commercially manufactured,’ Oscar told me.

The film is set in the Sixties when there was a converging of traditional American music with the sounds coming out of the beat generation. Anyone for Dylan? Well, Llewyn Davis, who has nowhere to live and is a shambles, is the anti-Dylan. ‘He’s a rebellious artist. He’s a miserable f***,’ Oscar said.Yet he’s fascinating. I’ve seen the film three times in six months and never tire of it.

Carey Mulligan is Jean, a singer married to a fellow performer played by Justin Timberlake — but Llewyn Davis has cuckolded Timberlake’s character. At one  point, Jean snarls at Llewyn: ‘Everything you touch turns to s***. You’re like King Midas’s idiot brother’.

It’s a put-down that sticks.

During the first week of filming, all the cast waited for the Coen brothers’ approval after each take. ‘We’re used to having our egos stroked,’ Oscar said.

When it wasn’t forthcoming, some thought they were going to be fired, but later realised the Coens don’t waste precious time massaging egos.

So, in case no one told him: Oscar, your performance is sensational.
