Changed: Ms Moran's appearance had changed dramatically since the 2010 election when she appeared at a court hearing in September 2011

The MP who fiddled the largest sum on her expenses will keep more than £25,000 of a ‘golden handshake’ that other fraudsters were denied.

Margaret Moran, 57, cheated taxpayers out of £53,000 by forging invoices and claiming for bogus repairs to her second homes.

She was spared jail after a judge agreed she was mentally unfit to stand trial.

Instead, Moran received a two-year supervision and treatment order.

Now the Commons sleaze watchdog has closed the book on two investigations without taking disciplinary action.

The
former Labour MP repaid £6,000 but the authorities will struggle to 
claw back any money as she has not been found guilty of any crime.

Now it can be revealed Moran was paid as much as £26,852 in a ‘resettlement grant’ given to MPs when they leave Parliament.

It can also be disclosed she still has a property portfolio worth an estimated £1 million.

A
note published by the Committee on Standards and Privileges said: ‘It 
is not feasible to seek to take further disciplinary action against Ms 
Margaret Moran.’

Moran claimed £60,000 expenses between 2004 and 2008 as she ‘flipped’ the location of her second home between Westminster, her Luton constituency and a third house in Southampton.
