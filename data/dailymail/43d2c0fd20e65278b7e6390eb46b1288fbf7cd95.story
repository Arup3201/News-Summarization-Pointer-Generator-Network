From a distance it may look like a UFO is preparing to land.

But rather than being a scene from a Hollywood sci-fi film, these images capture the moment thousands of starlings flocked together into the shape of a spaceship.

Nature photographer Damian Waters caught the extraordinary spectacle, as he watched the birds swarm to seek the warmth of nearby cattle sheds.

Swarming to seek shelter in a nearby cattle shed, thousands of starlings gathered together in the skies over Rigg near Gretna in Scotland, to form the shape of a spaceship

Nature photographer Damian Waters travelled to Scotland with the hope of capturing the phenomena. He watched as the birds soared above his head creating stunning images in the winter sky at dusk

As they soared above the 44-year-old's head, they created an array of shapes in the winter sky at dusk in the skies over Rigg, near Gretna in Scotland.

Mr Waters travelled 110 miles from his home in the Wirral, Merseyside, to photograph the phenomenon of the starlings flocking together.

The persistent snapper waited for nearly two hours until the first of the birds appeared.

He said: 'At first there were just small groups of starlings in the fields, before they started to come in squadrons of 40 or 50, flying all over.

'Then suddenly, before I knew it, there were thousands all amalgamating together and they had formed the shape of a UFO.

'It was spectacular to watch.'

The images show the birds taking flight, filling the sky as though it was thick with smoke during the last few hours of sunlight.

Another shot reveals the swarm of birds gliding together to mimic the shape of a dolphin.

Mr Waters said: 'Starlings have a bit of a bad reputation. People see them in their gardens and think they are raucous and ugly, or that they bully other birds. But when you see them like that, it's one of nature's greatest spectacles'

Some fly ahead to form the head and nose, while those in pursuit funnel together to capture the shape of the mammal's fin and tail.

But Mr Waters said he had just minutes to secure the stunning shots, before the sun disappeared beyond the horizon and the starlings fled, seeking shelter for the night.

He said: 'I'd been waiting for a couple of hours before they arrived, and I was starting to think I wasn't going to have any luck.

'I was aware it was getting darker and when it started to rain I thought: "Well, that's the end of that, then".

'Luckily it was only a shower though, and the birds turned up at around 4pm.

'But after about 10 minutes, as quickly as they arrive, they are gone.

'You have be to there at exactly the right time - if I'd got there at 4.15pm, I'd have missed it all.

Mr Water added: 'I have never seen anything as big as that.

'It must be one of the biggest flocks in the country.

'Starlings have a bit of a bad reputation, though.

'People see them in their gardens and think they are raucous and ugly, or that they bully other birds.

'But when you see them like that, it's one of nature's greatest spectacles.'
