For most women, shifting post-baby weight can be a challenge, but for one mum-of-three, pregnancy turned out to be the most effective diet she could have hoped for.

Maggie Groome, 35, went from 20st down to 10st after violent morning sickness during her three pregnancies made her lose weight.

The mum-of-three from Cricklewood in Northwest London suffered from hyperemesis, a severe form of morning sickness which caused constant nausea and vomiting.

And she's not the only one: the Duchess of Cambridge was famously diagnosed with hyperemesis while she was pregnant with Prince George.

Despite the deeply unpleasant symptoms, Maggie feels lucky to have gained not only three beautiful children but also her dream body.

The supermarket assistant said, 'I'd always been a bigger girl, even from my school days.'

'By the time we started trying for children when I was in my mid-20s I was nearly 20st and was worried my weight would make it harder for me to conceive,' she continued.

'So when I found out I'd fallen pregnant I was over the moon - but I wasn't looking forward to putting on even more weight!

'As it turned out, I experienced the exact opposite. The morning sickness was so bad that I actually lost weight.'

'I wouldn't wish hyperemesis on anyone but looking back now I can say it came with surprising benefits,' she added.

Maggie and her fiance Chet Masters, 31, discovered she was pregnant in 2003. She said: 'I assumed the morning sickness would ease after a couple of months, but it never went away.

'I suffered constant waves of nausea and I couldn't keep down anything I ate.'

Increasingly concerned, Maggie attended an appointment with her GP, who diagnosed hyperemesis.

Hyperemesis gravidarum, which affects up to one in 50 pregnant women, is characterised by vomiting, nausea and dehydration.

Maggie was given anti-sickness medication, but the symptoms only got worse as her pregnancy progressed.

She said: 'There wasn't much the doctor could do about it. I just had to soldier on in the hope the sickness would go away, but it carried on even until the late stage of pregnancy.'

Maggie's son Taylor was born in May 2004 weighing 5lbs 13oz. After arriving home from hospital, she was amazed to discover that far from gaining weight, she'd actually lost three stone.

She said: 'I was stunned. Over the years I'd tried every fad diet going, but nothing had worked. It was amazing to think that, of all things, having a baby had shifted the pounds.'

In October 2013 she discovered she was pregnant for a second time. Once again, the morning sickness returned - and she lost even more weight.

She said: 'I'd prayed that the sickness wouldn't come back but it did with a vengeance. I was completely miserable

'It was almost unbearable and I couldn't face eating the tiniest portion, even though I was desperate to ensure my unborn child had all the nutrients it needed.

'There was some concern the baby wasn't getting enough food, so I was relieved when my daughter finally arrived.'

Lanesra was born in July 2008 weighing 5lb 2oz. She then discovered that over the course of the pregnancy she had lost a remarkable four stone.

When Maggie fell pregnant for the third and final time, she was prepared for the return of the hyperemesis, but this time the aftermath of the birth was more problematic.

Her son Darian was born underweight in February 2010 at 4lb 12oz. He was also severely jaundiced, requiring a six-week stay in intensive care.

Maggie, who this time lost 3st 7lb, developed serious gastroparesis, a condition which stops the movement of food from the the stomach to the small intestine.

Her weight fell to a skeletal 6st 11lbs in just three months as doctors battled to keep her hydrated through a drip.

She said: 'The weight kept falling away and I was exhausted. I'd just been through another rough pregnancy and I now had three little ones to look after. I was completely overwhelmed.

'After I recovered I decided that I didn't want any more children. I wasn't sure my body could sustain a fourth pregnancy.

'I'd been through hell with the hyperemesis but I was so grateful for what it had given me - not only three beautiful children, but a body I was proud of.'

Maggie said her pregnancies not only gave her three wonderful children but also the perfect body

Once recovered from the gastroparesis Maggie put on just over three stone and now weighs a healthy 10st - 9st 9lb less than before her pregnancies. She's also able to wear size 12 clothing.

She said: 'I was sick so much during my three pregnancies that I'm worried I've damaged my teeth.

'Every day felt like a challenge and I wouldn't go through that again for anything.

'But having survived, I feel strangely grateful. I'm now fitter and happier than I was when I was overweight. I'm not a skinny girl - and I don't want to be - but I'm much more careful about what I eat and I feel much healthier.

'The fact is that pregnancy was the best diet I've ever been on.'
