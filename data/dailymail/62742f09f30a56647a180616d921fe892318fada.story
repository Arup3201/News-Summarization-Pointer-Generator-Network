Move over, Nigella. On your bike, Delia. A gastronomically gifted Italian has officially been named the world's best female chef.

Nadia Santini, who was taught to cook by her nonna-in-law, is head chef of the Michelin-starred Dal 
Pescatore restaurant in a small village in northern Italy, and was today honoured with the Best 
Female Chef gong at the World's 50 Best Restaurants awards.

Dal Pascatore, which was founded in 1925 by Santini's husband's family, is situated in Runate, between Mantova and Cremona, and their menu changes seasonally but always includes signature dishes such as pumpkin parcels, tiny meat ravioli in broth, herb omelette, chargrilled eel and tortellini stuffed with pumpkin, amaretto, Parmesan, and mostarda.

Santini was trained by her husband Antonio's grandmother, Teresa, who was running the restaurant when Santini married into the family nearly 40 years ago - she had never previously cooked professionally.

Dal Pascatore serves authentic Italian cuisine combined with modern influence, and in 1996 Santini became Italy's first female chef to be awarded three Michelin stars for her kitchen's delectable and imaginative fare.

'At the helm of the culinary dynasty that is the Santini family, Nadia Santini's cheffing expertise has lifted the restaurant to the highest of values,' said a statement from the World's 50 Best Restaurant awards, run by British magazine Restaurant.

The restaurant remains a family affair 
with her husband, Antonio, managing the front of house while their sons 
Alberto and Giovanni also work there.

Previous winners of the annual award that started in 2011 are Elena Arzak, head of the Arzak restaurant San Sebastian, Spain, and French chef Anne-Sophie Pic, of Maison Pic in Valence, France.

The award is decided by votes from 900 international leaders in the restaurant industry who make up the World's 50 Best Restaurants Academy.

Nadia Santini

'There is a growing synthesis of style:
the cuisine now offered by "dal Pescatore" passes from the methods used
by Antonio's mother to Nadia's new sensitivity.

'There are still strong 
links with tradition, but their style is independent, avoiding any sort 
of stagnation in a fixed and inopportune eternity but reaching unique 
balance and harmony.

'The dishes prepared at "dal Pescatore"
are generally derived from family traditions or testimonials collected 
in the vicinity.

'The recipes are almost always adapted to the times: 
"tortelli di zucca" are now served with less butter and less parmesan 
cheese to appreciate the ingredients, returning to their flavours which 
are clear and linear.

'At present there is special attention to the 
dietetic aspect of food, traditional cuisine is being adapted to new 
nutritional systems and a new lifestyle which have a subtle but decisive
influence on the recipes without destroying their original appeal.

The preparation of a dish so that 
its flavours can be enjoyed in their totality, without stealing their 
harmony, also means using light products which do not, however, make it 
too informal or out of the ordinary.

'This is a considerable balancing 
act, absolutely necessary to give our dishes a modern up-to-date 
identity.'
