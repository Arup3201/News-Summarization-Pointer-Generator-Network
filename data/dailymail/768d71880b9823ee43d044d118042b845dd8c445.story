Britons who are planning a post-Christmas holiday in Gambia are being told to steer clear of public gatherings after a flash of violent unrest in the capital.

Gun battles erupted near the presidential palace in Banjul on Tuesday while the West African nation’s president, Yahya Jammeh, was out of the country.

In a televised address the longtime leader, who seized power 20 years ago, denied that it was a coup and claimed the capital was attacked by ‘terrorist groups’ backed by dissidents in the UK, US and Germany.

Following Tuesday's violence the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) has not warned against travelling to Gambia but said it is keeping its travel advice ‘under constant review’ as it encourages holidaymakers to take precautions.

The FCO said: ‘There were reports of gunfire in the early hours of 30 December in the capital, Banjul. The situation is now calm.

‘If you’re in Banjul, avoid public gatherings and monitor local media for developments.’

It said access to Banjul, the international airport and routes to tourist zones are no longer being restricted.

The FCO said: ‘Access to Banjul has been reopened, as the blockade at Denton Bridge has now been lifted and returned to a checkpoint.

‘There are other checkpoints currently operating in Banjul. You should expect your vehicle to be searched if stopped by security forces. ‘Roads on the mainland between the airport and other areas, including the main holiday resort areas, are open as usual. Banjul airport is unaffected and operating as normal.’

Gambia is a popular winter sun destination for Europeans who flock to its nature reserves and beaches on its short stretch of Atlantic Ocean coastline.

A handful of UK tour operators offer package holidays to destinations such as Banjul Beach and Kololi Beach, and the country is visited by an estimated 60,000 Britons per year.

A spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said: ‘Abta always works closely with the Foreign Office in any situation which might affect the safety of passengers, which we have done in relation to the Gambia.

‘Luckily the situation did not worsen and the resorts have remained unaffected.’

The Foreign Office said ‘attacks on tourists are increasing’ in the Gambia and corruption in the country is "endemic at all levels."

During Tuesday’s unrest forces loyal to Jammeh’s regime gained the upper hand and reportedly killed five insurgents. It is not known how many casualties were suffered by the national military.

Soldiers went house-to-house in search of opponents, arresting dozens of military personnel and civilians.

Jammeh, who has since returned to Gambia following the attack, became the country’s leader in a coup in 1994.

During his time in power he has targeted political opponents, journalists and gays and lesbians. He has become one of Africa’s most vocal anti-gay leaders and previously threatened to behead sexual minorities.

It said there has been ‘a period of anti-UK rhetoric by the Gambian president’ following the country’s withdrawal from the Commonwealth in October 2013. It warned visitors: ‘Although this rhetoric has since subsided and anti-UK sentiment among the wider population appears limited, you should avoid discussing politically sensitive topics.’

There has also been an increase in political tension and public demonstrations after disagreements between Gambia and the EU over the deterioration of human rights in the country.
