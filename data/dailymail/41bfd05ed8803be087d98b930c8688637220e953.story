Remains of a former lord mayor of London, a notorious criminal and political activists will be unearthed when excavation of an infamous burial ground is undertaken by the London Crossrail project.

Crossrail-led research has identified the names and backgrounds of more than 5,000 people buried at the old Bedlam cemetery site at Liverpool Street in London.

Names include Sir Ambrose Nicholas, who was lord mayor of London in 1575, and Dr John Lamb (also known as Lam or Lambe), an astrologer and advisor to the First Duke of Buckingham.

Their skeletons are among those of tortured former patients of Bethlem Royal Hospital, thought to have been the world's first mental asylum.

Archaeologists at the burial site on Liverpool Street, London, work to excavate a centuries-old skeleton

Intense archival research has identified the names of more than 5,000 people buried at the Bedlam site in London in the 16th and 17th centuries

Workers divide the Bedlam site into sections in order to carefully excavate the skeleton of a person buried at the cemetery

The site is found beneath Liverpool Street station in the city of London, with thousands of skeletons lying undisturbed beneath it for centuries

Lamb was said to have been stoned to death by an angry mob outside a theatre in 1628 following allegations of rape and black magic.

Others identified in the research, carried out by 16 invited volunteers and covering burials in the 16th and 17th centuries, include victims of riots by 'Fanatiques', noted in the diaries of Samuel Pepys in January 1661. 

Also buried in the area was soldier Robert Lockyer, an activist in England's first democratic political movement known as the Levellers, The Independent reported.

Executed by firing squad in 1649, he became a martyr for the fledgling left-wing group after he refused parliamentarian military bosses' orders that he be sent away from the capital in a bid to mitigate his dissent.

More than 4,000 people were reported to have attended his funeral at Bedlam, wearing green ribbons to show their allegiance to the Levellers.

Crossrail workers recently discovered the gravestone of Mary Godfree, who died in 1665 as a result of the Great Plague

The Crossrail team will use the information when work to excavate 3,000 skeletons from the Bedlam site starts next month.

But with mental patients showing no physical symptoms of illness, determining which of the remains belonged to those treated at the hospital will be near impossible. 

The hospital is considered the first asylum in Britain. 

It has been moved several times since and is now found in Bromley. 

Bedlam burial ground was established in 1569 to help parishes cope with overcrowding during outbreaks of plague and other epidemics.

Crossrail workers recently discovered the gravestone of Mary Godfree, who died in September 1665 as a result of the Great Plague which peaked that year.

Jay Carver, lead archaeologist at Crossrail, said: 'This research is a window into one of the most turbulent periods of London's past.

'These people lived through civil wars, the Restoration, Shakespeare's plays, the birth of modern industry, plague and the Great Fire.

'It is a real privilege to be able to use Europe's largest construction project to uncover more knowledge about this fascinating period of history.

'Our heartfelt thanks go to the volunteer researchers, who have contributed immensely to Crossrail's legacy.'

The archaeological excavations at Liverpool Street are being undertaken by Museum of London Archaeology on behalf of Crossrail.

Scientific analysis of up to 3,000 skeletons will provide new insights into the lives and deaths of early modern Londoners.

The upcoming dig is also expected to uncover medieval and Roman artefacts, and help piece together centuries of history. After excavation, the skeletons will be reburied on consecrated ground.

To date, Crossrail, which will be fully opened in 2019, has found more than 10,000 artefacts from London's long history across over 40 construction sites.

Thousands of Londoners were buried at the site, including Bedlam patients among the first to be treated for psychiatric illness in the 14th century

Researchers will not be able to distinguish between the skeletons of former Bedlam patients and others, with mental illnesses bearing no bodily symptoms

Thousands of people have been buried at the site over hundreds of years. The Royal Bedlam Hospital now operates in Bromley and is considered a leading psychiatric facility

The Bethlem Royal Hospital was the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe, having been founded as a priory in 1247 and converted into a hospital in the early 14th century.

It was founded by Goffredo de Prefetti, who had been elected Bishop of Bethlehem, and was originally located just outside the London city wall, on the site of what is now Liverpool Street station.

Due to the hospital's reputation as the principle treatment centre for the insane, a bastardised version of its name - 'Bedlam' - came to signify madness and chaos more generally.

Although it is sometimes thought to have treated its patients cruelly, most were free to walk around the grounds, and conditions were not much worse than the average home of the period.

In 1674, the hospital's governors decided that the institution should move a few hundred metres to the west to Moorfields, with the area's open space thought to be healthier than its original premises.

Bethlem moved against in 1815, to St George's Fields in Southwark, which is now the site of the Imperial War Museum.

A final move came in 1930 when the hospital relocated to the suburb of Bromley - it is now run by the NHS and is considered to be a leading psychiatric hospital.
