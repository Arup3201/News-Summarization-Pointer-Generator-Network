From free money donated by the British taxpayer to paid-for trips to Magaluf, White Dee - real name Deirdre Kelly - certainly isn't short of freebies.

Now the 16st mother-of-two has racked up yet another, after a clinic on Harley Street gave her a £1,000 'Lipoglaze' fat freezing laser treatment -  a procedure beloved of Binky Felstead, Amy Willerton and Kristina Rhianoff among others - for nothing.

And not content with a single session, Dee says she'll be going back for further treatments and will even pay for them herself as she attempts to shave as much as six inches off her waist.

Slimming down: Dee says she hopes to lose six inches off her waist following a fat freezing lipo treatment

'I was about 21st a year and a half ago but now I’m down to about 16st,' revealed the 42-year-old, who says she has stopped claiming benefits - despite spending months defending her right to pick up disability money for depression along with a jobseeker's allowance.

'A few years ago, when my mum passed away, I was really suffering from bereavement and depression set in,' she continued.

'I would be eating in the middle of the night sometimes and my weight really went up. Since appearing on the TV, I have been better and have been eating healthier food and at better times.

'I’ve still got someway to go but clearly having the Lipoglaze treatment will help speed things along and give me a flatter tummy.'

Lipoglaze works by freezing the fat 
cells that lie beneath the surface of the skin, which die
 after exposure to sub zero temperatures.

On a diet: Dee says she's losing weight 'for myself' and not because of taunts from 'haters'

Over the following fortnight, the dead cells waste away and disposed of naturally by the body - resulting in between two and six inches of fat loss.

'I hope it’s the six inches off for me,' added Dee, who says she is 'looking forward to seeing the results over the next few weeks'.

'Clearly
 this is just the start of losing the weight,' she added, 'and I’ve got to fathom 
that out for myself but I’d definitely like to try it again for my 
thighs and love handles - if I can afford it.'

Despite being subjected to taunts about her weight after Benefits Street aired in January, Dee says her current bid to shed the pounds has nothing to do with 'haters' and is entirely for herself.

'The abuse is mainly because of the benefits or 
because of my weight, but I didn’t have the Lipoglaze treatment because 
of the haters, I had it for me,' she insists.

'I’m not interested in what those types of people think of me, only my friends and family’s opinions count to me.

'My
 kids do joke that I’ve got bingo wings but they only say it as a joke 
and it doesn't bother me, but maybe I’ll come back and have Lipoglaze on
 them next.'

She added: 'The thing why this treatment is so amazing is that it targets the bits 
of fat that are really hard to shift, like your tummy, love handles and 
bingo wings.'

New life: Dee says appearing on Channel 4's Benefits Street has changed her life for the better

Her new life as a reality TV star turned Magaluf club promoter is a far cry from her previous existence as a benefits mum, and Dee says it's all down to appearing on the Channel 4 documentary.

'If you’d said to me that I would be having this treatment in Harley Street a year ago, I would have laughed,' she says.

'I thought that going to a Harley Street clinic isn’t something that the likes of me could enjoy but things have changed for me so much and I now know that anyone can do this if they set their mind to it.

'Just on a regular month with no school uniforms to buy I would be spending £200 a week on fuel, groceries, travel and kids clubs, so a luxury like this would never have happened.

'It’s amazing that since the TV show I can have opportunities like this.'
