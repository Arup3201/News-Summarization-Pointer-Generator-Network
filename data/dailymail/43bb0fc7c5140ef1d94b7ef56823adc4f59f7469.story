Old Bessie can fart up a storm next year and there's nothing the federal government can do about it, judging from a line in the $1.1 trillion federal budget soon to land on President Obama's desk.

The idea of tying the hands of the Environmental Protection Agency, which has long planned to count livestock methane 'emissions' as greenhouse gases for regulatory purposes, is just one of the legislative oddities – known in Washington, D.C. as 'riders' – that made the final cut.

Congress also tut-tutted the Department of Justice, siding with state laws legalizing medical marijuana and telling the feds they can't spend a dime to enforce an overriding national prohibition.

And first lady Michelle Obama's vision of a healthier school lunch program took a hit, with the new law halting efforts to cut sodium levels in foods approved for lunch-lady distribution.

SILENT BUT DEADLY? The federal government wants to regulate cow flatulence on global-warming grounds but farmers have won this round

LOW-SODIUM: School lunch standards won't include a salt ceiling next year, despite first lady Michelle Obama's pledge to fight for every inch of ground on nutrition standards

That move, backed by both food companies and school foodservice officials, will short-circuit a multi-year salt-cutting process that's already in motion. 

A representative of a major multinational packaged food company told MailOnline that her employer doesn't want to create a separate production chain just for school-food institutional customers.

'If all our institutional customers – prisons, hospitals, and so forth – wanted low sodium standards, that would be different,' she said, on the condition that her company's name not be mentioned.

'But at some point it becomes cost-prohibitive to be in the business if there are new contract requirements popping up all the time.'

Food officials and nutritionists in dozens of major markets have complained in recent years about changes to the federal school lunch program, driven largely by Mrs. Obama, that depressed sales as students opted not to buy anything on the menu. 

In addition to a clampdown on low-salt rules until more science emerges about any health benefits, they will also get a pass on rules requiring the use of whole-grain breads and pastas if they can show buying the more expensive staples would create a financial hardship.

One whole-grain option – pizza – would even take a hit if the Obama administration's sodium goals were put on autopilot, warns the School Nutrition Association.

MIXED BAG: Medical pot in DC will be a dead issue in 2015 but the feds won't be able to go after Americans who take advantage of state laws permitting it

'Naturally occurring sodium present in milk, meats and other foods, make the later sodium targets extremely difficult to achieve,' the organization says in a set of talking points obtained by MailOnline.

'Popular and healthy choices such as low-fat, whole grain cheese pizza, macaroni and cheese and deli sandwiches could be stripped from school menus if manufacturers are unable to develop cheeses that meet these extreme standards.'

Getting that cheese to market, along with the rest of what a cow produces, will also be less difficult in 2015 – at least compared with what the EPA had planned.

The agency had planned to fight global warming with a rule requiring farmers and ranchers to report how much methane their livestock produce through belching and flatulence. That was expected to increase the cost of bringing animal protein to market when the EPA followed up with a permitting process designed to shrink a cow's carbon footprint.

But no more.

Ranchers and environmentalists have fought a pitched battle over climate change rules since 2009 when a United Nations report, 'Livestock's Long Shadow,' claimed that farm animals were responsible globally for a whopping 18 per cent of all greenhouse gases.

But in America, the EPA's own numbers showed months earlier that all of agriculture put together only contributed 6 per cent of the U.S. total – and livestock agriculture's portion came to just 2.6 per cent.

In another sector of American agriculture, the burgeoning marijuana cultivation industry, Congress delivered a mixed bag over the weekend. 

The Department of Justice will be forbidden in 2015 from spending any funds to enforce federal pot laws against people taking advantage of state laws that permit the medicinal use of the drug. 

But although a 65-percent majority of Washington, D.C. voters chose to create a medical marijuana program last month, that idea will die on the vine.

The federal budget bill forbids spending money 'to enact or carry out any law, rule, or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use, or distribution' of marijuana or anything made from it.

11th hour sleight-of-hand will prohibit the EPA from penalizing farmers for methane gas emitted by cows

The feds will be prohibited from going after Americans who benefit from state-level medical marijuana laws, even though pot is still illegal federally

School lunches will be safe from the salt police, with Congress clamping down on efforts to bland-i-fy mystery meat and vegetable medleys

A host of other 'riders' were slipped into the 'CRomnibus' bill that had members of Congress scrambling to avoid a government shutdown
