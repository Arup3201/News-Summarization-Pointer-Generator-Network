Meet Nathan McClymont - the Aussie pilot who just might have the best job in the world.

The 29-year-old flies helicopters over the breathtakingly picturesque Great Barrier Reef - the world's largest coral reef system.

Life's pretty good for the commercial helicopter pilot, who's gained quite a following on social media for documenting his enviable lifestyle.

Nathan McClymont is a commercial helicopter pilot in the Whitsundays from Hamilton Island - north of Brisbane

The 29-year-old, who previously worked in IT, says it's always been his dream to fly helicopters

Mr McClymont left his job a year ago piloting choppers in Phillip Island, southeast of Victoria, in exchange for this

Mr McClymont was previously piloting choppers in Phillip Island, southeast of Victoria, but didn't hesitate taking up an offer at the Whitsundays from Hamilton Island - north of Brisbane.

Who can blame him? 

Before that, he bid his IT job farewell to pursue his dream of becoming a pilot.

'I've always wanted to be one since the age of 10, he said.

'But getting a licence to fly helicopters is expensive so I wasn't able to get mine until I was 24.'

For the past year, he's spent his time running charter and scenic tours for couples and showing them some of Australia's natural beauties.

'Everyone's on holidays here so we're all happy,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I feel like I'm relaxing all the time.'

And it appears that Mr McClymont's 2,010 Instagram followers are living vicariously through him as he likes to share his experiences whilst on the job for Hamilton Island Air - whether it be in the air, by the water or simply on land.

However he was too shy to admit that he had the best job in the world.

The pilot says he considers himself lucky because he loves his job

'It's a good job and I'm living a pretty good life here but I'm sure there are better jobs than mine out there,' he said

Although he loves his current job, Mr McClymont has aspirations of becoming a search and rescue pilot

'It's a good job and I'm living a pretty good life here but I'm sure there are better jobs than mine out there,' he said.

'But I'm really lucky because I don't sit here and complain about my job because I love what I do. 

'There's no big downside to this job. The only thing is that we're living on an island so it can get a bit expensive. Sometimes you can also get a bit of island fever. So it's always good to take holidays to other places. Essentially take a holiday from your holiday.'

So when Mr McClymont's needs a break from it all, he likes to go visit the big cities.

'I like to go back to Sydney or Melbourne because it's good to be back to the real world,' he said.

'Then again, it's not every day you get to sleep in a hammock, hang out at the beach and fly helicopters for a living and get paid to do that.'

Having said that, Mr McClymont has aspirations of becoming a search and rescue pilot.
