The Senate has passed an extension of federal spending authority that will last until midnight on Wednesday, staving off the threat of a government shutdown that could have been triggered by early Sunday.

The controversial move, approved by voice vote on Saturday, will give leaders three days to agree on a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund all government agencies except the Department for Homeland Security until September 2015.

Senators were called to the rare weekend session after Republican Sen Ted Cruz blocked  the sweeping motion.

The move - defying his party's leadership - was an apparent bid to sabotage President Obama's immigration plans as a band of conservative Republicans called to immediately defund the program.

Senate Majority Leader Harry M Reid (D-Nev) slammed opponents of the bill, telling the House on Friday: 'I would hope cooler heads prevail and we can move forward and get this done.' 

There were fears even the extension could be scuppered as negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to speed the process along collapsed during late-night talks in the nearly abandoned U.S. Capitol. 

Some senators, angered over the bill's easing of a 'Dodd-Frank' bank regulation law requirement, wanted a shot at removing the provision. 

The 1,603-page spending bill, negotiated by Republican and Democratic appropriators and leaders, narrowly passed the House on Thursday following a battle that exposed fraying unity in Obama's Democratic Party.

A revolt over financial provisions by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, long a staunch Obama ally, led to a day of tension on Capitol Hill on Thursday.

Democrats, aware of the need for unity when Republicans take full control of Congress next year after their midterm election gains, tried to tamp down speculation of a lasting split between Obama and Pelosi.

One leadership aide said Pelosi had fired a warning shot to Republicans that House Democrats would fight hard in the new year.

In the 219-206 House vote, 67 Republicans rejected the spending bill, largely because it failed to take action to stop Obama's immigration order. 

But that was offset by 57 Democrats who voted in favor.

The spending bill would fund all government agencies through September 2015, except for the Department of Homeland Security, which would get an extension only until February 27.

That is the department mainly in charge of implementing the order announced by Obama last month.
