If you thought Christian Louboutin shoes were expensive, think again.

Meet the world's first ever pair of platinum stilettos - all yours, for an eye-watering £70,000.

The Borgezie Platinum Cleopatra Stiletto makes most luxury brands' designs appear positively High Street in comparison.

World first: The House of Borgezie has unveiled the world's first ever solid platinum stilettos, and they come with a price tag of £70,000

The range has been created by bespoke jewellers House of Borgezie, who also created the world's first £100,000 gold and diamond bespoke stilettos in 2010.

Speaking about his brainchild, designer Christopher Shellis said: 'Like the entire Borgezie range, nothing like 
this has been achieved or indeed possible before.

'Due to the extremely 
high temperatures required to work with platinum, it proved to be one of my greatest challenges.

'The Platinum stiletto took over four 
years of development.'

Man power: The shoes take hundreds of hours to create because the platinum has to be heated up to such a high temperature

Girl's best friend: Christopher is the man behind the Eternal Diamond stiletto, which is made using 2,200 brilliant cut diamonds, totalling 30 carats, and costs £100,000

Bling, bling: Clients of the dazzling foot candy include A-listers from the world of football, music and modelling

Platinum has to be fired up to 1,200 degrees to melt and work with; 
each pair took Christopher over one hundred hours to complete. The extravagant finished shoes come with a 1,000-year guarantee.

'The
 end result is a creation of empowerment and liberation and something 
that suspends all women onto a perfect statuesque plinth,' he said of his designs.

Ideal clients: Christopher says he would love to see the Duchess of Cambridge and Nicole Scherzinger wearing his designs, he has even created a bespoke bracelet for Kate

Speaking about his ideal client, Christopher said: 'I love and really respect Nicole Scherzinger as she is the essence of pure femininity and it is my absolute priority and goal to get her wearing something from the range.

'I have made the Duchess of Cambridge a special silver blue enamel butterfly pendant and matching bracelet.'

Making a statement: Luckily, the bespoke heels, retailing from £70,000 to £100,000, come with a 1,000-year guarantee
