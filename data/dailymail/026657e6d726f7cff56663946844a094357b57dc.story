A Russian mother convinced she had been given the wrong baby at a hospital is suing health officials after she finally managed to organise a DNA test - and discovered her suspicion was correct.

Flera Fazlyeva, 54, from the city of Kazan in the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia, gave birth at hospital where her son was accidentally swapped with another baby boy born around the same time in 1986.

After discovering the truth, Ms Fazlyeva contacted Razia Fakarova who had been given her son by mistake.

But tragically, Ms Fazlyeva found that her real son, who had been named Aidar, had died in 2004 in a car accident when he was 18.

Tragic ending: Flera Fazlyeva, 54, (pictured left) discovered her son had been swapped at birth  after 27 years. When she tracked down her biological son, Aidar, (pictured right) she discovered he had already died in a car accident in 2004 when he was 18

Complex relationship: The other mother, Razia Fakarova, (pictured right) is now trying to build a relationship with her biological son Illshat (pictured left)

She said: 'I was at the hospital on July 3, 1986. I knew as soon as they put the baby in my arms that something was not right.

'I told them then that they had given me the wrong baby and refused to take it, but then a nurse and a doctor came to me and explained to me that it was impossible, as the baby had been given a special tag right after birth.

'They pointed out that tag and told me it was just because I was tired after the ordeal of giving birth. They said that the baby and I would eventually bond.

'I couldn't shake off the feeling though, and my family didn't believe me either. We had a meeting where we decided that as we couldn't afford any medical test to check if my feeling was right, I would have to accept the baby, and I raised him as my own.

'By the time I learned about the possibility of a postal DNA test and that we could afford it, it did not give me any satisfaction when it confirmed my suspicions, and it didn't give me back my real son.

Razia Fakarova, 56, admits it has been difficult to come to terms with knowing the son she buried, Aidar (pictured left as a child and right when he was a teenager), was not actually her own child

Joint battle: Both Flera Fazlyeva (pictured left) and Razia Fakarova (pictured right) are suing over the mistake. If successful, they plan to buy a house with the compensation money so their families can live together

'In fact, it took years of pressure for 
me to track down the mother of my boy. I couldn't believe it when she 
told me that Aidar had died in 2004.'

The son she had raised, Ilshat, now aged 27, has now met his real mother but said he did not feel any emotional connection to her.

He admits he now feels lost and confused about the whole saga.

He said: 'I always felt as if my mother who raised me was distant in some way, although she always did her best for me. Yet now I know that my real mother was someone else I don't feel that connection to her.'

Razia Fakarova, 56, the biological mother of Ilshat, added: 'I lost my son and I buried him but with this bizarre twist I then found that actually it wasn't even my son I buried - but then I was presented with a stranger and they are telling me this is my boy.

Experts believe the families are unlikely to win their legal battle because of the length of time that has passed since the error was made

'It is very difficult for all of us, the young man who is my son is certainly not warm towards me but I can't blame him for that. At best I get a lukewarm hello, and he has never called me mum like Aidaz used to.'

Both women are now suing over the error for more than one million rubles (£16,400) in compensation and plan to buy a house where they can live together if successful.

But experts say they are unlikely to win because of the length of time that has passed since the original mistake took place.

According to Russian law, compensation payments incidents like this are only available for incidents that happened after 1991 when a new compensation law came into effect.

But with the switch having happened in 1986, compensation is only possible if those responsible are still alive and are actively obstructing those who are harmed.

But the hospital say that in their case this is not so, and they are doing all they can to put matters right, although that does not include paying compensation.
