Mario Balotelli has already made an impact at Liverpool. He has never been accused of lacking audacity, and one of the first questions he asked on entering the dressing room on Monday was: 'Who takes the penalities?'

Balotteli has a formidable record from the spot, not having missed one in 26 attempts for club and country until last September.

'He's brilliant at them — and he knows it,' said manager Brendan Rodgers. 'But Steven Gerrard's the penalty taker. Simple.'

Rodgers is smiling but knows he has taken on the most exacting challenge of his managerial career. We will get the first glimpse of how their relationship is working out when Balotelli makes his return to the Premier League at Tottenham.

Rodgers might have got Luis Suarez playing, even after he said he wanted to leave, but successfully channelling the talent of Balotelli would mark him out as an extraordinary man manager. Having worked for years as a youth team coach, Rodgers is relishing the prospect.

'I was excited by it,' he said. 'That was the reason why he was here. I've always had it all my life, with young kids, working with children that were given no hope, to see them flourish. Going to Chelsea, working with inner city kids who needed a chance. People write them off in life, in social life. That was my background all my life.'

And in football's distorted economics, Milan's decision to sell a player of Balotelli's talent for £16 million represents the ultimate write-off. Rodgers said: 'I see Blackburn holding out for £15m for Jordan Rhodes, who's a terrific young talent. But you look at the market and Mario's an absolute steal at £16m in terms of talent.

'But it's about the package and that's where I have to do my work to make sure we can maximise that talent.

'People have asked me: ''Can he play with Daniel Sturridge?'' He'll play where he's asked to play. It was the same with Suarez. He'll play wherever the team needs. If they need to play two central, they'll do that. If one needs to play wide, they'll do that. If not, one will be on the bench.

'He's a good kid. But you can make young players feel they're more than they are and the ego grows with that. No. You're a talented player, 24 years of age. Come in every day and work your socks off. And that's what he's done. You should have seen him in training this week — doing extras, working on things, practising free kicks, his touch, penalties. Even in the rain.

Mr Versatile: Mario Balotelli could be deployed in tandem with Daniel Sturridge or as a lone striker

'He's got a winning mentality. He came to England and won the FA Cup in his first season at Man City and the league in his second season. He's scored goals at the highest level, both for club and country. And when you see him work on the training field … that's been the big thing. Take away all the background noise, all the stuff that surrounds him. Keep it simple. When you do that the players see his qualities on the training field — which are clear.'

But even Rodgers acknowledges that Balotelli is far from ordinary. 'He's got wonderful charisma on the field,' said the Liverpool manager. 'Just his presence. He has beautiful feet, a lovely touch on the ball, great skill, power, pace, a real aerial threat. Once he picks up the elements of this team and how he needs to work to be in this team, then you've got a player who is a genuine world-class talent.'

On Sunday we will find out how that individuality squares with the Liverpool team ethic. However it turns out, it will certainly be compelling.
