Who are you calling old? Only 6 per cent of over-65 see themselves as 'old'

They may be drawing a pension, but don’t dare call them old.

With role models such as the Queen and Dame Judi Dench – and an increasing life-expectancy – only a tiny fraction of Britain’s over-65s now view themselves as elderly and frail.

A survey of 2,000 aged between 65 and 93 found only 6 per cent feel their age changes the way they live their life and would class themselves as ‘old’.

Over-65s now total a sixth of the 
population and their numbers are set to nearly double from ten to 
19million within the next four decades.

By 2050 one-in-four of the population will be aged over 65.

But
 they raised concerns that ageism was holding them back, with almost 
half of those polled claiming their generation is ignored, while a more 
than a third felt they were treated badly because of their age.

For
 those nearing their retirement years, there is good news - almost half 
of said they were happier post-65 than at any other point in their life.

Despite
 more than 60 per cent refusing to define themselves as ‘old’ because it
 was simply a mindset, almost the same number felt they are more likely 
to be seen as a problem by society.

More
 than three out of five pensioners admit they have not seriously thought
 about the type of care and support they would prefer as they get older,
 leading experts to call for adults to do more to take control of their 
future independence.

With a 
fifth fearing they will be classed as a burden to friends and family as 
they age, This Morning presenter Ruth Langsford said there needs to be a
 fresh discussion of the issues.

She said the stigma about care and support must be addressed by individuals, after she was forced to take tough decisions about her own parents’ care needs.

‘My own wonderful parents ended up bottling up worries and concerns because they feared being seen as a burden to us, meaning we couldn’t talk openly about their needs,’ she said.

The poll was conducted by Invicta Telecare, Britain’s largest independent provider of telecare services, which helps more than 100,000 people live independently in their in their own home.

‘With the number of us aged 65 and over set to increase rapidly, it’s important to tackle the old fashioned taboos that many are coming up against.

'We all need to be prepared to discuss this subject more openly within our families and make sure people get access to the right information and help for them,’ said Wendy Darling, managing director at Invicta Telecare, who carried out the research.

‘It’s clear many worry they will lose their identity and be seen as a problem as they grow older so it’s important not to underestimate the support out there which will give full control of your freedom and independence.’
