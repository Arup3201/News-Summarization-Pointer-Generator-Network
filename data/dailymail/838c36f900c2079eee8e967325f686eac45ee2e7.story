The vast majority of passengers do not trust their train company to be truthful or communicate well wen things go wrong, a survey has found.

Just one in five travellers have a high level of trust in First Capital Connect - the worst rated company - with only a quarter have faith in South-eastern and Southern.

Top of the league table is Merseyrail, which is trusted by 52 per cent of customers, followed by Grand Central at 48 per cent.

However the poll of 4,000 travellers by watchdog Passenger Focus found that passengers are more forgiving of poor service if they feel announcements convey honest information.

Equally the majority do not trust them to be truthful, fair or communicate well when things go wrong, it says.

As a result passengers treat rail travel as a ‘distress purchase’ to be endured rather than enjoyed, with passengers’ perception of the railways damaged accordingly.

Their report said: 'Customers do not currently feel that train companies are "on their side", acting with their interests at heart.

'Acting with honesty...and treating customers fairly are important for trust, but are areas where train companies perform less well than they do on punctuality.' 

Busy commuter services across London and south east England inspired the least trust, according to the report.

South West Trains was trusted by just over a quarter of its customers and First Great Western by 27 per cent, which angry passengers have dubbed ‘Worst late Western’ following complaints about punctuality and overcrowding. 

Behind them are London Midland with 27 per cent and Greater Anglia with a third.

By contrast, among those with the highest levels of trust is Grand Central with 48 per cent, Chiltern Railways with 47 per cent, Virgin trains with 46 per cent and C2C with 45 per cent.

London and the South East rate worst on ‘trust’, driven largely by high fares, poor punctuality and overcrowding

They are followed by the state-run but soon to be re-privatised East Coast at 44 per cent and ScotRail at 43 per cent.

The report says that although passengers do complain about late running trains, firms which communicate well, explain the problem and offer some relief are much more trusted than those which appear distant and untroubled by their passengers’ plight.

It says: ‘ Although the punctuality of the service is important, being open and honest in communicating with customers about the reasons behind any delay is also critical.’

On the importance of trust it concludes: ’The best performing train operating companies (TOCs) all have relatively high levels of trust and low levels of distrust, reinforcing general positivity towards the rail industry.’ 

Noting how commuter services in London and the South East rate worst on ‘trust’ – driven largely by high fares, poor punctuality and overcrowding - it adds: ’ Having a punctual and reliable service is essential in building trust and this is known to be particularly important for commuters as they are reliant on train companies to get them to work, and currently rate punctuality lower than other passenger.’

It says: ’While improving punctuality is a key starting point, communicating openly and honestly with passengers when there are any problems is also vital.

‘Improving performance on these measures could help put passengers in a more positive state of mind when things do go wrong.’

It concludes: ’There is low trust in the service delivered by train companies since they are perceived as failing to deliver.’

Despite this, rail as a whole is rated closer to supermarkets and airlines ‘than more maligned industries such as banking and energy.’

But the report notes: ’However, while passengers are fairly positive about the industry, few would recommend rail as a way of travel’.

Passenger Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: ‘There is much that train companies - and governments - can do to improve trust. It is important for train companies to get the basic service right ahead of everything else.

‘Passengers should feel that train companies are ‘on their side’.
