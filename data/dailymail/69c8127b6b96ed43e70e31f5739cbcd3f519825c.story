When Jackie Sharp lost her cat Dallas in 2000, she had resigned herself to the fact that she would never see him again.

Her cute cat had been with her through good times and bad as she lived in Petaluma.

At the age of 3, Dallas disappeared into a creek near her home.

'I was going through my first year of college at Santa Rosa Junior College, and it was crazy and stressful,' said Jackie to the Petaluma Argus.

'It was horrible,' she said. 'I was looking everywhere for him. It was very sad. I loved that cat. At the end of the day I would come home and he would just curl up on my lap and purr. He was always there for me. He got me through a lot.'

Last week, she received a call from the VCA Animal Care Center in Rohnert Park saying that they had her cat.

'I was in shock,' said Jackie, 34. 'It has been 13 years. I figured he had found a new home or was gone by now.'

In the intervening years, Jackie moved away but always kept pictures of Dallas and occasionally paused to wonder what happened.

Jackie was able to be tracked down because Dallas had a microchip implanted in his neck when he was a kitten.

The devices, which are about the size of a grain of rice and are used on dogs, cats and other pets.

They carry a unique identification number, which is linked to the owner’s contact information.

Dr. Robin Schaffner, the emergency veterinarian who treated Dallas said that the cat was close to dying and would probably have been put down had the vet not found the microchip.

'He was completely dehydrated and emaciated. He probably would have passed away within hours without aggressive treatment. The microchip saved his life,' Dr Shaffner said.

It took her awhile to realize they were talking about Dallas.

'It was so amazing,' she said. 'He was the coolest cat ever and I missed him so much.'

Incredibly, a man discovered Dallas in the same creek where he disappeared in 2000.

He was taken to Laurie Atwood who feeds some of the cats living by the creek.

She says that she was determined he would survive, 'It’s not going to be easy, but if this cat can do it, I can do it.'

Dallas was given life-saving treatment and put on a feeding tube and given a blood transfusion.

Last weekend, Jackie was able to take him home.

She says that Dallas recognised her the moment he entered.

'He stared at me, then he climbed up into my lap and started to purr,' she said. 'I always loved his eyes with those grey specks in them. Once I saw his eyes, I knew it was him. He’s a fighter. If he can make it through living in a creek for 13 years, he can make it through anything.'
