Barcelona have agreed to sign defender Douglas Pereira from Sao Paulo for £3.19 million, the Catalan giants confirmed on Tuesday.

The transfer fee could rise by another £1.2 million due a clause in the contract based on the amount of games the 24-year-old right back plays for his new club.

Pereira will join the La Liga side on a five-year deal pending a medical later this week in Spain, Barcelona said on their website.

His signing is the latest in a busy off-season for Barcelona, who are prohibited from signing players in the next two transfer windows after they were found to have breached rules on the signing of underage players.
