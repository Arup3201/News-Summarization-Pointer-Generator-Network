Catured: U.S. officials have not confirmed the capture of Anas al-Libi, but his family has said he was captured from in front of his home by armed commandos

The three-vehicle ambush that resulted in the Saturday kidnapping from Tripoli of a Libyan terrorist accused of planning the bombings of multiple United States Embassies was the culmination of an international manhunt spanning three decades.

Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, known more commonly as Anas al-Libi, is said by US officials to be the mastermind behind the Aug 7, 1998, twin bombings of United States Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya.

The terrorist has long been on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s most-wanted list, with a sky-high $5million bounty for his head.His capture is a significant victory for the United States in its war on terror.

Hunted by the US since being identified as the planner of the twin bombings, al-Libi had publicly renounced violence in the years after the terror attacks and turned to computer programming. The wanted man had even been granted political asylum in Britain.

Captured while parking a car outside his home in the Libyan capital, Mr al-Libi, 49. Is believed to have returned to Libya in 2011 at the request of one of Dictator Moammar Gadhafi’s sons. 

The desperate despot had begun trying to further consolidate power during the beginning days of the Arab Spring through reconciliation with militants who renounced violence.

Coordinated: Anas al-Libi was one of the planners of both the US Embassy in Tanzania bombing (pictured here) and the US Embassy in Kenya bombing

Lethal: Over 200 people were killed in the twin 1998 attacks, with 11 dead in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (pictured here with then-US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright touring the bombed-out site)

Mr al-Libi’s son died a year after the family returned to Tripoli, in a firefight  during the 2011 civil was that resulted in the ouster and execution of Mr Gadhafi.

Though said to be tied to the terror organization decades after engineering two of its most successful attacks to that point, it’s not clear exactly what his role was within the organization. He is characterized by US officials as a senior member.

The coordinated twin bombings went off within minutes of each other on either side of 10:30am local time, killing 213 in Nairobi and 11 in Dar es Salaam. Well over 1,000 people were reported injured, according to the FBI.

Horrific event: Volunteers and rescue workers remove bodies of the over 1,000 injured in the attack on the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya

Catastrophic: This is what remained of one of the buildings in the US Embassy complex in Nairobi, Kenya after the 1998 bombings

The bombings were the first to bring the al-Qaeda terror group’s name into American households.Mr al-Libi was indicted in court for the attacks in the Southern District of New York. Though the charges still stand, it is unclear if he will face a domestic trial for the attacks.

The Tripoli University graduate, an expert on electronic and nuclear engineering, was granted asylum in Britain in 1995 after fleeing Sudan. It is not clear how he was granted asylum.

Mr al-Libi lived in Manchester until being added to the FBI’s most wanted list in 2000. Though rumored to have been held in a secret CIA prison, the wanted man did not surface until 2011, when he returned to Libya after decades away.
