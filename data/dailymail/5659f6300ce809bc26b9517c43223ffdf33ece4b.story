The parents of murdered bride Anni Dewani have spoken out, condemning her husband Shrien over their daughter's killing.

After watching the British millionaire take the stand in South African yesterday, Anni's parents, father Vinod Hindocha and his wife Nilam, have said that regardless of the courts findings, their son-in-law is responsible.

Mr Hindocha said Dewani was guilty the moment he abandoned Anni in a taxi and left her to the mercy of hijackers when the pair were meant to be enjoying their honeymoon together.

Mr Hindocha and his wife Nilam said that regardless of the court's findings they think Dewani is responsible for their daughter's death because he left her at the mercy of their hijackers  

Mr Hindocha and his wife, who are pictured with a picture of Anni as a girl, said their daughter comes to them in their dreams seeking justice, and that they hope the trial will finally offer them closure

He told The Sun: 'It's up to the courts to decide if he is guilty or not. But in our eyes he was guilty the moment he left Anni. He should have fought for my daughter.'

Dewani has denied involvement in his wife's murder, saying that he was forced from the taxi he was sharing with Anni by robbers as they drove through a crime-ridden area of Cape Town. She was found dead from a gunshot wound to the neck hours later. 

The prosecution says the 34-year-old paid hitmen £1,200 to kill Anni during the fake robbery organised by his taxi driver Zola Tongo.

Mr Hindocha refuses to accept Dewani's version of events.

He said: 'Anni was his wife, his newlywed. The man holding the gun was half his weight and half his strength. He could have overpowered him or offered him more money.'

Yesterday Anni's family, including her older sister Ami and other family members, gasped in court as pictures from the murder scene were shown, and Dewani revealed he was bisexual and had used male prostitutes.

Anni and Dewani met through mutual friends on holiday in the UK and married in Mumbai, India in October 2010 

But for Mr Hindocha, the proceeding offered some relief. 

He said: 'For the past few years we haven't been able to start the mourning process. There's been no rest.

'For as long as this trial has been hanging over us, Anni has still been alive. But now we are so relieved to be moving towards being able to grieve for our daughter.'

Three South African men have already been jailed over Anni's murder.

Mr Hindocha said for too long the case has centred on Dewani, and not what happened to Anni.

He said Anni came to him every night in his dreams, asking for justice.

Mr Hindocha hoped the trial would turn the 'torture' of the last few years into the 'closure' the family needed. 

Home tycoon Dewani and Swedish-born Anni met through mutual friends on holiday in the UK and had a long-distance relationship for 18 months. 

They then married in a lavish ceremony in Mumbai, India in October 2010. Three days into their honeymoon Anni was killed.

On the stand yesterday, Dewani confessed to sleeping with Leopold Leisser – nicknamed the German Master – and other escorts he had met online or in gay clubs. 

Dewani suggested the sex with men was merely a question of physical encounters with virtual strangers.

He said: ‘My sexual interactions with males were mostly physical experiences or email chats with people I met online or in clubs, including prostitutes such as Leopold Leisser.

‘My sexual interactions with females were usually during the course of a relationship which consisted of other activities and emotional attachment.’

Leisser, who is expected to be a prosecution witness, has told how he met the tycoon for drug-fuelled sex games three times during the build-up to the latter’s wedding.

Dewani, from Bristol, is said to have begged him to humiliate and racially abuse him.

Dewani told how a few months after meeting his future wife he had testosterone replacement therapy because of ‘abnormally low hormone levels’ which he was warned might have harmed his chances of fatherhood.

But he insisted he was instantly physically attracted to his wife when they first met in May 2009, and he sensed there was a mutual chemistry. 

Dewani, who is being held at Cape Town’s Valkenberg psychiatric hospital, appeared distracted for much of the hearing yesterday. 

The court heard the couple's relationship was marred with conflicts from the very beginning.  

Dewani said: ‘We were both headstrong and often argued with each other.'

The couple went on separate holidays at the end of 2009 and, in January 2010, Anni ended the relationship by email.

However, they were back together within two months and began planning a future together, including designing their Bristol and London properties with custom-made ‘his and hers’ wardrobes.

But a few weeks later, in May 2010, they had another row and Anni phoned him in an ‘angry frame of mind’. He responded with a letter saying: ‘If you really think being with me is not going to make you happy then this is not right for you.

‘I really hope that is not what you are saying but I don’t want to feel like I have forced you into something.’

Dewani said the couple made up after she assured him that she wanted to marry him, despite some misgivings. The following month he flew her to Paris in a private jet and proposed.

She accepted but their problems continued as they planned their wedding in India.

They argued over everything from the colour of the decorations to the clothes they should wear.

The disagreements culminated in Anni storming out of a hotel they were staying in.

Dewani said: ‘She sent me a text to say that she could no longer go through with the wedding and wanted to call it off.

‘She said that I was too controlling and that I involved myself too much in all of the detail.’ Dewani said they eventually made up because ‘we agreed that whilst at times we really frustrated each other, we were in love and we wanted to be together’.
