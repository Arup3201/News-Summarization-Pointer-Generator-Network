Within minutes of confirmation he had scraped home in the battle to protect the union, David Cameron immediately tried to regain the initiative by promising ‘English votes for English laws'.

But what quickly became clear is that he is a million miles from being able to explain how he would honour his commitment – and that what he may end up proposing is likely to fall well short of the demands of many Tory MPs.

Backbenchers, led by John Redwood, say that, as a quid pro quo for giving the Scots new powers over tax, benefits and finance, Scottish MPs should be stripped of the right to vote on these issues at Westminster, when they relate solely to England.

The Scots would also lose the right to vote on other devolved issues such as the NHS and education.

Addressing the nation Prime Minister David Cameron vowed to listen to 'millions of English people', beginning what could be a new and potentially equally acrimonious fight to introduce 'English votes for English laws'

Under the backbench idea, favoured by some Cabinet members, Westminster would continue to be the home of the UK Government. But it would most likely hold two different sittings.

MPs from across the UK would sit to discuss issues such as defence, foreign policy and immigration.

Separate sessions would then take place, attended solely by English MPs, possibly in the form of a grand committee, to vote on English only matters, like the Heath Service.

The Prime Minister knows this idea will be popular with many of his backbenchers, who have long being angry over the so-called West Lothian question – indeed, without such a pledge, they may not agree to vote for the package of bribes he promised to Scotland in his last-ditch bid to avoid a Yes vote.

In a carefully-crafted soundbite, Mr Cameron said: ‘I've long believed that a crucial part missing from this national discussion is England. We've heard the voice of Scotland, but now the millions of voices of England must also be heard.

'The question of English votes for English laws, the so-called West Lothian question, requires a decisive answer.

'So just as Scotland will vote separately in the Scottish Parliament on their issues of tax, spending and welfare so too England as well as Wales and Northern Ireland should be able to vote on these issue - and all this must take place in tandem with and at the same pace the settlement for Scotland.'

But his statement begs far more questions than it answers and William Hague, speaking after the Prime Minister, ruled out the idea of an English Parliament.

Mr Hague said: ‘I don’t think people in this country will want, and I don’t think our work will lead to more expensive government and politics.’

Alex Salmond's Yes campaign was forced to face a convincing defeat as 55 per cent of Scots opted to stay as part of the United Kingdom in the historic independence referendum

Instead, Government aides are pointing to two existing reports on constitutional change. One is called the McKay report, and the other was penned by Ken Clarke.

These would mean that when a Bill went through Parliament on the likes of health or education, there would be certain stages at which only English MPs could vote.

Most likely, only English MPs would be able to amend the legislation.

But, crucially, Scottish MPs would still be able to vote on the general principle.

This, to many Tory MPs and supporters, could hardly be said to constitute ‘English votes for English laws’. Doubtless Ukip will have a field day pointing this out.

What is certain is that Labour’s high command hates any suggestion of the idea that Scottish MPs should be stripped of their powers.

Douglas Alexander, himself a Scottish MP, said it was a ‘knee jerk response... driven more by politics than the needs of the constitution’.

It’s not surprising Labour are opposed, since turkey’s don’t vote for Christmas.

Currently, the party has 40 MPs in Scotland who can be relied on to agree with the party command’s position on the supposed evils of NHS reform, opposition to Michael Gove’s school reforms and the rest.

Strip them out, and the party at Westminster would be weakened considerably.

Indeed, based on current opinion polls, it could spell chaos for Ed Miliband. At present, he is on course to win in 2015 with a majority of around 30 seats.

Take out the Scots and he would no longer command a majority in England on his pet subjects of the NHS and education. He may even struggle to carry finance bills – though it’s far from clear what voting rights Scots MPs would have on this issue. 

For instance, they may be unable to vote on income tax, which is being devolved to the Scots, but be given a say on everything else.

Some are even questioning whether – if Scots are no longer able to vote on crucial matters relating to England – there could ever again be a Scottish Prime Minister, Chancellor, Health Secretary, Education Secretary or Work and Pensions Secretary.

In recent years, that would have meant no Gordon Brown, no Alistair Darling and no John Reid at Health, for starters.

Any plans to ban Scottish MPs from voting on English issues could be opposed by Ed Miliband's Labour party, as they currently have 40 MPs in Scotland who are relied on to tow the party line when it comes to big issues 

So what happens next?

Mr Cameron says he wants to drive the changes through before the General Election, which seems an awesome task.

If Labour does oppose the plans, could the PM rely of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats to force them through?

Mr Clegg is on the record as saying it is unfair for Scots to continue to vote on English only matters.

But, on the other hand, the Lib Dem betrayal over boundary reform taught Mr Cameron not to trust his deputy as far as he could throw him.

Certainly, Mr Clegg would demand sweeteners of his own, such as extra powers for the English regions and the great cities of the north. This, in turn, would not necessarily be popular with Tory MPs…

In other words, it could turn into a nine-month constitutional car crash which dominates the remainder of the Parliament and has the capacity to turn very ugly indeed.
