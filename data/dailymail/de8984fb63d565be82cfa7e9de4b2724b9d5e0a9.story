Motoring enthusiasts can now buy a $2 million (£1.2 million) sports car that can be driven underwater.

The ‘Submarine Sports Car’, inspired by James Bond's famous sub-Lotus, is powered by an electric motor that allows it to reach a maximum speed of 75mph (121kph) below the waves.

It claims to be the only vehicle that drives as well underwater as it does across land.

The design is inspired by the submarine Lotus Elan in 1977 film, The Spy Who Loved Me, which was more angular in shape. 

The new version of the submarine car is a convertible that floats when first driven into water.

The two-seated vehicle then submerges with the pull of a lever, which sends it deeper underwater.

Joy ride: The car is fitted with propellers at the rear and two water jets mounted behind rotating louvers at the front of the vehicle which provide steering and lift. It has two built-in scuba tanks and diving regulators to allow two people to remain underwater for up to an hour

Last year, a submarine car driven by Roger Moore as James Bond in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me sold at auction for £880,800 (£550,000).

While it sold under estimate, it can't be driven on the road, but can be used as a submarine.

The Lotus was nicknamed 'Wet Nellie' during filming and was built by a former Navy SEAL at a cost of around $100,000 (£62,439) - the equivalent to $500,000 (£312,196) today.

Although Roger Moore starred as Bond in the film, the submarine car was driven by retired Navy Seal Don Griffin during underwater filming.

Another version of the famous sub-aquatic car is currently listed on Ebay for $1million (£624,393).

The car, listed by classic car dealer Hot Rod City, has fins and retractable wheels but no engine.

The car is fitted with propellers at the rear and two water jets mounted behind rotating vent-like louvers at the front of the vehicle, which provide steering and lift.

It has two built-in scuba tanks and diving regulators to allow two people to remain underwater for up to an hour.

The zero-emission vehicle has the same steel chassis used in the Lotus Elise.

It has a 54kW 160NM electric motor inside, which is powered by six 48-volt Lithium-ion batteries.

They last for 18 miles (29km) on land and provide power for three hours underwater after a four hour charge.

The interior in the car is impervious to fresh or salt water and an on-board laser-guided sensor enables it to cruise along autonomously.

Measuring 12ft 6inches (3.8metres) long and 6ft 4inches (1.9metres) wide, the car weighs 145 stone (921kg).

It can be bought from online retailer Hammacher Schlemmer.

Iconic: James Bond's car was designed to convert into a submarine when underwater. This diagram shows its special features, including retracting wheels, a periscope, harpoon gun, oil release mechanism,  missile launching system and more weapons, which the new imitation lacks 

Roger Moore (pictured) made the car famous, which was designed especially for the James Bond film. While there is one currently listed on eBay for $100, it lacks an engine
