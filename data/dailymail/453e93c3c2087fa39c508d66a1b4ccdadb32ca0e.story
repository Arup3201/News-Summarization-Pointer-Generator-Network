A man who has been left with a scalp riddled with more than 50 dent-like scars after hair-loss surgery went horribly wrong has decided to go under the knife again in a bid to fix it.

Graham Ryder, 51, was left with a cluster of deep scars across the top of his head following an attempted hair transplant, and electrolysis in an attempt to fix it. 

The electrical project manager, from East Finchley, faced many men's worst nightmare when he lost his hair at a young age.

Graham was left with a cluster of deep scars across the top of his head following an attempted hair transplant

The result of a bad hair transplant and subsequent electrolysis has left Graham with 50 deep scars  

'You have to bear in mind that when I lost my hair I was 22, which was nearly 30 years ago, and that was the age of big hair,' Graham explains on Channel 5's Botched Up Bodies.

'At the time I suppose it affected me quite deeply and I was borderline desperation.'

After research, Graham decided to pursue his dream of a full head of hair and booked in for a hair transplant.

'Initially the transplant seemed to work and offered a solution,' he said.

'However as my natural hair started to receded more it exposed the transplanted area, which grew in a very tufty sort of fashion, which obviously looked unsightly.

'It looked like a toothbrush. It got the point where the results of the surgery looked worse than having no surgery at all.'

Graham has decided to have one last attempt at correcting the effects of the initial surgery

Graham says that the effects of his disastrous surgeries are worse than being bald  

After his initial disastrous procedure, a desperate Graham tried electrolysis to remove the abnormal hair growth.

However, while this did remove the tufts of hair, it has left Graham with about 50 indented scars on the top of his head.

'On a daily basis when you look in the mirror it's something that you can't avoid seeing because it's in your face. It challenges me and it does make me feel low.'

Graham's partner Maria Sierra is aware of the deep psychological effect the scars have on Graham, saying: 'I know it is always in the back of his mind. It's something that bothers him quite a bit.'

Dr Gregg's  series of surgeries aim to remove the deep scars and stitch them over

Although the procedure cannot remove the scars completely, they are markedly less deep and Graham hopes that further operations will improve their appearance even further 

Deeply unhappy with his appearance, Graham has decided to have one last attempt at correcting the effects of the initial surgery, visiting specialist hair surgeon Dr Greg Williams.

Dr Greg suggests a series of surgery that remove the deep scars and stitch them over. 

But the severity of his scarring means that Graham is warned he will never totally be able to remove the puck-like dimples in his scalp, and that improving them will take numerous surgeries over a two year period. 

However, Graham's outlook is far more positive after the first surgery.

'Obviously there is still some indentation, but it's less noticeable. I want to carry on with the surgeries and try to improve it.'
