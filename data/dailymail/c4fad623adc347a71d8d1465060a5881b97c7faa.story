Jeremy Clarkson is so well known for ruffling feathers that he virtually makes a living out of it.

But it seems the Top Gear presenter is running out of human victims – and is now making enemies in the world of birds.

After he appeared on BBC TV’s nature-watching programme Countryfile last Sunday, to an audience of 6.8million, a police wildlife officer reported him for allegedly interfering with barn owls.

Probe: The Countryfile episode followed Chris Packham and Jeremy Clarkson as the pair discussed barn owls at his Oxfordshire home

Spotted: A barn owl flew from the barn in the farm building of Clarkson's home as the duo approached

According to Josh Marshall, a scene in which Clarkson and Countryfile presenter Chris Packham approached the owls’ nesting box appeared to be in breach of the Wildlife and Countryside Act – and irresponsibly encouraged millions of viewers to commit a similar offence.

PC Marshall first took to Twitter with his claim that the pair should have got a licence for filming and disturbing the nest, then contacted the BBC. He went on to tell the government agency Natural England, along with the Barn Owl Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

And Thames Valley police yesterday confirmed they were ‘investigating a report of a reckless disturbance of birds’. The alleged offence carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail.

A BBC spokesman insisted that Countryfile had behaved correctly. But research of Clarkson’s history suggests he might have form in the barn owl molestation department. Ten years ago he apologised on Top Gear for ‘joking’ that he would kick one of the birds to death for fun.

And three years ago he boasted that by hooting his Range Rover’s horn he managed to ‘scare a family of barn owls you would normally need a night vision lens and a night without sleep to see’.

His latest brush with birdlife came when he welcomed Packham to the Oxfordshire farm he bought in 2009.As he showed the Countryfile presenter around the farm, as part of a programme to promote a nature photography competition, he led him to a nesting box in a derelict building and showed him some of the food pellets ejected by owls.

‘I want to get more butterflies and many many many more birds,’ said Clarkson. ‘I’ve got some owl boxes that might have barn owls in them.’

As they drew close to the box, two of the magnificent birds were apparently startled into emerging and flying off. Minutes after the programme was aired, Devon and Cornwall wildlife and countryside officer PC Marshall tweeted: ‘Did Clarkson and Packham have the appropriate licence to approach that barn owl nest on Countryfile tonight??’

He added: ‘Irresponsible to show that behaviour without warning people watching that you need appropriate licences, without is an offence.’

Online on his personal blog, PC Marshall, a keen birdwatcher and former soldier currently spending his holiday thwarting songbird trappers in Cyprus, added: ‘Jeremy Clarkson, Chris Packham and the film crew knowingly approached a barn owl nest site causing the birds to leave the nest. They stayed around and filmed the site.’

The BBC spokesman said: ‘Countryfile took expert advice before approaching the barn and we do not believe there was a breach of wildlife law. No one from the team entered the barn while the birds were there or approached the nest directly. Countryfile would never knowingly do anything that has a detrimental impact on wildlife.

‘Viewers are encouraged to take their photos responsibly and there is guidance about how to do that on the programme website.’ Packham – who is president of the Hawk & Owl Trust – said: ‘I’ve been doing this kind of work for years and I’m confident there was no disturbance of the barn owls.’

Surprisingly, PC Marshall himself had managed to cause offence when he briefly appeared on Countryfile the previous week.

He seemed to suggest pigeon fanciers were responsible for the persecution of peregrine falcons, although he later blamed the way the programme was edited.
