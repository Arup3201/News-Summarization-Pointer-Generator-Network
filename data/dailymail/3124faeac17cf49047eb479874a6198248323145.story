A British Army sapper who raped a woman seven times in a ‘humiliating and degrading’ ordeal has been jailed for ten years and dismissed from the service.

Kenyan-born Robert Kariuki attacked the woman in her bed, stuffing a teddy bear in her mouth and covering her face with a pillow after she had spent the night making love with his friend.

He threatened to kill his victim and stopped her from leaving her room to even use the toilet during a ‘sustained’ series of seven rapes over several hours.

Horror: The victim was attacked at her flat in Paderborn, a garrison town in Germany

Unsuspecting: The victim had invited Robert Kariuki back to her flat in Paderborn, with another friend

The incident happened in July last year. The woman, a German, had invited Kariuki and another soldier to her flat for drinks in the army garrison town of Paderborn.

She was estranged from her British army husband at the time. The court heard she ‘willingly’ had sex with the defendant’s comrade in her bedroom while he slept on her sofa.

A British Army Corporal who nearly killed a Scottish veteran with a single blow has saved his career because of ‘racial taunts’ which led him to the attack.

A court martial in Germany heard how Royal Logistics Corps Cpl. Kennedy Makunde lashed out after twice being called a ‘black bastard’ by Sgt. Wayne Forbes at a pub in the garrison town of Fallingbostel.

The court at Sennelager heard that Sgt. Forbes' ‘personality changed’ when he drank, perhaps leading to the altercation with Cpl. Makunde, 32.

Makunde struck the senior NCO, who collapsed and hit his head on the hard floor of the Flic-Flac pub and restaurant causing a life-threatening injury that needed almost immediate surgery.

Cpl. Makunde, 32 of 7 Regiment, RLC, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm at the court martial but avoided jail because the court accepted he had been provoked by the ‘aggressive’ Sergeant.

He was given six-months’ detention, suspended for a year, and reduced to lance corporal.

But when his friend left the apartment at 7.00am the following morning he went into her room, woke her up and began his rapes.

The court martial in Sennelager, Germany, heard how he was ‘jealous’ because she was not attracted to him, even though the woman considered him a friend.

Kariuki claimed sex had been consensual and that he had not been aware of what had gone on earlier that morning in the victim’s bedroom.

Kariuki, based in Germany with 35 Engineer Regiment, was imprisoned for 10 years after being found guilty at an earlier hearing on seven counts of rape, two counts of threats to kill, and one of false imprisonment.

The defendant, who has relatives in the UK, America and in Kenya, was ‘dependable and industrious’ and had been earmarked for potential promotion to officer, the court was told.

Judge Advocate Alan Large said the fact that Spr Kariuki did not use a condom and forced the complainant to perform oral sex were aggravating features in the case.

Sentencing Kariuki, he told him: ‘This was a sustained series of offences. The victim trusted you to stay in the lounge and sleep there.

‘You subjected her to deeply humiliating and degrading sexual violence.’

He will serve his time in a British civilian jail.
