Rather than cheering him on from box seats at Sunday's Super Bowl, Demaryius Thomas' mother and grandmother will be supporting the Broncos wide receiver from prison.

Katina Smith and her mom, Minnie Thomas, have been cellmates for 14 years, since they were arrested on federal charges of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. Thomas faced 40 years to life, Smith 20 years.

They will sit in a small room, wearing prison-issued gray T-shirts because they're not permitted to wear his orange No. 88 jersey, as Demaryius, who was raised by his aunt and uncle, tries to beat the Seattle Seahawks.

But Smith's fellow inmates at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, Florida, know how much she would love to be there, telling him how proud she is, hugging him before he hits the field.

Instead, she'll call him Sunday morning.

'We pray over the telephone together and I ask him if he's nervous, and I tell him "if you make a mistake, don't beat yourself up," he's bad about that. "...Make sure you keep your team encouraged, pray for them and play your best,"' Smith, 41, told The New York Post.

Smith will pin up a picture of Demaryius and the Broncos in the prison's humble TV room, paint her face in Denver colors and cheer with homemade pom-poms she and her mom crafted from newspaper.

Demaryius was just 11 when he begged his grandmother to stop selling drugs in their home. Shortly after he told his mother he had dreamed someone was going to jail for a long time, the women were busted.

Regrets: Smith said not being there when Demaryius, pictured at a January 19 game, was drafted to the NFL and missing his games has been one of the things she regrets the most

'He was under the impression that I 
sold the drugs,' Smith told The Post. 'I did — and I told him and his 
sisters — I did keep money from my mother on two occasions and that's 
how I got pulled into the whole thing.'

Smith was offered a maximum sentence of eight years if she testified against her mother. But she refused.

A full decade went by before she could tell her son the truth about what happened.

'I
 told him over the telephone,' Smith said. 'I wasn't able to tell him in
 person. But before I was able to tell him in person, his face was like 
he didn't want to be there "Why do I have to come? I don't even like 
coming down here."'

He only visited the prison for the first time in 2003, then again in 2006 and 2009.

She said she needed to apologize so she and her children could move forward with repairing their relationship.

'... it was heavy on my heart. I could talk to him over the phone, and it was like he respected me and he loved me, I knew that, but at the same time, it was something missing. Like the conversations might of been short, or the visits, he was kind of isolated. So I was like, maybe I need to go ahead and tell him and his sisters what really happened so they can make their own decision how they want to deal with it.'

Dealing: The football player's grandmother, Minnie Thomas, pictured right, faced 40 years to life, and Smith 20 years for possessing with intent to deal cocaine

And she was glad she did.

Demaryius immediately responded 'I forgive you.'

'It really made me happy, and our relationship grew from that point on,' she told The Post.

She
 said she apologized again in 2012, and wanted to make it clear that she
 didn't choose her mother over him and his sisters, which she said was 
what a lot of people thought.

'I
 just wanted him to know that I was sorry, and I was sorry for all the 
bad choices that I made that led me to be away from him,' she added.

Smith said not being there when Demaryius was drafted to the NFL and missing his games has been one of the things she regrets the most.

But she cheered him every step of the way during the AFC Championship Game.

'I was nervous, I was shaking, I was sweating, and waving our pom-poms, and I was holding my breath and I was like "Oh my goodness, this is really happening, this is really happening,"' Smith recalled.

And she will be even more full of emotion come kickoff Sunday.

'One of the things is I wish I could be at the stadium, watching the game in person with my 88 jersey, with my pom-poms, and getting the crowd pumped and hyped, to cheer for them,' she said. 'And then being able to see him once they come off the field, and he being able to see my face to know that I'm there to support him and his team.'

Demaryius knows his mother is proud of him.

'My momma, she just told me, "I told you you would make it,"' he told The Post.

'We haven't really talked about it much, but I talked to my grandma and she said the same thing. She got emotional and all, but they just said, "You were going to make it."'

He added that he's driven to play his best because 'they're going to talk about it... in the jailhouse.'

If the football player makes it to the 2017 Super Bowl, Smith might just get her wish to watch her son in person, as she is scheduled to be released on Christmas Day 2016 - Demaryius' 29th birthday.

In the meantime, Demaryius has another visit planned.

'He told me once they win the Super Bowl,' Katina Smith said.
