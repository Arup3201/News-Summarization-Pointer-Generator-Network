This tiny dormouse cheated death after he fell out of his mother’s nest and was almost stepped on by a passerby.

The cute creature found himself stranded on the kerb of a pavement just inches from a busy road when the member of the public walked past.

The helpless baby rodent, which was about three weeks old, had no way of finding his family and was at risk from the cold weather when the kind-hearted person picked him up.

Lucky: Centre supervisor Antonia Blacker with Douglas the dormouse who fell out of his mother's nest

He was taken to the Folly Wildlife Rescue near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where staff named him ‘Douglas’ and worked around the clock to save his life.

They put him in an incubator and fed him Farley’s Rusks and a milk formula every two hours until he built his strength up.

Douglas was less than an inch long when he arrived at the rescue centre and will reach up to 3.5 inches when fully grown.

Annette Risley, centre manager at Folly Wildlife said: 'He was found on a pavement on his own by a member of the public.

Safe: The helpless baby rodent, which was 
about three weeks old, had no way of finding his family and was at risk 
from the cold weather when a kind-hearted person picked him up and rescued him

'He was at a serious risk of dying 
from hypothermia or he could have been stepped on, so the gardener 
picked him up and got him to us.

'We took him in and began a rehydration treatment to get him back to full health and kept him in an incubator.

'He was fed every three hours, even through the night, and has done so well he is now fed just three times a day.

Rodent: The life expectancy of a dormouse is five years and their diet consists of fruit, insects and flowers

'He is making great progress and will 
eventually go to another animal centre before being released into the 
wild in about a year.'

The life expectancy of a dormouse is five years and their diet consists of fruit, berries, insects and flowers.

The
UK dormouse population has dropped by more than 70 per cent over the 
last 40 years due to the declining amount of hedgerows, which are their 
natural habitat.

It is thought there are about 45,000 dormice left in the country.

This
year’s poor weather is thought to have affected their population 
drastically as their food sources dwindle in wet conditions.

Tiny: Douglas is pictured just after his rescue on Friday and he was barely larger than a five pence piece

Survivor: Douglas is growing fast and will eventually return to the wild in about a year when he is bigger
