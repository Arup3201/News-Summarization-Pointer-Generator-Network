A law passed by King Henry VIII 500 years ago could force villagers to foot repair bills for their parish church, despite rarely stepping inside the ancient building.

Three homeowners from sleepy Humbleton, near Hull, East Yorks, have been caught out by the archaic legislation, which states that they are legally obliged to fund repairs costs at St Peter's Church.

The original 'chancel repair liabilities' rule dates back to the 1530s and was altered by Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries.

The local Parochial Church Council of St Peter's Church, in Humbleton, East Yorkshire, has issued letters to residents informing them they are liable to pay for the church's upkeep, withing days of the law expiring without such a warning

When people bought land taken from monasteries, they became 'lay rectors' and had a duty to help repair their local church.

The government looked to abolish the law 10 years ago and gave churches a decade, until October 13 this year, to register properties for chancel repair liability with the land register otherwise they would not be able to make a future claim.

With just three weeks before that 10-year deadline passes, and the local parochial church council has issued letters to people whose properties have historical liability to upkeep the church.

Homeowner Mick Wood, whose farmhouse is less than 600 yards away from the church, said: 'It's utterly terrifying to know that if anything goes wrong with the church, we would be asked to cough up.

Churches were unlikely to be able to make claims against residents using the law from Henry VIIIs realm (pictured), unless they registered all liable properties by October 13

'It's an open cheque book and could bankrupt us if anything serious goes wrong.

'We feel victimised and angry. It is such an old law and one that should be quashed.

'We want to pass the house on to our children for another 100 years. Our children are the future of this village, but the church certainly won't be getting our support.'

Chancel repair liability relates to the historic responsibility for the upkeep of a church being divided between the rector and parishioners.Parishioners' responsibilities were eventually transferred by legislation to the church.

Rectors have historically remained responsible for the upkeep and when their lands were sold, responsibilities were transferred to the new landowners.

These lands need not necessarily be adjacent to church property.

Under the Chancel Repairs Act 1932 a Parochial Church Council (PCC) has the power to serve a demand for the cost or contributions for repairing the church chancel. 

In the event that the owner fails to pay then the PCC can enforce the demand through the courts.

Around one third of parish churches may be entitled to recover cost of repairs from neighbours who own all or part of church's historical land.

Finding out if a property sits on former church land and therefore carries this responsibility can be timely due to National Archive data checks.

Legislation in place since 2003 has given PCC's until October 13, 2013 to register chancel repair liability against affected properties, which should then be informed. 

According to Acces Legal, its lawyers understand that any PCC's which fail to register properties and inform owners by October 13, 2013, will not be able to make claims against them.

However, according to a the Legal Advisory Commission of the General Synog, churches may be able to make claims even if they have not registered liable properties.

It states: 'But even if the liability is not registered within the ten-year period (Oct 2003-Oct 2013), it will still be enforceable after the expiration of that period against the owner of the land until he or she disposes of it.'

Cindy Parsonage, 49, found out she was subject to the historic chancel repair liabilities rule by letter from the Parochial Church Council of St Peter's - and is now desperately looking for a way out of it.

Cindy, whose home is closest to the church, said: 'I am terrified as it just doesn't seem fair - I don't even go to the church. Churches need work all the time. How am I going to afford that?'

Cindy bought her house in Fitling Road seven years ago and was unaware of the law - neighbour Mick inherited the hall, which has been in his wife's family for more than 80 years.

Due to the size and amount of land on Mick's property, he is liable to pay up to 50 per cent of costs.

The law only came to light in 2003 when married couple Andrew and Gail 
Wallbank were told they had to pay £100,000 to fund repairs of their 
ecclesiastical parish's medieval church at Aston Cantlow.

When they tried to challenge the 
demands, the Law Lords found in favour of the Parochial Church Council, 
leaving the couple with a £350,000 bill including legal costs.

They also had to pay a further £36,000 to ensure they were not liable in future.

The Government then passed legislation to amend the law, giving churches a 10-year window to register properties, otherwise losing rights to make claims.

The roof was replaced at St Peter's Church ten years ago but no claim to the lay rectors was made because the church was unaware of the law.

A church council spokesman said: 'We knew it was potentially going to upset some people. We didn't want to alienate those who support us but, at the same time, we had to follow instructions from the diocese in our duty to the church.'

There are currently 15,000 parish churches across England and Wales, with 5,200 of them potentially having nearby residents responsible for funding repairs of the chancel of the church.

Currently, the government advises new land purchasers to carry out checks as to whether they would be held responsible for repair costs.

From next month, chancel repair liability will only bind buyers of registered land if it is referred to on the land register.
