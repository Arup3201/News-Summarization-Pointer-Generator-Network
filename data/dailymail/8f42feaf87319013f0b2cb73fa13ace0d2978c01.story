NHS bosses should brace themselves for a new storm of criticism when 'damning' evidence about Jimmy Savile's hospital sex attacks is revealed, lawyers said today.

Liz Dux,  one of the lawyers representing his victims, said Savile's offences on NHS property were just as bad as those committed on the BBC premises and in some cases much worse.

Dux, of Slater & Gordon, added that more people in the NHS than previously thought knew about what was happening and took no action.

Inquiry: Jimmy Savile at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, where he carried out a series of sex attacks

She said one victim had been assaulted 
while lying on a hospital trolley going to have an x-ray, and another 
was passing in a wheelchair when she was attacked.

Dux told The Sunday Times: 'The evidence against the NHS is as bad [as the BBC] if not worse. I think the degree of knowledge was greater - clearly there was knowledge at the BBC but it was less concentrated. Here we have people seeing him [commit offences] and having direct knowledge.

'The NHS abuses are horrific. There were quite a few rapes on NHS premises. The evidence from the two main hospitals is absolutely damning.'

There are three separate inquiries under way into Savile's crimes, focusing on Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General and Broadmoor hospitals.

It is not just the nature of the offences that has shocked lawyers but also the response - or lack of it - by the staff. One of the victims Dux is representing was a young girl at the time of Savile's attack.

'She was raped and then told a nurse about the attack. The nurse said: "I mustn't say anything or I'll get into trouble",' Dux said.

Leeds General Hospital is one of three hospitals where inquiries are under way into Jimmy Savile's crimes

'There are stories of Savile being on 
top of people in the wards and nurses just saying "Oh, get out Jimmy, 
you shouldn't be in here".'

In an incident at Leeds General, where Savile worked as a volunteer porter, one victim was attacked in the porter's office. When the attack was over, the door was opened from outside by someone other than Savile, as if that person knew what had been happening.

Dux said her clients at Leeds appeared to believe that there were other people assisting him and complicit in his crimes.

In another incident at Leeds Dux said a girl was ignored when she complained to staff that a porter had hurt her and pointed to her groin.

Dux is backing a new system of 'mandatory reporting' to force staff to report any such incidents.

Such is the level of concern about the fallout from the inquiries into Savile's activities in the NHS that GPs have been warned that victims and witnesses distressed by giving evidence may turn up in their surgeries.

The Stoke Mandeville inquiry is due to finish taking evidence soon, while the inquiry at Leeds is progressing.

Dr Bill Kirkup, the lead investigator into Savile's offending at Broadmoor, has now launched an appeal for more witnesses to come forward.

In all, Savile is believed to have committed offences at 14 health institutions - 13 hospitals and a hospice.
