A couple have been fined for failing to control their  six noisy Jack Russell terriers whose barking kept their neighbours awake at night.

Dennis Yates, 71, and his wife Valerie, 63, from Stapleford in Nottingham, failed to comply with an abatement notice ordering them to keep the noise down, a court heard. 

Magistrates were told the couple's dogs were so noisy they drowned out the sound of neighbours' televisions and radios and one said the barking had driven them 'round the bend'.

Other residents complained it was 'like living next to a boarding kennels' and said they were often woken in the early hours by howling and whining.  

The court heard residents complained about the barking dogs at the Yates' £170,000 semi-detached home last year.

Noise monitoring equipment was then installed at their house in July 2014 after residents said the abatement notice had not stopped the problem.

Prosecutor Nicola Dumville said: 'When the equipment was removed, several breaches were identified over the course of a weekend.

'There were over 50 records that captured barking and howling.'

The court heard the couple had previously lived on a 24-acre plot in a £500,000 house with the dogs but were forced to move to a smaller home when Mr Yates was declared bankrupt.

Lauren Manuel, defending, said: 'The couple have had these dogs for a number of years - the eldest is 13 years old.

'They've clearly been dog lovers for a number of years. It's hard to control the dogs and stop them from barking. If the postman comes or the dogs hear noises at night, it's their instinct to bark.

Neighbours on Pasture Road in Staplegrove, Nottingham, complained the dogs were driving them 'round the bend' and said it was 'like living next to a boarding kennels'

'Since the prosecution, they've done everything they can to never really leave the dogs alone. Effectively they don't go out.'

One of their neighbours, who did not want to be named, said: 'They are really whiny, yappy dogs and the sound of their bark goes right through you - it's like someone scraping their nails down a blackboard.

'We have been driven round the bend by the noise, I feel liked climbing the walls some days. You can barely hear yourself think. They are out of control.

'I just hope I can get a good nights sleep now because it has been a nightmare. I haven't been able to hear the radio, it's been that bad.' 

The dog-lovers pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the abatement notice at Nottingham Magistrates Court yesterday.

They were each ordered to pay an £80 fine as well as a £20 victim surcharge and court costs of £548.38.

The couple refused to comment as they left court.
