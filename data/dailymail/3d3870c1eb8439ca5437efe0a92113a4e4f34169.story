Wakaso Mubarak has pledged to win a long-term contract with Celtic and bring ‘glory and victory’ to Parkhead.

With Stefan Scepovic poised to join the Ghanaian international in Glasgow, the 24-year-old winger was paraded by the club yesterday after completing his season-long loan move from Russian side Rubin Kazan.

Celtic are now regrouping after a painful Champions League exit to Maribor on Tuesday and, ahead of today’s Europa League draw, Wakaso vowed to not only give the club a much-needed morale boost but to force Deila to make him a long-term acquisition.

‘I am very happy to be here,’ he said. ‘I will bring glory and victory to Celtic.

‘In my mind I won’t be here for only one season. I know I will make it big and stay with Celtic for a long time.’

Wakaso becomes manager Ronny Deila’s fifth summer signing following the arrivals of Jo Inge Berget, Jason Denayer, Aleksandar Tonev and Craig Gordon.

Sporting Gijon striker Scepovic should add to that list by signing a four-year deal today and sources in Spain last night suggested the Serb has agreed personal terms on a £2.2million move.

Virgil van Dijk meantime remains the subject of interest from Sunderland, Newcastle and Seville although contrary to reports the Black Cats have not yet tabled a bid for the defender.

As he prepared for a campaign in Europe’s secondary competition, Wakaso told Sportsmail: ‘I wanted Celtic to be in the Champions League but unfortunately they couldn’t make it - that is part of the game.

‘We have the Europa League to face and that is like the Champions League, so we need to manage that.

‘It is my ambition to excite the Celtic fans. I want to make it big here and help Celtic be very successful.

‘The history of Celtic boosts my morale and gives me even more motivation to do well.

‘The players who have passed through here also excite me.

‘I want to make history for my country and for the team because I am the first Ghanaian to play for Celtic and I have to set an example for the upcoming ones. I need to make history for the team, for my nation and for myself.’

Russia: Mubarak spent last year at Tubin Kazan, but was in Spain for the five preceding years 

Handed the No 32 jersey after a career that encompassed Elche, Villarreal and Espanyol in Spain before he moved to Russia last year, Wakaso believes his long and winding road to Celtic Park has primed him for the challenge that awaits.

‘I’ve learned a lot and it always makes me feel I can make it great,’ he said. ‘To be great you have to work hard and I’m ready to do it.

‘I don’t really know much about Scottish football but I know a little about Celtic because I have been watching Celtic since I was young and I saw the amazing supporters they have here. And the kind of players that pass through here makes me feel and see that Celtic is a great team to be at.

‘I’m here to build my career up again like I was doing in Spain and to help the team.’

Celtic will discover their Europa League fate today and with Deila’s men almost certainly in pot two they will be hoping to avoid holders Sevilla, Inter Milan and Tottenham as top seeds.

All eyes, however, will be on pot four where they could yet be drawn with Legia Warsaw.
