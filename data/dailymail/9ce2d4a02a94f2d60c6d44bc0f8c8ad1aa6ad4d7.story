A  young driver has escaped serious injury after rolling his vehicle on a remote Northern Territory highway - only to be stung by a swarm of angry bees that escaped his trailer.

Police say the 18-year-old  was towing a trailer with crates full of bees when the trailer's wheel clipped the edge of the road, 17 km north of Katherine on Thursday afternoon. 

Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen said the driver lost control, the vehicle fish-tailed and flipped about 10 metres into scrub land, dislodging the bee crates.

'The bees became angry and escaped,' swarming the area and stinging the man on the face three times, Duty Supt Jorgensen said.

The young driver managed to crawl out with minor swelling and pain, but was otherwise uninjured.

Duty Supt Jorgensen said the bees were more of an issue than the wreckage when they arrived on the scene, as emergency services aren't equipped with bee-keeping hats as part of their personal protection.

According to police, the scene was safely cleared and no charges are expected.
