A five-year-old boy, who survived the Moore tornado in Oklahoma last month, was mauled to death by a Bullmastiff dog on Sunday.

The child, who has not been identified, was killed by the animal at a home in Jessieville, Arkansas where he was staying temporarily while his parents rebuild the family home.

The Garland County Sheriff's Department said that the boy was pronounced dead at a Hot Springs hospital after suffering 'major lacerations' to the head and neck.

Lynn Geiling, 50, was watching 
the boy at the time of the attack and was able to get the dog off of 
him, according to authorities.

She told investigators the dog attacked when the animal saw the boy throwing a tantrum.

Geiling's husband and son put the boy in a vehicle and met an ambulance, which took the boy to the hospital.

The body has been taken to the Arkansas Crime Laboratory for an autopsy.

Hot Springs animal control says the dog was killed by a resident on Monday after it ran away following the attack.

Sheriff's deputy Scott Hinojosa told KLRT: 'The child was putting on some shoes and was crying and upset.

'The dog possibly took that as being aggressive and at that time the child was attacked.'

The
little boy and his two-year-old sister had been staying at the home as 
the family tried to rebuild their house following the devastation in 
Moore, Oklahoma on May 20, 2013.

It is unclear whether the dog owners will face charges.

The EF5 storm that struck Moore, Oklahoma on May 20 killed 24 people along its 17-mile path and injured more than 300.
