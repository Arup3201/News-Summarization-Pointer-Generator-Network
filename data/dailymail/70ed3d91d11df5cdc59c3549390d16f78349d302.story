Thousands of weeping South Africans wearing red or black football jerseys said farewell to murdered national team goalkeeper and captain Senzo Meyiwa at a packed stadium in the Indian Ocean city of Durban today.

The mood was in part sombre, with red-eyed fans sobbing or blowing into tissues as a hearse carrying the 27-year-old's flag-draped coffin drove around the stadium, and at times festive as they blew vuvuzela horns and sang soccer chants.

Those in attendance at the service - held at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban - included Meyiwa's widow, politicians, footballers, celebrities and members of the general public who wished to pay their respects to the much-loved player.

South Africa has been in mourning for the past week after the popular national team player and captain was shot dead during a botched  robbery at his girlfriend's home last Sunday.

His coffin was today carried into the stadium by his  team-mates and across the pitch by members of the South African Police as the memorial service got underway.

'We've got every reason to be angry about Senzo,' Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula told the mourners. 'Justice is grinding and we will find them. We will never rest until we find all of them.'

Kaizer Motaung, the founder of the Kaizer Chiefs, the main rivals to the Orlando Pirates club Meyiwa played for said: 'Lest we forget, this is not the first time that an icon of this nature departs in the fashion that Senzo departed.'

Thousands of people braved drizzling rain in the 85,000 seater stadium, a short distance from the Umhlazi township where Meyiwa was born.

Most of the crowd wore the Pirates' red or black colours but there was also a sprinkling of the yellow worn by the Chiefs.

Team mates and mourners wiped away tears as they watched video clips showing father of three Meyiwa training, diving to make saves, or pumping his arms in celebration of a win.

Meyiwa had captained South Africa in their first four African Nations Cup qualifiers over the last two months without conceding a goal. 

The funeral comes the day after it was announced a suspect has been arrested and charged with murder for his shooting.

Police said the suspect, 25-year-old Zenokuhle Mbatha, will be held in custody until his next court appearance on November 11.

Police said Mbatha was placed in a lineup and 'positively identified' by witnesses to the killing of Meyiwa, who was shot in the upper body during the attempted house robbery on Sunday night while visiting his girlfriend.

The suspect also faces a charge of armed robbery, said Nathi Mncube, spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority.

Police said they are hunting two more suspects and investigations are at a 'very sensitive stage.'

Meyiwa, a goalkeeper for South Africa and club team Orlando Pirates, was fatally shot in the township of Vosloorus near Johannesburg.

Meyiwa was gunned down by an intruder at his girlfriend's home in south-east Johannesburg last Sunday

The death of the popular player and national team captain led to an outpouring of dismay and anger in South Africa, which has a high murder rate. 

South Africa remains one of the world's most violent countries, although the murder rate been dropping gradually. Police recorded more than 17,000 murders last year, or 31 per 100,000 people - seven times the rate in the United States.

An average 50 guns are reported lost and stolen every day from licensed owners, according to lobby group Gun Free South Africa.

Authorities said three suspects were involved in the break-in that led to Meyiwa's death. Police launched a manhunt and offered a reward of nearly $23,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of 27-year-old Meyiwa's killers.

Police said: 'Whilst we are pleased with the progress we are making and the overwhelming support from members of the public, there is still a lot of work to be done to finalize the investigation and ensure that we can link all suspects to the murder.'

South African officials on Thursday called for a strict new gun law as a tribute to Meyiwa. The calls were made at a memorial service to honor Meyiwa and two other South African sports figures, who all died in the space of a few days.

Former 800-meter world champion runner and Olympic silver medalist Mbulaeni Mulaudzi was killed in a car crash on Friday, and female boxer Phindile Mwelase died Saturday after being in a coma following a bout.

Meyiwa's death also came days after the jailing of paralympian Oscar Pistorius for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp thinking she was an intruder lurking in his luxury Pretoria home in the capital of crime-ridden South Africa.
