'Narcissist': Serial killer Dennis Nilsen is serving life for murdering six people including Billy Sutherland

The brother of one of the victims of Britain’s notorious serial killer Dennis Nilsen last night called for action to stop the murderer’s memoirs being published on the internet.

The Mail on Sunday revealed last week how excerpts written by Nilsen, a former civil servant and police officer who is serving life for butchering six young men and trying to kill two others in the late 1970s and early 80s, had begun appearing on the web in defiance of a government ban.

Now Seaton Sutherland, whose oldest brother Billy died at the hands of Nilsen, has broken 30 years of silence to express the family’s shock at the ease with which sections of the self-serving and ‘pornographic’ autobiography have been posted on two internet sites.

The shock move comes despite the authorities, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett and the European Court of Human Rights, repeatedly banning publication, claiming the lurid details of the killings would be distressing to the victims’ families.

Last night, Mr Sutherland, 47, from Edinburgh, said: ‘This man is a monster and he should not be allowed a voice. This is attempting to glorify what he did, and it was the right decision to stop his autobiography ever being published.

‘It is disgraceful that reputable sites are being used to get round the ban and someone should do something to pull the plug on this before it goes any further. Gag the monster before it’s too late and before more damage is done.’

Chapters posted over the past 10 days include material about Nilsen’s early life and his dead grandfather - which is used to justify his later crimes. Postings suggest further material is due to be placed online over coming weeks.

It is known that copies of the autobiography were taken out of prison, but it is not clear who is responsible for putting the material on the internet - or whether they are acting on the instructions of the killer. Nilsen is denied access to the internet at Full Sutton maximum security prison near York.

Mr Sutherland added: ‘What has appeared so far is disgusting. Why is action not being taken to stop this now?

‘Take it down for the sake of the families who are still having to deal with what he did. It wasn’t just our loved ones he killed. Something died inside my parents and my brothers and sisters. He ruined our family. We’ve never had anywhere to go to grieve for Billy because of what Nilsen did to him and the horror of how he died and what happened to him afterwards never leaves us.’

In 1996 Nilsen wrote his life story, Nilsen: History Of A Drowning Man. A copy was taken out of jail by his then solicitor, but publication was vetoed and the manuscript was not returned.

Tragic: William Sutherland vanished aged 26 when he left Edinburgh to find work in London

Nilsen went to the European Court of Human Rights two years ago claiming his writings ‘stimulated much academic and medical debate’ but the case was dismissed.

Nilsen, 67, who grew up in Fraserburgh, 
Aberdeenshire, worked as an Army cook for 11 years before joining the 
Metropolitan Police for eight months and later the civil service.

Between 1978 and 1983, he killed at least 15 men and boys but claimed he
could not remember the names of nine.

All his victims were students or mostly homeless men whom he took to his house either for sex or just for company. Once there, they were strangled or drowned.

Eventually, he would dismember them and hide the remains, storing these under floorboards or in bin bags stuffed into a wardrobe.

Unsuspecting Billy Sutherland, 26, a divorcee with a girlfriend and three-year-old son, left his home in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, for London in August 1980 to find a job but mysteriously ‘vanished’ within days of arriving in the capital. He had worked as a chef in London previously and hoped to find something similar when he visited the job centre where Nilsen worked. Hearing his Scottish accent, the killer suggested they to go for a drink.

Billy would become Nilsen’s fourth victim that night but it was another three years before his family discovered he was dead. They reported his disappearance in 1980 to police in London and he remained a ‘missing person’ until Nilsen’s killing spree was uncovered in 1983.

What has appeared so far is disgusting. Why is action not being taken to stop this now?

Mr Sutherland said: ‘My mum was watching the news on TV. They were digging up Nilsen’s garden, looking for bodies. There was a knock at the door and it was detectives to say they had found parts of Billy under Nilsen’s floorboards. There was a piece of skin with a tattoo on it and his false teeth, which forensics used to confirm his identity. The whole family were in shock.’

In 1983, Nilsen was found guilty of six murders – including Billy’s - and two attempted murders. The Home Office has said Nilsen will never be released.

Mr Sutherland added: ‘A memorial service was held for Billy but my dad, a proud marine engineer, couldn’t face going back to his job and my mum developed depression.

Her only hope was when she died she would see Billy again.

She also hoped to see Nilsen die in prison but that never happened. My parents are dead now and I can never forgive Nilsen for the misery he put them both through.’

It was not just the circumstances of Billy’s death, however, which tortured his family but the casual – and, they believe, untrue – comment to police by Nilsen after his arrest that the Scot had been a male prostitute.

Genuine: Professor David Wilson, who met Nilsen, said the posts appear to 'genuinely the work of the serial killer'

It is a description which has remained for 33 years and one his siblings can never accept.

Mr Sutherland said: ‘One of our brothers is actually gay and laughed at the idea of Billy being homosexual. He was the biggest womaniser going. He had been married and gone on to have a son with another girlfriend. Knowing Billy, he probably thought Nilsen was being friendly towards him because they were both Scots.

‘I hate the fact every time I search on the internet for “Billy Sutherland” – which is also the name of my son – that a picture of my brother comes up with the words “male prostitute” next to a photograph of Nilsen.’

He added: ‘I’m angry that’s how my brother’s remembered and I’m angry Nilsen’s book is being published. This has to stop now. We’re not dealing with fiction here – real lives have been destroyed because of this man’s heinous crimes.’
