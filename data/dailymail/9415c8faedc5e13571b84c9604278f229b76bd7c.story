The teenager eventually tweeted an apology, ‘I would never say something so awful I apologize to everyone who has been affended (sic)’ and her Twitter and Facebook accounts have since been made private

Oakwood High School was then forced to issue a statement stressing that the girl was expressing her personal opinion and didn't reflect the opinion of her school.

‘We assure anyone who read those comments that they do not reflect any of the teachings of this school district, nor are they indicative of the beliefs of the staff, administration or Board of Education,’ said Oakwood City School District.

The board didn't comment on if the student would be punished.
