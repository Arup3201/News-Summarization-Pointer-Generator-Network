The wife of Jerry Sandusky defended her husband on the stand during the sixth day of his child sex abuse trial, saying that she remembers most of his accusers, and never witnessed them having sexual contact with the ex-Penn State football coach.

Dottie Sandusky, who has stood by her husband - including posting his bail - told jurors on Tuesday that she never saw anything inappropriate between her husband and the boys.

When asked by lead prosecutor Joe McGettigan why the men might lie in making the accusations, she said: 'I don't know what it would be for,' while shaking of her head.

She said one of accusers, dubbed Victim 10 in court records, she did not know at all.

She described Victim 1 as 'clingy,' Victim 9 as 'a charmer' and Victim 4 as 'very conniving, and he wanted his way and he didn't listen a whole lot.'

Victim 9 testified last week that he was attacked by Jerry Sandusky in the basement of their home and cried out for help while Dottie Sandusky was upstairs - but she never responded.

She said the basement was not soundproof and she would have been able to hear shouting if she were upstairs.

Jerry and Dottie Sandusky were married in 1966, and have no biological children together. They adopted six times and were also foster parents.

Dottie Sandusky, who isn't charged in the case, also said the visiting boys were free to sleep upstairs if they wanted to.

The accusers have said Jerry Sandusky directed them to the basement, where they allege he sometimes molested them on a waterbed that was in the room.

Also Tuesday, a psychologist testifying for the defence in the Jerry Sandusky trial says the former coach has a personality disorder characterised by excessive emotionality and attention-seeking.

Elliot Atkins said that he interviewed Sandusky for six hours before diagnosing the ex-coach with 'histrionic personality disorder.'

Atkins explained to the court that people with the disorder often interact with others in inappropriately seductive ways and don't feel comfortable unless they're the center of attention.

Sandusky's attorney Joe Amendola is hoping to convince jurors that the disorder could explain his client's letters and other interaction that prosecutors allege shows his grooming of victims.

'Based on my evaluation of Mr. Sandusky, I have diagnosed a histrionic personality disorder,' said Atkins.

The psychologist's testimony followed attempts
by defence lawyers earlier in the day to discredit the prosecution's 
case by suggesting investigators had coached testimony from one of the 
Sandusky's alleged victims.

Sandusky
faces 51 counts of child molestation after the prosecution dropped one 
charge of unlawful contact with minors on Monday.

If convicted on all 
counts, the former defensive coordinator for Pennsylvania State 
University's successful football program faces a sentence of more than 
500 years in prison.

The case has 
focused renewed national attention on the issue of child sexual abuse 
and prompted the firing in November of Penn State President Graham 
Spanier and legendary head football coach Joe Paterno.

Paterno died of 
lung cancer in January.

The former defensive coordinator for the Penn State University football team, Sandusky, 68, denies all 51 counts of committing abuse.

Atkins told the court that Sandusky's histrionic personality disorder definitely explained his grooming behaviour.

He told the court that he spent six hours with the accused, read the personal emails he sent to some of the alleged victims and also read his autobiography, 'Touched.'

In the case of Sandusky, Atkins outlined
that histrionic means 'dramatic' or 'theatrical' and that people with 
the disorder need the approval of other people and act up and create 
unusual situations to make sure they are the centre of attention.

Atkins confirmed that people with this mental condition, 'might do something dramatic to draw attention to themselves.'

This would include acting in a way that is 'inappropriately sexually provocative.'

The defence move to highlight Sandusky's mental fragility comes after a string of prosecution witnesses, including eight alleged victims, testified that he groomed them and abused them while they were with his Second Mile charity for troubled children.

The eight alleged victims, now men aged 18 to 28, 
testified for the prosecution last week, describing in often graphic 
detail being molested by Sandusky as boys, including oral and anal sex 
and shared showers.

Two other alleged victims have never been 
identified.

Many have criticised the use of this defence.

'This would be an incredible stretch - so much that it disturbs some of my colleagues that they are bringing it up,' said Gail Saltz, an an associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine to MSNBC.

'This diagnosis has no bearing on your moral compass, your ability to understand what's legal,' she said.

'It has nothing to do with being a pedophile. It has nothing to do with sexual behavior toward children.'

Earlier in the day, defense lawyers took aim 
at law enforcement officers' testimony that they had not discussed abuse
accounts offered by fellow accusers with other alleged victims in the 
closely watched case.

Amendola 
questioned Pennsylvania state trooper Corporal Scott Rossman and retired
trooper Joseph Leiter about a taped interview they held with one of the
accusers, known in court documents as Victim 4, and his attorney in 
April 2011.

The interview was 
played in court and Leiter was heard saying to Victim 4 during a break 
that investigators had interviewed about nine other potential victims.

In some cases 'oral sex has taken place by both parties,' which would be
considered rape under state law, he said.

Leiter
could be heard saying telling the accuser that his story 'word for 
word' followed those of others.

'He has taken advantage of you. We need 
you to tell us what happened,' Leiter is heard saying.

Under
cross examination by a prosecutor, Leiter said he considered the 
interview technique to be appropriate and never suggested to a victim 
what he should say.

It was the 
second day of the defense case after the prosecution rested its case on 
Monday.

Judge John Cleland told jurors on Monday he expected closing 
arguments to take place on Thursday.

Two
university officials also face charges of perjury and failure to report
suspected abuse in an alleged incident involving Sandusky and a boy at a
Penn State locker room.

Earlier Tuesday, defense attorney Joe Amendola  told reporters to 'stay tuned' to find out if Sandusky would take the stand himself, comparing the case to a soap opera. 

Asked which soap opera, defense attorney Joe Amendola initially said 'General Hospital,' then 'All My Children.'

These dramatic developments came on the same day that TMZ released an unaired clip from the November telephone interview between Sandusky and Bob Costas during 'Rock Center with Brian Williams'.

Speaking about the attention which he paid to the young boys under his care, Sandusky stopped short of denying that he ever sexually abused young children.

'I didn't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that I've helped.'

NBC was criticised for not playing the clip back in November, but 'NBC Nightly News' hit back saying, 'There were a lot of compelling comments in the original interview but we did not have time to include them all.'

Sandusky is charged with 51 counts involving 10 boys. He denies the allegations.
