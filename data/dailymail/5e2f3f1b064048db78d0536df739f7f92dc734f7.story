The Duchess of Cambridge chatted about Prince George, the new royal baby and did a turn on a ukulele during a private visit to a children's hospice yesterday.

She was visiting the Bethlem and Maudsley Hospital School in south London and followed up the engagement, which was not publicised in advance, with a reception  this morning.

The reception, which was also a private engagement, was to discuss the Royal Foundation's support for hospices offering palliative care for young children.

Having fun: Kate, who visited a school yesterday, with a little boy during a visit to the Scouts in January

Kate has long been a supporter of children's wellbeing initiatives and is patron of East Anglia Children's Hospices (EACH).

Her visit to an EACH launch in Norfolk last autumn saw her meet parents and terminally ill children, with the Duchess welling up after being told mother Leigh Smith's heartbreaking story.

The Duchess, who is around six and a half months pregnant, has been working in private since returning from a two week break in Mustique with Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge and her family on Friday.

First on her agenda was the visit to Bethlem and Maudsley School which educates children with long term illnesses who are being treated at the nearby Bethlem Royal and Maudsley Hospitals.

Speaking after the visit, headteacher Dr John Ivens revealed that, along with managing to keep up during a ukulele lesson, the Duchess proved herself a good listener.

'One of the boys managed to teach the Duchess a couple of chords on the ukulele,' revealed Dr Ivens. 'She kept up with them.'

What a gentleman the Duke of Cambridge is. Whilst we can't quite see what the Duchess is wearing to fly home from their annual holiday on the island of Mustique, luckily we can get a load of the couples' luggage!

Jokingly, he quipped: 'There’s a career there.' 

'The Duchess is very good at listening to what people are saying to her, especially children, and responding in a thoughtful way,' added Dr Ivens.

'Clearly it was very important for her to understand how young people get to a situation that they need to be an in-patient at such a young age.

'It was clear that her intention in coming was to find out more about this area. She talked a little bit about that with the children and about what George likes. It was lovely.'

Dr Ivens, an educational psychologist, is also involved with another of the Duchess' charities, children's mental health organisation, Place2Be.

Although not part of the group who attended a reception at Kensington Palace in November, Dr Ivens did speak at a Place2Be conference, which the Duchess attended, in June.

Welfare: A day earlier, she had visited another child welfare charity, The Art Room 

Mental health: In November, Kate hosted a reception for children's mental welbeing charity, Place2Be

Proficient: The Duchess proved herself adept at playing the ukulele during yesterday's visit

While today's visit was noticeably light on the ukuleles, the reception saw the Duchess speak to some of the people involved with the Royal Foundation's child wellbeing programme.

The Foundation, which is a vehicle for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry's philanthropic work, holds regular catch-up meetings between the royals and charity representatives to catch up  

The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry is the main vehicle for the three royals’ philanthropic activities and they each hold catch up meetings to overview its work and speak to those involved.

A Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'It was a standard meeting of the Foundation. They were mainly focusing on palliative care issues.'

Tomorrow, the Duchess will be back in front of the cameras when she heads to Portsmouth to meet Olympic sailing champion Sir Ben Ainslie and see the work of his 1851 Trust.

It will be her first public engagement since January 19th, when she carried out a series of visits in London and revealed that while she doesn't know the sex of her baby, she can feel it kicking while  on official royal duties. 

Big plans: She will visit Sir Ben Ainslie  tomorrow, seen here at the launch of the UK bid for the America's Cup

Visit: The trip will also see her tour parts of Portsmouth, including the new Spinnaker Tower
