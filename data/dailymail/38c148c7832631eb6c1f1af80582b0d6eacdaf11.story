With her designer dresses and high heels, she looks every inch the accomplished socialite.

But MailOnline can reveal that Jill Kelley was taunted over her large nose in high school - and vowed to get plastic surgery to make it look better – and perhaps the episode points to an inner frailty about her looks that drove her determination to have a string of powerful men in her thrall.

The woman who is at the center of the scandal that has felled two top generals told fellow pupils when she and her twin sister Natalie were 18, that they were ‘going to get a nose job and when we you do you’ll all be in awe of us’.

Then and now: In her teens, Jill Kelley allegedly was defensive of her nose saying she would get plastic surgery

She was also ‘flirtatious’, gave boys 
she met a big grin and used to wear tight blue jeans which brought many 
an admiring male gaze.

It is not clear if Mrs Kelley followed through on her promise to get plastic surgery.

The claims show that Mrs Kelley’s interest in carefully crafting her image started at an early age.

Since
the scandal broke she has appeared in public ‘looking a million 
dollars’, notably in a bright yellow dress and three inch heels as she 
climbed into her Mercedes outside her mansion in Tampa, Florida 
yesterday and today in a polished pink and gold heels ensemble.

Judging by pictures in her high school yearbook, she was glamorous and well aware of her charms even at a young age.

In her official 1993 graduation photo for Lower Moreland High School in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania she posed wearing a black dress and pearls around her neck with her jet black hair tumbling over her left shoulder.

Mrs Kelley, 37, has become the central
figure in the scandal which has caused General David Petraeus, 60, to 
step down as head of the CIA and forced General John Allen to stand down
from his post leading US troops in Afghanistan.

General Allen, who is married, sent her between 20,000 to 30,000 e-mail messages, some of which were of an inappropriate nature.

General Petraeus’ mistress, Paula 
Broadwell, an Army reservist who was also his biographer, is said to 
have emailed Mrs Kelley and warned her to back off because she was 
jealous, which led to the affair becoming public when the FBI got 
involved.

Mrs Kelley’s former high school friend
told MailOnline that in her youth she was ‘studious’ and would help 
others out with their maths studies if they asked her.

The friend said: ‘She and her sister were joined at the hip, we hardly ever saw them apart so we called them ‘The Twins’.

‘They joined in year 11 so there was 
just one year before we went to college, and they didn’t have much time 
to make lots of friends. I’m not sure they even went to the prom and I 
don’t think they went to any of the parties that happened.

‘I’m stunned they are involved in all 
this. I guess some people get their partying out of the way when they 
are younger - they were pretty quiet at school so I guess it’s all 
coming out now’.

The friend added that both Mrs Kelley and her sister ‘used to get teased about their noses’.

The friend said: ‘People used to say things. It did come out and it was quite pronounced and thick.

‘I remember her making a comment, it 
was something like: ‘We are going to get a nose job and when we you do 
you’ll all be in awe of us. I was like: ‘Errr, ok’.

‘Jill was flirtatious. She didn’t touch you or anything but she would look you in the eye and smile.

‘She would wear shorts in the summer 
and she and her sister would wear matching jeans that were usually 
pretty tight. She looked good.

‘She didn’t date anyone to my knowledge while she was at Lower Moreland.

MailOnline can also reveal that Mrs 
Kelley might have had access to ‘influential figures in the global area’
even before she left high school.

She was a student member of the World 
Affairs Council and would have been given the opportunity to meet 
dignitaries at the highest level including presidents, prime ministers 
and princes.

According to the Philadelphia branch 
of the nationwide non-profit organisation, it was founded in 1949 to 
inform people of all ages ‘on matters of national and international 
significance’.

Among the guest speakers in the past 
have been Prince Albert of Monaco, Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan, 
George H W Bush, George W Bush and Tony Blair.

Its website says: ‘The Council 
provides its members and the greater Philadelphia community with access 
to influential figures in the global area as well as opportunities to 
visit fascinating destinations through its unique travel program.’

Petraeus also made an appearance, but it was in 2010 and long after she had left school.

Mrs Kelley - who appears in the 
yearbook under her maiden name Khawam - was a ‘Mathlete’ and would have 
competed against other schools in maths competitions.

She claims to have written for student
newspaper Lion’s Roar which allowed students to ‘freely vent their 
creative juices’, the yearbook says.

The newspaper also started up a world 
news section because, according to its 1993 editor Sharon Herring, there
was concern students were ‘lacking in their knowledge of the outside 
world’.

Another string to Mrs Kelley’s bow was
the Future Business Leaders of America whose members took part in 
competitions where they learned skills that would be useful at work, 
such as typing and accounting.

In the yearbook Stephanie Simon said: 
‘I believe that FBLA not only exposes students to the important field of
business, but it also aides the community.

‘Students are able to get a taste of the real world in more ways than one’

Mrs Kelley also appears to have had a 
strong moral compass and was a member of SADD - Students Against Drunk 
Driving - another group called Students For a More Conscious Society, 
the student council, a community outreach program called Operation Smile
and the Red Cross

Her other activities were computer 
club, science club, orchestra basketball, cross country running, field 
hockey, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field and orchestra.

Mrs Kelley grew up in Philadelphia with her family, who emigrated there from Lebanon in the 1970s.

Her parents, John and Marcelle Khawam, once ran a Middle Eastern restaurant and now live in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania.

In her yearbook entry, Mrs Kelley’s twin sister Natalie Kwaham wears the same clothes as her sister and is also smiling.

Her activities included concert choir, the World Affairs Council and Students For A More Conscious Society.

The sisters moved to Tampa, Florida around ten years ago where they both became regulars on the social circuit.

Mrs Kelley’s husband Scott works as a 
surgeon, while Natalie Khawam is a lawyer who specialises in dealing 
with whistleblowers, which has newfound irony considering Jill was the 
one whose contact with the FBI led to the resignation of a 
well-respected general and the investigation into another.

A friend, who has known Kelley for 
almost a decade, said that the revelation that Mrs Kelley exchanged 
between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of communications with General John 
Allen comes as a surprise.

'This has come as a complete shock. 
You never know what goes on behind closed doors, but no one in her 
circle saw this coming,' the friend told MailOnline.

'Jill was well known for throwing 
parties where the military attended and she reveled in her role as 
honorary ambassador but sending all those emails to a general is another
thing.'

Her brother, David Khawam, has also revealed their fear that she will be branded the 'other woman'.

Speaking to the Today show, he said: 'This is something that is going to brand her for life.

'My sister, number one, is a mother. She has three kids and is extremely dedicated to those kids.

'Number two she is a wife. She is 
extremely dedicated to her husband and he to her. For her to have an 
affair with General Petraeus is ludicrous.

Mrs Kelley regularly kept in touch 
with then-Gen. Petraeus when he became commander of the Afghan war 
effort, the two exchanging near-daily emails and instant messages, two 
of his former staffers say.

But those messages were exchanged in 
accounts that his aides monitored as part of their duties and were not 
romantic in tone, the staffers said.

Mr Khawam added that he expected his 
sister, who has hired the crisis management firm employed by Monica 
Lewinsky and the attorney who represented John Edwards earlier this 
year, to address reports about her involvement with two of the top US 
military chiefs.
