Liverpool are making a surprise U-turn after enquiring about taking Mario Balotelli on loan.

Brendan Rodgers had said Liverpool would categorically not be signing the errant Italy striker last month, but has had a change of heart.

Rodgers is now exploring the possibility of bringing the 24-year-old to Anfield after growing frustrated in the pursuit of other targets.

Milan would prefer a permanent deal and that could yet prove an obstacle as Liverpool understandably have concerns about his behaviour.

Balotelli has been involved in a series of scrapes during his career to date, especially during his time in the Premier League.

On the field, he was sent off for Manchester City against Arsenal in 2012 in a defeat that almost derailed their title charge.

And off the pitch, there was the notorious incident when Balotelli set off fireworks in his house, leading to him revealing the famous 'Why Always Me?' T-shirt when he scored in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford in 2011.

His agent Mino Raiola has flown to England to ascertain what Liverpool want to do and see if other English clubs are interested.  

Since returning to Italy, he has scored 30 goals in 54 games, the same amount he scored for City in 80 games. 

And it is easy to forget that he has already won four titles in two countries, a Champions League and the FA Cup and Coppa Italia by the age of 24.
