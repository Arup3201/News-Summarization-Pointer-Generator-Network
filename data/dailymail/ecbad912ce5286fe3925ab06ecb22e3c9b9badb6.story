Liverpool fans will have the perfect opportunity on Thursday night to see if World Cup teenager Divock Origi really is the answer to all their problems at Anfield.

With Luis Suarez gone, Daniel Sturridge injured and Mario Balotelli struggling badly, it is ironic that their £10million striker Origi will be in action against Everton in the Europa League for his loan club Lille.

A goal or two will undoubtedly lead to calls from the Kop that he is brought back from France straight away to ease the Reds out of a mini-crisis following an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat against Real Madrid.

Brendan Rodgers swooped for the 19-year-old after he starred for Belgium last summer but agreed to immediately send him back to Lille on a season-long loan to aid his development.

Officially, that is still written in stone though when a club as powerful as Liverpool are paying out millions of pounds, they usually find a way if they wanted Origi back earlier, possibly in January.

Former Anfield striker Michael Owen thinks they should but Everton manager Roberto Martinez, whose side have the task of stopping Origi tonight, advises caution about rushing the 19-year-old into the Premier League.

Roberto Martinez's Everton will look to limit Origi's influence for Lille in their Europa League meeting 

'You need to think about what the best step is to get a player ready for the Premier League. Sometimes as a young player you need to play games and you need to play minutes,' said the Everton boss.

'Remember that Origi didn't have many starts last season. He was more coming on as substitute, and slowly in the second half of the season he had a bigger role. So maybe he needed more starts before coming over. That is a strategy that has been put in place.

'I don't know the details surrounding the loan, but for me it's not strange.'

You can see Martinez's point of view. Liverpool's current predicament is borne out a perfect storm of losing Sturridge for two months with thigh and calf injures and the disastrous form of Balotelli and another summer signing Rickie Lambert.

That doesn't mean Origi is the answer either at this moment. He had an explosive World Cup where his pace and movement shocked defenders. 

But towards the end of the tournament he was less effective, and has spoken himself of missing seven or eight chances against Tim Howard when Belgium played USA. 

Howard of course will be in Everton's goal against him tonight. This season, Origi has scored five goals to underline his potential, four for Lille and once for his country.

And yet his overall form has blown hot and cold. He is inconsistent – something Liverpool don't need. 

Having said all that, if Origi does well against Everton, it may look odd to keep him in France while his parent club are struggling in front of goal. Martinez, who has an encyclopedic knowledge of world football and was in Brazil as a television summariser last summer, knows Origi's qualities. 

'The World Cup showed he is intelligent and has a real strong personality. He has got real pace and power, a striker that can play really well in wide areas and a real threat on the counter attack. 

'When he faces space he can be really dangerous. Origi can finish with both feet but is probably more right footed. I think he is someone that needs to be facing the space to be at his very best.' 

Liverpool fans don't have to take Martinez's words for it. They will be able to see Origi with their own eyes against their Merseyside rivals and whatever happens it's unlikely he'll be swapping shirts with an Everton player at half-time.
