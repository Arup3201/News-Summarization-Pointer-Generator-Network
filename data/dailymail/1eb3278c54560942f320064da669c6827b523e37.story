The family of a 17-year-old found dead in a high school gym mat have called for investigators to reopen his case after a second autopsy found that his death resulted from non-accidental blunt-force trauma.

The independent report, which was released by experts hired by Kendrick Johnson's family who had their son's body exhumed, directly contradicts the results of an autopsy performed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which named positional asphyxia as the cause of death.

Lowndes County Sheriff's Office ruled the 17-year-old's death an accident, saying that the Lowndes high School student became lodged inside a rolled-up mat after falling in while reaching for a shoe.

However, the family has a number of questions around the death particularly related to a group of students who were recorded on security cameras heading into the gym moments after their son.

Life cut short: Kendrick Johnson, 17, was found dead in January inside the school gym after going missing a day earlier.

His body was discovered on the morning
of January 11 in the high school's gym after his parents reported him 
missing the night before. 

Now, attorney
Chevene King, who represents the boy's family, has sent the new autopsy
report cited by CNN to the U.S. Department of Justice-Civil Rights Division, the 
GBI, the U.S. Attorney for Georgia’s Middle District and the Lowndes 
County Coroner for review.

The
next step in the case would be to call a coroner's inquest to decide 
the cause of death in a process resembling a grand jury.

After
noticing inconsistencies in the first autopsy report, the Johnson 
family asked a judge for permission to exhume their son's body and 
conduct another autopsy - a request that was granted in May.

Kendrick's
body was scrutinized June 15 by the Florida-based forensic expert Dr 
William Anderson, who concluded that the teenager died from blunt force 
trauma to the right neck and soft tissues near the carotid artery, 'consistent with inflicted 
injury.'

King said the findings appear consistent with a possible assault.

The results of the
independent autopsy appear to dovetail with the report written by EMTs 
who first examined Kendrick’s' body on January 11, 2013, which indicated
that they observed 'bruising' to the right side jaw.

Evidence: This sneaker was discovered next to the teen's body in the gym. It has been suggested that he fell into the mat while reaching for it

Inconsistencies: Kendrick's parents insist that their son, whose shoulders were 19 inches across, could not have even fit into the opening of the rolled-up mat

The
first responders' findings, however, were later refuted by subsequent 
reports filed by the crime lab that handled the case and the GBI's 
autopsy, which cited no significant injuries.

A
spokesperson for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said the agency 
stands by its report after reviewing the findings of the independent 
autopsy.

King said Johnson's family doesn't expect neither the GBI nor the sheriff’s office to take an objective second look at the case.

Kendrick Johnson's parents have always questioned the official version of what happened to their son on the day of January 10, 2012, rejecting the idea that the athletic boy accidentally suffocated after being lodged in a rolled-up mat while retrieving a shoe. 

The parents suggested that their son, who was 5-foot-10, would not have tried to reach all the way down into a mat to grab his sneakers since the mat was about 6 feet tall and there was no way his arms could reach the bottom.

Another key factor is the width of the opening of the rolled-up mat measuring 14-and-a-half inches across. The parents claim Kendrick, whose shoulders measured 19 inches across, would not have even fit into the opening.

Also, a question has been raised as to why none of the people who visited the gym that day spotted Johnson’s legs sticking out of the mat, which would have been the case had he fallen in with his arms stretched out.

It is likely the boy would not have lost consciousness at once, leading those skeptical of the investigators' version of events to wonder: why didn't Kendrick scream for help, and if he did, why none of the students who came to the gym to play basketball heard his voice? 

The sneakers, which are at the heart of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s theory, present another problem. If Kendrick fell while reaching to retrieve his shoes from the bottom of the mat, why did they end up lodged between his lower body and the inside of the mat, as if they fell in after him?

Droplets of blood, which did not belong to Kendrick, were found on a wall not far from the teen's body, but according to the Johnsons, no effort has been made to determine whose it was and how it got there.

Perhaps the biggest gap of all in the story is the mystery video showing Kendrick walking into the gym on the day of his death, followed by several other students. The sheriff's department has not released the footage, citing the fact that it depicts minors.

‘We have really no recourse but to see whether or not the Justice Department or U.S. attorney's office would come in and reopen the investigation,’ King said.

The sheriff and his detectives spent nearly four months investigating Johnson's death before closing the case in early May.

From the very beginning, Johnson's father, Kenneth, has been claiming that his son was murdered.

'I want to express how did my son go missing during school hours in broad
daylight?

'We know our son was murdered while he was at Lowndes High 
School. We do know that,' he told a local television station in January.

The teen's aunt, Anastasia Roe, said her nephew was a good student but ran into problems with another student last year, FoxNews.com reported.

But the GBI autopsy found no signs of a struggle, officials said.

It has been suggested by investigators that Johnson may have been reaching for a shoe that had fallen into the mat.

A shoe was found at the scene, but it is not known whether it belonged to Kendrick.

'We feel like he was trying to reach a shoe that was down that hole,' the sheriff told the Valdosta Daily Times, adding that no one knows for sure why he reached into the mat 'but him and the good Lord.'

Kendrick Johnson, a 5-foot-10, 
160-pound multi-talented athlete, attended classes on the morning of 
January 10, 2012. Just after 1pm, he entered the gym, never to come out 
alive.

Some 8 hours 
later, his mother, Jackie Johnson, started to worry that her son did 
failed to make it home, Grantland.com reported. At around 11pm, she drove to and from school 
looking for her son.

After
midnight, the mother called 911 to report him missing, and was told by a
dispatcher that he was probably 'just out with some fast-tailed girl.'

But
Mrs Johnson knew that her son always called if he was planning to stay 
out late. At around 4am, she called police again and prayed through the 
night.

At around 
8.30am the following morning, Jackie drove to school to ask around about
her son. She was sitting in a guidance counselor office when she heard 
the fateful words on the phone: 'the found a body in the gym.'

According
to the sheriff’s department, a school security camera captured the teen
entering the gym at 1.09pm. What happened next remains unclear.

Lingering questions: Kendrick's parents have questioned the official autopsy report, suspecting that their son was murdered

Second try: The Johnson family asked for and received permission to exhume their son's body for another autopsy in June

Harrowing discovery: The teen's body was found in the old gym at Lowndes High School in the south Georgia town of Valdosta

There was a gym class afterward and basketball practice in the gym that evening. Nobody found Johnson's body until the next morning.

The sheriff told The Valdosta Daily Times on May 3 that students who didn't have lockers kept personal belongings such as gym shoes on top of rolled-up wrestling mats left propped up behind the gym bleachers.

Investigators found some of Johnson's books and one tennis shoe near the body and believe they tumbled from atop the mat when a gym coach frantically pulled it over trying to free Johnson after students spotted his feet.

‘We did everything we knew to do, and this is a tragic accident,’ Prine told the newspaper in May. ‘But that's all it was - an accident.’
