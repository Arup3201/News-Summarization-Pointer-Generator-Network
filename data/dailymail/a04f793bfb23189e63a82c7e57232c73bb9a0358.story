A 102-year-old letter found in a couple’s attic has revealed that  Titanic was nearly stopped from beginning its doomed voyage.

The letter, which sold for £24,000  at an auction this afternoon, reveals that the large wake caused by Titanic leaving Southampton snapped the mooring ropes of two ships, New York and Oceanic.

Titanic was seconds away from hitting New York - but changed direction just in time.

If the crash had happened it would have without doubt changed the course of history, auctioneers have said.

A 102-year-old letter from the chief engineer of Titanic to his son has revealed that the ship almost collided with two other vessels as it left Southampton to begin its doomed voyage

Titanic chief engineer Joseph Bell, pictured on his wedding day with his wife, Maud, sent the letter, which shows that Titanic was seconds away from hitting another ship, potentially changing the course of history

The letter, written by chief engineer Joseph Bell to his son Frank, said: ‘We have made a good run from Southampton, everything is working A1.

‘We nearly had a collision with New York and Oceanic when leaving Southampton. The wash of our propellers made the two ships range about when we were passing them, this made their mooring ropes break and the New York set off across the river until the tugs got hold of her again.

‘No damage was done but it looked like trouble at the time. Keep well and be a good lad.

‘Regards to Mrs Johnston. Your loving father, J. Bell.’

Mr Bell posted the letter from Queenstown - now Cobh - in Ireland on April 11, 1912.

Three days later, Titanic, described as ‘practically unsinkable’, hit an iceberg and sank.

It killed more than 1,500 people including Mr Bell, who left behind his wife Maud and four children.

Andrew Aldridge, from Henry Aldridge and Son auctioneers, said: ‘We got a phone call six months ago from a couple in the UK who are distant direct relations to Joseph Bell. They had just discovered this letter, which had been in their attic for decades.

'We have had a great deal of interest from collectors across the world including the UK, United States, China and Russia.

‘The letter is particularly interesting because of who wrote it and the fact it describes the event in detail.

‘Mr Bell also ironically describes everything as “working A1” on board the liner when she left Southampton.

‘The crash would not have been a disaster but would have been bad enough to delay Titanic for a day or two as the structural integrity of the hull would have needed to be checked. Without a doubt it would have changed the course of history.'

A lunch menu for the first-class restaurant on board Titanic is also up for sale at an auction this afternoon

The deck plan was only given to staff and first-class passengers aboard the doomed ship, which sank in 1912

Mr Bell was born on March, 12 1861 in Farlam, Cumbria.

He left Cumbria and went to Newcastle to work as an apprentice engine fitter at Robert Stephenson and Company, a locomotive manufacturing firm.

In 1885, Mr Bell joined shipping company White Star Line. He travelled to New Zealand and New York and served on 18 ships.

He married Maud Bates in 1893 and had four children - Frances, Marjorie Clare, Eileen Maud and Ralph Douglas.

A decade later, the family moved to Belfast and Mr Bell became chief engineer on RMS Olympic, an ocean liner which was also described as ‘unsinkable’. He was transferred to Titanic and oversaw the construction of the ship.

He was 51-years-old when Titanic sank. His gravestone is engraved with ‘no greater love hath man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends’.

Mr Bell’s letter is not the only significant document to be auctioned on Saturday.

A first class luncheon menu from April 12, 1912, a deck plan and a postcard from a maid are also up for sale.

Ms Lurette sent a postcard to her nephew from Titanic when it stopped off at Queenstown, in Ireland

The postcard, which had a picture of the Titanic on one side, the deck plan and the lunch menu were found in Miss Lurette's coat pocket

The three documents were in the pocket of a coat that 59-year-old Eugénie Elise Lurette, a maid, was wearing when she got into Lifeboat 6.

She boarded Titanic at Cherbourg and was travelling with her employers William and Marie Spencer.

A member of crew woke her up after the ship hit the iceberg and she was rescued.

The menu showed that the wealthy passengers feasted on mutton chops, roast beef, Melton Mowbray pie, lamb and mint sauce, ox tongue, tapioca pudding and greengage tart for the Friday afternoon lunch.

Welsh rarebit and Omer Pacha egg were crossed off as they had been taken off the menu for that day. 

Miss Lurette sent the postcard to her nephew from Titanic when it stopped off at Queenstown.

Despite being used to the extravagant and opulent lifestyle of her employers, Elise wrote that the levels of luxury and comfort on the liner were 'unknown to her until this day.'  

The menu and deck plan fetched £60,000 and £23,000, and the postcard sold for £62,000.
