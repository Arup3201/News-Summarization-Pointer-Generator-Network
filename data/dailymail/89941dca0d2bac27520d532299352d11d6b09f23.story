There's more to New Years Eve than Hogmanay and Jools Holland.

Revellers around the globe will be celebrating in a number of weird and wonderful ways - many of which put party poppers and bubbly to shame.

In Siberia and Russia, there is a tradition to dive into a frozen lake, while holding a tree trunk, which is placed under the ice. 

Meanwhile, in Romania farmers try to communicate with their animals on New Years Eve. If they are successful it is believed they will have good luck for the next year.

Over in Burma people splash water on one another to start the new year with a more purified soul and in the Czech Republic, revellers cut an apple in half then inspect its shape to see what the next 356 days hold.

Wearing red underwear in Italy is thought to bring love, prosperity and good luck and in Venice people gather in St Marks square to partake in a mass kissing session. 

That puts us Brits to shame who  see in festivities by holding hands and singing Auld Lang Syne.
