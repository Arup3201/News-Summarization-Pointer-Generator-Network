The first images have emerged showing Sabrina Allen and her kidnapper mother 12 years after they vanished from Texas. 

Sabrina, who is now 17, was rescued in Papalotla, Tlaxcala, near Mexico City, during a secret mission on Tuesday morning and is now back in Texas, where she has yet to be reunited with her father.

A recent photo shows her blonde locks are long gone; her mother, Dara Llorens, started dyeing her hair to elude authorities after she fled with the girl to Mexico during an unsupervised visit in 2002.

Llorens, 44, has also been pictured for the first time in more than a decade - in a mug shot after she was charged with aggravated kidnapping. She is now in the custody of Austin authorities and is being held on a $300,000 bond.

Llorens is believed to have undergone 'extensive plastic surgery' to hide from investigators, her ex-husband Greg Allen said on Wednesday.

Caught: Dara Llorens has been captured 12 years after snatching her daughter, then four, from Texas and fleeing to Mexico. Her ex-husband said she had undergone plastic surgery to elude authorities

The girl's father told reporters on Wednesday that he has yet to be reunited with his daughter. Sabrina is currently in the care of a clinical psychologist.

'She's in pretty bad shape, from my understanding,' he said as he became emotional.

'She's been told I'm a bad guy, that I'm a wife beater,' he said. 'She's just not ready to see me and my family. I hope and pray that's coming soon, and I can't predict it.'

He added that his ex-wife had told their daughter that he didn't want her and that he had committed suicide. The girl had also been told her paternal grandparents were dead, he said.

Safe: The little girl, pictured as a child, was four years old when she was taken. Her mother dyed her blonde hair to escape authorities and moved around with her constantly to avoid being found

Allen had divorced Llorens before she vanished with their daughter - then four years old - during an unsupervised visit in 2002. He has since remarried and has had more children. 

He said that the 12-year search for his daughter had been a roller coaster filled with false leads.

'I was Ahab and the white whale. I was not going to survive,' he said. 'It's a long road. You don't know what the outcome is.' 

The rescue came thanks to an anonymous tip sent last month to Private Investigator Philip Klein, whom Greg Allen hired nine years ago.

After receiving the tip, Klein contacted state and federal authorities to confirm the identities of the woman and girl using facial recognition. After watching them for two weeks, agents swooped in.

Snatched: Llorens allegedly took her daughter into Mexico after she was supposed to hand the child over to the custody of her father. Greg Allen said his ex-wife has apparently had plastic surgery to appear different

Apartment: They were found living in Papalotla, Tlaxcala near Mexico City and captured on Tuesday morning

'She put up quite a good fight,' Klein said of Llorens. 'There were minor injuries to one of the agents.' 

In a video he posted to GoFundMe page on Wednesday, Allen said that Sabrina had been found with her blonde locks dyed brown. Her mother started dyeing her hair after she was kidnapped. 

'She was not in school and her education is reportedly several years behind,' he said. 'She was effectively a prisoner in a two-bedroom apartment.'

Authorities said that Llorens had repeatedly moved around with her daughter, always fearful investigators or Greg Allen would catch up with them.

Still, Sabrina is physically well and has dreams for the future, including becoming a ballerina, authorities said.  

Never giving up: Sabrina's father, Greg Allen (pictured), hired a private investigator to find his daughter and it was a tip sent to this PI last month that ultimately led to the girl's rescue

Emotional: In a video released on Wednesday, Sabrina's father Greg said that his daughter had been told that she didn't want him and that he had committed suicide. They have yet to be reunited

Greg Allen has stayed committed to the search over the past decade and the case has twice featured on 'America's Most Wanted'.

Sabrina had also been listed as missing by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, while her mother was on the FBI's Most Wanted list. 

Llorens allegedly violated a court-ordered child custody agreement and disappeared with the child shortly after taking her on April 19, 2002, during a scheduled weekend visit.

When she was supposed to return the girl two days later, she never did.

The mother and her daughter were tracked down to Mexico City after 14 months but managed to get away from authorities. Pictures taken at the time showed the girl's blonde locks dyed brown.  

Changed: When the girl was spotted, left, in Mexico City 14 months later, her mother had apparently dyed her blonde locks, right, dark brown. An image right shows what the family thought she might look like

Taken: Sabrina Allen, who is now 17, has returned to Texas and is being evaluated, her family said

At the time, they were living under the assumed names Blanca Aurora Fabian Urieb and Adriana Fabian Uribe. They were last seen living there in June 2003.

Last March, Greg Allen vowed never to give up looking for his daughter.

'I want to find her,' Allen told Fox7. 'I want to see her again. She needs to know she has a family that loves her. I can't just give up on her.'
