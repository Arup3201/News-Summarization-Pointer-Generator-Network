Anyone trying to solve the decades-old mystery of Jimmy Hoffa's whereabouts can be sure about one thing - he's not under a driveway in suburban Detroit.

Authorities drilled through concrete and removed soil samples in Roseville, Michigan, on Friday in the latest effort to find the remains of the Teamsters boss, who disappeared in 1975.

They found nothing, and now, tests on the soil have returned with no signs of human remains.

Digging: After the dig on Friday, tests of the soil underneath the Roseville, Michigan, driveway showed no signs of human decomposition

Where in the world? Jimmy Hoffa, pictured in 1966, was last seen at a suburban Detroit restaurant in 1975

Not a burial spot: This driveway in Roseville, Michigan, was the focus of the investigation after a cancer-stricken tipster said Hoffa may have been buried there

The wait: Results of the soil testing at the driveway were revealed on Tuesday afternoon

In a statement released on Tuesday, the Roseville Police Department said: 'After a battery of tests; the samples submitted for examination showed no signs of human decomposition.

'As a result of these tests the Roseville Police Department will be concluding their investigation into the possible interment of a human body upon the property.'

Authorities admitted that they had 
their doubts from the start after receiving a tip from a  cancer-plagued
man who swore he saw a body being buried 35 years ago that 'may have 
been Jimmy.'

Roseville Police Chief James Berlin said on Friday: 'We're not sure if anything is down there. That's what this is all about.'

They drilled the concrete floor of a shed attached to a driveway where a recent radar test revealed a shift in the soil.

Hoffa's body has not been found despite a 
number of searches over the years and the case remains one of the 
biggest mysteries in modern American history.

Investigation: Police officials drilled through the concrete driveway to obtain a soil sample that was tested for signs of human decomposition

Mystery: Rumors have swirled since Hoffa's disappearance that he was entombed in concrete at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, thrown in a Florida swamp or obliterated in a fat-rendering plant

The anonymous tipster reportedly kept
the dark secret for 37 years because he was terrified that the mob, or whoever killed Hoffa, would come after him.

The homeowner, Patricia Szpunar, 72, has lived there since 1988. She said her son uses the 12-by-12 shed to store two workbenches and his motorcycle.

Police detectives appeared more than two weeks ago and said they may need to search her yard for a dead body. 

Szpunar said on Friday: 'I laughed at them. I looked at them and said, `What? Do you think Jimmy Hoffa is buried in my backyard?' ... They just looked at me, and asked why I said Jimmy Hoffa.'

Authorities had already said that they did not believe the timeline added up and that it's unlikely Hoffa's body is there.

He was last seen July 30, 1975, outside a restaurant in Oakland County, more than 30 miles to the west.

Recently retired Detroit FBI chief Andrew Arena was among the doubters.

'You've got to check it out, but this doesn't sound right,' he told The Associated Press. 'The working theories that have developed over the years, this really doesn't fit any of those.

Evidence: Roseville Police Department detectives carry soil samples removed from the site of the dig

Unearthed: On July 16, 2003, authorities searched under a backyard pool in Hampton Township, Michigan

Other attempts: In May of 2004, investigators ripped up floorboards of a home in the Detroit suburbs where one-time Jimmy Hoffa ally Frank Sheeran claims to have killed him

Hunt continues: In 2006, searchers in formation inspected a field at Hidden Dreams Farm in Milford Township, Michigan

'If this was the mob and they killed somebody, I just don't see them burying the body basically at the intersection of a residential neighborhood with this guy standing there.'

Berlin said he's not claiming it's Hoffa under the slab, but they are 'investigating a body that may be at the location.'

Neighbors say that the house where authorities are searching for Hoffa's body was a possible gambling den in 1975.

They
recalled seeing cars coming and going from the home at strange hours, 
however, the family of four that lived there moved away before police 
closed in.

A scan by 
ground-penetrating radar confirmed that the earth below the concrete pad
had been disturbed and that there is likely 'something' down there.

Feisty and iron-willed in contract talks, Hoffa was an acquaintance of mobsters and adversary to federal officials. He spent time in prison for jury tampering.

The day he disappeared, Hoffa was supposed to meet with a New Jersey Teamsters boss and a Detroit mafia captain. He was declared legally dead in 1982.

Previous tips led police to excavate soil in 2006 at a horse farm more than 100 miles north of Detroit, rip up floorboards at a Detroit home in 2004 and search beneath a backyard pool north of the city in 2003.

There were even rumors that Hoffa's remains were ground up and tossed into a Florida 
swamp, entombed beneath Giants Stadium in New Jersey or obliterated in a
mob-owned fat-rendering plant.

Roseville is one of several inner-ring communities that grew quickly as unionized auto factory workers left the city in search of nicer homes and bigger yards.

News of the latest search has brought attention to the mostly working- and middle-class suburb from the curious and naysayers.

Slowly moving vehicles have clogged the residential street as camera-wielding neighbors snapped photos for keepsakes.

'I believe it's him. My sister said it is, and she's a psychic,' said Mike Smith after ambling up to the home Thursday and shying a bit from the yellow police tape stretched across the driveway.

One local theory that has endured was that the body was beneath the foundation of a downtown Detroit hockey stadium, said 57-year-old Cindi Frank, who snapped photos Thursday of the driveway.

Believed dead: Hoffa was declared legally deceased on July 30, 1982, when he would have been 69

The daughter of a unionized driver and salesman for a Detroit bakery, Frank remembers conversations about Hoffa while he was alive and rumors about his fate.

'It was a family thing. Every time we'd go somewhere we'd say, "Hey, I wonder if Jimmy Hoffa is buried there?"' Frank said. 'It's just been one of those unsolved mysteries that's gone on for 30-something years. If he show up in Roseville...'

Some think the least likely spot for him to turn up might just be the place he does.

'Maybe the most inconspicuous spot might be the place to stash a body or something,' said 52-year-old Andrew Kacir, who lives across from the taped off driveway.

Former agent John Anthony, who spent years investigating
Hoffa’s disappearance, told WDIV-TV: 'I would say it has no credibility at all. It doesn’t
match up with anything we already know. I'd say it’s just another story - someone
trying to get publicity or looking after a reward.'

The tipster came forward months ago after first speaking with Dan Moldea, a journalist and author of the book 'Hoffa Wars,' the Detroit News reported.

The
man, who has no mob connections, was simply at the wrong place at the 
wrong time when he watched men bury a black bag - which he took to be a
body - days after Hoffa disappeared, Mr Moldea said.

Mr Moldea said he, too, is skeptical of the claim.
