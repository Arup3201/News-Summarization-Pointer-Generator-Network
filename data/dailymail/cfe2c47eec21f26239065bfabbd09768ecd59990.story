Tottenham will not be making significant additions to their squad this summer as Mauricio Pochettino puts his faith in last season's expensive flops.

Pochettino will stick with the players who cost the club over £100million last year, but failed to qualify for the Champions League.

In an interview with The Sun, the Spurs boss stressed that he believes the current squad is good enough to move the club forward, once they get to grips with his attacking philosophy.

Status quo: Pochettino does not intend to change much this summer in terms of personnel

Flashpoint: Spurs played their first game under their new boss on Saturday, a fiery 3-3 draw in Seattle

Faith: The likes of Erik Lamela, in action against Seattle on Saturday, will be given a chance to shine

'I think we have a very good squad already,' said Pochettino.

'Of course we always want to improve and it is possible we will add to the squad. But there will not be many changes.

'Last summer the club made a big overhaul and I believe in these players.'

The Argentine manager also insisted that expensive signings were no guarantee of success - something his new club learned the hard way last summer - and promised to avoid 'mistakes' in the transfer window.

'We are always looking to build - but without making mistakes - so you should not expect big changes.'

Philosophy: The former Southampton boss admitted it will take time for the players to adapt to his style

Spurs finished sixth last season, 10 points behind North London rivals in the fourth Champions League spot, as neither Andre Villas-Boas nor Tim Sherwood were able to get the best out of signings like Erik Lamela and Roberto Soldado.

But Pochettino promised to change the way the team plays, bringing in the exciting football that won him plaudits at Southampton.

'[The philosophy] will be to play exciting pressing, attacking football.

'At the moment we are only in the starting position, where we are trying to put this concept across to the squad. But we are very happy with the players and how that is going.'
