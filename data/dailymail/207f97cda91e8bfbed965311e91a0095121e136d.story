Testimony: Saajid Badat, who spent six years in jail for terror offences, gave evidence via video-link

A Briton has told the trial of Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law that he wore a shoe bomb on a flight to the UK.

Saajid Badat, who gave evidence in the New York trial via video link from Britain, said yesterday he wore the bomb on at least one flight between Holland and the UK in December 2001.

But he said he didn’t detonate it because he was saving it for an attack over America.

Badat, 34, revealed details of the plot as he testified at the trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, bin Laden’s son-in-law and Al Qaeda’s spokesman after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.

Badat, who was born in Malawi but grew up in Gloucester, was  convicted in the UK of plotting to bring down an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami with explosives hidden in his shoes.

He was released six years into a 13-year sentence after he gave  evidence against the terror group.

He agreed to give evidence via video link because he risks being charged again with the same crimes if he sets foot in the U.S.

Badat said he had only one shoe bomb because he gave his other one to several Malaysian men who wanted to blow open a plane’s cockpit door and carry out a 9/11-style hijacking of their own.

While wearing the shoe bomb, Badat said he flew from Pakistan to Holland and then on to the UK.

Prosecutors are using Badat’s testimony to show Abu Ghaith played a pivotal role with Al Qaeda when he warned Americans ‘the storm of aircrafts will not stop’ on videotapes widely distributed after the September 11 attacks.

Abu Ghaith, 48, faces life in prison if he is convicted of conspiring to kill Americans and providing material support to Al Qaeda. Bin  Laden’s son-in-law is the highest-ranking Al Qaeda figure to face trial on US soil since 9/11.

Badat, who said he spent time with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, described enthusiasm among recruits to the terror group after the September 11 attacks.

At one point during cross-examination, he was asked about a moment after September 11 when he and others laughed as mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed crossed the World Trade Center’s twin towers off a list of the world’s tallest buildings.

'Three thousand-plus Americans dead was humorous to you?’ defence attorney Stanley Cohen asked.

‘Unfortunately, yes,’ Badat said with a sheepish expression.

Badat said he decided not to go ahead with a suicide mission after he visited his parents in Gloucester in December 2001 and they asked what he had done in Afghanistan.

Badat, wearing a grey suit with a narrow black tie, told the court he recalled being asked in late September or October 2001 whether he would be willing to carry out a  suicide attack.

He said Osama bin Laden met with him soon afterwards, and told him that if he carried out an attack, he could bring down the American economy.

Badat said he saw bin Laden between 30 and 50 times in Al Qaeda training camps.

‘Blowing up airplanes was part of your responsibility?’ Mr Cohen asked. 'It was gradual, but yes,’ Badat said.

Mr Cohen also questioned him about experiments on rabbits and dogs involving poisons.

Badat said his instructor at an Al Qaeda camp called out references to American presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and former Israel prime minister Ariel Sharon as the animals were being killed.

Earlier, he had testified that faces of the presidents and Sharon were used as targets during Al Qaeda weapons training exercises.

‘This is Clinton! This is Bush! This is Sharon!’ he recalled the poison instructor shouting.

Badat testified that he believed violent acts were an obligation for him, ‘just like prayer, fasting or doing charity’.

He admitted that after he decided not to go through with the suicide attack that bin Laden had asked him to do, he had kept the explosives that had been hidden in his shoe, until he was arrested in 2003.

Asked why, he said: ‘I hadn’t really switched my views.

‘Maybe there would be a time I would need it again.’
