Sir Alex Ferguson’s new global status as a £100,000-a-time speaker on leadership is underlined by him following Tony Blair in making the keynote speech at the Arabian Business Forum next month.

Ferguson will address more than 400 captains of industry from across the Middle East at a Dubai hotel on November 10 before conducting an in-depth interview with broadcaster Andrew Neil the next day.

The Scot, 72, will surely receive at least his usual six-figure asking price, explaining why his earnings have hardly dipped since retiring from football. Manchester United still pay their former manager £2million a year for 20 days of appearances around the world.

Fergie also features prominently on the roster of speakers available through the Harry Walker Agency in New York, alongside Bill Clinton, Shimon Peres and Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the worldwide web.

BBC Sport are making great promotional ballyhoo about having the FA Cup back, starting with televising the first-round draw on Monday. Yet by not involving their main football presenter Gary Lineker (above) until the third-round entry of the big clubs, the BBC are effectively downgrading the importance of rounds one and two.

Championship side Leeds United have had their problems both on and off the pitch this season

The Leeds United pantomime has now seen wacky owner Massimo Cellino re-employ club secretary Alison Royston on a consultancy. This is despite Cellino having sacked her when he arrived at Elland Road. This followed an administrative bungle that allegedly led to winger Cameron Stewart starting a £750,000 legal action against Leeds for reneging on signing him permanently.

The Football League, meanwhile, are expected to decide at next month’s board meeting whether to charge Leeds with misconduct after Cellino and advisers withheld from them a fraud judgment by an Italian court that could result in Cellino failing the owners’ and directors’ test. A second court case in Sardinia about Cellino’s alleged tax evasion on his boat Lucky 23 has been delayed.

FA general secretary Alex Horne is leaving his £580,000-a-year job without a new post in mind. It is understood Horne believes his football c.v. after 11 years at the FA wouldn’t look much different if he spent another four years in the post — and most of those would have been spent alongside high-maintenance chairman Greg Dyke.

Labour's combative Shadow Minister for Sport Clive Efford called it a ‘bit rich’ that Tory incumbent Helen Grant is claiming their supporter ownership and engagement expert group announced this week was in the offing long before the Opposition’s manifesto pledge to put fans on football club boards. Efford said Labour had been calling for the Government to form such a group since it was first mooted by the Arsenal Supporters’ Trust in 2011. And Efford called it ‘ridiculous’ that Grant had no concrete supporter proposals, unlike Labour. 

Time up for FIFA gifts

The farce over the £16,400 Parmigiani watches handed out to delegates at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo last June continued right up to Friday's deadline to return them to Zurich.

FIFA have shamelessly passed the buck on to their ethics committee run by lawyer Michael Garcia, who was in New York while his watch spokeswoman was in Chicago.

But FA chairman Greg Dyke, who had notified Garcia that he intended to auction his Parmigiani for charity, has been informed he must return the watch. 

FA councillors are concerned that minutes from FA inclusion advisory board meetings are not disclosed. So there has been no transparency about how Edward Lord, chairman of the Amateur Swimming Association, was axed from the group for breaking ranks over the FA’s chronic lack of action in discrimination cases.

It is expected Chelsea will not appoint a chief executive to replace the departed Ron Gourlay but instead look for a commercial-focused chief operating officer, which was effectively the role Gourlay had been carrying out at Stamford Bridge.
