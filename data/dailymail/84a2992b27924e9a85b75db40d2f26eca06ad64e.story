BEST MATCH 

Third round — Petra Kvitova beat Venus Williams 5-7, 7-6(2), 7-5

Having lost the first set, Kvitova was just two points away from defeat at  4-5 in the second set.

However, the Czech battled back to overcome  34-year-old Williams, a five-time Wimbledon

Champion, in a thrilling two-and-a-half-hour battle, during which there were only two breaks of serve.

Williams was the only player to take a set off Kvitova at this year’s Championships.

BEST SHOT

Nick Kyrgios

Fearless 19-year-old Aussie Kyrgios produced the best shot of the tournament in the biggest match of his life against world No 1 Rafael Nadal.

Kyrgios was leading by a set and 3-3 when Nadal hit a forehand towards Kyrgios who opened his legs and played an amazing ‘tweener’ which a stunned Nadal could not chase down.

World No 144 Kyrgios went on to upset Nadal in four sets.

Celebrate: Nick Kyrgios gave Wimbledon its best shot against world No 1 Rafael Nadal at SW19

CHAMPIONSHIPS HERO

Victoria Duval

After winning her first qualifying match, 18-year-old American Duval, ranked No 114 in the world, received the news that she had been diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Rather than pulling out, Duval continued to play and qualified for the Championships, beating world No 29 Sorana Cirstea in the first round before going out to Belinda Bencic.

As the cancer was caught in the early stages, a full recovery is expected.

CHAMPIONSHIPS VILLAIN

Fabio Fognini       

The fiery Italian received the biggest on-site fine ever at a Grand Slam of $27,500 after a number of offences during his first-round match against Alex Kuznetsov.

Fognini was fined for damaging the grass court with his racket, abusing tournament supervisor Wayne McKewen and making an obscene gesture at his opponent.

Fognini was eventually knocked out in the third round by Kevin Anderson.

STRANGEST PRESS CONFERENCE 

Serena Williams

Five-time champion Williams was in no mood to talk at her pre-tournament press conference.

The American appeared disinterested, offering short and snappy answers to many of the questions asked.

It was all over in barely 10 minutes and Williams went on to suffer her earliest defeat at Wimbledon since 2005 when she was knocked out in the third round by Alize Cornet.

Most bizarre: Serena Williams was in no mood to talk at her pre-tournament press conference

ODDEST SIGHT 

Serena Williams (again)

Three days later, Serena returned to the All England Club with sister Venus to play their second-round ladies’ doubles match.

Serena appeared faint and was examined by medical staff before going on court.

When it came for Serena to serve she could hardly bounce the ball and wildly served four consecutive double faults before retiring at 0-3 down. The explanation was a viral illness.

WHAT I’D CHANGE

Stringent all-white dress code

The All England Club launched a strict ban on any item of visible clothing which featured a coloured trim of more than 1cm.

This even included underwear and former champion Pat Cash revealed he could no longer wear his trademark black and white headband.

Roger Federer even branded it as ‘too strict’. The club have gone too far here.

QUOTE OF THE FORTNIGHT 

Ernests Gulbis

‘My God. Umpires? I thought something else. I thought vampires in the way the people who are surrounding and sucking the energy out of players. That’s what I meant. ‘

Asked if he agreed with John McEnroe’s call to get rid of umpires and have players call their own shots, Gulbis provided a lengthy answer thinking the question was about vampires before he realised his misunderstanding.

Best quote: Ernests Gulbis misunderstood and thought a question was about vampires...

EYE-CATCHING OUTFIT

Eugenie Bouchard

Wimbledon’s all-white rule means there is not much room for creativity with on-court outfits.

However, off the court, Bouchard stood out for the red kimono she wore during a press conference.

The Canadian 20-year-old had received it as a gift after an interview with Japanese TV.

Standout: Eugenie Bouchard got creative - this certainly wouldn't fit the all-white dress code

CONTROVERSY

Marin Cilic v Tomas Berdych

Czech sixth seed Berdych was understandably not a happy man after being knocked out by Croatian Marin Cilic in near-darkness with their third-round match concluding at 9:38pm — the latest-ever finish on the outside courts at Wimbledon.

It was so dark that Hawk-Eye stopped working midway through the crucial third-set tiebreak.

Not happy: Tomas Berdych complains to the umpire about the line judges during the dark lighting

Dark: The match finished at 9.38pm - the latest-ever finished on the outside courts at Wimbledon

GRUNTER 

Bojana Jovanovski

Former Wimbledon runner-up Sabine Lisicki complained last year that she could not concentrate due to Jovanovski’s loud grunt.

Serbian 22-year-old Jovanovski returned this year and continued to make her unique noise — which sounds as if she is screaming out something like ‘Russia’ — after hitting the ball.

SPORTSMANSHIP 

Novak Djokovic

Top seed Novak Djokovic suffered a second-round scare as Radek Stepanek threatened to come back from two sets down.

Deep in a tight fourth set, Djokovic had game point for 6-5 when Stepanek hit a backhand which was called out.

Hawk-Eye ruled it in and the umpire ordered a replay.

However, Djokovic conceded the point, saying he would not have returned the ball.
