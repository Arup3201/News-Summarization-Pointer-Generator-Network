A mother told her two-year-old son how proud she was of him only seconds before an out-of-control car mounted the pavement and crushed her to death.

Desreen Brooks’s husband managed to push the boy’s pram clear of the Mercedes but could do nothing to save his wife.

Distraught Ben Dutton, 33, said last night: ‘I reacted to save my son and it ended in tragedy. It could have been all three of us.’

Mr Dutton said he, his wife, also 33, and their son Jackson had spent ‘a lovely day’ with friends in Hampstead, north-west London, on Saturday. They were setting off home to Dulwich, south London when the tragedy happened.

‘On our way home I remember we were struggling to push Jackson along in his pram. He really hates the thing,’ he said.

‘She had bent down to say to him that he had been such a good, well-behaved boy all day and that she was so proud of him. She turned to me and you could see she was so proud of him. Those were last words she ever said.’

Mr Dutton, managing director of London public relations agency Mischief, added: ‘The next thing the car was coming towards us and I pushed Jackson out of the way. It was all a bit of a blur. It all happened so quickly.

‘The next thing I remember was the emergency services coming and Des was taken away. There was no need for an ambulance, it was too late by that point.’

Another woman, American student Amy Werner, 23, was also hit by the car, and was badly injured. The Mercedes then collided with a garden wall.

Tributes left at the scene of the crash today

Two off-duty doctors who live on the street heard the crash and went to help, but they were unable to save Ms Brooks, a fashion stylist.

Miss Werner, a postgraduate student at the University of Westminster studying events and conference management, was yesterday in a ‘critical but stable’ condition in the intensive care unit at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, west London, police said. Her parents were by her bedside after flying to London.

Miss Werner was left with bleeding on the brain and broken bones in her lower left leg, her upper left arm and in her pelvis and face, a friend wrote on Facebook. The car’s driver, an 83-year-old man, was taken to hospital with minor injuries after the crash, which happened at 8.40pm on Saturday. Police are examining his car and say there have been no arrests.

Mr Dutton met his wife eight years ago in the queue at Fabric nightclub in central London. They married in August last year. Earlier this year, Ms Brooks launched fashion management company Saint Luke Artists.

Paying tribute to his wife, Mr Dutton said: ‘She was an amazing wife and an amazing mother. Jackson worshipped the ground she walked on. She was a beautiful woman both inside and out. I loved her so much. I still can’t believe she’s gone.’
