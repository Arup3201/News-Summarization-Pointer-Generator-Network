His bare hands shaking in nervous anticipation, a young base jumper prepares to throw himself from the top of a 120-metre power pylon.

As the hapless daredevil shuffles tentatively towards the edge of the platform, the anxiety on his face is clear, even in this grainy handheld footage, filmed by a friend.

But little does he know that his fears are about to come true as he finally plucks up the courage to make the leap into the snowy abyss.

Seconds into his fall it becomes clear that the man's parachute has failed to open and he plummets towards the earth in  Konakova, Russia.

He hits the ground with a muffled thud and a puff of snow as his friend can only look down from above.

This unnamed jumper can consider himself lucky after a spate of deaths have marred the perilous sport.

Last month, British base jumper Jake Simkins died after his parachute became tangled on the cliff face while he was base-jumping on a Greek island.

The 41-year-old called his girlfriend, who was almost seven months pregnant, at a nearby hotel to raise the alarm.
