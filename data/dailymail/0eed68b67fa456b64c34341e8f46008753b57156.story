CCTV has captured the shocking moment a grandfather was beaten to death on the street in New York’s East Village.

Ruan Wen Hui, 68, had just dropped off his
 granddaughter when he was attacked on East Sixth Street.

Officials said a suspect came up from behind about 8:45 p.m on Friday and started yelling at him.

Mr Ruan was a father of three and a grandfather

Surveillance video from the scene 
shows Mr Hui trying to move around the man to get away, but suddenly the suspect tosses him against a wall, then stomps and 
punches him in the head.

After the attack, the assailant is seen walking away - police have released a grab of the CCTV footage.

A witness called 911 to report the attack, but  several people walked past before anyone came to help Mr Ruan.

Mr Ruan, a Chinese immigrant, who spoke no English, was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he died the next day.

The father of three worked in a
 garment factory for the last 15 years, his daughter said and was now retired.

Jenny Ruan, 39, the second-oldest daughter, visited where her father died at the weekend and said in Chinese: 'So many people passed. They didn’t help, they didn’t call the police. Why wasn’t I here when you needed me?' reported The New York Times.

Law enforcement sources tell NBC 4 New York that investigators have identified a suspect in the attack and are looking for him.
