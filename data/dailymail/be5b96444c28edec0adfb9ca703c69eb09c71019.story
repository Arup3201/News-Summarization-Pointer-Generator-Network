She is the perennially cool actress whose off-duty attire is just as covetable as her edgy red carpet choices.

So when Kate Bosworth was announced as the much anticipated face of Topshop in December last year, the fashion world couldn't contain their excitement.

After releasing a Christmas song for the retailer and posing on the red carpet of their Los Angeles store opening, the only question on everyone's lips was: where are the clothes?

Sneak peak: Kate Bosworth donned an outfit she helped Topshop design at Coachella festival this weekend

But now, we have been granted a sneak peak of Kate's work with the high-street giant, because she donned an outfit that she helped the store design at this weekend's Coachella festival..

The 29-year-old showed off toned legs 
in tiny embroidered cream shorts paired with a matching sleeveless top 
as she walked hand-in-hand with her fiance Michael Polish at the 
celebrity-studded event in the California desert.

Boho chic: Kate looked effortlessly cool in the matching cream embroidered vest and shorts

Speaking to Style.com about her outfit, she revealed: 'The design team and I thought a lot 
about the festival season, and, particularly with this collection, a lot
of it was about the California girl.

'Obviously the perfect place to 
wear it was Coachella.'

While Kate won't be putting her name to the line like many of her predecessors, including Kate Moss, she will be working on part of Topshop's forthcoming 'Festival' project.

Part of the brand: Kate appeared at the Los Angeles opening of the store but is yet to reveal further details of any clothing collections

A Topshop spokesman described this as a: '360 degree campaign that involves music, clothes, film, journeys and the attitude and energy of British festivals', which will get underway later this year.

Speaking about her work with the brand Kate said: 'I have always been a 
fan of the Topshop brand and it has been an honour to work with Sir 
Phillip and the team.'
