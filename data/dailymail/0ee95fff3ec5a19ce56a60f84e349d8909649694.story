Apple is expected to launch a 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch version of its iPhone 6, with the larger model rivalling the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

While numerous images of the 4.7-inch version have been leaked over the past few weeks, until recently details of the 5.5 inch model have remained a mystery.

Now, prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm).

Prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). The photos suggest Apple is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5-inch phone

While the photos themselves aren’t groundbreaking, they suggest Apple is already producing components for the larger-sized phones, according to 9 to 5 Mac who first reported the leak, after Dickson tweeted the images.

An image last week, also leaked by Dickson, revealed the two new models side-by-side. These latest photos are the first images of the 5.5-inch version's display part.

Foxconn, which manufacturers around 70 per cent of the phone, recently hired 100,000 additional workers in mainland China to help produce the iPhone 6.

Both these moves suggest Apple is gearing up for the launch of new iOS devices around the usual September timeframe.

Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version.

Up
 until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest 
phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 
millimetres).

This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). 

By
 comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 
millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches 
(7.5 millimetres).

Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 0.31 inches (7.9 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One is 0.37 inches (9.3 millimetres). 

Separate reports have suggested the 5.5-inch model will be released several weeks before the 4.7-inch model, and will be produced in limited numbers.

Based on previous leaks, the new set of iPhones will launch in a thinner aluminium body and will include a sapphire crystal display covering for improved strength.

Users of Apple's next handset may also be able to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code found in the iOS 8 operating system.

Larger iPhones, the subject of months of speculation, would mark yet another incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch up to rivals like Samsung.

Taiwanese sources said the camera in the iPhone 6 will get a boost to 10MP, from its current 8MP version, along with a new lens offering better picture quality. It is also expected to boast a new filter, allowing for clearer pictures.

Apple's new devices are expected to use the in-cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible.

Australian blog MacFixit claims this is the rear case of the iPhone 6. As well as environmental readings, the rumoured sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone's location services

Users of iPhone 6 could have sensors to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code hidden in the iOS 8 operating system. This image is a screen grab from a video created by French site nowhereelse.fr. It features what is believed to be an industrial model of the iPhone 6 handset

Both iPhones are also thought to include a higher-resolution display with a pixel ratio of 1704 x 960.

They may also include an A8 system-on-a-chip for improved efficiency, performance boosts, and better battery life.

Apple also has the iWatch in the pipeline for release this year, which will include more than 10 sensors to take health measurements and other data.

Apple has been under pressure to release new products, as investors question whether the company that popularized the smartphone and the tablet computer is still able to innovate following the death of co-founder Steve Jobs.

Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc will start mass production of Apple first smartwatch in July, and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in October, it has been claimed.

Leaked images (pictured) and reports about Apple's next flagship phone - dubbed iPhone 6 - have been circulating since last year. If the rumours turn out to be true, the iPhone 6 will have a rounded, thinner design and a larger screen

Tag Heuer, part of luxury goods group LVMH, said on Friday its vice president for sales, Patrick Pruniaux, who had been with the brand for seven years, was leaving on Monday to join Apple - and is expected to work on the iWatch.
