Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho seems convinced that the Football Association and Premier League officials are wagering some sort of war against his team.

In his most recent television appearance, Mourinho appeared on Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday to discuss the various incidents that he believes have gone unfairly against the Stamford Bridge club this season. 

Although the Blues boss makes a compelling argument in some cases, there have been several occasions which have seen Chelsea lucky to escape without punishment. Here, Sportsmail looks at five moments when Mourinho's Chelsea side got away with it.

Branislav Ivanovic vs Everton 

Chelsea's star full-back has been one of Mourinho's most reliable soldiers this season, fighting for the cause and often popping up with crucial goals for his team.

The Serbian defender took his fighting spirit slightly too far during Chelsea's 1-0 win against Everton earlier this month as he became the main aggressor when both sets of players came together in an angry confrontation.

Gareth Barry was shown a red card for a late challenge on Willian, but Ivanovic, who grabbed James McCarthy around the neck before aiming a slight headbutt towards his opponent escaped without a card.

Ivanovic then played a crucial part in Chelsea's winning goal, heading the ball towards goal before a Tim Howard clearance was met with a fierce finish from Willian. The FA also decided against handing the 31-year-old any retrospective punishment.

Gary Cahill vs Tottenham

Gary Cahill was lucky to stay on the pitch during Chelsea's shock 5-3 defeat to Tottenham on New Year's Day, after  kicking out at Harry Kane.

With the score at 4-2 the England defender was tussling for the ball with Spurs' two-goal hero when the striker fell to the floor.

Cahill, who had earlier conceded a penalty for fouling Kane, took a swing at the forward, clattering him in the back.

With the ball a good yard away it is difficult to see how Cahill could claim to have been attempting to play it, particularly with Kane's whole body between the defender and the ball.

Cahill then appeared to stamp on the prone forward's leg, although that was at least closer to the ball, and could have been an attempt to retrieve it.

However, referee Phil Dowd seems not to have seen the incident, failing to punish the centre half for the violent play.

Gary Cahill vs Hull 

The England vice-captain made headlines for all the wrong reasons after taking an embarrassing dive during Chelsea's 2-0 victory against Hull in December.

The dive, which Hull boss Steve Bruce claimed would be more fitting in 'Swan Lake', came in the 53rd-minute as he passed between David Meyler and Tom Huddlestone in the Hull area. 

Referee Chris Foy did not give a penalty but he enraged Hull manager Bruce by opting against showing Cahill a second yellow.

Gary Cahill vs Liverpool 

Mourinho's side were lucky not to concede a late penalty at Anfield in November after Cahill seemed to block a Steven Gerrard strike with his forearm. 

The English defender had also been in the spotlight for a block in controversial block in the first half after he put his should towards Raheem Sterling's effort.  

The Blues ended up holding onto their 2-1 lead to earn a valuable three points after goals from Cahill and Diego Costa.  

Even Chelsea skipper John Terry conceded that Liverpool should have been awarded a penalty, saying: 'We have had some not go our way, it evens itself out'.

Diego Costa vs Manchester City

With the 2014-15 Premier League season only five weeks old, Costa showed England a glimmer of his fiery side after a tangle with City defender Pablo Zabaleta.

The Argentine defender was rightly shown a second yellow card for a late challenge on Costa, who reacted by placing his hands around Zabaleta's neck for a split second.

Zabaleta's sending off came moments before Andre Schurrle gave Chelsea the lead, with Costa involved in the move leading to the goal.

However, Frank Lampard came off the bench to rescue a point for the 10-man champions against his former club.
