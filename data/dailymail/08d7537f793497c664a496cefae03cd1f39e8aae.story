Tucked away at Manchester City's Carrington HQ is a little transfer gem.

Well, maybe not little; 5ft 11ins and 13st of pure muscle, actually.

It's Micah Richards - the man once heralded as the undisputed successor to Gary Neville's England right-back. 

Where did it all go wrong? Micah Richards (centre) appears to have no future at Manchester City

Next big thing: Micah Richards broke on to the scene with a last-minute equaliser for City at Aston Villa in 2006

From being one of Europe's hottest teenage properties, Richards' chances of first-team football under Manuel Pellegrini are virtually non-existent.

As if his chances of senior football were not remote enough thanks to outstanding form of Pablo Zabaleta, the summer arrival of Bacary Sagna has pushed Richards further down the pecking order.

But with six days left to go of the transfer window, the versatile defender is still to escape his City hell.

First and foremost, it's important to stress that Richards isn't happy simply taking his money and remaining in the Etihad Stadium shadows.

He wants a move; a chance to kick-start his once burgeoning career.

Likewise, City manager Manuel Pellegrini has publicly stated his decision to let the 26-year-old leave for pastures new.

So where is the problem, you might ask?

You might start dissecting the issue when considering Richards' asking price.

Despite having less than 12 months on his contract, City value the defender at around £7million. 

Joy: Richards (centre) appeared to have the world at his feet and it seemed he would be in first team for years

Surplus: Richards does not look like he will get any game time at the Etihad Stadium this season

They have tried to extend his contract, twice, but Richards has turned down both offers - which would have secured him a pay rise - knowing he could fade further into the football wilderness remaining at City.

There's not been a shortage of interest in the right-back, either.

Arsenal, Liverpool, Everton, Tottenham and West Ham have all given serious consideration to signing Richards.

But £7m for a player who will be available for nothing next summer makes little financial sense.

Richards' camp hope that issue will be resolved this week.

Sportsmail understands the player's representatives will meet with City officials in the next few days in a bid to resolve the issues that have prevented his exit this summer.

As well as Premier League interest there is strong interest from Italy and Turkey, and Richards is open to a move abroad to kick-start his stalling career.

The next six days will be crucial in determining how Richards stops the downward trend.

A move this summer will help reinvigorate a career that once promised so much; another 12 months on the sidelines at City would merely add to his reputation as English football's forgotten man.

Arrival: The signing of Bacary Sagna has made Richards third-choice right-back at the Etihad Stadium

Looking ahead: Richards (right) signed a long-term contract in 2008 and was expected to stay be City's future

But the transfer stand-off does little to explain why Richards has fallen off the radar so rapidly over the last two years.

Richards played a key role in City's first ever Premier League title triumph in 2012 - making 37 appearances for the club.

His performances that season saw him nominated for the club's player of the season award.

Roy Hodgson was taking notice, too.

Richards just missed out on England's Euro 2012 squad, but was offered a place in the stand-by group.

His much-publicised decision to turn down the opportunity was met with huge criticism. Richards had his reasons, though.

As he explained at the time: 'I have always said I wanted to play for England.

'Whether I get picked for the next game, it's not down to me. All I can do is keep knocking on the door.

'I will never turn my back on England. A lot of people asked me why I didn't go on standby. It was nothing to do with not wanting to play for England.

'I wanted to play (get on pitch, not just be on standby). Stuart (Pearce) has given me the chance to play (at London 2012).' 

International: Micah Richards played for England against Holland in 2012 and appeared to be back on track

Prospect: Richards burst on to the international scene and he was expected to turn into a world-class defender

In hindsight, the decision probably wasn't the smartest.

Not necessarily because of the stigma that has followed his ever since, but because of the injuries that have followed.

He picked up an ankle injury that ruled him out for 10 weeks playing for Team GB at the Olympics; subsequently he went on to make just seven Premier League appearances for City that season.

A knee injury sustained against Swansea in October 2012 ruled Richards out for six months, allowing Zabaleta to establish himself as City's premier right-back.

The Argentine's outstanding form has played a key role in Richards' lack of game time in recent seasons.

But so too has his unwillingness to sign a new contract.

Preferred: Dedryck Boyata has signed a new deal at the Etihad and will feature ahead of Micah Richards

Power: Richards was renowned for his strength and speed and looked set to dominate the Premier League

And there is a feeling within the Richards camp that the deal snub has played a key role in Manuel Pellegrini's decision to push the defender to the City peripheries.

Zabaleta's performances are generally considered the main reasons for his lack of action, but while Pellegrini rotated in every position last season - the right-back slot remained consistent.

Left-back Gael Clichy made 32 appearances for City last season, his rival in that position Aleksander Kolarov made 44.

In contrast, Zabaleta made 48 appearances last season, Richards just 10.

Pellegrini has pointed to Richards' injury problems last season, but those close to the versatile defender insist he was unavailable for just 10 games last season.

The next few days is likely to shape whether Richards can re-affirm his position as one of England's premier defenders.

What is for sure, though, is that his next club will be getting a player desperate to make up fir two years in the wilderness.
