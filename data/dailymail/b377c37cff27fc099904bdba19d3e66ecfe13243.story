Unlucky: Mary Roberts, who survived the sinking 
of the Titanic, then endured a second shipwreck just two years later in 
the North Sea near Whitby

Its owner survived the sinking of the Titanic and then endured a second shipwreck just two years later.

Now the trunk Mary Roberts lost in her latter brush with a watery grave has resurfaced for sale on eBay.

Miss Roberts spent a life at sea before finding fame by living through the infamous Titanic disaster in 1912, then surviving the sinking of the Rohilla in 1914.

But her trunk had been presumed lost 
to the North Sea since tempestuous winds smashed the steamship against 
rocks to the west of Saltwick Nab, near Whitby, North Yorkshire.

Wednesday
saw the 99th anniversary of the sinking of the Rohilla, where lifeboat 
crews battled for 50 hours to pull 144 survivors from the wreck.

As
the Rohilla sank Mary Roberts was brought ashore by lifeboat, and was 
later quoted as saying the Rohilla sinking was worse to endure than the 
Titanic.

Miss Roberts had been a stewardess for White Star Line for several years when she signed on for the Titanic’s maiden voyage.

When it launched, the RMS Titanic was one of the most opulent liners to have ever been built and the largest steamship in the world.

It struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City and sank on April 15, 1912, claiming the lives of 1,517 passengers and crew.

The crew of the ship had failed to heed warnings of ice in the North Atlantic and were sailing at speed through an ice field when it struck the huge floe.

Those who either drowned or froze to death in the disaster died mainly because there were not enough lifeboats on the ship and those that were used were half-empty.

There was no chance of survival in the -2.2C water.

Miss Roberts was one of the lucky ones. She left the doomed liner on lifeboat Number 11, helping to look after a small baby until being rescued by the Carpathia.

She would later note that the White Star Line stopped her pay at 2.20am, the exact time Titanic sank.

Missing for 99 years: Pete Thomson, curator of 
Whitby Lifeboat Museum, with Miss Roberts's trunk, which she lost at sea
when the Rohilla was dashed against rocks in heavy gales and 
tempestuous seas in 1914

But it was after only a short recovery that she felt the call of the sea again, signing on to the Rohilla as a nurse.

A
ship of the British India Steam Navigation company, the steamer had 
been commandeered by the government to operate as a hospital ship at the
outbreak of the First World War.

It
was carrying more than 200 patients and crew when, amid fierce gales 
and wartime black-out conditions at 4.00am on on October 30, it struck 
Whitby Rock, a reef at Salwick, south of Whitby town.

The
boat was only 660 yards from shore, but the storm force winds 
complicated efforts to rescue survivors from the wreck and treacherous 
seas.

Whitby's life boat
could not make it out of the harbour, and had to be carried by hand 
over an eight-foot sea wall and across rocks so it could be launched 
from a nearby beach.

Miss
Roberts, one of only five women aboard the Rohilla, was among the first
17 survivors rescued by the Whitby lifeboatmen, which went back to 
rescue a further 18 before it too was smashed by the storm.

But
by then, a further six RNLI lifeboats had arrived and valiantly 
continued the rescue operation for a weary, wet two days, eventually 
saving most of the 229 people aboard.

Eighty-five lives were lost in the disaster.

Her trunk, an 
intriguing relic of maritime history, has now been recovered by the 
Whitby Lifeboat Museum, after its curator, Pete Thomson, spotted it on 
for sale on eBay.

He said: 
'It’s spooky, the fact that I have got this here now, 99 years later. 
Mary Roberts carried it on to the Rohilla and then she never saw it 
again.

'When
the sea calmed down the rocks would be crawling with people picking up 
items and it’s been missing for the last 99 years until it surfaced on 
eBay for sale a month ago.'

Mr Thomson, a former lifeboat coxswain, was not even aware of the antique’s existence until he contacted a friend who had attended the 90th anniversary in 2004 who happened to mention the trunk.

Scavenged from the wreck? The box was found in a house clearance in York earlier this year, but its history before that is a mystery

'If I hadn’t made that phone call I wouldn’t have got it. It was an absolute freak of luck. It’s such a coincidence, it’s almost as if the Lord’s looking out for us,' he said.

Mr Thomson contacted the seller, an antiques dealer in Louth, Lincolnshire, who agreed to sell it to the museum for just £50.

Made of tin, with wooden struts, the box was found during a house clearance in York earlier this year, but prior to that its history is unknown.

The Rohilla was built in 1906 by 
Harland and Wolff in Belfast, the same shipyard that would later 
construct the equally ill-fated Titanic.

Whereas
the Titanic sank in calm water, the weather during the Rohilla disaster
was tempestuous, with gales and huge waves battering against the ship 
as it broke apart.

Since 
purchasing the trunk, Mr Thomson has been in contact with the 
descendants of Miss Roberts, who didn’t know of its existence.

The
trunk is now set to feature in a national World War One exhibition 
focusing on the brave lifeboatmen who rushed to the aid of the stricken 
vessels and their beleaguered survivors.

Called
Hope in the Great War, the touring exhibition will celebrate the 
courage and bravery of the lifeboat crews who risked their lives for 
strangers during the First World War.
