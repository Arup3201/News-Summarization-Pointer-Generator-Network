An lawyer who allegedly likes to dress like as a TSA worker for cavity search sex tapes is accused of choking a girlfriend he met online when she tried to break up with him.

Christina Leos, a former preschool teacher told a court that Ryan Hemphill, 33, allegedly choked her during an S&M session.

Hemphill, who attended Hofstra University School of Law in New York before working as a legal advisor, has been charged with second-degree strangulation, menacing, criminal obstruction of breathing and weapon possession, the New York Post reports.

A document read by the paper says the victim who met Hemphill on dating website eHarmony was left with cuts on her mouth and bruises to her wrist and elbow. 

During pretrial hearings, prosecutors said the couple made a sex tape where he pretended to be a 'TSA agent, searching her body cavities,' papers state.

Leos told the jury that when she tried to break up with Hemphill in February 2013 he became violent and he grabbed her and picked up a Bowie knife before telling her he would slit her throat.

Hemphill denies the charges. A document read by the paper says the victim who met Hemphill on dating website eHarmony was left with cuts on her mouth and bruises to her wrist and elbow.

She said they made up the next day but then had another row the following month. 

'He grabbed me and started strangling me,' Leos said, weeping.

'He had one hand on my neck and one covering my mouth and pushing down on my nose. That's when I realized I can't breathe.'

She said Hemphill finally released her and she fled and called the police the following day.

Hemphill denies the charges.

Hemphill also had over a dozen homemade porn videos - he is seen choking, water-boarding and torturing prostitutes, prosecutors said,

'One of the objects we recovered is a baton, looks like a police baton, and inside, if you undo it, is a sword,' prosecutor Sara Weiss said. 

'He is in multiple videos holding that sword to the neck of blindfolded women, women he, on some occasions, urinates on, while he makes them recite prayers.'

The details of those videos were banned at trial, after his defense lawyer objected.
