The bidding war for the British television rights for the Fight of the Century is coming to its climax.

Sky Sports have been considered favourites to screen Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao since their $300 million purse deal was struck for May 2 in Las Vegas.

They appeared to have moved firmly into pole position when given access to Mayweather’s gym in Las Vegas prior to joining the battery of cameras at the official red carpet launch of the promotion in Los Angeles.

The rights to broadcast Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao's May 2 bout in the UK is to be decided

However, Frank Warren's BoxNation remains in contention with a potentially innovative package

Their film of those events and interviews feature in their Ringside programme this very Thursday evening.

However, it is understood that Frank Warren has been in urgent discussions with Mayweather’s own promotion company and Pacquiao’s Top Rank promoters overnight on Wednesday.

Warren has built a strong relationship with the Americans while screening a steady flow of major fights in the US on his dedicated BoxNation channel, including Mayweather and Pacquiao bouts.

Mayweather and Pacquiao will be the richest fight ever and set the UK broadcasters alone back at least £12m

It is expected that whoever wins the rights will have to put at least £12 million into the financial pot for the richest fight of all time.

Sky are having to consider pushing their pay-per-view charge above their notional £20 barrier.

Warren is believed to be offering an innovative package for his monthly subscription network which could raise the ante higher.
