Victims of the Asiana Airlines plane crash suffered severe road rash, suggesting they were dragged as the aircraft smashed into the ground, doctors have revealed.

At a press conference on Sunday morning, Dr Margaret Knudson, the chief of surgery at San Francisco General Hospital, listed the devastating injuries the victims suffered, from head trauma, paralysis, broken spines, abdominal injuries and inhalation issues from the thick smoke.

She said that some of the passengers had also suffered chest injuries, likely from seats in front smacking into them on impact. Surprisingly, the patients did not suffer any severe burns, she said.

More than 180 passengers were treated at local hospitals after the Boeing 777 crash landed on Saturday morning, severing its tail and bursting into flames. The list of the injuries gives further insight into the terror the passengers endured as the plane smashed to the ground.

Injuries: Dr Margaret Knudson, chief of surgery at San Francisco General Hospital, has revealed that the victims of the Asiana Airlines plane crash suffered head trauma, paralysis and broken spines

At the press conference, Dr Knudson said San Francisco General treated 27 adults and 26 children from the crash. Of the 19 still at the hospital, six remain in critical condition, including one child.

'A couple have severe road rash, suggesting that they were dragged over something,' she said, adding that these injuries were 'everywhere - the back, extremities, face'.

'It's like an injury from a motorcycle crash when someone is not wearing leathers,' she said. 'We don't know how they got it but we were a little surprised to see it.'

The passengers treated at the hospital had all been sitting in the back of the plane when it crashed into the ground and came to a standstill just off the runway, she said. Most are now conscious.

She said that not all of the unconscious
 patients have been identified, and hospital staff suspect that two 
stewardesses could be among them.

One female patient told Dr Knudson that she had seen seats in front of her crash into her chest. She had been unable to move as she was restrained by a seatbelt.

But the doctor dismissed suggestions that the victims would have avoided chest injuries if they had not been wearing their belts, saying: 'If you were thrown out, you certainly would be worse [off].'

Those in critical condition suffered head trauma and severe abdominal injuries and one will require further surgery on Monday, she said.

Dr Knudson praised the quick response of her team as well as the triage staff on site, saying they promptly sent the most critical patients to the hospital.

'Two of them would likely not have survived' without this quick thinking, she said.

'This is the largest [incident] I've been involved with,' added Dr Knudson, who served with Air Force medical staff in Iraq in 2008. 'We were really well organized and everyone did their job perfectly.'

Destruction: Miraculously, more than 300 passengers aboard the plane survived the horrific crash

Crash site: The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214 at the San Francisco International Airport on Saturday

Victims were rushed to hospitals after the Boeing 777 from Seoul, South Korea to San Fransisco crashed landed on arrival in California.

Investigations are now underway to determine what caused the plane to crash. The president of Asiana Airlines said it did not appear an engine fault was to blame.

Passengers have said that they believe the plane was too low when it approached the runway, suggesting that the aircraft smashed into the sea wall dividing the airport from the bay.

Passengers have described how police officers 
threw utility knives up to crew members inside the burning wreckage so 
they could cut away passengers' seat belts.

Horrifying pictures taken by survivors showed passengers jumping down emergency 
slides and hurrying away. Thick smoke then billowed from the fuselage, 
and TV footage later showed the aircraft gutted and blackened by fire, 
with much of its roof gone.

Two Chinese school girls, Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, died in the crash and their bodies were found on the runway.

They were part of a group of 29 students and five teachers who had set off from Jiangshan Middle School - a highly competitive school in Zhejiang in eastern China.

Remarkably, the remaining 305 people on board survived but more than 180 people suffered injuries. The others escaped physically unscathed.

'I was near the plane and took a look inside,' San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said on Sunday. 'It was nothing short of a miracle that we had literally 123 people walk away from this.'
