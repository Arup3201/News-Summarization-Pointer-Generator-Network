An international appeal has been issued to companies who can save the Houses of Parliament from collapse.

Bids are being invited from specialist heritage firms to draw up plans for the £1billion restoration of the Palace of Westminster.

The historic building on the banks of the River Thames is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous landmarks in the world.

Restoration: A bidding process has been launched for firms to take on the job of rescuing the Houses of Parliament

Specialist companies are now being sought to find a way to carry out extensive work to repair the building, without distributing the process of British politics.

However, MPs and peers could be told to pack their bags and leave the site for up to two years, instead holding debates and votes in a temporary Parliament elsewhere.

Parliament officials have launched a bidding process for the restoration and renewal of the Palace of Westminster.

A spokesman said: ‘The successful bidder will be tasked with examining the costs, benefits, risks and general feasibility of three possible approaches to the restoration and renewal of the Palace.’

One option is for 'make do and mend' repairs to be carried out over an ‘indefinite period’ while a second option is for ‘a defined, rolling programme of more substantial interventions’ which would take place with MPs and peers still around.

Here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the Houses of Parliament to prevent a ‘looming crisis’:

ASBESTOSThe walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the Palace at risk.

ELECTRICSMuch of the building needs re-wiring, and generators do not produce enough power

VENTILLATIONMany original shafts are filled with wires, and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable.

HEATINGMany
boilers date from the 1930s, pipes are clogged with limescale and are 
in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could 
close the Commons chamber for months

FLOODINGFfaulty
guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding, and the Big Ben 
belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration. Walls are 
damp and stained.

LEAKY ROOFSA problem throughout the Palace, particularly as cast-iron roofs are coming to the end of their life.

DANGEROUS CEILINGSSeveral
pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth-century roof of Westminster 
Hall every year, while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the 
House of Lords chamber

DRAINAGE Pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected.

FIRE SAFETYOut of date alarms and automatic detection systems; little ‘compartmentation’ meaning fire can spread easily.

LIFTSOldest lift dates from 1893, several contain obsolete components. Only nine compliant with building regulations.

SUBSIDENCEAlthough
the report did not consider this, another problem is that the Palace is
sinking into the Thames, with Big Ben already leaning 18 inches.

But it is thought the most likely option is to schedule the works ‘over a more concentrated period with parliamentary activities moved elsewhere and unfettered access to the Palace for the delivery of the works’.

The tender was published in the Official Journal of the European Union yesterday.

Bids are due to be submitted by June 14.

Last year MPs suggested moving the Commons to Birmingham or the Olympic Village in East London.

However it had been thought that if MPs did vacate the famous green benches it would be to a site nearby, possibly in the shadow of the Big Ben clock tower or across the road the QE2 conference centre.

The bidding process sets out the ‘essential requirement that Parliament must be able to continue its work uninterrupted at all times’.

MPs have already rejected the nuclear option of moving out of the Palace altogether, turning it into a museum and building an entirely new parliament building somewhere else in London.

A report commissioned by Parliament last year found the Victorian structure is so stuffed with asbestos and leaky roofs that it will require billions of pounds of renovation just to keep it standing.

It warned that MPs and Lords will have to move out of the building within the next decade to enable a massive programme of works to electrics, heating, ventilation systems, drainage and stone work.

They concluded that the World Heritage Site - which contains the Commons and Lords chambers as well as suites of committee rooms, offices and dining rooms - was so poorly-maintained that it is ‘remarkable that it continues to function’.

And they warned that if nothing is done to make it safe, the Palace of Westminster could fall victim to a catastrophic fire the like of which famously destroyed its predecessor in 1834.

Although they do not put a final cost on the work, they say it will be at least £1.6billion.

The damning report on the state of the home of British democracy was ordered by the House of Commons Commission.

Published in November, it warned: ‘While the precise cost of rectifying these deficiencies is still unknown, investigations conducted in recent years indicate that it is already in excess of 40 per cent of the insurance reinstatement value of the Palace.’

There has been no renovation to the spectacular building, rebuilt along designs by Charles Barry in the 1850s, since the late 1940s, following the destruction of the Commons chamber by Nazi bombs.

The report goes on: ‘Considering the age of the Palace of Westminster, the 60-plus years that have passed since the partial post-war refurbishment, the long-term under-investment in the fabric and the intensive use to which the Palace is put, it is remarkable that it continues to function.

‘The signs of wear and tear, the number and frequency of relatively minor floods and mechanical breakdowns, the high cost of maintaining obsolescent equipment and the large sums that are now having to be spent on aggressive maintenance and risk reduction all provide tangible evidence of the looming crisis.'

Packing up: The Commons and the Lords are expected to be vacated for two years while the major works are carried out

‘A growing body of surveys, consultancy reports and risk registers point to the further deterioration that will occur and the severe hazards that could occur if fundamental renovation is delayed indefinitely.

‘It is hard to imagine how the Palace will survive for future generations to use and admire without a major mid-life overhaul.’

Among the many problems facing the building are antiquated electrics, clapped-out boilers and leaking roofs.

Asbestos, which is ‘present throughout the building’, is identified as a ‘risk to all persons within the Palace of Westminster’.
