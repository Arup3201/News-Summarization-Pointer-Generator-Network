A California snake specialist is charming his way into the hearts of America after being named People magazine's 'Sexiest Beast Charmer.'

Dr. Evan Antin, a veterinarian with a particular interest in reptiles, was chosen to appear in the magazine's Sexiest Man Alive issue in the Men at Work section.

He now practices in Thousand Oaks, California but has spent years traveling the world to help animals in distress on six different continents.

'I thought it was pretty funny,' he told KABC when asked about the honor. 'I've always strived to be the sexiest something, and so I'm glad it could be a vet.'

The Colorado State University grad has practiced at the Conejo Valley Veterinary Hospital for around a year and a half. 

However, he's traveled worldwide helping everything from elephants to crocodiles.

'It started with fear like that's such a weird animal and then it turned into this fascination,' Antin said.

Now he's an exotic animal specialist. Many won't be shocked to learn the 30-year-old has also worked as both a model and personal trainer.

But don't show up to his clinic hoping to use your pet lizard to get a date.

'Off the market unfortunately, but she's a special girl so I'm really happy,' said Antin, who is engaged.

Fans can catch his blog and Facebook posts nearly every day, though. The self-loving vet often posts pics of himself with adorable or exotic animals.
