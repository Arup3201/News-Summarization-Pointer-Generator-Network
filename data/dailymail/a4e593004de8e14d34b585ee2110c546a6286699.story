Union chiefs are threatening strikes which would worsen the passport crisis and enrage hundreds of thousands of families planning summer holidays.

The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union cynically seized on the problems at passport offices – which are struggling to issue travel documents in time – to warn that its members could take industrial action over job cuts.

It said the under-manned Passport Office was battling a backlog of up to 500,000 cases.

Overload: The Public and Commercial Services union said the Passport Office was in crisis because 'major job cuts and office closures' had left it unable to handle a surge in applications for travel documents

There are mounting fears that applicants will not get their documents before their departure date because of an ‘unprecedented’ surge in applications.

The PCS said the agency was in crisis because ‘major job cuts and office closures’ had left it unable to handle demand.

MPs have been inundated with more than 500 complaints in recent weeks from constituents about delays.

The Passport Office, which recorded a surplus of £73million in 2012-13, said it had issued more than 3million documents so far this year, after receiving around 300,000 more applications than in the same period last year. The Home Office website advises it takes three weeks to renew a passport, but travellers are complaining it is taking twice as long.

In a letter to the Passport Office’s chief executive Paul Pugh yesterday, the PCS said the problems were heightened by the loss of 315 staff and closure of 23 offices since 2010.

PCS chief Mark Serwotka said the union would consider industrial action if the situation was not addressed satisfactorily by the end of this month.

He added: ‘The Passport Office is failing holidaymakers because of a political decision to cut staff and close local offices.

‘While the economy is showing signs of 
recovery for some, the damage being done by the Government’s spending 
cuts is evident to anyone trying to get a passport at the moment and we 
are not prepared to stand by and allow this to happen.’

Labour immigration spokesman David Hanson said: ‘Home Secretary Theresa May has taken her eye off the ball.

Chris Gibbs, 30, left, should be on holiday in France but is stuck at home in Bristol because of Passport Office chaos.

He applied to renew his passport on May 13. After calling the helpline numerous times, he has been told his application has been moved from Durham to Glasgow.

He said: ‘I’m really disappointed. If they had warned people that there would be delays this summer, I would have applied much earlier.’

'We have more and more new applications adding to the backlog and by their own estimate the Passport Office have 16 per cent more demand than they expected.

‘This is a mess and it is ministers who will be responsible if people’s holidays are ruined.’

But the Home Office said the ‘vast majority’ were receiving their passports on time. A million had been issued since the start of April.

It added that since January the Passport Office had redeployed more than 200 staff – some from anti-fraud duties – to frontline operations to help meet the increased demand.

It had also boosted the number of call centre staff from 350 to 1,000.

A spokesman said: ‘We would remind people of our existing advice: Allow plenty of time when applying as a passport will not be issued until the necessary security checks have been done, and do not book travel until you have received your passport.’
