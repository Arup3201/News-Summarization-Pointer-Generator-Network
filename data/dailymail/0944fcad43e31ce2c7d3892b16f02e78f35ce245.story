Voicing her concerns: Camille Paglia is urging a major overhaul of sexual education classes in public schools so that the information is more focused on actual needs of students

A top academic has called for massive changes in the sex ed system so that rather than simply being told not to get pregnant, young girls should have discussions about how early their fertility rates begin to drop and when they should start trying to have children.

Camille Paglia, who is best known for her 1990 book Sexual Personae, made the bold declaration because she says the current  curriculum is so focused on preventing pregnancy and 'abstinence only' education that it may hinder would-be mothers later in life.

'Sobering facts about women’s declining fertility after their 20s are being withheld from ambitious young women, who are propelled along a career track devised for men,' Ms Paglia wrote in an op-ed for Time.

This is an idea she feels passionate 
about, saying teachers and parents should force their daughters to think
 about the larger picture of their life rather than just the present.

'I
 want every 14-year-old girl...to be told: You better start thinking 
what do you want in life. If you just want a career and no children you 
don't have much to worry about,' she said in a December Wall Street Journal interview.

'If,
 however, you are thinking you'd like to have children some day you 
should start thinking about when do you want to have them. Early or 
late? To have them early means you are going to make a career sacrifice,
 but you're going to have more energy and less risks. Both the pros and 
the cons should be presented.'

She
 goes on to explain that informing young girls about the rates at which 
fertility rates will drop off in their late 20s should not be taken as a
 seal of approval for teenage sex.

Separating the sexes: Paglia argues that boys and girls need to be taught different things in the classes and it is 'absurd' to address their concerns in the same setting, citing issues like date rape and fertility

'My
 generation of baby-boom girls boldly rebelled against the cult of 
virginity of the Doris Day 1950s, but we left chaos in our wake. Young 
people are now bombarded prematurely with sexual images and messages,' 
Ms Paglia wrote in Time.

She
 announced that girls and boys have to be separated during sexual 
education courses because it is 'absurd' to pretend that the sexes deal 
with the issue in the same way.

Big ideas: Paglia made her mark on the academic world with her 1990 tome that analyzed the history of gender dynamics

'Boys
 need lessons in basic ethics and moral reasoning about sex (for 
example, not taking advantage of intoxicated dates), while girls must 
learn to distinguish sexual compliance from popularity,' she said.

Ms Paglia, 66, has described herself as a 'contrarian' whose work has focused largely on sexual gender dynamics.

She writes that the morality issues that are so intrinsically linked to
 sex ed by politicians needs to be taken out of schools and that the 
classes need to be taught as impartially- almost clinically- as 
possible.

'The liberal 
response to conservatives’ demand for abstinence-only sex education has 
been to condemn the imposition of “fear and shame” on young people. But 
perhaps a bit more self-preserving fear and shame might be helpful in 
today’s hedonistic, media-saturated environment,' Ms Paglia writes.

Among the suggestions she pushes for are 
the removal of condoms from schools, the inclusion of menopause in 
biology class curriculum, and the ban on any perceived endorsement of 
homosexual relationships by sex ed teachers.

'In
 my view, antibullying campaigns, however laudable, should not stray 
into political endorsement of homosexuality or gay rights causes. While 
students must be free to create gay-identified groups, the schools 
themselves should remain neutral and allow society to evolve on its 
own,' she writes.

Ms Paglia was in a relationship with a female artist for more than a decade and legally adopted her partner's son in 2002. The couple split in 2007.
