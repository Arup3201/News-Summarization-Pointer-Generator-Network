Saved: The winning artwork was Madonna and Child by Renaissance master Pietro Perugino

As home to half the world’s artistic treasures, it is hardly surprising that cash-strapped Italy struggles to pay for their upkeep.

But officials, faced with unbearable choices on which masterpieces to save, have come up with a very novel solution – opening a Facebook vote to the public.

The government selected eight pieces of art in urgent need of restoration from across Italy and posted them on the social networking website.

The artworks ranged from an ancient Roman marble horse, which is on display in the world famous Uffizi Gallery, in Florence, to a painting of Mary Magdalene at the feet of Christ by Renaissance artist Fiorentino, which hangs in the Accademia museum in Venice.

The public were asked to click on the work that most deserved to be repaired.

The winner, following thousand of votes, was a Madonna and Child by Renaissance master Pietro Perugino, which is now undergoing restoration.

The other pieces will also be fixed as budgets permit, officials said.

Minister for Culture, Massimo Bray, said Italians wanted more opportunities to share in the difficult choices that had to be made about the country’s heritage.

Anna Maria Buzzi, head of heritage at the Culture Ministry explained: ‘Italy needs help restoring its art and monuments.

‘Ticket
 sales alone are not enough to completely fund their upkeep. We don’t 
even have a full understanding of how much art exists in the country.’

She added: ‘The strength of a democratic institution is listening to its citizens.’

‘Giving people the right to choose makes them more invested in their own heritage. It makes them care more. If you give the people more responsibility, they’re more likely to take an interest in their own culture.’

Italy is increasingly reliant on private companies to pay for renovations. Accessories brand Fendi has donated £2million to repair Rome’s Trevi fountain (left), while Diesel is paying for Venice’s Rialto bridge (right)

Italy spends billions less on its cultural gems than either France or Germany. Of European Union countries, only Greece invests less.

The country’s globally renowned archeological sites, such as Pompeii, suffer regular collapses for lack of repair.

Over the last year private companies have attempted to fill the gap, with luxury footwear label Tod’s footing the bill for the five-year restoration of the Colosseum.

Meanwhile homegrown accessories brand Fendi has donated £2million for the repair of Rome’s Trevi fountain, the famous setting for the 1960s film, La Dolce Vita, and youthful fashion house Diesel has stepped in to cover the maintenance of Venice’s Rialto bridge.
