The family of a 14-year-old whose murder 34 years ago was never solved have created a Twitter account in his name in a bid to crack the cold case and keep his memory alive.

Bill Comeans' body was found January 7, 1980 a block away from his West Columbus, Ohio, home after he was strangled by his own scarf. His killer was never found.

But this year, on the 34th anniversary of his death, his younger sister, Kathleen Comeans, set up the account @BillComeans to bring attention back to the unsolved murder, still hoping to find whoever took him from their family.

Clues: The 14-year-old's family created a Twitter account in his name in a bid to crack the cold case and keep his memory alive

In dozens of tweets, Kathleen describes Bill's murder as though he is recounting it himself from beyond the grave.

'34 years ago today, I was murdered. I was 14 and had my entire life to live. My family is still looking for my killer,' one early tweet reads.

Another disturbing message reads, 'I had to listen to my mother's screams and my father's sobbing, at the hospital, when the pastor told them I was dead. Nothing I could do.'    

'I miss him everyday,' Kathleen told 10TV, adding that she also created a YouTube tribute to her brother. 'When I was growing up, I followed him around everywhere, I was his little shadow.'

Emotional: Some of the tweets are deeply emotional

Kathleen was 9 years old when Bill was murdered.

'I can remember the night that we found out, the same feelings are there,' she said.

He had been attacked twice before but got free, sadly without seeing the perpetrator's face. The day he was killed, he was walking two doors down to collect his sister from a neighbor's house.

After Bill's death, his family received anonymous threats in the mail, directed at the kids on their street.

'I don't want him to be forgotten,' she said of her brother who would have turned 49 this week.

'Whoever murdered him is out there, so somebody knows something, and Bill's got a story to tell, and we'll use whatever means to tell it.'

Devastating: Bill had been strangled by his own scarf, pictured, and was found face down in a snowy ditch. He had been attacked twice prior to the murder - once in September and again in October of 1979
