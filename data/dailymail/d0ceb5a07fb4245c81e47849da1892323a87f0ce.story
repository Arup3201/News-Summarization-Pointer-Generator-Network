Nearly 100 General Services Administration employees, many of them high-ranking, claimed more than $750,000 in travel expenses in a nine-month period, despite the fact that they were assigned to work from home.

The government agency, which was recently under scrutiny for an $820,000 conference in Las Vegas, is again being put under the microscope for its operations.

According to the Washington Post, which first revealed the wild expenditures, the agency is looking into the matter, but doing nothing to curb the outlandish spending.

Taking the Fifth: Jeffrey Neely declined to answer questions at a hearing about wasteful spending and access at the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Monday

Documents turned into the House revealed that 95 high-ranking employees within the GSA who were assigned to work from home spent $750,000 in travel expenses in nine months.

In response to the outrageously high travel expenses, executive Jeffrey Neely, who has since resigned amid the Las Vegas scandal, wrote in an email to a college: ‘OMG…Well this is a fine mess we’ve gotten ourselves into.’

The Post reports that the so-called virtual workers were travelling to regional headquarters and to other events.

GSA spokesman Adam Elkington said yesterday that the agency is conducting ‘an extensive review’ on staff travel policies and deployment.

Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-California), meanwhile, demanded answers. ‘The American people have right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program,’ he wrote.

Twelve of the 95 ‘virtual’ workers claimed and received more than $200,000 in travel reimbursements between 2010 and 2011, the Post says.

Hearing: Government Services Administration officials were sworn in before testifying to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in April

Last week, embattled Neely left the agency, though Mr Elkington would neither confirm nor deny if he esigned or was fired from the agency that is in charge of federal buildings and supplies.

The GSA inspector general previously referred Neely's case to the Justice Department for a possible criminal investigation. Neely's departure would have no effect on the Justice Department's inquiry.

Neely had been placed on administrative leave in April as buildings commissioner for the Pacific Rim region. An inspector general's report on waste and abuse at the 2010 Las Vegas conference sparked hearings by several congressional committees.

Neely angered lawmakers by refusing to testify and asserting his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.

The Las Vegas conference featured a clown, a mind-reader and a rap video by an employee who made fun of the spending.

The scandal led to the resignation of GSA Administrator Martha Johnson, the firing of two top aides and the placing of nine others on administrative leave.

A GSA official who was not authorized to be quoted by name on personnel matters said four others have left the agency following their participation in the 2010 conference. The GSA has proposed to remove another four.

'GSA is in the process of completing its review of activities associated with the Western Regions Conference and pursuing all available avenues for appropriate disciplinary action against those responsible,' the GSA spokesman said.

'Jeff Neely was placed on administrative leave based on his involvement in the WRC (Western Regions Conference). As of today, he's no longer employed with GSA.'

Calls to Neely's attorney were not immediately returned.

Former employees like Neely can be prevented from participation in federal contracts and grants. Such action is under consideration in Neely's case, the official said.

Photos leaked across the internet last month , showing Neely enjoying wine in a bathtub at a luxury Las 
Vegas hotel during a 2009 'pre-conference.'

Photos posted on Neely's wife, Deborah Neely's, Google+ account record the 
couple's trip to the Las Vegas M Resort Spa & Casino in November, 
2009, showing the couple enjoying a luxurious weekend.

The couple's 
trip was a scout of the venue where the 2010 Western Regions Conference was ultimately held.

The
album, entitled 'M Hotel@Vegas Nov2009', includes a set of 31 images 
showing the couple enjoying their stay, many of which feature Neely in a
potentially embarrassing position given the ongoing investigation.
