Police in Rotherham have come under fire for holding a self-congratulatory awards ceremony just two weeks after a damning report accused the force of letting down sexually abused children.

A ceremony in the town last week praised officers for going 'above and beyond the call of duty' - and South Yorkshire Police then used its public Facebook page to boast about the event.

Local residents reacted with anger, pointing out that 16 days earlier the force was criticised for turning a blind eye to the abuse of 1,400 young girls.

The area's police commissioner said it was 'misguided' to publicise the ceremony at Rotherham United's New York Stadium, adding: 'I have very little sympathy.'

Awards: Rotherham police have been criticised for holding an awards ceremony just two weeks after a damning report found that they had failed to investigate child sex abuse

The event last Friday was held to honour officers from South Yorkshire Police working in the Rotherham area 'for their outstanding contributions to the town's police force'.

The force said in a Facebook post that the ceremony recognised 'officers and staff who went above and beyond the call of duty to protect and serve the public'.

But hundreds of people commented on the post accusing police of 'really bad timing' and saying they should be 'ashamed'.

Alan Billings, who was elected as South Yorkshire's police and crime commissioner after his precedessor Shaun Wright was forced to resign in disgrace, criticised the decision to publish details of the awards.

'Misguided': Local police commissioner Alan Billings criticised the force for publicising the event

'I have very little sympathy,' said Dr Billings, who attended the ceremony. 'I can completely understand the reaction.

'If someone asked me for advice I would have advised against that. I think it's probably misguided to put it on Facebook.

'I did go and talk to the district commander and the team before the awards and they did wrestle with the decision to hold it or not and they decided they would go ahead.'

Report: Louise Casey, pictured, found that South Yorkshire Police neglected its duty over sex abuse

Local councillor Emma Wallis wrote on Twitter: 'An award ceremony for Rotherham cops at NYS? Whilst rapists still stalk our streets? Couldn't make it up.'

South Yorkshire Police came under heavy criticism from a report published earlier this month by Louise Casey which investigated the reaction of officers and council officials to allegations of child sex abuse in Rotherham.

The report said that police had dismissed victims' complaints and referred to the girls involved as 'little slags' who were complicit in their own abuse.

One corrupt officer was even accused of having sex with a vulnerable child, and is now under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

The report concluded: 'The police's historic attitude towards, and treatment of, victims has been unacceptable.

'Inspectors are concerned that this attitude continues in the police to this day, with treatment of current victims remaining at an unacceptably low standard.'

Most of those who commented on the police awards ceremony expressed disgust at the decision to honour officers so soon after the report's publication.

Ellen Lawless wrote: 'Abuse scandal clearly a distant memory already! But then I suppose its easy to forget something you've spent years ignoring anyway! You ought to be ashamed! Disgusting.'

Neil Richards added: 'Really bad timing considering how incompetent they are over child grooming.'

And Tony Hand said: 'I wonder who won the turning a blind eye award? Bet all the council and police chiefs were nominated for that one!'

 

Anger: Facebook users accused the force of being insensitive over the awards ceremony

However, some defended the officers involved in the ceremony, saying that they should not be held responsible for the mistakes of the force as a whole.

Rotherham's police commander Jason Harwin said the force 'recognised that people must be held to account' over the scandal, but added: 'We also need to recognise when people do a good job and promote the exceptional work that takes place every day.

'The awards are a great way to recognise the dedication and commitment of our officers, staff and members of the community, who work tirelessly to make Rotherham a safer place.'

He insisted that the mood of the awards had been 'sober and restrained', and that those attending had mentioned the need to improve the policing of sex abuse.
