Designers are always looking for ways to make clothes as functional as possible, but one company may have taken it a step too far with a bizarre new idea.

A new range of jeans that come with hidden zips in the front pocket to grant easy access to your private parts are to go on sale after raising enough funds.

PlayPants are described as 'exceptional quality jeans with one magic feature - completely unzippable front pockets'.

'Playpants', which are jeans that come with hidden zips in the front pocket to grant easy access to your private parts, are to go on sale after a crowd-funding success on Kickstarter 

The unusual jeans are the brainchild of Lithuanian designer Robert Kalinkin, who put them on Kickstarter to raise £10,000 - and he was successful.

Writing about his creation on the site, Robert said: 'When not in use, the pockets function just as any other pockets would - you can safely store your belongings in them.'

He all lists all the reasons why he thinks you need PlayPants and when he thinks they may come in use, which include: itchy private parts in public, a lonely single night at the cinema, a boring corporate meeting, and a dull love life. 

The designers have installed two hidden zippers in the front pockets, which they say can be comfortably unzipped with one hand.

'And don't worry - the zippers are safe and secure, so your most precious possessions are at no risk,' they add.

PlayPants, which don't yet have a price, were created by Lithuanian designer Robert Kalinkin, who has been running his namesake label for more than three years.

While he understands that the jeans are 'fun', he also maintains that his team take the process of making them very seriously. 

'Every pair of PlayPants is hand-finished by experienced tailors at our in-house atelier,' he explains.

'We have also done careful textile research and picked the highest quality denim with just the right amount of elastane for ultimate comfort and flexibility. 

'The tailors are using extra-strength double stitching and overlocking methods to make these jeans virtually indestructible.' 

The quirky creations could be coming to a shop floor near you soon; Robert managed to raise £10,000 from 68 backers who were obviously enthused by his idea.

Speaking about the jeans, womenswear buyer, Becky Schneider, Accent Clothing, said: “As denim experts, we are always keen to see new denim styles/washes and features brought to the market. 

‘PlayPants is an interesting concept, but we’re not entirely sure if these jeans will catch on. We’ve learnt that denim enthusiasts are more concerned with the quality of the denim – its strength, wash, fit, etc. 

'The functionality of these jeans and their target market don’t suggest to me that these jeans will be a must have for the fashion heads or denim anoraks.'
