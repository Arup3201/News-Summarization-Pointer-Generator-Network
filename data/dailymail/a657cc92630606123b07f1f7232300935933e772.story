The Geordie Shore ladies are best known for fashion faux pas and flashing some flesh on nights out, but cast member Marnie Simpson is bucking the trend with a demure clothing range.

The former Miss Newcastle has teamed up with online retailer lasula.co.uk to offer shoppers the chance to copy her style and show the world that she can be taken seriously. 

The 22-year-old from South Shields said: 'I feel like girls my age are criticised for dressing too old or provocatively. I want to be able to dress nicely without looking like a total slapper, something which a lot of people just presume I am anyway without even giving me a chance.'
