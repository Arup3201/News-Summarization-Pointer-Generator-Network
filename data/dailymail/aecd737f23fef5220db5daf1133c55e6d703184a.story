Police arrested the five men after a series of dawn raids in central and west London on Tuesday morning, with counter-terror officers saying they had disrupted what was believed to be the early stages of what could have turned into a 'significant plot'.

The group is thought to have been orchestrating the first UK-based Islamic extremist attack since the spread of ISIS. 

Tarik Hassane, who lives in North Kensington, and Rawan Kheder, who lives in Chelsea, have been named locally as two of the men arrested last Tuesday.

Hassane, who claims to be half Moroccan and half Saudi, was arrested following a tweet sent to his friends which read 'Oi lads... I smell war'.
