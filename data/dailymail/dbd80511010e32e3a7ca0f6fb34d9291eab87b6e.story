Teething necklaces made from amber stones could snap and choke babies who have been given them to ease mouth pain, parents have been warned.

The small necklaces have amber gems on a string but mothers have complained that some have snapped, sending the tiny stones spilling onto the ground.

There are fears that curious tots could put the stones in their mouths and choke - or that they could even strangle themselves with the necklaces.

Danger: Amber teething bracelets such as this one could snap and babies could choke on the small gemstones, Trading Standards has warned

Trading Standards officers have issued warnings about the amber teething necklaces and some have been withdrawn from the market. 

The teething necklaces and bracelets have also been condemned by parenting group Netmums as 'costly and unproven'.

But the dangerous products are still widely available online, including at internet giants such as Amazon and eBay. Trading Standards said that the necklaces are also being sold by market traders around the country.

There are fears that many mothers have already brought them or will do so unaware of the risks.

Sarah Ridley, Trading Standards officer at Nottinghamshire County Council said: 'Although the necklaces are designed to be worn, not chewed, there is a serious risk involved in giving any product with small parts to small children.  

'Should the beads or clasps become detached, the parts are a choking hazard and the necklace as a whole presents a risk of strangulation.'

The necklaces are designed to be worn by babies to sooth and calm them when they are teething - a common problem for babies.  

A number of different designs and styles are available over the internet and they are targeted at children under 36 months.

The prices range from £6.95 for a small bracelet up to £26.95 for some of the necklaces.

Many of the necklaces are believed to be made in eastern Europe, where manufacturing controls are not as strict as the UK.

The chance of small parts breaking off and choking babies has caused a number of the bracelets to fail safety tests. There are also concerns that magnets found on some of the necklaces and bracelets could stick together inside the stomach if they are swallowed.

Customer reviews on Amazon included angry comments from mothers who became panicked after the bracelets snapped while their children were wearing them.  

One mother wrote last month: 'I bought this for my six-month-old son after hearing good things about it but I had just changed him and he was lying on the floor and managed to snap it.

'Luckily we spotted what he had done as the beads were all over the change mat and floor, especially as everything goes into his mouth at the moment! I do not recommend this product.'

Another added: 'Bought the anklet as I
thought it would be safer but its not, please be careful when wearing 
this on your baby.  

'I left
my 9 month old daughter on her changing mat on the floor while I went 
to wash my hands after changing her, I was gone not more than 30 
seconds, when I went back into the room I found that she had pulled her 
sock off and pulled the anklet, it had broke & the beads went 
everywhere.'

Netmums Regional Coordinator and On Line Health Visitor Maggie Fisher said: ‘Amber necklaces are a no-no in my book as they’re costly, unproven and may put a baby at risk of choking or even strangulation’.

The danger 
alert has also been issued by Bournemouth’s Trading Standards which is 
warning parents about buying amber teething necklaces for their young 
children.

Risk: Market traders around the UK may also be selling the dangerous bracelets, Trading Standards officers said (file picture)

Businesses based in Bournemouth have already been contacted by officers and advised to withdraw them from sale.

David Morton, Senior Trading Standards Officer, said: 'These particular necklaces have been withdrawn from the market in a number of European countries as a result of the safety issues.  

'However, we know that they are still being produced in countries such as Lithuania and being sold via the internet through a number of well known and established websites.

'I would urge local residents to not purchase these necklaces and put a child’s safety at risk. We have examined these products and due to small parts they pose a potential choking hazard for small children. In addition, cords around the neck can catch on fixed objects.'
