A 26-year-old mother and her 22-month-old son have been found dead by police after a suspected murder-suicide incident nine months after going missing.

It is thought that Angel Hudson, 26, known locally as Katie, killed toddler Arthur Hudson-Cardy and then took her own life at their home in Chorley, Lancashire.

Miss Hudson, who originally lived in Teignmouth, Devon, went missing from her home in November 2013 and was believed to have moved to Spain.

Police issued an appeal after family members were concerned they were unable to contact her.

It is not yet known whether officers from Devon and Cornwall Police ever traced the pair, who had since moved to an address in Euxton, Chorley.

The house where the pair died was owned by Miss Hudson's great aunt Mary Linley. Neighbours said Miss Linley, who died a spinster, often spoke of her grand niece Katie.

However, when Miss Hudson arrived in Lancashire, she called herself Sam Stone.

Neighbour Christine Thom said: 'I always knew her as Sam or Samantha and her little boy was called Arthur. She was very nice and she would come over on occasions.

‘She only moved in in January when Mary died.

'She never told me her personal circumstances. I just knew her as Sam, it was her Great Aunty’s home and Mary used to talk about Katie and I didn’t think any more of it. I had been looking after Mary because she was poorly after she died, Sam was at the funeral. Her father John came up for a day or two but I don’t know where he went back to. I honestly knew nothing about Sam.'

A teddy bear and a bunch of floors reading 'So Sad :( RIP xxx' were left outside the home. One neighbour described the mother as 'a really lovely lady'

Floral tributes have been left outside the home where the mother and son were found. Detectives said it was a 'tragic case' and that inquiries were still being carried out

Ms Thom continued: 'She seemed very happy, very confident and knew what she wanted. She didn’t give the appearance of being scared of anything. The garden was beautiful. She was having it landscaped. She had all the plans for the back garden. I knew nothing about her. The car would always go straight back in the garage.

'I didn’t see her much but she came over one day with the little boy and he played in the garden, it was general chit chat.

'It was a habit the blinds would be open in the morning, sometimes quite early but on Tuesday everything was closed and that was unusual. I kept coming to look across the road and I was getting worried.

'My Neighbour said he was going to call me too I rang her landline and sent her a text message but there was no reply. I couldn’t get any response. We both walked to the garage and we could see the silhouette of the car in the garage.

'I called her dad John. He was in Birmingham driving up. I think he thought it was for a friendly chat. I expressed concern and said I hadn’t seen her for a couple of days. He rang me back. He tried to contact her and told me to ring the police.

'He said she’d been depressed at the weekend. I don’t think people can believe it - especially when we didn’t know what her real name was. Maybe she was running away from something and changed everything. It’s a mystery and just so sad.'

Ron Charnley, 82, another neighbour said: 'There didn’t seem anything at all to be worried about. I would see her pop out in the car and walk down here. She was very slim and tall and quite attractive. She was no shrinking violet. I believe her dad lived out of the area and he used to come up now and again when Mary lived here.

'We heard all the commotion. There were two paramedics cars, an ambulance, two police cars and a police van. I’ve lived here 38 years and it’s always been a very nice estate.

'When Mary died Sam moved in. She’s had a lot of work done on the house. It seemed very much like she was preparing for the future. she wasn’t selling. As far as we were concerned she was there for life. I believe her dad is a spiritualist. Involved in the church.'

Mr Charnley’s wife Doreen said: 'I’m flabbergasted by the whole thing. Things like that don’t happen around here.'

Another neighbour said: 'People knew she was from Devon but all thought she was called Sam. We never knew she was called Angel. We’re totally baffled as to why that might be.'

Detectives are treating the case as a murder inquiry but say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.

Floral tributes and a blue teddy bear have been left outside the semi-detatched property in the quiet suburban close.

Next door neighbour Graham Aspinall, 57, who has lived on the street for nine years, said: 'I've never seen anything like this happen here before.

'She only moved in next door at the beginning of the year but she was always incredibly pleasant.

'She always had her little boy with her and I'd often see her going out an about. Builders came in to do some work when she first moved in and she sent me a card to apologise for the noise.

'She was always very considerate and seemed like a lovely lady. It's an absolute tragedy to see something like this happen to a young woman and a little baby.'

Another neighbour, Mr Higham, said: 'She was a really lovely lady, she always smiled and waved if you saw her in the street.

'She hadn't lived there very long. All of her family were down south. Her dad would come up every month or so just to make sure she was OK.

'She always seemed really pleasant and even in the last few days she seemed fine.'

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'It's a real tragedy and I feel so sorry for their family.

She hasn't lived here that long so I didn't know her. But it's a tragic thing to see on your doorstep.'

Detective Superintendent Eddie Thistlethwaite, from Lancashire Constabulary, said: 'This is a tragic case.

'It is being treated as a murder inquiry, although we are not looking for anybody else in connection with this incident.

'We are still in the very early stages of this investigation but we are conducting a number of inquiries in order to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the deaths.'

Post-mortem examinations are due to take place to establish the causes of death.
