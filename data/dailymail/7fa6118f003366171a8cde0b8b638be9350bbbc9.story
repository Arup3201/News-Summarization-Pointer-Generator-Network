The leader of the UK Independence Party offered the Tories a deal over Europe yesterday – and made it clear he wants to do business with Boris Johnson not David Cameron.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the Eurosceptic Mayor of London was the kind of Conservative his party can support, saying: ‘He’s the only leading Conservative who stands up and says things many UKIP members agree with.’

Mr Farage told his party’s annual conference in Birmingham a referendum on Britain’s relationship with the European Union is now ‘inevitable’.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage is seeking to capitalise on one in four Tory voters saying they could twitch to back his party

And he said his party, which wants to
 withdraw from the EU, would be prepared to enter negotiations over 
electoral tactics with any Tory leader who offered the public an  in-out
 nationwide vote.

He indicated UKIP may not challenge 
parties that made a promise ‘in blood’ to hold a referendum on Britain’s
 withdrawal from Brussels.

Mr Farage told delegates: ‘If an 
opportunity came which meant we could get this country closer to walking
 through a door marked “UK independence”, it would be silly not at least
 to consider it.’

UKIP has enjoyed a surge in the polls to around 10 per cent, which has seen them pushing the Lib Dems into fourth place.

There are fears among the Tories UKIP
 is successfully leeching away supporters. MP Nigel Mills said 
Conservative MPs were ‘concerned’ about defections, claiming the 
realities of coalition government were ‘not something that goes down 
well with some people’.

Mr Farage continued: ‘All this talk of a deal with the Conservatives hasn’t come from me.

‘It has come from members of the 
Conservative Party saying to David Cameron “Look, the Lib Dems will look
 to do a deal with Labour, and if UKIP are on 10 per cent or more in the
 polls, you must look to do a deal with UKIP”.’

He denied reports he was offering a 
deal under which UKIP would give Conservative candidates a clear run at 
the 2015 election in return for a referendum pledge, promising he would 
not ‘sell short’ the party.

He may not even be willing to accept 
the promise of a referendum, he added, recalling Mr Cameron’s ‘cast-iron
 guarantee’ of a national vote on the Lisbon Treaty before the 2010 
election.

‘There are one or two people in 
politics who make promises and then break them, so I don’t think a 
cast-iron guarantee would satisfy UKIP. At a minimum, it would have to 
be written in blood,’ Mr Farage said. The Prime Minister has indicated 
he would give voters a say on a new relationship with Brussels after the
 next election.

But Mr Farage said this would produce
 ‘the wrong referendum’, because it would not include the option of the 
UK leaving altogether.

He said: ‘The only way we would even 
consider a negotiation of any kind at all would be if an absolute 
promise was made to give this country a full, free and fair referendum, 
so we could decide whether we remain members of the EU or not.’ While 
UKIP does not have any MPs at Westminster most experts believe they will
 perform strongly at the European elections in 2014 and could even 
threaten up to 50 Tory seats in 2015.

Arriving in Birmingham, I saw my first Ukipper near the railway station.

He had plum-coloured trews, a blue blazer, a pound brooch on his lapel and balding suede shoes. Oh, and a splendid pot tummy.

As the bulldog in Tom and Jerry used to say, ‘that’s mah boy!’

Ukip’s leader Nigel Farage would later, in an energetic if brief speech, talk about how he had not endured ‘20 years of hard work, sacrifice and much mockery’ only to ‘sell the party short’ in a possible deal with the Conservatives.

Mr Farage spoke without autocue. His speech was funny, fiery, commendably free of the usual guff from politicians. One of life’s unbridled tonkers, is our Nigel.

But his bruised mention of being mocked was interesting. Why is this party teased? Is it simply because its activists have sometimes tended – if they will permit the gross caricature – to have flapping trousers, wall eyes and a problem keeping their breakfast egg on the fork? Or is it because Ukip questions the Establishment consensus? Prophets are always scorned.

There were no metal detectors on the door. European Council president Hermann van Rompuy missed a chance. He could easily have swanned in with a giant stinkbomb.

Attendance was pretty good but there were none of the normal, smart-suited lobbyists you find at other party conferences, although the Campaign for Real Ale had set up a trestle table. A Ukip merchandise stall was flogging not terribly special jubilee mugs for £19 a go. Blimey!

Nor was there the usual flotsam of protest groups and single-issue campaigners outside the door of the conference, shoutily dispensing leaflets. Perhaps that’s because Ukip is, at heart, still a single-issue campaign itself.

The day began with a welcome from a West Midlands Ukip chap who had trouble with the sound system. A ‘wheeeee!’ went up from the stalls. Hearing aids.

Party president Jeffrey Titford went next. His delivery was so comically wooden, I wondered if it was Harry Enfield under that oiled hairdo.

Mr Titford, who referred to the Prime Minister simply as ‘Cameron’, said that the Lord Mayor of Birmingham had been asked to open the conference but the fella hadn’t turned up.

We heard from ‘the young people’ – they are cherished like fresh conkers. A larky lad with sideburns so long they could have been drainpipes. Two beaudelicious belles: a blonde who could have been starring in a shampoo ad, and an Indian in an amazingly tight skirt. Well, hel-low. An old gent near me smacked his gums.

Former Radio 1 disc jockey Mike Read did a turn, as did Lord Hesketh. He gave us a history lesson and spoke in such a drawl one might have been excused for suspecting he had been at the whisky decanter. Most unfair, I am sure.

Mind you, when pugnacious Godfrey Bloom spoke he said it was the first conference speech he had given when he had not been hungover. Mr Bloom, who is standing against Lord Prescott for the Humberside police commissionership, proposed giving police the right to debag anyone who in future behaved like Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell.

Snortingly unPC, Mr Bloom said that some of the current rules faced by the police were plainly ‘drafted by a committee of the retarded’. Whoaa. He said coppers should stop driving top-of-the-range BMWs and start driving humble Hyundais.

Under him there would be no more traffic cameras, and any officer who arrested a householder for defending his home against burglars would be immediately put on disciplinary procedure. The Tories should come to a deal and give Mr Bloom a free run against Lord Prescott. A straight contest between those two would be tremendous entertainment.

Average age in the audience was probably a good 65 and most of them were blokes. I saw a skull cap, a few tattoos, walking sticks, Union Jack ties, a tartan flat cap and parmesan tinfuls of dandruff.

Mr Farage’s warm-up man was Former TV newsreader Kenneth Kendall. Oh no, hang on, it was former newspaper proprietor Lord Stevens, who has just defected to Ukip from the Tories.

Golly, he was dull. He had been introduced as ‘a giant of Fleet Street’  but ‘crashing bore with too much to say for himself’ might have been more accurate. The crowd wanted Mr Farage, and when he finally wrenched the lectern out of Lord Stevens’s hands, he went off like a rocket.

Smaller government, no to Brussels, no to Trident, off with the Human Rights Act’s head – a Ukip conference is in some ways a rightwinger’s political erotic dream. They certainly cement David Cameron in the centre ground.

The problem is that the activists radiate a quite different culture from that of 21st century’s media commisars. The speeches yesterday were unremittingly, almost exuberantly negative. In their logic and drive they have been impressively correct about Europe, and possibly much else. It’s just hard to see how voting Ukip will bring about anything but an Ed Miliband government of crazed lefties.
