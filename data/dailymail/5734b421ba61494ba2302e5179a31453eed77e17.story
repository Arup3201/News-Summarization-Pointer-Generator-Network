Three Palm Beach County deputies have been disciplined for fawning over rapper 50 Cent while on the job.

Sgt. Craig Laufer and deputies Pamela Gibbs and Yvane Moreland received 'verbal counseling' for what their supervisors described as 'unprofessional' behavior during the rapper's appearance  at the county courthouse earlier this month.

Video shot by The Palm Beach Post shows the officers posing for photos with 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson III, and holding onto his waist.

While the two female deputies put their arms around Jackson's waist, disciplinary reports were given to all three, reports Palm Beach Post.

'During the incident, both (deputies) were seen holding onto Mr. Jackson's waist area and for a period of time Mr. Jackson was holding onto (Deputy) Gibb's around her waist, while walking through the courthouse,' according to their supervisor.

According to the report, Laufer 'placed himself in a position to obtain a photograph with Mr Jackson as he was exiting from the Courtroom.' 

'All parties involved placed themselves in a position of disadvantage by taking on a laize-faire (sic) attitude, due to Mr. Jackson's singing background, thus neglecting their assigned duties to their position,' the supervisor wrote.

'It should be noted all deputies involved were in their class 'B' uniform, thus giving a poor perspective and lack of neutrality on behalf of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.' 

The recommended discipline for the trio was 'verbal couseling.' 

The rapper was in court fighting an arbitrators order - in April he was ordered to pay a Bradenton earphone manufacturer more than $16 million in connection with a failed partnership to produce the entertainer's line of headphones.

50 Cent was ordered to pay Sleek Audio nearly $4.5 million in attorney fees and $11.7 million in damages.

The U.S. District Court in Miami affirmed the award in late March after a three-year legal battle.

Records allege that Jackson, a Sleek partner, stole the designs of over-the-ear headphones he asked the company to conceptualize and manufacture. 

Jackson has been selling headphones of a similar design under the 50-Over line with another manufacturer.
