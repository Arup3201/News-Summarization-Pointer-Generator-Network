Tim Sherwood has hit back at claims Alan Hutton should have seen red for his high tackle on Saido Berahino by insisting referee Jon Moss got his decision spot on.

Hutton sparked a furious reaction from West Bromwich Albion players for planting his studs into the midriff of Berahino, missing a bouncing ball.

A free-kick was awarded West Brom’s way and the pair were booked after coming head-to-head afterwards, with Joleon Lescott particularly angry at Hutton, who is now banned for two matches for his tenth booking of the season.

But Sherwood said: 'I think the referee called it right. I thought he was just going to give him a talking to at first but on reflection he probably got it about right.

'I don’t think it was a dirty game. It’s a local derby and I’m not used to players kissing and cuddling each other.

'It was competitive, but that was always going to be the case. Fans want to see commitment.’ Sherwood also said he did not intend to annoy opposition manager Tony Pulis ahead of their repeat clash at Villa Park in the FA Cup on Saturday by suggesting West Brom needed to up their game.

'I didn’t do it to irritate Tony otherwise I’d have put my gumshield in!’ he laughed.
