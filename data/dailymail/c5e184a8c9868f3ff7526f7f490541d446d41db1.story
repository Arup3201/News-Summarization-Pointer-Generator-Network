A major hunt is underway to find Britain's most prolific petrol thief who has been driving off without paying for fuel for two years after escaping detectives by donning fake number plates and wigs.

Officers have linked the thief to 29 separate incidents in Devon and Cornwall and said the con-artist has made off with thousands of pounds worth of fuel during the spree.

However, thanks to an array of disguises including woolly hats, hoodies and wigs, officers have been unable to identify the offender and aren't even certain if they are a man, a woman or a transvestite.

Police have so far been unable to identify the suspect due to the varying disguises used in each offence. Officers said the offender has regularly used fake number plates and swaps them before and after the crime

Devon and Cornwall Police said witnesses have described the suspect as female in 19 offences, male in seven cases, and 'indistinguishable' in the remaining three.

The only firm lead the force has is the silver Vauxhall Zafira that has been picked up repeatedly on CCTV despite the fraudster using a variety of cloned plates.

The scammer's spree began in September 2012 when the mystery suspect refuelled at an Esso garage in Plymouth, Devon.

Over the following two years, the same offender targeted petrol stations across the South West including at Texaco, Esso and Morrisons and each time made off with between £55 and £85 of free fuel.

Police said the suspect is most likely a woman, but said they can't rule out a male transvestite either.

Detective Constable Zara Payne, who is leading the investigation, said: 'The most frequent report is of a woman, sometimes in long blonde wig, or a short bob-cut wig, or wearing a beanie hat or hoody. 

In some cases the suspect dons a wig, while in others they put on a beanie hat or shield their face with a hoody

Police have released CCTV of the offender in the hope of identifying the thief who started the spree in 2012

'But while the same car has been reported at each of the 29 incidents on a few occasions the victim says they think the driver was a man.

'We're keeping an open mind and seeing as this woman appears to go to great lengths to disguise herself, it may well be her impersonating a man.

'What is very clear is over the past two or more years, this woman has stolen thousands of pounds worth of fuel.

'It's quite possible she hasn't paid a penny for her fuel in the last couple of years.

'She's very brazen about it, sometimes returning to the same location two or three times within a few months.

Police said 29 incidents have been reported, with 19 witnesses describing the thief as a woman, seven describing them as a man and three suggesting the sex is 'indistinguishable'

In each theft, police said the thief takes between £55 and £85 worth of fuel before driving off without paying

'These thefts are not spur of the moment. We know she is going prepared, with a set of disguises which she carries with her in the car.

'We also know she is using cloned number plates, which we believe she is changing shortly before and after each of these thefts.

Police have now released these CCTV images of the suspect in the hope someone will be able to help police in identifying them.

Det. Con Payne added: 'Someone out there knows this woman. She may be boasting about her actions, or they have seen her disguises in a car matching the silver Vauxhall Zafira.

'She clearly has no intention of paying for her fuel, seeing it as something only other people have to do.'

Police have managed to link each of the 29 offences due to the car - a Vauxhall Zafira - being used by the thief

 The thief started the spree in Plymouth, Devon, and has since targeted petrol stations across the South West
