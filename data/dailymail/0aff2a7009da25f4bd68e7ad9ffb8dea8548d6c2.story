A 19-year-old Minnesota woman who had all of her fingers and parts of both her feet amputated after she passed out in front of her house in sub-zero temperatures after a night of drinking last year is on the mend and is re-learning how to do the everyday tasks most people take for granted.

Alyssa Lommel nearly died on the cold December night when she passed out on her front porch - her body temperature when she was discovered by some passersby was only 26 degrees Celsius, which is two degrees colder than the temperature that typically causes a human heart to stop functioning.

Many feared she wouldn't survive.

Re-education: With the help of prosthetic devices, Lommel is re-learning how to do everyday tasks

Support: Lommel has received an outpouring of support since she nearly died after passing out on her porch in subzero temperatures

Amputations: Lommel lost all of her fingers and parts of her feet, which forced her to wear special boots to walk. She no longer uses the boots

'We were all prepared to say goodbye at one point,' Alyssa's mother, Teri Lommel, told KARE11.com.

Four months later, and Alyssa is now putting on her own makeup, sending text messages and showering on her own.

'She can already text faster than Mom,' Lommel's oldest brother, Adam, joked.

In the fall, Lommel even plans to go back to school at the University of Minnesota in Duluth and living on her own.

'Initially I thought, "I'm never going to
 be able to do anything for myself ever again,'" Lommel said. 'Once I 
talked to (her friend Jess) it opened my eyes that I'll be able to do everything. 
She gave me hope for the future.'

Lommel was found passed out on her 
porch at about 9:30 a.m. on December 7 by a woman and her boyfriend who 
happened to drive by her house and noticed she was passed out.

'I saw a girl lying on the stairs and it 
was definitely not normal,' said Ellen Johnson, a lifeguard from Alexandria 
who found Lommel. 'It was the first brutally cold weekend 
we had this winter.'

Johnson
 says when she found Lommel she was wearing a jacket and Ugg boots, but 
no gloves - she says Lommel's hands were three times their normal size.

Johnson then called 911 and Lommel was taken away in an ambulance.

When she finally reached doctors, they thought she was about an hour away from dying.

The
 doctors were forced to cut her arms open to relieve the swelling and 
attempt to get her blood to start circulating again. They also had to 
cut open her stomach to make room for her lungs to expand.

Lommel was dropped off by her friends outside her home in Duluth, Minnesota, after a night of drinking, but she somehow ended up on the porch of her neighbors' house

Frigid weather: Temperatures in Duluth had dipped to -16 to -18, with a -36 wind chill Friday night into Saturday

'I honestly don't remember anything from 
that day,' Lommel said. 'I don't remember going to class, going to work 
or anything. The whole day was kind of wiped out. To be honest, I don't 
want to remember. I just want to move forward.'

Following
 the incident, observers argued that Lommel had no one but herself to 
blame after getting so drunk she passed out - the fact that she is a 
minor only added to the criticism.

'People can say that I was underage 
drinking in college and that's what caused it, but in reality had it 
been a sunny day, I would've woken up and been like, "Oh my gosh, what 
am I doing here,'" Lommel said. 'I just want people to be aware that 
this happens to people all the time, unfortunately. Beware of the cold.'

Dangerous condition: Alyssa Jo suffered severe injuries to her hands and feet from exposure, and her parents say doctors are fighting to save her limbs from amputation

KARE
 cites the Minnesota Department of Health's statistics that show cold 
winter weather was a factor in at least 26 deaths between December 1 and
 the end of February.

Lommel was in a coma for three weeks following the incident. She came out of the coma on Christmas Eve.

'Once I woke up, I thought I felt fine. Granted, some drugs were helping,' Lommel said. 'I was ready to go home.'

When she noticed the scar on her stomach from where doctors had to make an incision she commented 'badass.'

Lommel had come out of the coma, but was unaware that she would need to undergo amputations.

'The hardest part is that we knew and it 
was going to be hard to tell Alyssa," Teri said. "We were three weeks 
ahead of her in processing all the information because of the coma."

Party girl: Police say Lommel attended a party where she and her friends played a drinking game and she consumed at least 10 tequila shots

Premonition: Friday afternoon, Alyssa Jo tweeted that she was planning to have tequila shots that night

On December 30, Lommel's doctor told her what he needed to do.

'This isn't real, this isn't real, this 
isn't real,' Lommel kept repeating until someone eventually turned on 
the TV to break the tension.

After the amputations, Lommel quickly learned that her life had forever changed.

'There was tears shed and it was 
definitely hard, but after a while you realize, "that's just me,'" Lommel said. 'That is how I am. This is the new me.'

But Lommel's recovery had begun - slowly at first.

Uphill battle: Doctors are optimistic that Alyssa Jo would be able to walk normally again once healed, but she still has more surgeries ahead of her and will require prosthetics for her hands

Touch and go: Alyssa Jo's parents, Teri and Jay Lommel (pictured) have set up an online journal offering updates on their daughter's condition, which her mother described as 'wait-and-see'

According to KARE, 'after only being allowed to use a feeding 
tube, she was allowed to eat applesauce. After only being allowed to 
consume thick liquids, she was able to drink a Diet Coke. Each time she 
went to physical therapy, she was able to walk farther.'

After
 she was transferred to a hospital closer to her family, Lommel started 
having breakthroughs in her recovery as she learned how to live life as 
an amputee. The first milestone: Making pudding.

When
 she first attempted to open the package, the powder flew everywhere. 
But after some practice, she was able to figure it out - she used her 
forearms to open the cap on a milk carton and to pour it in with the 
rest of the ingredients.

'That
 was another boost,' Lommel said. It also helped her realize that she 
was now able to make her 'staple macaroni and cheese and 
boxed mashed potatoes dishes.'

'I can do anything if I put my mind to it. It's just different than how I used to,' she said.
