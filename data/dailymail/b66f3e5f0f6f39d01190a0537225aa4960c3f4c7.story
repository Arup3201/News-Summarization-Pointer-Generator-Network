The future of robots is here - and it hints at a world in which nothing can stand in the way of the mechanical bots.

Called Deployable Air-Land Exploration Robot (Daler), the robot adapts to different terrains and changes shape automatically, so it can instantly switch from walking to flying.

It was inspired by the movement of the vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, and could one day be used by search-and-rescue teams.

Daler features a foldable skeleton mechanism covered in fabric that can be used both as wings and as legs, also known as 'whegs'.

‘The issue of how to use robot in multiple terrains is an ongoing question in robotics research,’ said doctoral assistant Ludovic Daler at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne.

The US military is hoping to develop hawk-like drones that can not only scan dangerous locations from the air, but also fly through buildings.

It hopes its new generation of drones will be able to fly up to 45 miles per hour (20 metres per second) while navigating unfamiliar indoor spaces.

And, the military wants the drones to be able to do this without any communication from outside operators, and without relying on GPS. 

The drones are being developed as part of its Fast Lightweight Autonomy (FLA) program, which is currently writing the algorithms to improve their navigation.

According to Darpa, these drones could help military teams patrol dangerous environments, as well as help rescue teams respond to disasters such as earthquakes. 

‘This project aims to design robots for exploration, search-and-rescue, or surveillance applications.

‘Within these contexts, the robots have to deal with very complex terrains, such as semi-collapsed buildings, deep caverns, or forests with a lot of vegetation.’

He added that the majority of current  robots use only one so-called ‘locomotion strategy’, such as rolling, walking, flying, hovering, climbing, swimming, crawling, or jumping.

By using just one range of movements, Mr Daler said existing robots' flexibility and adaptability to different environments is limited.

For example, in a search-and-rescue mission winged robots can quickly fly over extended areas, but, exploring confined environments then becomes challenging.

‘For these reasons, robots capable of both ground and flying-hovering locomotion are well suited to navigate complex environments,’ added Mr Daler.

He calls this approach ‘adaptive morphology’, in which parts of the robot are shared between the different forms of movement.

This approach also means the robot can self-adjust to adapt to which movement it needs to use.

Daler was inspired by the movement of the vampire bat (pictured). The designers hope their adaptive robotic ‘bat’ could be used to find victims in dangerous areas after a natural disaster by being remotely deployed to fly to an affected area, before walking through the rubble to search for victims

Mr Daler hopes his adaptive ‘bat’ could be used to find victims in dangerous areas after a natural disaster by being remotely deployed to fly to an affected area, for example.

It would then be able to walk through a disaster zone to locate victims, meaning human rescue teams can concentrate their efforts in other areas.

Future development of the Daler will include the possibility to hover and to take off autonomously from the ground so the robot can return after a mission. 

The researchers are also hoping to make adaptive deployable wings that will improve the mobility of existing flying robots.

Wing shapes could be modified to increase the efficiency of forward flight, hover flight, and landing.  

Scary? The strange snake-legged robot could one day help save lives in disaster zones

It walks, crawls, kicks ... and looks like the stuff of sci-fi nightmares.

But the terrifyingly named 'Snake Monster' may in fact be bringing robotic rescue workers closer to reality.

Scientists hope that research into the six-legged machine will enable robots to become more responsive to their surroundings and move more intuitively, much like living animals.

The walking robot owes its name to the snake-like limbs it uses to skillfully manoeuvre its surroundings.

In the long-term, scientists hope these machines could be used for urban search and rescue, archaeological exploration and, thanks to the robots' ability to move through pipes, inspection of power plants, refineries and sewers.

Carnegie Mellon's Biorobotics Lab developed the mechanics over six months and it is just one example of a robot that could one day be built using a modular system.

Researchers are already working on other modules such as force-sensing feet, wheels and tank-like treads that will make it easier to create totally different machines adapted for different environments.

'By creating a system that can be readily reconfigured and that also is easy to program, we believe we can build robots that are not only robust and flexible, but also inexpensive,' said Professor Howie Choset, who led the research.

Experts said current robots that only have one movement are limited. They call their new approach ‘adaptive morphology’, in which parts of the robot are shared between the different forms of movement (pictured). This approach also means the robot can self-adjust to adapt to which movement it needs to use
