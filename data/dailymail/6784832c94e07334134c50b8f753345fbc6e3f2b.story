The U.S. has ordered diplomats' families and non-essential staff to leave its embassies in Sudan and Tunisia as protests against an anti-Muslim video continue to rage across the Islamic world.

American citizens have also been warned not to visit either country due to the dangers posed by anti-U.S. riots.

The announcements came as the Libyan government revealed that Al Qaeda might have been responsible for the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that killed the American ambassador and three others.

The terrorist network has urged Muslims around the world to step up their protests and kill more diplomats in Islamic countries.

'Given the security situation in Tunis and Khartoum, the State Department has ordered the departure of all family members and non-emergency personnel from both posts, and issued parallel travel warnings to American citizens,' a U.S. government spokesman said on Saturday.

In Tunisia, the warning advised Americans that the international airport in Tunis is open and encouraged all U.S. citizens to depart on commercial flights. It said Americans who chose to remain in Tunisia should use extreme caution and avoid demonstrations.

On Friday, protesters climbed the walls into the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, torching cars in the parking lot, trashing the entrance building and setting fire to a gym and a neighboring American school that is now unusable.

In Sudan, the warning said that while the Sudanese government has taken steps to limit the activities of terrorist groups, some remain and have threatened to attack Western interests

The terrorist threat level remains 
'critical' throughout Sudan. The department noted that U.S. officials 
are already required to travel in armored vehicles and to get permission
 to travel outside Khartoum, where crowds torched part of the German 
Embassy and tried to storm the U.S. Embassy on Friday.

A U.S. official said on Saturday that Sudan's government is holding up the deployment of an elite Marine team that the U.S. planned to send to Khartoum to boost security at the embassy.

The head of Libya's national congress told al-Jazeera that Tuesday night's attack which killed U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens was the work of Al Qaeda.

'If you take into account the weapons used, like RPGs and other heavy weapons, it proves that it was preplanned,' Mohamed Al Magarief said. 'It's a dirty act of revenge that has nothing to do with religion.'

But in Egypt, the prime minister claimed that far from all being radical jihadists, some protesters admitted they had been paid to attend demonstrations.

Some members of Congress have hit out at the billions in aid paid to Arab countries, arguing that countries with populations hostile to the U.S. should not benefit from American funding.

'Our Treasury is bare,' said Kentucky senator Rand Paul. 'There is a multitude of reasons why we should not continue to send good money after bad.'

Al Qaeda made its bloodthirsty appeal to Muslims as riot police clashed 
with around 200 protesters at the U.S. Consulate in Sydney on Saturday whilie demonstrations against the anti-Islam film 'Innocence of Muslims' spread across the world.

The Al Qaeda statement said; 'Whoever comes across America's ambassadors or emissaries should follow the example of Omar al-Mukhtar's descendants [Libyans], who killed the American ambassador,' the group said.

'Let the step of 
kicking out the embassies be a step towards liberating Muslim countries 
from the American hegemony,' a statement posted on an AQAP website on Saturday said.

In Australia, Ten Network television 
news showed a policeman knocked unconscious as the mostly male crowd 
hurled bottles and other missiles. Many of the protesters were wearing 
Muslim dress.

Police used pepper spray against
 the protesters, who chanted 'Obama, Obama, we love Osama' and waved 
placards saying 'Behead all those who insult the Prophet.'

Fury about the 
film swept across the Middle East after Friday prayers, with protesters 
attacking U.S. embassies and in protests that killed at least seven 
people and prompted Washington to send troops to bolster security at its
 missions.

'The film 
published in America which insults our Prophet Mohammad, peace be upon 
him, comes as part of the continuing crusader wars against Islam,' 
AQAP's statement said, referring to European wars in the region some 
1,000 years ago.

Al-Qaeda
 in the Arabian Peninsula is a group of militants mainly from Yemen and 
Saudi Arabia, andÂ  is regarded by the United States as the most 
dangerous branch of the network founded by Osama bin Laden.

The
 group has used Yemen, a key regional U.S. ally, to plot attacks on the 
United States. Washington has backed a Yemeni army campaign that drove 
al Qaeda and its allies from their southern stronghold this year.

Muslims
 have blamed the U.S. government for the amateurish film of obscure 
origin. Washington has condemned the film and said it does not condone 
any insult to any religion.

Praising the 
attacks by angry demonstrators in Libya, Egypt, Yemen and Sudan on U.S. 
and other Western missions as 'natural responses to a huge insult', the 
statement said that American embassies should be burned and diplomats 
killed.

It said defending the Prophet's honor was a 'religious duty and obligation to the Muslim nation, each according to his ability'.

The group also said that Muslims living in the West have an extra duty to be involved in attacks on key targets.

'They are more capable of doing harm and reaching the enemy is easier for them,' it said.

Impoverished Yemen is struggling against challenges on many fronts since mass protests forced president Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down last year after decades in power.

The United States, eager to help the country recover from the upheaval that has pushed it to the brink of collapse, has said it would provide $345 million in security, humanitarian and development aid this year, more than double last year.

A
 total of six police officers were injured, including two who were taken
 to a hospital. Two protesters were treated for police dog bites and 17 
others for the effects of pepper spray, police said in a statement. 
There were no details of their condition.

In Australia, eight people were arrested on charges including assaulting police and resisting arrest.

Police said they were unsure who organized the protest.

'There
 was little or no organization or control of what they were doing, and 
their actions were disgraceful,' police Superintendent Mark Walton said 
in a statement.

Prime Minister Julian Gillard said the protest was unacceptable.

'Violent protest is never acceptable - not today, not ever,' she said in a statement.

Several hundred people took to the streets of Sydney on Saturday, throwing rocks and bottles during clashes with police.

The demonstration that began with about 200 people outside the U.S. consulate in Sydney swelled to more than twice that number, with protesters appearing to catch police off guard as they marched through the centre of the city.

Several streets, usually thronging with weekend shoppers, were blocked off by police as the protest grew.

Police, many wearing anti-riot equipment and some on horseback, used dogs and chemical sprays, including tear gas, as they tried to control the protest.

Television pictures showed one policeman with a head injury being led away by colleagues.

A spokesman for paramedics said there were no serious injuries.

A police spokesman said the protest was being monitored, with demonstrators gathering in a central Sydney park.

A Muslim leader addressed the protesters in the park, calling for calm.

Australia, a staunch U.S. ally with troops still fighting in Afghanistan, has a Muslim population of about 476,000, or 2.2 percent of the population, according to 2011 census figures.

The violent protests in Australia follow four days of demonstrations across the Arab world, stretching from Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Lebanon, Palestinian territories, Israel, Sudan, Nigeria, Tunisia and Pakistan.
