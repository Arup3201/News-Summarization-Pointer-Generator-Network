A Pennsylvania father and former Little League coach is being hailed a hero for wrestling to the ground a crazed gunman moments after the man allegedly shot dead three people at a city planning meeting on Monday night.

Bernie Kozen was pictured today talking to sheriff's deputies as the victims authorities say were killed by scorned resident Rockne Newell, 59, were identified as Chestnuthill Township Supervisor David Fleetwood, Gerard Kozic, 53, of Saylorsburg and James LaGuardia, 64, of Saylorsburg.

Newell is accused of shouting 'You took my property, ****suckers!' before opening fire on the monthly Ross Township municipal meeting after feuding with the city over living conditions at his home. He was charged with three counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated assault on Tuesday.

Hero: Bernie Kozen, pictured near the shooting scene on Tuesday, August. 6, 2013, wrestled the gunman to the ground

Tragic: The three victims were killed on Monday night at the Ross Township Municipal Building, in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania

Kozen told The Pocono Record he
was helping one of the men injured in the spray of bullets when Newell 
'walked by me into the meeting room, I guess to shoot more people.'

He recounted the gunman shouting: 'You took my property, ****suckers!'

At
that moment, Kozen courageously pounced on the shooter and tackled him 
to the floor before using Newell's own weapon to shoot him twice in the 
leg.

'I came up behind him 
and wrestled the gun from him,' Kozen told the newspaper, adding that he
had the help of another brave witness.

Witness Cleoria Campodonico described the horror inside the usually dry meeting.

Victim: Chestnuthill Township Supervisor David Fleetwood, pictured, was among the three men killed

'I'll never get those images out of my 
head. Those poor, innocent people,' she said. 'David Fleetwood pushed me
out of the way and got shot twice in the belly.'

Fleetwood was as a man you could count on, his friends said on Tuesday.

'He'd
give you the shirt off his back,' Township Manager Dave Albright told 
The Record, choking back tears. 'He'd do anything for you. Just in the 
things that he did here at the township but also as a friend.'

Gerard Kozic's wife, Linda, and Frank Pirano Jr. were also injured in the shock shooting.

Newell had reportedly been in an ongoing dispute with the city about a junkyard on his property.

'I heard more than 10 shots,' said The Pocono Record reporter Chris Reber, who was at the meeting.

'It was automatic, like a string of firecrackers.'

State
police said about 15 to 18 residents and town officials were at the 
building, a short drive from Newell's property, when the gunfire erupted
at around 7:19 p.m.

Two people died at the scene, and a third person died after being flown to a hospital.

A woman, presumably Mrs Kozic, was undergoing surgery late Monday. 

One person was shot 
in the leg, two were shot in the stomach and one was shot in the head, 
according to the Pocono Record.

Investigators said Newell began shooting as he approached the building and continued as he walked into and through it.

He
then went back out to his vehicle in the parking lot, retrieved a 
handgun and returned to the building, firing more shots, police said.

Reber said the gunman, armed with a long gun with a scope, shot through a wall into the meeting.

'The thing that got my attention: 
plaster flying out, blowing out through the walls. Witnesses would later
tell me they saw pictures exploding away from the walls,' Reber said on Monday evening.

He said he crawled out to a hallway, exited the building and took cover behind a vehicle.

'The gunman was this guy wearing a 
blue Hawaiian shirt,' he said. 'I saw him go back out to his car, a 
silver Impala, and get another gun.

'It wasn't real to me until I went back inside and saw people bleeding.'

Reber was the first to flag up Kozen's heroics.

'Bernie Kozen was there tending to the man and he 
(the shooter) didn't see them,' he explained.

'Bernie bearhugged him 
and took him down. He shot him with his own gun.'

Rep. Matt Cartwright, who represents the state's 17th District Cartwright called Kozen a 'true hero.'

When asked at his arraignment on 
Tuesday whether he owns any property, Newell said: 'They stole it from 
me. That's what started all this.'

Disrepair: Newell's property was compared to a junkyard in local media reports about his feud with officials

Search: The home of alleged shooter 59-year-old Rockne Newell is seen early Tuesday, August 6, 2013 in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania

He then asked if he'll get any medical attention.

'I
got a .44 slug on my leg. Hospital says its still in there. They gave 
me no pain medication and sent me on my way. I'm bleeding all over the 
place,' he said.

Newell had been in a long-running 
dispute with township officials over the dilapidated condition of his 
property, state police Capt. Edward Hoke said.

The township supervisors voted in 
February 2012 to take legal action against Newell for violating zoning 
and sewer regulations, according to meeting minutes posted online.

Last October, Newell set up a 
fundraising page online and was trying to raise $10,000 to pay for legal
fees in his battle with the township.

'Ross township took me to court & 
the court ruled I have to vacate my home of 20 years,' he wrote on the 
page called saveRockyshome. 'I live on SSI which comes to $600 a month I
have no money to clean it up.'

Newell said his two rescue dogs 'will be put to sleep because no one else will take them.'

The property includes an old camper in
the front yard filled with wooden pallets, pieces of what appear to be 
old railroad ties and trash. A garage leans and appears close to 
collapse, and a propane tank sits inside an old dog house.

State police, who guarded the property early Tuesday, were awaiting a search warrant so they can enter it.

In June, the Pocono Record wrote a 
story about what it said was an 18-year fight between the township and 
Newell over his property.

Monroe
County Court in August 2012 sided with the township and ordered Newell 
to vacate and never again occupy or use the property unless he had the 
permits to do so.

The report said Newell had been living out of a car, a 1984 Pontiac Fiero, and in abandoned buildings since being ordered to vacate.

Newell told the paper he was unemployed for years after an injury from a crash and had nowhere else to go.

'They have no right to kick me off my property,' he told the newspaper. 'They call my property an eyesore. When I bought it, it was one of only three properties on the entire road that didn't have what they call junk.'

Newell was in police custody after being treated at the hospital Monday night.

Ross Township has about 5,500 residents

Newell told the Record this past June he couldn’t afford the septic hookup fees, and eerily complained about his perceived treatment.

'If I lose this property, I have nowhere else to go,' said Newell, adding 'what they're doing to me, what they've been doing to me for so long, it's wrong.'

Authorities have yet to bring charges against Newell but are holding him while his property is searched. He has been released from hospital where he was treated for gunshot wounds to the leg.
