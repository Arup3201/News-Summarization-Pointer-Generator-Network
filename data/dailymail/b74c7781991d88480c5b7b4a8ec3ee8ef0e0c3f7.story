A teacher who was critically injured when a rock was dropped on her family's car from a Pennsylvania overpass has made 'amazing' strides, her husband said.

Sharon Budd, from Ohio, is taking steps, talking in short sentences, eating soft foods and writing and drawing, said Randy Budd.

'It's absolutely amazing how far she has come from this horrific, senseless, violent crime,' Mr Budd said.

'She continues to amaze the doctors and nurses. In fact, they call her the miracle child,' he told the Akron Beacon Journal.

The 52-year-old teacher from Uniontown had a setback this week when she suffered a seizure from which she continues to recover. 

Her family nevertheless is hopeful she will leave the rehabilitation hospital in Pennsylvania within a few weeks.

Mrs Budd, of Uniontown, suffered severe head injuries when the football-sized rock crashed through the windshield of the family's car on July 10 during a trip to New York.

The teacher, a passenger in the vehicle driven by her daughter, had just finished speaking to her son, who was about to be deployed to Afghanistan with the military.

The rock was dropped from an Interstate 80 overpass near Danville, Pennsylvania. 

Mrs Budd has undergone multiple surgeries, including removal of a portion of her facial bones to ease the brain swelling. 

Complications forced surgeons to remove a portion of her right frontal brain, her husband said. 

She also lost the use of her right eye.
