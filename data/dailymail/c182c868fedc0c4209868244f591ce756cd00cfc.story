Norwegian gunman Anders Behring Breivik used dum-dum bullets - which explode inside the body and often kill their targets instantly - on his deadly rampage around the idyllic holiday island of Utoya.

The revelation by a surgeon comes as these incredible photographs emerge of children using mattresses to barricade themselves into their rooms.

Eyewitnesses have described how the mass-murderer was 'calm and collected' during his spree, and and explained how they pretended to play dead to escape death.

Terrified victims, aged between 15 and
 25, hid in buildings, crouched behind trees and lay among dead bodies. Others pretended to be dead 
while some dived into freezing waters to escape Utoya island, north west of Oslo.

One young couple even hid in a freezer
 for two hours while frantically trying to contact friends and family. 
Other witnesses said Breivik 'shot the cutest girl first' and would laugh and shout during the killing spree.

Erlend Fosseida Selre, 19, said he was
 watching TV coverage of the bombing in the country's capital, Oslo, 
when the shooting started.

'We could hear shots and speaking from the floor outside. We thought it was the gunman walking around.

'We decided to stay until someone came to open the door, and prayed it would not be the gunman,' he told the Sunday Telegraph.

Survivor Prableen Kaur, the deputy 
leader of the AUF, the ruling Labour party's youth wing, said she was 
talking to friends when she heard the first shots and immediately texted
 her mum to say she was OK.

And the chief surgeon at a hospital treating victims of Norway's camp massacre said the killer used special bullets designed to disintegrate inside the body and cause maximum internal damage.

Dr Colin Poole, head of surgery at Ringriket Hospital in Honefoss north west of Oslo, said surgeons treating 16 gunshot victims have recovered no full bullets.

He said: 'These bullets more or less exploded inside the body. These bullets inflicted internal damage that's absolutely horrible.'

Ballistics experts say so-called dum-dum bullets also are lighter in weight and can be fired with greater accuracy over varying distances.

They commonly are used by air marshals on aeroplanes and hunters of small animals.

Poole, a surgeon for 26 years at the hospital, said the bullets were 'hyper-fragmentable' and produced confusing pictures on X-rays.

'It's caused us all kinds of extra problems in dealing with the wounds they cause, with very strange trajectories. The effect they cause inside the body is like a thousand pin pricks.'

At first a number of people thought it
 was a joke but soon realised the reality of the situation when Breivik 
began chasing his victims down.

Miss Kaur said the killer shot a 
number of people around her. Desperate to live, she pretended she was 
dead and lay ontop of another body for more than an hour.

Eventually a local man with a tiny 
boat came to her rescue and she was taken to the mainland where she was 
able to ring her mother.

'I'm still in shock. I have seen the corpses of my friends and several of my friends are missing.

'I am glad I am alive. This summer's most beautiful fairy tale is transformed into Norway's worst nightmare.'

Adrian Pracon, one of the organisers 
of the political summer camp, was working in the information booth when 
the massacre took place.

The
 21-year-old, who was shot in the back as he pretended to play dead, 
said people had thought the gunman, dressed in police uniform, was there
 to help.

He also described how he would shoot
 to kill, carefully pulling the trigger, and said the blond-haired 
gunman looked as though he was straight out of a 'Nazi movie'.

'The
 man started walking towards the camp and people ran up to him to ask 
him what was going on. They head heard what had happened further down 
the hill, but the man he brought out a gun and he shot four people,' 
said Mr Pracon.

'They came to him for help and he just shot them. It's unbelievable that something like this could happen.'

Mr Pracon described how the 32-year-old right wing extremist knew his victims had little chance of escape and would check bodies for any signs of life, kicking them as he moved along.

'He then started looking for people and followed them into their tents, he kept shooting them inside their tents and they had nowhere to hide.

'There were 20 to 30 people died in the water, I saw a couple of people being shot and the weapon was so powerful. The jet of the water was huge and became red,' he said.

Desperate to escape he hid behind the dead bodies and lay there before he heard Breivik coming.

'Luckily I was lying down but people were falling about me. Around my legs, behind me and in the front of me so I hid behind them. I stayed completely still and did not want to show the gunman any sign of life.

'He walked towards me, over dead bodies that were lying around me, I heard his shoes walking and felt his breath.

'He was calm and collective, he was not in a hurry to press the trigger quickly and if people ran, he knew he would catch them, no problem,' Mr Pracon told the BBC.

Before he was shot Mr Pracon said he had tried to escape the island by swimming into the ocean but only managed a short distance before deciding to turn back. He was then shot in the shoulder as he tried to pretend he was dead.

Now, recovering in hospital, he said: 'I heard a loud band and a high pitched sound in my ear and after that it lasted until I went to the hospital.'
