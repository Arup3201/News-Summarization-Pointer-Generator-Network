Prawn lovers face paying much higher prices this Christmas because of a global shortage. 

Stocks of cold-water prawns have plunged and wholesale prices have risen 40 per cent in recent weeks.

This is partly due to cold weather in Canada and Greenland earlier in the year, which hindered trawlers, and follows a huge reduction in catches over the past three years.

Experts warn prices will continue to rise for several months.

Randall Jennings, managing director of supplier Royal Greenland, said his firm is unable to accept any more orders for prawns due to the crisis.

‘This is an industry-wide problem affecting all suppliers,’ he said.

‘All stocks in the market are very low and prices are increasing rapidly.

'We are doing all we can to fulfil current orders and to prevent a situation like this occurring again. 

'Reduced fishing should help to protect future stock, and we are actively looking to increase our access to North Atlantic stock and processing facilities to help us avoid being in this situation again.'
