Mixing things up: with Christmas fast approaching Swap Force is sure to be on most people's wish lists

Great fun: there are loads of new abilities in the characters - such as flying and bouncing

Stunning: When played in HD, the game creates an impressive world

Go it alone: as well as the single-player campaign, Battle modes let you take on waves of enemies until you die

Also worth a mention... Disney Infinity: Toy Story In Space

Also out now is the latest playset for the brilliant Disney Infinity game. Although many will be disappointed that it's not a 'old-school' classic, such as Aladdin, there's still plenty here for Toy Story fans to enjoy. 

Most of the game is spent saving aliens from a variety of natural disasters, flying around as Buzz Lightyear and shrinking or growing things with a nifty goo gun. You even get to create your on Star Command, a move sure to please die-hard fans.

Add to the mix solid visuals and some laugh-out-loud moments (notably from the man voicing Rex, Wallace Shawn) and it's a solid entry in the franchise, if only leaving fans wanting more.
