Sam Warburton has been told he must step up as captain when he leads Wales into the autumn Tests and next year’s World Cup.

Warburton will equal Ieuan Evans as the second longest-serving Wales skipper when he wears the armband for the 28th time, against Australia on November 8. Only Ryan Jones (33) has done the job more times.

Yet despite having emerged as the face of a brave new side that reached the semi-finals of the World Cup three years ago, he must also now be its voice.

Warburton admits the role has not come naturally and he has gone about his job with the same methodical calmness as childhood hero Jonny Wilkinson. 

He has led by actions rather than words but Wales coach Warren Gatland, who has worked with legendary leaders Lawrence Dallaglio, Brian O’Driscoll and Paul O’Connell, believes the next 12 months present a significant test of Warburton’s calibre.

He said: ‘For Sam, the challenge now is taking the next step as a captain. He has had that experience from 2011 and done it for the Lions. He has established himself in that role for us in his own quiet way.

Cool, calm and collected, Warburton admits the captaincy role has not come naturally to him 

‘But players and captains go through stages and we are looking for him to be more vocal and demanding within the squad. He has some great leaders around him, in guys like Alun Wyn Jones, who did a fantastic job for us in South Africa when Sam was injured.

‘But it is important for those leaders to be vocal and have an input for the squad to work effectively. It has been a criticism that we have been too quiet and senior players have not voiced enough of themselves.’

Wales face New Zealand, Australia and South Africa next month and Gatland estimates that they have ‘thrown away’ six wins over the Southern Hemisphere nations in the last four years alone.

Most recently, Wales let slip a 12-point lead in the final nine minutes against the Springboks in June and Gatland said: ‘Those are the moments when you need your senior players to speak up. 

'We have made poor decisions in the last few minutes of games we should have won. So we will spend time watching the videos, recreating those scenarios and making sure we make better decisions under pressure.’
