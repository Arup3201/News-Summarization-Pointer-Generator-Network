Moseley had performed as a backing dancer for Chris Brown and on Monday he posted a tribute to her

Burrel Wilks, Hayes’ life coach and close friend, described the married couple as long-time partners who were in the process of breaking up, reports KTLA.

'I've had sit downs with both of them so whatever happened behind those doors we'll never know, but I heard out of her own mouth, he never raised a hand on her so this is kind of stunning,' he said.

Moseley played ‘Devil Girl/Arelly’ in Hit The Floor, the VH1 drama series about an NBA cheerleading team called the Los Angeles Devil Girls.

She had also appeared in movies including The Twlight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1, Mirror Mirror and Sparkle and as a backing dancer for singers including Janet Jackson, Chris Brown and Britney Spears.

On Monday, Brown posted a tribute to Moseley on Instagram. 'RIP baby girl. Danced with me on tour and was always the coolest person. My prayers go out to you and HAZE family,' he wrote.
