Sture Bergwall relished his reputation as 'Sweden's answer to Hannibal Lecter' and would happily regale anyone in ear shot with stories of murder, mutilation, rape and cannibalism.

His tales of how he strangled, stabbed, defiled and mutilated more than 30 victims over three decades, captivated and horrified his homeland in equal measure, cementing his standing as the country's most prolific and deranged serial killer.

But then, 23 years after he was locked up in a remote psychiatric hospital, he made his most staggering confession of all: that he had made it all up.

And yesterday all charges against the 
63-year-old were dropped, in a legal first that has cast a dark shadow over 
Sweden's judicial system.

How was he convicted? Yesterday, 23 years after he was locked up in Sweden's most secure psychiatric hospital, all charges against the 63-year-old were dropped, in a legal first that has cast a shadow over Sweden's judicial process

Unexplained: Bergwall claimed he killed 17-year-old Norwegian Trine Jensen, left, in 1981, and strangled female prostitute Gry Storvik, right, in 1985

'I've killed': It was during a series of therapy sessions in the psychiatric hospital that he realised for the first time how to make people sit up and take an interest in him

Psychiatric officials will now 
evaluate whether Bergwall can be released from the secure mental health 
unit where he's been held since 1991.

Of
 the 30 murders Bergwall confessed to, he was convicted of eight. But he
 later said he had lied to investigators because he craved attention and
 was heavily medicated.

His claimed victims were all of different ages, different sexes and from different backgrounds.

His methods varied too. Some he 
claimed he stabbed, others he strangled and one he beat to death with a 
rock. Some he said he raped, others he chopped up and one he even 
claimed to have eaten.

But what was constant throughout all 
his gruesome confessions was the detail with which he described the 
murders: how he killed them, where he killed them, even their last 
words.

Faces of a serial killer? Sture Bergwall relished telling the world how he strangled, stabbed, defiled and mutilated more than 30 victims over three decades, thus cementing his reputation as the country's most prolific and deranged serial killer

1976, Charles Zelmanovits, 15

He claimed to have picked the teenager up in his car by the side of a road. After persuading him to engage in a sexual act he said he strangled him, abused the body and cut it up with a saw in nearby woods. He said he took a leg as a souvenir.

1980, Johan Asplund, 11

He spotted Aspland by the side of a 
road and asked to check if he had run over a cat. When the boy bent over
 he smashed his head against the door and dragged him into his car. He 
drove the boy into the countryside, where he sexually assaulted then 
strangled him. He buried some of the organs, put the hands on the car's 
front seat, the head, legs and torso in plastic bags. He said what he 
didn't throw out of the window he took home and ate.

1981, Trine Jensen, 17

After beating and raping her he said he strangled her with the strap of her handbag

1984, Marinus and Janny Stegehuis

The Dutch couple were on a camping holiday. He said he stabbed the husband through the tent canvas and clambered inside. He described the attack in extraordinary detail, accurately numbering hoa many times each victim was stabbed.

1985, Gry Storvik, 23

He made the Norwegian female prostitute strip before he tortured her, and he described how she vomited as he strangled her.

1988, Israeli student, Yenon Levi, 24

He said he and an accomplice took the tourists, who was seeing relatives, to a holiday home in the woods and killed him when he tried to escape.

1988, Therese Johannesen, nine

The Norwegian girl was waiting at a bus shelter for a downpour to end when he pulled her down a slope and bashed her head against a rock. he later told how disappointed he was that she was not a boy. He said her last words were: Mummy, mummy.' he then dismembered and buried her, returning a year later to burn the remains. Police later found a bone fragment that matched that of a young girl that appeared to have been cut by a sharp instrument in the spot he identified.

He managed to hoodwink judges, psychiatrists, journalists and the Swedish public. Until in 1998 he decided enough was enough.

'I had burned so many bridges [in my life], and I was plunged into this profound loneliness,' he told GQ magazine. 'I wanted to be this interesting person. I didn’t want to be this gray bad person. I wanted to be something else.'

His near forensic knowledge of many
 of the murders convinced detectives and prosecutors that he must
 have committed the crimes.

Nobody bothered to find out that he had studied the killings during regular trips to a local library on day trips from the asylum.

Bergwall, a convicted sex offender and
 bank robber who at the time had changed his name to Thomas Quick, had already been locked up in the Sater hospital for a botched bank robbery.

It was there, during a series of therapy sessions which he says were so uninteresting that he felt a failure even at that, that he realised for the first time how to make people sit up and take notice of him.

He told GQ how his heavily-pregnant mother had walked in on his father sexually abusing him at the age of ten, the therapist's interest seemed to spark up.

Such was the shock at what his mother had seen, he claimed, that she miscarried the baby onto the bedroom floor.

He told how the next day his father took him to bury the dead foetus in nearby woodland. As the therapist listened intently to his tale, for the first time he felt important.

And within weeks he was telling staff he was behind one of Sweden's most famous unsolved murders - that of 11-year-old Johan Asplund whose torso alone was found in 1980.

As the months drew on he confessed to a host of other murders including that of a 15-year-old boy in 1976; a 17-year-old girl in 1981; Dutch husband and wife in 1984; a 23-year-old female prostitute in 1985; and an Israeli student and a 9-year-old Norwegian girl in 1988.

Of those eight murders he was convicted, despite claims of a lack of real evidence.

Retrials were ordered in each case, but prosecutors said that without the confessions they didn't have enough evidence to go back to court. On Wednesday they dropped the final case, which involved the death of 15-year-old boy who disappeared in northern Sweden in 1976.

Bergwall was convicted in 1994 of murdering the boy, even though there was no technical evidence linking him to the crime and the cause of death could not be established.

The lack of evidence to support the 
confessions led to some doubts over Bergwall's guilt, but a 2006 review 
by Sweden's chancellor of justice found no problems with the 
convictions.

Two years later Bergwall recanted in a
 Swedish TV documentary, saying he had fabricated the story of Thomas 
Quick the serial killer. He now claims it was a cry for attention, 
fueled by heavy medication.

'If I hadn't accepted therapy and 
benzodiazepines, no Thomas Quick would have been created,' Bergwall told
 AP. 'In that lies the guilt that I must carry to my grave with respect 
to the relatives of the victims, their suffering during the Thomas Quick
 years.'

'That a person has been convicted of 
eight murders and later been declared innocent, that is unique in 
Swedish legal history,' attorney general Anders Perklev told reporters 
in Stockholm. 'It has to be considered as a big failure for the justice 
system.'

By telephone from the Sater psychiatric unit, Bergwall called the decision to drop the final charges 'overwhelming and emotional,' and called for an investigation into how the justice system has handled his case.

'The next step is that I, with my lawyers, take actions for my release,' he told The Associated Press.

Sven-Erik Alhem, a Swedish legal expert who was not involved with the case, called it Sweden's 'greatest miscarriage of justice in modern times.' He said it was particularly painful for the families of the victims, who are unlikely to ever find out the truth of what happened to their loved ones.

With Bergwall's confessions withdrawn, there are no longer any strong links between the eight deaths, and it's not even clear that all were homicides. In two cases no bodies were found.
