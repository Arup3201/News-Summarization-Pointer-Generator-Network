Ministers attempting to crack down on civil servants’ perks have hit an unexpected barrier – the Queen.

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude wanted to cut the two-and-a-half ‘privilege’ days that staff get on top of their 30 days’ annual leave and bank holidays.

But The Mail on Sunday has been told the plan was altered after it was discovered one of the days had been personally granted to the Civil Service by the Queen on her Coronation 60 years ago.

Decisive: A Whitehall source said plans to cut the holiday allowance were quashed when the Palace reportedly indicated it would be very difficult

A Whitehall source said the reform had been defeated by a combination of constitutional law and the threat of compensation claims from the Civil Service.

He added: ‘Soundings from the Palace were that this would be very difficult and might involve a Royal Charter.’

The Cabinet Office said: ‘Civil servants are currently entitled to two-and-a-half privilege days.

It was decided that it was appropriate to make changes to one-and-a-half days, and leave the Queen’s birthday as it is.’

Senior civil servants agreed to forgo 
the one-and-a-half days. But it has now emerged that this time has been 
added to their annual leave.

Austere times: Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Commons Public Administration Committee said privilege days were not acceptable in the current economic climate

One Whitehall source described the move as ‘cooking the books’ to disguise the fact that staff will be keeping their extra holidays. 

Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Commons Public Administration Committee, said: ‘Things like privilege days are at complete variance with the urgency and pace that we require from the Civil Service, particularly in the present economic times.’

A Palace spokesman said that the decision to keep the Queen’s birthday privilege day was ‘entirely’ that of the Cabinet Office. He declined to discuss any talks between officials about the proposal.
