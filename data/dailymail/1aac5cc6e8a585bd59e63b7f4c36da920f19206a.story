These tiny hedgehogs are being given a helping hand after being found by a member of the public who delivered them to the safety of a an animal rescue organisation.

The hoglets, which are just a few days old, are being cared for at Secret World - a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre in East Huntspill, Somerset - until they are big enough to fend for themselves.

Here they were snapped by wildlife photographers Ann and Steve Toon, from Northumberland National Park.

Mr Toon, 51, said: 'We love the character of the hoglets’ wrinkly faces.

'With adult hedgehogs, it’s hard to see much of their faces - you just see a little wet nose and a couple of beady eyes.

'But with these little guys, you can really see their cute character.'

The hoglets measure no more than the length of an index finger.

Mr Toon reckons these hoglets were abandoned, but warned that not all hedgehogs out in thw old on their own have been deserted by their mothers.

Hedgehogs often leave their young alone for hours while they forage or sleep, so babies like these are not always abandoned.

Mr Toon said: 'People should get expert advice before picking up apparently abandoned baby animals.

'A lot of perfectly healthy animals are ‘rescued’ by well-meaning members of the public.

Lunchtime: The hoglets are fed with substitute milk every two hours at the wildlife centre. The hedgehogs, which are just days old, are so small that they are fed via a syringe

Given a hand: After being nurtured back to health Secret World wildlife centre in East Huntspill will release them back in the wild

'With very young hedgehogs like this, it’s now touch and go if they will survive the first few days at the centre.

'But if they do, there’s a very good chance of them eventually being released back into the wild.'

The hedgehogs are fed every couple of hours through the day and night with a substitute milk formula.

They will be released back into the wild once they have reached a big enough weight to survive hibernating an entire winter on their own.
