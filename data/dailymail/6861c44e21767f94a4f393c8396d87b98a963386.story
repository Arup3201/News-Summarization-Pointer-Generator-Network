As Prince Harry was having an early night yesterday to prepare for the launch of the Invictus Games, his ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy was gallivanting around west London with her long-term love Charles Goode.

The blonde lawyer's relationship with the jeweler has been getting increasingly serious over the last few months, with rumours flying in recent weeks that an engagement announcement will soon be made. 

Chelsy, 28, and Charles, 30, spent the second half of August travelling through Zambia, Mozambique, and Malawi on a romantic adventure holiday together.

Outdoor-loving Chelsy joined Charles on fishing trips and treks that included a hike up Mount Mulanje in southern Malawi. 

But despite friends of the couple speculating that the mountain-top setting would be the perfect place for a marriage proposal, Chelsy's ring finger was noticeably bare of sparkle during their outing to the Barr and Bass launch party in Chelsea last night.

It's possible that the link to her ex's older brother's marriage proposal may have put Charles off asking for his girlfriend's hand during their summer holiday. 

Prince William asked Kate Middleton to be his wife during a trip they made to the spartan Rutundu Log Cabins during their Kenyan holiday in 2010. 

Chelsy Davy and Charles Goode arrived at the party fresh from their trip to Africa, where it was widely speculated the jeweler would propose 

But diamond ring or not, the couple looked blissfully happy as they arrived at the bash on the King's Road. 

They weren't the only royal connection in the building - Donna Air, who is in a relationship with the Duchess of Cambridge's brother James was also in attendance. 

Meanwhile, across London Prince Harry was readying himself for a busy few days ahead of the Invictus Games Opening Ceremony tonight at the Olympics Stadium.

The 29-year-old has already admitted to being overwhelmed by the workload that came with hosting the Games, which will see more than 400 war-wounded servicemen and women from 13 nations compete against each other.

The six-day event isn't just sports-heavy; Coldplay are appearing at the concert tonight to perform the official anthem and the Red Arrows are doing a flypast, while the closing ceremony on September 14 will feature performances from James Blunt, the Military Wives Choir and Foo Fighters.

The Games started ahead yesterday, ahead of tonight's Opening Ceremony, with the Prince attending a Reception at the American Ambassador's Residence, Winfield House alongside Foo Fighters front man Dave Grohl. 

Chelsy Davy and her boyfriend Charles Goode both sported a healthy tan from their adventure holiday in Africa 

He said of his sleepless nights over the event's success: 'Of course I'm nervous.

‘There are times when we thought that we’re just never, ever going to get to the finish line. 

'If all the venues sell out, then I’m happy because it’s all about the atmosphere and making these guys feel really special.'

But while the Prince's work schedule has been punishingly busy of late, things have been unusually quiet on the romance front. 

Since splitting from his last serious girlfriend Cressida Bonas in April of this year, Harry has only briefly been linked with a few women, including a PR executive called Sarah Hazen at the Secret Garden Party festival and Halo Trust employee Camilla Thurlow. 

According to sources, he also made a play for Egyptian heiress Enayat Younes after bumping into her in a Spanish nightclub last month.

But so far no one has matched up to his seven-year on-off relationship with Chelsy, who many referred to as the love of his life. 

The Zimbabwean was largely considered to be a match for the the Prince in both personality and temperament, with her strong will enabling her to cope with the attention that comes from dating one of the world's most eligible bachelors.

But the strict rules of living within the British monarchy eventually proved too much for Chelsy. 

Cressida Bonas was Prince Harry's last attempt at a relationship for Prince Harry, but the pair split in April after just over a year together

According to friends, it was Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011 that proved to be the final nail in the coffin for Chelsy's relationship with Harry as she decided she couldn't permanently live the life of a royal.  

The couple remain good friends though and are reported to keep in touch regularly by phone, while their paths also frequently cross at society weddings of friends they share.
