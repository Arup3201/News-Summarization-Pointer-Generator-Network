Wisdom was loaned out to Championship outfit Derby last season as he was unable to break into Liverpool's first team. 

West Brom are also closing in on a £2million deal for Costa Rica right-back Cristian Gamboa.

Hull and Derby have also shown interest in the 24-year-old who plays for Rosenborg, however Albion appear to be winning the race to sign the defender.

West Brom have spent over £10million so far this summer - with the majority of their transfer outlay going on club record signing Brown Ideye.
