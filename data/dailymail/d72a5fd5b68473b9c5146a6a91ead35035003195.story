British mother Paula Reynolds has been ordered to return to Italy with her son by a Family Division judge

After her ex-boyfriend allegedly held a knife to her throat, British mother Paula Reynolds fled Italy and came back to the UK with her young son.

Now, however, a Family Division judge has ruled she must return.

And the 37-year-old has been told she could be arrested and her three-year-old son placed in a state-run children’s home when she arrives in Italy next week.

Miss Reynolds fled to her mother’s home in Bala, North Wales, after claiming she had suffered a catalogue of physical abuse at the hands of her Italian former partner – the father of her child.

But last week, the Family Division of the High Court ruled she must return her son after the Italian authorities applied using controversial child abduction laws under the Hague Convention.

Miss Reynolds said: ‘It’s terrifying as my son could very well be taken away from me while I’m arrested as soon as we land.

‘I left Italy quickly as I needed to be with my family and was terrified that my son would be taken away from me while over there.

‘I believe I’m going to be trapped over in Italy by their courts which will definitely make me stay because I’m a foreigner. I think they won’t even let me visit my family here any more, fearing I’m going to abduct my son.’

Miss Reynolds’ local MP in North Wales, Elfyn Llwyd, said he was ‘desperately worried’ about her case and would be raising it with Nick Clegg at tomorrow’s Deputy Prime Minister’s Questions.

He said: ‘For a child to be handed over to his father while he has domestic violence allegations hanging over him or being placed in an institution is totally unnecessary and potentially very damaging to both the child and mother.’

Miss Reynolds moved to Italy from London to teach English in 2002. The former Manchester University post-graduate met the father of her child, a 40-year-old stonemason, in the Alpine town of Trento in 2009.

A year later their son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was born and they applied for dual nationality, meaning he  has British and Italian passports.

But Miss Reynolds claims the relationship turned sour when her boyfriend strangled and punched her during an argument in their apartment in 2011.

She says that she made a complaint to the police and a civil court banned him from having any contact with her and his son for four months. An Italian youth custody court later granted him a one-hour supervised visiting order for his son once a week.

Miss Reynolds says she had to go to hospital after he became angry at her when he turned up at their apartment and his son did not want to see him.

She claims that he punched her in the face and held a knife to her throat while threatening her last year. Following the allegations, Miss Reynolds applied to an Italian judge to return to her mother’s home. However, she flew back to the UK with her son in September after claiming her ex-boyfriend had assaulted her again.

British police confiscated their passports last month. And following a hearing last week, a High Court judge ruled they should both return to Italy on Monday.

Miss Reynolds added: ‘My son has settled in Wales and is attending nursery here. He has his grandparents, my brother and his children to play with and has been doing really well.

‘I want to settle in the UK with him and have my family-support network, but I fear I cannot because of the Italian courts.’

Her former boyfriend denies attacking her, but it is believed he will face assault charges at an Italian criminal court hearing due to take place later this month.
