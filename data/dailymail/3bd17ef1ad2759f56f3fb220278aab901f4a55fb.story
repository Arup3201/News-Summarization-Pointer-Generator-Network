Google has warned its Glass wearable computer could result in eye strain and headaches - and has banned children from wearing the gadget amid fears it could damage their eyesight.

The search giant also advises people who have had laser eye surgery to check with their doctors.

The warnings come amid growing concern over the safety of looking at the tiny screen all day.

Hackers claim thy can remotely take control of Glass, and see and hear everything a wearer does. Today they called for Google to improve the security on the device before it goes on sale to the public next year

How Google Glass Works

'Glass isn’t for everyone,' the firm says on a web site for the gadget, which is currently only available to a handful of developers.

'Like when wearing glasses, some people may feel eye strain or get a headache.

'If you’ve had Lasik surgery, ask your doctor about risks of eye impact damage before using Glass. Don’t let children under 13 use Glass as it could harm developing vision.'

Google has also banned those under 13 from connecting Glass to their account.

It also revealed customers who struggle with health issues will be given a refund.

'If Glass is not for you and you wish to return it, do so before the end of the applicable refund period,' it said.

It also claims that internal tests have given it 'no cause for concern'.

'It’s something we’ll continue to watch carefully,' a spokesman said.

'We have been working with ophthalmologists throughout our development process.'

Dr. Eli Peli, a professor of 
opthalmology at Harvard Medical School who has been 'offering advice and
guidance' to the Glass team, said 'All told, the results we see so far are encouraging'.

'As with regular eyeglasses or a new spectacle prescription, 
some people's eyes take a bit longer to adjust to these systems.'

Dr. James Salz, a clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, told NBC News the experience of wearing Glass was similar to reading a small print book.

'Other than feeling a bit uncomfortable or getting a headache from this ... there's no evidence that this would do permanent damage to your eye,' he claimed.

However, he believes it could lead to eye dryness.

Robert Scoble, a tech blogger, has already tweeted a picture of himself in the shower with Glass - but experts warn 'private moments' could be seen by hackers

Hackers claim that with access to Glass, which is claimed to take just a few minutes with a device to obtain, they could:

Record audio and video at any time

Photograph keys to make copies

Watch online passwords being entered

See and letters being read or written

See door codes being tapped in

The health concerns come after it emerged Google's Glass wearable computer have been hacked so video and audio can be transmitted online to anyone.

Hackers
have been able to remotely watch and hear everything a wearer does, and
today warned 'nothing is safe once your Glass has been hacked.'

Although
Glass does not go on sale to the public until next year, the attack 
raises major security and privacy questions over Google's plans for the 
device.

'Once the attacker has root on your 
Glass, they have much more power 
than if they had access to your phone or even your computer: they have 
control over a camera and a microphone that are attached to your head,' 
wrote Jay 'saurik' Freeman, a well known programmer who has previously 
developed hacked to bypass security on iPhones and Android handsets.

'A bugged Glass doesn't just watch your every move: it watches 
everything you are looking at (intentionally or furtively) and hears 
everything you do.

'The obvious problem, of course, is that you might be using it in fairly private situations.

'The only thing it doesn't know are your thoughts.'

The
hack uses a known bug in the Android software that runs of the Glass, a
modified version of the Android softare also found in Google's mobile 
phones. 

'Sadly, due to the way Glass is currently designed, it is particularly 
susceptible to the kinds of security issues that tend to plague Android 
devices.

'The obvious problem, of course, is that you might be using it in fairly private situations.,' said Freeman.

He also believes the camera could easily reveal other passwords.

'However, a more subtle issue is that, in a way, it also hacks into every
device you interact with, he wrote.

The tweet that revealed the hack

'It knows all your passwords, for example, as 
it can watch you type them.

'It even manages to monitor your usage of 
otherwise safe, old-fashioned technology: it watches you enter door 
codes, it takes pictures of your keys, and it records what you write 
using a pen and paper.

'Nothing is safe once your Glass has been hacked.'

Google stressed the gadget is not yet available to the public.

'We recognize the importance of building 
device-specific protections, and we're experimenting with solutions as 
we work to make Glass more broadly available,' it said in a statement.

'It's also important to 
understand that Glass doesn’t access many parts of a Google Account, 
including settings or many products.

'And your personal MyGlass site 
allows you to change the content that you see on Glass or, if you 
misplace it, wipe all the data off your device.'

Nick Pickles, director of 
privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'The
danger with Google Glass is that the camera is seeing what you see, all
the time, while the microphone allows nearby conversations to be 
eavesdropped on.

'It 
is impossible to guarantee against these devices being hacked, so it 
would be surprising if people are allowed to wear them anywhere like 
Government buildings or in businesses that handle sensitive intellectual
property.

'While it’s
still dangerous to have a situation where someone could use glass 
without permission from the other people who are being monitored by the 
device, the implications of them being controlled by an unknown third 
party would make phone hacking look like a minor blip.

'Google
Glass offers a uniquely detailed view of your life and your 
surroundings and while Google’s main interest is selling advertising, 
there are a whole range of reasons why other people might seek to do all
they can to get access to a device.

'The only way to protect yourself and the people around you is to not wear them.'
