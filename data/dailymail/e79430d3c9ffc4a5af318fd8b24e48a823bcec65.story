A seven-months-pregnant teen accused of murdering her socialite mother and stuffing her body in a suitcase appeared at a court hearing in Bali on Wednesday.

Heather Mack, 19, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, both from Chicago, Illinois, are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack after her brutally-beaten body was discovered in the trunk of a taxi outside a luxury hotel last August.

Miss Mack, who wore a loose white shirt over her large baby bump, and her 21-year-old lover were handcuffed as they arrived at court in Denpasar on the Indonesian resort island.

The pair have been given separate trials on charges of premeditated murder, which carry a maximum sentence of the death penalty.

Mack and Schaefer said on Wednesday that they understood the charges. They are to enter pleas when the trial resumes next week.

The 19-year-old, who is due to give birth in March, once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000 before their visit to Bali, prosecutors said

Senior Police Commissioner Djoko Hariutomo told Daily Mail Online in December: ‘If they are both convicted of murder they could face the death penalty. There is evidence here of premeditation.’

The judges and prosecutors are the same in both trials. 

In their indictments, prosecutors said the couple plotted to kill Mrs von Wiese-Mack because she did not endorse their relationship. 

Mack once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000 before their visit to Bali, according to prosecutors. 

On Wednesday, the couple were brought from holding cells having been transferred to the island’s notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of the court appearance.

Their lawyers planned to submit defense pleas when the trial resumes next week.

Mack and her mother arrived in Bali on August 4 and stayed in Kuta before moving to the St. Regis hotel in Nusa Dua, where they planned to stay until August 14.

Schaefer arrived August 12 and stayed at the same hotel in a room booked by Mack under her mother's name. 

Prosecutors said that made Mack's mother angry and led to an argument in which Mrs von Wiese-Mack, who was white, scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur. 

Schaefer is black, as was Mack's father, James L. Mack, a highly regarded jazz and classical composer who died in 2006.

They said Schaefer then battered her with the iron grip of a fruit bowl. Security camera video showed the victim earlier having an argument with Schaefer in the hotel lobby.

The indictment said the couple hired a taxi and placed the suitcase containing the body in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did. 

The young couple were arrested on August 13 after checking into another hotel following the gruesome discovery of Mrs von Wiese-Mack outside the St Regis Hotel.

Police claim the pair plotted Mrs von Wiese-Mack's murder also because of another argument between Miss Mack and her mother over money.

Other evidence submitted to prosecutors included CCTV footage showing the couple speaking to a taxi driver after dropping the bloodied suitcase along with other luggage outside the hotel.

According to a statement Miss Mack has given to police, she had no part in her mother’s murder, but went along with helping her boyfriend move the body out of a sense of duty

Bali police Col. Djoko Hariutomo said that officers had questioned 12 witnesses and that their case included information from the FBI. 

Officers brought the physical evidence to the prosecutors in large sacks, including the iron grip of a fruit bowl alleged to be the weapon used in the slaying, and several computer hard drives containing hotel surveillance camera videos.

But the lawyer for the teenager claims that the killing was not premeditated and that she had hid in the bathroom while her mother was bludgeoned to death in her hotel room.  

According to a statement Miss Mack has given to police, she had no part in her mother’s murder, but went along with helping her boyfriend move the body out of a sense of duty because he was the father of her unborn baby, who is due in March. 

The account she has given to police - which her lawyer Mr Raja Nasution hopes will result in her receiving a lesser charge - paints a picture of a terrified young woman who waited in terror in the bathroom of room 317 while her boyfriend and her mother had a furious argument which resulted in Mrs Mack being beaten to death. 

A lawyer for the teenager claims that the killing was not premeditated. Miss Mack stroked her bump during Wednesday's court proceedings after telling reporters that she was having a girl

In December, Miss Mack told reporters from her cell: 'My baby is a girl, she is fine. 

'I want her to stay in Bali so she can visit me anytime while I'm in jail.'

At the time a police spokesman said that Miss Mack would continue to be under medical observation while in Kerobokan Prison because she is pregnant and due to give birth in March. 

Mack and her mother had a troubled relationship and von Wiese-Mack had frequently reported that her daughter punched and bit her, according to police reports cited by Chicago media.

Von Wiese-Mack had recently moved to a condominium in Chicago. Her husband, and Heather's father, classical music composer James Mack, died in 2006. 

The murder trials of the teenager and her boyfriend got underway in Indonesia on Wednesday with high media interest 

Handcuffs were removed from Heather Mack as she was placed back in her cell after the trial hearing. She was later taken back to the notorious Kerobokan Prison
