Burnley's hopes of Premier League survival have been dealt a serious blow after midfielder Dean Marney was ruled out for the rest of the season with a cruciate ligament injury.

Marney, 31, hurt his knee in Sunday's 2-2 draw with fellow strugglers West Brom at Turf Moor and scans have revealed the full extent of the damage.

The news is an even bigger blow for the Clarets after they failed to sign another central midfielder on transfer deadline day, failing with bids for West Brom's Graham Dorrans, Henri Lansbury of Nottingham Forest, and Dundee United's Stuart Armstrong.

The midfielder has been a key player for the Sean Dyche's side at Turf Moor this season

Marney has been a key member of Burnley's midfield alongside David Jones this season, with the former Tottenham and Hull player part of a starting line-up that has remained unchanged for the last 10 league games.

He is the second Burnley player to be ruled out for the season with an ACL injury after defender Kevin Long underwent surgery last month.Â
