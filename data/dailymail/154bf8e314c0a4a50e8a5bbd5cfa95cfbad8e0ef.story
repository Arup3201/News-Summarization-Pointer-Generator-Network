A Shetland pony who spent decades pulling carriages and sleds has retired, allowing him more time to engage in his favourite pastime - drinking pints of beer.

The 28-year-old pony, called Toby, has developed tastes slightly more luxurious than a mouthful of grass, loving nothing more than munching on mince pies and drinking a pint.

Toby's owner Amos Putt said he has already taken the animal to every pub in his home village of Fowey, Cornwall and now plans to spend more time with his equine friend after 20 years of work.

Retired: Toby, a 28-year-old Shetland pony, enjoys nothing more than a pint and may be doing even more socialising after retiring. The pony spent 20 years working at carnivals and fetes

Companions: Toby with his owner Amos Putt from St Blazey, Cornwall. MR Putt pours beer into a plastic cup, while the pony laps it up. The 71-year-old often brings the pony to the pub to enjoy a pint with him

To consume the drink, Mr Putt pours the beer into a plastic glass and holds it while the animal laps it up.

The unusual habit began when Toby worked as a carnival pony and has continued at the pair's local at St. Blazey football club.

Mr Putt, 71, a retired welder, said: 'We go out for a walk and then we go for a pint together in the pub afterwards.

'If it gets too busy he'll go outside for a drink. He doesn't get drunk. He would if he could, but I don't let him.'

Toby began working shortly after Mr Putt's wife Mags died from Multiple Sclerosis, aged 45.

The pony was used twice a week collecting donations 
for the MS Society, before going on to work at carnivals, fetes, and charity galas.

Mr Putt said Toby's last job was at a Christmas carnival where he pulled Santa on a sled.

He said: 'I could tell he wasn't 
enjoying it. There wasn't that sparkle in his eyes. So now he's out to 
pasture. He'll have a life of leisure which he really deserves.

'Hopefully, he'll live for another three to four years and we'll have a few more pints together.'

Despite his taste for ale, Mr Putt said that attempts to give the horse something stronger have backfired.

He said: 'Fowey Town Band gave him several gin and tonics one year.

'People were asking what's the matter 
with Toby and, when we got up to the top of the street and started 
marching, the band said: "You are going to have to put Toby at the 
back".

'They couldn't blow their instruments
because of the vile smell coming from Toby's bottom and that's the 
truth. It backfired on them.'

It is disputed amongst horse-owners whether beer is suitable for the animals to consume. Some myths and traditions suggest that ale has been safely mixed with horse feed for decades. But others suggest that the alcoholic content is not suitable for a horse's digestive system.
