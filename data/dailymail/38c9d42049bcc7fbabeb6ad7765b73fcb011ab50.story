Once upon a time it was Wembley’s twin towers that inspired the great England wingers, from Stanley Matthews to Tom Finney and Alan Ball.

Times may have changed and the towers long gone, but it seems today’s stars still feel drawn to the national  stadium.

The old Wembley was demolished in 2003 and four years later the new stadium rose in its place, complete with its iconic arch, whose image is inked on the arm of England’s newest wing hero Raheem Sterling.
