A company marketing guns to children as 'My First Rifle' has removed its website after a five-year-old boy shot dead his two-year-old sister while playing with one of the weapons.

The boy fired a single-shot gun called a Crickett, which is made by Keystone Sporting Arms, and which was given to the youngster last year as a gift.

He fatally shot his sister, Caroline Sparks, in the chest only minutes after her mother says she stepped outside their home in 
Burkesville, Kentucky on Tuesday.

The website, which was not accessible on Thursday, showed children of all ages firing the mini rifles, which come in a variety of colors, including blue and pink.

Worst nightmare: Authorities say Caroline's older brother, pictured with her here, fired the single shot from his .22-caliber rifle called a Cricket, fatally shooting her in the chest

Keystone Sporting Arms produced 60,000 Crickett and 
Chipmunk rifles in 2008, according to the website.  It also makes guns 
for adults, but most of its products are geared toward children.

The company's slogan is 'my first 
rifle' and its website has a 'Kids Corner' section where pictures of 
boys and girls are displayed, most of them showing the children at
 shooting ranges and on hunts.

The
 shooting highlights a cultural divide in the gun debate.

While many 
suburban and urban areas work to keep guns out of the hands of children,
 it's not uncommon for youths in rural areas to own guns for target 
practice and hunting.

Controversial: The crickett.com website carries the slogan 'My First Rifle' and sells a range of weapons

Popular: The website has a 'Kids Corner' where pictures of young boys and girls are displayed, most of them 
shown at shooting ranges and on bird and deer hunts. The website has now been removed

'Down in Kentucky where we're from, 
you know, guns are passed down from generation to generation,' Cumberland County Coroner Gary White told the Lexington Herald-Leader. 'You start 
at a young age with guns for hunting and everything.'

What is more unusual than a child having a gun, he said, is 'that a kid would get shot with it.'

'The goal of KSA is to instill gun 
safety in the minds of youth shooters and encourage them to gain the 
knowledge and respect that hunting and shooting activities require and 
deserve,' the site said.

The company said that the site was experiencing difficulties because it was inundated with traffic following the little girl's death.

Attorney John Renzulli, who spoke on behalf of the company, told Mother Jones that they were working to get the site running again, but could not specify a time.

Renzulli added that it was not the time to discuss gun control.

Loss: The family said they did not know the gun still had a round left inside, which killed little Caroline

Killed: Caroline's mourning family said they are dealing with the tragedy by turning to their faith

'This is not about Crickett 
Firearms,' he said. 'We need to respect the privacy of these people, 
this family is going through a lot. We're not going to analyze and 
evaluate what happened here until a full investigation has been 
conducted by law enforcement. At that point we'll comment.'

The coroner said the gun was kept in a corner and the family didn't realize a shell was left inside it.

It's 'just one of those crazy accidents,' White said.

The gun was given to the 5-year-old as a gift last year, 

'It was god's will. It was her time to go, I guess,' Caroline's grandmother, Linda Riddle, told Lex18. 'I just know she's in heaven right now and I know she's in good hands with the lord.'

In
 a brief news release, state police said the shooting occurred when the 
boy was 'playing' with the rifle, but did not elaborate.

It is not clear whether any charges will be filed, said Kentucky State Police spokesman Trooper Billy Gregory.

Weapon: The 5-year-old boy shot dead his sister with a Crickett .22 caliber rifle (like the one pictured) that he was given a year ago

Tailored for youngsters: Keystone Sporting Arms also makes guns for adults, but most of its products are geared toward children. The smaller guns come in all sorts of colors, including blue and pink

Scene: The dilapidated home in Cumberland County, where the young girl was shot by her brother

'I think it's too early to say whether there will or won't be,' Gregory said.

Burkesville is a small town, with a population of just under 1,800.

It is located in foothills of Appalachia.  The median household income in 2009 was estimated to be $17,747.

Bill McNeal and his son Steve McNeal decided to make guns for young shooters in the mid-1990s and opened Keystone in 1996 with just four employees, producing 4,000 rifles that year. It now employs about 70 people, according to their website.

No one at the company answered the phone on Wednesday.
