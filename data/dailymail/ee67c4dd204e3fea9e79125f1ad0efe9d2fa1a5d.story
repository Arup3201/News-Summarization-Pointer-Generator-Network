It has been claimed by none other than Frank de Boar that Blind fancies trying his luck in midfield under his former national manager Louis van Gaal.

The 24-year-old is naturally left-sided, and was used as such in defence during Holland's run to the World Cup semi-finals, but Blind proved Versatile at previous club Ajax.

Either way, Blind will look to help Van Gaal get off the mark with United yet to win a Premier League game this season.
