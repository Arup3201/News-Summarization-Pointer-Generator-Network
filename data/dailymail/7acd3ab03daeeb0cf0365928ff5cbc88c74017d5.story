Nine out of ten shops make potentially fatal mistakes when showing parents how to use child safety car seats, a report claims.

It found 90 per cent of stores visited – including branches of Halfords, Mothercare and Mamas & Papas – did not install car seats correctly.

Even the best performer, John Lewis, failed two-thirds of fittings, an undercover investigation by consumer champion Which? found.

Its report said inadequate training led to ‘serious failings and potentially dangerous mistakes that could put lives at risk’, with staff who ‘spoke confidently but gave bad advice’.

Experts visited 42 stores – six branches of each major retailer, and six independent stores. They asked staff to fit two seats, an easy Isofix model that clicks into place, and a seat that attaches to a seatbelt.

Only four shops installed both seats properly. Babies R Us and Mamas & Papas outlets failed 11 of the total of 12 fittings. Kiddicare failed nine out of 12 and staff ‘made serious errors’.

Halfords managed two successful fittings, Mothercare three and John Lewis four. Independent stores did slightly better, with seven of the 12 seats installed correctly.

Mistakes included leaving a safety support leg folded under a seat. One seat was not attached securely.

The report said staff did not take enough time and some even claimed products were broken. It adds: ‘It was clear . . . failings were often down to a lack of training. Buying a car seat isn’t enough on its own – it needs to be properly fitted, too.’

Which? editor Richard Headland said the results were ‘unacceptable’.

The report noted: ‘Of the stores we visited, 90 per cent failed to fit our car seats correctly. Only four managed to fit both our car seats properly and 13 failed to ask any essential questions before the fittings.’

‘Our experts identified three chains that performed the worst and made dangerous errors which could put a child in serious danger if the car was involved in an accident. Babies ‘R’ Us and Mamas & Papas each failed 11 of the 12 fittings with a catalogue of mistakes, while Kiddicare failed nine’. 

The report added: ‘Although Halfords passed fewer fittings than Kiddicare, Kiddicare made it into our worst three because staff made serious errors which could put a child in danger if the car was involved in an accident with the car seat as it was fitted.​’

Mamas & Papas said it had worked ‘incredibly hard’ on training and was disappointed. Babies R Us said it will strengthen training, while Kiddicare is investigating and will take action where needed.

John Lewis said it will ensure the findings are used in mandatory car seat training. Halfords said it has accredited fitting courses and has ‘substantially improved’ service.
