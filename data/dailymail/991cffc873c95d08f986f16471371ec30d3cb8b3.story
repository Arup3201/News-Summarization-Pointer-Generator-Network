Blood on his shoe: Liam Chisholm was jailed for two years for a vicious unprovoked attack on a disabled man who was left with boot prints on his face

An attacker who viciously beat a learning disabled man for no reason has been sent to prison for two years.

Liam Chisholm, 24, was one of three thugs who pounced on Andrew Thornton from behind as he played with his dog Darcy on parkland in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear.

The trio punched and kicked their victim in his face and head until he was concussed and bleeding heavily.

They left the cerebral palsy sufferer unconscious in the grass, his face marked with boot prints, with just loyal Darcy, a mongrel terrier, by his side.

After the beating, 'placid' 25-year-old Mr Thornton, who had been a keen runner, was left scared to go out alone.

In an effort to track down the attackers, his father Michael circulated a picture of his son's injuries. Outraged wellwishers quickly spread it across social media.

As a result of the social media and press appeal Chisholm, of Hebburn, who has previous convictions, was arrested and admitted assault.

Today, at Newcastle Crown Court, a judge sentenced him to two years in prison for the 'appalling' unprovoked beating in March last year.

Passing sentence, Recorder Ben Nolan QC told Chisholm: 'Your victim was a 25-year-old man who is described in a victim impact statement as mild mannered young man.

'He suffered from cerebral palsy and learning difficulties and threrefore was an extremely vulnerable young man

'You and two others, for no reason, set about upon him in a park and gave him a very bad beating.

'I have seen the pictures. He has footprints on his face.

'This was an appalling offence of its type.

'Fortunately, the press issued an appeal and members of the public came forward with information that led to your arrest.

'The message must go out that offences of this type will be met with significant prison sentences.'

Prosecutor Richard Herrmann told the court that Mr Thornton was attacked while he was out enjoying a teatime walk with his dog.

'Mr Thornton, who was walking his dog, minding his own business, throwing a stick for his dog, was approached from behind,' said Mr Herrmann.

'He recalls nothing after being punched to the back of the head and remembers then waking up on hospital.'

The injured Mr Thornton was helped by passers by who found him injured. He was taken to hospital where he had to undergo x-rays and a brain scan but had suffered no permanent or lasting damage.

When Chisholm was arrested he had Mr Thornton’s blood on his shoe.

Mr Herrmann said the effect of the violence on Mr Thornton left him afraid to go out alone and caused a marked change in his behaviour.

Katherine Dunn, defending, said in mitigation that Chisholm had a 'troubled childhood' and struggled with a serious alcohol problem.

Mr Thornton snr, a 49-year-old spray painter, released the shocking picture after his son’s assault in the hope his attackers would be brought to justice.

He said shortly after the incident: 'Andrew had been out for about an hour with his dog when he was set upon from behind.

'He can’t remember much of the attack apart from having seen a group of three lads aged about 19 to 22 hanging around on Monkton Lane shortly beforehand, and then being aware of someone approaching him quickly from the behind and to the side.

'He was knocked down and concussed. There are boot prints on his face.

'A young lad found him afterwards, called paramedics and stayed with him till they arrived, as did a woman who was passing by.

'It just goes to show there are still some good people left in the world.'
