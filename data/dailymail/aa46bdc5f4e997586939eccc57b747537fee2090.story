More than 70,000 people from the UK have applied for six dream holiday jobs in Australia.

Tourism bosses say that figure could climb another couple of thousand 
before applications close next Wednesday for the temporary posts which 
are being advertised as the 'best jobs in the world'.

Among the roles on offer are a park ranger in Queensland, a wildlife 
caretaker in South Australia and a 'lifestyle photographer' in Melbourne.

Rock on: Six dream jobs on offer in Australia include an outback adventurer to get 'up close' to wildlife

Other roles up for grabs include an Outback adventurer in the Northern Territory,

The job description involves getting 'up close and 
personal' with the wildlife, sleeping under the stars in a bush camp and soaring 
across 'postcard-worthy' landscapes in a hot air balloon.

Meanwhile others have applied to become a 'taste master' in 
Western Australia, which involves visiting the state's many 
restaurants, pubs and vineyards; and a 'chief funster' in New South 
Wales who will live in Sydney and review festivals and events.

The jobs, which start on August 1, last six months and receive a package of around £67,000, including a
salary of £35,000.

Each winner is expected to take on a promotional 
and PR role for each state.

With youth unemployment at 20.8 
per cent among those aged 16 to 24 in Britain, the prospect of earning £34,000 for 
six months' work has attracted a surge of applications.

A spokeswoman for Tourism Australia in London said: 'The response has 
been phenomenal. Maybe it's been the cold weather we've been having but 
the number of applications has been unbelievable.'

In total Tourism Australia says it has received 515,308 applications 
from across the globe, including 
76,658 applications from the UK. Some people apply for one job while 
others apply for more.

After applications close next Wednesday, the huge number will be 
shortlisted to 150 within two weeks.

The 18 finalists, who will be announced 
on May 15, will be flown out free-of-charge to Australia in 
mid-June for six days of interviews.

The six winners will be revealed on 
June 21.

The spokeswoman added: 'We've had applications from nearly every country
in the world, but Britain has the highest proportion.

'Of the total, 
76,658 applications have come from Brits looking to escape the uncertain job market here.

'This is more than from any other country - not surprising when you 
consider youth unemployment figures, the cold weather in the UK, and the
appeal of Australia's incredible experiences.'

The job competition follows Tourism Australia's successful campaign in 
2009 to find a caretaker for Hamilton Island off the Great Barrier Reef 
won by Briton Ben Southall.

He beat more than 34,000 applicants from 200
countries to spend six months snorkelling, swimming, feeding the fish 
and cleaning the pool at a three-bedroom luxury villa, as well as 
publicity duties such as blogging, compiling web diaries and videos.

Mr Southall also stayed in five-star resorts and enjoyed
jet skiing and diving on Australia's stunning Hamilton Island.

He even managed to squeeze 
in a six-part show for National Geographic, where he retraced the route
taken by James Cook more than 240 years ago.

He described it as 'the best expedition in 
the world', and spent four months kayaking, cycling and sailing 1,600km 
along the length of the Great Barrier Reef.

But Mr Southall said that he found the 'dream job' exhausting due to the combination of long hours and a strong work ethic.

'It should have been called, "the busiest job in the world",' he joked.

Tourism Australia said the initiative was part of a campaign to promote 
Australia's 12-month Working Holiday Maker visa programmes for 18 to 
30-year-olds.

Managing director Andrew McEvoy said: 'We've taken one
of the most successful tourism campaigns in recent times - 'Best Job in
the World' - and made it bigger and better by coming up with a 
competition which represents our breathtaking landscapes, our unique 
wildlife, great food and wine and, of course, our huge sense of fun.'

Rachel Parker, a University College 
London student who applied for the lifestyle photographer job said: 
'This competition is awesome. I take my camera everywhere and I’ve 
always wanted to go to Australia so I’ve applied for the lifestyle 
photographer job.

'Earning so much money, whilst doing 
something you love in an incredible city like Melbourne is not something
I want to miss out on.'

Snap happy: Those with a talent for photography can apply for a job as a photojournalist in Melbourne

The successful applicant for the position of lifestyle photojournalist for Time Out Melbourne will be required to photograph the city's cafes 
and bars as well as major festivals, music events and tourist activities
a little further afield, including surfing on the Great Ocean Road, 
skiing at Mount Hotham or meeting penguins at Phillip Island.

Meanwhile, the person hired as 'wildlife caretaker' on Kangaroo Island in South Australia will help to look after the eponymous kangaroos, swim with dolphins and sea lions, cuddle koalas and sunbathe with seals on the 
pristine beach at Seal Bay.

The role is not for the faint-hearted though, as the job description states the successful candidate will come 'face-to-face' with great white sharks.
