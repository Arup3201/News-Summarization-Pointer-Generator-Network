A mother-to-be told by doctors that her baby had died in the womb was stunned when he started breathing the moment he was born.

Six months pregnant Alex Jones, 21, was heartbroken when doctors couldn’t find a heartbeat and she would have to go through the ordeal of delivering her stillborn baby.

Ms Jones was even told by medical team to make preparations for a funeral for the baby boy she named Cohan.

Happy family: Alex Jones with Cohan, who has just celebrated his first birthday, and her daughter Maisy

But midwives were amazed seconds after the delivery that the tiny boy was breathing and wriggling his toes.

Her three-month premature baby weighed just 1lb 11oz and was very weak but was alive.

Ten doctors immediately dashed in to help as the child was whisked away to be put in an incubator.

Alex said yesterday: 'It was the most amazing thing - I was told my baby had died and to prepare myself for a stillborn delivery.

'I really thought I was going to be arranging his funeral when he was born. I was utterly heartbroken.

'Me and mum were talking about organising a little plot for him and where he would be buried.

'But when he was born my mother who was with me noticed he sort of groaned and she saw his tiny toes wriggling.

'Even the doctors and nurses were calling him a miracle baby.'

Yesterday she celebrated little Cohan's first birthday.

Ms Jones, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, told how she was 24 weeks into her pregnancy when her waters suddenly broke while watching EastEnders.

She was rushed to a maternity unit at nearby Prince Charles Hospital where doctors gave her the grim news that they couldn’t find a heartbeat.

She was transferred to Singleton Hospital in Swansea with her mother Sonia holding her hand where she gave birth naturally.

But instead of a stillborn child, she was delivered her miracle baby boy Cohan - even though he was very premature and weak.

She has spent every waking minute at his side in hospital as he grew stronger day-by-day.

His heartbeat had to be regulated in intensive care for five months while he battled a number of infections and was fed through a drip.

He was also treated for a deadly clot on his brain after being transferred to Singleton Hospital in Swansea.

Nurses there threw a party for Cohan when he survived for 100 days.

And Cohan, who now weighs 14lb 9oz, has just celebrated his first birthday with a party at the family home.

Ms Jones, who has a three-year-old daughter Maisy, said: 'I have to pinch myself that he’s here at all. I was devastated when six months into my pregnancy they couldn’t find any trace of a heartbeat.

'When they delivered him, everyone was shocked that he was breathing. No-one was prepared for it.

'But even then, they gave him little chance to survive. I thought he was a child I would never be able to hold in my arms.

'But look at him now. He is a very happy baby and a little boy who really fought for his life. It’s such a relief to see him smiling. Even the doctors can’t believe how well he is now.

'We are not blaming anyone - his heartbeat must have been so weak the doctors were unable to detect it.

'All that matters is that Cohan’s alive. I will always think of him as my miracle baby.'

Proud grandmother Sonia, 49, told how she first heard the baby’s gasp and realised he was alive.

She said: 'I saw his little legs first because he was breach when he came out.

'I heard a little groan and then I saw his toes wiggle. I thought I was imagining it at first.

'I told the midwife and then she realised he was breathing. Suddenly ten doctors were in the room working on him.

'They resuscitated him and then whisked him away. We were told not to get our hopes up because he was very poorly.

'But that little groan proved to be a miracle because my grandson has survived.

'Up until that point it had been the worst moment of our lives - Alex had been breaking her heart because she was expecting her baby to be stillborn. We thought there was no hope.

'We never expected it after being told by the doctors they couldn’t find the heartbeat and there was nothing they could do.

'But it seems he had been tightly tucked up in her womb and was so small they hadn’t been able to gage his heartbeat.

'It was two weeks before Alex could hold him for the first time. He weighed less than a bag of sugar but he was such a little fighter and he held on to his little life.'

Cohan is still under weight but is gaining strength every day and he is expected to live a normal life.

A spokeswoman for the Cwm Taf Health Board said: 'We are delighted Cohan is doing so well.'
