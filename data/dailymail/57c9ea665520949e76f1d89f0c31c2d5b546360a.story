A teen mom and pastor's daughter has confessed to her family that she does not know who fathered her 11-month-old baby in a new reality show.

Olivia Perry, 18, from  Oceano, California, is one of the stars of Preachers' Daughters, which focuses on three young people who struggle to follow their religious parents' strict rules.

She gave birth to a little girl called Eden last year after she spent the previous summer experimenting with drugs, 'partying a lot and sleeping around', and as a result she must now get a paternity test.

Confession time: Teen mom and pastor's daughter Olivia Perry has confessed to her family that she does not know who fathered her 11-month-old baby Eden in a new reality show

In a preview for the show, which airs on the Lifetime network on March 12, the single mother and Cuesta College student tells her siblings: 'So you know how Eden's father is Sean... Well there’s actually a chance that she could be this guy’s name Jay’s.'

Her family's shocked reactions are captured on camera. Olivia's model sister Emily, 20, tells viewers: 'It’s definitely hard to hear that my little sister’s slept with more than one guy. She’s my little sister, I don’t want to hear that she’s slept with any guy.' 

And eldest sister Audrey, 23, an 
aspiring missionary, adds: 'My initial reaction was what kind of girl
 was she? Was she known as like the slutty girl?'

Olivia then broaches the subject with her father Mark, the senior leader at the Everyday Church in Oceano, and her mother Cheryl.

Unsurprisingly, they are dismayed to learn about their daughter's promiscuous behavior.

'Your teenage daughter gets 
pregnant... That fits perfectly with the stereotype, "The pastor 
can’t even control his own family"'

'I mean how many guys are we talking about?' Mr Perry asks, before telling Olivia: 'There needs to be a paternity test. Let's pray for you.'

Olivia said that she contemplated having an abortion after discovering that she was pregnant aged 17.

'Being a preacher's daughter is hard. It feels like you can’t really mess up,' she says.

But her father told her that she would be 'killing' his granddaughter, and so she kept the baby.

Mr Perry details in the trailer how he struggled to come to terms with the pregnancy.

In the spotlight: Baby Eden - Olivia's 11-month-old daughter - is the youngest star of Lifetime's new docu-series Preachers' Daughters

'As a pastor your teenage daughter gets pregnant. That fits perfectly with the stereotype; "Oh yeah the pastor can’t even control his own family,"' he says.

The father-of-three says he took part in the reality show to
 help dispel misconceptions about the lives of religious leaders and their 
families, including the idea that pastors behave one way in public and 
another way behind closed doors.

'We didn’t say yes to the show because we wanted to be on TV. We said yes because we wanted to tell our story.

'We’ll be able to show our weaknesses and hopefully our strengths... It’s not really a religious show. It’s a human show. It’s a family show,' he told The Tribune.

Strong beliefs: Olivia's father, Mark, is the senior leader at the Everyday Church in Oceano

Religious upbringing: Olivia admits that 'being a preacher's daughter is hard'

His wife, Cheryl, who oversees Everyday Church events and community outreach as its 'connect pastor', added: 'Our church knows who we are. They know 
the difficulties we face.'

Cheryl and Mark met in 1985 at a church in San Luis Obispo, California.

They went on to establish a church in the mid west, before returning to the Central Coast in 2002 to found a regional church and apostolic center.

They launched the Everyday Church, a non-denominational, Christian place of worship, on Easter Sunday in 2004.

Their three children were raised to respect Christian values.

Their youngest daughter, Olivia, who has now put her partying days to bed, says that her faith has helped her and she hopes that her TV appearance will help other teen moms.

'People will be able to see that there is hope in hopeless situations,' she said.

The Perry family were followed for five weeks last October and November when Olivia's baby daughter was just six months old.

In addition to Perrys the series follows  Taylor Coleman, 18, from Lockport, Illinois, whose father, Ken, is a Pentecostal Church pastor.

Taylor reveals in one of the previews that she would like to become a porn star.

The series was produced by Thinkfactory Media, the company behind A&E reality show Gene Simmons Family Jewels and the History mini series Hatfields & McCoys.

Preachers’ Daughters airs Tuesday, March 12 at 10pm on Lifetime.
