A high school math teacher in Tennessee was caught in an affair with a student after her husband turned over to police a camera with sexually explicit pictures of his wife and the 16-year-old.

Sherri Lynn Baffa, 37, was sentenced to serve eight years in prison on Monday after taking a plea deal in which she accepted the charges but, did not admit she was guilty.

But, in a bizarre twist, her now-ex-husband who turned her in, has also been arrested -- charged with seven counts of aiding and promoting the illicit relationship.

Doing time: Sherri Lynn Baffa, 37, will serve every day of her eight year sentence, according to her plea deal

The photos, which prosecutors say showed Baffa and the student naked and having sex, were taken February 2007, when the student was 16, the Kingsport Times.

The gender of the student was not revealed. It is also unknown whether the teen was in Baffa's classes.

Ex-husband: Michael Hunter Campbell, who turned his wife in to police, was later arrested, as well

Baffa's then-husband, Michael Hunter Campbell, 38, turned the images over to police in May 2011.

Baffa taught algebra and geometry at Sullivan East High School in Bluff City, Tennessee, before she resigned earlier this year.

She turned herself in after a grand jury indicted her in August.

Baffa was charged with seven counts of especially aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor.

The former student is now 20 years old. It is unclear how long the relationship lasted.Â 

As part of the deal, Baffa will have 
to register as a sex offender for at least ten years after she gets out 
of jail. She must also serve every day of her eight year prison 
sentence.

Prosecutors won't say what led to the charges against Campbell, who divorced Baffa. He was indicted by a grand jury in May.

The
indictment alleges he 'promoted, employed, used, assisted, transported,
or permitted a minor to participate in the performance of, or in the 
production of, acts or material which includes the minor engaging in 
sexual activity.'
