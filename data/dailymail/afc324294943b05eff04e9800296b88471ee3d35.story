These images show the shocking injuries suffered by a 24-year-old mother who was battered in her home by her ex-boyfriend because she didn't say 'bye' to him in the pub.

Victoria O'Callaghan, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, was left unrecognisable by 28-year-old Anthony Kearney after he broke into her home and savagely assaulted her for up to an hour.

The assistant cook, who split with Kearney in October, was told by police that if the attack had continued for another 10 minutes she would have been killed.

Miss O'Callaghan's former boyfriend climbed in through an upstairs window and found her sleeping next to the fire in her living room at around 5am on Boxing Day.

The mother-of-one said: 'He was going mad, shouting how I didn't say bye to him. He strangled me, kicked me, and even stood on my head so I couldn't move.

'His foot was on my neck, choking me. I must have passed out then as I can't remember any more.'

He even stamped on her wrist where metal pins had been  removed from the joint after a recent break.

After the assault he urged her to lie to her family and pretend she had been brutally mugged while walking home.

Kearney was jailed for two years at Liverpool Crown Court last month after admitting actual bodily harm and was given a restraining order to keep him away from Miss O'Callaghan.

Miss O'Callaghan, who has four-year-old son, has decided to speak out about her horrific ordeal to encourage others trapped in a cycle of domestic violence to seek help.

She revealed she suffered regular violence at the hand's of her boyfriend but was too afraid to get help until their eventual split last year. 

'It was the beatings that made us break up,' she said. 'He'd give me black eyes. He would drink and lose his temper.

'That's the danger of domestic violence. You don't realise when you're involved in it. I thought everyone was against him at the time.

'I thought, wrongly, I could control the situation.I was making excuses for him. But he has hatred inside him.'

Her friend Charlotte, the first person to see her in such a terrible state, said: 'I was in tears when I saw her. It was horrendous.'

But Miss O'Callaghan said she felt proud of going to police, and was encouraging other people to report their violent partners and not suffer in silence.

She added: 'I know a lot of people would keep quiet. You don't realise the support you've got. You think you're alone with it all.

'I'm lucky to be alive after what he did to me. I shudder to think of the women who stay with men who do this to them year in and year out.'
