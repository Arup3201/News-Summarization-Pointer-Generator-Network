The composer behind popular TV theme tunes including Have I Got News For You and The Office died of a heart attack after taking the illegal party drug known as Meow Meow, an inquest has heard.

George Webley, 53, who was also an award-winning radio presenter, was found struggling for breath at his home by his wife.

The father-of-four, known by fans as ‘Big George’, suffered a massive heart attack and was pronounced dead when paramedics arrived.

The class-C drug was outlawed in April last year after it was linked with a series of deaths.

Milton Keynes Coroner Thomas Osborne 
recorded a verdict of death by misadventure yesterday, saying: ‘The 
verdict should be that Mr Webley suffered quite severe heart disease.

‘Because of the cathinones found in 
his blood - these designer drugs - and his previous illness, it’s more 
likely than not that the final event was caused by the drugs in his 
system.

‘It is wrong to record natural 
causes. The verdict is he died as a result of misadventure. He was 
taking the drugs not for taking his own life but this was an action that
went wrong and led to his heart attack and subsequent death.’

Mr Webley was found collapsed by his wife, Sheila, on May 7.

She opened the back door to give him some fresh air before calling for an ambulance but he was dead by the time help arrived.

The grandfather-of-three was a 
proficient guitarist and pianist as a teenager who played in bands 
before moving into the London recording session scene. During this 
period he worked on dozens of advertising jingles.

In 1989 he became musical director for Jameson Tonight, a daily chat show on Sky hosted by Derek Jameson.

But in the 1990s he became a leading 
composer and arranger of television theme tunes. Other well-known 
jingles included those for The Office and Room 101.

He once wrote that ‘if passports 
still stated occupation, mine would say “composer of music with an 
average duration of 29 seconds”’.

Mr Webley also began a radio career 
in the mid-1990s and in 2002 won a gold Sony Award for best music 
presenter for his show on BBC Three Counties Radio, which covers 
Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire.

In 2006 he moved to BBC London 94.9, hosting a popular late night show.
He also appeared on television as a music expert for Graham Norton’s Eurovision programmes and BBC education series Music File.

Mrs Webley was unavailable to comment yesterday.

A statement on the family website after his death said: ‘Our hearts go out to all those who share our loss.’

BBC London 94.9 editor David Robery 
paid tribute at the time, saying: ‘Big George lived up to his name in 
every sense. He will be terribly missed.

‘He was a larger than life character with a radio personality to match.’

Mephedrone was barely known three 
years ago but is now as popular as cocaine among 16 to 24-year-olds, the
British Crime Survey revealed last month.

More than one in 25 – almost 300,000 
young people – admitted taking it last year. It is sold online as plant 
food or bath salts and costs less than £25 for a gram.
