Kris Boyd insists he is returning to Rangers a better and less selfish footballer than before.

The Scotland striker ended weeks of speculation by penning a one-year deal with the Ibrox club on Friday.

Scorer of 128 goals in 192 appearances between 2006 and 2010, Boyd nonetheless concedes he was a ‘selfish’ player in his first period at Rangers. But the 30-year-old believes spells in Turkey and the United States have been the making of him.

Champions, again? Rangers are looking to secure their back-to-back-to-back promotions and an SPL return

Boyd said: ‘I’m not going to change. I’m not going to start dropping back 50 yards and taking four or five people on. But I have become more aware of the game.

‘There were times before when I maybe scored one or two goals in the first 10 minutes and you’d feel your job was done.

‘You stop doing things for the team and I was just being pretty selfish probably.

‘Now I feel you need to be a team player because the game has changed so much. You need to help your team-mates on the pitch. That’s a challenge I look forward to now.’

Aberdeen and Dundee United were keen to sign Boyd while Kilmarnock also wanted to retain the man whose 22 goals saved them from last season’s relegation play-offs.

But a call from Ally McCoist 10 days ago convinced him to pledge his future to Rangers.

‘This is a great club with a great fanbase,’ added Boyd. ‘I can’t wait to play in front of that crowd at Ibrox again.’ McCoist agrees Boyd is a more mature player now.

‘Kris is probably still the most natural finisher in the country,’ he said. ‘His goal tally last year at Kilmarnock was sensational and it’s maybe not for me to say but his goals certainly went a way to keeping them in the division.

‘We are bringing back a far more experienced player.

‘He is at a stage where he will be a real benefit to our team with his experience, his goals and the knowledge he has gained from all the places he’s been throughout his career.'

Target: Ally McCoist is pleased to have secured Boyd signature to play alongside fellow sigining Kenny Miller
