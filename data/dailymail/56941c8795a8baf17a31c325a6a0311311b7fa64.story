The Australian radio DJ who made the prank call to the London hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated during her pregnancy has resigned.

Mel Greig accused radio station Southern Cross Austereo of failing to maintain a safe workplace, as the international furore that followed the royal hoax saw her vilified in media across the globe.

The prank by Mel Greig and her colleague Michael Christian in December last year was linked to the death of British nurse Jacintha Saldanha.

Royal baby: The prank call was made to the King Edward VII hospital where The Duchess of Cambridge was treated for acute morning sickness shortly before her pregnancy was announced

Ms Greig and Mr Christian made a prank call to London's King Edward VII Hospital in December last year, where the Duchess was being treated for severe morning sickness.

The presenters - pretending to be the Queen and Prince Philip - were put through to her ward by Bristol mother-of-two nurse Ms Saldanha, who took her own life three days after the hoax was widely publicised in the media.

In a statement released in Australia, the Southern Cross Austereo said the dispute arising from the royal hoax had been ‘amicably resolved’ and Ms Greig had resigned, effective from December 31 this year.

The company reiterated its position 
that recording and broadcasting the fateful call was ‘not unlawful’ and 
said 2Day FM decided to broadcast the call despite suggestions from Ms 
Greig that it should be changed.

In
a statement, Austero said: ‘Prior to the call being broadcast she made 
suggestions for changes to be made to the recording of the call.

‘2Day FM decided that the call should be broadcast without alteration.’

Austero said Ms Greig intended to provide a statement to the UK coroner's inquest and that the station would co-operate fully.

The inquest into Ms Saldanha's death has been opened and adjourned.

The stunt drew widespread criticism with the the hospital's boss John Lofthouse saying: 'This was a foolish prank call that we
all deplore.'

Controversy: The 2 Day FM radio presenters Christian and Greig were behind the prank-call which reportedly broke the law

Receptionist: ‘Hello, good morning, King Edward VII Hospital’

Female presenter (Mel Greig, impersonating the Queen): ‘Oh, hello there. Could I please speak to Kate please, my granddaughter?’

Receptionist:  ‘Oh yes, just hold on ma’am’

Male presenter (Michael Christian, impersonating Prince Charles): ‘Are they putting us through?’

Greig: ‘Yes’

Christian: ‘If this has worked it is the easiest prank call we have ever made. Your accent sucked by the way, I just want you to know’

[Both laughing]

Greig: ‘I’m not used to playing old an 80-year-old’

[Phone picked up]

Greig: ‘Kate, my darling.  Are you there?’

Nurse: ‘Good morning ma’am, this is the nurse speaking, how may I help you?’

Greig: ‘I’m just after my granddaughter Kate. I want to see how her little tummy bug is going?’

Nurse: ‘She’s sleeping at the moment and she has had an uneventful night. And sleep is good for her. She's been given some fluids [part removed due to patient confidentiality].  She's stable at the moment.'

[Part removed due to patient confidentiality]

Greig:
’I’ll just feed my little corgis then. When is a good time to come and 
visit her, because I’m the Queen and I need a lift down there?’

[In background: Mummy, mummy]

‘Charles! When can you take me to the hospital, Charles?’

Christian: ‘When will it be alright to come down and see her?  Maybe in the morning or something if that’s OK?’

Nurse:
‘I would suggest that any time after nine o’clock would be suitable 
because the doctor will be in in the morning and will just be getting 
her freshened up. I would think any time after nine.’

Christian: ‘Is Wills still there or has he gone home? I haven’t spoken to him yet.’

Nurse:  ‘He went home probably at about nine o’clock last night, to be fair.’

Christian: ‘Lovely, but are they all ok? Everything is alright?’

Nurse: [Removed due to confidentiality]

Christian: ‘Of course, it’s hardly the palace is it?’

Greig: ‘ It’s nothing like the palace, is it Charles? When are you going to walk those bloody corgis?’ 

Christian: ‘Mumsy, I’ll go and take the dogs outside’

Greig:  ‘I need to go visit Kate in the morning. My dear, thank you so much’ 

Nurse: ‘You are very welcome’

Greig: ‘Goodbye’

Nurse: ‘Goodbye’

[Both presenters burst into laughter]

Greig: ’She was giving real information’

Christian: ‘Mummy I think they just believed everything we just said’
