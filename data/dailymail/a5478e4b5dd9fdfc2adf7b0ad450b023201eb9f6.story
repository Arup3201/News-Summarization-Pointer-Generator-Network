A teacher died when she was thrown from her horse, which relatives described as ‘the love of her life’.

Jayne Goodwin, 44, had dismounted Kali, her six-year-old Friesian, to close a gate. As she tried to get back on, the ‘flighty’ animal bolted without warning and she fell.

The experienced rider suffered ‘unsurvivable’ brain injuries and some days later her devastated family decided to turn off her life-support machine, an inquest at Leeds coroner’s court heard.

Her brother, Chris, said in a statement: ‘The love of her life was Kali. As a child Jayne had always dreamed of a day when she would have a life full of riding and a stable full of horses, and she was living that life.’

Miss Goodwin, who lived near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, kept seven horses along with three dogs and seven cats. She took Kali to several shows and had taken up dressage competition.

But coroner David Hinchliff said the mare had developed a habit of suddenly setting off before her rider was properly mounted.

Miss Goodwin’s friend Georgina Adkin said in a statement: ‘Kali was always flighty, but Jayne was a very experienced rider and felt she had her behaviour under control.’

After going riding with friends on the evening of January 9 last year, Miss Goodwin dismounted Kali to close a gate as the group returned to the stable yard. 

She then tried to get back on the horse. Mr Hinchliff said: ‘She put her leg into the stirrup, but as she went to lift her right leg over, Kali raised her head and set off at a fast canter.’

Miss Goodwin was heard to cry out, ‘Oh Christ, she’s going’, as the horse bolted. She was carried out of sight of her friends before falling to the ground.

Miss Adkin shouted her name, then found her on the ground ‘at a funny angle’ with her helmet still on. 

She told the inquest: ‘I wasn’t sure whether Kali had hit her in the head as Jayne got on or whether it was the speed at which she set off that caused her to fall.’

Miss Adkin saw blood and, realising her friend was unconscious, called an ambulance.

Miss Goodwin was taken to Leeds General Infirmary, and a CT scan revealed a ‘very severe and unsurvivable brain injury’.

She was taken off a ventilator 19 days later, on January 28, after doctors told the family she had no chance of recovery. 

Police attended the accident scene and found there were no suspicious circumstances.

Miss Goodwin, who was born in Stockton-on-Tees, moved to Leeds for university when she was 19, the inquest heard. She loved children and spent 14 years as a teacher in Leeds. Several school parents wrote letters to her family after her death.

In his statement, Miss Goodwin’s brother said: ‘She made a real difference to those she taught. We will miss her so much. She has left a huge hole in our hearts and lives.’

Mr Hinchliff recorded a verdict of accidental death.

The highly experienced rider, who always wore protective equipment, suffered a fatal brain injury
