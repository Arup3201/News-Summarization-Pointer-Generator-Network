A couple's 26-year bid to learn the truth about their son’s disappearance could soon be over.

Police reviewing the case of school boy Lee Boxell have arrested three men and a woman on suspicion of his murder.

Lee was just 15 when he disappeared in 1988, and his parents Peter and Christine have been seeking an explanation ever since.

Lee Boxell (above) was just 15 when he was last seen on Sutton High Street in Croydon in September 1988. Police believe his disappearance could be linked to an unofficial youth club run at the time in the grounds of St Dunstan's Church (above left)

Battle: Peter Boxell, 67 and Christine Boxell, 72 from Sutton holding a picture of their son

At the time of his disappearance, there was a £20,000 reward for anyone knowing any information that may lead to his whereabouts. Arrests has finally been made, the first arrests since the investigation started.

The teenager was last seen in Sutton high street 26 years ago, but his parents have never given up the search, and they now believe the recent developments could finally give them the truth about their son

Mrs Boxell, right, said that since their son disappeared, their lives have been 'horrendous' and they are preying the new developments will bring results

Last night the pair told the Daily Mail the development could finally solve the mystery of what happened to their son.

Police
 enquiries have focused on a church building in the area near where he 
was last seen, which has since discovered to have been a haunt of 
paedophiles – with detectives saying the teenager could have been killed
 to keep him quiet.

One of the three men arrested is 78, meaning he was 52 when Lee vanished.

The
 other two men are 41 and 42, and the arrested woman is 42 making three 
of those being questioned a similar age to Lee at the time.

Lee’s
 mother Mrs Boxell, 72, who still lives at the family home in Cheam, 
south-west London, said: ‘I’ve wanted this for so long – we’ve got to 
know what happened to him 25 years ago.

Specialist search teams spent 12 months searching the church yard for any sign of Lee Boxell

Lee's mother Christine Boxell said police spent £1 million searching the graveyard for evidence 'and literally left no stone unturned'

'In the back of my mind I have to hope that he will still come back - that’s how I keep going.

'I remember that day on September 10, 1988, like it was yesterday.

'Our life ever since has been horrendous.'

She added: ‘I just hope these four people arrested will say something.’

And
 Lee’s father Mr Boxell, 67, said of the arrests: ‘I think it’s a 
fantastic development and I just really hope and pray it will result in 
us finding Lee.

Police believe an outbuilding at the church yard known locally as 'The Shed' may have been used by a paedophile ring to target children

‘We’ve known for some months the arrests were going to happen, it had all been planned.’

Lee’s
 parents have not changed his bedroom since the day he disappeared, 
refusing to give up hope, and have never stopped searching for him.

The
 teenager was last seen in Sutton high street and police assumed he had 
gone to watch a football match at nearby Selhurst Park – but that was 
ruled out.

The Metropolitan Police has confirmed it has arrested three men aged between 41 and 78 in connection with Lee Boxell's murder. A 42-year-old woman has also been arrested for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and indecency with children

It was then 
realised he used to spend time in a building at St Dunstan’s church, 
nicknamed ‘the Shed’, which is now known to have been a gathering place 
for teenagers, who became a target for sexual predators.

Last year Detective Inspector John McQuade said: ‘Some of them were as young as 12 or 13.

'There are people out there like Jimmy Savile who will take advantage of people like that.’

Among
 a number of paedophiles now known to have been operating in the area at
 the time, one, William Lambert, was three years ago convicted of 
abusing four girls in the 1980s and jailed for 11 years at the age of 
75. 

Police spent twelve months searching the graveyard near 'the Shed' where Lee Boxell was understood to have spent time with fellow teenagers before he vanished in September 1988

Detectives used 
radar to  look for any disturbance in the graves surrounding the Shed 
and carried out further searches  last spring.

Last
 year, to coincide with what would have been Lee’s 40th birthday, a new 
Crimewatch appeal was made by Mr and Mrs Boxell, who also have a 
grown-up daughter called Lindsey, and are grandparents to a 
three-year-old girl and six-year-old-boy.

They worked with the Metropolitan police to launch a fresh campaign with a £20,000 reward.

At the time of the appeal Mr Boxell said: ‘We, Lee’s family, need answers to what happened to [him].

'Someone in this community can give us those answers. Please help us bring Lee home.’
