Shot dead: Millie Canjura, 31, was shot dead as she sat in her car outside her home. Her unborn child did not survive

A pregnant woman was shot dead as she sat in her car outside her family home in a 'cold blooded' murder on Saturday. 

Millie Canjura was shot multiple times at 8.40pm outside her home in Bay Shore, Long Island. Her unborn child also died in the attack. 

Canjura held a baby shower at her house a week ago and there was a drive-by shooting at the property a week before that but no one was hurt, according toCBS News.  

The woman was six months pregnant, according to friends. 

Neighbor Neil Washington told CBS News:'In cold blood.That’s the part that disturbs me. They shot this young lady in cold blood. 

'And the most disturbing part of this whole thing that was going on last night is to come out to the corner of the yard, and you could actually see her body slumped over. Breaks my heart.'

Suffolk County police say they responded to a call of gunshots at about 8:40 p.m. Saturday and found 31-year-old Milagro G. Canjura unresponsive outside her home.

She was taken by ambulance to Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, where she and the fetus were pronounced dead. 

No one has been arrested for the murder and police have not released any details on suspects. 

Neighbors told Newsday that Canjura had moved into a basement apartment at the property a year ago with her husband. 

Friends told the paper that she was going to name her child Kamila and described the mother-to-be as 'so sweet'.
