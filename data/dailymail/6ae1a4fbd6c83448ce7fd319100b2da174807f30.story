Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were given a fond welcome yesterday as they arrived in Papua New Guinea to begin a two-week tour to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

The Prince and his wife were draped with garlands of flowers and cheered by crowds when they stepped off their plane in the capital, Port Moresby.

They were greeted by schoolchildren in tribal dress who performed a hiri dance, traditionally used to welcome traders to a village.

Teenage dancer Jessie David, wearing 
only a leaf skirt, body paint and a headdress made of bird of paradise 
feathers, was given the honour of placing orchid garlands on the 
shoulders of the Royals.

Prince Charles is known as the Queen’s
‘pikinini’ in the pidgin English spoken in the Pacific nation. The 
Queen is known as ‘Missis Kwin’ and ‘Mama belong big family’. This is 
Prince Charles’s fourth trip to Papua New Guinea. He first visited in 
1966.

The Royal couple will today attend a 
church service in a sports stadium in the capital Port Moresby with a congregation of hundreds.

They
will spend three days in Papua New Guinea before travelling to 
Australia, and will wrap up their trip in New Zealand, where Charles 
will celebrate his 64th birthday on November 14.

That visit will include a traditional 
Maori welcome, which involves the hongi, or pressing of noses, and the 
couple will inspect costumes from the new Peter Jackson film, The 
Hobbit.

At one end of the red carpet Charles and Camilla met Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, his wife Lynda Babao and other senior dignitaries.

At the other end, local schoolchildren in tribal dress performed a hiri dance - used to welcome traders to a village.

Citizens of Papua New Guinea speak more than 800 languages between them, with everyday communication conducted through English and Tok Pisin - a form of Melanesan Pidgin English.

After the greetings on the red carpet the Prince stood to attention for the British and Papua New Guinea national anthems, played by a military band, as 2,000 well wishers on a nearby hill watched proceedings at Jacksons International Airport.

Two rows of soldiers from the Papua New Guinea defence force lined up in front of the royals to form a guard of honour.

Their commander Brigadier General Francis Agwi escorted the Prince as he passed down the ranks inspecting the servicemen, stopping briefly to chat to some of them.

The Brigadier General was placed under house arrest by soldiers under his command earlier this year during an abortive coup that attempted to return former prime minister Sir Michael Somare back to power.

Later Charles was invested with the insignia of a Grand Companion of the Order of Logohu - an honour which carries the title of chief - by Governor General Sir Michael Ogio at the Airways Hotel.

The Order of Logohu - the Motuan tribe's word for the bird of paradise - is part of a new honours system introduced in 2005, the nation's 30th anniversary year, which recognises the high achievement of individuals.

Camilla was presented with the insignia of a Companion of the Order of the Star of Melanesia and the royal couple also received the Queen's Diamond Jubilee commemorative medal.

Charles joked to the Governor General that it was 'very nice arriving when it wasn't too hot, there was a nice breeze'.

The Governor General's wife Esmie is a former hotel housekeeping maid from the Solomon Islands who married the Queen's representative last year in what was billed as the first state wedding in Papua New Guinea's history.

The couples posed together for a picture before retiring for the night.

The Prince and Duchess's itinerary 
begins today with them attending a traditional Sunday church service 
in a sports stadium with a congregation of hundreds.

Charles
is colonel-in-chief of the Royal Pacific Islands Regiment and will 
present the unit with new colours before the royals watch a cultural 
performance in the arena.

Later in the day the Prince and Duchess will travel to the village of Boera where they will be shown elements of rural life including the products of traditional arts and crafts before meeting elders from local communities.

They will also watch a war dance and learn about conservation work to preserve coastal mangrove forests and plant saplings.

In the evening a state dinner will be staged in their honour hosted by the Governor General and his wife.
