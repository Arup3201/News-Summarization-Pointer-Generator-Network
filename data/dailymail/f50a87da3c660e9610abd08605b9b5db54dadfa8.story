Mesut Ozil has defended his decision to swap shirts with Geoffrey Kondogbia on the pitch during Arsenal’s Champions League clash with Monaco on Tuesday evening.

The Germany international faced criticism for trading jerseys with the French midfielder at half-time as Arsene Wenger’s side were eliminated from the Champions League despite a 2-0 win at Stade Louis II.

‘Geoffrey Kondogbia asked me for my shirt and I wanted to do him a favour,’ Ozil told Sky Sports Germany.

‘Maybe I should have given him the shirt in the tunnel. But seriously guys, is there nothing more important to discuss for a knockout game than a shirt swap?’

Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes, who was working as a pundit for ITV, was unhappy with Ozil’s move as he made his way to Arsenal’s dressing room.

‘I don’t like it — at the end of the game, maybe. But I’m not a big fan even then,’ said Scholes.

‘You do it once you’re in the tunnel or once you’re in the dressing room, out of the way of everyone. At half-time, it’s not for me.’

The incident was not the first time an Arsenal player has come under fire for swapping shirts as Andre Santos faced criticism for trading jerseys with Robin van Persie at half-time during the club’s 2-1 defeat to Manchester United in 2012.
