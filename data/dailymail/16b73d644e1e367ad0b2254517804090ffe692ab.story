Ever wondered about some of the three letter airport codes across the world? While some are clearly obvious, others just leave us scratching our heads.

But airport codes are more than just three randomly assigned letters stuck to your luggage. These little abbreviations are telling us exactly where we are flying around the world.

While some make perfect sense for example Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, they're all pretty simple - SYD, MEL, PER, the first three letters of each city's name.

The Domestic Terminal Perth Airport Australia (pictured). The ones that make perfect sense, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, they're all pretty simple - SYD, MEL, PER, the first three letters of each city's name.

And you'd think it would be just as simple for every other airport to follow, but not so.

Brisbane had to ditch the BRI in favour of BNE because it was already taken by an airport in the Italian city of Bari, according to the Australian Business Traveller.

Unfortunately the easy selection of BAR had to be avoided because it was assigned to the Baker Army Airfield which is now abandoned.

And in some cases the tricky airport code skips a letter or two just like Adelaide's ADL and Auckland's AKL or in Hong Kong's case (HKG) picking a few from both words.

But here comes the more cryptic codes, that leave us asking the question, why?

Almost every traveller usually understands the LAX code which stands for the famous Los Angeles airport - but have you ever wondered where that X comes from?

According to Australian Business Traveller it's a remnant from the early days of air travel when airports were referred to by a two letter 'weather station' code.

When the growth of air travel created the need for three-letter codes, the airport’s original designation had an ‘X’ amended to ease the transition, as did Portland (PDX).

Dublin, Ireland took the code DUB so that meant that Dubai had to import the 'X' to make it DXB, only really to fill out the three characters.

In other cases across the world, the airport codes take the first letter of the city's name followed by two letters for the airport itself.

London, Heathrow is LHR while one of the countries other main airports London Gatwick is LGW.

Or to really throw a spanner in the works, and getting rid of the L altogether, the London Stansted airport is tagged as STN, slightly confusing.

Beijing airport in China (pictured) Beijing is PEK. It represents the old anglicised name of Peking which was changed to Beijing after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949

In Asia, old school sometimes takes preference. Beijing is in fact PEK. It represents the old anglicised name of Peking which was changed to Beijing after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

In the United States, Chicago is also stepping back in time with its code ORD. While officially known as the O'Hare International Airport, the original O'Hare field strip was adjacent to a small farming community called Orchard Place, which was taken by the airport.

And you'd be excused for thinking WTF when you arrive in Canada with all of the nation's airport codes beginning with the letter Y. 

In the early days of broadcast radio the North American market was divided into three geographic zones, each carrying a regional-specific letter to be used in front of a station's callsign.

Australian Business Traveller says the US stations were assigned W if they were located east of the Mississippi River and K if they were west of the mighty Mississippi. All radio stations in Canada got Y.

So you've got Vancouver (YVR) and Ottawa (YOW).

Toronto airport in Canada (pictured) Oh Canada! Toronto's appellation of YYZ is more of a puzzler, and came about because YTO was already assigned as Toronto’s generic region code

And even when we go closer to home, the airport codes get a little crazy for thought.

The proposed Sydney West Airport at Badgery's Creek has already been christened as SWZ.

And there's even the slightly funny ones, that might send out a chuckle. Has anyone flown to SUX? The airport code for Sioux City, Iowa.

Apparently the airport has made fun of its unfortunate name selling a variety of SUX souvenirs.

But the more unfortunate ones are these. Russia's Bolshoye Savino Airport is stuck with PEE, while the number 2 version goes to Brazil's Poco De Caldas Airport with POO.

There's even one for FAT, the airport code for Fresno, Calif.
