Eight-legged feast: Stefan Gates munches on a tarantula

Tarantula kebabs, fried crickets and mealworm burgers... it sounds like a stomach-churning I’m A Celebrity bushtucker trial, or perhaps one of celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal’s more outlandish recipes.

In fact, bugs and grubs could become a staple of our daily diet in the not-too-distant future, according to nutrition experts.

Food writer Stefan Gates has spent the past few  months in far-flung destinations where insects are eaten every day and as delicacies.

His journey will feature in a BBC documentary, Can Eating Insects Save The World? – to be broadcast next month – and he says that such outlandish fare will become the norm in Britain before long.

The Dutch – perhaps in response to a United Nations warning that meat will rocket in price due to booming populations – have already invested six-figure sums into researching ways of getting caterpillars and locusts into mainstream foods.

Here are some reasons why, and how, it  could soon happen here...

A HEALTHY OPTION

‘The cost of beef and lamb is going up and up – finding enough land to farm animals and meet demand is getting more and more difficult,’ says Gates, 45, who is also a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet.

‘Insects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish. Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals.

‘Added to this, insect-rearing requires less space and generates less pollution than livestock.’

Patrick Durst, senior forestry officer at the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, has been carrying out studies into the worldwide use of insects as a food source.

He says: ‘Western society tends to think of insects as being dirty but the nutritional benefits are many – crickets are rich in iron, zinc and calcium, for instance.

‘In Asia, people go into supermarkets to buy packets of crickets, silk worms or water bugs from the freezer section. They are foods of choice. Even though many insects are fried and sold as snack food to drink with beer, they are much healthier than a packet of crisps.’

Healthy grub: Crickets are a great source of calcium - but it may take a while before they're available at McDonald's or Sainsbury's

JUST ADD SOY SAUCE

Durst admits that persuading Europe to
start eating bugs will be an uphill struggle, but says:

‘Look at the 
way sushi has been accepted on to menus and even as a takeaway snack. 
That would have been unheard of 20 years ago.’

Gates
agrees: ‘Humans have been eating insects for thousands of years.

'It’s 
estimated that up to 2,000 species are available worldwide as a human 
food source, from beetles and spiders to ants and crickets.

'In Thailand,
I visited a school where children ate fried crickets for lunch.’

Gates
went hunting red ants and, despite his initial revulsion, admits: ‘Add 
some coriander, spring onion and soy sauce and the taste was incredible,
zesty and creamy and absolutely delicious.’

What impressed him most was
that bugs were responsible for sustaining communities.

He discovered 
this when he joined a group of  14-year-old boys in Cambodia to go 
tarantula-hunting.

‘The spiders provide a vital source of protein and it
is part of the only main meal they will have all day,’ he says.

TRY IT ON THE KIDS

After the tarantulas are dug out of their nests in the ground with wooden poles, the insects are then grilled for up to 30 minutes.

‘They tasted very like prawn or crab and were actually delicious,’ says Gates.

‘There aren’t enough tarantulas  to feed the world but the fact that they are so important to the diet of these boys highlights what an important food source insects can be.’

Despite this, it still seems rather a stretch to imagine we will soon be buying mealworm burgers from McDonald’s.

The key, says Gates, is in the presentation.

‘As long as people are fully aware of what they’re buying, there is great potential in adding edible insects protein into supplements and processed foods.

‘I bought packets of mealworms online to cook for my children and we’ve even experimented with earthworms and wood lice.

‘Because they are young, they see trying them as an adventure.

‘It is only by encouraging youngsters to try them and prove that they actually taste good that we  are going to be able to encourage more widespread use of insects  in our diet.’

BEER AND CRICKETS

Gates adds: ‘When you think about it, we already eat some strange things – take cheese with mould, and lobsters – but we don’t find that odd.

‘Maybe it will start in the pubs with something like crickets as a snack food.

‘Then it will have to be marketed cleverly as an eco-choice.

'I can easily see a time when we will be able to buy mealworm burgers in the freezer sections of supermarkets but sold as a ‘‘green’’ burger and packaged to appeal to those who prioritise health and the environment when it comes to food-buying.

‘If it is edible, good for you and tasty, why the heck not make it a part of the British way of life?’

Can Eating Insects Save The World?, part of BBC4’s Alien Nation season, starts on March 11
