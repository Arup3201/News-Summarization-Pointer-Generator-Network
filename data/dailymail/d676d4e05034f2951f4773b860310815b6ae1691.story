Milovan Farronato, pictured outside court today, has been cleared of racially aggravated assault

A cross-dressing art curator accused of punching a manager at the Groucho Club and calling her a 'f***ing fat, Polish b****' has been cleared of racially aggravated assault. 

Milovan Farronato was alleged to have punched Agnieszka Sikorska when she refused him entry to the trendy central London nightclub because he wasn't a member.

The 41-year-old Italian art curator denied the charge and was today acquitted at Westminster Crown Court after a one day hearing.

Speaking afterwards he said he was 'delighted' the case had been settled.

Ms Sikorska claimed she was left with a cut nose after being punched by Mr Farronato, who is the director of the Fiorucci Art Trust, on May 9 last year. 

The court was told the  41-year-old had tried to gain access to a section of the bar that had been reserved for members only when the incident occurred.

He and some friends had earlier attended a party at the Soho nightclub when they tried to enter the restricted bar, the prosecution claimed. 

Mr Farronato denied her allegations, instead claiming he had been told to leave the exclusive nightclub because he was wearing women's clothes, full make-up and 12inch high heels.

He admitted slapping the Polish manager as an act of 'instinctive' self-defence but denied racially abusing her beforehand. 

He also accepted possibly causing the cut on her nose with the 'thick' he was wearing at the time and said he told the woman she had 'terrible hair'.

Passing sentence District Judge Tan Ikram said he could not be sure which party was telling the truth and so found the defendant not guilty. 

'The prosecution called only one witness and what they are saying to me is that I can exclude the possibility that she wasn't telling the truth.

'They are saying that this woman had been working there for 10 years and she wouldn’t lie,' he said. 

'I cannot do that in this case because I have inconsistent evidence and I think it is significant inconsistent evidence.

'What probably happened I would not like to say. Can I be sure it happened the way the Crown say it happened? The answer is no.

'Because I cannot be sure that you didn't act in self-defence I find you not guilty.'

Speaking after the hearing Mr Farronato said he was relieved to have been acquitted. 

Self-defence: The art curator says he was discriminated against because he was wearing women's clothing

'I’m delighted, it’s been a very difficult day for me.

'This sort of thing has never happened to me before - thank God it’s over.

'I was confident that what I was saying was real and this was reflected but I couldn't be sure I would be believed.'

The Groucho Club - named after Groucho Marx - was founded in the 1980s as an alternative to London's traditional gentlemen's clubs.

It is known for the hell-raising behaviour of members including Lily Allen, Tracy Emin, Noel Gallagher, Stephen Fry and Rachel Weisz.

Earlier Ms Sikorska wept as she claimed that Farronato punched her 'two or three times' on the nose after calling her a 'f****** Polish fat b****' during the 1am confrontation.

She said that the curator and his friends were 'quite loud and noisy and not very nice to staff', so she asked them to leave but they said they had to get a drink of water first.

After she again insisted that Farronato leave, she said, 'He grabbed my hair and there were two or three hits. I didn't know what was happening.'

Ms Sikorska added: 'The next thing I remember I was behind the bar with two guys who were cleaning my face and putting a napkin with ice on it.'

Ms Welsh asked: 'Were you able to see how the defendant hit you? Was it open or closed?' The witness replied: 'I think it was closed.'

The court was shown a picture of Ms Sikorska's bloody nose and swollen eye following the attack.

'When I was a kid I lost my eye, so I already have got half of my face looking this way,' she said. 'After being attacked I have more scars and look worse than I already did.'

Farronato, who appeared in court wearing red lipstick, eyeliner, a leather jacket decorated with hearts and high heels, said he felt 'discriminated' against because of the way he was dressed.

Venue: The fight took place at the Groucho Club in Soho, known for members' hell-raising antics

He denied that he had asked where she was from or called her a 'fat b****', claiming that he slapped her in self-defence after she hit him when he insulted her hair.

The defendant told the court: 'I said she had terrible hair since it was covering her face and that it was difficult to speak to her.'

Asked what happened next, he said: 'She slapped me immediately just after I said that sentence, on my left cheek. I slapped her back in self-defence. It was an instinctive, defensive reaction just to say, "Stop please, don't go further."'

Farronato accepted that he was responsible for the cut on the bridge of Ms Sikorska's nose, but claimed it had probably been caused by a large silver ring he was wearing.

'It is very thick - I was not targeting anything, I was just responding instinctively and probably the back of the ring touched her nose and because of that she was injured,' he said.

The defendant said that he had had one glass of wine and two vodka tonics before the incident and accepted he was not entirely sober, but he denied that he lost his temper or that he had hit Ms Sikorska with a closed fist.

'I have never lost my temper in my life, I am a university professor and I get on well with people,' he told the court. 

Asked about his work, Farronato said he curates art exhibitions and lectures on art at a university in Venice.
