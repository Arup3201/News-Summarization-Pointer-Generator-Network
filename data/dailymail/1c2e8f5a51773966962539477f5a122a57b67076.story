Scepticism about the benefits system has increased more among Labour voters than Tories in recent years, a major survey found yesterday.

Nearly half of Labour supporters, 46 per cent, think benefit cuts would encourage claimants to ‘stand on their feet’ and find work. That compares to the 16 per cent who favoured cuts in 1987 when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister.

And it is more than the 43 per cent of Conservative voters who believed in 1989 that if benefits were less generous more people would provide for themselves.

Now, 68 per cent of Tories think benefits are too high and encourage dependency.

In 1989, 46 per cent of Labour supporters thought social injustice was the main cause of poverty. By 2010, despite the recession, only 27 per cent did.

The plunging support for the benefits system emerged in a survey for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It said in a report that the gap on welfare between Tory and Labour supporters is narrowing.

The findings will concern Ed Miliband, who has opposed Coalition welfare reforms including the £500 a week benefits cap. Senior figures in his own party think he is out of touch with voters.

In particular Mr Miliband objected to Chancellor George Osborne’s questions over why the lifestyle of Mick Philpott, convicted of killing six of his children in a fire, was supported by state benefits.

In advance of the local elections earlier this month, the Labour leader attacked Mr Osborne, saying he was exploiting the deaths and asking if it was right to ‘say to people that this is somehow a common truth about people on benefits.’

The Joseph Rowntree report found that 46 per cent of Labour voters now believe that ‘people would stand on their feet if benefits were cut’.

It said that a ‘general hardening of attitudes to welfare has continued through the past few decades.’

The report continued: ‘The view that poverty is caused by individual rather than societal factors has increased most markedly among Labour supporters, as has the view that welfare recipients are undeserving and that the welfare state encourages dependence.’

The survey questions were asked on Rowntree’s behalf in 2011 by NatCen Social Research among more than 3,300 people.

‘Results were ready for publication last month but were delayed, although Joseph Rowntree denied that they had been held back until after the local government elections.’

The 46 per cent backing among Labour supporters for welfare cuts compares with 16 per cent of Labour supporters who favoured cuts when asked the same question in 1987.

In the recession of the early 1990s, only 21 per cent of Labour supporter thought unemployed people could find a job if they wanted one. in 2011, in the depths of the current recession, that had more than doubled to 50 per cent.

Nearly half Labour supporters, 46 per cent, thought in 1989 that injustice was the main cause of poverty. By 2010 only 27 per cent did so.

The report said: ‘The view that the generosity of welfare benefits encourages dependence has become more prevalent; much of this change occurred when the Labour Party was in office and economic circumstances appear to have had little impact.

‘Changes in attitudes have been concentrated among the youngest in society and Labour Party supporters.’

The percentage of Labour supporters who now think that cutting welfare benefits would force people to stand on their feet is higher than the share of Tory voters who thought the same thing when Margaret Thatcher was in power.

In 1989 only 43 per cent of Conservative voters believed that if benefits were less generous more people would provide for themselves.

Now more than two thirds of Tories, 68 per cent, think benefits are too high and encourage dependency.

The gap on welfare between Tory and Labour supporters is narrowing, the report said.

Liberal Democrat voters are less persuaded that benefits encourage dependency. Only 40 per cent said they thought less generous benefits would encourage people to look after themselves.
