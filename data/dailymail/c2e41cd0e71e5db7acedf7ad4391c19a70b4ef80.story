Happy Holiday Netflix users, the site is live and running again.

Netflix said Tuesday it had fully restored its
video-streaming service after a Christmas Eve outage infuriated many of its

In a post on the company’s Twitter account, Netflix wrote: ‘Special thanks to our awesome members for being patient. We're back to normal streaming levels. We hope everyone has a great holiday.’

Malfunction: Families across the United States were forced to rely on sources of entertainment other than holiday movies after Netflix's video streaming service crashed on Christmas eve

Families across the United States were 
forced to rely on sources of entertainment other than holiday movies 
after Netflix's video streaming service crashed on Christmas eve.

The Los Gatos, California-based company said the outage was due to a technical problem at Amazon.com’s Amazon Web Services, which Netflix uses for its video-streaming functions

Netflix said Monday it was working with Amazon engineers to restore the outage, which stretched 'across the Americas.'

The problems started at about 3:30 p.m., and users began grumbling via Twitter about their loss of service.

'My Netflix isn't working. I THOUGHT THE END OF THE WORLD WASN'T COMING,' wrote @soundlyawake.

Netflix users vented on Twitter when they discovered the video streaming service was down

Filmmaker and producer Judd Apatow tweeted, 'I was planning on staying up all night and watching #Netflix. Just found out its been down for 10 hours! #christmasisruined.'

Many users groaned about having to talk to their families after the streaming service went down on the holiday. 

@MyNameisRazzle2 wrote, 'Netflix is down, most likely overloaded... Which means I'm not the only one bored as hell at his parents house.'

Added Kayla Brons: 'As if being an only child isn't boring enough, Netflix is down. I don't want to complain... but this is an outrage!!'

This is the third time this year that an Amazon outage has caused problems for Netflix, according to Wired magazine.

Around 7:30 p.m. Christmas Eve, the Netflix wrote on its Twitter page, 'We're sorry for the Christmas Eve outage. Terrible timing! Engineers are working on it now. Stay tuned to @Netflixhelps for updates.'
