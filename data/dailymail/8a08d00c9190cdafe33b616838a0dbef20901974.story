The mother of an Oakland teen who was declared brain dead after having tonsil surgery in December - and then became the focus of a struggle between her family and the hospital over whether to keep her on life support - is speaking out for the first time in over a month.

In the letter, sent via-Facebook to KTVU Channel 2 news anchor Frank Somerville, 13-year-old Jahi McMath's mother, Nailah Winkfield, thanked those who have supported her during her struggle to keep her daughter alive.

Additionally, she says that her daughter is alive and not suffering - now that she's been moved from the Children's Hospital Oakland to a long-term care facility.

'I have been surrounded by the love, 
support and prayers of so many kind people,' Winkfield says in the letter. 'Despite what people say 
about my daughter being dead and how I must be ignorant not to get that,
 I can tell you that she is much better physically since she has left 
Children's Hospital and I see changes that give me hope.'

McMath was declared brain dead following a tonsil surgery intended to help the girl's sleep apnea on December 9.

Following the surgery, the girl suffered tremendous blood loss and went into cardiac arrest. The poor circulation as a result of the severe blood loss caused injuries to her brain that doctors considered to be fatal.

It has been over a month since I have spoken about my life with Jahi to anyone outside a very small circle of family and friends. So many people have asked how we are doing and if Jahi is alive.

This has and continues to be an unbelievably difficult time for me as a mother and for us as a family. I have withdrawn for reasons of safety and privacy and to focus on my daughter and my role as her mother.

However, I have not been alone. I have been surrounded by the love, support and prayers of so many kind people. Despite what people say about my daughter being dead and how I mustbe ignorant not to get that, I can tell you that she is much better physically since she has left Children's Hospital and I see changes that give me hope.

As I prayed today, I felt called to express to people that I am truly grateful for the amount of love and support my daughter Jahi McMath and I have received from people all over the world. We feel your prayer and support. Because of your unselfish generosity I was able to do what I was afraid I would never be able to do, move my daughter from Children's Hospital Oakland before they removed her from her ventilator and stopped her heart. This was itself a miracle. Please know that all of thesupport we received has been used towards helping Jahi.

If I had it my way, I would say thank you to each and every person in their native language so they could understand how much I appreciate them for all their support and, most importantly, prayers. It is my belief that faith in God, your prayers, and the incredible kindness of good hearted medical professionals, are the main reasons my daughter is alive today. I know people are concerned and I want to make sure you know that Jahi is not suffering, she is surrounded by love. I will never let her suffer.

On the long hard days when I'm feeling down, I think about all the people who are praying for me and Jahi and I feel so much better. I want you to know that I'm praying for you as well.

Thank you to all of the people who view my daughter as the sweet, innocent, 13-year-old girl that she is and not a dead body or a corpse, I deeply appreciate that. Thank you to everyone who hasn't forgot how my daughter got into this situation in the first place. No one should have to go through this.

I would like to thank all of the people who have reached out to me and shared their stories of their family members. Some have been heartbreaking. Some have given me hope. All have helped me feel that I am not the only person who has had this struggle. Some of you have shared how you fought for your loved ones and they got better, some of you have shared your regret with not fighting more and some shared with me the incredibly difficult decisions you made to let go. I have prayed for you as you have for me. Sadly, I can say I know how you feel.

I also want to thank those who felt the need to go public with their opinions about me and my daughter, positive and even negative. It is because of you that my daughter's experience is so relevant and that people all over the world know who Jahi Mcmath is. What you may not know is that her name, Jahi, means one who is known by many. Hopefully my daughter can change some of the ways brain death is viewed in today's society. Honestly, I think she already has.

Finally, thank you for all the love, support and prayers you give Jahi every day. I am certain that she knows you are praying for her. I feel the support from your prayer all the time. I don't think I or Jahi would be here today without you. May God bless all who have shown love and compassion as well as those who have expressed their contempt. All are deserving of God's grace and love. For those who believe, please, keep praying for Jahi. God can overcome all things and I believe that His will has yet to be fully revealed. I love Jahi and where there is love, there is hope.

On December 12, doctors declared the 
girl brain dead and sought a medical declaration of death for the 
13-year-old. Her family, however, refused to accept the doctors' 
decision to declare the girl dead - while technically brain dead, the 
girl's organs were being kept alive by machines.

The disagreement led to court proceedings to determine whether the family had the right to keep McMath on life support.

The
 family petitioned the Alameda County Superior Court to step in when 
doctors wanted to take McMath off of life support. The court then 
appointed Paul Graham Fisher, the
 chief of Child Neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine, to 
give a second opinion on the girl's condition.

Fisher
 agreed with the doctors at Children's Hospital, noting that McMath had 
no activity on an electroencephalogram, no blood flow to the brain and 
she was unable to breathe on her own.

Winkfield
 appealed the decision to take her daughter off of life support, and the
 court gave her an extension that required the hospital to keep her on a
 ventilator until January 7.

The court, however, denied a request to give McMath a feeding tube or a tracheostomy.

On January 5, the hospital released McMath's body to the county coroner, which released the body to Winkfield.

McMath currently is being kept alive on life support at an undisclosed location.

Hope: This is the New Beginnings Center in Medway, Long Island, where the family of Jahi McMath hope to send her by private jet by January 7 in a bid to keep her alive

Winkfield and her family are now in a renewed race against time to get their little girl transferred to a facility willing to care for a legally dead patient

'I am just thanking God and everyone who has supported us. I am going to fight with everything I have got,' Winkfield said Monday

Struggle: Jahi's family is pitted against a hospital they've called uncaring in their struggle to keep the brain dead teen hooked to life support. Here, Children's Hospital of Oakland spokesman Sam Singer updates reporters on Jahi's condition December 30. Doctors contend she has no possibility of ever waking up

Precautions: Officials saw to it that the door to the Children's Hospital of Oakland was barricaded Monday in preparation for Jahi's family's press conference

Tragedy: Jahi McMath, 13, was declared legally 
brain-dead after undergoing a routine tonsil removal that dosctors 
suggested as a means of eliminating her sleep apnea

Last photos: Mrs Winkfield snapped this picture of daughter Jahi the morning she took her to the hospital to undergo a tonsillectomy that ended up all but ending her life

Unexpected: After coming out of surgery, Jahi 
started bleeding from the mouth and was eventually ruled brain-dead. The 
hospital that performed the procedure no longer wants to keep the girl 
on life support
