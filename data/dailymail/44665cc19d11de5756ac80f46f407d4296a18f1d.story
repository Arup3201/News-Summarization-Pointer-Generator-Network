The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity is fighting back against claims that racism is stitched into the fabric of the fraternity - by mandating that all members of the organization undergo 'diversity training.'  

One of the University of Oklahoma students who took part in the infamous racist chant wrote that 'the song was taught to us,' passed down through an unknown number of generations at the Oklahoma chapter before finally being exposed.

On Wednesday, the fraternity's executive director Blaine Ayers announced changes aimed at making SAE more inclusive, including diversity training and a review of every chapter's behavior.

'The chant in the video is ugly. It is demoralizing and absolutely counter to the values of SAE,' Ayers said at a press conference in Chicago, describing his own disgust at the video.

Though the fraternity is currently headquartered in Evanston, Illinois, it was founded at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, five years before the beginning of the Civil War.

The University of Oklahoma expelled two members and suspended the fraternity last week, though the chapter has retained a lawyer, Stephen Jones, who defended Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh.

Ayers laid out several steps the fraternity would take nationwide in order to 'ensure that this never happens again.'

'We are focused on trying to determine the root of this song or this chant, where it came from, that's our primary focus,' said Ayers, who stated he had never heard the chant. 

Diversity training program will be mandated for SAE members, and the fraternity has set up a hotline that will allow people to confidentially report inappropriate conduct, he added. 

Bad light: The recording showed a bus driving to an SAE function as two members led the chant, which mentioned lynching black people and declared there would 'never be a n***** in SAE'

Bad boys: The Los Angeles Times reported that SAE's chapters have faced numerous disciplinary sanctions for their actions, including the drinking death of a pledge  in 2008 at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo

In addition to new programs in the fraternity, Ayers said the fraternity will appoint a director and national advisory committee for diversity and inclusion.

The fraternity will also conduct and investigation of all 237 of its chapters to identify bigoted behaviors and prepare a report, the executive director added. 

3 percent of SAE members identify as African-American, and 20 percent as non-white, according to data the fraternity began collecting in 2013.

That 20 percent 'is a number we would like to increase,' Ayers said, though the target number was not given.

It remains to be seen whether minority students have been turned off SAE for good after the video of the racist chant surfaced.

The second-ever black member of the Oklahoma chapter, William Bruce James II, expressed the heartbreak he felt after seeing the video.

'There will never be another black SAE,' he wrote in Quartz. 'I wish there had been one less.' 

'Counting heads isn't going to tell you much about cultural change,' said Ben Reese, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.

'It strikes me as a response to crisis,' said Reese, who reviewed the SAE plan. 'I hope the crisis response will evolve into a thoughtful process that brings in a number of stakeholders on campus.'  

SAE has followed recent scandals with nationwide change in its chapters, becoming the first fraternity of its size to eliminate the pledging process, after reports surfaced of hazing. 

On Wednesday night, a call to the fraternity's hotline rang several times before returning a recording asking the caller to leave a message.
