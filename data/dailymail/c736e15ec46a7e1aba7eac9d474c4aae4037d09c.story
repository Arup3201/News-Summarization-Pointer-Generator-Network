Her sister may be lapping up the Sydney sunshine today, but Pippa Middleton headed to her Chelsea stomping ground to make the most of the glorious weather over here.

She shops there, parties there - and even shared a flat with her sister Kate there before she married Prince William - and today, Pippa returned to the upmarket London borough for a stroll in the sun.

Pippa wore a stylish yet low-key 
ensemble, teaming jeans and a black top with a trendy £396 blue coat 
with black lapels by Sarah Berman, which she purchased in 2011.

Out and about: Pippa Middleton took a sunny stroll around Chelsea this afternoon

Practical as ever, Pippa opted for flat footwear in the form of brown boots, which matched her accompanying tan handbag.

She accessorised the outfit with a subtle gold necklace and wore what looked like a signet ring on her little finger.

Pippa hasn't been seen out in public since a shopping trip last month when she was spotted enjoying some retail therapy at the Carolina 
Herrera boutique in Knightsbridge, where the cheapest item is a pair of 
£189 sunglasses. Dresses can cost up to £3,194, while bags start at 
£450.

Casual cool: Pippa, 30, snapped her her Sarah Berman coat back in 2011 and proves she is just as thrifty as her sister Kate by wearing it today

Pippa, 30, appeared to be enjoying some down-time today after a busy March, which started with a romantic trip to the Austrian ski resort of Lech.

Accompanied by 36-year-old 
stockbroker Nico Jackson, she spent a week in the exclusive resort which is 
so glamorous that even the lifts are sponsored by Dior and Chanel.

She
met Nico, who grew up in a red-brick terraced house in Folkestone 
before making his millions at Deutsche Bank, on a previous skiing trip.

Since
 then, her career as a columnist for Vanity Fair and the Telegraph has 
occupied most of her time, with Ms Middleton finding time to write columns for both publications.

Her
 most recent effort included a recipe for rocket and mascarpone penne, which is apparently a 
Middleton family favourite - and, according to Pippa, just the thing post-exercise.
