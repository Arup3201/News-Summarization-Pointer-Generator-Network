He and another aid worker, Nancy Writebol, are being treated in an isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.

Dr Kent Brantly, an American aid worker in Liberia who contracted Ebola, is pictured returning to the U.S. last Saturday. He released a statement on Friday saying 'he's getting stronger every day'

Dr Brantly, pictured working in Liberia, was given an experimental treatment for Ebola which has never been used on humans. It is unknown whether it has played a part in his improved condition

In a statement, Dr Brantly said: I am writing this update from my isolation room at Emory University Hospital, where the doctors and nurses are providing the very best care possible.

'I am growing stronger every day, and I thank God for His mercy as I have wrestled with this terrible disease.

'I also want to extend my deep and sincere thanks to all of you who have been praying for my recovery as well as for Nancy (Writebol) and for the people of Liberia and West Africa.

'My wife Amber and I, along with our two children, did not move to Liberia for the specific purpose of fighting Ebola. We went to Liberia because we believe God called us to serve Him at ELWA Hospital.'

The doctor also revealed the strain of caring for those who succumbed to the deadly disease. Ebola kills 90 per cent of people who contract it and there is no known cure.  

Dr Brantly wrote: 'One thing I have learned is that following God often leads us to unexpected places. When Ebola spread into Liberia, my usual hospital work turned more and more toward treating the increasing number of Ebola patients. I held the hands of countless individuals as this terrible disease took their lives away from them. I witnessed the horror firsthand, and I can still remember every face and name.

'When I started feeling ill on that Wednesday morning, I immediately isolated myself until the test confirmed my diagnosis three days later. When the result was positive, I remember a deep sense of peace that was beyond all understanding. God was reminding me of what He had taught me years ago, that He will give me everything I need to be faithful to Him.

'Now it is two weeks later, and I am in a totally different setting. My focus, however, remains the same—to follow God. As you continue to pray for Nancy and me, yes, please pray for our recovery. More importantly, pray that we would be faithful to God’s call on our lives in these new circumstances.' 

Dr Brantly was transferred amid high security to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Saturday which is fitted out with one of the most sophisticated containment facilities in America.

He was pictured being helped out of a special ambulance in a hazmat suit and walking into the hospital. 

Mrs Writebol's husband, David, who remains in Liberia, told reporters on Friday in a call organized by aid group SIM USA his wife appears to be improving.

David Writebol said he was also thankful for the ‘marvelous’ care his wife received in Liberia before traveling to Atlanta and is grateful that she is now in a place where she can receive the best care possible. 

Few details have been released about the specific conditions of the patients.

Nancy Writebol, an American aid worker from North Carolina who was infected with the Ebola virus while working in Liberia, arrives at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Tuesday. Her husband confirmed today that her condition is also improving 

Nancy Writebol and her husband David were undertaking missionary work in Liberia when she contracted Ebola while helping those suffering from the disease 

The aid groups referred questions to Emory, which has declined comment, citing patient privacy.

David Writebol said since his wife arrived in Atlanta, she has received another dose of a treatment that's still in development and hasn't been tested in humans.

Thel drug called ZMapp is made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. of San Diego. It is aimed at boosting the immune system's efforts to fight off Ebola and is made from antibodies produced by lab animals exposed to parts of the virus.

At least one of the affected countries, Nigeria, has requested access to the experimental drug ZMapp, used on the two American aid workers.

U.S. health officials have stressed that only extremely limited doses exist, the drug hasn't ever been tested in people and there's no proof it helped the two Americans. 

However the FDA has since 'verbally confirmed' changes to the hold that may allow the company to make the drug available, although it has yet to be proven as safe and effective.   

Despite the positive news from Dr Brantly on Friday, the World Health Organisation has declared that Africa's Ebola outbreak is spreading beyond the control of top medics and poses a serious threat to the rest of the globe.

Four West African nations have recorded almost 1,800 cases as bodies were left in the streets and at least 961 people have died - including 80 medics.

Today WHO's director-general declared the outbreak is moving 'faster than we can control it' as it emerged another 29 people have died in just two days.
