Ed Miliband was accused of ‘clutching at straws’ last night, as he claimed the squeeze on living standards will continue until 2020.

The Labour leader dismissed mounting evidence of a sustained economic recovery and suggested millions on middle incomes will continue to suffer for years.

Party sources said Mr Miliband will use a speech in Birmingham today to ‘ridicule’ Government claims that the economy is on the mend.

Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed middle class families were not enjoying the benefits of a return to growth

Nick Clegg last night accused Mr Miliband of desperation.

The
 Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘Ed Miliband is clutching at straws and now
 he’s down to his last one. Instead of making specious claims, the 
Labour party should take responsibility for the past.’

Mr
 Miliband cited forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility 
suggesting average earnings will lag behind economic growth until at 
least 2018. He said the cost-of-living crisis ‘will continue for the 
five years of the next Parliament’ unless action is taken to ensure the 
rewards of economic growth are spread more evenly.

Official figures show the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2013, the fourth quarter of growth in a row

Middle class families weathered the 
recession by shopping in cheaper supermarkets, using grandparents for 
free childcare and taking on extra jobs, a report published today 
reveals.

Households in the 
social group became ‘very good’ at adapting their spending and 
employment in order to ride out the crisis, says research by a 
think-tank.

Some even managed to move into a higher income bracket despite the economic downturn, the Social Market Foundation said.

More 
women went out to work as families sought to make ends meet, with the 
proportion of double-income households rising from 35 per cent to 49 per
 cent.

An analysis of 
household income also found that the middle classes became bargain 
seekers, switching stores and hunting out cheaper deals to avoid the 25 
per cent increase in food prices.

And
 there was also a dramatic rise in the number of people using the 
generosity of grandparents and other relatives to help with childcare to
 cut the cost of a childminder or nursery.

Middle earners are now using 20 per cent more ‘free’ care for the under-twos than they were in 2007, says the report.

Around
 one in five families deemed middle income in 2008 – with a net income 
of between £26,100 and £41,200 – fell down the income scale as a result 
of the financial crisis.

But two-fifths stayed where they were, and the remaining two-fifths have since climbed into the higher brackets.

‘The
 middle class – once the solid centre of our economy – is being hollowed
 out, with growing insecurity and the prospect, for the first time since
 the war, that their children will be worse off than they were,’ he 
added.

Mr Miliband will today call for local councils to be placed in charge of drawing up their own economic plans.

He
 will pledge to give cities powers over £20billion of housing, transport
 and skills funding to help close the productivity gap between the 
capital and other parts of the country.

‘We
 need a prosperous London, but we also need to build prosperity outside 
it,’ he will say. ‘Today, every region outside London is below the 
national average when it comes to productivity, while London is 40 per 
cent above it.

‘Britain will never tackle the cost-of-living crisis … unless we break this pattern and reverse a century of centralisation.’ 

But
 Mr Miliband’s wider argument on the economy was undermined by a Social 
Market Foundation report yesterday which revealed that most middle-class
 families have weathered the recession well. Around a fifth of families 
classed as having a middle income in 2008 – those with net earnings of 
between £26,000 and £41,200 – slipped down the income scale as a result 
of the financial crisis.

But two-fifths have stayed where they were and a further two-fifths have moved up to a higher income group.

Emran Mian, director of the Social Market Foundation, said: ‘In reality, the middle  has coped surprisingly well since 2007-8.’

In
 a further blow to Labour’s analysis, a report by accountants KPMG today
 shows that starting salaries are rising at their fastest rate since 
2007.

Mr Clegg said the Labour leadership had ‘spent the last four years praying that the recovery would not materialise’.

He added: ‘For a long time they insisted that the Coalition’s action to tackle the deficit would choke off growth.

‘Wrong
 – the deficit has been eliminated by a third and growth is back. Then 
they claimed unemployment would rise by a million. Wrong – unemployment 
is coming down and we are seeing record numbers of people in work.’
