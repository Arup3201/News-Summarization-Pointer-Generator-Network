It is not what how you would expect a bulldog to behave, but Gabe is no ordinary canine.

The four-and-a-half stone bulldog has become an internet hit after owner Cheryl Knapp posted videos of his incredible tricks.

He can flush a toilet, ride a skateboard, and even fetch milk from the fridge

Born just before Christmas 2006, the two parents gave Gabe genes that ensure he is perfect for obedience training.

In November, he earned the second leg of his Utility Dog title, the highest level of obedience.

What Cheryl considers Gabe’s most unique trick, however, is his ability to ride a child’s rocking horse.

Diagnosed with cancer at just fourteen years old, she was warned that it was unlikely she would live past high school.

She
 said on Gabe’s personal website: ‘My near-death experience has brought 
out a tenacity and love of life in me, and has helped make me a person 
who thrives on tackling challenges. I love to do things ‘outside the 
box.’

Cheryl added that she is unable to afford training classes for her dogs, and that God has given her a ‘rather strange (and enjoyable) gift.’

Rocking horse: Gabe casually walks up to the horse and adjusts it so that he can climb

Flexible: He lifts one leg on the the foothold and launches her other leg over the rocking horse

Agility: Gabe swings his body back and forth to the ride the horse as a child would

No hands: The show-off has incredible balance and can remain on the horse using only his legs

She starts training the dogs when they are puppies and their skills are learned at feeding times throughout the day.

She said: ‘Bulldogs don’t like a lot of repetition, and are too smart to ‘work for free’, so they respond readily to these "mini practice sessions".

‘My dogs line up in a set order when their food is prepped – when a release word is given, they race to their assigned bowls.’
