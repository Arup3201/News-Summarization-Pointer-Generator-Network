Lampard has experienced playing in the hot and humid conditions in the past and says Roy Hodgson and his coaching team have prepared the squad very well to deal with the conditions.

He added: 'I played pre-season in Miami and different conditions around the world. I’ve been impressed with what Roy and staff have tried to do. You have to cover every base.

'The humidty and conditions can suck a bit out of your legs. The acclimatisation helps. No excuses, we’re playing Italy and they have to get used to the conditions.'

Speaking of Wednesday's opponents, Lampard said: 'We know they have good players. We know Antonio Valencia who plays in the Premier League.

'It’s more about getting accustomed to the different styles. For us it’s good to come up against a South American style. We’re concentrating on the improvements we can make and take to Brazil.'
