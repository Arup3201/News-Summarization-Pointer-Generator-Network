Mattel's limited-edition Karl Lagerfeld Barbie hit Net-a-Porter early Monday morning, and by 5am the doll was sold out.

The online retailer sold 999 dolls at $200 each. The Barbie is dressed exactly like the 80-year-old designer himself.

Those who were lucky enough to snap up the coveted collector's item have already begun re-selling it on eBay.

Her accessories include a wide necktie, black ankle boots, fingerless gloves and Mr Lagerfeld's signature sunglasses.

In July, Kim Culmone, Global Vice President of Barbie product design, told Women's Wear Daily: 'It’s not every day that Barbie dresses like the world’s most famous fashion designer.'

The Barbie isn't the only item to inspire a craze among the Chanel creative director's fans this year.

In July, more than 600 fashionistas were on the waiting list for Fendi's Bag Boy Karlito - a pom-pom-esque charm designed to resemble Mr Lagerfeld's style with black mink 'sunglasses' and a silver fox 'torso.'

Signature style: Karl Lagerfeld often wears a tailored black jacket, black skinny jeans and sunglasses, just as the doll does

Mr Lagerfeld recently revealed details of his beloved pet's luxurious life in a lifestyle book, Choupette: The Private Life of a High-Flying Fashion Cat.

The designer's fluffy feline is also the inspiration for both an upcoming fashion line and a holiday make-up collection for Shu Uemura.
