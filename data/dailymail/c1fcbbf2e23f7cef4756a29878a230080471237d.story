Eco warriors who have built a 20ft high tower as they prepare for eviction by bailiffs have warned they 'will not go quietly.' 

The activists were ordered to leave their community farm by today after losing a long-running legal battle with millionaire entrepreneur and landowner Brian Bennett.

But members of the Yorkley Court Community Farm appear to be preparing for battle.

Eco warriors at Yorkley Court Community Farmhave built a 20ft high tower as they prepare for eviction by bailiffs

The activists claim the tower is 'an art exhibition' but a message on their website warns 'We are here, we are determined and we will not leave quietly'

The row began after a group of squatters moved in on the dilapidated land in the Forest of Dean two-and-a-half years ago and began growing vegetables.

Activists, who are affiliated to the ‘Reclaim the Fields’ network, have run the ecologically friendly community farm ever since with the aims of 'teaching people about access to land, building communities and re-localising the food system.’

But Mr Bennett, who bought the land for development, had objected to the unauthorised set-up and last month the group were finally ordered to vacate by Gloucester and Cheltenham County Court. 

Since the eviction notice, the squatters have built a giant defensive tower out of wood and corrugated metal, and have appealed for ‘useful’ items including climbing rope, camouflage netting and jerry cans as well as for supporters to join them on the site.

One of the eco farmers, Lucy Winters, warned: ‘We are here, we are determined and we will not leave quietly.'

Make-shift towers have been used before by protesters to hinder bailiffs. At the notorious Dale Farm travellers’ site near Basildon, Essex, activists built a 40ft scaffolding tower and some chained themselves to it. 

But yesterday Gunter Tyrson, 33, spokesman for Yorkley Court Community Farm, claimed the tower was an 'art instillation'.

He said: ‘We have a tower as an art installation. It is to raise awareness of our cause.' 

Mr Tyrson added: ‘It’s an homage to our ancestors, to those who came before us and gave their lives trying to get access to the land, to men like John Ball a leader of the Peasants’ Revolt. Land is the basis of all human wealth, but it most of it is owned by a very few people.

‘We started the tower on Sunday and built it in three days. It is made from all natural materials and recycled wood. It is called ‘Community Before Profit Tower’ and evokes memories of the land rights struggle in this country.’

Mr Tyrson said all those living on the farm, who range from age two to 50, are waiting to see what the bailiffs do.

‘We are ready to talk to them as human beings. We have always been peaceful and inviting to the local community,’ he said.

Mr Tyrson, who has lived there since the community farm was first set up, said ‘gaining access to land’ allowed him to pursue his ‘career path’ as a ‘professional vegetable grower’.

A spokesman for the group said the towering wooden structure was built it in three days and had been called the ‘Community Before Profit Tower'

‘We remain committed to our belief that sustainable farming for the benefit of the local community is more important than greedy developers seeking profit with little regard for local people,’ he added. 

More than 1,100 people have signed an online petition backing the ‘community farm’. Some local residents have also voiced support for their vision of sustainable farming.

Mr Bennett, chairman of Vantage Point Business Village in Mitcheldean, Forest of Dean, has not put in any planning applications for use of the land and intends to keep it for agricultural purposes, his spokesman said yesterday. 

Gloucestershire Police is making preparations ahead of tomorrow's eviction and have asked the National Police Air Service to carry out occasional overflights to observe the size of the community on site. 

The group have appealed for ‘useful’ items including climbing rope, camouflage netting and jerry cans as well as for supporters to join them on the site

Another homemade tower at the infamous Dale Farm site

The tactics being employed at Yorkley Court Community Farm appear to be similar to those used during the infamous eviction of the Dale Farm traveller site.

Families, who had been illegally living on the site, had been ordered to leave the site in Essex by Basildon Council which voted to bring enforcement action in 2005.

By 2011 a lengthy legal battle between the High Court and Court of Appeal had been carried out.

By the time it came to finally evict the group in October 2011, protesters had turned Europe's largest illegal traveller site into a fortress.

Police had to scale scaffolding, despite facing a hail of bricks and being threatened with spades as two caravans were set on fire. In some cases officers had to use a cherry picker to get to the top of 40ft towers erected by the travellers.

Protesters had strapped themselves to buildings and scaffolding and some were chained by their necks to ruined vehicles filled with concrete.

Officers had to hacked through shabby fences and break through gates to get into the site but eventually, the protesters were removed.
