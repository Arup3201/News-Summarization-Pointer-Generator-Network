She started off in life as a beautician in Brentwood known for her vajazzling and waxing skills, but fast forward four years and Amy Childs is a millionaire thanks to her a successful boutique, salon and clothing business.

The reality TV star, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, is keen to make the most of her success and has released a transitional clothing line to meet the demand.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her new range, she said: 'We had to have emergency design meetings at the end of last year. We had to restock some of my styles three times and my Kendra dress sold out almost overnight. It was exciting but also stressful.'

She continued: 'I actually sat on Twitter and listened to our fans - they wanted pieces for the in-between season, they wanted flattering fits for post-Christmas and bold prints to spice up their winter wardrobe, so that’s what I’ve done. Their input means a lot to me.'

She added: ‘It’s all about the power outfit. It’s the pieces you put on and you instantly feel powerful, like you can crush your day and achieve what you want’.

Indeed, achieving her dreams is something Amy knows all about. 

'I’m so lucky to be where I am,' she admits. 'Before TOWIE I loved my fashion and was a beauty therapist. Now I am blessed enough to be doing what I love as a living and my businesses are employing 50 people who love it as much as I do.  

'To see the public’s positive response to my collections and beauty ranges is just unbelievable; just absolutely amazing.’

Amy takes her fans' opinions extremely seriously and maintains that she always listens to the public’s comments, tailoring her collections to meet their needs.

'I’m not just making dresses for a certain type or size of women like some other brands,' she said. 'I’m trying to make every woman that puts on my dress feel like she can conquer the world. 

'I even shot my last collection on a 50-year-old woman and she looked amazing; it’s not just a dress, it’s an attitude, it’s a self-belief’. 

Amy values the opinions of her fans and says to see the public's' positive response to her collections and beauty ranges is just 'unbelievable'
