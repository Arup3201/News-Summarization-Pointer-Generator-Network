The story of his long political life; embodiment of the spirit 
of New York and the colorful manner of 'Hizzoner' Ed Koch have been 
remembered since his death this month, but for the 
first time Koch the 19-year-old Army draftee has been 
revealed with the discovery of a secret diary.

A journal belonging to the former Mayor, when he was just a Bronx teenager training to serve in World War II, 
has been unearthed by his sister, Pat Thaler, and is revealed today. 

It shows Koch's early liberalism; firm stance against prejudice and his stubborn refusal to back down in a fight, three aspects of his character which came to represent his time in office.

'What struck me was that he was the same person then that he was at the 
end of his life,' Thaler, 80, told the New York Post today.

Koch was given the diary by his mother, Joyce, it was a leather bound book inscribed 'God bless you, my son.'

He filled it out during his days in basic training at Camp Croft, South Carolina, in 1943.

In it the man who famously went on to become New 
York mayor from 1978 to 1989 told of his arguments against prejudice in the armed 
forces - foreshadowing the kind of campaigns he would take on in his 
political life and showing his early belligerence in the face of those he disagreed with.

'Had an argument with several of the boys over anti-Negro prejudice, 
this led to arguments over Jews and the usual line,' he writes in one journal entry.

'The arguments Lee 
presented were very poor and ignorant. I know that he is very biased 
even though he covers it up with an air of friendliness. It’s a pity 
that there are so few liberals in the land and so many ignorant people. 
I’m referring to all the bigoted individuals who make up this country.'

In another passage written on August 21, he adds: 'All week long they have called
yiddy yiddy yiddy all the poor [GIs] who happen to be Jews. I couldn’t 
take it anymore today and when LaRue kept calling out that miserable 
epithet, I boiled and told him to meet me outside the supply room. I was
boiling inside and the whole company was out there to watch the fight. I
was beaten pretty badly — knocked down a couple of times and the Lt. 
wanted to stop the fight but I wouldn’t let him. Finally, he did. 
Strangely enough I’m not marked up which makes me feel pretty good. Even
though I took the beating, I’m glad I fought.'

In a WLIW television program, The Jews
of New York, Koch would later speak of his attachment to his faith and 
refusal to back down in the face of anti-semitism which he first 
encountered in the army.

'Jews have always thought that having 
someone elevated with his head above the grass was not good for the 
Jews. I never felt that way,' he told the program. 'I believe that you have to stand
up.'

He had Daniel Pearl's words engraved on his tombstone:  'My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am Jewish.'

Following his training, Ed Koch went on to serve in the 104th Infantry Division known as the Timberwolves.

He was deployed in France and his unit helped to liberate the Nordhausen/Dora-Mittelbau concentration camp in Germany.

He left the army with two battle stars and a combat infantry badge.

Thaler discovered the journal in a dresser drawer in Koch's West Village department following his death.

As well as revealing the more serious development of his political views, it also reveals his humor.

'Patrolling today,' the new soldier writes in one entry. 'Our object was to get out of a forest. We had to go 
from cover to cover. I hid behind a tree and assumed the prone position.
Lt. Reed came over with the Lt. Col. and said, 'Koch, on what side of a
tree do you aim from,' I said, 'On the right side.' He said, 'So what 
the hell are you doing on the left side?'

When Koch took over the city reporters covered him around the clock because of 'the 
Koch factor' - his ability to say something outrageous any place, any 
time - something he also seemed to get the hang of in his early life.

In another entry he notes: 'Full field inspection in the afternoon. The whole battalion set up their
shelter halfs in a line and displayed equipment. it took about an hour 
to get everything ready for display and then the Col. merely walked 
swiftly up and down the aisles and glanced at the tents once in a while.
It was the biggest example of a waste of time that I have ever seen in 
the Army.'

Other passages reveal his struggle adjusting to army life.

Remembered: Hundreds attended Ed Koch's funeral earlier this month including dozens of political friends such as Bill Clinton, pictured

'The chow (chili con carne) was terrible but I
scraped the plate. It will be a long time before I’ll get used to the 
open latrine. The fellows in the bunk are pretty good. I think that I’ll
get along fine. . . . The beer stinks, it leaves a taste in my mouth.'

It also reveals Koch's early love of the movies. The former mayor enjoyed a successful
career as a reviewer after he left office.

'Karl Marx had it all wrong,' he would later say. 'Religion is not the opiate of the masses. It’s the movies.'

'Went to main base and saw “Sahara.” Good but unbelievable — 10 men catching a battalion,' he writes in one entry.

'Had double date with Madison. I took Betty Lou Carnagie. We went to 
AAFSAT. Had supper in the PX and saw 'Flesh and Fantasy.' We made the 
late show 8-10. Got out at 10. We were going to miss bed check by traveling by bus so we took a cab back to Rollins $2.00', says another.

'Went to movies, 'Above Suspicion'. Grade B picture. Staying in tonight. 
Received package from home containing candy and rugelach plus a very 
handsome dog bracelet,' he adds.

Koch passed away at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital on February 1.

Hundreds of well-wishers, political colleagues and dignitaries as well as his family attended his funeral.

Mayor Bloomberg described Koch as 'a great mayor, a great man, and a great friend'.

'In elected office and as a private citizen, he was our most tireless, fearless, and guileless civic crusader,' he said.

'Through
his tough, determined leadership and responsible fiscal stewardship, Ed
helped lift the city out of its darkest days and set it on course for 
an incredible comeback. We will miss him dearly.'
