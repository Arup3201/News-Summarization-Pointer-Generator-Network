From a delicate dress crafted from roses to a flock of floral peacocks and a World War One trench, the designers of this year's spectacular Chelsea Flower Show gardens took inspiration from a wide range of sources.

The trench, which was among hundreds of exhibitions to feature at the show, took home one of the top awards after proving popular with the Royal Horticultural Society judges.

Featuring sandbags, tiny metal rats, colourful planting and a giant poppy fountain, it attracted the eyes of thousands of visitors as they toured the gardens.

And it even got the royal seal of approval when the Queen visited yesterday. As the monarch toured the garden, she stopped to note that it was a 
'rather nice trench' in contrast to the grim conditions that soldiers 
would have faced 100 years ago.

But 
despite Birmingham City Council's trench proving popular with judges, it was a sustainable 
take on the British country garden full of old-fashioned English flora 
that saw Hugo Bugg, 26, become one of the youngest ever winners of a gold medal 
at the show.

Overflowing
 with pretty native species, among them bluebells and hawthorn, Mr 
Bugg's creation was designed to show how storm water can be saved for 
use in the garden all year round.

Stunning though Mr Bugg's garden was, 
it wasn't the only one to impress the judges as Luciano Giubbilei's Laurent-Perrier Garden picked up Best 
In Show.

Other
 winners included the Mind’s Eye - a sensory garden by the RNIB - which 
won the best 'fresh' garden award, while the best artisan garden prize 
went to Japanese garden Togenkyo - A Paradise on Earth.

Gold medal winner: Hugo Bugg's 'Waterscape Garden' is a collaboration with the Royal Bank of Canada and overflows with traditional British blooms such as bluebells

The awards were handed out as the world famous flower show opened its doors to thousands of members of the public, who got to see the show in cooler weather than the scorching conditions of the past few days.

Alex 
Denman, RHS head of shows development, said: 'The RHS Chelsea Flower 
Show stands for the highest levels of horticultural excellence, and the 
exhibitors this year have demonstrated their incredible level of 
knowledge and ability with their fantastic exhibits.

'The
 achievement of Laurent-Perrier is fantastic. The attention to detail 
and evocative feel of the stunning garden from Luciano is a great 
tribute to his skill as well as the growers and landscapers who have 
contributed to their garden.'

A
 second show garden designed to commemorate World War I, complete with 
trenches, a mine crater pond and the yew trees found in war cemeteries, 
also picked up a gold medal.

The
 No Man’s Land ABF The Soldiers’ Charity Garden to mark the centenary of

inspiration from her grandfather who was injured on the first day of the
 Somme and a visit to the battlefields.

There were
 silver-gilt medals for first-time Chelsea designers Matthew Childs, who
 designed the Brewin Dolphin show garden, and Matthew Keightley, who 
drew on his brother’s experiences in the RAF Regiment in Afghanistan for
 the Help for Heroes garden.

Six
 show gardens got gold medals, along with three fresh gardens. The 
smaller, artisan, DialAFlight Potter’s Garden, which represented a rural
 potter going to fight in the First World War, also got gold.

fresh gardens and three artisan gardens, including the Viking Cruises 
Norse Garden which celebrates the Viking spirit of exploration and 
adventure.
