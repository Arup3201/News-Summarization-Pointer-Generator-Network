Young British sportscar driver Jann Mardenborough has been involved in a crash in a race in Germany which has resulted in the death of a spectator.

Mardenborough was competing in the VLN1 event at the Nurburgring Nordschliefe when his Nissan GT-R NISMO GT3 flipped up in the air as it crested a rise in the circuit.

With the nose of the car pointing up in the air, it soared for around 30 metres before landing on its tail and bouncing over the catch-fencing into a crowd of people.

Mardenborough is a 23-year-old who is currently competing in the  World Endurance Championship

Mardenborough, the 23-year-old from Cardiff, is renowned for his epic rise into motor racing just four years after winning Nissan's 'gamer-to-racer' project.

In 2011, he won the GT Academy, a scheme run by Nissan and Sony that turns armchair gamers into professional racers.

Over the past few years Mardenborough has competed in sportscars and single-seaters.

Nissan recently confirmed Mardenborough would take part in a full season of the World Endurance Championship, which includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

A VLN statement read: 'The opening round of the VLN Endurance Championship at the Nurburgring was marred by an accident on Saturday which injured several spectators.

'One of the spectators died, despite the immediate actions of the rescue crew in the medical centre at the circuit. The other injured spectators have been taken to hospital for ongoing medical care.

'The race was stopped to give emergency crew quick access to the circuit, and wasn't restarted.

'The accident occurred in the Flugplatz part of the circuit, with a competitor leaving the circuit for a yet unspecified reason and finishing up behind the safety fencing.

'The VLN and the organisers are deeply saddened by the accident, and their thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims.'

Mardenborough emerged from the car seemingly unscathed, although has since been taken to a local hospital for routine checks following an initial examination at the circuit medical centre.

Expressing their thoughts on the incident, a statement from Nissan read: 'Today's events have been a tragedy.

'We are all deeply shocked and saddened by these events and our immediate thoughts go to the deceased, those injured and their families and friends.

Over the past few years Mardenborough, son of former professional footballer Steve, who played for Wolves, Coventry, Cardiff and Darlington, has competed in sportscars and single-seaters.

In mid-February, Nissan confirmed Mardenborough would take part in a full season of the World Endurance Championship, which includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

The Nissan GT-R NISMO GT3 car has a top speed of around 200mph and can go from 0-60mph in under three seconds.

The Nurburgring was also the scene of three-time Formula One world champion Niki Lauda's crash during the 1976 German Grand Prix when his Ferrari burst into flames after hitting a barricade.
