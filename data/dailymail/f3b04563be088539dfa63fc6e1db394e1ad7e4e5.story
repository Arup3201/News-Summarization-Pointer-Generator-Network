Charged: Dorothy Canfield, 84, allegedly tried to hire a hit man to kill the Houston-area prosecutor handling her case

An 84-year-old female inmate allegedly tried to hire a hit man to kill the Houston-area prosecutor handling her case and to maim his boss like the series of killings of other law enforcement officials elsewhere in Texas.

Dorothy Canfield allegedly sought to have Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon attacked and his assistant district attorney, Rob Freyer, slain.

Canfield allegedly wanted the attacks to appear similar to the recent unsolved killings of two other Texas prosecutors- Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse. McLelland and his wife were found dead in their homes on March 30, about two months after Hasse was fatally shot outside the local courthouse.

'Dorothy Canfield hoped to capitalize on the tragic murder of the Kaufman County district attorney, his wife and assistant district attorney Mark Hasse to disrupt the prosecution of her theft charge in the most violent way possible,' Ligon said.

Neither Mr Ligon nor Mr Freyer was injured in the alleged plot, which investigators said surfaced in early April.

Her target: Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon and his assistant district attorney were the two men that Canfield was trying to hire the hit man to injure and kill

The deaths of the Kaufman County 
prosecutors were among several recent high-profile law enforcement 
killings, including the shooting earlier this month of a southern West 
Virginia sheriff and the March slaying of Colorado's prison chief.

Canfield faces charges of solicitation of capital murder and solicitation to commit aggravated assault on a public servant.

Authorities allege Canfield told others of her plans to seek someone to kill Freyer and attack Ligon.

Canfield was being held Monday in jail in Conroe, about 30 miles north of Houston, on a property theft charge that involves allegations she posed as an immigration attorney, even though she is not a lawyer, in order to bilk clients.

Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow in late March and their slaying was reportedly the inspiration for the hit that Canfield tried to arrange

Target: Kaufman County assistant district attorney Mark Hasse was killed on January 31

At a news conference, Ligon played a 
recording of a meeting on April 8 in the county jail between Canfield 
and an undercover law enforcement agent who posed as a hit man.

In
the recording, Canfield urged that the killing and maiming be done as 
soon as possible, and for the alleged hit man to 'make it look good.'

Canfield sought to pay $5,000 for Freyer to be killed and $2,500 for the attack on Ligon, authorities said.

Authorities said Canfield admitted to trying to hire the hit man during an interview with two Texas Rangers on Monday.

Sergeant Wende Wakeman, one of the Texas Rangers who spoke with Canfield, said at the news conference the 84-year-old woman was 'very cold and not very remorseful.'

Ligon rejected any thoughts of sentiment because of her age.

'If you've got the motivation, the means to make it happen, it doesn't matter your age. It only matters what your intent is. The contract already was sealed,' he said.

'The fact of the matter is the person she was trying to hire was a very robust, young guy that was able to carry out her intentions. Don't get lost in the fact what her age is.'

suspect in the murder of Colorado prison's chief Tom Clements (right) 
and Clements murder was the first of a string of such cases in the area

On a tape of their conversation, she said she had $647,000 as proof she could pay.

'If somebody takes a step to actually meet with a hit man, we take that serious,' Ligon said.

She was originally in jail for bilking the clients while posing as an immigration lawyer, the charge for which included a bond set at $500,000. Court records show various theft and forgery cases having been filed against Canfield, some dating back to 1993.
