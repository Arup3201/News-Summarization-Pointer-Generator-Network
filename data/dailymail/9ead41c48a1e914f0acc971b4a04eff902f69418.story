Britain's largest card retailer, Clinton Cards is set to lose its fight for survival after its biggest supplier said it will force it into administration later today.

The retailer, which employs more than 8,000 staff, operates 628 Clintons and 139 Birthdays stores, and has requested that its shares be suspended on the London Stock Exchange.

The move comes after its banks - Barclays and taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland - sold the company’s £35 million of loans to its biggest supplier, American Greetings.

High Street woes: Clintons is the UK's biggest card retailer and employs more than 8,000 staff

But whereas the banks had waived loan repayments, American Greetings has said it will push the company into administration today.

The cards and gifts retailer expects to enter administration, becoming the latest casualty on the British high street after its biggest supplier American Greetings bought up loans from its banks and promptly called them in.          

Clinton Cards said in a statement announcing the suspension of trading in its shares that it had been in breach of some conditions attached to £35 million ($56.5 million) worth of loans and that it was not in a position to repay them.          

The group said it had been informed 
overnight that its banks Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, which had 
given it temporary waivers over the breaches, had sold the loans.       

Clinton Cards said 
that it had not been party to negotiations leading up to the deal but 
that it had anticipated American Greetings would extend the waivers 
granted by the banks and start talks with a view to supporting it.

'However, having secured control of the 
debt, American Greetings immediately informed the board that it intended
to enforce the loan against the company and the board has concluded 
that because it is unable to repay the loan it has no option but to 
concur with American Greetings proposal to place the company and its 
subsidiaries into administration,' the group said in Wednesday's 
statement.     

Gloomy predictions: The company announced in March that it had slumped to a first half loss and warned that its prospects for the second half were worse than originally anticipated

Clintons's announcement follows a turbulent period for Britain's high street.

Last month Mothercare axed 100 job when it closed 100 stores.

Another of the U.K's iconic stores Woolworth's, folded in 2008 under huge debt.

It was the first in a wave of closures that rocked the country's high streets.

News of Woolworth's demise came on the same day as furniture chain MFI said it would be closing its doors.

Store closures have become familiar news for the retail sector while a number of shops have announced plans to slim back their operations.

Chocolate retailer Thorntons recently announced it is to close 180 of 579 stores over the next three years.

The alcohol market has also been hit with off-licence group First Quench, which owns Threshers and Wine Rack, announcing it will close more than 750 stores in 2009 with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs.

Plus-sized womenswear chain Peacocks collapsed into administration in January, which will lead to 1,400 jobs across its stores.

  

The firm, which trades from about 628 Clinton Cards stores and 139 Birthdays outlets, had been due to publish the results of a strategic review into how it will cope with tough trading conditions and intense competition from supermarkets and the Internet.      

The company announced in March that it had slumped to a first half loss and warned that its prospects for the second half were worse than originally anticipated.               

Shares in Clinton Cards, which have lost more than 80 per cent of their value since the start of 2010, closed at 6.75 pence on Tuesday, valuing the group at about 14 million pounds ($22.6 million).         

Nobody at American Greetings could immediately be reached for comment.    

With British shoppers' disposable incomes squeezed by rising prices, muted wage growth and government austerity measures, store chains have faced tough conditions, pushing a string of retailers to the brink.

The chain was founded in 1968 when Don Lewin opened the first store in Epping in Essex.

His son Clinton Lewin, who he named the store after, is currently the brand's managing director.

In 1988 it had 77 stores when it 
floated on the stock market. Its store numbers were swelled by numerous 
acquisitions including Hallmark Cards and the Birthdays Group, which had
170 stores, in 2004.

The 
news come as figures revealed today the wettest April on record dampened
demand for summer fashion as retailers suffered their biggest sales 
falls for more than a year.

Like-for-like
sales dropped a 'disappointing' 3.3 per cent - the worst performance 
since March 2011 - driven by 'substantial' falls for clothes retailers 
and the worst footwear trading since January 2008, the British Retail 
Consortium (BRC) said.

Meanwhile Sainsbury’s hailed the success of its price-matching scheme today as it delivered a better than expected rise in annual profits.

The UK’s third largest supermarket, which has more than 1,000 stores, said underlying profits increased 7.1 per cent to £712 million in the year to March 17, beating City forecasts for a 5 per cent rise.

The group said overall sales excluding VAT rose 5.6 per cent to £22.3 billion, taking its market share to the highest level for nearly a decade at 16.6 per cent. It was helped by its Brand Match price scheme, which guarantees to match Asda and Tesco on 14,000 branded goods.

However, the chain, which opened 73 Local convenience stores last year as part of 1.4 million sq ft of new space, said it will slow its rate of store expansion from just over 7 per cent to about 5 per cent in the current financial year.

The group’s profits growth represents a slowdown on the 9% increase a year ago but is still much better than Tesco, which recently suffered its first fall in UK profits for 20 years, while Morrisons last week posted its first fall in like-for-like sales in seven years.

The supermarket price war has gathered intensity in recent months after Asda launched a guarantee to be 10% cheaper than rivals, while Tesco staged its £500 million Big Price Drop campaign.

But Sainsbury’s Brand Match scheme, launched in October, coupled with its Live Well For Less advertising campaign, has helped it out-perform the grocery market. Like-for-like sales excluding fuel but including VAT were up 2.1 per cent, helped by a strong final quarter.

Chief executive Justin King said: “We are succeeding by understanding what our customers want, supporting and inspiring them to Live Well For Less.

'Brand Match, combined with our use of coupons at the till, has improved Sainsbury’s price perception whilst retaining the benefits of our heritage in quality and service.'
