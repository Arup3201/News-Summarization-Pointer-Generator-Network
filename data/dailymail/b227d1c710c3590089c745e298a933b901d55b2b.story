British children are suffering thanks to an epidemic of online bullying - with the number of calls to ChildLine from victims almost doubling in just one year.

In 2012/13, a total of 4,507 children - around 12 a day - rang the helpline to complain they were being abused by peers on social networking sites.

That is up a startling 87 per cent from the 2,410 calls the year before, with the head of the NSPCC revealing many were ringing in ‘utter panic’ after suffering months of ‘torment’.

Girls are three times more likely to call than boys and, worryingly, one in six calls are received from children aged 11 or younger.

The revelation follows the death of 14-year-old Hannah Smith, who hanged herself on Friday after months of abuse on the internet.

Her father said he had found bullying posts on his daughter’s ask.fm page from people telling her to die.

She had been urged to ‘drink bleach’ by her anonymous tormentors and taunted over her weight, the death of an uncle and an apparent propensity to self-harm.

The notorious ask.fm website - described as a ‘stalker’s paradise’ - has been linked to at least four teenage deaths over the past year.

Now an analysis of calls received by ChildLine show that these victims are far from alone - and that cyberbullying is now one of the fastest growing issues young people contract them about.

The shocking increase has happened just as the number of calls about traditional playground bullying has started to fall - indicating that attackers are retreating to the virtual word as schools take a tougher approach.

NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ‘When I was young you could at least escape the bullying when you got home from school and closed the front door behind you.

‘But now it follows children into their homes, into their bedrooms via mobile phones and laptops.’

He added: ‘Many young people suffer in complete silence not knowing what to do or who to turn to. They internalise the pain blaming themselves going over and over it in their head.’

Victim: Hannah Smith, 14, has killed herself after being bullied by anonymous trolls online

ChildLine, the helpline founded by former That’s Life presenter Esther Rantzen, is now provided by the NSPCC.

Their analysis of calls revealed that in 2012/13, more than 1,000 boys rang advisers because they are being intimidated online.

And while cyberbulling mostly affects teenagers, the figures reveal that around 16 per cent of calls - more than 700 - are from children aged 11 or younger.

One girl told an adviser: ‘I feel really depressed and like I want to fade away. I have no one to talk to and no one understands what I’m going through.

‘This girl has been sending me really horrible messages on the internet, telling me I should kill myself and that I am fat and ugly.

'Everyone tells me to ignore it, but it really upsets me that someone would say such awful things. I don’t know what to do?’

Another said: ‘I’m not feeling good. Someone has set up a fake social network account and is pretending to be me.

I don’t know who it is, but I’m really upset because they have been sending horrible messages to people I know and now people are starting to hate me because they think it’s me doing it.

‘I’m really upset and don’t know what to do. I don’t want my parents to find out because I’m too embarrassed. I want to find out who is doing this to me.’

Mr Wanless said that the examples last week of older women suffering abuse from online trolls on twitter shows just how ‘horrible and draining’ bullying can be for the strongest of people.

He said: ‘For children and young people, desperate to be liked and to “fit in”, the consequences can be particularly devastating.

‘Can you ever imagine a situation in the office where people came up to you on a daily basis and called you fat, ugly or stupid? Can you imagine receiving emails from your work colleagues telling you they wish you were dead?

'No, and action would be rightly taken immediately. Others would step in just as others stepped in to defend the women facing abuse on twitter.’

He added: ‘Children and young people need to know that there is always somewhere they can turn.

'They can talk to their parents, their teachers and if they really feel they can’t speak face to face with a trusted adult, ChildLine is always here to listen and to support.

‘But these social networking sites will not go away; they must take more responsibility for what happens on their sites just as a school takes responsibility for what happens within its gates.

'We are writing to the regulators of these sites asking for an urgent meeting to discuss how we can tackle this problem.

‘But this is also about education. About being clear with bullies that their actions will not be tolerated and being clear to victims that they have done nothing wrong and it can and will be stopped if they speak out.’

A spokesman for the Department for Education said that no-one ‘should have to suffer the fear and victimisation of bullying’.

‘The law is clear that what is illegal off-line is also illegal on-line,’ he said. ‘Perpetrators of grossly offensive, obscene or menacing behaviour face stiff punishment.

‘Through the UK Council of Child Internet Safety we are working with social networking sites and internet providers to make the internet a safer place for a young people.’

The spokesman added that under the new curriculum, children would be taught from the age of five ‘how to stay safe online, and how to communicate safely and respectfully’.
