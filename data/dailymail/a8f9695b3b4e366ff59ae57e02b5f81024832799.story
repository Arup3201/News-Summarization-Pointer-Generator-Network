A wanted man has taunted police on Facebook and mocked their attempts to find him by bragging: 'I've always liked playing hide and seek.'

Lincolnshire Police launched an appeal to find Aaron Bee, 22, who is wanted in connection with an assault and an incident of domestic violence.

After failing to find the father-of-one at his home in Lincoln, officers turned to the public for help finding information on Wednesday.

Following a police appeal Bee took to his own social media account to mock the force's efforts to trace him

When police released a mug-shot and an appeal on Facebook, Bee took to his own social media account to mock the force's efforts to trace him.

He branded the pursuit as 'fun and games' and joked 'I always liked playing hide and see as a kid.'

Writing on his Facebook page yesterday he said: 'How come my photo is all over Facebook? Anybody would think iam (sic) wanted or something lmao.'

He went on to add: 'I'll play hide and seek till it gets boring then Fox and hounds.'

He later posted: 'I'm still hear (sic).'

Bee took to the social media website after police issued a wanted persons appeal in relation to allegations of assault on October 14 and domestic violence on October 10.

In a foul-mouthed rant he wrote: 'The justice system is really f****d up, the police go out there own way to put pics of people wanted for theft and a poxy assault, when There is dirty f*****g perverts out there, it's a JOKE'.

Bee also launched a foul-mouthed tirade against the police and judicial system calling the search a 'joke'

His friends even joined in, with one posting: 'u can't miss that face anywhere hahaha (sic)'

Another added: 'I don't understand why it is so hard to find you...you're hardly hiding.'

Bee also wrote on Lincolnshire Police's Facebook page, where they had posted the appeal to find him, simply writing 'Haha'.

Bee has mocked police who want to speak to him in relation to the two offences

Today Lincolnshire Police confirmed they were still looking for Bee but asked members of the public not to approach him if they spotted the fugitive.

A force spokesman said: 'We are aware of comments made by Mr Bee on social media.

'He is clearly upset that we wish to speak to him.

'His forthright manner will not divert us from our quest to arrest him.

'Should he wish to attend Lincoln Police Station to discuss the situation we will be very pleased to accommodate him.'

Bee's mug shot was released alongside that of John Parker, 28, who is wanted for theft and failing to surrender to custody.

The spokesman added: 'Numerous inquiries have been carried out and checks made to try and establish their whereabouts but have not been successful.

'Officers are now asking for assistance from the public in locating these people in order that the Criminal Justice Process can be completed.

'Police have released information concerning where they are believed to be located in order that they are brought to justice.'

Anyone with information is asked to call Lincolnshire Police on the non-emergency number 101, or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
