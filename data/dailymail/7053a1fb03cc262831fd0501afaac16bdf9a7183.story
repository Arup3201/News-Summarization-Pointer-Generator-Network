A convicted killer, who was jailed for murdering a 23-year-old student, has won a £10,000 prize for his first crime novel after judges were bowled over by the tale's realism.

The Private Eye Writers of America 
panel had no idea that Alaric Hunt was serving a life sentence for the killing of student, Joyce Austin, in Clemson, South Carolina in 1988.

Hunt's novel, entitled Cuts Through Bone they impressed them with its authenticity, and sparked interest from a publisher.

Unlikely star: the winner of the debut crime fiction competition turned out to be convicted murderer Alaric Hunt, pictured here in 2013, whose novel Cuts Through The Bone impressed with its authenicity

But when the interested party rang the 
Southern California number Hunt had submitted with his manuscript, they were told he unavailable as he was was in an institution.

Hunt's cousin, Jade Reed, who had posted his novel to the 
competition's organisers, had to reveal to Toni Kirkpatrick, an editor at Thomas Dunne Books, an imprint of St. Martin’s Press, that the author was holed-up in a maximum-security facility in the small town of Bishopville.

'Will he be out soon?' miss Kirkpatrick asked.

To which Ms Reed was forced to reply: 'Well, he's there indefinitely.'

Hunt, 44, has lived more than half his life behind bars. He last saw the outside world when he was 19. In 1988 he was convicted of killing a 23-year-old student, Joyce Austin, in Clemson, South Carolina.  

Ms Austin died of smoke inhalation from a fire started by Hunt's older brother, Jason. The brothers planned to disctract the emergency services while they robbed a jewellery shop nearby. Jason wanted to go to music school in Southern California and needed the money to do so.  

Six weeks later the police arrested Alaric and Jason for Joyce’s murder, and for robbery, conspiracy and several counts of arson. The spoils of their theft turned out to be women’s rings worth only US$200 in total.

The brothers were sentenced to life with no parole for at least 30 years.

Room with a view: prison is all Hunt has seen since his conviction when he was 19. He is currently in a maximum-security unit in Bishopville, South Carolina, thought to be this one

Hunt, who after finishing at 
secondary school was found to have an IQ of 137, is understood to have immersed himself in
 literature while inside.   

After landing a job in the prison library,  he has discovered authors 
such as Ernest Hemingway, the Greek and the Roman philosophers and the 
science fiction masters who wowed him as a boy and inspired him to write
 his own stories.

It was also in the prison library that he saw a competition advertised - the contest sponsored by Minotaur, an imprint of St Martin's Press.

The prize money caught his eye – a US$10,000 (£6,000) advance and a guaranteed publishing contract for the book – three years ago. 

He wrote
 Cuts Through Bone in nine months in sessions between his prison duties -
 five to write the first draft in longhand and another four months for a
 rewrite.  

The 320-page novel tells the story a military veteran wrongfully accused of his girlfriend's murder. 

Middle-aged
 detective Clayton Guthrie, teams up with Rachel Vasquez, the 
inquisitive teenage daughter of Puerto Rican immigrants, to investigate 
the crime.

The
 book is set in New York, which Hunt has never visited.

He said he 
pieced together knowledge of the city from watching episodes of the 
popular Manhattan-based detective drama, Law and Order, various novels 
set in New York, and a map of the city's boroughs dating for 1916.  

Unlike some other states, South Carolina has no law to prevent prisoners profiting from such work.

Hunt's publishers, Minotaur, stress that Cuts Through Bone book is not based on the author's own crime.

But Frances Austin, the mother of the Hunt brothers' victim, told The New York Times she was incredulous to learn he had written the book. 'He caused my daughter's death, and now he's writing a book about it,' she said. 'I can't believe this.'

The book has received mixed reviews. 'Sometimes, a crime novel grabs you on the first page with its plot. Sometimes, it's the writing. Rarely is it the author's background. But Alaric Hunt hits the trifecta in his debut,' wrote the critic for the Richmond Times–Dispatch in Virginia.

But the Publishers Weekly reviewer was less impressed. 'Overblown prose ('dawn broke, like an egg yolk bleeding yellow into a dark pan') doesn't help an unremarkable plot.'

Reflecting on his crime, Hunt told The New York Times: 'What haunts me is not seeing beyond what I wanted, and casually risking others. I killed Joyce Austin, and I killed my brother and myself. There's a hole there that can't ever fill up.' 

He hopes to earn parole when he is eligible to, but that day is still five years away. 'I'm afraid to choke on wistfulness,' he said. 'That has been the fate of many a prisoner. I pass them each day, still shuffling and muttering with their hands full of hope.'
