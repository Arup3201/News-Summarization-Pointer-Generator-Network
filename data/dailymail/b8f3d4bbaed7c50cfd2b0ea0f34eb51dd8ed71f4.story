Fantasy author George R.R. Martin, whose 'A Song of Ice and Fire' book series has been turned into the hit HBO program 'Game of Thrones,' has a new book being released this week, which includes what he says are faithful renderings of the landmarks and castles fans know and love.

Martin's book is 'The World of Ice & Fire: The Untold History of Westeros and the Game of Thrones,' and offers 300 pages of back story and original artwork by the some of the world's top fantasy illustrators.

He agreed to the companion volume in 2006 and expected it would take just a couple of years. Naturally, it took longer. He intended to write some brief text to accompany the drawings, but ended up setting down some 300,000 words, more than enough to make his editor's 'head explode.'

'It was bigger than I anticipated,' he said during a recent telephone interview, acknowledging that 'The World of Ice & Fire' might have delayed still further the next 'Ice and Fire' novel. 'I start these things that I think won't take much time and they grow and grow.'

Seat of power: George R.R. Martin recently said at a panel the Iron Throne 'towers over the room like a great beast'

Scaled down: The Iron Throne used in the HBO series is not nearly as large as what Martin has imagined 

Fantasy lands: Martin has said this illustration correctly shows Dragonstone, where the Targaryens once lived 

Rocky: Dragonstone is noticeably less elaborate in 'Game of Thrones' 

Martin said 'The World of Ice & Fire' offers material already in the 'Ice and Fire' series, material he has long worked out in his mind and on paper, but had never released, and material he invented entirely for the book, such as the section dedicated to lands on the other side of the Narrow Sea. 

(Fans of Tyrion Lannister, be advised: Martin includes little about the character he has called his favorite. He's saving that for future books).

Time spent working on 'The World of Ice & Fire' also means time spent on publicity, and on Sunday the resident of Santa Fe, New Mexico came to New York and appeared before hundreds of fans at Manhattan's 92nd Street Y. 

Dressed all in black - black corduroys, black shirt, and black vest set off by his white hair and beard - he was interviewed on stage by Salon.com critic Laura Miller and responded to written questions from the audience. A video of the interview was posted online. 

Martin was filmed saying at the panel that he had been inspired by Hadrian's Wall when imagining Castle Black at the Wall, where members of the Night's Watch defend Westeros from what lies beyond - including the White Walkers.

At the edge of the world: Martin has said he was inspired by Hadrian's Wall when imagining Castle Black at the Wall, where the Night's Watch guard the edge of Westeros 

As seen on TV: Kit Harington plays Jon Snow, one of the members of the Night's Watch on the HBO series 

Dramatic: The Red Keep at King's Landing is seen perched on the edge of steep cliffs 

Adapted: The Red Keep's design appears much taller and narrower on TV 

Not yet! 'A Song of Ice and Fire' author George R.R. Martin, seen in July 2014, has not yet released the next book, 'The Winds of Winter'

Speaking about the Iron Throne, Martin also said at the panel 'Nobody ever got it right. There were comic book versions, and there were versions in the card game and the board game, and there were versions on the cover [of books], and there were versions that were done for conventions. The very first.. there was a wooden one that I sat on in 1996.. but none of them were ever really right.'

'I said repeatedly the Iron Throne is huge,' he also said. 'It towers over the room like a great beast. And it's ugly; it's asymmetric. It's put together by blacksmiths not by craftsmen and experts in furniture manufacture. And you have to walk the iron steps, and when a king sits on it he's like 10 feet above everybody else in the hall so he's in this raised position looking down on everyone.'

Martin was also filmed saying the Dragonstone, the former fortress of the Targaryens, 'has been a b**** because it's really a unique castle. You know some of this is very easy for me as a writer to describe, but it's not necessarily easy for the artist to draw.'

Winter is coming: Large towers are seen on the top of the Stark stronghold Winterfell 

The North remembers: Winterfell is a much lower structure on the hit HBO fantasy program 

Martin, 66, has completed five of seven planned novels: The most recent, 'A Dance With Dragons,' came out in 2011, the same year the Emmy-winning HBO adaptation 'Game of Thrones' first aired. Martin said Sunday that one challenge is keeping track of so many characters and events spread out over thousands of pages. Like a filmmaker hiring a continuity director, he works with longtime 'Ice and Fire' experts Elio M. Garcia, Jr. and Linda Antonsson, who run the fan site http://www.westeros.org and are credited as co-authors of the new book.

'They displayed, right away, an almost obsessive knowledge of my world. In fact, I had to alter my world because of that obsessive knowledge,' Martin said in his phone interview, noting that they had caught errors in his work.

A native of Bayonne, New Jersey, Martin loved comic books and writing as a kid and by high school had won an award for a superhero story. He has been publishing books since the 1970s and began his 'Ice and Fire' series in the 1990s, intending to write a trilogy.

During his telephone interview with The Associated Press, Martin said some of his fondest early memories were of reading illustrated versions of 'Treasure Island' and other classics and that he wanted 'The World of Ice & Fire' to have a similar appeal. He admires the Kindle, but prefers reading on paper and thinks the new book is especially suited for its hardcover edition.

'My feeling was "Let's make it a coffee table book and let's fill it with some great fantasy art by some of the top illustrators in the fantasy world,"' he said. 'We're at a time in publishing history where you can have you stories in many different ways. But I'm still an old fart. I love a physical book.'
