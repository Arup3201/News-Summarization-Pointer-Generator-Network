Imagined: The book was released 100 years before Neil Armstrong landed on the moon

A rare copy of a Jules Verne science-fiction novel, which imagined man landing on the moon more than 100 years before Neil Armstrong set foot its surface, has been sold for £1,600.

De La Terre a la Lune (From Earth to the Moon) was written in 1865 and tells the story of an attempt to fire man to the moon using an enormous gun.

In the book, part of Verne's Voyages Extraordinaires (Extraordinary Journeys) series, three men are blasted into space from a launch site in Florida.

On their return from the mission they land back in the Pacific Ocean where they are rescued by the US Navy.

In recognition of the similarities between the story and the actual events of 1969, when Neil Armstrong became the first man on the moon, the book was signed by a host of NASA experts.

Among the 25 signatures is that of German engineer Wernher von Braun, the man behind the Saturn V rocket which launched Apollo XI into space.

Von Braun invented the V-2 rocket for the Nazis in the Second World War, 3,000 of which were launched on Allied targets including London.

In 1945, with German defeat inevitable, von Braun and his team surrendered to American forces and helped them develop rockets befoere turning his attentions to space flight.

In 1958 NASA was formed and von Braun was made the first director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in 1960.

Bill Anders, one of the first astronauts to orbit the moon on the Apollo VIII mission in 1968, and Tom Stafford, commander of Apollo V, also signed the book.

Similarities: The inside of the book's cover was signed by a number of astronauts and scientists, including Wernher von Braun, who was behind the Saturn 2 rocket

View: Included with the rare book is a photo taken from the Apollo spacecraft when it orbited the moon

The story was so ahead of its time that Michael Collins, commander of the Apollo 11 mission, mentioned it as his crew prepared to re-enter Earth's atmosphere in July 1969.

In a message to mission control at Houston, Collins said: 'A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the moon.

'His spaceship, Columbia, took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip to the moon.

'It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of the crew as the modern-day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet Earth and the same Pacific Ocean tomorrow.'

The story is based on three men be propelled into space using a giant gun

Rare: The copy of the novel was bought by a private European collector for £1,600 at a Bloomsbury sale

Collection: It is part of Verne's Voyages Extraordinaires (Extraordinary Journeys) series of novels

The book was snapped up by a private European collector for £1,600 at the Bloomsbury sale.

It was sold with a NASA-issued copy of Bill Anders' famous photograph of Earth taken while orbiting the moon on Apollo VIII in 1968.

'What makes this particular book unique is the signiatures from some of the top names from NASA including Wernher von Braun, regarded as the greatest rockest scientiest in history.'
