It's not often you hear of fears of a zombie invasion - and if you do, it's almost certainly on television.

But in the event of an apocalypse brought about by an army of the undead, civil servants would co-ordinate the military's efforts to 'return England to its pre-attack glory'.

The country's contingency plans for a zombie onslaught emerged in a response to an enquiry from a member of the public.

In the event of an apocalypse brought about by an army of the undead, the Pentagon has a plan in order to 'preserve the sanctity of human life' among all the 'non-zombie humans'

A Freedom of Information request has shown the surprising level of readiness for the eventuality.

The Ministry of Defence would not lead efforts to plan for such a horror attack or deal with the aftermath, reported by the Daily Telegraph, because that role would rest with the Cabinet Office, which co-ordinates emergency planning for the Government.

The MoD replied to the FoI request: 'In the event of an apocalyptic incident (e.g. zombies), any plans to rebuild and return England to its pre-attack glory would be led by the Cabinet Office, and thus any pre-planning activity would also take place there.

'The Ministry of Defence's role in any such event would be to provide military support to the civil authorities, not take the lead.

'Consequently the Ministry of Defence holds no information on this matter.'

It is not unusual for the Army to be called upon to save the day in zombie films. In 2004 comedy Shaun of the Dead, soldiers arrive just in time to save the film's hero.

Earlier this year, troops in the US were trained using a mock zombie invasion.

Hundreds of military, law enforcement and medical personnel observed the Hollywood-style production of a zombie attack as part of their emergency response training.

In the scenario, dubbed 'Zombie Apocalypse', a VIP was trapped in a village, surrounded by zombies when a bomb exploded.

The VIP was wounded and his team had to move through the town while dodging bullets and shooting at the invading zombies.

At one point, some of the team are hit by zombies and have to be taken to a field medical facility for decontamination and treatment.

Last year, an official from Bristol city council replied to a question asking what it would do in the event of a zombie rampage with a copy of a 'top secret' internal strategy document setting out its response.

Peter Holt, service director of communication and marketing, wrote: 'In response to your request for details of Bristol city council's contingency plans for dealing with zombies, I can now release to you the following strategy document.

'Please note that this document contains various redactions as it has been considered that some information contained therein must be redacted for the purpose of safeguarding national security.'

Marked top secret, the document set out four alert states, from ambient zombie level where business would proceed as usual to the highest level - zombie pandemic level - where infection levels would be over 30 per cent.

To avoid 'widespread panic', staff would be asked to listen for codewords on radio and television broadcasts to warn them that a zombie attack is under way.

Under 'health and safety' guidelines, the document urged staff to remember the correct zombie-killing procedure: 'Fully disconnect the brain-stem from the body through either blunt force or full head removal.'
