A police chase turned into a dramatic rescue operation when officers were forced to smash the windows of a car they were pursuing to free the four people inside after the vehicle burst into flames.

Adding to the danger, the fire which erupted at the side of a motorway north of Brisbane, then spread to the officers' marked van, which was also gutted.

Police began chasing the gang in a dog squad van after they failed to pull over on the Bruce Highway at Brighton about 8.30pm on Thursday.

A 4WD being pursued by police in Brisbane's north, burst into flames after it became stuck in a grassy field with an overheated engine

The flames soon spread to the police's dog squad van, which was also completely destroyed in the blaze

The four-wheel-drive ran off the Gateway Motorway and police moved in to arrest the car's passengers.

But before they could get them out of the vehicle the heat from the car's engine sparked a grass fire, engulfing it in flames.

The officers were forced to smash the 4WD's windows and pulled the three men and one woman to safety.

However the flames spread to the police van, which also caught alight.

TheÂ dog squad van was completely destroyed in the blaze however the sole dog in the van escaped without harm.

One woman and two men were arrested  at the scene after suffering only minor injuries

'The police did a tremendous job. They were placed in a very dangerous situation by the occupants of the vehicle,' Acting Senior Sergeant Allan Cook told the ABC.

'The occupants were wanted by police in regards to some serious offences that have been committed in recent weeks.'

Small fireball explosions were also seen during the car fires, believed to have come from munitions being blown up within the blaze, however police are still investigating the incident.

The woman and two men have been arrested while the third man remains at the Royal Brisbane Hospital in a stable condition and under police guard.
