Di
 Stefano, who was born Alfredo Stefano di Stefano Laulhe in Buenos Aires on July 4, 1926, was an integral part of the Real Madrid side that won five 
consecutive European Cups between 1956 and 1960 and he was voted 
European player of the year in both 1957 and 1959. 

He
 scored more than 300 goals across 11 seasons with the Madrid side and 
is the club’s second highest scorer behind Raul, with 307 goals in all 
competitions.

Di Stefano was the European Cup's top scorer with 49 goals in 58 matches before being overtaken by Raul. The Argentine is now sixth on the all-time list, having also been surpassed by Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Thierry Henry.

On the international scene, he represented Spain on 31 occasions and also played for Argentina and Colombia.

Cristiano Ronaldo tweeted: 'Don Alfredo leaves us, but his memory will last forever in our hearts. Legends never die. Thanks for everything Maestro. #EternoAlfredo'

Sir Alex Ferguson, in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports News, described di Stefano as ‘the greatest' and recalled seeing his ‘fantastic balance and poise’ as a teenager in the schoolboy enclosure at Hampden Park for the 1960 final.

'I was very sad to hear the news. Even at 88 it is a bit of a shock. I saw him two years ago before our Real Madrid game and he looked fine and looked full of health so it is disappointing to hear the news.

'He had a fantastic balance and poise. If you look at one of the goals he scored in the final against Eintracht Frankfurt it was completely what we are saying about the balance and poise, unbelievable he was.

‘The amazing thing about that game, being a Rangers fan, was that Eintracht Frankfurt had beaten Rangers in the semi-finals and they were looked on as Gods, but they came to Hampden and were annihilated by Real 7-3.

‘I was in the schoolboy enclosure, I was playing with Queen’s Park at the time, and it was a fantastic experience to see that game. It was the first time we had seen a lap of honour after a game.

‘In terms of European finals, to see 10 goals in one game, you won’t see that again. It was a golden period for Real Madrid with di Stefano, and for them to win it  five times and for di Stefano to have scored in all five finals was quite an amazing record.’

The two would cross paths 23 years later when Ferguson, then manager of Aberdeen, met a Real Madrid side managed by Di Stefano in the 1983 Cup Winners' Cup final.

Against the odds it was Ferguson's Scottish underdogs who won the trophy that night, with the Glaswegian impressed by Di Stefano's grace in defeat.

'My greatest memory of course is when Aberdeen beat Real Madrid,' he added.

'I was honoured to be in the same game as Real Madrid but to come up against Di Stefano was an incredible experience for me.

'When you mention the great players they had they were household names. Aberdeen were a team on the rise and after the game he was very generous and he said Aberdeen had a team that money can't buy, a soul and a family spirit.

'He couldn't say any more in praise of a football team and that was very generous of him. He had a fantastic life and I was really proud to have been associated with him in a small way.'

Jose Mourinho: 'It was with immense sadness I learned of the death of Alfredo Di Stefano, a wonderful man I had the fortune to know during my time in Madrid.

'Of course I first send my thoughts to his family and friends, but also this is a very sad day for football and football fans, which we all are, when we lose a special person like this.

'Alfredo was the best Real Madrid player in history - winning five consecutive European Cups - and one of the greatest of all time.

'Rest in peace Alfredo.'

Yohan Cruyff tweeted: 'I have always had a good friendship over the years with Alfredo Di Stefano. We have lost a good man and a great footballer. RIP, my friend.'

Sir Bobby Charlton told manutd.com : I was deeply saddened to hear the news of Alfredo Di Stefano's passing. As one of the stars of the legendary Real Madrid team, I think Alfredo was one of the best players I ever came across and an extremely intelligent footballer.

‘He was somebody I really respected, having watched him from the stands at the Bernabeu and then played against him. I have many fond memories of my time with Alfredo and feel privileged to be able to call him a good friend. The footballing world has lost a great player and a great man.

‘I'd like to send my condolences on behalf of everybody at Manchester United to his family and our friends at Real Madrid.’

Gary Lineker tweeted: ‘Alfredo Di Stefano has died. One of the greatest players ever. Scored in 5 successive European Cup finals. A feat never to be matched. #RIP’ 

David De Gea: ‘A sad day for the world of football. One of the greatest has passed away. RIP Don Alfredo di Stefano.’

Diego Simeone tweeted: ‘Don Alfredo has left us, one of the greats of world football. Farewell maestro.’

Manchester United tweeted: ‘We’re sad to hear @RealMadrid legend Alfredo Di Stefano has passed away. The thoughts of everybody at #mufc are with his family and the club.’ 

Barcelona tweeted: 'FC Barcelona expresses its condolences for the death of Alfredo Di Stefano, honorary president of Real Madrid. Rest in peace '

Iker Casillas tweeted: ‘RiP Don Alfredo, the greatest. A
Madrid legend, you will always be with you. The MAESTRO will always be
remembered.’

Sepp Blatter: 'Sad to learn of Di Stefano’s passing, the most complete player I’ve seen. My favourite player. A legend is gone. RIP'.

Juan Mata: RIP Alfredo di Stéfano. One of the greatest has passed away. My condolences to his family and friends.

Pele added: 'He was a trailblazer, and most of all, he was a legend of the game. God rest his soul.

'Today, the openness between Latin American players and European clubs is very much due to the work of Alfredo Di Stéfano.

'Back when we played, Santos and Real Madrid were for many years primary rivals, for having the best football teams in the world.'
