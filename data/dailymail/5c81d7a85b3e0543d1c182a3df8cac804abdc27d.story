A group of trainee first-aiders had to deal with a real-life emergency when a driver became trapped in his overturned car outside their classroom.

The nine security guards were attending a training course when the car flipped on to its roof in a crash opposite the building they were in on the A1500 in Lincolnshire.

They leapt into action after the blue Suzuki Swift collided with a yellow dumper truck on the busy stretch of road between Sturton-by-Stow and Scampton - leaving its driver, 44, trapped and injured.

Real-life: Nine trainee first-aiders were pressed into emergency action when their course was interrupted by a crash outside the training centre where they were being taught in Lincolnshire

One of the first on the scene of the crash was training manager Mike Johnson. The 59-year-old said the trainee first-aiders followed him into action to help the casualty during the emergency, which happened at about 4pm on Tuesday.

He said: 'We heard the collision outside and saw that the traffic had all come to a halt. So we put our action plan into operation, got our receptionist to call the emergency services and immediately got our trainees on the scene directing traffic.

'We did the best we could to help the casualty, who was trapped upside-down in his overturned car. But the trainees grabbed fluorescent jackets and did a splendid job stopping the traffic and turning it round as the road was blocked in both directions.

'The next person on the scene was a nurse, so we did what we could for the driver.'

First-aid trainee Glyn de Lacy, 62, said his colleagues were only too happy to help when the crash happened.

He said: 'We were on the course when the accident took place right outside the centre. It was the best lesson we all had, actually learning it for real. We directed the traffic away from the accident while another [person] called the emergency services.'

After being freed by firefighters, the driver, from Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, was taken to Lincoln County Hospital.

Lincolnshire Police spokesman Deborah Owen said: 'The car ended up on its roof and the driver received injuries which were not thought to be life-threatening.'

The road was blocked for nearly an hour until police completed their work at the scene.
