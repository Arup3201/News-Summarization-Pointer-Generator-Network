A mother who thought her newborn son simply had hiccups was horrified to be told he was having a stroke.

Archie Lyall was only a few hours old when he suffered a neonatal stroke which left him at risk of cerebral palsy and other debilitating conditions.

As he was lying in his hospital cot on Boxing Day 2012, his mother Helen Bunker him twitching, but mistakenly dismissed it as hiccups.

Danger: Archie Lyall, now 18 months (pictured with mother Helen), was only a few hours old when he suffered a neonatal stroke which left him at risk of cerebral palsy

But when midwives asked her how long Archie had been twitching, they became concerned - and a brain wave analysis confirmed he had suffered a stroke.

Ms Bunker said: 'It was a really scary time, especially with Archie being our first child.

'A couple of hours after he was born, the midwife came round and pointed at his chest and asked me how long he’d been doing the twitching.

'I’d thought it was just hiccups, so she told me to tell her if it happened again.

'But an hour later, my partner Lee noticed he was doing it again.'

Archie was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit at Hull and East Yorkshire Women’s and Children’s Hospital before Helen and Lee had even taken a photo.

Brave: Archie has since made a recovery and hit all his development milestones

Instead, one the nurses kindly took one for the devastated couple and brought it down to them.

Ms Bunker, from Hull, said: 'Archie had wires and tubes all over him and all sorts of machines attached to his body.

'He had monitors on his brain. When he twitched, he looked perfectly normal - like nothing much was happening - but on the machine, his brain waves were going ten to the dozen.

'He had an MRI scan and that’s when they told us he’d had a neonatal stroke.'

Once Archie was well enough to leave hospital, he was given medication and his parents were told to watch his development closely.

This is because not hitting any of the normal baby milestones - such as recognising faces and learning to crawl - could be a sign the stroke had had a lasting effect.

But 18 months on, Archie has finally made a full recovery, to his family's relief.

Fight: Archie in hospital. Doctors say newborns have a higher risk of as stroke as their blood is thicker

This week, consultants finally signed him off and said he would not need any more appointments.

His mother said: 'The doctor told us us he was completely fine and he was doing everything a normal baby should be.

'When she said that would be our last appointment, and there shouldn’t be any problems in future, we were so happy.

'It’s a day we’ve been looking forward to since we found out he’d had the stroke.

'It was such a relief. It felt like a big weight had been lifted off our shoulders.

'He's now doing all the things a little boy should and is really showing his cheeky personality.'

Stroke in the first 28 days of life is more common than parents realise. In fact newborns have as high a risk of stroke as the elderly, according to The Hospital for Sick Children, in Canada.

Newborns are at risk of a stroke for a number of reasons. Proteins passed through the placenta can increase the risk of clots - and therefore stroke.

If a clot travels to through the bloodstream to the brain, it can cause a stroke. 

Pressure on the arteries and veins in the head during childbirth can also lead to a clot forming.

Newborn babies also have thicker blood - another risk factor for a clot.

Symptoms of a neonatal stroke include:

Repetitive facial movements, including sucking, chewing, or eye movements

Rhythmic jerking movements involving the muscles of the face, tongue, arms, legs, or other regions

Quick, single jerks involving one arm or leg or the whole body

Unusual bicycling or pedaling movements

Pauses in breathing associated with slowing of the heart

This could have left him suffering from conditions such as cerebral palsy

But 18 months later he has been given the all-clear and is healthy
