Zookeepers have moved a step closer to saving the Tasmanian devil from extinction after four joeys were born in captivity.

The Tasmanian devil, the world's largest carnivorous marsupial, is on the verge of being wiped out by Devil Facial Tumour Disease, a form of contagious cancer which was only discovered in 1996.

The rapid decline in their population - up to 90 per cent in some wild areas - has seen a number of zoos launch conservation programs to save the species.

Taronga Western Plains is part of a national population insurance program designed to help save the Tasmanian Devil, which is experiencing a rapid decline in population from the Devil Facial Tumour Disease

Taronga Western Plains, in central New South Wales, is part of a national program designed to help save the species.

The killer disease, which is exclusive to Tasmanian devils, spreads from biting and the first symptoms are small lumps or legions around the mouth, which later develop into large tumours across the animal's body.

As the disease worsens, the animals lose the ability to eat and typically die within three to five months, primarily from starvation and the failure of bodily functions.

The animals are iconic both in Australia and overseas. It has been the mascot of numerous Australian sporting teams, as well as being the basis for the Looney Tunes cartoon character Taz. 

The Western Plains joeys, one male and three females, were born in March and are the offspring of their mother, Moretti. 

Zookeeper Denyell Woodhouse told Daily Mail Australia: 'Moretti is a very protective mother and we are really pleased with how she is caring for and nurturing her offspring.'

Zoo keeper Denyell Woodhouse (second from left) said: 'It is hoped that in the future these four joeys will play an important role in the breeding program once fully matured, continuing to create greater genetic diversity in the insurance population'

Ms Woodhouse says the joeys will stay in the care of their mother for 12 months, before gradually becoming independant

'The joeys will stay with their mother until approximately 12 months, before they will be weaned and become independent,' she said.

Ms Woodhouse said that every birth is important, as the animals will be used in the future to advance the breeding program.

'It is hoped that in the future these four joeys will play an important role in the breeding program once fully matured, continuing to create greater genetic diversity in the insurance population.'

The recent births brings the total number of Tasmanian devils born at Taronga Western Plains Zoo to 22 since the program was launched in 2008.
