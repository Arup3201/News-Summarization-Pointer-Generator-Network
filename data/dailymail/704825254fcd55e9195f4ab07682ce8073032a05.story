Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi could face a tax inquiry over items they gave to their former assistants, it has been suggested today.

The couple's accounts could be looked in to by HM Revenue and Customs to see if presents given to the Grillo sisters and other employees were declared as taxable benefits.

Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo could face a probe themselves into tax on gifts such as luxury handbags and holidays.

Investigation: Charles Saatchi and Nigella Lawson (pictured before their divorce) may be investigated by HMRC, reports suggest

The latest news comes days after Nigella made her first public appearance to promote television show The Taste.

Appearing in an interview on ABC News in America, the domestic goddess said she had 'binged on chocolate' following her 'mortifying court appearance'.

She added her New Year's resolution was to get back into shape and 'listen to loud disco music' while working out.

She said: ‘I’ve been incredibly lazy. So it’s back to the treadmill.

‘But with loud disco music and thinking about what I’ll eat for supper, it’s fine.’

The Taste was aired in America last night and will be on British screens this Tuesday.

Gifts: In a trial last year, Elisabetta Grillo, 32, (left) and her sister Francesca, 34, former employees of Saatchi and Nigella, claimed the domestic goddess let them spend thousands of pounds on gifts

Today, tax specialist Jason Collins explained in The Telegraph how if an employer gives their employee anything that is not strictly needed for their work  - such as luxury holidays and wedding receptions as it was implied in the Grillo's trial last year - it should be declared as a taxable benefit.

Gifts or presents should be declared as part of the employee's income and national insurance should also be paid at 13,8 per cent, he said.

He said: 'If an employer provides an employee with anything that is not specifically needed for their work, that is counted as a taxable benefits.

'So if an employer pays for an employee to go on holiday on their own, or pays for the cost of a wedding reception, as was mentioned in the trial, that should be declared as part of the employee’s income and national insurance contributions are payable by the employer at 13.8 per cent.

'Not only that, but the value of the gift must be converted into gross salary, so if someone is in the 40 per cent tax band and their employer pays for a wedding reception that costs £12,000, that would have to be declared as £20,000 of income for tax purposes.'

He said it was up to the employee to ensure they paid the correct income tax.

A spokesman for HMRC said: 'We don't discuss specific tax affairs but in general the rules say that when you benefit from something provided to you by your employer there may be a tax charge.

'National Insurance Contributions might also be due. Anyone in any doubt can use the guidance on our website to check the position.'

The Grillo sisters were paid by art tycoon Saatchi and had company credit cards for his art trading company Conarco.

In the trial held at Isleworth Crown Court, the pair said Nigella let them spend thousands on holidays, clothing and other gifts as 'thank yous'.

The art tycoon said he paid off the cards every month and did not check what the money was being spent on.

Both Mr Saatchi and Miss Lawson have been contacted for comment.
