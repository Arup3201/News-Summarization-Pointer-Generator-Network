The Diocese of Northampton said Father Joseph Williams appeared to have died from natural causes

A priest who was discovered dead in a supermarket car park is thought to have been in his vehicle for three days.

Father Joseph Williams, 42, who was a priest at St Martin de Porres church in Luton, Bedfordshire, was reported missing on December 27.

Police were called to Morrison's supermarket in Houghton Regis, Beds on Monday and found his body.

The Diocese of Northampton said he appeared to have died from natural causes.

The Right Reverend Peter Doyle told worshippers: 'Father Joseph Williams died suddenly while out shopping on Friday, 27th December.

'Although there has to be a post-mortem, it would seem that he died of natural causes.

'Please pray for the repose of Joe's soul, for his family and for his parish. May he rest in peace.'

A spokesman from Bedfordshire Police yesterday (Weds) confirmed they attended the car park after paramedics found him 'slumped' over his steering wheel.

He said: 'On Monday we were called to a Morrisons supermarket on High Street, Houghton Regis, where a man had been found slumped over the wheel of their car.

'The ambulance service arrived first as they received the initial call and they recorded the man's death.

'The case will now be referred to the coroner's office.'

A spokeswoman from Morrisons said today: 'We are helping the police with their inquiries but won't be making any further comment.'
