Rebecca Gilchrist did not initially believe the local council worker who called to tell her that her cat had been found 165kms from his home.

Rupert, her two-year-old ginger house cat, had gone missing from his west Melbourne home on February 18 after darting out the front door.

He is believed to have then taken a two hour train ride to Traralgon, where he was found three months later.

Rebecca Gilchrist was reunited with her ginger house cat Rupert on Monday, after he was found 165 kilometres from his West Melbourne home

After months of bombarding her neighbours and local community with missing posters, Ms Gilchrist was contacted by the Latrobe City Council who told her that her cat's microchip had traced them back to her.

'At first, me and my mum were thinking "no, it can’t be",' Ms Gilchrist told the MailOnline.

'But then we thought about it and there is just no way that they'd have a ginger cat with a similar enough microchip number to have accidently punched our number.'

Ms Gilchrist explained that the normally content cat, which spent most of his time in the house or lazing about in the sun with her Dalmatian Poppy, was not very fond of people.

Local councilors from Traralgon, where Rupert was found, believed that he most likely jumped on a slow moving paper mill train which links the two areas

Ms Gilchrist said her Dalmatian Poppy, was ecstatic to have her companion back and kept leading her owners to their local railway tracks while Rupert was missing

Rupert's family was at a loss as to how he managed to get so far from home.

The only hint they received was from Poppy their dog, who Ms Gilchrist said kept leading them towards some train tracks near her home.

'Everyone was quite surprised he'd gotten so far. One of the council workers said there was a train line at the end of the road and that’s probably the most likely way he’d gotten there,' she said.

'It's a slow moving paper mill train that goes once a day and stops at most of the stops on the way here.'

Rupert was picked up by the council last Tuesday after he was found wandering near the animal rescue centre.

Rupert was hand-reared by Ms Gilchrist after she found him dumped in a garbage bin as a kitten. Poppy played a big role in helping to raise the kitten, instantly taking him on as one of her own pups

Since being reunited with his owners, the ginger cat has had an enthusiastic welcoming back from Poppy who was ecstatic to be reunited with her companion.

'As soon as she smelt it was our cat we brought home, she was doing backflips and jumping in circles. she was so excited  and kept trying to clean him,' Ms Gilchrist said.
