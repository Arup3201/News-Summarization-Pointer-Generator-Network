A father of two young children who inspired millions of parents across the world with his blog posts about 'finding Heaven on Earth' has died from lung cancer at the age of 42, it has emerged.

Oren Miller, a stay-at-home father to Liam, six, and four-year-old Madeline, was diagnosed with terminal cancer last May after suffering from shortness of breath and severe pain in his back.

Tragically, he and his wife, Beth Blauer, from Owing Mills, Maryland, were told the disease had already spread to his liver, his lymph nodes and his brain. He was given only a year to live.

Mr Miller, whose 'A Father and a Blogger' site was hugely popular among parents, battled stage four cancer for nine months, before succumbing to it on Saturday, his family told the Baltimore Sun.

A funeral service was held for him at Sol Levinson & Bros. Funeral Home in Baltimore on Monday afternoon. His death has also inspired hundreds of online tributes from fans and other bloggers.

In one of his most prominent posts on his blog following his cancer diagnosis, Mr Miller told his thousands of readers: 'I believe in Heaven on Earth, and I believe it's found anywhere you seek it.'

He continued: 'I found Heaven on long car rides with the kids', adding that he used daily trips to school to 'chat' with his children about their worlds, music, life values and, of course, 'nonsense'.

And he said that he 'found Heaven on the dirty floor of a basketball court', where he would pass the ball back and forth with his then-two-year-old daughter as they waited for Liam to finish school.

In a separate post, he wrote: 'We all know I will be loved until my last moment by people it has been my utmost privilege to know: by a wife I adore and two kids I'm in awe of every single moment.'

In addition his inspirational blog, Mr Miller set up a Facebook page, 'Dad Bloggers', shortly after the birth of his son. The page currently has more than 1,500 members from over 15 countries.

Mr Miller's online presence was so great that when he was diagnosed with cancer nine months ago, his fellow bloggers, friends and other members of the public rushed to his and his family's support.

They raised more than $13,000 for his medical care in just 24 hours. As word of his condition spread, they ultimately raised more than $36,000 for the Miller family,TODAY Parents reported.

Mr Miller previously told the news site: 'I’ve always said that the group is not me, it’s whatever people put into it. But I’m equally as happy to see that people appreciate what I did, I guess.'

Incredibly, the fathers within the 'Dad Bloggers' community rallied again when they learned that Mr Miller and his wife were forced to miss a Billy Joel concert in New York's Madison Square Garden. 

They recorded themselves covering  Joel's songs from their kitchens, bathrooms and even garages, before posting a compilation to YouTube. Some played the piano, while others played the guitar.

Tribute: Dad 2.0 Summit paid tribute to Mr Miller on Facebook, calling him a 'forthright curator of online dads'

In the past few days, hundreds of people have been taking to Mr Miller's Facebook page and other sites to pay tribute to him. Using the hashtag #Dads4Oren, they have shared their memories of him.

In an online post, Australian blogger Dadinator wrote: 'Men don’t talk enough. It’s why we’re more likely to suffer mental illness. Why we die younger. Why we are more likely to take our own lives.

'Oren was a man who talked, who talked about the importance of talking and who shared himself and his journey as a father. But he was more than that, he built a community of men who talk.'

Another blogger, Brent Almond, wrote on his Designer Daddy site: 'One of Oren’s greatest passions was for the words of modern fathers - regardless of the size of their audience or the strength of their voice - to be heard in a Facebook group he has built, maintained and supported.'
