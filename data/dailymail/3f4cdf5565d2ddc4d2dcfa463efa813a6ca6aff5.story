For those who thought David Hasselhoff’s artificially intelligent car KITT only existed in TV land Ford is set to release a car that the Knight Rider character would be happy to cruise around in.

The new Falcon will be the first Australian-made vehicle that can automatically dial 000 if you crash - a particularly useful optional extra if you have an accident in a remote areas.

If the airbags are activated from the impact, the car will call emergency services provided the phone is linked with Bluetooth, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Ford has the 000 technology in a select number of imported cars for 12 months, but the system is expected to be fitted to all new Ford Falcon sedans and Territory SUVs from later this year.

If operator can't make voice contact with driver or passengers, emergency services can be sent to the crash scene using the GPS co-ordinates sent by the phone

If the 000 operator is unable to make voice contact with the driver or passengers, emergency services can be sent to the crash scene using the GPS co-ordinates sent by the phone.

The technology is part of a system that Ford calls SYNC 2 which also allows the driver to control the radio, air-conditioning and navigation systems by voice commands so their hands remain on the steering wheel.

The company even tailored the system to understand Australian accents following  problems with earlier versions.

The new  high tech car is part of the company's plan to put every possible bit of technology into the last Falcon model to broaden its customer reach and make it last through to the proposed deadline of October 2016 when the two Victorian Ford plants are due to close.
