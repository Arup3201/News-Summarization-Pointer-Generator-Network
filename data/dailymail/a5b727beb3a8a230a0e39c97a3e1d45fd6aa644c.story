France is today mobilising 10,000 members of its security forces to station around 'sensitive sites' after last week's terror attacks left 17 innocent people dead in Paris.

Interior Minister Bernard Cazaneuve said 5,000 people will be sent to protect the country's 717 Jewish schools, adding that troops would also be sent as reinforcements over the next two days.

Jean-Yves Le Drian, the Minister for Defence, confirmed the deployment will begin from tomorrow following a security briefing this morning.

French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the 'threat is still present' after last week's attacks left 17 people dead, plus three gunmen killed by police (pictured, police patrol Gare du Nord station in Paris)

The news comes as French authorities said they are hunting for another accomplice of Deli attacker Amedy Coulibaly, 32, who posted his suicide video online after he was shot dead

The French Prime Minister Manuel Valls insisted the extra security was necessary because 'the threat is still present' after last week's attacks.

Journalists, civilians and three police officers were killed after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi attacked the offices of magazine Charlie Hebdo, before accomplice Amedy Coulibaly shot a traffic officer and took hostages inside a Jewish supermarket.

Mr Valls told BFM television today that France is at war against 'terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam'. 

The news comes as David Cameron was briefed on the threat posed to Britain by security chiefs in Downing Street this morning.

A No 10 spokesman said that future counter-terror training exercises will include scenarios similar to the Paris attack.

Authorities say that Britain should seek to learn from what happened in the French capital.

Mr Cameron, who joined French president Francoise Hollande and more than a million marchers on the streets of Paris yesterday, emphasised the need for the police to be able to call on military assistance in the event of a major emergency.

He also stressed the importance of international co-operation to prevent the cross-border smuggling of firearms and other weapons.

Meanwhile French authorities said they were hunting another 'probable accomplice' to Amedy Coulibaly, 32, who shot a policewoman before leaving another four people dead inside a Jewish supermarket.

Police say they want to speak to whoever edited and posted a suicide video which appeared online after Coulibaly was shot dead by police. Detectives say the footage was edited after the attacks.

Colibaly's girlfriend, Hayat Boumedienne, is on the run after managing to evade French officers, cross Europe, and enter Turkey.

Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, told the state-run Anadolu news agency today that Hayat Boumedienne arrived in Turkey from Madrid on January 2, ahead of the attacks.

He added that she had stayed at a hotel in Istanbul before crossing into Syria on January 8.

It is believed Boumeddiene evaded capture in the Turkish capital because French intelligence services did not share details of her identity with their Turkish counterparts.

A source told MailOnline: 'She just slipped through the net. It is that simple. It should not have happened.

David Cameron, who attended a solidarity march in Paris yesterday, was also given a briefing today on the threat posed to the UK by terrorists in the wake of last week's attacks

'She should have been on the radar of French intelligence, and they should have told their contacts about her movements – but they failed to do that.

'If the security services had done their job properly, they would never have let her leave the country.

'But once she left France and arrived in Turkey, she had the opportunity to go anywhere. It is unbelievable she has got away so easily.'
