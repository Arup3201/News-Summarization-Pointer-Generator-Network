Liverpool have offered Mario Balotelli huge financial incentives in the hope they will help the controversial striker fulfil his potential at Anfield.

After Liverpool agreed a £16million fee with AC Milan and held a string of positive meetings with Mino Raiola, the player’s agent, Balotelli flew into Manchester on Friday night for his medical and to meet Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers face-to-face for the first time. 

Hundreds of Liverpool fans cheered him when he finally left the training ground, leaving him in no doubt he will be warmly welcomed at Anfield.If all goes well, the Italy striker will sign a three-year deal, worth £85,000-£90,000 per week. But there is also a bonus element worked to the contract that will see him rewarded if he reaches certain targets and does not step out of line.

The contract is also loaded with disciplinary measures that will be taken against the player if he transgresses. Should Balotelli stay out of trouble, Liverpool have the option to add a year to his contract.

Rodgers refused questions on Balotelli at his press conference but insisted that the hard-working environment he has built up during the past two years is strong enough to welcome any new individual into the fold.

‘Character is very important so no player would come in here if I felt it couldn’t work,’ Rodgers said. ‘It’s not just the coaching element. I always look at people as well — if I can help the person then it’s something I’ll look at.

‘People who know me well will tell you that I try to develop the player and the person. If I feel that someone cares enough, I will give them everything.

‘We have a culture that creates the talents and gives them the opportunity to blossom. Nothing will ever stand in the way of that. As long as they show they care, want to learn and develop, we can give them the opportunity.’

The Balotelli move represents a U-turn after Rodgers said emphatically on August 4 in Miami that the former Manchester City forward would not come to Liverpool.

But having been constantly frustrated when pursuing other targets — Loic Remy failed a medical, a move to take Radamel Falcao for a season would have cost more than £20m, while Samuel Eto’o is now being considered — Rodgers had another look at what Balotelli might offer.

The Northern Irishman has always admired Balotelli’s ability but once negotiations began — Liverpool initially enquired about taking him on loan — it became apparent there was significant value to be had from a forward with his ability.

Rodgers said: ‘Where I’m at with building the club, if we thought we were bringing in a player we felt was a risk... well, two years ago I couldn’t have done it as the environment wasn’t created.

‘What we have here now is a culture of people working very hard, an infrastructure that’s set up to flourish. If you come into that and you’re not that (type of) character it would be really difficult for you. 

‘This is a club that’s not like many others. This is a strong family club, with values and ethics that run over many years.

‘Sometimes you have to take a risk with people and a lot of the time if you take that risk you can get a reward for it.’

If there is a late hitch, Liverpool would turn to Eto’o and, as a precaution, they sent a medical team to Paris yesterday to run tests on the Cameroon striker.

As it stands, though, Balotelli is likely to be confirmed as a Liverpool player over the weekend. His squad number is yet to be decided but both 45 — the one he has favoured throughout his career — and 7, Liverpool’s most iconic shirt, are available.

If Rodgers is relishing the chance to work with Balotelli, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini was rather more cryptic about a player who helped City win the title in 2011-12.

‘I know the character of Mario Balotelli,’ said Pellegrini. ‘If Liverpool decide he is the player that is important for them, perfect for them and perfect for Mario.

‘It is not my duty to analyse what happened here when he was a Manchester City player.’
