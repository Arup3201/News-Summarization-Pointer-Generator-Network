A severe storm complete with flash floods, wild winds and mammoth hail stones pelting down across Sydney has left at least 17,000 homes and businesses in the west of the city with no power while a school teacher was struck down by lightning.

The lucky woman, in her 30s, survived the freak bolt of lightning with just minor injuries after crossing the road with an umbrella at St Justin's Catholic Primary School Oran Park, in southwest Sydney. 

In another freak accident  - a flash of lightning struck a house causing a mattress to catch fire in Glenmore Park in Western Sydney. But no one was injured after a fire crew promptly extinguished the fire. 

Fire and Rescue NSW have also attended flooding, electrical fires and fallen wires and trees throughout the city.

While State Emergency Services have responded to 70 calls with the majority being from Western Sydney.

Meanwhile, the crazy weather has caused chaos at Sydney Airport with either planes grounded, diverted or delayed with passengers advised to check with airlines on the latest updates with flights.

Sydney Airport tweeted that now the thunderstorm has cleared it was working with 'airlines to get back on schedule'.

Passengers choosing to take public transport to get to the airport were also advised to allow extra travel time 'due to lightning strikes affecting signal equipment' at Granville station earlier.  

A NSW Ambulance spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia a woman in her 30s had been treated for minor injuries from a lightning strike.

The spokeswoman said the woman had experienced tingling and did not have to be taken to hospital after they were called to Oran Drive in Oran Hills at 3.41pm. 

Further south in Victoria, a woman - in her 30s - has died after a tree branch fell on her while she was camping with a group of friends in Boorhaman - in the state's north.

Another woman, in her 40s, was also injured on Wednesday just after 1pm and taken to Wangaratta Hospital.

It is understood the area had experienced strong winds but it was still unclear to Victoria police what caused the branch to fall. 

These incidents from wild weather comes after the death of a 15-year-old boy who was struck by lightning on Saturday on a beach in New South Wales' Hunter Valley.

Jayden Morrissey, from Thornton, was holidaying with family friends at One Mile Beach when he walked out of the water after surfing and was electrocuted.

BoM forecaster Deryn Griffiths told Daily Mail Australia that the Penrith area experienced hailstones as large as a 10-cent piece.

She said there was a line of thunderstorms going down from Wollongong to Dubbo and the wild weather would not ease under late on Wednesday night or early Thursday morning.

'There are warm temperatures down closer to the earth and cool above from about about 5-10km above the earth,' Ms Griffiths said.

'So that creates instability and sufficient moisture. It's quite humid.' 

'More important to me at the moment is we'll be getting a southerly wind change which is due at midnight [Thursday] from the south.

'Once that comes through storms will clear up at that time.'

BoM reported Moss Vale had experienced winds of up to 106km/h at Moss Vale at 2pm while Dubbo recorded two-centimetre hail. 

Within an hour of storms hitting, State Emergency Services had received more than 70 calls for help from across the state, with most of them from the Penrith and Mt Druitt area.
