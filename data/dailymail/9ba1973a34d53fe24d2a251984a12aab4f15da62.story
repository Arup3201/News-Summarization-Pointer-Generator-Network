The Queen is famous for her love of Launer London handbags while the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge rarely ever carry bags at all.

One royal who has no such qualms about hand luggage is Spain's Queen Letizia who arrived to chair a charity meeting cheerfully toting a black leather number by one of her favourite brands, Hugo Boss.

The 42-year-old was chairing the annual committee meeting of the Spanish arm of UNICEF - an event that she has attended nearly every year since marrying King Felipe.

Serious though the business at hand was, Letizia's choice of ensemble proved a treat for fashion fans with the Spanish Queen combining a neat bouclé with a silk shirt and tailored trousers.

Rounding it off was a chic tote by Hugo Boss and one of her trademark pairs of spike-heeled court shoes.

Letizia, who attended the meeting with the Spanish Secretary of State for Welfare and Equality, Susana Camarero, is UNICEF Spain's honorary president and has long championed charitable causes.

As well as her work with UNICEF, the royal is president of the Royal Board on Disability, which works to make life easier for the physically and mentally handicapped in Spain, and is patron of a slew of culture and media charities.

The latter comes as no surprise given Letizia's own journalistic roots, with the 42-year-old enjoying a lengthy career in TV and newspapers before marrying Felipe in 2004.

After a stint at Asturian daily paper, La Nueva España, she went on to work for ABC, a popular national newspaper that enjoys the third largest circulation in Spain.

Next came a spell at Spanish news agency EFE before a move to Guadalajara in Mexico saw her take on a role on local paper, Siglo 21.

Back in Spain a year later, she worked for the Spanish version of Bloomberg, a news channel and agency specialising in economics, before moving to CNN+.

By the time she met her husband-to-be, Letizia was working for popular TV channel 24 Horas, where along with anchoring the popular Telediario 2 evening news bulletin, she reported on a wide range of breaking news events, among the 9/11 attacks.

Perhaps as a result of her reporting background, Letizia is one of the most enthusiastically pro-newspaper royals in Europe and regularly turns out for media awards ceremonies.

By contrast, Prince Philip is notoriously mistrustful of the media and once quipped to the matron of a Caribbean hospital he was visiting: 'You have mosquitoes. I have the Press!'

When asked by Guardian journalist Polly Toynbee whether he read the paper during a Buckingham Palace reception, an affronted Prince Philip allegedly replied: 'No fear!'

Others to complain about the Press include Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - all of whom have run into difficulty with the media.

Prince William, who last year threatened a pair of photographers with legal action after they were spotted taking photos of Prince George, is fiercely protective of his - and his wife's - privacy.

Although the British media has agreed to follow guidelines laid out in the Editor's Code, foreign newspapers have printed a slew of controversial images, among them one taken as a gust of wind blew the Duchess of Cambridge's skirt up in Australia.

Most notorious of all was an incident in which a French paparazzi photographer took photos of a sunbathing Duchess as she relaxed outside a secluded farmhouse from a road a mile away using a long lens.

The resulting pictures, which were then published by the French version of Closer magazine in September 2012, left Prince William furious and he later took legal action against the offending photographer for invasion of privacy.
