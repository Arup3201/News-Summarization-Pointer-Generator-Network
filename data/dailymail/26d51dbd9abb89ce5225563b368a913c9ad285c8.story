A retired greyhound saved the life of his owner and her four young sons after he woke them up when a fire broke out in their home in the middle of the night and their fire alarm failed to go off. 

Uno was rescued by Claire Whiteford last year and managed to save the family by barking in their faces to wake them up. He has now been given an award for his bravery. 

After the five-year-old dog woke them Ms Whiteford, 32 and her sons Kieran, 12, Paddy, 8 and three-year-old Aiden managed to get out of the house in Washington, near Newcastle, before the fire took hold.

The blaze had started after a freezer in the house spontaneously burst into flames. 

When fire crews arrive they told Ms Whiteford that Uno had saved their lives by coming to their rescue - despite never being trained in anything but racing. 

'Uno was barking in my face at 4am, he was running across the landing to the boys room,' said Ms Whiteford. 

'I thought he must have wanted to go outside but as I walked downstairs he continued to bark at me and that's when I saw that the freezer was on fire. 'I turned off the switches in the fuse box, called the fire brigade and we got out.' 

Uno joined the family last August and has quickly settled into their home. The fire took place on September 3. 

Ms Whiteford added: 'Greyhounds are not trained for anything but racing so they just

don't know danger - all he's known is racing.

'For him to come and get four people out of the house, I just don't have words for it.' 

Uno has become a part of the family since being taken in by Clare Whiteford, based near Newcastle 

Uno, a former racing dog, is not trained in how to rescue animals and has been given a trophy (right for bravery

Uno has been honoured with a trophy from Prince Bishop Veterinary Surgery, in Durham for his heroism. 

The mother-of-three added: 'I've just no words to describe how I feel. He is our hero.

'It was love at first sight when I first saw him I knew I had to have him. If I was to say to people get a rescue dog I would just say consider a greyhound now, without a shadow of a doubt.

'We're devoted to him.'
