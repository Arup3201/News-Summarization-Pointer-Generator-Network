A home robbery in Washington state was unraveled on Wednesday when a 4-year-old girl living inside gave her eyewitness account to authorities - who later determined that the girl's babysitter was in on the burglary. 

The babysitter,17, said two black men, armed with a knife and a gun, got inside the home on June 18 while she took care of two children, the Whatcom County Sheriff's Office said in a press release. In a 911 call, she said she and the children were able to escape.

Authorities descended upon the home and found it empty, the sheriff's office said. A Special Response Team and a helicopter were on-hand for support.

The babysitter told police that the home's neighbor, 25-year-old Cody Oakes, fit the suspects' description, the Bellingham Herald reported.

Oakes, the paper said, was led out of his home as a sniper watched nearby and handcuffed before authorities soon realized he was not one of the men they sought.

4-year-old Abby said the robbers were actually white, KCPQ reported.

'It wasn't the right skin color,' she told the station.

List of demands: The babysitter reportedly had a list of items she wanted from the home, the sheriff's office said

'They told us to get out of the house cause they wanted to steal stuff,' she also said.

Abby told KCPQ the robbers stole her kitty bank and iPod, as well as gaming consoles.

The babysitter later admitted to police she was in on the robbery, and worked with her 16-year-old boyfriend and another man, 18-year-old Ruben J. Benjamin, the Whatcom County Sheriff's Office said. She also 'had contributed a list of items that she wanted from the home.' Both men were found at a local motel and admitted to the burglary.

'It’s kind of sad because I don’t think she realizes the dangerous situation she put me in,' Oakes told KCPQ of the incident.

'I thinked about - that was really - that was really her being bad. She's not a good babysitter,' Abby told KCPQ.

However, Abby noted 'They got it all back because of me being the superhero.'
