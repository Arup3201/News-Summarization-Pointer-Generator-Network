Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp delivers his verdict on a weekend of shocks in the Premier League.

First, Liverpool were humbled at Upton Park, losing 3-1 to West Ham to make it three defeats in five this season.

And on Sunday, Manchester United were soundly beaten by Leicester City 5-3 giving Louis van Gaal much to ponder. There was also the small matter of a Frank Lampard goal against Chelsea for Manchester City in a 1-1 draw. 

How Van Gaal has to prove his genius

It doesn’t take a great tactical mind to go out and sign Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria. Any United fan could have done that. It’s not rocket science. But fixing the United defence is another matter. Now we really will find out if Louis van Gaal is a genius.

Everyone could see that United were light years away from where they should be. They were so obviously short of top defenders and have given themselves a major problem by not signing a recognised centre back.

They had no Champions League in the week and plenty of time to work on their defensive system. There were no excuses and to concede five goals against a newly promoted club is appalling. 

Now we will really find out if Louis van Gaal is a genius... the Manchester United boss must work on his system

Van Gaal is well stocked up front but he seriously needs to address the issues in defence

United were defeated 5-3 by Leicester on Saturday at the King Power Stadium

At the beginning of the season, people criticised them for using a back three but even with four they let in five goals. Can you imagine if that had happened with a three? It just goes to show there is more to their problems than just systems.

But for all of United’s woes, all credit to Leicester. They were magnificent again and have tested some of the best teams. Their fans will be loving the start they have made back in the Premier League.

Leicester were magnificent, they have tested the best teams in the league and the fans should be proud

Goal would have left Frank buzzing

Don't be fooled by the non-celebration. Frank Lampard will have been the happiest man in the dressing room after scoring that goal.

He is the ultimate goalscoring machine and if he didn’t want to score, what was he doing in the box?

He has perfected the art of arriving late in the area and makes it look so easy. He’s like a magnet to the ball but that’s not down to luck — he has spent a lifetime practising.

Don't be fooled by Frank Lampard's celebration, he would have been the happiest player on the pitch!

Lampard claps the Chelsea support, but If he didn't want to score, why was he in the box? 

Andre Schurrle got the blame for not tracking James Milner but Branislav Ivanovic should have known better than to let Frank get in behind him.

Lampard is the greatest goalscoring midfielder we have ever seen in the Premier League and maybe even the best in the world.

He will not have cared one bit about scoring against his old club. He is a true professional and the ultimate winner.

Set-piece shocker

Liverpool let in two Premier League goals in the first 10 minutes for the first time since February 1994, when Southampton beat them 4-2.

BELOW: Record since the start of last season 

Without Luis Suarez, Liverpool were never going to score as many goals. The worrying thing for Brendan Rodgers is his side are still letting them in at an alarming rate.

They’ve let in 35 league goals and kept six clean sheets in 2014. That’s not good enough.

Opposition teams are sensing the fear and set-pieces in particular are now a phobia for Rodgers’ men.

That is something you would expect to be fixed on the training ground, but you can overdo it. If you focus too much on weaknesses you can become very conscious of them and start to think more about what you can’t do than what you can.

The Liverpool defence look gripped by fear at every corner and free-kick. Since the start of last season they have let in more goals from set-pieces than City or Chelsea. They must improve.

Liverpool have conceded 16 goals from set-pieces since the start of last season

Brendan Rodgers' side have actually looked worse in defence since Luis Suarez's departure

City's new beast

Manchester City already have one beast in central defence with Vincent Kompany. Now with Eliaquim Mangala, they’ve found another one.

He was magnificent on debut and there’s no bigger test at present than facing Diego Costa. But Mangala was strong, aggressive and fantastic on the ball.

Between him and Kompany, City could have a formidable partnership.

Manchester City have another new beast on their hands other than Vincent Kompany: Eliaquim Mangala

This grappling is holding us back

Football has become so obsessed with trying to stop diving — correctly, I might add — that we have ignored another disease in our game: grappling at set-pieces.

It has been brushed over for years but it’s just as big a problem as diving. Every week we see players holding on to the opposition for dear life at corners and free-kicks. We seem to be losing the art of defending properly and fairly.

If it’s outside the area, it’s a free-kick. If it’s in the box, it’s a penalty. Simple. Until referees are strong enough to act, it will not go away.

It’s killing our game but if more penalties were awarded, then players would think twice before doing it again.

Big Sam sticks to the brief

When West Ham kept Sam Allardyce, he knew he had to produce attacking football if he wanted to stay in the job. Now he’s doing that in abundance.

West Ham have better players this season and have pace throughout the team. If they keep it up they will lose the fear factor they had last season of playing at home.

Sam Allardyce's attacking football with West Ham could mean the fans actually end up liking him

They deserved their win and it was a tactical masterstroke to play Stewart Downing at the tip of the diamond. He was magnificent all evening.

If Sam’s not careful, the West Ham fans might end up liking him.

Dele delight 

What a performance from Dele Alli. The lad is just 18 but he grabbed a hat-trick as MK Dons thrashed Crewe 6-1.

It takes a good player to score three goals from midfield, whatever level you are playing at, and Alli looks the real deal. He was fantastic when his side demolished Manchester United in the League Cup and was at it again on Saturday. 

Sometimes a young player is better off playing regularly at a lower level. Going through the youth teams at a top club is great but there are so few opportunities for first-team football.

I was 16 when I played for Bournemouth before Kenny Dalglish signed me for Liverpool and that early experience helped. It’s good to see Alli starting his career in a similar way.

Dele Alli was superb again for MK Dons on Saturday, the young midfielder has a bright future

Bruce's bonus

Mohamed Diame is proving to be a good bit of business for Hull.

He scored on his debut against his old club West Ham a week ago and hit an absolute screamer against Newcastle.

Steve Bruce has made some good signings during his time at the club and his new midfielder is big, strong and powers his way through games. He’s shown he’s got great technique, too, and at £3.5million he looks a snip.

Mohamed Diame could be a bargain for Steve Bruce and Hull at just £3.5m, he scored a screamer on Saturday

JAMIE'S PREMIER LEAGUE NUMBER CRUNCHING 

3 Peter Crouch must enjoy proving a point against his old clubs. The striker scored one and set up another against QPR, where he played for a season in 2000-01. 

That means that the last three times he has scored a goal and assisted another in the same game have all come against former clubs. QPR were the latest victims and he has done it twice against Aston Villa.

814 Arsenal completed more passes against Aston Villa than in any PL game since 2012, when they made 828 against Wolves.

2010 Spurs have failed to score in straight home games for the first time since August 2010. Not what fans hoped Mauricio Pochettino would add to the team. 

100% Crystal Palace clearly took their shooting boots with them when they went to Goodison Park. Neil Warnock’s team only had three shots on target in the entire match but scored with each one.

10 West Brom beat Spurs for the first time in 10 league matches. They also ended a run of nine league games without a win at White Hart Lane, their last coming in 1984. 

The last three times Peter Crouch has scored  assisted in the same game have all come against former clubs

2009 Burnley's poor form in front of goal means they are the first side to draw three Premier League games in a row 0-0 since Blackburn drew three blanks in December 2009.

16,171 Portsmouth in League Two drew more than 16,000 fans to Fratton Park for their 1-1 draw with Wycombe. That’s eight more people than watched QPR draw 2-2 with Stoke at Loftus Road in the Premier League.
