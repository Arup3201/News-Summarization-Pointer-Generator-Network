Jihadi John's 19-year-old sister, whom MailOnline has decided not to identify, produced a short film about a hooded serial killer for her coursework

Jihadi John's younger sister produced a short film about a hooded serial killer chasing a schoolgirl as part of her A-level coursework, it has emerged.

The 19-year-old is now a media student at Middlesex University while the pair's brother, now 21, is a small-time criminal with hardline and outspoken Islamist views.

The masked Islamic State executioner, known as Jihadi John, was yesterday named as Mohammed Emwazi, a Westminster University graduate from West London.

His 19-year-old sister, like Emwazi, went to Quintin Kynaston school where she was a prefect and studied cinematography at A-Level.

Her film called 'The Killer's Footsteps', which depicted a dead schoolgirl, bloodied footsteps and a hooded maniac brandishing a knife, was made as part of her school coursework and contained themes about bullying.

The 19-year-old, whom MailOnline has decided not to identify, described the film as representing 'a dangerous, shocking criminal who is a serial killer.'

But she said the film teaches the audience that 'revenge is never the right answer.'

In her description of the short film, she said: 'We showed and represented this killer by hiding this person under a hoodies, in dark or very dim light to create a mysterious atmosphere throughout the film. 

'By doing this we are able to play with the audiences mid a bit, and show them that the fact this killer can be anyone...But who?

'This killer can be a friend, family member, teacher, or in fact someone they have never meet before. However, the killer knows the protagonist and has been watching the protagonist.'

'The representation gives out a hidden message about how bullying is wrong, how we humans shouldn't stereotype people and pick on them because for what background they come from or the colour of their skin nor what they believe in.'

Emwazi’s brother, whom the Mail had decided not to name, is a member of the Woolwich Dawah group, which was also attended by the men convicted of Lee Rigby's killing. 

The university graduate, who like his sibling has taken a keen interest in computer networks, listens to the teachings of radical preacher Khalid Yasin, according to reports.

Several of his friends use images similar to those used by extremists online and last night at least one of his 68 friends on Facebook was displaying the black flag of Islamic State.

He has also commented on videos, supporting one in which a woman is mocked for praying in a clumsy manner.

Her film, a 'thriller' depicting a hooded man chasing a girl through a school, was made as part of her coursework

He has at least two convictions, for handling a stolen police bicycle and a string of thefts at a shopping village - and has twice been hauled back for repeated breaches of community orders. 

In 1996 the family moved to a three-bedroomed first floor flat in Warwick Crescent. 

From there they moved to a run-down terrace in nearby Desborough Close, surrounded by council blocks. 

Emwazi lived with his family at this small house for four years until 2002, the year his youngest sibling was born.

While Mohammed was at school his family moved again, this time to a flat near Lord’s cricket ground, where they remained until 2005.
