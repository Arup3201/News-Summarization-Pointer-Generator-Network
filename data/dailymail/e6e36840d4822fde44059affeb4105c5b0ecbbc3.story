These gravity-defying lowriders can bounce eight feet in the air with just a flick of a switch.

Alex Tuason, 25, builds amazing hydraulic cars at his father's shop, Hoppo's Custom Suspension Works, in Ontario, California.

To make the lowriders bounce, he removes the coil springs from the cars and replaces them with hydraulic cylinders.

The car shop in Ontario, California is creating custom lowrider cars that defy gravity

With just a flick of a switch, 3,000lb of metal bounces up and down - up to eight feet in the air

The hydraulics system is switch-operated and controlled with a remote or dial on the dashboard.

Alex grew up helping out at his father's shop but started working on cars full-time eight years ago.

Alex said: 'I've been doing this since I was in diapers - I grew up in the shop and just started grabbing tools.

'My dad's been a big influence in my life and taught me everything about cars.

'Eventually he will hand the business down to me.'

It costs customers up to $200,000 (approximately £105,000) to build their dream lowrider 

The lowrider car scene emerged in the 1950's in Southern California.

'The lowrider community is a small group of family - everyone knows everyone whether you're from Canada or Alaska.'

It costs customers up to $200,000 (approximately £105,000) to build their dream lowrider.

Alex said: 'It always starts off with the wheels, paint, upholstery, the undercarriage, hydraulic set up and then from there you start to detail everything.'

Eventually the car business will be passed down to Alex Tuason from his father

Although California is a hub for unique car cultures, Alex's builds turn heads wherever he goes.

Alex said: 'It never gets old for people - they see you and give you a thumbs up every once in a while.

'It's pretty cool to get that reaction from people when you're putting so much money into a car.'
