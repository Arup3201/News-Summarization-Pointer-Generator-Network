Argentina's support at this summer's World Cup has been impossible to miss due to their vocal efforts but some of the support - namely the players' wives and girlfriends - have been turning heads for other reasons.

The Argentines were cheered on in their Group F clash against Iran in Belo Horizonte by a host of stunning players partners, and it seemed to do the trick with Lionel Messi grabbing a late winner to secure progress to the knockout stages.

And Messi's girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo was in the stands at the Estadio Mineirao along with their 19-month-old son Thiago.

The 26-year-old sported an Argentina replica shirt complete with Messi's shirt number, 10, as she entered the ground, while Thiago was also kitted out to support his Dad with 'Papi, 10' on the back of his shirt.

But while Messi was the star of the show on the pitch, his supporting cast had their own supporters in tow as they left Belo Horizonte after the scrappy 1-0 win against the unfancied Iranians.

Martin Demichelis' wife Evangelina Anderson had been cheering on the now ponytail-less Manchester City centre back and his club teammate, Sergio Aguero, also had his significant other Karina Tejeda supporting him.

Sergio Ramos' wife Eliana Guercio was at the Tancredo Neves International Airport too with her two children.

The wives, girlfriends and family members were boarding a special charter flight back to Argentina after 1-0 win.
