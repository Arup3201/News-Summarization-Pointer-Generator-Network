British scientists have developed a forecast model that they claim will be able to predict extreme winter weather with up to 80 per cent accuracy.

If accurate, it could strongly influence the economy, with advanced warnings giving  airports, councils, insurers and hospitals more information with which to prepare.

The breakthrough comes after the Met Office was criticised for its ‘pitiful’ forecasts last winter – thought to be the worst predictions since Michael Fish’s infamous reassurance that there was no hurricane on the way in October 1987.

Last November, the Met Office told councils to expect ‘drier than usual’ conditions – only for the UK to suffer the wettest winter since records began.

Until now, even powerful super-computers have been able to perform only slightly better than chance when predicting long-term weather conditions.

But the latest model, which simulates the climate on a more detailed scale, was found to be 62 per cent accurate at broad predictions of weather conditions when it was tested on 20 years of retrospective data.

And scientists at the Met Office claim the reliability will improve, estimating that accuracy will increase to 80 per cent.

The breakthrough is due to stronger computing power, allowing scientists to take into account much smaller changes in the gulfstream and Arctic sea ice coverage, which impact on the British climate.

The Met Office’s Adam Scaife said: ‘This will have enormous benefits for the economy and society, and mean that planners can prepare well ahead for winter.’

Airports and councils would have a better idea how much grit would be needed, while power companies and wind farms would be able to anticipate energy demands, and hospitals could prepare for increases of accidents caused by the ice and snow.

And after the wettest winter on record, insurers would be able to estimate the potential risks of winter storms.

It is also a huge boon for the Met Office, which has been highly embarrassed in the past by its seasonal predictions.

In 2009, it forecast a ‘barbecue summer’, which proved to be a washout. And last November, a three-month forecast by the Met Office suggested only the East and South East might expect average rainfall.

The forecasters told councils there would be a ‘significant reduction in precipitation compared to average’ for most of the country. Instead, local authorities saw some of the most severe flooding in decades.

Professor Scaife said: ‘If used carefully there’s a good chance of winning, but no guarantee.

‘It’s not possible to predict the outcome every year but we’re doing it with increasing skill.’
