A British tourist has described her family’s ‘holiday from hell’ after all 20 of them were struck down with a serious illness at a ‘filthy’ Spanish resort.

Mother-of-two Jillian Hajrizi, from Rotherham, said her dream getaway at the three-star Azuline Hotel Mar Amantis in Ibiza last May was ruined when the entire family suffered severe sickness and diarrhoea.

They claim they were made ill by uncooked food at the resort’s buffet restaurant and have hired solicitors to pursue legal action against Thomas Cook and Jet2holidays. 

The family, including Jillian Hajrizi (second from right), her husband Labinot, her 11-year-old son Reece and her 27-year-old son Ryan, with his partner Jade (back row), fell ill during an all-inclusive break in Ibiza in May

Mrs Hajrizi, 47, went on the all-inclusive break to San Antonio with her husband, Labinot, a 27-year-old wages clerk, and her 11-year-old son Reece. They were joined by her other son, Ryan, 27, his girlfriend and her child, and several other extended family members.

Mrs Hajrizi, a full-time-carer for Reece, who has Sturge-Weber syndrome, a serious condition which means he suffers seizures, paid £1,200 for her family’s getaway.

She alleges she arrived to find a dirty room with stains on the bedding and ants running across the floor.

She said: 'I was still willing to give the holiday a chance. OK, I wasn't happy with the room but I still had hope that other parts of the hotel would be alright.

‘I realised it would not be the Ritz but it ended up being unbelievable.’

Jillian Hajrizi and her family claim they were sickened by uncooked food at the resort’s buffet restaurant

Jillian also snapped a pictures of her food after a family member reportedly found glass in the dish at the hotel

The next morning she claimed she cut into a sausage and saw it had not been cooked.

As the family ate from the buffet they continued to spot uncooked food, she said.

Jillian also claimed she saw a pool of urine on the floor in the corridor of the three-star hotel

Once the family members became sick Mrs Hajrizi said she had to be restricted to her hotel room with Reece for four days as he suffered badly with his symptoms.

She claims she complained to the manager but was shrugged off and told to fill out a form.

The family say they spotted a filthy swimming pool with algae in it and urine on the floor that was covered by staff with just a towel.

They also claim that on one occasion a family member found a shard of glass in an omelette prepared by the restaurant chef.

Mrs Hajrizi said: ‘This was supposed to be a nice family holiday but it turned into the holiday from hell.’

She and 16 other family members have instructed solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to investigate their claims.

A spokesperson for Thomas Cook said: ‘Thomas Cook takes health and hygiene issues very seriously and maintaining the safety of our customers is our number one priority.

‘Thomas Cook operates both a quality assurance programme and routinely undertakes independent third party audits to ensure that the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.

‘However, we are aware that the party have approached a no-win, no-fee lawyer to act as their legal representative. While our investigation into the illness continues, we are unable to provide further comment so as not to unduly influence any potential legal proceedings.’

A Jet2holidays spokesperson said: ‘We are sorry to hear about the Hajrizi family's holiday experience and, whilst they were not customers of Jet2holidays, we are investigating the reported incidents.’

Jatinder Paul, an international personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which is representing the family, said: ‘We are very concerned to hear of the conditions this family have reported experiencing at the Azuline Mar Amantis resort.

‘It is shocking that 20 members of the same family have all suffered serious gastric symptoms, some of whom are children who can be more susceptible to long-term health problems as a result.

‘In particular, Jillian's 11-year-old son suffers from epilepsy and as a result of the severe vomiting and diarrhoea that he suffered. He experienced seizures and required significant care from Jillian.’
