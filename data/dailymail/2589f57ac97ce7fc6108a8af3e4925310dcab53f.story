Not much leaves brash Hotel Inspector presenter Alex Polezzi speechless. But in the first episode of her new series, the frizzy haired hotelier gets more than she bargained.

As part of her crusade to make over the nation’s hotels, perfectionist Alex’s first stop is suburban Birmingham where she is set to help ex farmer Tim Higgs discover why his elite nudist resort is less than swinging.

56-year-old Tim hoped to turn his love of being naked in to a business and sunk his life savings – over £1million - in to developing the detached seven-bedroom house in to Clover Spa, a fully nude hotel.

Blushes: Undressing to impress at the retreat

Tim says: ‘For me naturism is a natural thing. To feel the sun on your skin and the breeze on your body is a lovely feeling.'

But 15 months on bookings are at an all-time low, and Alex thinks she knows why.

All are welcome as long as they abide by the fully naked rules at all times and unusually for a nudist resort Tim’s 'let it all hang out' policy is strictly enforced in all areas, including the kitchen, dining room and spa.

Steamy: Alex enjoys the facilities at the Clover Spa

Giggles: A guest relaxes in the communal areas while Alex enjoys the view

Arriving at the hotel a nervous looking Alex asks “Do I have to get undressed straight away?’

She
resists for a while, content to just enjoy the view, but soon the game 
hotelier attempts to join in by going for an au naturel dip in the 
Jacuzzi and enjoying some of the hotel’s spa services.

But – of course - Tim and Alex soon clash with her insisting that Tim’s strict and uncompromising no-clothes dress code is putting off more people than it attracts.

Hopeful: Tim scrubs the spa ready for new guests

Aside from the nakedness Alex is also less than impressed with the catering (ready prepared microwaved meals to avoid injury) garden and the décor of the £80 rooms, labelling the hotel ‘sterile’ and ‘anodyne’.

As well as offering style and menu advice the expert wants guests to be able to wear clothes at most times with some naked-only areas.

A hot tub showdown later and Tim's stubborn streak is eventually worn down, leading to a raft of happy new clothes-free groups falling in love with Clover.

'Alex has relit the fire and focused my attention on what's really important.

'Roll on the summer.' says Tim.
