From their first public appearance together, when she walked out of the hospital cradling her newborn son, we've barely seen the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George separated.

But today, for the first time, baby George was pictured not in the arms of doting mother Kate but in those of his new nanny, 43-year-old Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo - and he looked less than impressed.

The 8-month-old prince pulled an adorably grumpy face as Maria Teresa carried him to the car upon the family's arrival in Sydney today.

Where's my mummy?! Prince George looks a little grumpy as he is carried to a waiting car by his new nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo at Sydney Airport

The family chatted with waiting fans, including Joscelyn Sweeney, 22, who gave a bouquet to Kate and a book, Snugglepot and Cuddlepie My First Book, to George.

Sweeney, from Vincentia, NSW, who suffers from Down's Syndrome, was given the honour of meeting the royal trio after her mother wrote to the palace, describing her 'admiration and affection' for family.

After his meet and greet, a weary and slightly grumpy looking George, who was dressed in a smart and summery white 
ensemble, was taken to the car by his nanny - perhaps he was feeling tired after the flight from 
Auckland.

His parents 
then headed off to the Opera House, where they met excited well-wishers,
 before the family reunited and met the Governor-General Sir Peter 
Cosgrove at Admiralty House, where George looked delighted to be 
presented with a giant stuffed toy wombat.

Kate and William travelled by boat, while little George took the car with Miss Borrallo.

Feeling sleepy? Miss Borrallo, who began work with the family a month ago, is responsible for keeping the eight-month-old charge fed, watered, rested and happy

Well prepared: The Spaniard's training at the prestigious Norland College, where fees cost nearly £13,000 per year, will have prepared her well for the job

On his first day of the Royal Tour, Prince George was given a kangaroo backpack as a welcome present.

And it appears the gift is a hit: today his nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo was seen carrying the rucksack just after the royal trio touched down in Sydney.

The Australian Koala Foundation is one of the stockists of the bag that retails at $14.95 and sold out of its remaining stock the day it was given to the young prince.

CEO Deborah Tabart said there had been an huge rush on the cute kangaroo bag.

'We sold the last ones that morning - we've had to take them off the website but we'll be ordering more.'

With the bag stocked at numerous outlets, Ms Tabart said there was no way of knowing who gave it to the prince.

She offered Prince William an invitation to become the patron of the 28-year old Australia Koala Foundation.

The CEO also offered to extend the invitation to young George. 'He could be the patron in waiting.'

This isn't the first time that the Cambridge's new nanny has been in sole charge of the baby boy.

She looked after Prince George last Sunday 
when Kate and William went to Dunedin, and she will be in charge of the baby again on April 22 when they
visit Uluru, or Ayer's Rock.

Miss
Borrallo, from Palencia, 140 miles north of Madrid, was first spotted descending the steps of the plane
onto the runway at Auckland last week, along with three long-standing assistants
to the royal couple: David Manning, Miguel Head and Rebecca Deacon.

But the Spaniard's training at the 
prestigious Norland College, where fees cost nearly £13,000 per year, 
will have prepared her well for the job.

The
 internationally-renowned nanny school drew up a shortlist of suitable 
candidates after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge approached them 
looking for a nanny for Prince George, from which the royal couple chose
 the low-key Spaniard.

They
 decided to hire a nanny after first relying on help from the Duchess' mother,
 Carole Middleton, and the Duke's former nanny, Jessie Webb, 71.

Miss
 Borrallo, who is thought to be the first foreign nanny chosen to look 
after a future British monarch, comes from a smart family of high 
achievers in Palencia, 140 miles north of Madrid.

When
 her parents, Luis and Maria Teresa, married in a glamorous Roman 
Catholic ceremony in Madrid in 1967, the wedding was reported in the 
society pages of Spain's royalist right-wing daily newspaper, ABC.

Miss Borrallo was born in Madrid, and is the only girl in a family of 
four children, with brothers named Ignacio, Luis and Pablo.

Mummy and me: Prince George looks very much at home in his mother's arms in a play group in New Zealand last week

Ignacio
 is a viola and violin teacher in Spain's Castile and Leon region, Luis 
is a Catholic deacon in the south of France, and Pablo is a teacher. 

Their father, a well-known engineer, 
died of cancer but their mother, a housewife who also teaches disabled 
children, still lives in the spacious family apartment in the centre of 
Palencia, to which they moved from Madrid in the 1980s.

Nicknamed
Santa, which means Saint, when she was young, Miss Borrallo was 
expected to become a nun by childhood friends who said the shy, serious 
child was a 'good person' with an austere lifestyle who never showed any
interest in boys. 

Because I'm happy! Prince George looks cheerful as he plays with toys during a visit to the Plunket nurse and parents group at Government House in Wellington

The 
devoutly Catholic family attended Mass nearly every day, and Miss 
Borrallo had extra coaching from a neighbour to help her overcome her 
struggles in chemistry, physics and maths for her baccalaureate exams.

Neighbours
 said the young girl was not a 'short skirt type', and never seemed to 
go through the typically rebellious teenage phase.  

She was a girl distinct from the rest
 who hardly had any friends and didn't show any interest in boys', said a
 neighbour.  'We all thought she would end up becoming a nun.'

Instead,
 a passion for children drove her first to take a degree in teaching in 
Spain, before moving to Britain more than 20 years ago to learn English 
and pursue a career in childcare.

She
 is believed to have worked for other families in Britain before taking the 
job at Kensington Palace.

Her
 mother said recently: 'I am very proud of my daughter, that's all I can
 say.  On the personal front, and professionally, my daughter couldn't 
be better.'
