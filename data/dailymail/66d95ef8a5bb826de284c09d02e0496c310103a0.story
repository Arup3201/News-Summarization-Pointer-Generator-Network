A father trying to help his 16-year-old stepdaughter  was shot dead this morning by her boyfriend from the upstairs window of the teenage couple's Pennsylvania home.

Jerred Price, 42, was killed on his stepdaughter's front lawn after Jerald Thompson, 18, took aim with a .22-caliber rifle from the second-floor. 

Police said Price was shot twice - once in the head.  

Jerald Thompson (pictured), 18, shot dead his girlfriend's stepfather Jerred Price, 42, from the upstairs window of the couple's home. Thompson fired at Price twice, including once in the head 

Price, 42, and his ex-wife had gone to the home before 4am because his stepdaughter Logan called and asked to be picked up after she had a fight with Thompson. 

Logan had told them that Thompson was armed and she feared for the safety of the couple's seven-month old son, police said, according to the Observer-Reporter. 

City Detective Daniel Stanek said Price and Thompson argued inside the house before the stepfather went outside and stood with his ex-wife and Logan in the courtyard, ready to leave. 

Thompson continued to argue with Price from the upstairs window before he fired the two shots. 

Investigators are unsure if Price, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was 'facing the apartment or walking away' during the shooting. 

The baby was in a different upstairs bedroom with Thompson's mother, who also lives in the house, when the shooting occurred. 

Price's cousin Eadrik Davenport called the violence 'senseless'.

'It didn't have to happen,' he said. 

He spoke highly of the man who was like a brother, saying he was not surprised Price had tried to help his ex-wife and stepdaughter. 

Thompson has been charged with homicide and reckless endangerment. 

He is being held in the Washington County jail without bond.
