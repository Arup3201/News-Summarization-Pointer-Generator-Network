Less is more is a wise mantra, especially when it comes to make-up products.

As a beauty blogger, I am lucky enough to try out all sorts of amazing goodies, and I'm always on the look out for innovative new purchases.

However, rather than stuffing my make-up bag with tons and tons of items, I regularly edit my kit to ensure I only carry what I need.

This week Binky shows you how to achieve a great evening look without looking too over-done

Old make-up does go off and not only loses its effectiveness, but can end up tasting and smelling less than perfect. A few weeks ago I gave my daytime cosmetics a summer refresh, and it felt great to dump all the dried-out mascaras and curdled lip glosses.

So this week I'm rebooting my nighttime beauty bag - chucking away tired items and investing in some new kit.

When it came to picking the perfect evening products, I took my inspiration from the sultry look I was given on a recent photo shoot for Rimmel. Smokey eyes and nude lips are true beauty classics, and easy to achieve using the following buys:

BINKY'S EVENING KIT

bareMinerals Ready To Go Complexion Perfection Palette.

This is a very nifty all-in-one face palette that ensures you can create a flawless base whether you're at home or on the go. Cover blemishes with the Ready Foundation and the Correcting Concealer, sculpt and highlight with the Bronzer and the Luminizer, and then finish with a flourish of the Touch Up Veil to set it all in place. Clever!

Guerlain Terracotta 4 Seasons Tailor Made Bronzing Powder

It goes without saying that my evening kit contains a bronzer as I love to give my skin a warm, sexy glow. Guerlain bronzers are the original and the best, and this is my current fave. As the name suggests, it has four different shades so you can adapt the finish according to your skin tone and the lighting.

Clarins Eye Quartet Mineral Palette in Vibrant Light

An eye palette is an evening must-have as you don't want to be lugging around endless pots and powders. This little gem from Clarins contains exactly the shimmering shades you need to create the perfect smokey eye.

The soft pink is a great base tone, the rich grey and navy add depth and detail, while a dot of the glistening silver in the inner corners of your eyes adds a luxe finishing touch and really makes your eyes sparkle.

Dior Diorshow Art Pen Felt-Tip Eyeliner

An eyeliner is another important buy - whether you're going for a subtle streak during the day or an intense swoosh for evening, liner adds instant glamour.

If you're after a smudgy finish then a soft eye pencil will work, but I prefer a strong clean cat's-eye flick that you get with a liner pen. This one has a felt-tip applicator, which delivers a clean, precise and intense line.

Daniel Sandler Jumbo Jet Mascara

A great mascara is a no-brainer - a few extra coats will boost your lashes from daytime pretty to nighttime gorgeous.

It's vital that you regularly refresh your mascara as it will dry out and lose its effectiveness, try not to pump the brush and let air into the tube.

This one is amazing - it's by Daniel Sandler, a celebrity make-up artist who really knows what makes a great product - and it creates lush evening lashes without clumping or spiking.

Stila Lip Glaze in Lemongrass

This look would work well with a traditional lipstick, but I'm a total lip-gloss girl so this Stila product is a dream find for me. It has the easy application and texture of a gloss, but with the pigmentation level of a lipstick.

It comes in a fabulous range of shades, and this nude works a treat when you're rocking a smokey eye. Sheer brilliance!
