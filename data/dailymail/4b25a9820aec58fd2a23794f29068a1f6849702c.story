The trend of sharing photographs online heralds the end of the photo album, research shows.

It found that two thirds of Britons now catalogue their pictures on computers, tablets or smartphones.

Around one in five take photos with the intention of posting them on sites such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.

Dying trend: Britons are no longer using traditional photo albums and instead posting their pictures on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram

Old fashioned: Only 13 per cent of 18 to 24 year olds have ever owned a photo album

Meanwhile the ‘selfie’ – a snap taken by the photographer holding a camera at arm’s length – has become the most popular image captured by young people.

These account for 30 per cent of the pictures shot by those aged 18 to 24 and, according to the study, men take more pictures of themselves than women.

On average, 1.9billion photographs are taken each month in Britain and 328million of these are shared online, electronics giant Samsung said.

Some 10 per cent of those consulted said their photographs were 'gone in 60 seconds'.

This means they were captured on a smartphone and zipped on to a website in less than a minute.

Uploading: More than half of 3,000 Britons surveyed said that they post pictures online within a week of them being taken

More than half of 3,000 Britons surveyed said they ensured their photographs were shared online within a week.

The firm, which analysed data from OnePoll, said: ‘People are taking more photos than ever before and they naturally want to be able to share them instantly.

'The growing trend in sharing photography online is also resulting in the death of the photo album.'

More than half - 53 per cent - claimed they preferred to use Facebook and only 13 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds said they had ever used an album.

Other findings from the study - which was designed to provide insight into photography and photo sharing trends - revealed barriers such as difficulties downloading pictures meant 34 per cent of people did not share any of their photos.
