Some women would be mortified if their boyfriend posted a picture of them in their underwear on a huge billboard by a busy junction.

But once model Michelina-Lucia Salerno had gotten over the initial shock of seeing this bright pink sign she accepted the proposal and has now said she will be upset when it has to come down.

The 28-year-old's boyfriend Marios Panayitou, 30, had the sign, with the words 'Michelina Will You Marry Me', plastered on to the billboard at the junction of Hammersmith Road and North End Road, in 
West London.

Miss Salerno, a model and make-up artist, said she will be sad when the sign has to come down

Miss Salerno, from Ebbsfleet, in Kent, told MailOnline her boyfriend, from Southgate, North London, drove her to the road after picking her up at the train station, before stopping nearby, claiming they were going to get something to eat.

He then took her past the sign, although she didn't immediately realise what it was.

She said: 'I looked up because I saw something really bright but then I looked up and said "oh my god - that's my picture!".

'I was really surprised, we were both shaking - I didn't think it would be like that.

'I knelt down on one knee and proposed. I said "yes" there and then - people were stopping and taking pictures.'

Miss Salerno said the couple are now planning to have an engagement party at the end of this summer, before getting married at the end of next summer.

According to the model's Twitter account, the proposal was a roaring success

She said since the billboard went up in February she has had thousands of messages congratulating the pair, even from people she has never known before.

She said: 'There's been a lot of nice comments saying congratulations and things like that, so it's been really sweet and it's made it more magical that people I don't know have messaged me and congratulated us.

'It was weird seeing it at first because I wasn't expecting it. I just saw it and I thought "that's my bum in everyone's faces", but it didn't bother me.

'I will be upset when it comes down.'

The model accepted the proposal, according to this tweet
