A pageant contestant suffering from alopecia was crowned beauty queen this weekend after taking the brave decision to ditch her wig.

Angelica Galindez, 19, from Salt Lake City, Utah, was initially accepted into the Miss Philippines Earth USA contest based on a photograph of her wearing a long, brunette hairpiece.

But this Saturday as she stepped up to the stage in California, she decided to embrace her 'natural form' and show her bald head - a courageous act which saw her win her one of six victory crowns.

'I surprised myself, because I didn't think I could do it,' the teenager told KUTV.com.

'I was trying to dance backstage to pump myself up, cause I've never done anything like this before, never performed in front of anyone.'

Angelica was diagnosed with alopecia, when she was 12 years old.

The condition causes the immune system to
 mistakenly attack hair follicles, leading to hair loss on the scalp and
 other parts of the body.

She said when her hair first started 
falling out she found it 'very challenging' and children at school would
 tease her for having bald patches.

'The hard part was just looking at myself
 in the mirror - I cried a lot, I slept a lot, just to 
sleep away the pain'

'The hard part was just looking at myself in the mirror,' she recalled. 'I cried a lot, I slept a lot, just to sleep away the pain.'

Her mother, Patricia also admits that was a very difficult time for both her, and her daughter.

'As a teenager, an adolescent, it was difficult. School teachers were asking her to take her hat off in school.'

Angelica said she had never dreamed about
 entering a beauty pageant but a family friend entered her into the Miss
 Philippines Earth USA contest and her application was accepted.

Although she lives in Salt Lake City, Angelica's Filipino father qualifies her to compete.

Initially, Angelica said she was hesitant to participate in the competition, but she decided to take advantage of an opportunity that could raise awareness about alopecia.

She asked organizers if she could participate without her wig and they fully supported her decision.

On Saturday she earned the title of Miss Philippines Water 2014.

Now the full-time beautician, will spend the next six months preparing for the pageant’s final round, which takes place in April in the Philippines.

'All they really told me was “get prepared to go to the Philippines and tone up,” it's a lot of work to be in a pageant,’ she concluded.
