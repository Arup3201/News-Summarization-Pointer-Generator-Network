American John Hahn produced the round of his life to shoot an incredible 58 in the fourth round of the European Tour's qualifying school in Spain.

However, the 25-year-old will not be able to claim an official record as preferred lies were in place on the par-70 Tour Course at the PGA Catalunya Resort in Girona.

Hahn recorded 12 birdies, which was perfectly timed as he leapt from six shots outside the cut mark to inside the top 15 with two days remaining.

The American is no stranger to outrageous scoring this season, having carded an eventful 65 in the final round of the Italian Open, where he began eagle-birdie-birdie-birdie on his way to an outward 28, but despite getting to nine under through 10 holes he had a quadruple-bogey seven on the short 13th to derail any chance of a sub-60 round.

There have been lower scores than Hahn's at European Tour events but they too did not qualify for an official record.

Scotland's Scott Jamieson and South Africa Jaco van Zyl both carded a 57 at the 2013 Nelson Mandela Championship on a dramatically shortened course reduced to a par 65 after heavy rainfall affected the Royal Durban Golf Club.
