Martin Odegaard will be added to Football Manager 2015 - after his father Hans Erik granted game developer Sports Interactive permission to include the 15-year-old wonderkid from Norway.

Martin, who turns 16 in December, was absent from the game's list due to his age but Hans Erik wants his son to feature.

Miles Jacobson, studio director of Sports Interactive, tweeted a photo of the teenager's father giving his blessing and wrote: 'I said if we got parental permission, Odegaard would be added to #FM15.'

The note held by Hans Erik, assistant manager of Norwegian club Mjondalen, read: 'I hereby grant you permission to add Martin Odegaard to Football Manager 15. Best wishes, Hans Erik Odegaard, father.'

Martin, who plays as an attacking midfielder for Stromsgodset, has been on the radar of Europe's elite clubs, including Manchester United, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid.

But the youngster is a fan of Liverpool and will go on trial with the club before Christmas.

He underwent a similar trial with Real and has had offers from Ajax and United.
