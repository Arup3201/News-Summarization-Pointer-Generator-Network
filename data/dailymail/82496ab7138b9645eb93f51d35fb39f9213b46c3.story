Chinese relatives of the passengers on missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 have had to change hotels to make way for crews arriving for the Malaysian Grand Prix.

The news comes as an expert who has been helping the families through their ordeal expressed fears that some had become suicidal.

Some
 Chinese family members who flew to Malaysia to be 
closer to the heart of search operations had been staying at the 
Cyberview Resort & Spa near Kuala Lumpur, where they were engaged in
an emotional struggle to elicit information from the 
government.

'The Chinese families were here, but they have already left,' a worker at the resort said. 'We are fully booked. 'There is no space because of Formula One.'

Despair: There are fears that some family members could be contemplating suicide

Malaysian officials said the families would be put up at another hotel.

The Grand Prix is one of the biggest sporting events in Malaysia, when room
 rates at some hotels soar as drivers, their teams and sponsors travel 
to Kuala Lumpur for the weekend race.

Several
 foreign officials, investigators and journalists are also being forced 
by the event to move out of a hotel near the Kuala Lumpur international 
airport, which had become the ad hoc headquarters for coordinating 
search operations.

'We will be moving out of here because the F1 race is going to go on,' Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said.

Technicians are arriving well in advance of the March 30 race, which takes place about 10 minutes from the airport.

Mystery: There has been no sign of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 for the past two weeks

Paul Yin, a psychologist who has worked with the passengers' families in Beijing, suggested that some were so overcome with grief that they had contemplated suicide.

He told ABC News that the families were fluctuating between hope that their relatives might be alive, and despair at the thought that they may never be found.

Mr Yin added that many were latching on to wild rumours and conspiracy theories in a bid to find solace.

'In the Chinese culture when a person gets to a certain age, the meaning of life is about your grandchildren - your legacy,' he said.

'So when that is taken away, it is difficult for some of them to think of reason to live, a reason to stay around.'
