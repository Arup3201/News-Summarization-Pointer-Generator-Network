A freediver with ten years' experience has drowned just days before he was planning to quit the sport after his wife gave birth to their first child.

The body of Yevgeniy 'Eugene' Glebov, from Staten Island, was discovered yesterday, four days after he was swept out to sea.

Mr Glebov had embarked on a spear-hunting dive in the rough waters off the Rockaways area of New York and had been hunting giant bass without an air tank.

He was found dead in his diving gear by a crew aboard a tugboat.

The 29-year-old Brighton Beach lifeguard who had planned to stop diving after the pending birth of his daughter, was still wearing his fins, wetsuit and depth gauge when his body was spotted close toÂ  Beach 217th Street about three miles from where he had disappeared on Friday.

Aunt Sonya Kordonsky told the New York Post: 'His wife is having a baby in two weeks. This is terrible. He loved life; he loved people.'

Mr Glebov's cousin, Anna Andreyeva, 24, added, 'The baby will be named after him: Eugenia. He was excited to be a father. He wanted to drop his passion for a new passion.'

The diver was a seasoned participant in the pastime and spent every summer's day exploring deep waters, without the use of any breathing apparatus.

He was supposed to meet a friend on Friday to dive for striped bass, but seemingly went in alone. By 3pm, the friend reported him missing.

The experienced diver may have died from a condition called shallow- water blackout 
triggered by a lack of carbon dioxide combined with a drop in oxygen 
levels

Authorities said there were no obvious signs of trauma on his body and yesterday family members including Mr Glebov's mother Valentina, 54, and his father Valeriy, 65, hugged and cried on a pier in Riis Park, close to the New York Police Department's harbour boat.

Valeriy Glebov said: 'Two weeks ago, he rescued a girl . . . stuck in a fishing net. We were hoping for a miracle. We were really hoping he would be found alive.'

Former NYPD scuba instructor Bill Reddan said Glebov may have died from a condition called shallow- water blackout triggered by a lack of carbon dioxide combined with a drop in oxygen levels which usually happens about five feet below the surface.

However Mr Reddan also speculated that the diver may have become tangled up in some sort of netting and thought lack of visibility may have been a factor.
