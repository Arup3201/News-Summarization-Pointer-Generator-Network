Facebook has officially revealed a new video-sharing service for Instagram during a product launch at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters.

Called Video on Instagram, the service adds a video icon to the existing 
Instagram app and users can record 15-second video clips and edit them 
together for longer videos.

Video on Instagram pits the firm against Twitter’s hugely popular Vine app, which lets users record and share six-second clips.

Facebook has officially revealed a new video sharing service. Called Video on Instagram, it will pit the firm against Twitter's hugely popular Vine service by letting users record 15-second video clips

The Video on Instagram service is available on iOS and Android. It lets users record 15-second clips, add 13 filters and comes with a stablisation tool called Cinema that fixes shaky camerawork

Users record 15-second clips using Instagram’s existing app.

Clips can be added together for longer videos.

They can choose one of 13 video filters.

Jerky video can be automatically stabilised.

Users can choose a cover picture.

Video appears on Facebook profiles and in feeds in the same way pictures do.

There are also 13 new filters to give the videos the same retro feel as Instagram's pictures.

‘We need to do to video what we did to photographs,’ said Kevin Systrom, the head of Instagram.

‘It’s the same Instagram we know and love, but it moves,’ said Systrom.

‘130 million people will be using this from today - that’s really powerful.

‘I’m really excited about this, and I think the world will be.’

‘It’s a tool to remember, and about capturing moments; a way to stay connected.’

Before the announcement Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said: ‘We want to talk about something a 
little different.

‘People want to share a lot of different types of content.

‘Today, we’re going to focus on Instagram. In the last year we’ve tripled the team, and the community 
has more than 100million members. But we’re really just getting started here.’

The app is available on the iPhone and Android devices.

The app can also automatically improve video to remove jitters, using a feature called Cinema - although it is only be available for the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5.

This stabilisation feature is turned on by default but users can turn it off by pressing the Cinema icon. 

Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram last year. It has now added a video icon, left, to the existing app. The service pits Facebook and Instagram against Twitter's hugely popular Vine app, right. When users share an Instagram video on Facebook it will be visible and play within the same window

16 billion photos shared.

1 billion likes every day.

130 million people use Instagram every month.

Commenting on the announcement, Eden 
Zoller, a consumer analyst at Ovum said: 'Given the popularity of 
Twitter’s Vine service, it is perhaps more surprising that Facebook has 
not introduced video for Instagram sooner.

‘But new features aside, Facebook 
still needs to come up with a strategy for how to monetize Instagram 
which so far it has failed to do.'

Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 after an alleged bidding war with Twitter.

Freelance journalist Matthew Keys broke the Instagram video story at the end of May.

He claimed a source familiar with
the plans had told him Facebook was testing the feature, but didn't 
want to give their name because they were not permitted to speak 
publicly about the news. 

Facebook announced earlier this month it was 
adding clickable hashtags to the site which make it easier for users to 
follow discussions about certain topics.

Clickable hashtags are already used widely on Instagram as well as Twitter and Vine. 

A video produced by Instagram to show off the new service and its features showed users recording clips of various objects and scenarios, including a dog in a hat smoking a pipe, left, and a cat chasing wool, right

Twitter bought Vine in October last year.

The app initially launched on iOS devices before being made available for Android phones earlier this month.

Vine has previously been used to record surgical operations and at the start of June a 16-year-old claimed he had managed to crash the app by uploading a Rick Astley music video.

The video bypassed the app's six-second limit which is thought to have caused the servers to temporarily crash.
