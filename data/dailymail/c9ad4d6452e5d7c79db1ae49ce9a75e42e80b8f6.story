Prom is supposed to be one of best nights of the year for high school juniors and seniors, but sometimes it doesn't turn out that way. 

Looking back at prom photos is sometimes an easy way to see why.

Weird haircuts, strange poses and wardrobe choices that are just wrong await in the latest set of pictures from Awkward Family Photos.  

Is it worse to be her, him or the rug? Maybe they thought it was a magic carpet or something. Guess not

No tuxedo, no trousers, no smile, no problem... At least the fringe on the jean shorts looks classy 

There are three chandeliers in the background at this place. They didn't help to distract from the foreground 

Maybe the laser show in the background was an attempt to call attention away from the suit. It didn't work

They had their spot on the dance floor marked off with a stack of telephone books for him to stand on 

The question is, who ended up with the flowers at the end of the night?

Where these guys were so serious looking because they were planning to fight over her after the photo was taken?

When you don't have a date, the best solution is always to go with a giant fish in a dress

The mustache is awesome. The jacket and pants are even kind of cool. But the chair makes this guy shine

At least this guy didn't have to worry about shelling out for a limo or sticking his date with the corsage

As soon as the dance was over, they ran off to go compete on American Gladiators. Didn't need to change

Though the sunglasses made it harder for them to see other people, it doesn't work the other way around

It's a well-known fact there's no better way to attract a suitor than by taking a photo with a tractor

They seem really, really happy. Wonder how they would feel if they saw this photo again?

Their first date was probably to go see the Breakfast Club or something else involving Molly Ringwald
