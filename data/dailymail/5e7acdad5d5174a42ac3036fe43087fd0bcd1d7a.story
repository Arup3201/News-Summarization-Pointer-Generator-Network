Manchester United are stepping up their attempts to sign a new goalkeeper in the January transfer window after telling Ben Amos that he is free to find another club.

With Anders Lindegaard also set to leave Old Trafford, Louis van Gaal could have two vacancies to fill to provide better competition for No 1 David de Gea.

Amos, 24, has been with the club since the age of 11 and made his debut in a League Cup win over Middlesbrough in 2008, but the last of his seven senior appearances came nearly three years ago.

United have told the former England Under 21 international that they will not stand in his way if he receives other offers.

Lindegaard, meanwhile, has been linked with Molde and a possible swap dealing involving Norway goalkeeper Orjan Nyland.

The 30-year-old Dane almost left Old Trafford last summer when Van Gaal made an unsuccessful attempt to hijack Kenneth Vermeer’s move from Ajax to Feyenoord with a player-plus-cash bid.

Lindegaard has since drifted out of contention as a serious rival to De Gea and has not played at all this season. It was thought he might have been called up for Sunday’s FA Cup tie at Yeovil but Van Gaal left him on the bench again.

News that Amos could follow Lindegaard out of the club has only increased the possibility of Victor Valdes being offered a contract to come in as back-up for De Gea. The former Barcelona keeper has been training at Carrington since late October as he recovers from a serious knee injury.

Meanwhile Luke Shaw should be fit to face his old club Southampton at Old Trafford on Sunday despite coming off at half-time against Yeovil.

There were concerns the England defender might have suffered a recurrence of the ankle injury that kept him out for six weeks recently, but tests have confirmed there is no damage.

Rafael also failed to appear for the second half at Huish Park and United are still waiting for the results of scans amid fears the Brazilian defender has fractured his cheekbone.
