A Danish tourist was gang-raped near a popular shopping area in New Delhi after she stopped to ask for directions in the latest case to draw attention to the scourge of violence against women in India, police said today. 

The 51-year-old woman was also robbed and beaten in the attack, which happened yesterday afternoon or early evening near Connaught Place, police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said.

The woman had lost her way and was trying to get back to her hotel, he said.

She approached a group of men for directions, but they lured her to a secluded area where they raped her at knife-point over a three-hour period, according to the Press Trust of India news agency.

The woman managed to reach her hotel Tuesday evening and the owner called police.

Police have arrested two men and detained two others in connection with the alleged attack - and revealed that one of the attackers swapped clothes with the victim.

He put on her tracksuit bottoms and gave her his jeans to wear, which will provide vital DNA evidence, police said.

The victim has now flown back to Denmark but was in such a state of exhaustion that she collapsed at the airport.

'When
 she came, it was miserable,' said Amit Bahl, owner of the Amax Hotel in
 the Paharganj area, which is popular with backpackers.

The woman was crying and 'not in good shape,' he said.

'I am really ashamed that this happened,' said Bahl, who sounded shaken.

The Danish Embassy had no comment.

The problem of sexual violence in 
India has gained widespread attention since the horrific gang rape and 
murder of a 23-year-old woman on a moving bus in December 2012.

Public
 fury over the case has led to more stringent laws that doubled prison 
terms for rape to 20 years and criminalized voyeurism and stalking.

But
 for many women, particularly the poor, daily indignities and abuse 
continue unabated and the new laws have not made the streets any safer.

Ranjana
 Kumari, Director of India's Center for Social Research, said India's 
conservative, patriarchal traditions lead men to use rape as a tool to 
instill fear in women.

'This mindset is not changing,' she said. 'It's a huge challenge.'

Experts say the rapid growth of India's cities and the yawning gulf between rich and poor are exacerbating the problem of sexual violence, with young men struggling to prove their traditional dominance in a changing world.

Cultural stigmas, police apathy and judicial incompetence have long made it difficult for women to even report rapes.

Still, there has been a surge in the number of rapes being reported recently, suggesting women are emboldened to speak up. Between January and October last year, 1,330 rapes were reported in Delhi and its suburbs, compared with 706 for all of 2012, according to government figures.

Foreigners also have been targets, including a Swiss woman who was cycling with her husband in central India when she was gang-raped.

The cases threaten India's lucrative tourism industry. Last year, the Tourism Ministry launched an 'I Respect Women' campaign to reassure travelers.

Tourism accounted for 6.6 per cent of India's GDP in 2012, the latest year for which figures are available.

Fighting back: Indian Olympic boxer Mary Kom has launched an app giving tips on how to fend off a sex attacker after she was forced to defend an assault from a rickshaw driver

The fear of sexual attack for women in India has become so prevalent it has inspired the country's top female boxer to launch an app to protect potential victims.

And the techniques are known to work... as the fighter behind them once used her skills to save herself from a sex attacker.

Years before becoming a champion boxer, Mary Kom, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics representing her native India, had to fend off an attack from a rikshaw driver.

Recalling her escape, she said: 'I remember I went to church wearing a traditional wraparound dress. I was 18 years old and looked very ladylike.

'The rikshaw driver wanted to do bad things. We were travelling through a quiet area when he tried to do what he wanted.'

But, re-enacting the powerful punches that left her attacker with a broken nose, Kom added: 'Boom, boom, boom... he was on the ground - finished.'

Standing just 5ft 2in, Kom is a far from intimidating figure. 

But her fighting skills are borne of a natural confidence that she now wants to pass on to the women of India as the country struggles to deal with an increasing number of sexual attacks on women.

In partnership with mobile phone providers Vodafone, she has developed an app that will launch later this year, offering basic self-defence tips for women as well as advice and support.

The app will include videos demonstrating how to fight off an attacker, with techniques that are simple for anyone to use: From punches and kicks, to scratching with nails and striking with high heeled shoes.

But the aim is not just to prepare women physically.

Help at hand: Kom's app will demonstrate basic techniques from punches and kicks to scratching with nails

What Kom hopes to achieve is ensure that women develop a confidence in themselves, even if it that only means feeling safer when they walk along the street.

'The app teaches basic things for people who have not done [boxing] before. If it is to hard for them, it will not interest them. 

'Hopefully, if they are interested, they will continue to learn.'

The techniques taught are basic. But they could mean the difference between life or death.Part of the problem is that India's women are continuing to be seen in some quarters as second class citizens. 

It is a social prejudice Kom has dealt with all her life as the eldest of five siblings growing up in rural Kangathei.

'When I was a little girl I was always playing fighting games. I was very interested in sports but nobody in my village knew what to do with me.

'People try to discourage what women do. I began my sports career to help my father financially but people say "you are a girl, you can't do this" or "you are a woman you must do this". I want to give girls the confidence that if a man can do it, they can do it.

'I was the eldest and helping my father but people in the village were telling me not to do things but I would not let it get to me.'

The app is just part of Kom's attempts to help women through boxing, having also set up a female fighting club in her home region of Manipur.

The club is funded by Vodafone and its new 'Firsts' programme, which supports and encourages first time experiences.
