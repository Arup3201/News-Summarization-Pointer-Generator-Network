Primary school children can't cope with cutlery when eating school dinners meaning much of their lunch ends up in the bin, a headteacher has claimed.

Keira Ainsworth said the introduction of free school meals for all pupils is causing a huge amount of waste because children are used to nibbling at finger food in front of the television rather than eating at a table.

She explained that she and staff at Maids Moreton C of E School in Buckingham are forced to cut up food for more than 50 pupils aged four to eight who are unable to properly use knives and forks.

Despite its location in an affluent area, she claims children refuse to eat traditional puddings but some parents expect an organic menu. 

Ms Ainsworth told The Times: 'We were shocked to discover that children did not know how to use a knife and fork and by the time the two supervisors had cut up 50 roast dinners, the lunches had gone cold.

'The school bursar and myself now cut up the food every day to make sure that it is served hot, acting as two rather overpaid dinner ladies.'

She added: 'Modern children are unfamiliar with traditional hot puddings such as apple crumble and custard, and bakewell tart, so much of the food goes in the bin.'

The universal school meals project was launched by Nick Clegg at the start of the academic year in 2014 aiming to provide a healthy lunch for all pupils in state-funded schools. 

Miss Ainsworth said the £1billion scheme was not funded well enough.

She explained that as a small school, Maids Moreton received approximately £18,000 but estimated annual costs, including staff, paying suppliers and running an industrial dishwasher, will cost around £32,000.

A nearby school was forced to convert its library into a kitchen and another put off the planned purchase of iPads to fund the costs of a new kitchen. 

In October, David Laws, the Minister of State for Schools said the government was making an additional £20million of capital funding available for projects aimed at enhancing kitchen and dining facilities.
