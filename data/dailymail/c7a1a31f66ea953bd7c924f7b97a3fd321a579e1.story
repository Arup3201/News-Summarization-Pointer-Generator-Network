Katie Couric’s big money move from Today to CBS News and the subsequent criticism she received over flagging ratings left the under fire star comparing herself to Hillary Clinton, a new book has revealed.

During her 15 years on the Today show, Couric was dubbed ‘America's Sweetheart' but that was before she jumped ship to join CBS Evening News in 2006 and became the highest paid journalist in the world earning $15 million a year.

The move quickly turned sour and Couric was left facing a mountain of growing criticism which she wasn’t used to, according to a new book – The News Sorority: Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Christiane Amanpour - And The (Ongoing, Imperfect, Complicated) Triumph of Women In TV.

During her 15 years on the Today show, Katie Couric was dubbed 'America's Sweetheart' but that was before she jumped ship to join CBS Evening News in 2006 and became the highest paid journalist in the world

‘In private, Katie - who had recently turned 50 - was now beginning to actively and repeatedly compare herself to the embattled but energized Hillary Clinton,’ writes author Shelia Weller.

‘Katie deeply related to Hillary; she felt she was being pummeled as the first female anchor just like Clinton was being pummeled as the first major female presidential candidate.’

Behind the scenes, Couric’s massive salary and supposed superstar attitude, mean’t she wasn’t popular with other members of the team.

‘The resentment was virtually immediate,’ a CBS correspondent told Weller.

'Katie deeply related to Hillary,' writes author Shelia Weller in her new book about the high profile TV journalist

‘The burden was on her,’ Weller wrote. ‘People were waiting to see her disprove the reputation she arrived with. You’ve gotta be conscious of the fact that you’re making at least ten or fifteen or twenty times more than anybody on the show.’

Several of Couric’s colleagues at CBS were less than impressed when they were asked to take pay cuts in the wake of her massive deal.

Morley Safer was supposed to earn 30% less, Lesley Stahl was asked to take $500,000 less in salary and Ed Bradley – who died soon after from leukemia - was also supposed to take a cut, according to an extract from the book first published by the New York Daily News.

Couric was described as unfriendly and abrasive by ex-CBS staffers interviewed for the book.

‘Katie can put on a charm offensive if she wants to,’ the book says. ‘But really, she doesn’t give a s*** about you only as much as it affected her.’

Katie Couric was described as unfriendly and abrasive by ex-CBS News staffers, while the show failed in the ratings war too

Instead of taking on the ‘real work’ associated with being a managing editor, the book says, ‘Katie was out doing other things.’

‘She was being a star,’ Weller wrote.

In 2011, Couric returned to ABC News as a special correspondent and in 2012 she signed a record $40 million contract to host the ill-fated daytime talk show Katie.

The show was cancelled after two seasons due to poor ratings and a reported disdain of her core female audience. The last ever episode was filmed last week.

In November 2013, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer hired Couric, 57, as Global Anchor of Yahoo News.

Couric, who is getting married this summer, debuted in her latest role in January, but has faced growing criticism over her failure to land big-name interviews. She launched with an interview with former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.

The News Sorority focuses on three of the biggest female names in television journalism – Couric, Diane Sawyer and Christiane Amanpour – who Weller writes 'have infiltrated the once impenetrable "boys club" and become cultural icons.'

The bestselling author has carried out exclusive interviews with many former colleagues.

Ex-colleagues of Diane Sawyer have spoken about how she made life miserable for overnight staffers at ABC News, frequently calling them at 1 a.m. and demanding different stories get covered.

Despite concerns that the segments would never run, staff were forced to comply with her demands or else.

'If you didn’t do it, and she found out you didn’t do it, she would triple your agony for the next few weeks by calling in at one a.m. more often, wanting more stories, checking back to make sure you were working on them,' writes Weller.
