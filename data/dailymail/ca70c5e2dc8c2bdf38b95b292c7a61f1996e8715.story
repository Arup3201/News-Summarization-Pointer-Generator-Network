2013 has been a stellar year so far for gap-toothed model Georgia May Jagger.

She was last week unveiled as the face of Miu Miu, and is also one of the face's of Just 
Cavalli, as well as Madonna’s Material Girl.

But as the 21-year-old smoulders for her latest campaign, she has revealed that there may be a drastic career change on the horizon.

'I wanted to be a vet when I was growing up, so I can definitely imagine doing that.

'I love animals. I also really enjoy photography, so I would like to do more of that in the future,' she told Vogue.co.uk.

The young British muse was speaking as she posed as the face of Hudson's autumn/winter 2013-14 denim campaign.

Shot by Sebastian Kim with art direction by Patrizio Micelli and the Al Dente agency, Georgia stars alongside Spanish model Jon Kortajarena, who has modelled for the likes of Just Cavalli, Versace, Giorgio Armani and Tom Ford.

Speaking about the campaign, Mick Jagger's daughter said: 'I really love the Hudson brand because they have the classic jeans but they have a lot of fun with the denim, too.

'I'm really big on colour and I love that they have a lot of great colour options, as well as the black and indigo skinny jeans that I like to wear every day.

'I have also been working with them for a long time now and they have an incredible team who I really enjoy working with!'

The campaign, which will be officially unveiled with a public event at Selfridges Denim Studio on July 18, is Jagger's second for the label.

'We wanted to create a campaign that revolved around our brand mantra of “Let yourself go,” and that visually set the tone which we could build on, season after season, said Hudson creative director Ben Taverniti.

'We chose black and white photography to start because of its minimally beautiful aesthetic and nature.'

Whilst for all the world Georgia exudes confidence as she struts around in a bra in her latest campaign, she still has body hang-ups like every other young girl.

In an interview with net-a-porter's digital magazine The Edit, she said: ‘There have been some interesting debates on my teeth on Instagram.'

'When 12-year-olds tell you to go and get braces and then someone answers: "Don't tell her what to do", that's really sweet.

'There's
this whole idea of perfection (in modelling) What younger girls don't 
realize is that these girls do have problems. It's good for people to 
realize everyone is human.

'I still worry I am going to look weird as I get older. I'll be a weird old woman with scary teeth.'

Her year: 2013 has been a success story so far for Georgia who walked for Louis Vuitton Fall/Winter 2013 and has been snapped up by an array of luxury fashion brands to front their campaigns
