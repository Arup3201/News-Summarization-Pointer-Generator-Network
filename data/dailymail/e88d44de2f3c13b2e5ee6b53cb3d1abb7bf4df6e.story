Richard Meade was an unparalleled British Olympian, much admired by everyone from the Royal Family to welly-wearing enthusiasts at Burghley and Badminton.

The three-time Olympic gold medallist, who died on Friday aged 76 after battling cancer since October, was the cornerstone of the British eventing team for 21 years and the country’s most successful rider at the Games.

He will forever be identified with a glorious era for equestrian events in this country when, around the Seventies, huge television audiences would follow the exploits of the nation’s leading performers. Apart from himself — swooned over by some for his rugged good looks — there were diverse characters such as David Broome, Harvey Smith and Princess Anne.

The latter and her former husband Mark Phillips became close friends with Meade. Tributes on Friday also recognised him as a true gentleman, well respected by all echelons of the equestrian community.

Meade not only became a nationally known figure, he also made household names of the horses he rode in triumph at the Mexico City Olympics of 1968 and in Munich four years later.

In Mexico he rode Cornishman to win the team gold and in 1972 was upon Laurieston as he took both team and individual gold in Munich, where he also carried the British flag at the closing ceremony.

British Eventing chairman Hugh Thomas said on Friday: ‘Richard, at the height of his powers, towered over the eventing world. His results far exceeded the innate ability of many of the horses he rode, and he was at his very best when riding at the major events and championships.

‘Then he gave countless time and effort to supporting the sport he loved. His passing really does feel like the end of an era.’

The family name does, however, live on in the sport as his son Harry is an international eventer who won a World Championships team silver medal last year.

Meade was born into a riding family in Monmouth — his parents were joint masters of the local hunt — and was mentored by his fellow Welshman Harry Llewellyn, who won team gold at the 1950 Games in Helsinki.

After graduating from Cambridge and a spell in the army he made his Olympics debut at the Tokyo Games of 1964. It was in Mexico that he heroically clinched gold for the team, with his final clear round achieved despite a torrential downpour. 

Meade went on to become a respected administrator for the sport

Meade nearly added to his Olympic medal tally by coming fourth in Montreal in 1976, but there were many other achievements in his career.

He won the Burghley Horse Trials in 1964, and twice won Badminton, in 1970 and 1982. He also claimed gold twice at the World Championships. In 1972 he came third in the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year.

After his retirement as a competitor he became a respected administrator. There was also controversy, however, when the RSPCA expelled him in 2001 for trying to encourage hunting enthusiasts to join the organisation and reverse its opposition to an activity he supported.

Meade enjoyed royal connections until the end of his life, partly though his sons, who are friends with Princes William and Harry.
