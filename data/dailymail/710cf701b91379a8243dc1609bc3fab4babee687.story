The way millions of households are being ripped off by the big energy firms is laid bare today.

Figures show customers are being charged at least three times the price their suppliers pay for gas.

Wholesale costs have halved in six months yet bills have not fallen. It means customers on British Gas’s one-year fixed-rate tariff are paying an almost four-fold mark-up.

The way millions of households are being ripped off by the big energy firms is laid bare today

British Gas, which supplies around 40 per cent of homes, and other firms are under fire for their costs at a time when the Competition and Markets Authority is holding an inquiry into the energy supply business.

Its parent company, Centrica, announced profits of £900million for the first six months of the financial year. British Gas customers are paying between £1.35 and £1.50 per therm.

Yet the wholesale gas price paid by suppliers has hit a four-year low of less than 42p per therm, down from 72p in December.

The other Big Six energy companies – nPower, EDF, SSE, E.on and Scottish Power – charge between £1.21 and £1.37 per therm.

One therm of gas is enough to power a domestic boiler at full output for almost two hours.

Richard Lloyd, of consumer group Which?, said: ‘Energy companies should be passing on any savings from falling wholesale and network costs.

‘It’s no wonder that consumers aren’t confident that the price they pay for their energy is fair, especially when Ofgem has reported that supplier profit margins are set to double.

‘With energy costs the top consumer concern, the competition authority must leave no stone unturned in its investigation of the market and must establish the truth behind our energy prices.’

He suggested that customers shop around, as small suppliers can be considerably cheaper.

For example, Extra Energy is offering a tariff that is almost 25 per cent cheaper than British Gas’s increased rate.

Energy suppliers say the wholesale price of gas is only part of the cost of providing their services – and that prices are not cut automatically if it falls.

Despite conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, prices have declined sharply because a mild winter left stocks high and fracking has reduced demand for natural gas in the US.

Most firms bulk-purchase gas in advance to buffer themselves against sudden changes in the market, so wholesale price falls do not filter through to consumers immediately.

British Gas spokesman Tim Cowen said: 
‘The wholesale cost of energy is now less than half the bill, which 
partly explains why the wholesale price can fall, but overall prices 
don’t.

‘We also have other costs, such as regulated transport and distribution costs, that are rising.'

The company says it is offering customers opting for the £1.50 one-year fixed-rate tariff a £50 High Street gift card to mitigate the cost – and adds that users should still see their bills fall because of ‘milder weather and improved energy efficiency measures’.

The boss of one of the big six energy companies, nPower, has said Labour’s promise to  freeze energy prices if they win next year’s election is a factor in his company not reducing its prices.

But Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint rejected claims that her party’s pledge is to blame for energy firms keeping bills high. ‘It’s always the same old story – when wholesale prices go up, energy bills go through the roof, but when they fall consumers never see the full benefit,’ she said.

The competition inquiry into the energy supply business will report at the end of next year.

Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other.

Shrewd

 consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing 
deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest 
deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts.

If
 you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. 
stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big 
chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year.

People power: MAKE your provider offer you a better deal!

The
 Mail Online's award-winning money section This is Money has joined 
forces with energyhelpline to launch The Energy Switch, which could help
 you save even more.

Readers can team up with thousands of other people and use their 
collective power to negotiate a unique offer on their energy 
bills.

This one-off special
 deal will give you the chance to switch to a cheaper supplier ahead of 
any winter energy price rises and turns
 the table on energy firms - rather than households having 
to hunt out a better price, they will be competing to offer you one.

The last collective switch by energyhelpline saw 50,000 people sign up and those who switched save £221 on average.

Remember, suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.

Don't forget, prices
 are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you 
will depend where you live.

You only need to be interested in the tariff
 that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison 
to find the best price.
