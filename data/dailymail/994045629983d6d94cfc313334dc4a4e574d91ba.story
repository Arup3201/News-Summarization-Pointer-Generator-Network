Red Bull team principal Christian Horner believes it would have been 'wrong' to have imposed team orders on Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo in the Singapore Grand Prix.

With Vettel and Ricciardo running second and third over the closing laps under the lights of the Marina Bay Street Circuit behind race-winner Lewis Hamilton, Horner could easily have asked them to switch positions.

Ricciardo started the day 72 points behind Nico Rosberg, who retired early on with a wiring loom failure to his steering wheel.

The Australian ended it 60 points adrift of Hamilton, yet that could have been 57 if Horner had felt obliged to make a call on position.

With double points in the final race in Abu Dhabi, and with Mercedes' reliability record becoming more of an issue, every point could prove vital for Ricciardo.

Yet a dismissive Horner said: 'Both mathematically have a chance, even though it's a long shot.

'So it's down to them racing each other on the track. It would be wrong to interfere with that in the situation we're in.'

Ricciardo suggested after the last race in Italy it would be beneficial to his cause if the team started to favour him.

Reigning four-time champion Vettel is now 117 points adrift with 150 available, yet Horner added: 'Daniel is totally comfortable and happy with the situation.

'If there was a realistic chance of Daniel winning and Sebastian was mathematically out of the championship then we'd do the best we can for the team.

'But as I say, with the situation we're in at the moment it's a long shot.'

With Mercedes consistently tripping over themselves, Ricciardo could sneak up on Hamilton and Rosberg come the controversial ending to the campaign.

Despite that, Horner said: 'Mercedes have an enormous advantage at this point, but we'll take it one race at a time.

'Both of them are still just in it, and both have taken a chunk of points out of Nico.

'Daniel, okay he's conceded three points to Seb, but is that going to make the difference?

'That's impossible to say with a crystal ball at this stage, but at the moment it doesn't make sense to interfere with team orders.'
