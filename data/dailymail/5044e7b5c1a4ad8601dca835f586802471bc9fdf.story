Scores of NHS hospitals say they are struggling with high levels of debt and expect to end the financial year in the red.

Latest figures show 64 of England’s 145 hospital trusts – 44 per cent – predict they will be in debt by the end of next month.

The combined deficit could reach £330million, according to figures from Monitor, the regulator for foundation trusts, and the NHS Trust Development Authority, which supervises non-foundation trusts.

£50million deficit: St Barts Hospital is facing such a cash flow crisis it has drawn up plans to shed nursing staff

Patient campaigners and staff bodies fear it could mean cuts to staff and services, despite the NHS having coped well so far with winter pressures.

Many of the worst problems are in London, where Bart’s Health NHS Trust is predicting a deficit of £50million by the end of the financial year, and has drawn up plans to shed nursing staff.

Trusts in the Midlands and the East of England are also having problems, with The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust in the West Midlands and United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust both forecasting deficits of £17million.

The figures suggest the NHS will struggle to meet its target of delivering £20 billion in efficiency savings by 2015.

A survey by the King’s Fund last month found 22 per cent of NHS finance directors expected to be in deficit at the end of next month, along with 13 per cent of clinical commissioning groups, which buy services on behalf of GPs.

Professor John Appleby, chief economist at The King’s Fund, said ‘The growing number of hospitals set to overspend their budgets shows that for some, it is no longer possible both to maintain the quality of services and balance their books.

'The emerging concerns about staff morale in hospitals are very worrying as there is a proven relationship between staff satisfaction and the quality of care provided to patients.’

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, blamed ‘endless reorganisations and failed IT projects’ for wasting billions.

Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘The NHS must not under any circumstance be allowed to return to a boom and bust cyle of financial planning.’

A spokesman for Monitor said: ‘Unlike NHS Trusts – which are expected to break even every year – NHS Foundation  Trusts have more freedom to run their own affairs.

‘Monitor assesses the financial health of foundation trusts on their performance in the medium term and does not require them to break even each year.

‘They are therefore allowed to run a short-term deficit, and from a business perspective this can be an acceptable method of managing their finances.’
