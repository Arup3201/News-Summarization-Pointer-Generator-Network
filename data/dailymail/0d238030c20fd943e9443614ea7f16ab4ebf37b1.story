A restaurant-owner had his laptop stolen from his table as he enjoyed an al fresco lunch outside of his own eatery.

Proprietor David Moore and a colleague were left open-mouthed after a thief casually strolled past them before snatching the Apple MacBook and then roaring off on a motorbike driven by a waiting accomplice.

They had been lunching outside exclusive L'Autre Pied in Marylebone, London, and watched a presentation on the laptop, before leaving it sitting on the table as they talked.

Mr Moore and his colleague were enjoying coffee as the thief strolled toward them

CCTV caught the thief, who was clad in a motorcycle outfit, clutching the MacBook as he dashed away, with both Mr Moore and his colleague chasing after him.

Mr Moore, 48, who also owns the Pied a Terre restaurant in Fitzrovia, told the Evening Standard: 'We were having coffee when this guy walks past and grabbed the laptop off the table. He was as cool as a cucumber.

'He ran off to an accomplice who was awaiting near-by on a scooter and they sped off. It was all over in a few seconds.

'We both reacted very quickly and ran after him but he was too quick.'

Apple MacBook Pro versions begin at £999, while a MacBook Air costs fro £849.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman 
confirmed officers were called to reports of a theft in Blandford Street
at around 3.30pm last Friday, the Evening Standard reported.

Snatch and grab thefts have rocketed in the past year.

In January, figures showed thefts of mobile phones in London have soared by 64 per cent over the past three years, with 300 mobiles being stolen every day.

Many of the thieves are youths on bikes or mopeds but others, often thefts from crowded bars, are organised by mainly Eastern European crime gangs.

Nearly 10,000 phones were stolen in December last year alone.

In December 2009 there were 5,915 offences and in December 2010, there were 8,078 offences committed.

In January Scotland Yard launched an advertising campaign to warn Londoners of the risks of phone and jewellery snatches.

One advert showing a mobile phone reads: 'I see easy cash so I run up to him and grab it from his hand'.Police wanted to stress that often thieves look for opportunities, rather than creating devious plans.

Mr Moore is the founding director of Pied a Terre and has appeared on the BBC2 programme 'The Restaurant' as one of the 'Inspectors'.

He opened his award-winning restaurant in 1991 with head chef Richard Neat who earned the restaurant two highly-prized Michelin stars.

Sister restaurant L'Autre Pied opened in late 2007.
