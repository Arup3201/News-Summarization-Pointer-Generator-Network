Little Bobbi Boyden, who is not yet two, has made a name for herself as Baby Beyoncé at beauty pageants across the UK. 

But since making headlines at the weekend, her mother  Stephanie has found herself in the middle of a furious public backlash.

Now, Ms Boyden has hit back at her critics, many of whom described her as 'cruel' to enter her daughter in dance competitions at such a young age, and says their claims are 'absolute nonsense'.

Speaking on ITV's This Morning Ms Boyden, who sat beside pageant director Sara Collins, defended her decision to put her 19-month-old daughter on stage in a curled blonde hair piece and leotard.

Ms Boyden, from Colchester in Essex, told the show that Bobbi loves to dance and her performance in pageants is innocent fun.

'A lot of negativity has come with it,' she said of the backlash, which has seen her receive hate mail from as far afield as the US.

'Originally i just wanted to promote Bobbi as a performing child, as she loves to dance and it has turned into this big pageant argument.'

She also dismissed allegations that having Bobbi perform in such a manner risks her becoming over-sexualised at a very young age.

'I think its a load of nonsense if I'm honest,' she complained. 'It makes no difference to her, if we put music on now she would get up and dance to it.

Her mother Stephanie Boyden (middle), 32, has previously said that Bobbi is a 'diva' who runs to the stage when her name is called - and screams when she has to leave

'She's not wearing a wig today because she didn't want it on. If she really doesn't want the wig on I don't make her wear it. 

Pageant director Sara Collins also stepped in to defend the young dancer, saying: 'They are competitions - in the same way you have dance and swimming competitions. 

'You have winners and you have runners up. We don't have losers in pageants. It is a competition but it's very healthy.'

She continued: 'My daughter Ella was horrifically bullied, as are most of the boys and girls who take part in pageants. 

Stephanie claims that many babies dance to 'Single Ladies' and she didn't teach Bobbi any moves  

'Their self confidence has been battered and that's what happened with my daughter. She decided to take part in pageants and it has literally saved her life.'

However, despite both women insisting that dancing in competitions is what Bobbi loves, the toddler refused to dance when Single Ladies was played in the studio.

Despite its risqué lyrics, Ms Boyden defended the choice of song. 'If you look on YouTube there are lots of babies dancing to that song,' she argued.

'And because of the little dance moves it's easy for her to do. I didn't teach her the moves, I just put the video on the telly.'

Despite admitting her partner Anton, who works in the military, has concerns about Bobbi's performances, Ms Boyden told This Morning that 'if he really thought it would do any harm she wouldn't do it.'

Ms Collins, who has signed Bobbi to  her talent agency, 'Sara's Stars', also reassured viewers that fears of perverts turning up to watch the pageants are unfounded.

Her mother said: 'She loves the attention of being up on stage and she screams to get up there. She's definitely a diva. I have to hold her back'

'They are a ticket only event and only friends and family are allowed in the audience,' she explained.

Despite her reluctance to dance in the studio, Ms Boyden insisted that Bobbi is a 'diva' who runs to the stage when her name is called - and screams when she has to leave.

'Bobbi's like a little Beyonce, a little madam really,' she added. 'She loves the attention of being up on stage and she screams to get up there. She's definitely a diva. I have to hold her back.'
