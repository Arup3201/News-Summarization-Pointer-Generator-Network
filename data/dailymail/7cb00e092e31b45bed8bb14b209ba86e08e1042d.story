The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall ended their four-day tour of Colombia on a wet and windy note as they sheltered under umbrellas in pouring rain.

The royal couple were set to bid farewell to the Latin American country with a sunset ceremony on the deck of a Royal Navy warship that is currently docked at Cartagena harbour.

But last night sweltering temperatures gave wave to a rumbling thunderstorm, forcing guests on board HMS Argyll to take shelter from heavy downpours under a marquee.

Camilla, who was carrying an umbrella, made sure her elegant white dress stayed dry by wearing a beige raincoat draped over her shoulders.  

Prince Charles, who was in Navy dress uniform, was happy to step out into the showers to help his wife on to the Type 23 frigate, where they were greeted by naval officers.

But despite the thundery showers, the couple looked relaxed as they chatted to guests, who included Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and the warship's officers.

The evening ended with the lowering of the Royal Navy Ensign.

It brought to a close their official tour of the country, which is emerging from five decades of civil violence.  

The trip highlighted some of the issues Colombia is working to address from protecting its unique environment, to healing divisions caused by the internal war involving guerrilla forces.

It was also marked by some personal moments for the couple. Earlier this week the Prince spoke of his anguish following the death of his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, while the Duchess made a passionate intervention on the subject of sexual violence.

Earlier in the day, the couple inspected the treasure at the Museo del Oro Zenu in Cartagena, where they were both presented with a traditional black and white sombrero vueltiao hat. 

A huge crowd of people, many of whom carried Union flags, had gathered outside the museum to see the couple arrive, with Prince Charles taking the opportunity to share a joke with some of the locals during a walkabout.

He also tried his hand at playing the drum and appeared to be enjoying himself, even if those listening were less than enamoured with his musical talents.

Following the visit to the museum, the couple continued on to the Naval Academy, where they saw a haul of submarines confiscated from drug gangs and now displayed outside the school.

Dedicated: The Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Charles both carried umbrellas as they left the ceremony. The couple will spend today privately in Cartagena, a city which has a strong Caribbean heritage

Charles and Camilla continued on to a war memorial dedicated to the British soldiers who died during an attempt to take the city's Fort of San Felipe in 1741. 

The couple will spend today privately in Cartagena, a city which has a strong Caribbean heritage and whose old town is a Unesco world heritage site.

The royal couple will arrive in Mexico tomorrow, which is the Day of the Dead, a Mexican public holiday when people gather to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and visit their graves.

The royal couple will mark the day by visiting the Cornish cemetery in Real del Monte, which contains the only known British First World War memorial in Mexico, to a Cornish immigrant who died at the Battle of the Somme. The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall will lay a wreath at the memorial.
