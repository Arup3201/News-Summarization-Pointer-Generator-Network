Found: Hannah Skakle, 15, went missing on Friday from her home in Marlette, Michigan but was located three days later after allegedly going to stay with a 19-year-old friend she met online

The desperate search for a missing girl in small-town Marlette, Michigan has come to a close after the 15-year-old was found 200 miles away in Kalamazoo.

Hannah Skakle disappeared from her home on Friday, December 26, and police at the time speculated that she could have run away to meet someone she connected with online. 

Marlette Police Chief Brian McGinnis believes their initial theories were true, and says she surfaced three days later when her online friend discovered she was both underage and wanted by authorities in her hometown. 

McGinnis says the teen left home around 6:30pm Friday and was taken to Kalamazoo by the online friend, who is allegedly 19 but has not been identified as either male or female.

Skakle spent several days with this friend and even bleached and cut her hair to avoid recognition.

However, McGinnis says on Monday her host read social media posts online showing that she was missing and just 15. 

Skakle's friend allegedly told her she needed to leave the house, and dropped her off at a women's shelter in the city. 

The shelter's staff called police, and she was held by local authorities until her parents were able to pick her up that evening around 7pm.

McGinnis says they are continuing the investigate Skakle's disappearance and so far have not located her online friend. 

Police plan to issue search warrants to comb through the girl's emails, texting apps and other social media accounts for information that might lead them to the friend, who could face charges of accosting a minor.

Skakle is in good health, according to McGinnis, who added that there is no evidence she was sexually assaulted during her three days missing.

McGinnis says Skakle has been evasive with police during questioning, but that she is answering some of the questions. 

She told police that she had been in contact with her friend for about two months using phones she borrowed from her friends at school. When she initially went missing, her parents told authorities they did not believe she had her own phone.

'This was a scary situation for everybody involved. She did not have a phone, she borrowed friends’ phones to access this social media stuff and try to make contact with this person. So, parents just can’t be careful enough,' McGinnis told CBS Detroit. 'This could have had a very bad, tragic ending. We’re glad it didn’t, however it does not stop here. We just need to be more vigilant as parents and as law enforcement as well.' 

The Sanilac County Prosecutor's Office, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the FBI assisted in the investigation.
