Forget dolls and board games, it will be electronic gadgets and iPad-style devices at the top of most youngsters' Christmas lists this year, industry insiders say.

Children as young as three are being targetted with a dizzying array of computerised products as manufacturers hope to cash in on the growing market.

One expected to fly off the shelves is LeapFrog Enterprises LeapPad 2 - an iPad-style tablet that features front-and-back cameras, video 
recorders and 4GB of memory.

Must have gift: The LeapPad2 tablet has topped The Toy Insider list for 2012

It also boasts a music player with five LeapFrog
Learning Songs, Cartoon Director and Art Studio creativity apps and a 
Pet Pad writing app.

The Toy Insider, a holiday gift 
guide, as well as major toy sellers Walmart and Toys R Us, have all 
ranked the LeapPad as this year's top toy.

In 2011, the first edition of the LeapPad sold well.

But this year it looks set to take the gift world by storm with an updated version of the $99.99 tablet sporting a faster processor, twice as much memory and an additional camera.

'It's going to be the war of the 
tablets,' said Laurie Schacht, chief executive and president of 
Adventure Publishing, which issues the Toy Insider Hot 20 list.

'What
the LeapPad 2 has done is it has really positioned itself not to be 
part of that tablet war but to be an item for younger kids that gets 
them ready to move into the older tablets.'

Toy Insider's list, released today, includes the LeapPad 2 in its lineup of toys for three-to-five year olds and the Kurio 7 tablet from Techno Source for children who are 6 to 8 years old.

While the U.S. holiday shopping season 
does not get into full swing until the day after Thanksgiving, such 
lists often come out in September to give gift-givers an early look at 
what children might want.

The new Nintendo games console, the Wii U, which boast a game pad with a touch screen, is expected to be another top seller

The holiday season is a crucial time for retailers and, of course, for toy makers.

In 2011, the fourth quarter accounted for 46 percent of LeapFrog's annual sales.

At large toy makers Mattel Inc and Hasbro Inc, more than 30 percent of annual sales come during the final quarter of the year.
