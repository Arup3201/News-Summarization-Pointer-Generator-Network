Tim Sherwood has told Scott Sinclair and Tom Cleverley they are playing for their futures in Aston Villa’s fight against relegation.

The on-loan duo have contributed significantly to back-to-back wins against West Bromwich Albion and Sherwood wants more of the same at Sunderland on Saturday.

The Villa boss said: ‘They are fighting for their futures, whether at this club or with someone else.’

Sinclair joined on a temporary deal from Manchester City in January with a view to a permanent summer transfer, while Cleverley arrived from rivals United last September. He is out of contract at the end of this campaign.

Sherwood said: ‘Tom Cleverley is a great example. I think he has come in for a little bit of criticism but he is getting appreciated now.’

Sinclair has scored three in four games and has shown glimpses of the player he was before joining City from Swansea in August 2012.

‘He is eager to stay in the summer,’ said Sherwood. ‘It is something that can be discussed once we are safe — in a couple of weeks!’
