The husband of model Katie Cleary who shot himself dead at a shooting range was previously feared to have travelled to another gun club to kill himself, it has been reported.

Andrew Stern's mother called police after the entrepreneur was believed to have attempted to gain entry to the AIMHI Shooting Range in New Albany, Ohio.

The incident took place on April 17, a number of days after he had filed for divorce from Cleary, the New York Daily News has reported.

Stern was previously feared to have threatened suicide at the AIMHI Shooting Range, in New Albany, Ohio, it has been reported

During the call, obtained by The News, Stern's mother says: 'I think my son had gone to the gun place in New Albany (Ohio) to shoot himself... he's threatening suicide.'

His mother was also fearful he may attempt to kill himself through carbon monoxide poisoning.

Police learnt Stern had been sent away from the gun range by staff.

Stern shot himself in the head at the Target Range in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, on Sunday, just weeks after Cleary was pictured with Leonardo DiCaprio.

His funeralÂ  took place yesterday in
 Los Angeles and was attended by wife Katie. His business partner and 
close friend David Abelson spoke.

An
 orthodox rabbi from Columbus, Ohio, the state Stern was from, was 
flown in to officiate the Jewish service held at Sinai Memorial Park, in
 Simi Valley on the outskirts of Los Angeles.

Stern, who appeared on Millionaire Matchmaker, was the one who petitioned for divorce in April

The cemetery said about 50 to 60 people attended, made up of Andrew's friends and family.

On Wednesday, Stern's family issued a statement remembering their beloved son.

The family said: 'Andrew was an adored son, cherished 
friend, successful businessman, adventurous athlete, passionate animal 
rights activist & humanitarian.

'No one is without flaws, but Andrew 
was a giving and generous spirit who touched so many lives in a 
positive way.

'For those of us who loved him, there will never be an 
answer to "why?" We choose to honor his memory by remembering how he 
lived, not how he died.'

Another source, who has known Stern for around 10 years, said the businessman suffered from OCD and depression.

Lost love: Andrew was devastated over the break up of his marriage to Katie. She attended his funeral on Tuesday

The
 source thinks the balance of his medication may have been harmed when 
he came off testosterone and Human Growth Hormone (HGH) a few months 
ago.

The
 source said: 'I think he had OCD and battled with depression. He was on
 medication. I think he's been on medication a long time. He started 
taking testosterone and HGH. I think he was working out a lot, a lot of 
guys take testosterone when they work out but it messes with the balance
 of everything too. He came off it within the last few months but he was
 never irritable around me, he was always cool.

'Then I think when his wife left him it fuelled gasoline to the fire.'

Speaking about his break-up with his wife, the source added Stern was 'heartbroken':

'They have been separated for a few months. I don't know what happened. She was the one that wanted the divorce.

'I just knew her through Andrew. It's hard to tell when you're on the outside when they were last happy.

Getting acquainted: Sources said that Cleary and Stern were going through a divorce, which added to his stress

'I
 think he really was heartbroken, I don't know why she left him but I 
think he wanted to try to figure out how to make it work. He was so 
upset over it, he just could not get over it, he could not mentally move
 on.'

Another
 friend has told MailOnline that he was already on a dark descent when 
he realized he couldn't hold on to his 'dream girl'.

'Andrew
 changed at the beginning of the year,' the source told MailOnline. 'He 
worked more and socialized less. He began investing even more money and 
more time into his charity and fundraising work... He got sad. Sadder.'

The
 friend explained that something was 'broken' in him and no matter how 
he tried to fight it - with eating well, exercise or counseling 
sessions - he couldn't shake it.

His
 struggling marriage to Cleary was not to blame for his apparent suicide but just 
added to his pain because of the fantasy he had about their life 
together, the friend said.

They've met before: Katie and Leo were together at the Santa Barbara Film Festival last February

Cleary's 
father, Thomas, who lives just outside Chicago in Illinois, has told 
MailOnline that his daughter was devastated by her husband's death.

'This
 is a terrible loss for my daughter Katie and obviously she is 
devastated,' he said. 'We are all grieving for her and for my 
son-in-law.'

Mr Stern 
had filed court papers to end the couple's less-than-four-year marriage 
just weeks before the images emerged, according to court documents, and
 Cleary and Stern were still in the process of dividing up their assets when he died.

Stern, who had appeared on 
Bravo's dating show Millionaire Matchmaker, married the model on July 
31, 2010. The court documents state the pair separated on April 3, 2014.

The 
divorce papers read: 'The exact nature and extent of [Stern's] separate 
assets including, without limitation, funds and/or other property 
interests due to [Stern] from [Cleary] by way of recoupment, 
misappropriation... are presently under determination.'

Stunning: The couple became engaged in 2009 and married in California in 2010

Glamorous: Cleary, 32, has worked on Deal or No Deal and has featured in a handful of movies and TV shows

Cleary's rep has told TMZ the
 couple broke up eight months ago and that the pictures of Cleary getting close to DiCaprio and Entourage star Adrian Grenier were harmless.

The rep explained that Cleary and Grenier had been 
friends for sometime, while Cleary and Dicaprico had only 
met the night they were photographed - but the rep insisted they were innocently 
discussing animal conservation and nothing else.

On Tuesday it emerged that two other men had taken their lives at the same shooting range in the past five years.

Katie, who 
is from Glenview, Illinois, appeared on the first series of America's 
Next Top Model while she was still a college student, before landing the
 role of 'briefcase beauty' on popular game show Deal Or No Deal.

She has since had minor roles in The Break Up, Iron Man 2 
and Entourage, while appearing in advertising campaigns for Sketchers, 
Nike and Elastiderm.

Stern had set up his own successful marketing firm after graduating from Miami University in Oxford, 
Ohio and moving to Los Angeles.

Initially
 working for other companies, he started his career with the Los Angeles
 Lakers, Taco Bell, Southwest Airlines and Pepsi, according to an obituary posted on Performance Marketing Insider by a business friend, Pace Lattin.

After
 working with professional athletes including Kobe Bryant and Anna 
Kournikova at Broadband Sports, he joined L90 Worldwide as a sales and 
media planner, it noted.

In 2002, he founded Seed Corn Advertising and went on to produce movies, launch 
restaurants, real estate and 'brokering exotic cars', the obituary said.

He
 also featured on Season 2 of the hit TV show 'Millionaire Matchmaker' 
before marrying Cleary, 'the love of his life', Lattin wrote.

'Andrew kept his original company, never sold out, always was making money and working hard,' he wrote.

'We
 both started in the industry at the same time, and his passing makes me
 extremely sad. We were both young kids in this industry, and grew up 
making money in this industry - and everyone I know did business with 
him at one time or another.'
