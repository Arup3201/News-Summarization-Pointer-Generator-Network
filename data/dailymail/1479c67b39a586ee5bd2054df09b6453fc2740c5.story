Rudy Gestede struck a dramatic late equaliser against his former club to deny Cardiff manager Russell Slade a much-needed victory.

Sean Morrison’s 84th-minute header from a Peter Whittingham corner had put Cardiff on course for a first win in seven games.

But Gestede, sold by Cardiff for £200,000 last year, earned Blackburn a point with his 15th goal of the season in added time.

Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer said: ‘Rudy didn’t play as much as he would have liked when he was here and that goal would have meant a lot to him.’

Slade has come in for fierce criticism, with a supporters’ poll showing that more than 80 per cent felt he was the wrong man for the job.

He said: ‘It is frustrating not to win but that was a much better performance. There are signs of improvement.’
