Holidaymakers travelling to Cyprus faced 'nightmare' flight delays after they were stuck for 18 hours leaving the UK and then another 17 hours coming home.

A Thomas Cook Airlines flight from Larnaca, was due to land at Cardiff airport at 12.30am on Monday, but didn't arrive until 5.45pm, after experiencing a technical fault.

But customers who had spent a week in Cyprus had already lost a night of their break after a bird strike led to their 1.35pm flight from Wales on September 21 delayed until 7am the following day, according to the South Wales Aviation Group site.

Some travellers said the delay had also meant the loss of a day's work.

Mark Archer, 24, from Bridgend, and his partner Sarah Keast, were hit by both delays.

Mr Archer said: 'We're going to Thomas Cook to complain. To have two overnight delays on a week's holiday is ridiculous.

'At least, we want a full refund for the flights and a bit of compensation for the day's earnings lost and our transfers.'

Charmaine Lloyd, 53, and Leanne Lloyd, 42, were put up in a Premier Inn near Barry last week. Charmaine said: 'We've had a lovely holiday but its been a nightmare, worst we've ever known.

'They looked after us in Larnarca but that's besides the point. We should have been home Monday morning.'

Jack Jennings, 19, from Pontypool, who was on holiday in Ayia Napa with a group of friends, said: 'It was a hassle that we didn't need.

'The holiday was brilliant, I give it ten out of ten, but the Monday I would give a two.'

Thomas Cook, which put people up in hotels for each delay,  said: 'We'd like to sincerely apologise to our customers for the delay to their flight from Larnaca to Cardiff, which has been caused by an unexpected technical fault on theaircraft operating the flight.'

He added that the flight that was cancelled the week before was 'affected by a double bird strike on its way into Cardiff to take our customers on holiday and therefore required an inspection of the engines.' 

'We know how frustrating these delays are, and we'd like to thank our customers for their patience and understanding,' he said.
