Arsenal will be without Gabriel for three weeks after the central defender sustained a hamstring injury.

The January signing limped off during Wednesday's win at Queens Park Rangers that kept Arsenal third in the Barclays Premier League.

He will miss Monday's FA Cup clash against Manchester United, the league game against West Ham and Champions League tie versus Monaco. 

Wenger confirmed he will be without Gabriel Paulista for up to three weeks due to a hamstring injury

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger held a press conference on Friday morning ahead of his FA Cup match

'Gabriel has a little hamstring injury and he will be out for two to three weeks,' Wenger said. 'That means he’s not available for the weekend and certainly not for West Ham United or Monaco, but after that he should be available again.

'We will of course lose Gabriel in the squad and Nacho Monreal might come back. He will have a test today. Everybody else should be available - the same squad that played against Queens Park Rangers.' 

Wenger added goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny will also go through a test on Friday and that 'if he gets through that then he will play on Monday night'. 

'Wojciech is used to playing in big games and I think he’ll take that as a big challenge to show his quality. He works very hard in training - I don’t think that will be a problem,' he said.
