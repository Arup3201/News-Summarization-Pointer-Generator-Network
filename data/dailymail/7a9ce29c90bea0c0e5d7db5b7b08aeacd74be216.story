Brave: The 77-year-old woman chased Keith Williams down the stairs and grabbed hold of him after she caught him in her home

A violent burglar was traced with the help of a button that a courageous grandmother tore from his jeans.

The 77-year-old woman chased Keith Williams down the stairs of her suburban Manchester home and grabbed hold of him after she caught him raiding the house.

The thug punched her in the face, but a button fell off his jeans in the struggle before he managed to flee.

Williams, of Manchester, was arrested after fingerprints revealed he had been at the scene of the crime, and the jeans with the missing button were found at the address where he was staying.

The 41-year-old - who has 97 offences stretching back 30 years on his record - was jailed for 32 months at Manchester Crown Court after admitting to the burglary.

The court heard that his last three offences have all involved violent confrontations with women in their seventies.

In the most recent offence, Williams walked through the unlocked door of the victim's home as she put out her recycling bin on the afternoon of September 18.

When she went back into the house, she heard a noise from upstairs, and found Williams standing in the doorway of a bedroom.

He pushed her away when she grabbed him, but the brave pensioner followed him downstairs and took hold of him again.

But Williams managed to escape, fleeing with Â£78 and a locket containing a picture of the victim's grandchildren.

In a statement, the woman, who suffered pain, bruising, anxiety and sleeplessness after her ordeal, told police: 'I feel sick that this has taken place, I'm very angry. The money was to pay for the gas bill, we'd had to save for that.'

When he was charged days after the offence, Williams told officers: 'I'm going to murder the lot of you. I'm going to murder the judges and everyone.'

Andrew Smith said Williams, who shouted denials from the dock during the sentence hearing, was a paranoid schizophrenic, adding that outbursts were a symptom of his condition.

He said that the 41-year-old, who had a history of hard drug abuse, had apologised to the victim for the 'opportunistic' offence, and hoped to better his life with the help of medication and family support.

Sentencing, Judge Michael Henshell said the offence had left the victim 'frightened in her own home'.

Jailing Williams for 32 months, he said: 'It's perfectly obvious you are a person, whatever the state of your mental health, who has a capacity for being violent to people, and you have been violent to elderly people as well.'
