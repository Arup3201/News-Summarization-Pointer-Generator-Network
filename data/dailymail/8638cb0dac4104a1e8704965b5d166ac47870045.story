Sometimes even the fiercest birds of prey need a little rest and relaxation. 

You can find falcons getting that and plenty more at the Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital, the largest of its kind in the world and the leading center for falcon medicine. 

Around 9,000 birds are treated at the hospital, which is located just outside Abu Dhabi, each year. 

Even falcons have to sit in the waiting room. The Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is the largest of its kind in the world and the leading center for falcon medicine

Falcons who visit the hospital can have  X-rays done or get their eyes checked at the ophthalmology department. 

Birds with Avian Flu or Falcon Pox can recover in special quarantined rooms, and there are even two large air conditioned aviaries where falcons can relax as they shed their old feathers and make way for the new - a process known as moulting.

It also has its own breeding center.  

Although it was initially dedicated to treating falcons, the medical center transitioned into an avian hospital for all birds and poultry in 2006, according to its official website. 

The Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital has treated over 67,000 birds since it first opened its doors, and has since become a major tourist attraction in the Abu Dhabi Emirate.

Falcons are a revered bird in the region. 

They feature on the emblem of the United Arab Emirates and falconry is permitted and discussed by the Koran. 

Now considered a national sport and even a rite of passage for young Emirati men, falconry was once traditionally used as a way to obtain food.

It has now been modernized - with some men even using drones to train their birds - as the sport has become more about camaraderie and developing a bond with one's bird. 

The United Nations' UNESCO division recognized falconry in their 'Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity' list in 2012.

Falcons can go for thousands of pounds in the Middle East, and certain types of the bird have become status symbols - selling for more than a million dollars at auction.

Abu Dhabi even hosts a falcon beauty contest every year. 

But the Abu Dhabi Falcon hospital is also working to release certain types of falcons back into their natural wild habitat. 

In 1999 the Abu Dhabi Environment Agency created the Sheikh Zayed Falcon Release program in order to increase the wild falcon population.

Under the directive, the hospital rehabilitates certain types of wild falcons who had previously been used for falconry to follow their natural migratory route.

So far more than 1,3000 falcons have been released back into their original habitats in Pakistan, Iran or Kazakhstan.
