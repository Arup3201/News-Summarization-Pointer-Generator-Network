Cooking on gas: Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw is to receive £4.1million pay for his efforts last year while customers' bills are set to soar

The owners of British Gas last night threatened to increase energy bills by £130 – on the same  day that they approved  multi-million pound pay packages for the firm’s bosses.

The energy giant’s parent company, Centrica, yesterday said rising costs could push the average household ‘dual-fuel tariff’ to a record high of around £1,400.

Despite a shareholders’ revolt at yesterday’s annual meeting, the company still agreed to hand out lavish packages to its executive board.

Some 16 per cent of shareholders 
refused to back the deal, which will see chief executive Sam Laidlaw 
receive pay and perks of £4.1million for last year’s work.

He
 was also awarded shares worth an additional £5.05million which he could
 be entitled to receive in 2014 depending on the company’s performance.

His perks include a £684 discount on his annual energy bill – more than half the amount paid by the average family.

The company last year put up rates by 18 per cent for gas and 16 per cent for electricity for its 15million customers.

Yesterday’s annual meeting was the latest where shareholders hit back against vast executive packages, in what has been dubbed the ‘Shareholder Spring’.

Earlier this week insurance giant Aviva saw its chief executive Andrew Moss resign after shareholders opposed his £5.2million pay.

Double standards: The energy giant's parent company, Centrica, yesterday
 said rising costs could push the average household 'dual-fuel tariff' 
to a record high of around £1,400

His exit followed those of Trinity Mirror Group’s Sly  Bailey and drugs giant AstraZeneca’s David Brennan.

Last night, Centrica said wholesale energy prices for next winter have increased and the trend for tariffs ‘remains upwards.’ It said green taxes will also put up prices.

The firm said: ‘UK wholesale gas costs are around 15 per cent higher for next winter than last, and non-commodity costs ... are expected to add a further £50 to the cost of supplying the average household this year.’

It means that the group will no longer be able to keep rates at current levels – currently £1,232 for the average dual-fuel bill. Analysts suggest this would drive up the annual bill by £130 to £1,362.

Last night consumer groups questioned whether the increases were fair. Audrey Gallacher of Consumer Focus, the official customer body, said: ‘Consumers will need clear evidence that price rises are warranted if they are to stomach further increases to their bills.

‘The perception is that suppliers are quick to pass on high price rises and slow to pass on small price cuts.

'Much greater transparency on costs, pricing and profits is needed for customers to know whether they’re getting a fair deal.

'Wholesale prices go up and down but customers need to know this is accurately reflected in their bill.’

Departing: Earlier this week Aviva's chief executive Andrew Moss resigned after shareholders refused his £5.2m pay demands. His exit comes in the wake of a string of others including Mirror Group's Sly Bailey

Tom Lyon, of energy price comparison site uSwitch.com, described the threat of higher prices as ‘deeply worrying’.

He said: ‘Any further increases will see even more people  seriously struggling to afford their bills.

We would urge all suppliers to hold fire for as long as possible and to ensure  that if they do move it is only in response to a sustained upward trend.

‘It’s also important that they recognise the impact it will have on their customers.’

Yesterday shareholders called on Mr Laidlaw and British Gas managing director Phil Bentley, to quit.

One investor said they should use their perks to pay the company’s £2.5million fine, imposed on British Gas by energy regulator Ofgem for failing customers.

Profits at Centrica last year were just under £2.5billion, with City analysts predicting the figure will surge 20 per cent this year to reach £2.9billion.

Pointing the finger: Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint said those struggling to make ends meet will be astonished that Centrica is now threatening another round of price hikes

British Gas profits are expected to rise from £522million in 2011 to £592million this year.

Mark Todd, of Energy helpline.com, said: ‘Wholesale gas increases of 15 per cent typically translate to bill increases of 10 per cent, so we could expect the average bill to rise by around £80 a year.

‘On top of this, British Gas has also said that other costs have increased by £50 per household. In total, this would translate to a £130 a year or 19 per cent gas price rise.

‘This would take the average   gas and electricity bill to over £1,400 a year, the highest in history and beating the previous record years of 2011 and 2008.’

Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint said: ‘Hard-pressed families and pensioners struggling to make ends meet thanks to the recession made in Downing Street will be astonished that Centrica, who made billions in profits and paid out millions in bonuses last year, are now threatening another round of price hikes.’
