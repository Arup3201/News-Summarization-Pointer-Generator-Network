A four-year-old boy found dead in a Manhattan bathtub on Wednesday suffered excruciating torture at the hands of his babysitter for weeks after his dad left, she allegedly told police.

Myles Dobson was covered with bruises and burns over his arms, legs and genitals when he was found unconscious in Janaie Jones' apartment at the The Ritz Plaza in Midtown.

The 37-year-old told authorities that she was trying to discipline the young boy after she assumed care of the boy on December 18 when his father, Okee Wade, 37, was sent to jail.

'I was giving him corporal punishment,' Jones, a transgender performer who uses the name Kryzie King, allegedly admitted to police, DNAinfo reported. 'I was trying to control him.'
