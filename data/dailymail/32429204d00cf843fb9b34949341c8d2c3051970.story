Usher and his ex-wife appeared make peace in court on Friday after a bitter custody war over their two sons.

The singer gave tearful Tameka Foster Raymond a consoling hug moments after she lost her bid to get temporary primary custody of Usher V, five, and Naviyd, four, in a hearing in Atlanta.

She sought legal action after the pair's older child got caught in a pool drain while in the care of the Grammy winner's aunt on Monday. She alleged the children were in a 'dangerous environment'.

In tears: Usher's ex wife Tameka Foster Raymond broke down during an emergency hearing in Atlanta on Friday. A judge later dismissed her request for temporary custody of the pair's sons

Extending the olive branch: Usher approached his ex-wife after the ruling to give her a hug

But the judge described the incident as an 'awful accident' and dismissed the case.

The
courtroom showdown between the former couple took a surprising turn, 
with Usher extending the proverbial olive branch to a distraught Raymond
by embracing her.

The 34-year-old RnB star tentatively approached, before placing his hand on her shoulder.

Hey,
are you okay? Usher was seen holding his ex-wife by the arms, no doubt 
wanting to show some sign of solidarity following the highly emotional 
week and hearing

Come here: Usher then pulled her to him, although she didn't appear too eager to reciprocate

Best it's going to get: Raymond acquiesced somewhat as she leaned her head on his shoulder

Raymond
- whose 11-year-old son Kile, from a previous relationship, tragically 
died in a jetski accident last year - turned to him as he pulled her in 
for an embrace of apparent sympathy after what has been a very stressful
week for the two parents.

Usher's aunt, Rena Oden, was looking after the children on the day of the pool accident.

Before
dismissing the case, Fulton County Superior Court Judge John Goger said
he wasn't certain anyone really could have done anything to prevent the
accident. But he also advised Usher to keep his ex-wife well advised of
his whereabouts and who's taking care of the children.

Tough time: Raymond grew emotional through much 
of her testimony, especially after listening to the 911 call made by 
Rena after the pool accident

'Awful accident': The judge said he didn't believe another caregiver could have done a better job under the circumstances.

The
pair's boy fell to the bottom of the pool and became stuck in the drain
on Monday, according to an Atlanta police report. A housekeeper tried 
unsuccessfully to free him. A contractor doing work at the home pulled 
the boy from the pool and performed CPR.

The
boy was 'conscious, alert and breathing' when emergency medical workers
arrived, police said. He was still in the hospital Friday.

'They're
just assessing him,' Raymond told reporters outside the courthouse 
after the hearing. 'There is a lot we don't know. I mean you can't - 
it's only been a few days so we're very thankful that he's obviously 
alive but we still have to observe him and make sure that everything is 
OK.'

Taking
to the stand: Raymond requested the hearing earlier this week after the
former couple's five-year-old got caught in a pool drain while in the 
care of the Grammy winner's aunt

Visibly emotional: Raymond said her ex-husband doesn't respond to her calls or emails asking after their childrenÂ 

Shut
out: The caregivers he introduced to me, I didn't know they had quit,' 
she said, referring to her children's previous caretakers. '[Usher] 
doesn't answer the phone, he doesn't answer emails'

Usher left the courthouse in downtown Atlanta without speaking to reporters.

The
filing had said the boy 'suffered a near-death accident' while left 
unsupervised at Usher's home when the singer was out of town.

Contrary
to what Raymond claimed, Usher's aunt was poolside watching the 
children when the older child became stuck in the drain, and Usher was 
at a music studio one highway exit away, said the singer's lawyer John 
Mayoue.

Breaking down: Raymond started sobbing while listening to the 911 call made by Rena after the pool accident

Overcome with emotion: Raymond wailed 'it's chaos, it's chaos' after hearing the 911 call

Rather than being 
grateful that her child had survived, Raymond used the episode to 
revisit the custody battle and gain publicity, Mayoue said.

Raymond,
who is a hair and wardrobe stylist, was emotional during her testimony,
at one point sobbing so hard that she had to step down from the witness
stand to regain her composure.

'He
doesn't confer with me regarding anything,' Raymond said, explaining 
that she never knows where Usher is, where the children are and who's 
taking care of them.

Refutes claims: Usher claimed he sends her a weekly email detailing the children's plans for the upcoming week

Not impressed: Usher looked exasperated prior to the start of the hearing

Usher 
travels frequently and uses caregivers, including his aunt, who aren't 
trained and qualified to care for young children, Raymond said.

'I don't know where my children are, and I don't know who they are with,' said Raymond as she took the stand.

'The
caregivers he introduced to me, I didn't know they had quit,' she said.
'[Usher] doesn't answer the phone, he doesn't answer emails.'

Deep in discussion: Usher was seen going over notes with his lawyer prior to the hearing

Tense moments: The former couple were seen ignoring each other before their lawyers entered the room

Usher
refuted the claims when he took the stand, claiming he sends her a 
weekly email detailing the children's plans for the upcoming week.

'Every
Sunday I send her a weekly activities, any doctor's visits... summer 
camp, any information that's pertinent to their activities,' he said.

'She can contact the children at any moment and any of the people who will be with them at this time.'

Unfit father: Foster's lawyer stated at the start of the hearing that several recent incidents - including the pool accident - prove Usher is an unfit father

Unfounded: Usher's lawyer, meanwhile, asked that the case be dismissed, stating that his sons are 'thriving' under his care

Arriving in court: Usher arriving at an Atlanta court for an emergency custody hearing over the future of his two young sons on Friday

Coger
said he thought Raymond's standards for a caregiver were unusually high
and pointed out that many people leave their children with family 
members.

Raymond's lawyer 
Angela Kinley also attacked Usher for not calling his ex-wife to alert 
her of the accident until about 45 minutes after it happened.

Usher testified that he wanted to try to get information about how serious it was and his son's injuries before calling her.

On
Thursday, Raymond posted a picture of the couple's son in hospital with
the caption, 'My favorite 5 year old. What a blessing!'

No talking: The singer looked solemn as he walked out of the court without talking to reporters

Quick exit: Tameka managed to muster a half smile as she emerged from court flanked by her lawyer

In charge: Usher's aunt, Rena Oden, was looking after the children on the day of the pool accident

'I have always loved and appreciated my sons but tragedies and close calls make this even more evident,' continued the stylist.

Referring
to her late son, she added: 'URV had an angel named Kile Ishmael and 
our Lord and true savior to look after him. Words cannot express the 
relief and how thankful to God I truly am. Thank you Jehovah God, Jesus 
and Kile...also The AV worker that saved my son is my Hero!!! Period.'

She
also wrote earlier in the day: 'Im [sic] very happy this morning, my 
son is resting well... we had a SpongeBob marathon ALLL night, he 
wouldn't go to sleep! Thank u 4 the prayers.'

Usher
and Raymond married in 2007 and divorced two years later. They went 
through a lengthy child custody battle, and Usher last year was awarded 
primary custody of the boys.
