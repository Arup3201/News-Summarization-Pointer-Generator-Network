A frail widow who served her country in the Second World War as a member of the Women's Land Army was left in bed with no food or water for more than three days after her carers failed to turn up.

Beryl Carter, 85, suffers from severe dementia, and depends on carers visiting her home four times a day to get her up, dress her and provide for all her daily needs.

But after an apparent mix-up when a new company took over providing home help for the local council, she was left lying helplessly in her filthy bed for three-and-a-half days until worried neighbours raised the alarm.

By then she was badly distressed, had
lost weight and was suffering from dehydration, and later had to be 
taken to hospital. She may now have to move into a care home.

Yesterday her son – who at the time 
had been preoccupied by his own nine-year-old boy who was in hospital – 
said he was furious that she could have been so badly let down and 
demanded to know what had gone wrong.

The scandal comes just weeks after an
official investigation found that appalling standards of home care 
provided by local councils amounted to a neglect of elderly people's 
basic human rights.

Some are routinely left in bed for 17
hours a day, while many receive such short visits they have to choose 
between being washed or given food, the Equality and Human Rights 
Commission said.

The Daily Mail has highlighted the 
appalling treatment of older people by care workers in their own homes 
as part of its Dignity for the Elderly campaign.

Shocked: Beryl's son Andrew and his partner Debbie Howat said they were outraged by the mistake

Mrs Carter, who was a member of the 
Women's Land Army before travelling the world with her RAF engine fitter
husband Robert, who died in 1992, moved into a bungalow after being 
diagnosed with dementia ten years ago.

Carers visited her home in Audenshaw,
Greater Manchester, four times a day, but she apparently slipped 
through the net when the local council switched service providers.

The old firm, Housing 21, visited Mrs
Carter as normal at about 9pm on July 3 before handing over the 
contract to Care UK at midnight.

However the new agency claims it was 
not notified that the pensioner had been discharged from hospital a week
earlier following a blood transfusion.

They only realised the blunder 
when neighbours raised the alarm at lunchtime on July 7, and a carer was
dispatched, finding her in a distressed state. Her son Andrew, 45, 
said: 'When I got the call, I just felt sick.

'I visit my mum but my nine-year-old 
son had been in hospital at the time and we had taken our eye off the 
ball a bit, but believed mum was being cared for as usual.'

His partner, Debbie Howat, added: 'I was outraged that an old lady could have been treated like that.

'Beryl is only five-and-a-half stone 
and had lost a lot of weight, her catheter had come out and she had been
lying like that for days without even a drink.' Mrs Carter was later 
taken to hospital after her condition deteriorated, and her son believes
she may in future need round-the-clock care.

'We are all human, and I know 
mistakes can happen, but this was a mistake which could have been fatal 
and we don't want it to happen to anyone else,' said Mr Carter, a former
council worker.

Yesterday Housing 21 said it had 
notified Tameside council's social services department that Mrs Carter 
was back home, but Care UK said this information hadn't been passed to 
it when the new contract began.

Last night Lynn Travis, the council's
executive member for adults' services, said: 'An investigation is 
taking place to ascertain the facts concerning the transfer of care 
arrangements specifically relating to this case following the 
retendering of its homecare services.'

Last month's report into home care 
highlighted a series of problems with an overstretched system where some
pensioners see dozens of different carers every fortnight, in many 
cases visiting for just 15 minutes a day.

Beryl Carter is one of Britain's 
quiet heroines - a woman who fought to provide for her country during 
the war, and for her family for the rest of her life.

She
never expected any praise or favours. What she surely could have 
expected in return for a life of service was to be spared the indignity 
of lying in a filthy bed for three-and-a-half days, not knowing whether -
or even if - anyone was coming to help.

Mrs Carter and her twin brother Victor were born in Stoke-on-Trent, the youngest of a large Victorian family.

When war broke out, she took her place in the Women's Land Army - working round the clock.

Following the war, she met her future husband Robert and the pair married on January 22, 1949.

Together they travelled the world as part of Robert's duties as an engine fitter for the RAF.

Son Andrew said: ‘They visited dozens
of countries including Cyprus, Germany and North Africa. She would tell
me stories of going on shopping trips to Tripoli and Beirut with the 
rest of the RAF wives.

‘Even to this day she shakes her shoes to make sure there are no scorpions hiding in them.’

Andrew,
the couple's only child, was born in 1966. He said: ‘My first memories 
are of Germany because even though I was born in England I spent my 
early childhood there until dad left the air force when I was five.’

The family relocated to Tameside, living in Denton on what is now the Crown Point North shopping centre.

Mrs
Carter took several jobs to help provide for the family - including 
working in a factory and as a dinner lady at the nearby Russell Scott 
Primary.

Her
son said: ‘She wasn't afraid of hard work and always managed to get 
herself a job. She worked right up until her retirement in the 1980s.’

Her
husband died in 1992 but Mrs Carter continued to live independently. 
She later moved to a bungalow after being diagnosed with dementia about 
ten years ago.

Andrew
said: ‘The dementia just sneaked up on us. Although she is now 85 and 
battling several health problems, there is no doubt that her spirit 
still shines through.’
