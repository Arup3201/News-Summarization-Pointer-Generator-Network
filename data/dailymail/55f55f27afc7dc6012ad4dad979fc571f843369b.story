Mali has refused to accept the body of terrorist Amedy Coulibaly in a sudden U-turn the day before he was expected to be buried in the soil of his birth country.

The gunman who murdered four hostages in a Kosher delicatessen as well as a policewoman was due to be buried in Bamako today; instead he remains in a fridge in the Forensic Institute in Paris.

Malian authorities have reportedly given no reason for the change of heart, which means Coulibaly is now likely to be buried somewhere in France.

Nowhere to go: The body of French jihadi Amedy Coulibaly has been rejected by his birth country, Mali. Coulibaly killed four customers of a kosher supermarket as well as a policewoman 

'If Mali refuses to bury him on its territory, he will be buried in France,' said government spokesman Stéphane Le Foll this morning, without elaborating.

The 32-year-old small-time dope dealer-cum-terrorist was gunned down by police as they raided the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket in east Paris on January 9, the day police tracked down Charlie Hebdo massacre gunmen Chérif and Saïd Kouachi.

A day earlier he had shot dead a policewoman in the street and critically injured a street sweeper.

The Kouachi brothers, who were Frenchmen of Algerian heritage, were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - Saïd in Rheims and Chérif in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris - last weekend.

Both were interred at night in unmarked graves, as authorities feared their resting places could become places of pilgrimage for extremists.

The brothers were killed in a shoot-out after hiding in an industrial unit, two days after the attack on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which they killed 12 people.

Neither brothers' hometown wanted the terrorists, but were forced to find graves for them by a French law that grants a right to be buried in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed.

French media reports that no request for a grave has been made in Grigny, the impoverished south Paris suburb where Coulibaly grew up and where his mother and sister still live, nor in Viry-Chatillon, where he was registered to vote.

So it seems most likely Coulibaly will be buried in Fontenay-aux-Roses, the Paris suburb where he had rented a safe house.

A spokesman for the town's mayor said: 'If his family decide to bury him here, I don't think we'll be able to avoid it. The law is strict. But we hope he will be buried somewhere else.'
