Manchester United welcome Chelsea to Old Trafford on Sunday in what is Louis van Gaal’s first test against one of last season’s top four.

United have invested heavily over the summer in a bid to bridge that gap but the early signs are that there is still some way to go.

Here, Sportsmail looks at the two squads and brings you our composite XI in a 4-2-3-1 formation…

GOALKEEPER – Thibaut Courtois

The Belgian is already widely considered the division’s best stopper, and this after just eight matches back at Stamford Bridge.

David de Gea, of course, rivals Courtois for that mantle, but it is the Chelsea custodian who gets the nod.

David de Gea is unlucky not to make the side after some wonderful displays for Manchester United

RIGHT BACK – Branislav Ivanovic

The Serb is everything you want in a full back - he is powerful, pacey, combative and classy.

It isn’t really a contest as to whether he or Rafael gets the vote.

CENTRE BACK – John Terry

The Chelsea captain continues to deliver week in, week out.

He may have lost half a yard of pace, but he more than makes allowance with his cunning, leadership and will to win.

Terry is exactly what United need.

John Terry leads from the front for the Blues and he is exactly what United are missing at the back right now

CENTRE BACK – Gary Cahill

He is England’s No 1 centre back and sets the standard to which the likes of Phil Jones and Chris Smalling must strive.

Again, how United could do with him at the back right now.

LEFT BACK – Cesar Azpilicueta

He is simply a very good defender, and had to be to keep Ashley Cole out of the side last season.

Luke Shaw remains unconvincing in United’s colours, while Marcos Rojo has been deployed at centre back.

CENTRAL MIDFIELD – Nemanja Matic

The big Serb is the best at his trade in the Premier League, protecting his back four but also boasting the creativity to spring offensives at the other end.

Daley Blind has some way to go before he is considered in Matic’s class.

CENTRAL MIDFIELD – Cesc Fabregas

Why didn’t United try to sign him? They were crying out for an experienced midfielder of Fabregas’ proven quality.

He is already making a difference at Chelsea.

ATTACKING MIDFIELD – Angel di Maria

At last, a United entry.

In fact, it would be difficult to keep Di Maria out of any side in the world right now.

He has hit the ground sprinting at Old Trafford and, without him, they would be residing a lot lower than sixth in the table.

Angel di Maria is the only United player in the composite XI - but he would get into any side in the world

ATTACKING MIDFIELD – Eden Hazard

The Belgian is fast maturing into the player we all hoped he would be, consistently delivering rather than showing us the odd flash of genius.

He is a joy to watch and makes it all look so effortless.

Hazard makes the side ahead of former team-mate Juan Mata.

ATTACKING MIDFIELD – Oscar

Now this final attacking-midfield berth was the hardest call on the pitch, but it is the much-improved Brazilian who wins his place ahead of Wayne Rooney and Mata.

Oscar is marrying graft to his craft and has won the trust of Jose Mourinho.

STRIKER – Diego Costa

The brutal brilliance of the Spain international has taken Chelsea to another level this season and, should he stay fit, they will win the league.

At United, Robin van Persie is horribly out of form, while Falcao has not adapted in the manner of Costa to the Premier League.
