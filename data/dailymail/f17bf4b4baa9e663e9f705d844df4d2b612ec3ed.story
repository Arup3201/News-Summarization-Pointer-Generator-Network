A teenage girl died after doctors failed to carry out basic checks that may have revealed she was suffering from life-threatening brain damage, an inquest has heard.

Doctors at Basildon Hospital in Essex didn't check if Amie Miller, 15, could open her eyes or examine her pupil size after she was admitted suffering headaches, vomiting and fitting.

But a duty doctor said that the tests, which may have indicated that her condition was deteriorating, weren't carried out because he 'didn't worry too much' about the schoolgirl and believed that she was 'getting better'.

Amie's mother, Sonia, said: 'She wanted to be a paedatrician and she was a promising student so we are sure she would be at university now. We have had to hold it together for our four other children, but we miss her every day.'

Amie, who had just finished her mock GCSE exams, died of a swelling on the brain on November 19 2008, but it has taken experts five years to find out how she died.

Chelmsford Coroner's Court heard that Amie, from Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, had suffered headaches for seven days and was admitted to the hospital's A&E department on November 16 after she began vomiting and fitting.

She was admitted to an adult ward at the hospital because there was a lack of beds at London's paediatric intensive care units and was given a CT scan, sedated and put on a ventilator.

Lawyers for Amie's family claim that doctors failed to properly investigate why scans showed that her brain was swollen.

Instead of carrying out checks on her condition, doctors believed that Amie's condition was stabilising the day after she was admitted to hospital and the court heard that she was largely ignored by consultants.

They decided to send the teenager for a lumbar puncture on November 19 to remove brain fluid from her spine and carry out tests to find out if her condition was caused by bacteria.

But consultant paediatrician Dr Nawf 
Shareif said that the tests should only be carried out if her condition 
stabilised and she responded to neurological tests first - otherwise a 
lumbar puncture could cause more problems by acting as a suction and 
pulling the brain down.

The 
inquest heard however, that tests were not carried out after duty doctor
 Michel Sun Wai was told by a colleague that Amie's condition had 
improved and that scans were normal.

He told the court: 'With hindsight the neurological observations should have been done. It wasn’t done because, to me, I didn’t worry too much about Amie because I believed her to be a young girl getting better.

'I didn’t focus on the neurological observations at all. At that moment in time we were just waiting for the lumbar puncture to take place. I didn’t need to interfere with the plan.'

'I didn’t worry too much about Amie because I believed her to be a young girl getting better.'

Although doctors argued that Amie's 
sedation would have made the tests difficult to carry out and may not 
have shown problems straight away, Dr Sun Wai admitted that they might have helped.

'I am not denying that neurological observations would have helped with Amie’s condition.

'But the handover to me was that the patient was waking up and was getting better.'

Further scans the same day showed mass fluid on the brain and she later died of encephalitis.

Doctors also defended their decision 
to sedate the youngster with propofol - a drug known to cause high 
levels of potassium and abnormal heart rhythms in children - instead of 
the normal morphine.

Dr Sun Wai, said: 'I would do the same again in the same situation.

Amie was kept on an adult ward at the hospital because of a shortage of beds at London's paediatric intensive care units

'When you stop infusing propofol it wears off fairly quickly. I knew she needed to be woken up the next morning.

'We know we shouldn’t use it in very small children on a high dosage for a long time, but Amie was adult size and the amount we were given was very minor.'

The inquest continues today and is expected to conclude tomorrow.
