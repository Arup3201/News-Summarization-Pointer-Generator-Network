Britain's most expensive one-bedroom home has gone on the market for a staggering £1.8 million despite boasting just 726 sq ft of space.

The cosy Mayfair mews house is in a 'descreet' central London address about a minute from where a house 25 times larger sold for almost £50million earlier this year.

It has an open plan kitchen / living room with a balcony measuring 17ft by 14ft on the first floor and a study and guest cloakroom on the ground floor.  

Britain's most expensive one-bedroom home has gone on the market for a staggering £1.8 million despite boasting just 726 sq ft of space 

The cosy Mayfair mews house in Red Lion Yard (centre with black door) is about a minute from where a house 25 times larger sold for almost £50million earlier this year

The bedroom with en-suite bathroom on the top floor of the home in Red Lion Yard is 18ft by 14ft.

The three-storey home is ten times the average price paid for a home in England and Wales and more the price normally paid for a mansion in upmarket Clifton, Bristol.

It is also the most expensive one-bedroom house currently listed on Rightmove.

Susan Cohen, head of sales and lettings at Pastor Real Estate, said: 'This is a unique opportunity to own the smallest mews house currently on the market in Mayfair.

The bedroom with en-suite bathroom on the top floor of the home in Red Lion Yard is 18ft by 14ft

The study and guest cloakroom on the ground floor of the three-storey house measures 17ft by 8ft

'The property has been finished to an excellent standard and is spread over three floors, providing well-proportioned rooms which have been designed to maximise space.

'The freehold property is situated in a charming quiet cobbled street in the heart of Mayfair, making it ideal for those looking for a quirky pied-a-terre.'

The tiny pad is located just behind The Red Lion, a converted pub which was on the market for £25million.

According to LonRes, which tracks the London property market, the smallest mews house ever sold in the area was a two-bed with just 600 sq/ft. It was sold for £490,000 in 2004.

The central London home boasts an open plan kitchen / living room with a balcony measuring 17ft by 14ft

For the same price outside of London the buyer could have anything from a seven-bedroom country manor to an entire terraced street in West Yorkshire.

The freehold for Scandinavia Terrace in Cleckheaton town centre, near Bradford, includes a shop, 24 houses and lapsed planning permission for eight more.

It is on sale for £1.8million and estate agents claim it could reel in £110,000 a year in rent for a canny owner.

Buyers more in search of country luxury could buy Aylesby Hall in Lincolnshire, which is currently on the market for £1.75million.

It has seven bedrooms, 12 acres of walled gardens and parkland and a vintage-style drawing room, home cinema, triple garage, office suite, pond, wood, 'party barn' and five ovens in the kitchen.

Or for £1.85million they could have Perryston House, an eight-bedroom home on Ayrshire's 'golf coast' which has been described as 'one of the finest art deco houses in Scotland' - though admittedly, it's a slightly longer walk to the shops.

The small home is a minute away from this mansion (pictured) on Charles Street which was sold for almost sold for almost £50million earlier this year

The buyer would need to spend a further £20million restoring it and it is believed to be Britain's most expensive fixer-upper
