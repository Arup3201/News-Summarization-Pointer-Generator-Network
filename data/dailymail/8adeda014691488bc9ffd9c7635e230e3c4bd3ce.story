Team news

Queens Park Rangers

Rio Ferdinand is available for QPR's Barclays Premier League clash against Leicester after suspension - but manager Harry Redknapp is unsure of the defender's fitness.

The 36-year-old has been banned for the previous three games and has struggled with a groin problem but his return is timely as Richard Dunne must now sit out one game having collected five yellow cards.

Eduardo Vargas returns to the squad having missed the Newcastle match as his wife gave birth but Adel Taarabt (groin), Sandro and Alejandro Faurlin (both knee) remain sidelined.

Provisional squad: Green, McCarthy, Murphy, Traore, Onuoha, Ferdinand, Caulker, Yun, Hill, Isla, Henry, Barton, Fer, Mutch, Phillips, Kranjcar, Hoilett, Vargas, Zamora, Austin.

Leicester City

Manager Nigel Pearson has virtually a fully-fit Leicester squad to pick from ahead of their trip to QPR.

He is without midfielder Dean Hammond (calf), who is expected to be sidelined for at least two more weeks, and former England defender Matt Upson, who is not match fit having been out since the summer with a foot injury.

The Foxes have not scored in 500 minutes in the Barclays Premier League, slipping into the bottom three as a result, and are winless in their last seven games.

Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Hamer, Morgan, Moore, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Drinkwater, James, King, Cambiasso, Albrighton, Mahrez, Knockaert, Vardy, Ulloa, Nugent, Schlupp, Wood, Powell.
