Pierce, a member of the Ravens when they won the 2012 Super Bowl, failed a field sobriety test and was taken in and released from the station after being cooperative with officers

Baltimore County police told The Baltimore Sun that Pierce, 23, was pulled over for speeding around 2am, and after an officer suspected he had been drinking the footballer was ordered to perform a field sobriety test. 

After failing the test, a cooperative Pierce was taken to the station, processed and later released.

According to TMZ, he told police; 'Do you know what happened the last time a Ravens player got a DUI? I'm getting cut tomorrow, not like you care.'

Pierce, a member of the team when they won the Super Bowl in 2012, has been charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol, driving while impaired by alcohol, exceeding maximum speed, and driving a vehicle in excess of reasonable and prudent speed on highway.

'We are aware of the situation and learning more about it. We take these matters seriously,' said Ravens spokesperson Chad Steele. 

This  just weeks after Hampton, 22, was also arrested and charged with driving under the influence after he was recorded driving 100 mph in a 55-mph zone in North Carolina.

He was booked after recording a 0.10 blood-alcohol level, and later released when he posted a $2,500 bond.

This also comes just weeks after Pierce's Ravens teammate Victor Hampton (above) was also arrested for a DUI, and cut from the team the next day

Tackle Terrence Cody (above) was also arrested this year and indicted on 15 counts of animal cruelty and drug charges by a grand jury

The Ravens released the cornerback the next day.

As for Cody, he was indicted on 15 counts of animal cruelty and drug charges by a grand jury in February following an incident in which his pet alligator allegedly ate his dog.

He was also found to have  marijuana and drug paraphernalia in his home.

The tackle was also dropped from the team prior to his indictement.

Cody claims that his dog died of worms, and not because he was attacked by the alligator, which was illegally owned. 

All this comes after the Ravens had one of their worst year's ever off the field, with star player Ray Rice being caught on video physically abusing his now-wife Janay (above) in a hotel elevator

All this comes after the Ravens had one of their worst year's ever off the field, with star player Ray Rice being caught on video physically abusing his now-wife Janay in a hotel elevator and team coming under fire for their handling of the situation and questioned over how much they knew about the incident before details were leaked to the public. 

He was soon cut from the team, but appealed the decision and ultimately won the right to be reinstated in the NFL.

He then sued the team for the $3.5million he lost in salary, with the two sides settling out of court before a trial could begin.
