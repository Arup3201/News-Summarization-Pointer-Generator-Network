A woman was shot by her ex-boyfriend after he came looking for her while she was working as a parking attendant at a baseball stadium.

Though the woman has not been identified, the shooter's name is Marcus Collins and he proceeded to kill himself after firing several shots at his ex-girlfriend as she approached by foot.

The woman, 41, was hit at least once in the abdomen after she walked up to Collins' silver Cadillac.

Scene: The woman took a golf cart towards Marcus Collin's car before approaching by foot. He then fired several shots at her and then shot and killed himself inside the silver Cadillac

The Kansas City Star reports that she lost her spleen, kidney, and portions of both her liver and pancreas due to the shooting, but she is expected to survive.

However, police have not been able to interview her to learn more about her relationship with Collins due to her injuries.

As the woman was running away, Collins proceeded to shoot and kill himself.

Police told the paper that Collins, who lived in Raytown, Missouri, knew the woman for nearly two decades but they had only recently started dating.

That said, his family had never heard of her, and her family had never met Collins, implying that the relationship was not serious. 

On with the game: The shooting took place Friday afternoon in the Kauffman Stadium (pictured) parking lot just hours before the Kansas City Royals played the Los Angeles Angels

The incident took place at 3.20pm on Friday in a parking lot between Arrowhead Stadium, home to the Kansas City Chiefs football team, and Kauffman Stadium, home to the Kansas City Royals baseball team.

The Royals played the Los Angeles Angels at home just hours later and the shooting did not disrupt the scheduled game.

AOL Sporting News reports that the team issued a statement later that evening saying that they were 'deeply saddened by the tragic events'.
