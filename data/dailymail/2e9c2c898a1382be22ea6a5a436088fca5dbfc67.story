A teenage girl with cancer is being denied life-saving chemotherapy - because she is nine weeks pregnant and the aggressive treatment could kill her unborn child.

A ban on abortion in the Dominican Republic means the girl - who has acute leukaemia - is being prevented from having the treatment because hospital officials say a round of chemotherapy would result in terminating the pregnancy.

Aggressive treatment is needed to save the life of the unnamed 16-year-old, who is being treated at the Semma Hospital in the capital city of Santos Domingo.

However, it is unclear whether the girl's treatment is being withheld because of the law or the doctors' misunderstanding of it.

Confusion over whether chemotherapy could be classed as a termination is thought to be at the root of the delay.

The girl's mother is now appealing to both doctors and the Dominican authorities to make an exception to save her daughter's life, it was reported.

Rosa Hernandez told CNN: 'My daughter's life is first. I know that [abortion] is a sin and 
that it goes against the law ... but my daughter's health is first.'

The case has sparked controversy and has been fiercely debated by government officials and human right groups.

Authorities are currently deciding whether she should be allowed to receive the chemotherapy.

Staff at the hospital are said to be cautious about administering the treatment over fears they could be prosecuted

The case has angered human rights campaigners who say the treatment should have been given to the girl immediately

However women's rights activist Lilliam Fondeur said the delay was 'unacceptable' and that the treatment should have been offered immediately.

She told CNN: 'How can it be possible
that so much time is being wasted? That the treatment hasn't begun yet 
because they're still meeting, trying to decide if she has the right to 
receive the treatment to save her life - that's unacceptable.'

The director of the bioethics council, which rules on the application of the law, claimed the council was leaning toward allowing her to have the chemotherapy.

However, other politicians claimed the debate was 'artificial' because they doctors were unsure about the application of the law.

Pelegrin Castillo, one of those who engineered the section of law behind the abortion ban, said the ban did not prohibit treating the patient with chemotherapy.

However, it does make it illegal for doctors to carry out a termination in order to administer the treatment.

In spite of this doctors are reluctant to treat the girl for fear of prosecution.

In the meantime - amid confusion over the application of the law - a young girl's life hangs in the balance while she waits for a decision to be made.

The case has highlighted a section of the Dominican constitution that prohibits taking the life of another.

Article 37 of the law, which was 
passed in 2009, states that 'the right to life is inviolable from the 
moment of conception and until death'.

As a result, this has been interpreted by Dominican courts as a strict mandate against abortion.

Under the same section of law, 
Article 37 also prohibits the death penalty, which has also been 
abolished in the Dominican Republic.

The issue has sparked debate over the Caribbean country's abortion laws with many saying they need to be scrapped.

Legalising abortion would also eradicate the risk posed to other women seeking out secret and illegal procedures for unwanted pregnancies.
