Despite a close call during her first round against opponent Madison Keys at the Australian Open on Thursday, the world's number one appeared unconcerned as she dealt with a wardrobe malfunction mid-game.

A candid snap of Serena Williams, 33, cutting a tag from her fluorescent Nike tennis dress on the Melbourne courts, revealed a rare moment of calm during the fierce game.

The pressure felt by Williams was depicted later in the match instead, when the American player took a stumble and only just managed to save herself from a nasty fall.

Williams smashed her way through the second round, finishing on top with a final score of 7-6, 6-2 against breakthrough teenager Keys.

It came after Keys saved eight match points and pushed Williams hard in the tie-break, which she won 7-5.

'She pushed me hard the first set and I had to dig deep mentally to get through that,' Williams said in a courtside interview.

'I'm really excited to be in the final again. I didn't come here with that expectation so it's exciting.'

Williams has won the Australian Open on five previous occasions and is bidding for her 19th grand slam

Both players had entered the semi-final with injury and illness concerns, with Keys suffering a recurrence of an adductor injury and Williams battling a cough after a virus swept through the tournament.

Saturday's final will see Williams battle it out with Russia's Maria Sharapova for the top gong, the nineteenth time they have played against each other.

On another windy day, and in another semi-final featuring players from the same country, Sharapova had a more comfortable victory, beating number ten seed Ekaterina Makarova 6-3, 6-2.

If it goes to form in the final then Williams will be the winner, as she has had a hold over the Russian, beating her sixteen times out of eighteen. Infact you need to go back ten years for Sharapova's last win.

While Makarova seemed a bit overwhelmed by the occasion, 19 year-old Keys' performance suggested that she will be around for a long time to come, striking her heavy groundstrokes despite her sore upper left leg.
