Clint Hill's own goal gave Greek side PAOK a deserved win at Loftus Road as Harry Redknapp's final preparations before the new Premier League season ended with an uninspiring defeat.

Substitute Hill turned home a dangerous cross with just over 20 minutes remaining, while new signing Jordon Mutch made his debut for Redknapp's side, playing the full 90 minutes.

Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker promised much for the new season in a five-man defensive line, but question marks still remain over the future of striker Loic Remy, who was not named on the bench for Saturday's game despite taking part in a full training session beforehand.

Redknapp ended pre-season with three wins out of seven going into Saturday's opener at home to Hull City.

His side were disjointed in the opening 45 minutes, failing to register a shot on target despite fielding a strong side for the Greek Superleague runners up.

Joey Barton struck a speculative effort over the bar in the opening minutes after goalkeeper Glykos Panagiotis scuffed his kick, before Mutch's cross-cum-shot flew just wide after muscling his way into the area.

Mutch, making his debut, did just enough to impress a sparse Loftus Road crowd on his debut, the 6ft 2in new signing providing height and strength in midfield and a threat in the penalty area. With seven Premier League goals last term, the £6million capture from Cardiff should be money well spent.

But the home side did anything but impress. A long ball pumped upfield by PAOK was headed clear by Ferdinand but only as far as Robert Mak, who hit wide on the volley.

The visitors should have been one up after 12 minutes, Eyal Golasa seeing his effort blocked by Caulker after Richard Dunne had misjudged a cross.

QPR have a goalscorer in Charlie Austin, in the Championship at least. Time will tell whether he can reproduce that form in the Premier League, but QPR do have a proven hit man in Remy.

The Frenchman, who travelled with Redkapp's side to Ireland a week ago for their pre-season tour, trained on the pitch before Saturday's game despite not being considered fully match fit.

His failed move to Liverpool created another unwanted transfer saga, but QPR will want to concentrate on integrating him back into the fold to partner last season's top scorer Austin.

QPR's No 9 was shy in front of goal despite hitting four in pre-season, opting to make one pass too many before a dire first-half came to a close.

Just after the break, Stefanos Athanasiadis' first-time effort forced a superb save out of Robert Green having been found in yards of space inside the penalty area.

Green then produced another fine stop down low to his right from Mak's effort, before Athanasiadis' rebounded effort hit the post with the goal gaping from three yards.

PAOK continued to dominate the game as substitute Nedum Onuoha made a last-ditch tackle to deny Dimitris Salpingidis in the six-yard box.

And the Greeks deservedly led after 67 minutes. Substitute Facundo Pereyra drove into the box, slid the ball into the danger area for Hill to knock into his own goal.

It took until the 71st minute for QPR to test the opposite goalkeeper; substitute Karl Henry's long-range effort tipped over by Asterios Giakoumis.

From the resulting corner, Austin's header was cleared off the line as QPR sprung to life. However, despite the tight scoreline, QPR were well beaten.
