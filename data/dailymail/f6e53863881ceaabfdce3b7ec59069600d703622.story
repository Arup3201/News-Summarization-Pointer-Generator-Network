Fabio Capello claims 'all referees are against us' after Russia crashed out of the World Cup at the hands of Algeria, and says a laser pointed at Igor Akinfeev blinded the goalkeeper for the equaliser.

Russia knew three points would be enough to make the last 16 but were held to a 1-1 draw in their Group H finale, and ended their World Cup campaign with just two goals and two points.

Capello, a man who knows a thing or two about World Cup disappointments after managing England at the 2010 tournament, feels the referees have been against his team.

'I don't like to speak about referees, but
every time it's against Russia!' he said.

'Today there was another penalty. All the referees
are against us!

'We conceded a goal from a free kick, which was not.

'I
thought the referee had given it our way. The foul by Kozlov was not. On the
other hand, there was a foul on Kokorin

‘Our goalkeeper was affected by a laser 10 seconds before the
goal. He was blinded by a laser, there are photos, films of it.

‘I'm not looking for excuses. I accept defeats.’

And Capello, under contract until 2018, will not quit as boss.

'I will continue to work for the Russian national
team, if they want me to continue,' he said.

'I have done a good job. England went to the
knockout round in 2010 after failing to qualify for Euro 2008.

'Russia qualified
for the World Cup for the first time in 12 years.'

It was Capello's seventh World Cup match as a coach but the £6.6million-a-year manager has staggeringly only ever won once.

Russia took an early lead against Algeria, courtesy of a sixth-minute goal from Aleksandr Kokorin, but Algeria hit back through striker Islam Slimani with half an hour to go.
