Queens Park Rangers have begun preparing for a huge courtroom battle amid fears of a £50m fine next season.

On the eve of their Championship play-off final clash against Derby, it can be revealed the Loftus Road club have started seeking legal advice over their breach of the Football League’s Financial Fair Play regulations.

In March, the club posted a staggering £65.4m loss for the year ending May 2013.

Facing punishment: Tony Fernandes and QPR could be hit with a £50m fine and a transfer embargo

Under the rules, which limit clubs to an £8m loss per season, Rangers will be hit with a transfer embargo should Harry Redknapp's team lose against Steve McClaren’s side at Wembley on Saturday.

But more worryingly, under the same guidelines, Rangers could face a fine of up to £50m even if they are promoted this summer.

The club will not face sanctions for their financial footing during the 2012-13 season - but will for the current campaign.

Rangers do not have to reveal those figures until December - but given they recorded a £65.4m loss, it seems hugely unlikely that they’ll be able to reel in their deficit to the £8m threshold.

And it is understood the club have opened dialogue with their lawyers as they plot a way to fight against the prospect of a financially crippling fine.

Settling it the Wembley way: Harry Redknapp and QPR face Steve McClaren's Derby in the play-off final

Multi-millionaire businessman Tony Fernandes’ arrival at the club in August 2011 heralded a period of heavy spending at Loftus Road.

But the arrival of big money signings such as Loic Remy, Park Ji-sung, Julio Cesar and Junior Hoilett have not resulted in success on the pitch.

And the club’s relegation from the Barclays Premier League last season has left them facing financial meltdown.
