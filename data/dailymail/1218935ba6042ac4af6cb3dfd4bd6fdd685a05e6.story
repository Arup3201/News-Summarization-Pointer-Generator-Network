A gang of conmen who tricked investors into paying £35million for almost worthless plots of land in a 'grotesque, cynical and merciless' fraud have been jailed today for a total of more than 26 years.

Christopher Demetriou, 30, Daniel Webster, 29, Stephen Allan, 30, and Steven Percival, 29, duped more than 400 clients into the swindle by promises of vast profits.

Potential buyers were told the plots 
of land were to be used for the Olympics and were enticed with glossy brochures 
between 2005 and 2010.

But the plots actually turned out to be low-value farm land, in the Green Belt or no had planning permission.

Stephen Allan, pictured right, was instrumental in helping to trick the wife of a cancer sufferer into investing in the fake scheme and was jailed for seven-and-a-half years

The ruthless crooks duped one woman, who husband was diagnosed with cancer, out of more than £600,000 in the 'land banking' scam.

Other victims of the gang, who hid behind false names and front companies, lost their homes and suffered nervous breakdowns.

Judge Martin Beddoe said: 'In short this was a grotesque, cynical and merciless fraud conducted by the greedy who could not have failed to have realised the very great damage they were doing.

'The investors were persuaded by a team of brokers trained in the black art of pressure selling to part with money which in some cases was all they had saved.

'Many, once sucked in to making investments from which they had no return, were then pressured to go on and invest more in the hope something might materialise, trusting the assurances of those they believed to be working in their interests, people who they often came to think of as friend.'

He said the four men had treated investors as 'contemptible prey to be chewed up and contemptibly spat out', adding: 'Many, many people have been ruined or brought very close to ruin by this con'.

Webster was described by Judge Beddoe as a 'callous and greedy' man who attempted to use his 'arrogance and ridiculous self-belief' to convince jurors he was innocent.

He was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail, having pocketed around £260,000 form the fraud.

Allan, who was jailed for seven- and-a-half years, was slammed for the 'fake care and concern' he employed to trick the wife of cancer sufferer David Wright.

Percival, who netted around £207,000, was also jailed for six-and-a-half years.

Judge Beddoe said: 'Like Daniel 
Webster you thought your skills as a conman and the employment of 
crocodile tears might work here before the jury, they did not.'

Demetriou who earlier admitted conspiracy to defraud investors was described as a 'dominant figure' in the fraud.

He was jailed for six years and four 
months after the court heard he set up five companies to launder almost 
£9million of the profits and personally netting around £2million.

He used the pseudonym 'Chris 
Anthony', Webster gave himself the surname 'Legend', and Allan called 
himself George Hackett and even set up a front company Allan and Hackett
Ltd, named after himself and his alter-ego.

Percival named himself after 
Spiderman star Toby Maguire as he gave the aggressive sales pitch to 
lure customers into the web of deceit.

Deception: The conmen inflated the value of the land and convinced their victims to invest using high-pressure sales techniques

'Investors were persuaded to buy the plots by various high-pressure sales techniques, typically by cold-calling,' said prosecutor Andrew Bird.

'They puffed up the value of the plots of land, and making representations that planning permission was being obtained or that a blue-chip purchaser is interesting in purchasing the land.

'Promises were made that the investor could sell the land back to the marketing company.'

One plot in Birling Road, Leybourne, West Malling, Kent, which was bought from Kent County Council for £80,000, was divided into 220 mini plots valued at just £363.63 each.

The con artists then set about selling each plot for £10,000 a piece, promising rich rewards to investors and drawing up a brochure showing a 'wholly unrealistic' housing project.

The scam used front companies including Countrywide Land Holdings Ltd, Countrywide Land, Regional Land, and Plateau Development and Land Ltd, all of which were linked to the same office on the 29th floor of an office block in Canary Wharf.

Cancer sufferer Mr Wright and his wife Sandra-May were among those sucked into the scheme, investing a total of £628,013 in Countrywide Land after being promised hefty profits in return for buying land.

The retired couple from Shoreham-on-Sea, West Sussex, were first approached in March 2005 by Allan posing as George Hackett.

They were persuaded to part with more than £220,000 for plots in Folkestone, Kent, Aylesbury, Berkswell, in Coventry, Hillesden in Milton Keynes, and Marple in Stockport.

'In short 
this was a grotesque, cynical and merciless fraud conducted by the 
greedy who could not have failed to have realised the very great damage 
they were doing.'

                          Judge Martin Beddoe

The couple had received titles for the land but seen no return by November 2007, but were urged to buy more land in Meopham, in Kent.

'They were expecting Countrywide to take steps to get planning permission and for an opportunity to sell at a profit when the land was snapped up by a developer', said Mr Bird.

By March 2009, the Wrights were growing anxious but were met with excuses over the delay and encouraged to invest another £17,500 in the West Malling site.

Percival, as Toby Maguire, then told the couple some of their land was being bought up by an American investor, but another £100,000 was needed to seal the deal.

The conmen strung them along with claims they were 'privileged clients', asking for increasing sums of money to ensure their investment returned a profit, until eventually they refused to pay any more and were told the money could not be returned.

'Mrs Wright felt that they had to keep paying or that they would lose everything', said Mr Bird.

'They had been promised financial returns and got nothing.

'They had been strung along and persuaded to make more and more payments.'

The scam eventually unravelled after probes by police, trading standards, and the Financial Services Authority, as well as 2010 exposes in the Mail on Sunday.

Paperwork showed plots of land in Slough, Sevenoaks, Plymouth, Horsham, Ely, Ascot, and Dover, were used in the scam, all of which were either green belt land or had no planning permission.

Raids of the trio's homes revealed a host of fake passports, paperwork under aliases, and details of their victims.

Percival's home computer had been used to search on Google for 'Countrywide Land Holding Scam' as the net tightened on the gang.

The mastermind is believed to be a man called James Maynard, who is on the run and is thought to have fled the country.

Percival, of Brenchley Close, Chislehurst, Webster, of Southborough Road, and Allan, of Langham Place, both Bromley, Kent, were all found guilty of conspiracy to defraud.

Demetriou, of Cranbourne Gardens, Ilford, Essex, admitted the charge.

False promises: The conmen convinced investors the land was needed as part of plans to build the Olympic Village and Stadium in London among other lies

Landbanking fraud has become increasingly prevalent in recent years.

Companies
divide land into smaller plots and sell it to investors on the basis 
that once it is available for development it will soar in value.

Fraudsters will use high-pressure sales tactics by cold-calling names and numbers from publicly-available shareholder lists.

They can also use email, post, word of mouth or talk at a seminar or exhibition.

In
fact, the land is often in areas of natural beauty, historical interest
or has little chance of being built on and the people behind these 
companies are actually highly-skilled criminals.

The Financial Services Authority estimates landbanking schemes have so far cost UK investors more than £200million.

Although
not all landbanking schemes are a scam, it is often not made clear to 
investors that there are restrictions on the development of the land or 
that it is otherwise protected.

They offer this advice on how to protect yourself:

-
Contact the local council where the land is located and asking them 
whether the land might ever be released for development. Just because 
the person promoting or operating the scheme says it is guaranteed the 
land will be developed does not necessarily mean it will be. 

-
If you have already invested in a scheme and are concerned, stop 
sending money to the firm and individuals involved. If you have given 
them your bank account details, tell your bank immediately.- 
Contact the FSA Consumer Helpline with as much information as you can 
about your investment and the company involved, including their contact 
details and ‘firm reference number’ (FRN).
