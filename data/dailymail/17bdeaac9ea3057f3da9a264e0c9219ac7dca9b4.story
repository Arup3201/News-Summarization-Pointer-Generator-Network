Jeremy Mathieu has quashed rumours that Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi could be on his way to Paris Saint Germain and is adamant the Argentine will stay put at the Nou Camp.

At the turn of the year Messi's future at the Catalan giants was brought into question amid stories he was unhappy under boss Luis Enrique.

However the forward - who is under contract until 2018 - has gone on to score 17 league goals for his club so far in 2015 and his colleague is convinced his heart remains well and truly placed in the Catalan capital.

The prospect of Lionel Messi moving to Paris Saint Germain is 'impossible' according to Jeremy Mathieu

The France international said he cannot imagine Messi playing for any other club than the Catalan giants

'Messi to PSG? Impossible,' Mathieu told RMC. 'I can't see Messi at any other club than Barcelona.' 

Barcelona are set to come face to face with Ligue 1 champions PSG in the Champions League quarter-finals next month.

The La Liga leaders met with Laurent Blanc's men in the group stages and were beaten 3-2 at the Parc des Princes before winning the return clash 3-1 at the Nou Camp. However the former Valencia centre back is confident his team can get through to the last four of Europe's elite competition.

'It's a game like all others but it will very difficult because PSG have many qualities and great players too,' Mathieu said.

'We know them well and if we play as we did in the two games in the group stage, we'll go through. But we'll have to be at 100 per cent.'

Messi and his Barcelona team-mates celebrate their victory over Real Madrid at the Nou Camp on Sunday

Mathieu was the surprise opening goalscorer in Sunday's El Clasico showdown, which his side emerged 2-1 victors over old rivals Real Madrid, and he believes the La Liga title is theirs to lose after the dramatic win that saw them move four points clear of Los Blancos at the top of the table.  

'There are a lot of games to go and a lot of points left to play for,' he added.

'It is an advantage to have our destiny in our own hands but we'll have to win all of our games. It will be tough. Our April will be busy.'
