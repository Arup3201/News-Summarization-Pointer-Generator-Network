A church Dean has resigned after becoming embroiled in a row with her choir over a paltry payment for their appearance on the BBC’s Songs of Praise.

Janet Henderson, 55, fell out with the singers just two months after she was made the first woman Dean of Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff.

Choristers were angry after being booked to appear on Songs of Praise for an ‘insulting’ fee, but Dean Henderson said appearing on the ‘low-budget’ Sunday evening show was an ‘honour’ which should not be done for personal gain. She has since resigned from her role at the cathedral.

Resignation: Janet Henderson has stepped down just two months after being appointed the first woman Dean of Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff

The Llandaff Cathedral Choir is the 
only professional Anglican cathedral choir in Wales, and has toured 
Europe, with its members receiving a monthly salary from the Llandaff 
diocese for singing at six services a week.

The agreed rate for a day of singing 
is £214 but choristers were offered just £110 each to perform for two 
days for Songs of Praise.

Some choir members were furious after 
discovering the BBC is paying an independent production company £180,000
for three editions of Songs of Praise from Llandaff.

When the fees were revealed last 
month, chorister Adam Poole said: ‘The fee offered to members of the 
choir for singing in these programmes is £110 – considerably less than 
the rate agreed between the BBC and my union Equity.

‘It seems to me there is an attempt to
deprive choir members of the fees they are entitled to.’ Fellow singer 
Matthew Mudge, who has 17 years of choir experience, said: ‘The BBC TV 
agreement with Equity says choir members should be paid £214 for a daily
session of up to five hours.

‘But the recording is taking place over two days so people should be paid two daily fees.’

He added: ‘I think it’s pretty insulting to expect members of the choir to sing for less money than they are entitled to.

‘I can’t imagine them expecting the choir of St Paul’s Cathedral in London to perform cut-price.’

Dean Henderson responded to the 
disquiet in April: ‘It is a privilege for Llandaff Cathedral as it 
allows us to share our worship with millions of viewers across the UK 
and beyond.

‘It’s a low-budget programme and we are not taking part in order to profit financially.’

Dean Henderson was not at any of the seven services held at the cathedral last Sunday.

A spokesman said she had been given 
compassionate leave after a member of her family had been taken ill, but
24 hours later it was confirmed that she had resigned.

Dean Henderson, a former nurse who was ordained more than 20 years ago, was not available for comment yesterday.

She was Archdeacon of Richmond in North Yorkshire before taking up her appointment as Dean of Llandaff in March. She became the first female Dean of Llandaff and only the second female dean ever in Wales.

She said at the time: 'I am thrilled 
and humbled to have been appointed as the next Dean of Llandaff 
Cathedral and Vicar of the parish.

'I'm
looking forward to meeting everyone and working with the Cathedral to 
continue to develop worship and address the pressing fabric and 
financial challenges that face every cathedral community today.'

A source at the cathedral said: ‘The 
Dean has been affected by the opposition she has had from some clergy 
who object to the fact a woman was appointed.’

The source added: ‘The fees row relating to Songs of Praise may have been the last straw.’

The Archbishop of Wales Barry Morgan has
appointed the Venerable Peggy Jackson 'to have necessary oversight of 
the Cathedral' until a new Dean is appointed, the Church in Wales has 
said.
