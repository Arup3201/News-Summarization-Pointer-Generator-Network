When it comes to sibling rivalry, sometimes you have to play dirty in order to stop your brothers getting their hands on your stuff.

A fact quickly discovered by one fox cub after he stumbled across a hidden stash of food while out with his siblings in Germany.

The discovery immediately sparked a ruckus between the family group, as the strongest and most aggressive animal would get the largest share of the spoils.

The trio fought for five minutes to establish who would get the biggest share of the spoils

The ruckus was caught on camera by British photographer Duncan Usher, 59, who hid under a camouflage net

British photographer Duncan Usher, 59, managed to capture the stunning photographs.

He managed to fool the young foxes by ducking into the undergrowth, hidden by a camouflage net.

The red fox is a member of a canidae family which dogs and wolves, but unlike its canine counterparts the fox is not usually a pack animal.

In for the kill: scrapping foxes show off their animal instincts as they squabble over their dinner

Instead foxes either live and hunt alone, or in small family groups, such as the three cubs.

Foxes
 are omnivores, meaning they can eat both vegetables and meat, and 
usually prey on small mammals, rodents and amphibians as well as 
berries, fruit and eggs.

They
 rely largely on scavenged food, but can also hunt, taking down fresh 
prey with a pouncing motion which they practice from an early age.

Adult foxes hunt fresh prey using a pouncing action which they learn and practice at a young age

European red foxes are by far the most common type of fox and fee on small animals and berries

Unlike dogs and wolves, to which they are related, foxes are not pack animals and live in small family groups

Foxes are omnivorous, meaning they can eat both meat and vegetation, meaning they are very adaptable

Once the fight was over the three brothers tucked into the food, and none of them was seriously hurt
