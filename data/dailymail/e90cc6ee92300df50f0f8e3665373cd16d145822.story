Big move: Lauren Bush Lauren and her husband David have been revealed as the buyers of Annie Leibovitz's cut-price New York City home

Lauren Bush Lauren and her husband David have been revealed to be the buyers of Annie Leibovitz's cut-price New York City home.

The celebrated photographer put her 10,200-square-foot, seven-bedroom, 13-fireplace abode on the market in December 2012 for a cool $33million but was forced to reduce the price to $28.5million after no buyers came forward.

It was listed as 'sold' last month, and now the New York Post reports that Lauren Bush Lauren, the niece of former President George W. Bush, and her spouse, David Lauren, the son of fashion mogul Ralph, are the purchasers.

The couple, who married in the fall of 2011, live just a stone's throw away from the massive West Village townhouse, making the moving process a little easier.

Their new marital home, located at 755 Greenwich Street, consists of three separate townhouses which Ms Leibovitz bought for $6.1million and gut-renovated.

She used one for living, one for office space and one as guest quarters.

The red brick buildings, which Ms Leibovitz began assembling in 2002, date back to the 1830s, and are surrounded by a slate patio and private courtyard garden.

Inside the main home, a key feature is Ms Leibovitz's wide-plank wood floors, which are offset by high ceilings. There is also a formal dining room and chef's kitchen.

The building that includes a photography studio also features a large reception room.

Photographers lair: Ms Leibovitz was forced to cut the price of her West Village home, which she lived in for a decade, by $4million to $29million after no buyers came forward

Listing
 broker Paula Del Nunzio, of Brown Harris Stevens, previously said of 
the property: 'It's very rare to have something like this. She created 
it.'

She revealed that Ms Leibovitz was selling up because she wanted to move uptown to be closer to the school of her three daughters - Sarah, who was born in 2001, and her twin girls, Susan and Samuelle, who were born to a surrogate mother in 2005.

Greek Revival style: The brick buildings date back to the 1830s, and include 13 fireplaces in all, with a combined total of more than 10,200 square feet

Labor of love: Ms Leibovitz, 63, created the compound after she purchased all three buildings on the corner of Greenwich Street in Manhattan for $6.1million, and gut-renovated all three homes

Although many speculated that the famed snapper was looking to satisfy her debt problems.

In 2009 she was sued over a dispute over the terms of a loan repayment that involved her townhouses and photo archives, which creditors claimed she had put up as collateral, and saw her narrowly miss having to file for bankruptcy.

She had borrowed $15.5million after experiencing financial challenges due to the then recent loss of her father, her mother, and her long-time partner, Susan Sontag, as well as the addition of twins to her family, and the controversial renovation of the three West Village properties.

At the time, The New York Times noted 
'one of the world’s most successful photographers essentially pawned 
every snap of the shutter she had made or will make until the loans are 
paid off.'

Icon: Ms Leibovitz is best known for her portraits of celebrities such as a Nicole Kidman, Brad Pitt, a pregnant Demi Moore

A breach of contract lawsuit against Ms Leibovitz was filed by Art Capital Group for $24 million regarding the repayment of her loans.

However Art Capital Group withdrew its lawsuit against Ms Leibovitz a few months later in 2009 and extended the due date for repayment of the $24 million loan.

Under the agreement, Ms Leibovitz 
continues to retain control over her work, and is still the 'exclusive 
agent in the sale of her real property (land) and copyrights.'

The sale of her home will likely cover a majority of what she still must repay.

'It’s a big step on her road to financial recovery,' a source said. 'She waited long enough and made a really good deal.'

Lauren Bush Lauren's mother, Sharon Smith Bush, a broker at the property management compant Corcoran, apparently helped represent her during the home buying process.

The 29-year-old model and designer does not have any children with her husband - 13 years her senior - but their spacious new home would be the perfect place to start a family.
