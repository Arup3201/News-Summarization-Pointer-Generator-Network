It was so bleak it turned viewers off and was even dubbed a ‘rural EastEnders’.

But those who tune in for the second series of The Village will be met with a far lighter tone and scenes of cocktail parties, outdoor sports and weddings.

Series two, which begins next month, leaves the grim reality of World War I and moves into the roaring twenties where jazz and motor cars are making an appearance.

There’s Harriet Kilmartin, played by Lucy Brown, behind the wheel in her leathers – a certain sign of changing times, for cars were a rarity back then and a female driver was almost unheard of.

She is among the new characters for the second series, so too is a boxer named Ghana Jones – the first black character to appear.

Then there’s Bert Middleton played by Tom Varey, whose family is at the centre of the period drama, laughing as his friends hoist him on their shoulders.

And even stoic old John Middleton, the abusive drunk played by John Simms who beat his wife and sons, demonstrates a softer side as he gives a new-born calf mouth-to-mouth and tells Grace Middleton, played by Maxine Peake, ‘I love you’.

Mr Middleton is now a dairy farmer, helped by his youngest – and only surviving – son, Bert, and while life remains hard it seems smiles are the order of the day.

The bleak atmosphere of the first series was blamed in part on a particularly harsh winter experienced in the Peak District where the drama is filmed. But the second series saw much calmer weather as it was shot in the spring and summer.

And it certainly makes for lighter viewing than series one, which was criticised for being too miserable and mocking ‘the Grim North’.

Last year, episode one attracted 8.17 million viewers. But by the sixth and final instalment interest had dwindled and just 5.48 million tuned in to watch.

Scenes of grief, depression and violence and themes of alcoholism and canings in school amounted to a ‘miseryfest’ according to many commenting online.

Taking to social networking site Twitter at the time one wrote: ‘The Village is depressing viewing for a Sunday evening. Not sure if I’ll tackle the next episode. It’ll all end in tears.’

Another posted: ‘Don’t think I can watch any more of The Village - want to end the week on a high not a low.’

And it seems the BBC has taken their comments on board.

Highlights from the first episode of season two will include a jovial ‘man hunt’ in which Lord Kilmartin, played by Julian Sands, and his peers chase Bert Middleton over fields and through cobbled streets, offering him a prize of £5 if he can escape.

And there is a boxing match in which men try to survive a round in the ring against boxer Ghana Jones, played by Daniel Ezra.

Meanwhile the wealthy Allinghams, whose family represent the aristocracy, have moved to a grander house and episode one sees Edmund Allingham hosting a party for Lord Kilmartin, his political sponsor.

Later on in the series viewers can expect to see some weddings. And gaggles of friends sharing beers and jokes in the local pub are not an uncommon sight.

The Village is set in an unnamed Derbyshire village and was filmed in locations around the Peak District. Episodes are told through the eyes of Bert Middleton aged 100, looking back on his life. Speaking ahead of the series launch, writer Peter Moffat praised the rural landscape.

He said: ‘The heartbreakingly beautiful countryside is the twenty ninth character in The Village and arguably it’s the biggest role.

‘The more time I spend up in Edale and around Hayfield and Glossop the more I love this rugged, beautiful, honest part of England and the more I understand how passionately people felt about it then and how much they care about it now.’

The Village is expected to be scheduled in a prime time Sunday night slot on BBC1. It will for six episodes, starting in August.
