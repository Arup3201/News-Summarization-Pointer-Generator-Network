The Take Me Out scandal continued today with fresh revelations that 90 revellers enjoyed a two night sex and alcohol party at a £4.5million mansion, causing thousands of pounds of damage.

The 48-hour long event attended by dozens of Take Me Out party-goers took place at the mansion in Chepstow, South Wales and was organised by one of the contestants.

Photos of the night were posted on Facebook and sources said there was 'lots of 's******g' while another said there was 'two or three thousand pounds worth of damage' to the grade II listed building.

It follows revelations yesterday that Take Me Out contestant Aaron Withers, who featured on last Saturday's show, is a £50-an-hour male escort and also has a conviction for punching a woman.

He won a date with contestant Wen-Jing Mo, 28, and the pair went on a romantic holiday to Cyprus.

But today she told the Daily Mirror he failed to reveal his past to her and 'manipulated' her into bed. 

She said she was 'shocked' after discovering the 32-year-old had a criminal conviction, telling the newspaper: 'I have been domestically abused before - when I was 17 - and now my face has a permanent scar from it, a deep scar.

'I would definitely not have slept with him if I had known he had punched a woman'.

In the ITV dating show, hosted by matchmaker Paddy McGuinness, four men try to impress 30 single women from across the UK to get themselves a date.

Contestant Wen-Jing Mo said she is angry Aaron Withers did not reveal his past to her before she slept with him.

She said she was 'manipulated' into bed and said she would not have slept with him if she had known about his criminal conviction for hitting a woman.

She won a date with the 32-year-old following last Saturday's show and the pair went to Cyprus for their romantic getaway.

Wen said: 'I'm shocked. There is definitely no way that if I knew a guy had hit a woman that I would have slept with him'.

She said she had been 'domestically abused' when she was 17 for about three months and has a permanent scar from the attack

Mr Withers did not tell producers of the show about the conviction or the fact he is a male escort.

Wen claimed Mr Withers told her about the fight but did not reveal one of the victims was a woman.

She also said he was texting another girl while they were away.

ITV said it will not show footage next week of the date where Wen said she agreed to the date after leaving her light on by accident.

But if the girls are not interested, they turn out their lights, which has led to the show coining the phrase 'no likey, no lighty'.

A source told The Sun of the party at Wyelands House, held to celebrate the new series: 'There was loads of sex going on - people were doing it in front of each other.'

Another spoke of one girl who had sex with three men and 'canoodled' with nine others while another reveller told how there were 'condoms everywhere'.

Party-goers had apparently been playing a 'lock and key' game where girls are given a padlock and the men a key. The game involves those playing circulating until a match is found.

ITV said it was 'relaxed' about the event.

Revellers
 are believed to have spent £3,000 on alcohol. As they left doors
 were found off their hinges, smashed bottles and glasses were 
discovered and carpets were ruined by spillages.

Wyelands House, owned by developer Paul Bailey and available for rent, has 
ornate ceiling cornices, sash windows, marble fireplaces and flagstone 
floors, according to its website.

The property also has an outdoor pool, giant TV and games room and playground.

Mr Bailey's daughter said revellers showed disrespect but said she wouldn't be pursuing it.

Yesterday it was discovered that Take Me Out contestant Mr Withers is signed up to the Platinum Select escorts website.

On
 his profile page on the site, which advertises the services of more 
than  5,000 escorts, Withers states his charges as £50 for an hour, £500
 for an overnight visit or £1,500 for the whole weekend.

His profile states that he is happy 
to entertain 'mature clients', adding: 'I have an awesome personality 
and will never struggle to hold conversation.'

Referring to his other job, tarmac 
worker Withers told the Daily Mirror: 'It seemed like easy money to fund
 surf trips when I first came to London, just a bit of fun.

'I was really skint and needed to earn cash.'

However,
 Withers insisted that he never offered any more than an escort service,
 unlike many of his competitors who provide 'X-rated extras'.

He added to the paper: 'I certainly didn't offer any more than that.'

Withers
 was convicted of hitting Amy Kerr and her boyfriend Simon Edwards with a
 pool cue during a brawl in a pub in Somerset last summer.

He was fined £200 and told to pay both victims £50 compensation each after pleading guilty to the attack.

An
 ITV spokesperson said Withers' background should have been checked more
 thoroughly by the Take Me Out production company TalkbackThames.

They
 said: 'We are disappointed his record was not picked up in background 
checks carried out by talkbackThames, the producers or Take Me Out.'

TalkbackThames
 said they are now 'reviewing procedures', saying: 'During the 
application process we ask contestants to declare any convictions, and 
background checks are carried out on each individual, in line with 
industry practice.

'Aaron's criminal record did not come to light.'
