Top of the league: House prices in Cobham, Surrey, home to Chelsea defender John Terry and wife Toni, have risen by an average of £647,000 since 1995

The commuter belt favourite of footballers and their wives has enjoyed Britain's biggest property price increases over the past 20 years, a new study has found.

Since 1995, house prices in Cobham, Surrey, home to the likes of John and Toni Terry, have increased by an average £647,000 - more than in any other part of the country.

Earlier this year it was reported that the Chelsea defender netted £16million for his dream home in the leafy enclave, having sold another house - built next door to the property - for £5.25million, making a total profit of £12million.

And the star is not alone, as a Sunday Times analysis of all 19.1million home sales carried out since 1995 found Cobham, where where the Chelsea training ground is based, topped the league for the greatest price increases.

Often dubbed the Beverley Hills of Britain, Cobham and neighbouring Oxshott are also home to Jamie and Louise Redknapp, Jenson Button, Colin Montgomerie, Westlife singer Shane Filan and Andy Murray, while residents pay more income tax than any other area of the UK.

Like Terry, who built his nine-bedroom second home on the site of an older house, many newly-built mansions have taken the place of older homes - often built in the 1930s when Cobham started to attract commuters.

'We've seen properties built for just the land they're standing on and then demolished and a much bigger home built in their place,' estate agent Tony Webb, who works in the area, told the Sunday Times. 

Other Surrey idylls also experienced huge price increases in the last 20 years, with homes in East Molesey - where Manchester United's new left back Luke Shaw grew up, rising by an average of £588,000 and taking second place on the list.

Tucked between the two, Esher was fourth in the table, with values soaring by £530,000. Celebrities including Gary Lineker and Chris Tarrant both have homes in the area.

In Virginia Water, homes have shot up by £466,000, while in Betchworth the figure is £431,000. 

Home counties: All but one of the areas seeing the biggest increase in the value of homes are close to London

Value: Chelsea defender Terry reportedly netted £16million for his dream home in the leafy enclave, having sold another house - built next door to the property - for £5.25million, making a total profit of £12million.

Outside of Surrey, homes in Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire are now £550,000 more expensive than a decade ago, and in Keston in Bromley buyers can expect to pay an extra £500,000.

All but one of the top ten are in the stockbroker-belt surrounding London, with Radlett and Harpenden in Hertfordshire also experiencing booming prices.

Both areas are popular with Arsenal stars, past and present, such as Jack Wilshere, Lee Dixon and assistant manager Steve Bould, no doubt due to their proximity to the Gunners' training ground at London Colney.

Lucian Cook, of estate agency Savils, said: 'The figures show the extent to which the prime towns and super suburbs in a halo around London have become wealth magnets, often developing their own micro-markets.'

In Salcombe, Devon, prices have risen by an average of £446,000. 

The town, nicknamed Chelsea-on-Sea, has the highest number of £1million pound properties outside of London and Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry, Sir Michael Parkinson and rugby World Cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodward all have homes there. 

When adjusted for inflation, homes across the country have risen in value by an average of £135,000.

Perhaps surprisingly, London was only ranked 15th with prices rising by an average of £402,000 - but this could be down to the fact that many of the most expensive properties in the capital are bought through companies and not recorded by the Land Registry as residential sales.

The Chelsea effect: How sleepy Surrey became transformed into Britain's Beverley Hills, thanks to footballers and their WAGS

Not only did Roman Abramovich and Jose Mourinho transform the fortunes of Chelsea, they also turned the area around the Premier League club's training ground into the most exclusive in Britain.

The gated mansions close to the west London club's Cobham base had been known as the ‘gin and Jag’ belt of Surrey but was transformed to the 'Beverley Hills of Britain' eight years ago.

Traditionally it had been an area that attracted the UK's richest bankers, business people and celebrities, but footballers flocked from Chelsea, Kensington and other parts of London to leafy Surrey villages. 

Top draw: The Chelsea training ground at Stoke d'Abernon, near Cobham

John Terry and his Chelsea team mates began decamping to the area in 2005 after Chelsea's training ground moved to Stoke d'Abernon, near Cobham, after the then manager Jose Mourinho, now in his second spell at the club, decreed they should all live within minutes of it.

The Special One himself also bought a grand home in the area, where a mansion costs an average of £4.5million, around £200,000 more than a year ago.

His captain led the way and then team mates like Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, and Fernando Torres bought mansions for themselves and their WAGS.

Terry fell out with Oxshott near-neighbour and once close friend Wayne Bridge, after an alleged affair with French underwear model Vanessa Perroncel, Bridge's then girlfriend. Terry was sacked as England captain.

Pricey: Residents in the borough of Elmbridge, inclduing Cobham and Esher, pay more income tax than any other area of the UK

Oxshott is reputedly the most expensive village in Britain. Like Cobham it is in the district council area of Elmbridge, which also includes ­Claygate, Esher and Weybridge, each a couple of miles apart.

The leafy idyll is home to Elton John, Gary Lineker, Jenson Button and Andy Murray, and residents pay more income tax than any other area of the UK.

The tax man receives £1.2billon a year from residents of Elmbridge, twice the amount drawn from Cardiff and Newcastle combined, and 200 times more than from Google.

The footballers' needs, and those of their wives and girlfriends, are well catered for in the area - even the corner shops stock Dom Perignon and Krug champagne while traditional shops have been replaced with hair salons.

The neo-classical houses on the Crown Estate in Oxshott are a favourite with the players.

Each property is built on half-acre or so, separated from the others by red-brick walls and swathes of evergreen foliage.
