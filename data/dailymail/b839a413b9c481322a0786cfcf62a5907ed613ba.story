While gay rights activists are lauding the President's public show of support for same-sex marriages, it has drawn and surprising apology and counter-intuitive criticism from some high-profile figures.

Vice President Joe Biden reportedly met with Mr Obama in the Oval Office on Wednesday to apologize for essentially forcing the President's hand on the issue after he made his own demonstration of support earlier than the commander-in-chief.

The same day, Mr Obama was the target of Republican ire for the move, including one such blast from the Bristol Palin.

While her criticism is expected as she is the daughter of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, it was seemingly hypocritical for her to promote the need of fathers and mothers in children’s lives while she herself is raising her own son on her own and forbidding his father from seeing their child.

Apology: Vice President Joe Biden met with Mr Obama on Wednesday to apologize for 'forcing his hand' on the same-sex marriage debate and turning it into a campaign issue before the White House wanted it to be

The meeting with Mr Biden was seen as an attempt to smooth tensions that were raised between the President and his Vice President after he spoke out on gay marriage without White House consent, leaving Obama aides deeply frustrated.

Mr Biden's comments pushed gay marriage to the forefront of the presidential race and focused a fresh spotlight on Obama's vague position on the matter.

The president, who once opposed gay marriage, had been saying for more than a year that his personal views were 'evolving.'

In an interview with ABC News, Obama said he wasn't angry at Biden, though he thought the vice president had gotten 'a little bit over his skis' by voicing his support for gay marriage ahead of his boss.

'Would I have preferred to have done this in my own way, in my own terms, without I think, there being a lot of notice to everybody? Sure,' Obama said. 'But all's well that ends well.'

Change of heart: President Barack Obama said he once thought civil unions were sufficient rights for gay couples, but he no longer believes that

The White House and Obama's presidential campaign at first tried to play down Biden's remarks, insisting that the vice president had gone no further in support of equal rights for same-sex couples.

But gay rights advocates latched onto Biden's remarks, which occurred on Friday during a taping of an interview that aired on Sunday, declaring him the highest-ranking U.S. official to support gay marriage.

By Tuesday morning, the president came to the conclusion that he couldn't stay silent on the issue any further.

The White House hastily arranged a television interview with ABC News for Wednesday, during which Obama explained to the public that he had decided it was important for him to 'affirm that same-sex couples should be able to get married.'

In response, Bristol Palin took to her blog to lambast the move, claiming that a child needs a mother and father - even though she is a single mother.

'We know that in general kids do better growing up in a mother/father home,' the daughter of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin wrote on her blog. 'Ideally, fathers help shape their kids’ worldview.'

Despite this lecture, she has largely raised her three-year-old son Tripp on her own, after splitting with his father Levi Johnston three months after the birth.

Criticism: Bristol Palin has criticsed Obama for supporting gay marriage, saying a child needs a mother and a father. She split with Levi Johnston, right, the father of her son Tripp, left, three months after he was born

'He’s seen Tripp twice in the past four months,' she told In Touch magazine in a recent interview. 'He once went an entire year without seeing him at all.'

It comes a day after the president endorsed same-sex marriage in an interview with ABC News.

Many deemed the move as a political calculation for his re-election campaign as it draws a clear distinction between himself and Republican Mitt Romney, who opposes gay marriage.

'At a certain point I’ve just 
concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and 
affirm that I think same sex couples should be able to get married,' the
president said.

Obama said his daughters and their friends were a major reason he changed his mind about gay marriage - a factor that Bristol Palin ridiculed in her blog.

'Malia and Sasha, they have
friends whose parents are same-sex couples,' he said on Wednesday.

Historic: President Barack Obama is the first sitting US President to publicly support gay marriage. President George W Bush opposed it and President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage act into law

'There have been times where
Michelle and I have been sitting around the dinner table and we’re 
talking about their friends and their parents and Malia and Sasha, it 
wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be 
treated differently.

'It doesn’t make sense to them and frankly, that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective.'

Palin objected: 'While it’s great to listen to your kids’ ideas, there’s also a time when dads simply need to be dads.

'It
would’ve been helpful for him to explain to Malia and Sasha that while 
her friends parents are no doubt lovely people, that’s not a reason to 
change thousands of years of thinking about marriage.'

She
continued: 'Sometimes
dads should lead their family in the right ways of thinking. It 
would’ve been nice if the President would’ve been an actual leader and 
helped shape their thoughts instead of merely reflecting what many 
teenagers think after one too many episodes of Glee.'

While
Palin has been quick to criticise the president, many others have come 
out in support of his historic endorsement of same-sex marriage.

Ellen
DeGeneres, who has been married to actress Portia de Rossi for nearly 
four years, branded the move 'brave' during a taping of her talk show.

'There
have been moments in history when someone has had the courage to stand 
up for what they believe in and that one action changes everything, I 
hope this is one of those times,' she said.

'It
takes a brave man to take a stand like this, especially in an election 
year so to you Mr President I say thank you very, very much.'

Other celebrities have applauded the move, including gay stars Neil Patrick Harris and Ricky Martin.

During his speech, Obama claimed the change is a personal one only, and that he still believes 
the issue of gay marriage should be left up to the states to each decide.

Currently, six states allow gay couples to wed and 30 states have constitutional amendments explicitly banning it.

It appears that the president is 
banking on the issue, which is heavily supported by younger Americans, 
to mobilize the youth vote, which has become disaffected during his term
in office.

Obama had long 
been suspected of supporting gay marriage, but was thought to be afraid 
to make it public because of the political backlash.

But he had been under intense pressure
to clarify his view toward gay marriage after Vice President Joe Biden 
publicly supported it on Sunday.

'I am absolutely comfortable with the 
fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and men 
and women marrying are entitled to the same exact rights, all the 
civil rights, all the civil liberties.

Family affair: Obama said his decision was swayed by his daughters Sasha and Malia, who have friends with gay parents. Palin said he should not listen to his children but he should be a 'leader shaping their views'

'And quite frankly, I don’t see 
much of a distinction beyond that,' Biden said on Meet the Press.

1996, running for Illinois State Senate: 'I favor legalizing same-sex marriages,and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.'

2004, running for US Senate in Illinois: 'My religious faith dictates marriage is between a man and a woman, gay marriage is not a civil right.'

2008, running for US President: 'I believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman. As a Christian it's also a sacred union.'

2010, after Republican wave election: 'My feelings with this are constantly evolving, I struggle with this.'

2012, running for reelection: 'I think same sex couples should be able to get married.'

Obama has famously flip-flopped on the issues. Since 2004, he has opposed gay marriage, saying his beliefs were based on his Christian faith.

He signaled that he was 
open to changing his opinion on gay marriage in 2010 when he said his 
feelings on the issues were 'evolving.' 'I struggle with this,' he famously said.

But, this isn't the first time Obama has changed in mind on the issue.

In
1996, as an Illinois State Senate candidate, he told a gay newspaper in
Chicago that he was in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and 'would
fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.'

Now, he seems to be making an election-year political gamble by directly 
challenging Mitt Romney, his Republican opponent in November.

Before the president's remarks today, Romney re-affirmed his opposition to gay marriage.

'I do not favor 
marriage between people of the same gender and I don't favor civil 
unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name,' he told 
KDVR-TV in Denver.

Thanks: Ellen DeGeneres, along with other celebrities, thanked Obama for the move, which she called 'brave'

Last week, Romney's spokesman for foreign policy, Richard Grenel, quit the campaign after he came under fire from some conservatives for being openly gay. 

Recent
polls show 50 percent of Americans support gay marriage, but also 
reveal that the 45 percent who oppose it have strong convictions.

Just a day before Obama's announcement, voters in the key 
battleground state of North Carolina approved a strict new ban on 
same-sex marriage.

The measure, which prohibits any civil or domestic 
benefits for gay couples, passed by a landslide with 61 percent of the 
vote.
