A string of high-profile public figures including Russell Brand and Maggie Gyllenhaal are fronting a fresh campaign to persuade the public that charges levelled against U.S. military whistleblower Bradley Manning are unjust.

In a new clip uploaded to YouTube this week Manning's supporters take turns to condemn the case against the Army intelligence analyst who leaked millions of classified documents.

It has been released as part of the 'I am Bradley Manning' campaign, which is attempting to galvanise his supporters around that same slogan.

I am also Bradley Manning: Hollywood actress Maggie Gyllenhaal is another of the well-known figures that feature

Manning's trial is now in its third week, following three years of pre-trial detention in conditions that have been criticised by many human rights groups.

The 25-year-old Oklahoma native has acknowledged giving information to WikiLeaks, but said it did not harm national security.

He faces numerous charges, including aiding the enemy, which carries a potential death sentence.

The video intersperses clips from the 
infamous Collateral Murder video leaked by Manning among appearances by 
the likes of director Oliver Stone, Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel
Ellsberg and gay rights in the military activist Dan Choi.

Those commenting tell of how Manning's revelations 'ignited [a] chain of social action' including the Arab Spring revolutions and mass opposition to officially sanctioned torture by U.S. military personnel.

A statement accompanying the video says: 'Amidst courtroom secrecy, whistleblower and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Bradley Manning is on trial after three years of confinement.

'The information that Bradley gave to the public has been a catalyst for pro-democracy movements in the Arab world, exposed the unjust detainment of innocent people at Guantanamo Bay, shown us the true human cost of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and changed journalism forever.

'There is no evidence that anyone died
as a result of the leaked information, yet Bradley faces life in prison
or possibly death.

'The 
greatest charge against him is that of “aiding the enemy,” a capital 
offence. As the public who benefited from this information, does that 
make us the enemy? What price will future whistleblowers pay?'

Facing potential execution: Manning is escorted out of a courthouse in Fort Meade, Maryland, on Monday, as his court-martial enters its third week

In the latest from the Manning trial a
federal judge in Baltimore said yesterday that she's satisfied for now 
with measures the military has taken to release documents related to the
court-martial.

Lawyers for the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights and other groups, including The Associated Press, have complained for more than a year that court documents related to the military case were being released too slowly, if at all.

Earlier this month, however, the Army put the vast majority of the documents online.

The Army also promised to be forthcoming with the documents as Manning's trial, which began June 3, continues at Maryland's Fort Meade. The documents are being posted for the public and press on an Internet site.

But lawyers for the centre said they weren't satisfied. One argued in court on Monday that the Army's turnaround time to release new documents - a goal of one to two days - was too long for journalists covering the trial.

He also objected to redactions and sought access to transcripts or audio recordings of past proceedings.

But on Wednesday, the judge in the case, Ellen Hollander, sided with the Army. In a 42-page ruling she wrote of the lag time in releasing documents that there was 'no indication that such a brief delay is unreasonable.'

And she said she wouldn't order the Army to speed up the release transcripts and audio of past proceedings because it would be 'a serious and unwarranted interference in the operation of the court-martial.'

She also agreed certain redactions were appropriate.

A lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, Shayana Kadidal, said the decision was 'disappointing' and that the centre is considering its options.
