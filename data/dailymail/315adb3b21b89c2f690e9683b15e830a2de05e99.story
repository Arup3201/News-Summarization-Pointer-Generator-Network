Faces jail: Amanda Wheeler drunk vodka, beer and wine before molesting two schoolboys at a friend's 50th birthday

A mother-of-three who drank enough to 'knock out a bull elephant' faces jail after molesting two schoolboys at a friend’s 50th birthday party.

Amanda Wheeler, 31, kissed and groped a 12-year-old boy on a bench, rubbed her breasts against teenagers she was dancing with at the party and performed sex acts on two boys in a bedroom.

Worcester Crown Court heard the part-time cleaner had been drinking vodka, beer and wine throughout the evening.

A jury found Wheeler, from Barbourne in Worcester, guilty of four counts of sexual activity with a child and one of sexual assault.

She was acquitted of a sixth charge of sexual activity with a child, the maximum sentence for which is 14 years in prison.

Judge Patrick Thomas QC granted her bail while pre-sentence and psychological reports were prepared.

He said it was 'a very difficult case' but added he had not yet considered what sentence he should pass.

During the two-week trial, the jury heard Wheeler drank vodka, wine and beer before attending the 50th birthday bash in November last year.

On her way there, she kissed and groped a 12-year-old boy on a bench. On arrival she started 'dirty dancing' a group of teenagers, asking one boy for sex and rubbing herself against the shocked teens.

After midnight Wheeler molested two boys, aged 13 
and 14, in a bedroom. The jury was told she pulled the 14-year-old’s trousers down before 
performing a sex act on him, and forced a 13-year-old to carry out a sex act on her while his private parts were exposed.

James Dunstan, prosecuting, said Wheeler’s behaviour that night had been 'highly flirtatious' while she was trapped 'in a drunken bubble'.

In a video interview with police the 13-year-old boy said Wheeler pounced on him and his 12-year-old friend after plying them with strong Stella Artois lager.

He claimed the trio left her home to go to a party nearby but stopped to sit on a bench in a field.

The victim told officers Wheeler hugged the younger boy 'in a friendly way', before she 'tried to snog him'.

The boy, who is now 14, said she then turned to him, tried to pull down his trousers and bit his neck.

He said she told him she wanted to perform a sex act on him, which made him feel 'disgusted'.

Later at the birthday party the boy said he saw Wheeler 'dirty dancing' with a 15-year-old and asking him for sex, but he refused.

The boy said she then moved over to him and rubbed her breasts on his chest and stomach, before nuzzling his neck and hugging him.

One of the victims told the court he asked Wheeler to stop but she refused and he did not want to push her and hurt her so let her carry on.

Wheeler, who had denied all the offences, told the jury she had an alcohol problem and was taking tablets for depression.

Samantha Forsyth, defending said Wheeler had been 'monumentally stupid' after drinking enough to 'knock out a bull elephant'.

Wheeler will be sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court in January. She was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register.
