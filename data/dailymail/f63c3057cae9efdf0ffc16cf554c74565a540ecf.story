Today, she will travel to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to present 10 Squadron with their new standard.

Next week, Princess Anne will travel the length and breadth of the UK, starting the week with a livestock sale in Perth and ending it with three engagements in Portsmouth.

Yet despite the hours she puts in, the plain-speaking princess gets very little thanks and even less media coverage, all of which begs the question: Why does she do it?

Hard-working: Princess Anne is the unsung hero of the royal family and carries out a huge number of visits

According to Nikki Jeffries, managing editor at Royalista.com, the answer is a sense of duty - something she has inherited from her hard-working parents.  

'The apple never falls far from the tree and Princess Anne has had two very good royal role models in her parents,' she explains.

'None of them has ever craved the limelight, even though they all understand the importance of using their public profile to highlight the causes they support.'

In this, plain-speaking Anne has few equals and makes regular, if rare, contributions to public debate, most controversially on the subject of horses.

Speaking at the annual conference of World Horse Welfare, of which the 64-year-old is president, she caused outrage when she suggested that 'attitudes towards the horse meat trade may need to change'.

Noting that horse neglect is almost unheard of in Poland where horse meat is legal, she added:

'If that is true then, and they value their horses and they look after them well because they are in the horse meat trade, should we be considering a real market for horse meat and would that reduce the number of welfare cases?

'I just chuck that out there for what it's worth because it needs a debate. We have to understand if value has a part to play in how we reduce welfare cases … 

'If it [the horse] has real financial value then you look a little bit further ahead in the way you look after your animals.'

Such a practical approach is typical of the Princess Royal, who has a country-woman's clear-eyed view of livestock, all while owning a much-loved herd of horses - among them a former abuse case that she re-homed.

The same approach can be seen in her philanthropic work of which she does a considerable amount, albeit mostly unrecorded.

'The power of the Princess Royal’s support is that she genuinely understands the issues we aim to address,' says Gareth Simpson of Opportunity International, an organisation that aims to provide finance to would-be entrepreneurs in some of the world's poorest countries.

'Her knowledge of the difficulties facing men and women living in poverty is impressive and brings real gravitas to our charity. 

'She is an important ambassador for our work and supports both what we do and how we do it. It is not  a superficial relationship in any way.'

That she puts so much effort into each charity she supports is all the more impressive given that her current list of philanthropic patronages totals 332.

These range from the Scottish Fat Stock Society to Acid Survivors International and the Bothwell Parish Church Appeal.

Many require travel; the most recent being a flying visit to Ethiopia and Tanzania where she toured projects run by Save the Children, another charity of which Anne is president.

'She has huge knowledge of our history and work, going back to our founder Eglantyne Jebb,' says CEO Justin Forsyth, who has worked with the Princess Royal for many years.

'Over the years she has visited our programmes in some of the remotest and toughest parts of the world from Ethiopia to Mozambique as well as inspiring our volunteers and supporters here at home. 

'She passionately believes that all children should have a chance to fulfil their potential and that the cornerstone of the work of Save the Children is our local staff.'

Interests: She has a huge range of interests and works with Save the Children among others

Busy: Next week Anne, pictured arriving at the South African embassy last year, will criss-cross the UK

Work: Last week saw her count the IFR International Awards Gala among her many visits

Involved: Nevertheless, those who work with her such as the Carers Trust, say she is very involved 

Anne spent much of her Ethiopian tour meeting locals, according to Forsyth, who says her down-to-earth approach never fails to impress.

'Her willingness to roll up her sleeves means she gets a front line view of the challenges children face,' he adds.

'I remember accompanying her on a visit to a slum in Sierra Leone when she decided to jump across open sewers to get to a health clinic and meet our midwives and nurses. 

'She also has a special way of not patronising children, asking them serious questions and getting serious answers.'

The same easygoing attitude is also characteristic of her many UK visits. 'She has a great sense of humour,' says Caroline Cochrane of The Carers Trust.

'She always puts the carers she meets at their ease and is genuinely interested in their stories and how we can continue to improve support for them.' 

Amusing: Anne also has a sense of humour, as Prince Harry's reaction (left) proves, and she is close to Zara

Cochrane, who has worked with the Princess Royal for more than 20 years, says Anne doesn't get the recognition she deserves.

'Her charity work is well known within our field but outside, while people think that Her Royal Highness is hard working royal, they are probably not aware of just how involved she is.'

Simpson, however, suspects that what Anne really wants is to get on with her work with as little fuss as possible.

'My personal perspective is that rather than seeking coverage for her work, she enjoys really exploring the issues that the charity is dealing with,' he explains.

'She does not seek personal publicity,' adds Cochrane. 'She should be allowed to also have a life with her family away from the media.' 

Both of her children, Zara Tindall and Peter Phillips, with whom she shares a passion for all things equine, live on her Gatcombe Estate in Gloucestershire.

She is also thought to be a hands-on grandmother to her three granddaughters, Isla, Savannah and Mia, and has been pictured looking after her youngest granddaughter while Zara pursues her own career in eventing.

Nevertheless, her work often takes her away from them for long periods, with Anne criss-crossing the country like a campaigning politician.

In the first week of February alone, she will spend two days in Scotland, two in London and one in Hampshire, before visiting various parts of Wales and Leicestershire the following week.

Along with spending three days in London, the second week of February will also take her back to Scotland where she will watch a rugby match as part of her role as patron of Rugby Scotland.

To those who know her, this seemingly inexhaustible ability to keep on working come what may and regardless of personal inclination is no surprise.

'Anne is the rock of the royal family,' adds Jeffries. 'She's got her feet firmly on the ground, she cherishes tradition and champions solid family values. 

'She is never going to be thought of as the most popular but she is the one most people would say is doing a good job. And in my opinion, she is.'
