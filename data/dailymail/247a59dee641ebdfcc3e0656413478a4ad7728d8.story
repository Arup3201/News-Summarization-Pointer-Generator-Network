We all noticed Kelly Brook's assets making a guest appearance when she strode onto the red carpet wearing no bra beneath her black dress at the National Television Awards on Tuesday.

But rather than being an anomaly, such public ditching of one's support act has become a recent trend among tars including Kim Kardashian, Miranda Kerr and Gwyneth Paltrow.

And while we've all heard horror stories of what will happen if we plump for bralessness - breasts that swing down below our knees, back pain that could land us in hospital - new research suggests that wearing a bra could actually contribute to these problems.

Contrary to popular belief, wearing a bra 
doesn't prevent sagging or relieve back pain at all, according to a study carried out over fifteen 
years in France.

Researchers at the University of Besançon found that not wearing a bra increases the strength of the breast muscles, which results in them sagging less over time.

Professor Rouillon, who led the study, said he believed the 'absence of a bra could keep breasts in shape' and prevent back ache.

He explained: 'The decision not to a wear a bra appeals to women in terms of comfort and aesthetics. Contrary to popular belief, the breast does not fall, but tightens and lifts, and the quality of the skin improves.’'

Professor Rouillon said 42 per cent of the women 'felt discomfort' for the first three months of not wearing a bra, but then it disappeared. None were in pain, however, nor were they hampered from doing daily activities, including sport.

But don't set your bra alight just yet. Despite his findings, Professor Rouillon said women should not get rid of their bras. His study only involved a small number of women, and the long-term effects of not wearing a bra are unknown.

Indeed, previous research has shown that women who do not wear a sports bra while exercising could be damaging their breasts.

The ligaments which support the breasts are not elastic, and can be irreversibly stretched when the breasts bounce during repetitive or high impact sports.

(Luckily, high-energy activity at award ceremonies is kept to a minimum, so celebrities remain safe when they go braless for the red carpet.)

And aside from health effects, a lack of support can do damage to your career: research carried out by the Centre for Talent Innovation discovered that those who go braless at work are less likely to be promoted to high executive levels. (Unless, of course, said role is as a presenter on Ground Force.)
