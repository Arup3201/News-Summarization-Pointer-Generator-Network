The Athens Olympics were meant to be a celebration of the Games' history, as the spiritual home of Olympic sport hosted the world in the XXVIII Olympiad.

The Greeks poured around €9billion (£7.13billion) into building new stadiums and infrastructure, and despite disputes and delays in the run-up to the event, put on a successful games.

However, a decade on, the stands lie empty, completely unused and allowed to fall into disrepair, as the global economic crisis meant the country's government were unable to invest in the upkeep of the Olympic venues.

Nothing left: A swimming pool from the Olympic village is filled with dirty rainwater and debris a decade after the Athens games

Contrast: Athens' open-air pool during the 2004 Summer Olympics, when it saw Michael Phelps win six gold medals and break two World Records

Welcome home: The Games' motto is one of the few remains left standing in an Olympic park that has almost entirely fallen into disrepair

Empty: The diving venue, where Leon Taylor and Peter Waterfield won silver for Team GB, is now in a sorry state in the Greek capital

Deserted village: The Olympic village that hosted the athletes just ten years ago is now a desolate wasteland covered in graffiti

Falling down: Paint peeling, seats ripped out and benches collapsing, the aquatic centre is a shadow of its former self

Life's a beach: The stand built to house beach volleyball is still standing, but the sand in front of it is overgrown with plants

As it was: The Olympic beach volleyball stadium, complete with extra temporary stands, as it stood during the 2004 games

Team GB won nine Gold medals during the competition, among which the most memorable were middle-distance runner Kelly Holmes' 800m and 1500m double.

In the velodrome Sir Bradley Wiggins and Sir Chris Hoy each won their first Olympic golds as Great Britain recorded their best medal haul in the modern era.

The mens 4x100m relay team of Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish, Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis won gold on the track as the British quartet saw off an American team which included newly crowed individual Olympic champion Justin Gaitlin. 

It was also the games that launched boxer Amir Khan into the limelight, his silver medal in the lightweight division leading to a professional career, while

Elsewhere in Athens a 19-year-old Michael Phelps won the first six of his record 22 gold medals in the pool, setting two World Records in the process.

The games were not without their controversy - most notably when home favourites Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou pulled out of the championships after missing a doping test.

Remains: This is all that's left of the Olmypic Canoe and Kayak Slalom centre where Team GB picked up one silver and two bronze medals

Back then: Britain's Campbell Walsh competes in the final of Olympic Games men's Kayak K1 race in the Hellinoko complex, where he won a silver medal

Torn apart: The Olympic Baseball stadium is now little more than an overgrown field with a broken big screen, surrounded by unused seats

Home run: The baseball stadium as it stood in 2004 - now it is an overgrown ruin

Rapid: The Canoe and Kayak course was still full of water a year after the games. Today it is completely dry, another relic of the 9bn Olympics

All dried up: The Helliniko Olympic complex, which included the canoeing course and the baseball stadium, now lies deserted

But despite the shame of their celebrated athletes, the astronomical cost, and the building difficulties which threatened the games even before they started, the Athens Olympics were seen as a success both in Greece and internationally.

However, Greece was hit hard by the global financial crisis and, with no real post-games plan, the state-of-the-art venues were abandoned.

Ten years on, they are the sad legacy of the event that was supposed to welcome the Olympic Games home.

Load of rubbish: The swimming pool that once hosted international athletes has now become a rubbish dump in Athens

No village people: What was once a luxury hub for the summer games is now a deserted shell in an overgrown wasteland

What's the score? The seats are still in place at the Olympic Hockey Stadium but the broken score-board tells its own story

All over: The beach volleyball venue is no longer used, another of the Olympic venues that has been allowed to fall by the wayside

In use: The beach volleyball stadium has fallen entirely out of use since the end of the games ten years ago

No one left: The derelict stands of the Olympic Baseball stadium are a symbol of the games' decay as economic hardship prevented Greece from maintaining their venues

Broken down: The Taekwondo Stadium is still standing, but the roads outside are covered in rubble and the venue itself is fenced off to visitors

Ruins: Parts of the Athletic Centre in Athens are entirely unrecognisable from the slick venues that the world saw a decade ago
