You may have played with Transformers as a child, but now there’s a serious boy’s toy in the form of a shape-shifting speedboat.

At the touch of a button, the Kormaran can transform from a standard speedboat into a twin-hull catamaran or even three-hull trimaran.

The 21ft (6.4metre) vessel, which is backed by Porsche, uses hydraulic rams to change into six shapes.

At the touch of a button, the Kormaran can transform from a standard speedboat into a twin-hull catamaran (illustrated) or even three-hull trimaran

It is made from carbon fibre, titanium, teak and leather and claims to be the first of its kind in the world.

The vessel is able to 'fly' above the water using hydrofoils at speeds of almost 45mph (72kph) and three jets mean it can travel 100miles (161km) at full throttle.

For more leisurely trips, it can be turned into an extravagant bathing platform.

 ‘The Kormaran is the first of its kind in the world. We have not just developed a new boat, we have invented a new boat class,’ said Florian Schrems, spokesman for the Austrian firm. An illustration of the vessel here, shows an innovative shape designed for stability

USP: The Kormaran can change into six different shapes. These include a speedboat, catamaran and three-hull trimaran.

Size: It is 21ft (6.4metre) long.

Speed: The vessel has a top speed of 45mph (72kph).

Range: It can travel 100miles (161km) at full throttle.

Materials: It's made of carbon fibre, titanium, teak and leather.

Price: The boat will go into production in autumn and cost €1 million plus VAT, which is approximately £900,000 ($1.4 million).

‘The Kormaran is the first of its kind in the world. We have not just developed a new boat, we have invented a new boat class,’ said Florian Schrems, spokesman for the Austrian firm.

‘The design of the Kormaran is driven by function and emotion.

‘The idea was to combine the feeling of driving a comfortable super-sports car cabriolet, the preciseness of aircraft technology and special features of other fascinating vehicles.’

He explained that the vessel can even transform on the go so that a conventional speedboat shape can be used for quick manoeuvres and a catamaran for stability.

‘In addition, the Kormaran can gracefully transform into a large bathing platform, using a minimum of space on transport or storage.’

‘The whole Kormaran is optimised by using aircraft and racing methods to reduce weight wherever possible,’

The Kormaran is the result of a £6 million, eight-year research project that has been part-funded by Daniell Porsche - great-grandson of Porsche founder Ferdinand Porsche.

The firm says it is built for trend-setters, technology pioneers and far-sighted investors of unusual objects.

It will go into production in autumn and cost €1 million plus VAT, which is approximately £900,000 ($1.4 million).
