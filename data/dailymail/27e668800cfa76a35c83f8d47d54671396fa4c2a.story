If Yeovil Town took Wayne Rooney on loan for one month, they would have to sack their whole squad. The Manchester United captain’s £250,000-a-week wages equate to a quarter of Yeovil’s player wage budget for an entire year.

That will be the gulf in resources when the Somerset club, in the third tier of English football, host Louis van Gaal’s side in the third round of the FA Cup.

But, according to midfielder Simon Gillett — who scored the goal that killed their second-round replay against Accrington on Tuesday — that will mean nothing when they meet. ‘That is neither here nor there,’ insisted Gillett.

‘You have one ball, you have two goals, and you have to try to score more. ‘We all know how much they earn, and they are entitled to it, they play at such a high level. I don’t think you will hear any of us complaining. Ultimately that is where we want to be.

‘If you have a good game who knows who is watching, who knows who you will impress?’

The Manchester United aura has flickered in recent years, so who better for them to face than the original non-League giant slayers? Those days outside the Football League are behind Yeovil, but their legend of knocking 17 professional sides out of the competition during that period will remain forever.

And Gillett has warned Van Gaal about fielding a weakened team after United were humiliated in the Capital One Cup. ‘They may look at when they sent a weakened team to MK Dons and it didn’t work out,’ he said.

While at Southampton, Gillett was part of the side United crushed 3-0 in January 2009 and will share his experiences with team-mates. ‘Dimitar Berbatov was on another level, Ryan Giggs too,’ he added. ‘But it will be great. We have nothing to lose. Everybody just has to enjoy it.’

United manager Louis van Gaal will be wary of fielding a weakened side against Yeovil Town in January

Van Gaal's side were thumped 4-0 by League One side MK Dons in the Capital One back in August
