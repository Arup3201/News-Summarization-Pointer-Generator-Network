The family of a married couple murdered by the delusional death row inmate Scott Panetti say they are 'devastated' his execution has been stayed.

Minnie Ybarbo, the daughter of Joe and Amanda Alvarado who were gunned down by the 56-year-old schizophrenic in 1992, says she and her son Junior Herrera, were hoping for 'some kind of closure' and claim the murderer is not as 'crazy' as people believe.

They were on their way to Huntsville in Texas on Wednesday to witness Panetti's execution, 19 years after he was put on death row. 

But around 100 miles before they reached the prison and with just hours to spare, representatives from the attorney general's office told them it would not be going ahead.

Devastated: Minnie Ybarbo, the daughter of Joe and Amanda Alvarado who were gunned down by death row inmate Panetti in 1992, says she and her son Junior Herrera, were looking for 'some kind of closure'

Victims: Joe and Amanda Alvarado, the parents of the death row inmate's estranged wife Sonja, were shot and killed at their home in Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1992

The family claimed that the execution should have happened long ago. The average stay for an inmate on Texas death row is 11 years before he is killed.

The condemned killer was due to be put to death at 6pm (CST) on Wedneday. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia some 14 years before shooting dead his estranged wife Sonja Alvarado's parents in front of her and their three-year-old daughter in Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1992.

At his 1995 capital murder trial, Panetti acted as his own attorney, testified as alternate personality 'Sarge' to describe the Alvarado slayings and tried to subpoena Jesus Christ, the pope and the late President John F. Kennedy.

Panetti wore a purple cowboy outfit, including a big cowboy hat, and largely ignored a standby attorney the judge appointed to assist him. 

The judgement from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas ordered that the execution be halted 'to allow us to fully consider the late arriving and complex legal questions'. 

Describing harrowing accounts of the slayings, Mrs Ybarbo told KENS 5: 'My sister said that my mom just looked in his eyes and looked at Scott, and she knew she was going to be next, and he shot her too.

'It was very devastating because I guess I was looking forward to just having some type of closure.'

Mr Herrera, the victim's grandson, said: 'It (execution) should have happened long ago. Years ago, and to me he's just finding a way to use the system to his advantage.

Halt: Panetti was scheduled to die by lethal injection on Wednesday but the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas stopped it 'to allow us to fully consider the late arriving and complex legal questions'

'He's not as crazy as they think he is. He's not as insane as they say he is.' 

Even though Panetti's death was postponed, the pair believed he will still be executed, it is just a matter of when.  

State attorneys contended Panetti's condition 'has not markedly changed' and he should not be given a reprieve from lethal injection.

No court has ruled Panetti mentally incompetent or insane.

He had been hospitalized more than a dozen times for treatment in the decade before fatally shooting Joe and Amanda Alvarado at their home in the Texas Hill Country in 1992.

Their daughter Sonja, who was married to Panetti, and her three-year-old daughter, Amanda Lea, had moved in with them and she obtained a court order to keep Panetti away.

Ms Alvarado filed for divorce because of her husband's drinking and she said he was obsessed with the notion that the devil lived in their house. 

He buried furniture and nailed the curtains shut. Panetti was also having hallucinations that the devil lived in the walls of the house and began washing the walls, believing that they were running with blood.

On the morning of September 8, 1992, Panetti armed himself with a rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and knives, dressed in camouflage clothing and broke into his estranged wife's parents' home in Fredericksburg, about 60 miles north of San Antonio.

Both Joe and Amanda Alvarado were shot at close range in front of his wife and daughter, before Panetti allowed them to leave. He later changed into a suit and handed himself into the police.

In a sworn affidavit in 1999, Ms Alvarado said that although she hated what her ex-husband did, he was a good man who suffered mental illness and should not be put to death. 

In 1986, the high court ruled states may not execute killers whose insanity means they can't understand why they're being put to death.

In 2002, the justices prohibited the execution of the mentally impaired.

Five years later, ruling on an appeal from Panetti, the court said mentally ill condemned prisoners could be put to death if they have a factual and rational understanding of why they're being punished.

Panetti has insisted Satan is working through Texas prison officials to execute him to keep him from preaching the Gospel.
