A mother has told of the terrifying moment a stranger apparently tried to walk off with her three-year-old son in the middle of a supermarket.

Lucy Wooldridge, 30, said the worrying incident occurred while she was momentarily distracted buying sweets for her two young children at a Co-operative store in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex.

An unknown man allegedly took her young son, Kristian, by the hand and attempted to lead him away saying ‘come here’.

However, the young boy screamed ‘mummy’ and his mother brought him back to her side.

She said: ‘It was horrible - I could hear the panic in Kristian’s voice when he shouted to me.

‘I knew something was wrong so I ran around and saw this man.

‘I called at Kristian to come to me and the man let go and walked away.

‘At first I thought maybe the man was trying to find me, but then staff in the shop said the man hadn’t been in the shop and he had seen Kristian, walked in and grabbed his hand.

‘If I was two seconds later getting to him, he would have gone.’

The terrifying experience has left Ms Wooldridge, from Basildon, Essex, scared to let Kristian out of the house.

She said: ‘I am still a nervous wreck about what happened.

‘I will never forget it - it will stay with me forever.’

Police are now reviewing CCTV footage of the incident, which happened shortly before 5pm on June 26. Officers said inquiries are continuing.

An Essex Police spokesman said: ‘Police were contacted shortly before 5pm to suspicious circumstances at the Cooperative, in Hamlet Court Road, Westcliff.

‘It was reported a male had offered to take the hand of a three-year-old boy.

‘Police arrived at the scene and reviewed CCTV.’

Kristian’s grandmother, Debbie Spooner, 53, is now warning parents to speak to their children about what to do if approached by a stranger.

She said: ‘People need to be aware of what happened.

‘The first thing I thought of was Jamie Bulger.

‘Lucy had told them if they ever can’t see her to shout at her - he remembered to do it.

‘Afterwards, once my daughter knew everything was okay, she just collapsed in tears.

‘It was awful - you can’t put into words the fear that goes through your mind.'
