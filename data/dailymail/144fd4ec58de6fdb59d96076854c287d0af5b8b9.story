A father is attempting to swim 2,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean in under two months.

Ben Hooper, 35, will set off from Dakar in Senegal on 1 November 2015 - and hopes to reach Natal, northern Brazil by New Years Eve.

The father-of-one will swim freestyle for 12 hours a day in two six-hour blocks before sleeping aboard a boat overnight.

The father-of-one will set off from Dakar, Senegal on November 1 - and hopes to reach Natal, northern Brazil by New Year's Eve. He will swim for 12 hours a day in two, six hour blocks

Mr Hooper, who may burn up to 12,000 calories per day, will be swimming in temperatures of around 20- 30 degrees battling currents of 1- 7 knots.

The father, who gave up his full-time study of psychology to take up the challenge, will wear a special suit to protect him from the harsh Equatorial sun as well as any creatures he may encounter - potentially including jelly fish and even sharks.

The father of Georgia, five, told MailOnline today he was pushed into taking up the epic challenge following a difficult year in 2013.

Mr Hooper said: 'The swim is an idea I have been sitting on for a long time.

'I have long been fascinated with the ocean and its wildlife and have always been sporty and fit and thought "now is the time".

The route Mr Hooper will take - hopefully crossing over 2,000 miles in around two months

'I was feeling really uninspired last year and was finding it difficult to do anything. I needed a change and to do something different - so I thought "why not now."

'I left my job and started assembling my team around me. I have always been fit and done a few triathlons and other events - but obviously a challenge of this scale needs professional assistance.

'Training has been really tough - but it's my full-time job.

'I hope to be back on dry land by New Year's Eve - I will be helped along by the sea and should be going at around 4.5 knots.'

Mr Hooper, who lives with his daughter and partner Kate Lewington, 39, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, has been training for over a year - starting with daily swims of about 4-7miles for five-months.

At the start of this year, he moved out in to open water - training in the Mediterranean Ocean and aiming to cover 2.8million meters of swimming, about 115,000 lengths of a 25m pool, by November.

The father says what makes his trip different is the fact the entire adventure will be streamed online - thanks to new technology by SmackDab.

This means viewers will be able to watch every second of his trip will be shown on the trip's official Facebook page.

Earlier in the year, Mr Hooper also announced he would be working with Ridgeline Entertainment - who have created a number of action documentaries such as Discovery Channel's The Deadliest Catch.

The company will be filming throughout the trip to create a documentary of the adventure which will then be shown on television.

According to his website, Mr Hooper will be the first man in history to have swum an ocean in full.

It adds he will be the first man to explicitly and transparently detail his swim - swimming the exact mileage of the intended crossing.

However, others claim they were in fact the first - including American Jennifer Figge who was hailed as the first woman to complete the challenge in 2009.  However, most now regard her expedition as a failed attempt.

Benoît Lecomte also received wide credit for being the first man to swim across the Atlantic Ocean without a kick board in 1998.

The 3,716-mile journey took 73 days - and he was accompanied by a 40ft sailboat complete with electromagnetic field to ward off shark attacks.

Mr Hooper said today: 'I don't want to take anything away from others who say they're swum the Atlantic. But what makes my trip different is that it is transparent.

'Thanks to amazing technology, people will be able to watch every minute of my trip online.'

He will be raising money for three charities: SOS Children, which provides orphans and vulnerable children with a stable and positive family life, Maggie’s Cancer Care Centre in Cheltenham, and Addaction - a leading drug and alcohol charity.
