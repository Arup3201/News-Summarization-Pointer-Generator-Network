Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil came under criticism as the German international swapped shirts at half-time during the Champions League last-16 clash with Monaco.

Ozil exchanged shirts with Monaco's Geoffrey Kondogbia as both sides left the pitch after the first 45 minutes at the  Stade Louis II.

ITV pundit Paul Scholes was quick to criticise Ozil for the premature shirt swap, saying: 'I don't like it. At the end of the game, maybe. But still I'm not a big fan  then.

'You do it that once you're in the tunnel or  in the dressing room, out of the way of everyone. At half-time, it's not for me.'

Arsenal beat Monaco 2-0 but were still knocked out on the away goals rule in the 3-3 aggregate defeat. 

Ozil's shirt swap was similar to that of former Arsenal defender Andre Santos who exchanged shirts at half-time with former fans favourite Robin van Persie.

Van Persie was playing for Manchester United at Old Trafford at the time and the exchange was more than a just a sore point with the Gunners fans.

Santos later apologised to travelling fans for any aggravation that was caused by swapping shirts with the Holland international striker.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger later admitted that he was embarrassed by the Brazilian's actions and supposedly took measures to ensure it didn’t happen again.
