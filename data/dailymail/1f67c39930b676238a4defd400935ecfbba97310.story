A man who boasted on The Jeremy Kyle Show that he was a 'superstud' has been jailed for life after brutally murdering his friend's grandmother so he could steal her £104 pension to pay for a night out.

Liam Naylor, 23, went to the home of Doreen Walker in Cudworth, Barnsley, before stabbing her in the heart and slashing her across the face more than 40 times.  

Now the father-of-four, who was on the TV show for a DNA test and bragged he 'impregnated every woman' he slept with, has been told he will spend a minimum of 33 years behind bars.

Just five months after his television appearance, Naylor, 23, throttled, beat and stabbed 75-year-old Doreen Walker in her own home.

Naylor carried out the savage attack before paying for a night out with friends using the grandmother's stolen £104 pension cash.

Jailing Naylor, Judge Julian Goose said: 'This was a savage, cruel and brutal attack with a large kitchen knife.

'This was a murder for gain so you could steal her pension money - £104. After that you arranged to go our with your friends and spent it on drink, cigarettes and takeaway food. This was a particularly serious murder.'

He went on: 'Even more chilling during the time you were in the house you were texting your friends to make arrangements for your night out.'

Mrs Walker's daughter Sharon Jones said in a victim impact statement: 'She was such a loving, kind woman and saw the good in everybody and was too trusting at times.

'How could she be taken from us by someone she took into her own home. She didn't deserve to die like this.'

Naylor appeared on the programme just five months before he stabbed Doreen Walker to death in her home

Naylor was captured on CCTV entering Mrs Walker's home about 9.30pm and emerged two hours later

Following the attack Naylor, who has four children to two different partners, then tried to wash the blood from his hands and went upstairs and stole the money which he had earlier placed in a jewellery box.

Liam Naylor appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show on November 1, 2013.

He had told host Kyle that although he had split up with his ex-girlfriend, he had slept with her since and was the father of her young child.

But she claimed he was lying and he demanded a DNA test to prove he was the biological father.

He told Kyle: 'I get everybody pregnant. I have two kids and one on the way. I impregnate every woman I have been with.'

Naylor claimed his ex had cheated on him three times and he no longer loved her.

He told the host the only thing he wanted was to be there for his children. 

But his ex-girlfriend then claimed he 'stole' money which should have gone to his children.

Kyle eventually revealed the paternity test results which showed that Naylor was the father.

He then laid his victim's head on a cushion on the floor.

In his defence, Naylor claimed the pensioner had 'jumped into the knife' after he disarmed her when she attacked him and then he used the knife on her.

He told the court that he feared for his own safety. 'I felt it was the right thing to do to calm her down,' he said.

Naylor was found guilty of murder by a jury at Sheffield Crown Court after a week-long trial.

Simon Waley, prosecuting, said Naylor's claim of self-defence was 'ludicrous and utterly incredible.'

He said the attack on the grandmother, who had three children and five grandchildren, was savage, brutal and sustained.'

Just three weeks earlier Naylor and his friend Keeley Sweeney had stayed with Mrs Walker who is Miss Sweeney's grandmother. 

After killing Mrs Walker at her three bedroom home, Naylor, whose jeans were covered in blood, told friends he had been in a fight.

He texted: 'I want to get drunk. Get me some clothes ready.'

He then went out in Barnsley with two friends. Naylor paid for drinks at a bar, food at McDonalds and a taxi.

Police arrested Naylor after Mrs Walker's body was found in her home the following morning by her son-in-law

He gave himself up the next day in Skegness.

It was only when later presented with the prosecution evidence that he changed his story claiming Mrs Walker had attacked him after he went to steal her money.

He claimed in the witness box: 'She basically jumped at me and punched me. As she did so she just jumped into the knife.' 

The victim's son-in-law found Mrs Walker's body the next day on April 2 after neighbours smashed their way into the house.

On the Jeremy Kyle show on November 1 last year, Naylor said although he had split up with his ex-girlfriend he had slept with her since and was the father of her young child.

She said he was lying but he replied: 'I get everybody pregnant. I have two kids and one on the way. I impregnate every woman I have been with.'

Naylor claimed his ex had cheated on him three times and he no longer loved her. 'The only thing I want to be there for is my kids,' he said.

His ex then claimed he 'stole' money which should have gone to his children.

Kyle eventually revealed the paternity test results which showed that Naylor was the father.

After the hearing investigating officer Det Supt Richard Fewkes said: 'It remains unclear what was going through his mind when he committed one of the most brutal murders I have dealt with in my 29 years in the force.

'It was brutal, savage and unprovoked. The account he put forward that he was acting in self-defence was ludicrous and the evidence against him was overwhelming.

'I have watched Liam Naylor give evidence throughout the trial and there has been an air of arrogance about him. On occasions he was smiling. That sums him up.

'Dorothy was very much a home bird. She was elderly, frail and had the onset of arthritis but showed great kindness and on occasions she extended that kindness to Naylor which makes this offence even more abhorrent.'
