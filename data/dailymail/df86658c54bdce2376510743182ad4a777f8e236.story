Picking the perfect outfit for your office Christmas party is always a challenge not least because it's the one night of the year where getting your look spot on is crucial.

But if you're left quailing at the thought of spending hours trawling through the shops, a new app could prove to be exactly what you need.

The brainchild of 25-year-old entrepreneur, Cally Russell, from Edinburgh, the Mallzee app works a little like Tinder and matches you with your perfect sartorial partner at the swipe of a finger.

Clever: The app logs your preferences and body shape to match you with your ideal ensemble

Searching more than two million items of clothing from over 200 retailers, the free app, which can be downloaded from iTunes, learns your individual style and hunts down the clothes most suited to you.  

If you're prone to impulse purchases, the app has a useful function that lets your friends rate the item you're considering before you buy it.

If they don't like it - and you can't convince them that you're right - the app won't allow you to purchase the piece at all.

least because it also connects with your friends' devices - and if they don't like the item you're contemplating, the app won't let you buy it.

'In the modern day, as people have less and less time to spare, we wanted to create a product where people could quickly find clothes that suited them,' explains Russell.

Revolutionary: CEO Cally Russell says the app will make shopping online and in store quicker and easier

'We search over 200 top brands to create an effortlessly simple online shopping experience- just like a personal shopper in your pocket.

'There shall be no more trawling through hundreds of pages of clothes online, thanks to Mallzee.'

The app, which launched this week, already boasts big name brands such as ASOS, Urban Outfitters, Topshop and French Connection, but Russell says he hopes to add more.

But before that happens, there's the small matter of dressing the nation for Christmas to contend with.

'Now’s the perfect time for Mallzee to be available to everyone,' adds Russell. 'We’ll make sure we find you the perfect outfit to keep you looking stylish this festive season and ensure your Christmas party is a roaring success.'
