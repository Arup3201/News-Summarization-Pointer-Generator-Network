At a casual glance, you might have thought that the Scottish Nationalists had chosen today to unleash a torrent of new plans for their country if September's referendum on independence goes their way.

From plans for a new flag, to a new pound coin, new road laws and even a new monarchy, this morning's papers were full of policies fleshing out what the new nation might be like.

But not so fast. It is, of course, April 1 - and the plans being unveiled were nothing more than elaborate April fool's pranks.

Banishing the blue: How the new Union Jack will look, according to secret Government documents

Iconic: The flag that has been famous for more than 200 years

Flagged up: An aide accidentally shows papers detailing the plan as he steps out of a car

The Daily Mail led the way, with its story about what the Union flag would look like if Scotland casts itself adrift. 

According to Secret Government papers, it claimed, the cross of St Andrew, a white X on a blue background that makes up a third of the current design, could be ditched.

That would leave a modified Union Jack comprising only the red cross of St George – representing England and Wales – and the red saltire of Ireland’s St Patrick.

Meanwhile the Guardian made the unlikely - and downright dangerous - claim that an independent Scotland would embrace 
driving on the right to show the country is 'part of Europe'.

Scot-free! How the Daily Mail revealed what the Union flag would look like if Scotland votes ¿yes¿

It said that Scottish nationalist leaders were attempting this week to give the trailing yes campaign a boost by revealing a series of measures aimed at showing what an independent country would look like.

Seeking to capitalise on the arguments this week about 'bullying' England and keeping the pound, they will unveil an ambitious scheme to scrap the current – English inspired – road signage system.

Fighting for independence: Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond with a Scottish flag

The Guardian's feature claimed the country would embrace driving on the right side of the road

M for motorway will be replaced with a new S – for Scotland and the A trunk roads will become N roads – for Nationalist in honour of the new country. Blue will be the predominant backing colour.

The Times continued the Scottish theme with its spoof.

It claimed that the German Duke, His Royal Highness Ferdinand, descended from the last Stuart king and would have a claim to the throne of an independent Scotland.

Quotes from a source said: 'These are tricky legal waters... If we revert to a Scotland that, constitutionally at least, we last saw in the 1600s, it does seem the Stuarts have rather more of a right to reign than a Windsor.'

The name of the Dublin University expert, Amadan Giblean, is a Gaelic translation of April Fool.

The Daily Telegraph said plans have been unveiled for a new Scottish pound coin in the event of a victory for the Yes campaign in September's referendum.

The Daily Telegraph reported how plans had been unveiled for a new Scottish pound which would feature the face of Alex Salmond

'The plan' would be introduced on April 1, 2015, and the head of Scotland’s First Minister would replace the Queen.

Some papers did look beyond Scotland for their joke stories, however. The Sun ran with the Queen has given 'her royal seal of approval' to prospectors for fracking in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.

'Fracking could reduce rocketing utility bills that cost the royals up to £3.1 million a year,' the paper said.

'A palace source said: 'Even Prince Charles is convinced.'"

ITV's Daybreak and the Daily Express both carried a story about the first farmer in the world to rear chickens that lay square eggs.

Gotcha! The Express also feature a story about shoppers scrambling for square eggs

'While the shape makes it convenient for eating, it also means making egg sarnies has become even simpler,' the expert said.

And The Mirror revealed how North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has drawn up plans to challenge the worldwide dominance of One Direction.

According to the red top he has banned them from entering the country unless 'the boys opt for the short-back-and-sides hairdo he models'.

In a bid to provide competition for Harry Styles and co, the leader will set up an X Factor-style talent show to find his own hit band - dubbed Un Direction.

Meanwhile, the Metro revealed how national treasures Ant and Dec had confirmed their split after falling out in a north London branch of IKEA.

It said that the presenting duo, whose friendship stretches back 25 years, are reportedly no longer on speaking terms as Dec prepares to launch a solo career with the pair's old management team.

‘Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly have gone their separate ways after a long and successful entertainment career as a double act,’ their spokesperson Flora Lopis confirmed.

‘Dec will now be known simply as Dec and is excited to get back to work as soon as possible. He is already looking into future projects and has signed up for a new series of Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.’

The Express revealed how Arsenal and Tottenham have sealed a deal for a groundshare at the Emirates

The Express claimed to have an exclusive revealing how Arsenal and Tottenham have sealed a deal for a groundshare that will see both teams play their home games at the Emirates Stadium.

Arsenal agreed to the stunning collaboration after crunch talks with Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, it was said.

But claims that the Emirates' 60,000 seats will alternate between red and white from game to game were unlikely to go down well with supporters either.

King's College Choir in Cambridge even joined in the fun.

In a clip posted on YouTube, chaplain Rev Richard Lloyd Morgan said young boys were no longer singing in the choir and therefore choral scholars would have to revert to using helium balloons.

Mr Lloyd Morgan said: 'The complexity of the regulations involved mean that it really is no longer practical to have young boys singing in the choir and this is a great shame because high male voices have been part of the choir’s sound for more than 500 years.

'After a lengthy consultation process during which we learned that the surgical solution was surprisingly unpopular with the choral scholars, somebody in the chemistry department came up with a very simple solution and now all we need is a very large tank of helium.'

Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, arriving for his first day to study Agricultural Management at the University of Cambridge

Prince William found himself on the receiving end of an April Fool's joke yesterday with a report he had ended his Cambridge University degree - with a lowly third.

The Duke of Cambridge has been studying agricultural management at the historic university since January.

His ten-week course has been interrupted by royal duties in the UK and abroad.

Student newspaper The Tab claimed Wills graduated with a third-class honours degree - putting him in the bottom 15th per cent of attendees.

As part of the prank they claimed the new father 'quickly began to struggle with combining the student and the regal life'.

They superimposed the Prince's head on a body wearing a Cambridge gown holding his mocked-up degree certificate.

The Tab quoted a fictional Director of Studies, Dr Canniedo, saying: 'It was always difficult for Prince William to balance his royal and family obligation with his studies.

'We did everything we could to help him in this regard.

Student newspaper The Tab claimed William graduated with a third-class honours degree

'While I cannot compromise student confidentiality, William was, needless to say, unaccustomed to mingling with students from different backgrounds.

'His tutor and I are disappointed with the result, but wish him well in the future.'

At the end of the tounge-in-cheek article on cambridgetab.co.uk the writers admitted the result was just an April Fools prank.
