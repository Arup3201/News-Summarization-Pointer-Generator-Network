Obsessed with football and striving to become the best player he could, Danny Walsh silently slipped into the grip of a vicious eating disorder.

His weight plummeted to just six stone.

The then 22-year-old was suffering anorexia - one of around 176,000 men in the UK battling an eating disorder.

But in just four months, Mr Walsh  turned his life around, taking control and learning how to beat his illness.

After being admitted to The Priory in July 2012 he underwent regular therapy, channelling his energy into eating healthy meals.

But it is body-building that he credits with fuelling his recovery and his parents for saving his life.

Danny Walsh, now 24, from Preston, fell victim to anorexia after becoming obsessed with being a better football player. At the height of his illness, his weight plummeted to just six stone, left. But within four months he beat his illness, gaining weight thanks to body-building, right

After being admitted to The Priory, Mr Walsh underwent therapy, channelling his energy into eating healthy meals. But it was body-building that drove his recovery, he said

Weighing in at just over 10 stone, the now 24-year-old is a healthy weight for his height, having completed his recovery.

'Looking back now is scary, I looked like a skeleton,' he said. 'I'd been quite dumpy at school and because of my asthma could never play footy.

'Once I stopped suffering with it I got really into it and joined my local team.  

'I convinced myself that the slimmer I was, the fitter I became so I really cut down on my eating.'

Despite eating much less than before, Mr Walsh, from Preston, continued a punishing regime of exercise, leaving him exhausted.

The result was that half-way through his second year as an electrician's apprentice, he was let go having become so weak. 

Concerned, his father John Walsh, convinced his son to visit a GP.

He was referred to hospital and at the end of 2007, Mr Walsh, then aged 18, was admitted to the psychiatric unit at Chorley Hospital in Lancashire.

There, for the first time in a year, he ate a proper meal of sausage and mashed potato.

Steadily his weight rose to a stable 9st 7lbs.

And six months after being admitted, Mr Walsh got a new job at a bookmakers. 

But just as he appeared to have a grip on recovery, two tragic losses in Mr Walsh's life sent his weight spiralling down again.

'My colleague had  become a second mum to me, and her death, coupled with my nan's knocked me for six,' he said.

'I didn't know what to do - everything felt out of control.

'Anorexia felt like the only thing I had any power over.' 

Mr Walsh's weight became so low his health took a turn for the worse. He was suffering a high blood pressure and heart problems because of his anorexia

But now, the 24-year-old has beaten his illness. He said: 'Now I'm putting about 3,500 calories in my body every day to make sure I'm fuelled.'I feel so much healthier now - fit as a fiddle. I know how lucky I've been'

It was Mr Walsh's obsession with football, left, that triggered his eating disorder. Now he is fully recovered, he is planning to travel to Poland for a nose job, to complete his transformation and boost his confidence

As Mr Walsh's weight plummeted again, his health took a turn for the worse. He was suffering a sky high blood pressure and heart problems. 

Mr Walsh was admitted to the Priory as an outpatient where he received regular therapy to address his depression as well as the eating disorder.

When he was discharged Mr Walsh forced himself to stop running for two months while he increased his calorie intake.

A few months later he took up body-building. 

Within four months his weight had shot up as his muscles toned and stepping on the scales revealed he was a healthy 10st 3lbs.  

He said: 'I had all the knowledge to make body-building work for me.

'At my worst I could recite the calories off every packet in the supermarket - I was obsessed.

'I turned that sort of obsession on its head, making sure I knew I was getting all the right nutrients.

'I bought a bench and set of weights and focus on body-building, doing a bit of cardio and eating healthily.

'Now I'm putting about 3,500 calories in my body every day to make sure I'm fuelled.

'I feel so much healthier now - fit as a fiddle. I know how lucky I've been though.

'If I hadn't had my mum and dad at my worst I know I'd have died.

'They were the only thing keeping me going.'

Having fully recovered his anorexia, Mr Walsh is set to travel to Poland to have rhinoplasty to complete his transformation and increase his confidence.

Adam Kalecinksi from Europesurgery said: 'Having seen Danny's incredible recovery I'm more than happy to help him complete his transformation.

'Confidence is a big issue for him and I hope by having this surgery that will make him feel even more comfortable in his skin.'
