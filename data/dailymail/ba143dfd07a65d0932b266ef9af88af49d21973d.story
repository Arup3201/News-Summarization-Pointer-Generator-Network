Almost 60,000 Londoners aged between 30 and 39 abandoned the capital to move elsewhere in England according to new figures released by the Office for National Statistics. 

Between June 2012, and June 2013, 58,220 people in their 30s left the capital, with almost one in ten of them moving to Birmingham. 

A further 3,290 went to Bristol, slightly ahead of the 3,260 who headed north to Manchester. Nottingham, Oxford, Liverpool and Newcastle were also popular destinations for Londoners leaving the capital. 

Almost 60,000 people in their 30s have left London over a 12 month period according to new statistics

Many of those leaving the capital are moving north where they can avail of far cheaper housing 

According to economic experts, the flight of well educated professionals from London to provincial centres could help the country's unbalanced economy. 

Ed Cox, director of the IPPR North think-tank told the Observer: 'Young people may be initially attracted by jobs in the capital, but then they recognise that if they want to move on and get on to the housing ladder, there are opportunities in other cities. We are starting to see the benefits of the recovery, particularly for higher-skilled jobs that are being created in cities outside London.'

Neil Rami of Marketing Birmingham told the Independent the city has worked incredibly hard to rebrand its image and rebuild its infrastructure.

He said: 'We are tearing down the concrete of the 1960s, transforming the city centre, and drastically improving our infrastructure. Birmingham’s quality of life is also helping to attract people here, particularly those with families. It has one of the youngest and most diverse populations in Europe – and the city’s unique blend of music, cuisine and arts makes Birmingham a great place to live.'

The ONS based their migration figures by extrapolating data held on NHS databases of people registering with new GPs.

The average price of a house in London is currently £400,000, compared with just £133,000 in Birmingham. 

Interpreting the data, the ONS claimed that married couples in their 30s are being forced out of the capital by the high price of family homes. The figures suggest that some couples are leaving before they start a family or while their children as still young. 

According to the ONS briefing document: 'They may be seeking somewhere greener and quieter, and may also perceive that a less urban neighbourhood offers a better social and educational environment for children.' 

The figures also suggest there has been a net outflow of children from the capital. 

The ONS suggested that a spike in the number of 19-year-olds leaving London is probably due to students going to university.
