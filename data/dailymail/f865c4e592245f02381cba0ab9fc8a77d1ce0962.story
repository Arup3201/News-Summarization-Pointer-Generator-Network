Australian golfer Robert Allenby has recalled his terrifying ordeal after he was kidnapped, beaten and robbed in Honolulu on Friday night, saying he feels lucky to be alive.

Allenby was at the popular Amuse Wine Bar in the tourist-laden Waikiki with his close friend Anthony Puntoriero after missing the cut at the Sony Open - and isn't sure whether he'll be able to compete in next week's Humana Challenge

The 43-year-old believes the suspects may have drugged him before he was taken to an underground car park where he was knocked out, robbed and thrown into the boot of a car.

Australian golfer Robert Allenby was kidnapped from a bar, robbed and beaten up in Hawaii

Allenby, 43, was in the country playing the Sony Open but missed the cut on Friday

The golfer was drinking at Amuse Wine Bar about five miles from his hotel when he was kidnapped

'Medically, I thankfully didn't suffer anything major beyond some bumps and bruises that will take a bit of time to heal,' Allenby said in a statement released by the PGA Tour on Sunday.

'My plan currently is to fly back to the mainland and at that point, evaluate my ability to play next week at the Humana Challenge.

'Whatever the outcome regarding my ability to play next week, I anticipate a successful rest of the 2014-15 PGA Tour season.'

Allenby has noticeable damage and lacerations to his nose and forehead.

'I didn't think I was going to survive this one,' Allenby said earlier on Sunday.

'I was separated from my friend in the bar after we had paid the tab at 10:48pm and he went to the bathroom and next thing you know I'm being dumped in a park miles away.

'I only know this part because a homeless woman found me and told me she saw a few guys pull up and throw me out of the car. That is where I got the scrapes above my eye from the sidewalk.'

Shaken and in a bad way Allenby realised he was without his phone, wallet or any cash and was starting to be harassed by other homeless people in the park.

'The homeless woman got me away from the others and then a retired military guy walking past came to my aid,' he said.

'He got me into a taxi and paid for me to get to my hotel and I called police from there. I have his details and will be getting back in touch with him for sure.' 

The Sony Open was held at the Waialae Country Club and Allenby was staying at the nearby Kahala Hotel

The Australian failed to make the cut after the first two days of play and was relaxing on Friday night

Born: 12 July, 1971

Turned pro: 1992

Joined PGA Tour: 1999

Best major results: Equal seventh, U.S. Open (2004), The Open Championship (2008)

Best Australian PGA result:2005 'triple crown', winning the Australian Masters, Open and PGA

Earnings: Allenby is 27th on the all-time list for the PGA Tour with $27,329,892 

The four-time PGA Tour winner has been assisting police and PGA Tour FBI officials with inquiries.

'We have some names and numbers and they have some leads to follow up, so I am confident they will get the guys,' Allenby said.

'With the FBI guys involved, they're the best, the guys on the tour are awesome, and they'll get to the bottom of it.'

Allenby was most concerned about potentially not being able to call 13-year-old daughter Lily for her birthday, but scans have cleared him of any serious facial or head injuries and he is hopeful of being cleared to fly in the next day or two.

'She's really upset about it but at the end of the day it could have been a lot worse,' the Victorian said.

'I don't care about the money or my cards or anything like that. I am just glad I have survived this one.'

According to The Golf Channel reporter Steve Sands who originally broke the story, Allenby was put into a car, woke up in a park 'groggy' and with no recollection of the events, before he was found by a retired military individual. 

The Australian golfer was then returned to the Kahala Hotel where he had spent the week while playing at the Sony Open held at the nearby Waialae Country Club - where Allenby failed to make the cut after the first two days of play.

His friend Anthony Puntoriero - who was with Allenby earlier on the night - confirmed he was kidnapped. 

'He's all right now but we are still talking to detectives,' Puntoriero told AAP.

Puntoriero and Allenby's caddy were not with the four-time PGA Tour winner at the moment of the abduction. 

Allenby was set to head back to the US on Saturday morning, but has stayed on to assist police with their investigations.

He reportedly managed to piece together some of the night after being reunited with Puntoriero and his caddy, and CCTV footage from the wine bar is being reviewed in an attempt to identify the perpetrators.

The 43-year-old has been a professional golfer since 1992, and while a consistent performer on the PGA Tour for 15 years he has never won a major tournament.

Allenby's best result at a major was to finish equal seventh - which he achieved twice - at the 2004 U.S. Open and the 2008 Open Championship.

He won Australia's 'triple crown' in 2005 - winning the Masters, Australian PGA and Australian Open.

He's also been a regular in the Presidents Cup, representing the International team five times between 1993 and 2009. 

The Melbourne-born golfer now lives in the U.S. full time, in Jupiter, Florida. 

Allenby's caddie, Mick Middlemo, said he was groggy after being woken up and had no recollection of what had happened. A passer-by found him and returned him to his hotel.

The Golf Channel reports he returned to the wine bar to review the surveillance footage. No arrest has been made at this point.
