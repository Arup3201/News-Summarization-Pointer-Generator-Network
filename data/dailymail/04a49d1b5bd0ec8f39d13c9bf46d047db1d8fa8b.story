Former Nottinghamshire Pc Simon Jones admitted having sexual relationships with two victims of crime, and has been jailed for two years

A former police officer has been jailed for two years for misconduct in a public office after admitting to having sexual relationships with victims of crime.

Former Nottinghamshire PC Simon Jones slept with one woman while on duty and in uniform after taking a statement at her home - and a second while on his way into work for a night shift.

A court heard the 33-year-old, who wept as the offences against him were outlined, targeted the 'vulnerable' women with 'unparalleled persistence, vigour and enthusiasm'.

He pleaded guilty to two counts of misconduct in a public office at a hearing at Nottingham Crown Court in October.

The 32-year-old, who moved to South Wales after resigning from Nottinghamshire Police in September, was sentenced yesterday to two years in prison at Nottingham Crown Court.

After the case, senior officers said his behaviour was 'reprehensible' and a 'shocking abuse of power'.

The hearing was told Jones was based at Worksop police station in Nottinghamshire.

His first victim was a mother-of-two who complained in March 2011 that her violent ex-partner had attacked her.

Jones targeted a second woman, aged 37, in March 2012 when he went to investigate after a window at her home had been smashed.

Nottingham County Court heard how Jones targeted the 'vulnerable' women with 'unparalleled persistence, vigour and enthusiasm'

When detectives examined Jones’ phone, they found personal details of four other women, one of whom he had exchanged 2,531 texts with.

Jonathan Straw, prosecuting, said: 'He patently pursued these women he met during his role as a police officer. He is a predatory man who pursued the women with unparalleled persistence, vigour and enthusiasm.'

Following the sentencing, Detective Superintendent Jackie Alexander, head of the Force’s Professional Standards Directorate, said: 'What Simon Jones did goes against everything that we, as a police force, stand for.

'Jones should have been there to protect vulnerable people and uphold the law, not take advantage of their situation for his own sexual gratification.

'It is right that he has been sent to prison for his conduct; he abused his position of trust and failed to meet the high standards of integrity and professionalism that we expect from all our employees.

'We continue to support Jones’ victims in dealing with a number of issues that coming forward has meant for them. I hope that today’s sentencing shows how seriously the Force deals with the behaviour of this nature and that no one is above the law.'
