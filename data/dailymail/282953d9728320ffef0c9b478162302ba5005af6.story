A father watched helplessly as his wife and son burned to death after their car was involved in a hit-and-run horror crash in Florida.

Eliezer Soto Maldonado and his 10-year-old daughter Ana were able to get out of their vehicle after it was struck by a tractor trailer and exploded in flames.

But his wife Deborah and 12-year-old son Eliezer Jr were unable to undo their seat belts.

Police said Maldonado, 34, and his daughter Ana, could do nothing as the car burst into flames on interstate I-75 near Ocala, Florida.

The horrific crash was allegedly caused by Lanessa Riobe who was arrested after fleeing the scene.

A Florida Highway Patrol spokesman said Riobe was driving behind Maldonando when she hit the rear of his Honda Civic car causing it to spin into the centre guardrail.

Maldonado lost control of his car and veered back into the northbound lane where it came to a halt.
