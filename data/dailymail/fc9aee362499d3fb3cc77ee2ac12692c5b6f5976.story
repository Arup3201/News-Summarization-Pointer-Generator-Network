Freedom of movement: Royal Horticultural Society has agreed to lift its ban on garden gnomes at the Chelsea Flower Show

It is a controversial and flagrant display of discrimination that has plagued one of Britain’s most august institutions for decades.

But now the 208-year-old Royal Horticultural Society has caved in to public pressure – and finally agreed to lift its ban on garden gnomes at the Chelsea Flower Show.

Officials had previously been accused of taking a snobbish attitude to the ornaments, which many deride as ‘tacky’.

But this year, on the 100th anniversary of the show, gnomes are not only to be allowed into the grounds – but will be positively celebrated.

Celebrities will be invited to decorate the diminutive gentlemen... and a parade of 150 of them will be lined up for official inspection by the Queen.

The U-turn marks a victory for green-fingered rebels who had taken to smuggling gnomes into their displays at the prestigious event.

RHS director-general Sue Biggs admitted ‘there were a few raised eyebrows’ when the rules were overturned last month, explaining: ‘We are a learned society and a purveyor of excellence in horticulture.’

But she said that the society’s 17-member ruling council was unanimous in voting through the change, adding: ‘It is important for people to realise we have got a sense of humour and we don’t take ourselves too seriously. There was not one gnomophobe on the council.’

Previous years have seen placard-bearing protesters at the gates of the flower show, demanding ‘equal rights for gnomes’.

The
 most high-profile dissident was Jekka McVicar, a 13-time Chelsea gold 
medallist who was rebuked for sneaking her 8in lucky mascot, Borage, 
into her display in 2009, defying the ban on ‘brightly coloured 
creatures’.

On hearing the rule had been overturned, a delighted Mrs McVicar said: ‘It’s great news. I am so excited I’m going to give Borage a new jacket. It’s beige at the moment but it’s going to be bright green with pink spots. There’s no need for camouflage any more.

‘It really shows how far the RHS has evolved. When Borage was spotted in my garden, it caused a real stir and I was met with a lot of stony silences from colleagues. But it really is harmless fun. At last the RHS has grown up and recognised that garden gnomes are for all.’

Ann Atkin, who owns 2,000 gnomes at her Gnome Reserve in Devon, added: ‘It’s about time Chelsea allowed them. I’ve seen plastic  windmills at Chelsea, so why not gnomes? They’re much nicer.  Some people are so snobbish about gnomes.’

RHS officials were previously branded ‘stuffy old gits’ for the ban. The official explanation was that the ornaments might distract from the horticultural displays – although the suspicion was always that they were considered too tacky.

However, gnomes were not always held in such low regard.

When first introduced to Britain they were expensive collectors’ items. They are believed to have been brought to Britain in 1867, when gardener Sir Charles Isham brought 21 earthenware figurines from Germany for the grounds of Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire. Sir Charles was a spiritualist who believed they had protective powers. But gnomes lost their cachet when they were made from plastic.

Although the RHS has relaxed its ‘no gnomes’ rule for this year’s flower show – which runs from May 21 to 25 – other items will remain on its prohibited list, including fairies and pixies, balloons and flags.

Stars decorating gnomes at the show include Downton Abbey writer Lord Fellowes. They will be sold in aid of the RHS campaign to install more gardens in schools.
