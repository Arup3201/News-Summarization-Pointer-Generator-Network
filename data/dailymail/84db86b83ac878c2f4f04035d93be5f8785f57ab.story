On trial: Theodore Wafer, 55, initially told police that the shooting was an accident

The white suburban Detroit man who killed an black unarmed teenager on his porch told police immediately after the shooting that it was an accident and that he didn't know his shotgun was loaded, jurors have heard this morning.

The statements from Theodore Wafer, which he made to police minutes after he blasted Renisha McBride in the face, contradict his defense team's claim that Wafer feared for his life when he opened fire.

Wafer, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, met officers outside his Dearborn Heights, Michigan, home after they responded to his 911 call around 4.30am on November 2.

'What happened here?' Sergeant Rory McManmon asked, according to the recording played by prosecutors.

'A consistent knocking on the door, and I'm trying to look through the windows and the door,' Wafer said.

'It's banging somewhere else so I open up the door, kind of like who is this? And the gun discharged.

'I didn't know there was a round in there,' Wafer told McManmon.

'I don't get it. Who's knocking on your door at 4.30 in the morning? Bang, bang, bang - somebody wanting in.'

This is the Mossberg pump-action shotgun that killed Renisha McBride last November. Wafer told police he didn't think it was loaded

Murdered? Renisha McBride, 19, was shot in the face through a screen door after she knocked on Wafer's house at 4.30am

Pictures of the weapon reveal that it is a Mossberg pump-action 12-gauge shotgun with a pistol grip. The pistol grip means that it is a weapon built for home defense, not for hunting - like many shotguns are used.

Wafer's words minutes after the shooting stand in stark contrast to how his characterized the his feelings before the shooting.

McBride's pounding on the door at such an early hour led Wafer to think his life was in danger, defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter told jurors in her opening statement on Wednesday.

'"People were trying to get in." That was reasonable for Ted to believe and that's what he believed that night," Carpenter said, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Wafer, 55, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of Renisha McBride, who appeared on his porch three and a half hours after crashing her car a half-mile away in Detroit.

He told police that the victim, later identified as 19-year-old McBride, looked like a 'neighbor girl or something.' McBride didn't live in the neighborhood, and an autopsy revealed she was extremely drunk.

Wafer's lawyers say he shot McBride in self-defense. Prosecutors, however, say he should have called police if he feared for his safety.

Police asked Wafer about his weapon, which was on the ground in the foyer of his home when officers arrived.

'It's a little Mossberg, you know, shotgun. Self-defense,' Wafer replied.
