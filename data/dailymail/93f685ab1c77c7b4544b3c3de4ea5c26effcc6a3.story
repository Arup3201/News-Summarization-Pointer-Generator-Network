Rickie Lambert is on the verge of completing a sensational move to Liverpool and his journey represents a victory for hope and hard work.

The 32-year-old has played in every 
division but famously had to go part-time when he was released by Blackpool 
earlier in his career and work screwing the tops on beetroot jars in a factory.

Now he is in the England World Cup squad and set to rejoin his boyhood club, who released him when he was a teenager.

That rejection hit Lambert hard, as he admitted earlier in the season: ‘I was at Liverpool from age 10 to 15 and
 I was basically told I wasn’t good enough, which obviously was a hard 
thing to take at the time.

‘I thought it was the end of the world. But I can tell people in the 
same situation that it is not the end of the world. It should drive you 
on to succeed even more.'

His
 career prospects seemed even more bleak when, after just two matches in
 three years, Lambert was released by Blackpool in 2000.

From
 there, it was the beetroot factory and part-time football with 
Macclesfield. It was a dark time for Lambert, something he has not shied
 away from discussing.

‘After leaving Blackpool there was a period without a club,' he said. 'I didn’t 
have a contract, so I wasn’t getting paid for four or five months. It 
was a very difficult time. I was debating what I could do outside the 
game. But I didn’t want to do anything outside of football.

Partnership: Grant Holt was Lambert's strike partner at Rochdale and also went played in the Premier League

‘So I was trying my best to get to training at Macclesfield because it wasn’t close.

‘I had to get a job and that one in the beetroot factory was one of the 
only jobs I could get at the time. I was putting lids on jars, getting 
paid £20 a day. I would work in the day and go training in the evening.'

After a more successful spell at Stockport, he really began his rise from bloke who worked with jars to being a star when 
Rochdale boss Steve Parkin moved him from midfield.

Lambert was 23 at the time and forged a
 formidable partnership with Grant Holt and they scored 27 goals in 24 
matches

Good move: Lambert was a midfielder before Steve Parkin converted him to a striker at Rochdale

Net gains: Lambert while he was at Bristol Rovers, where his career carried on its upward trajectory

Three of Lambert's former clubs are now non-League - Stockport, Macclesfield and Bristol Rovers, who dropped down to the Conference earlier this month.

Bristol Rovers - Conference (last season 23rd in League Two, relegated)

Stockport - Conference North (2013-14 14th)

Macclesfield - Conference (2013-14 15th)

It got the striker noticed by Bristol Rovers and he moved there for £200,000.

Southampton
 signed him for £1million 
in 2009 but only became their main man after 
words of advice from former manager Alan Pardew, who told him to get in 
shape.

‘That really stuck,’ Lambert said. ‘I was overweight, basically. I wasn’t looking after my body the way I should have.’

He knuckled down and his goals have 
fired the Saints up two divisions and his Premier League exploits led to an England debut.

And what a debut. Lambert headed 
the winner against Scotland at Wembley with his first touch after barely
 three minutes on the pitch.

After scoring he said: 'I dreamed of this all my life, it means
 so much. It was a great corner by Leighton 
Baines, where I wanted it and it was great to get on the end of it.

'I've tried to play it calm all week, when all I wanted to do was scream!

'I don't mind people talking about the beetroot factory - it shows how far I've come.

'It was great to have my family here.
 I'm so happy for those who made it possible - my parents, my wife, 
three kids and Southampton. They've been different class.' 

And
 he did not stop there. Another international goal followed against 
Moldova a month later and he played a key role in a gritty 0-0 draw with
 Ukraine.

After scoring 15 
goals in his first Premier League season with Southampton, Lambert 
followed it up with 14 in the campaign just gone, enough to earn himself
 a place on the plane to Brazil.

His
 main assets include his touch, aerial ability and strength but he has 
become best known for his penalty record. Since joining Southampton, he 
has taken 34 penalties and scored every one.

Now, Lambert's career is going full circle with his move back to Liverpool, and a chance to pull on the iconic red shirt.

It will truly be his Anfield of dreams.
