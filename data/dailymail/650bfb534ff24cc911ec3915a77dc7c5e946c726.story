A fraternity at Texas Tech University has been suspended after posting a banner reading 'No Means Yes' at a party.

The sick slogan was displayed at a Phi Delta Theta party in Lubbock, Texas at the weekend, along with other misogynistic posters, including one of a woman's genitals acting as a working sprinkler.

After the images emerged on social media and fraternity websites, the chapter's activities were suspended and officials at the university said they are investigating.

'We are deeply concerned by the images provided from the alleged event,' Sean Wagner, Associate Executive Vice President, said in a post of Phi Delta Theta's website.

'Phi Delta Theta has zero-tolerance for any behavior that promotes misogyny or promotes a sexually hostile environment.. Anyone found to be directly involved in the severely misguided decision will be held accountable, and education in this area will be provided.'

It added that the event had been 'unsanctioned'.

Texas Tech spokesman Chris Cook added: 'Sexual misconduct is a serious issue, and an investigation into this incident is ongoing.'

Trey Hudgins, president of the Tech chapter of the fraternity, apologized for the incident in a statement on Tuesday, the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported.

'On behalf of the men of Texas Epsilon, I want to apologize for the inappropriate signage displayed during a social event this past weekend,' he said.

'The images and statements do not represent the values of Phi Delta Theta or the feelings of the Texas Epsilon chapter towards women. It was a terrible error in judgment. We are cooperating with Texas Tech and General Headquarters officials in an investigation regarding this matter.'

Posts about the incident have now been removed from Facebook and websites, including Total Frat Move, which first posted about the images.Â 

The fraternity was temporarily suspended in 2001 after a former member was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and intoxicated assault at a party, according The Daily Toreador.

The slogan, which reads in full 'No Means Yes, Yes Means Anal', was also used at Yale in 2011, where it sparked a major controversy when pledges chanted it as they walked around campus.

The fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon, was banned from campus for five years.

The incident appeared in a federal complaint against Yale for being 'sexually hostile', which led to an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.
