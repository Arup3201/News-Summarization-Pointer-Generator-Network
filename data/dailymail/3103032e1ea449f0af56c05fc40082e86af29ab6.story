A breast cancer survivor who underwent a double mastectomy before giving birth to her first and only child has hit back at critics for shaming her for feeding him formula.

Journalist Emily Wax-Thibodeaux, from Washington, D.C., was 32 when she was told she probably had breast cancer, and, since it ran in her family, she elected to do radiation and have a double mastectomy with reconstruction.

Due to the surgery, she was unable to to breastfeed when her baby Lincoln was born five years later - but that didn't stop mothers and nurses from pressuring her to do so.

Mom knows best: Breast cancer survivor Emily Wax-Thibodeaux, who underwent a double mastectomy before giving birth to her son Lincoln (pictured), has hit back at critics for shaming her for feeding him formula

'For me, formula has been so vilified that I felt as if I was constantly explaining my situation,' Emily writes in the Washington Post.

In one instance, while giving her then-three-month-old formula at a baby-and-me yoga class, one of the other mothers gave her the unsolicited advice: 'You know, breastfeeding is optimal.'

And a Facebook friend commented on one of her husband's photos, which showed him giving Lincoln a bottle: 'So you're not breastfeeding? It's better you know?'

Everywhere she went, women and mothers would shame her for not breastfeeding, propagating the commonly held belief that 'breast is best'.

In reality, however, recent studies have shown that breast milk may be no better for a newborn than formula.

 But when Emily sent the study to her friends, hoping to open their eyes to alternative views, one friend even offered to give her some of her own breast milk that she had frozen.

'The irony, of course, is that women who breastfed in the 1970s say they were judged for being crunchy Earth mothers by those who gave the bottle,' writes Emily.

'Now they are considered mainstream and judging formula feeders. Can’t we all just get along?'

Emily explains that the first instance of formula shame occurred in the hospital the day Lincoln was born.

Even after the new mom told the lactivists who came to her hospital room that she was going to use formula, they insisted: 'You really should breastfeed.'

The angered mother recalls: 'So, holding my day-old newborn on what was one of the most blissful days of my life, I had to tell the aggressive band of well-intentioned strangers my whole cancer saga.'

Unsolicited advice: On one instance, a Facebook friend commented on one of her husband's photos, which showed him giving Lincoln a bottle: 'So you're not breastfeeding? It's better you know?'

One nurse persisted even after hearing Emily's story, telling her: 'It may come out anyway, or through your armpits.'

But when she consulted her breast surgeon Shawna Wiley, who works at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, she told her that the goal of a mastectomy is to remove as much breast tissue as possible. As such, 'There should be no milk production,' explained the nurse.

What's more, pressuring a mother to breast feed when she cannot or doesn't want to - especially after a traumatic experience like cancer - can have negative effects. 

'I think that women who have made the difficult decision to have bilateral mastectomies have already grieved the loss of not being able to breast feed,' she says. 

'No group should make a woman feel guilty about the decisions she made . . . or make her feel inadequate about not being able to lactate.'

Unneccessary: 'For me, formula has been so vilified that I felt as if I was constantly explaining my situation,' Emily writes

Emily is not alone in her frustration; when she sent the study to her friends, some women responded that they, too, have been made to feel ashamed for not breastfeeding.

'Some women shared that they wished they could stop breast-feeding so they could leave the house for more than three hours at a time. Or so the father or grandparent could give a bottle. Or because it hurt,' she writes.

'Or because they needed to work and couldn't spend long breaks pumping. Or because they adopted their child and couldn’t. Or because they just didn’t want to.'

And reactions to her article have been mostly positive, with one fellow parent calling it a 'powerful' story.

Another person commented: 'Thank heaven people are finally coming to their senses about breastfeeding. Women my age have put up with listening to this bunkum about the superiority of breast feeding for 40 years and it's really getting old.'

And a third commenter agreed: 'Thank you for this article. I too am sick of the lactivists pushing their agenda down everyone's throat. Why the HELL is it any of their business?'
