If you've ever wondered what it would be like to be Superman, this incredible footage will give you a fair idea.

A team of internet video producers have created a stunning visual montage of Superman soaring through the suburbs of LA in America.

They attached a GoPro camera to a flying drone and then combined the footage with a few staged scenes and some digital wizardry to create the three minute, 17 second clip.

Ready for action: The three minute, 17 second clip starts with Superman getting ready to go on a mission

Mission: Superman decides to return a lost GoPro camera to its rightful owner

And he's off: The footage then captures Superman soaring into the air on his way to return the camera

Digital wizardry: The clip was created by a three-man team from Corridor Digital who attached a camera to drone and then combined the footage with some staged scenes and technical trickery

It follows Superman on a mission to return the lost GoPro camera to its rightful owner.

But on his trip, he gets waylaid, having to take down two armed criminals and rescue Lois Lane from a burning building before he can finally deliver the item to its stunned owner.

The three-man team behind the video - Sam Gorski, Niko Pueringer and Jake Watson - specialize in dreaming up sci-fi action YouTube videos through their company Corridor Digital.

Under fire: Superman's mission is then interrupted by two gun-wielding baddies. While the weapons are real, the gun fire was added afterwards

Fighting crime: Superman then takes out the criminals one by one

After tackling the baddies, Superman continues on his mission. The Corridor Digital team added Superman's arms during editing

Superman to the rescue: The superhero then comes across a burning building and a women screaming for help

Dramatic: Superman then sweeps Lois Lane into in arms before taking her safety. The team used a green screen to film Lois 'flying' with Superman'

'Thank you Superman': He then places a very grateful Lois Lane safely on the ground before soaring off to continue his mission

They used the drone to capture footage of Superman soaring through the air and then added the superhero's arms while editing.

But the scenes where Superman takes down the baddies and rescues Lois Lane were filmed by one of team who had attached the GoPro cameras to his head.

The two lots of footage were then combined with a few digitally-created explosions added along the way.Â 

Final destination: Superman spots the house of the camera's owner and comes in to land

Mission completed: He then hands the camera's stunned owner Sam Gorski, who is one of the Corridor Digital team, his GoPro back

Changing perspectives: Sam Gorski takes his camera back and catches a close-up glimpse of Superman on film

Superman then soars off into the air to help others in need - leaving a huge crater in his wake
