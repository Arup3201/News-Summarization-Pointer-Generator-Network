Gus Poyet was left to round on referee Kevin Friend and the media after a dismal performance at Bradford followed hot on the heels of Tuesday night's Premier League capitulation against QPR.

Sunderland went down 2-0 against the League One side, who unceremoniously dumped them out of the FA Cup.

Poyet clearly took issue with the reporting of his comments about the club's fans, telling the post-match media conference: 'The problem is you, not me.

Sunderland manager Gus Poyet thinks the media is causing problems for his team after losing to Bradford

'I'm not going to get involved any more. If we close Sunderland - if we put a China Wall around the city - it would be fantastic.

'Now when we let you in and you get out and say what you want we've got a problem. I invite every Sunderland fan and people around the club not to listen to any one of you - only to me.'

Poyet even took issue with a question about the absence of Jermain Defoe, responding: 'You need to know too many things and we try not to give you too much information.

'He was injured, he got a little problem on his calf and we don't know how long it is going to take.'

Poyet's mood was not improved by his reaction to the performance of Friend, whom he believed denied Sunderland a clear first-half penalty after Rory McArdle tackled Steven Fletcher in the box.

Poyet added: 'We tried our best and I think no regrets because everybody put in their best effort and their best ability to play under the circumstances.

'They found a goal from an action that can happen in any game. Then when we started understanding a way to hurt Bradford, at that moment we needed to score and the referee needed to do his job and he didn't.'

However, Poyet did refrain from following up his comments earlier this week about the poor state of Bradford's pitch - and was magnanimous in his praise of the League One side's performance.

He added: 'I'm not going to complain about the pitch - we didn't lose because of the pitch.

'Bradford won at Stamford Bridge on a great pitch and today they played here and beat us on this pitch so you need to give plenty of credit to what they do.'
