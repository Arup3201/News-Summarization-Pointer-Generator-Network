When the ironically named Tiny the cat arrived at the Fredericton SPCA in New Brunswick, Canada, last December, the feline clocked in at heart-stopping 30.2lbs.

Last week, however, the once-hefty kitty reached an important milestone when it was announced that he lost more than 10lbs thanks to a strict diet.

According to LeeAnn Haggerty, the director of education and training at the Fredericton SPCA, it took a lot of hard work to bring Tiny’s weight down to the more reasonable 19.11lbs.

Fat cat: When Tiny arrived at the Fredericton SPCA, he weighed in at 30.2lbs, or about three times the size of an average house cat

‘When he came to the shelter, we knew this weight was a medical emergency, really that obesity in pets can be fatal; his weight was quite a concern,’ she told CBC News.

Tiny, who at that point was about three times the size of an average house cat, was taken to Dr Nicole Jewett at Valley Veterinary Hospital, who created a special calorie-controlled weight-loss plan for him at a foster home.

Baby steps: Initially, Tiny would hardly walk, and even swatting at a feather wand would wear him out

Despite the impressive results, however, Tiny’s journey is far from over. The goal is for him to shed another two-four pounds.

The drastic weight loss has been accompanied by a significant improvement in Tiny’s appearance and well-being, according to his veterinarian.

When the pet first arrived at the center, his coat and eyes were dull, and he could only make a few steps at a time before he would have to lie down.

Thanks to his new svelte physique, however, Tiny has become more playful and active. 

‘He runs, he plays — it’s amazing,’ Haggerty said.

Another
fringe benefit that came as a result of Tiny’s impressive slim-down is 
popularity. One of his fans even created a clothing line for the 
celebrity kitty.

Breakthrough: On January 24, Tiny weighed in at just under 28lbs after shedding more than two pounds

Shedding pounds: Thanks to eating right and being more active, Tiny lost about 6lbs from his starting weight

On track: With his weight melting away, Tiny's coat became shiner and he started getting playful again

Getting trim: On June 12, The once-grossly overweight feline dropped to impressive 21.13lbs

Tartan fabric was sent to the SPCA with which they make signature Tiny ties and sell them on the site Etsy.com to raise medical funds for animals.

According
to Haggerty, about 40-60 per cent of North American pets are 
overweight, and in cats, it can lead to diabetes, arthritis, organ 
issues and even death.

Since January, the SPCA has raised about $5,700 through tie sales and donations to help sick pets in need.

Force for good: The SPCA created signature Tiny ties, which they sell online to raise medical funds for animals 

Milestone: On August 16, Tiny reached an important benchmark when he was weighed in at 19.11lbs

When Tiny reaches his goal weight, the SPCA plans to organize a party for the occasion.

It is likely that Tiny will permanently remain in the foster home where he has been staying since the beginning of his weight loss program.
