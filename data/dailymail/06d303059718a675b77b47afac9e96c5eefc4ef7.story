A massage parlour receptionist accused of having sex with Wayne Rooney told him to leave 'before he 
was destroyed and his career was over', the Old Bailey hacking trial heard yesterday.

Patricia Tierney, 58, denied being paid to sleep with the footballer in a 
Liverpool brothel in 2004, following a series of stories about Rooney's 'suggested 
use of prostitutes', the jury was told.

The mother-of-seven said in a statement she was worried about the Manchester United striker's future when he visited a second time, and urged him to flee.

Patricia Tierney, 58, told the Old Bailey in a statement she pulled Wayne Rooney into a room and

‘This incident, which is not true, was alleging I had a sexual encounter with Wayne Rooney and that he paid me for sex on a particular night when I was working at a massage parlour,' she said.

'I do recall Wayne Rooney visiting with a number of other males. Several days later he came on his own.

'This
time I pushed him into a room and told him to pull his hat down and get
out before he was destroyed and his career was over.'

The News of the World's £100,000-a-year hacker Glenn Mulcaire was investigating Wayne Rooney at the time, and Ms Tierney's name and date of birth were found in his notes, the court heard.

Paperwork at his home also revealed that Wayne Rooney's mobile phone password was Stella Artois.

A computer download named 'Project Patricia Tierney' was also discovered.

'I believe this is in relation to the 
incident at the massage parlour', Ms Tierney said, adding: 'I was offered 
£30,000 for the story but I refused.'

The phone hacker's notebooks also contained information with details relating to Rooney's mother, the court heard.

At
a later date he made a note of the mobile phone details of a Harrods 
beautician called Laura Rooney.

Last week it emerged that she was targeted solely because they mistakenly believed she was related to Manchester United and England forward.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the jury: ‘Laura Rooney was phone hacked because they thought she was related to Wayne Rooney, who was also phone hacked.

‘She wasn’t, she was not related to Wayne Rooney and has nothing to do with him.

‘She is a hairdresser who does not know Wayne Rooney but found herself being investigated just in case she did.’

Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire; ex-spin doctor Andy Coulson, also 45, from Charing in Kent; former NotW head of news Ian Edmondson, 44, from Raynes Park, south west London; and the tabloid's ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, from Woodford Green, Essex, are all on trial accused of conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.

Former NotW and Sun editor Brooks is also accused of two counts of conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office - one between January 1 2004 and January 31 2012 and the other between February 9 2006 and October 16 2008 - linked to alleged inappropriate payments to public officials.

She faces another two allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice - one with her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 49, from Chelmsford in Essex, between July 6 and 9 2011; and a second with her husband, Charles Brooks, and former head of security at News International, Mark Hanna, and others between July 15 and July 19 2011.

Coulson is also facing two allegations that he conspired with former NotW royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, from Addlestone in Surrey, and other unknown people to commit misconduct in public office - between August 31 2002 and January 31 2003, and between January 31 and June 3 2005.

The trial continues.
