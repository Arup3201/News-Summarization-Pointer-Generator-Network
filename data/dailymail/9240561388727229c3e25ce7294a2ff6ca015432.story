A newlywed bride suffered 'horrific' life-changing injuries after being run down by a car - on her honeymoon.

Beautician Joanna Rose was celebrating her marriage to Andrew after jetting off for a relaxing break in Torrevieja, in south-eastern Spain.

But after being hit by the car and thrown into the air, she was left fighting for her life in hospital with multiple and serious injuries, including a fractured spine.

The 38-year-old beautician also suffered five broken ribs, internal bleeding, cuts and bruising to her face, head and body and, due to the force of the impact, one of her crowns in her mouth became dislodged.

After the accident Mrs Rose was rushed to a hospital in Torrevieja, where she stayed for two weeks before being transferred back to the UK to Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

She is now at home in Wakefield and has to wear a full body brace and faces surgery to insert pins in her spine to stabilise it.

The mother-of-one  said: 'I feel like I have been to hell and back - my honeymoon was completely ruined as I spent the entire two weeks in hospital battling for my life.'

The 38-year-old recalls hearing a screech of tyres and a loud bang, he then turned round to see his new wife flying through the air and hitting the windscreen of the car before she fell to the floor.

Mrs Rose said: 'Andrew and I were walking along a road when the accident happened. I remember hearing a loud bang behind us then suddenly landing on the road with a thud and feeling instant and excruciating pain in my back.

The beautician (pictured looking up at her new husband on their wedding day) revealed that the 'happiest time in my life so quickly turned into the worst'

'I was rushed to a local hospital where I was told that I had fractured my spine, over the next few days I realised the full extent of the injuries I had suffered as I was in agony.

'The doctors were concerned that I had a tear in my heart due to the force of the impact and my internal injuries, but thankfully I didn't need to have heart surgery.

'I was terrified, everything happened so quickly and I can just remember being in a tremendous amount of pain. I'm so glad Andrew was there by my side at the hospital to reassure me.

'I have been struggling to cope with what has happened, the happiest time in my life so quickly turned into the worst and now I am faced with the daunting prospect that I have a long way to go before I will have fully recovered.'

The couple have a four-year-old daughter Poppy who was also on holiday with them at the time, but luckily was back at the hotel being looked after by her grandmother.

Now Mrs Rose has instructed specialist International Personal Injury lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate the accident and help provide funds for her recovery and rehabilitation.

Philip Banks, representing her, said: 'This was a horrendous accident which happened on what was meant to be a romantic and carefree holiday for Joanna and Andrew to start their married life together.

'But instead Joanna has been left seriously injured and is facing a long and painful recovery and will be unable to work for the foreseeable future.

'We are currently making investigations as to any criminal proceedings which are being conducted in Spain against the driver and to establish insurance details of the driver to help with Joanna's case.'
