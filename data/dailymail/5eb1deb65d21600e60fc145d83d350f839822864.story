A nine-year-old Michigan girl has set a Guinness World Record for hula hooping – and it’s not her first trip into the record books.

Mridula Shanker, of Ann Arbor, set the record this week by completing 166 hoop rotations in the arabesque pose in just one minute. The young girl also holds another hula hooping world record, one she achieved by breaking a previous record she had set.

The arabesque pose is a gymnastics move that requires a person to lift their leg in the air behind them with their arms at their sides.

Practice makes perfect: Mridula Shanker practices hula hooping for as much as an hour every day

‘It’s a gymnastic position – you have to lift your leg and extend the hoop on the leg you’re lifting, ninety degrees,’ she explained to CBS Detroit.

The impressive fourth grader didn’t hesitate to boast when speaking to local media.

‘I like to hula hoop and break records,’ she told the station.

Her proud father told the station she routinely reaches goals she sets.

Though likely difficult for the average boy or girl, Ms Shankar laughed off the pose, giggling as she told the station that ‘it’s kind of easy.’

The first record set by Ms Shanker was for the fastest hula hooping around the waist while hopping on one foot, according to CBS Detroit. She did it an astonishing 215 times, according to the Guinness World Records website.

Amazingly, in setting the new high watermark for the challenge, she broke her own record of 209 rotations set only months earlier.

The world-class hula hooper told the station that watching YouTube and practicing as much as an hour a day rounded her into form.

She's also attempted to set records for both the most forward and backward rolls in one minute, as well as the most M&M's pretzel candies lined up in 30 seconds.
