A last-gasp equaliser from Martin Skrtel stole a point for Liverpool against Arsenal on Sunday. 

Philippe Coutinho had opened the scoring for the Reds, but goals from Mathieu Debuchy and Olivier Giroud looked certain to secure three points for the visitors.

But Skrtel's header in the dying moments rescued a point for Brendan Rodgers' side. 

Sportsmail's Dominic King was at Anfield to rate the players' performances.

Liverpool (3-4-3)

Brad Jones 6

Had been competent until the final moment of the first half when failing to react quickly enough to Debuchy’s header

Kolo Toure 6

Arsenal’s supporters sang his name for being part of the Invincibles; Arsenal’s players passed around him for the second goal

Martin Skrtel 7

Outmuscled by Debuchy for Arsenal’s first goal; received a nasty gash on his head after being stood on by Giroud then capped an eventful afternoon with the equaliser 

Martin Skrtel will take the majority of headlines after his last-gasp equaliser for Liverpool

Mamadou Sakho 5.5

Never get the impression he is comfortable with the ball at his feet; questions over him for Giroud’s goal

Jordan Henderson 6.5 

Has the attributes to play as a wing-back with his boundless stamina; used the ball sensibly

Lucas Leiva 7 

Made his fair share of tackles and his work was relentless, came close to getting a goal with two efforts in the second half

Steven Gerrard 7

Tried to raise his team-mates when they went behind; went close with one diving header at 1-1 and another fierce drive

Lazar Markovic 7 

The Serb’s best game for Liverpool by some distance; never stopped working and made his presence felt in the final third

Lazar Markovic had his best game in a Liverpool shirt by a long way - he never stopped working

Adam Lallana 6

Made an encouraging start, including one shot that fizzed over the bar, influence tapered but his corner led to Skrtel’s goal

Raheem Sterling 7

Liverpool’s brightest player, his pace and intensity ensured that Arsenal’s defenders never had a moment’s peace

Philippe Coutinho 7.5

Much more like what you would expect from the Brazilian, took his goal confidently and his passing kept Liverpool on the front foot

SUBS

Borini (for Markovic 74min), Lambert (for Toure 81min)

UNUSED

Mignolet, Enrique, Moreno, Manquillo, Can

MANAGER

Brendan Rodgers 7 

Kept making tactical switches as his team trailed and eventually he got his rewards

ARSENAL (4-3-3)

Wojciech Szczesny 6.5

His influence grew as the game progressed, one flying stop to deny Fabio Borini’s header the pick of his work

Wojciech Szczesny grew into the game, and made a number of saves to keep his side in the match

Calum Chambers 6 

In the future he will be a central defender and, playing as a right-back, he can look awkward. Liverpool never took advantage

Per Mertesacker 6

Sterling’s change of pace caused him a few uncomfortable moments but did make some crucial blocks

Mathieu Debuchy 6.5

Tied up in knots by Coutinho for Liverpool’s opener, atoned almost instantly with the equaliser

Kieran Gibbs 5.5 

Had his head in his hands at the final whistle and rightly so; he came off the post and Skrtel was able to equalise

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 5

Promising start but didn’t have as much an influence as player of his quality should have done

Mathieu Flamini 6.5

Lucky not to escape a red card in the first half; showed controlled aggression and discipline after the break

Santi Cazorla 7

The longer the game went on, the better he was; excellent work down the left creating Giroud’s goal

Santi Cazorla was the pick of the Arsenal team; in particular his assist for Olivier Giroud was excellent

Alexis Sanchez 6.5 

Didn’t produce a display to haunt Liverpool but his class was obvious and he won the free-kick that led to the equaliser 

Olivier Giroud 6.5

Mixed bag from the Frenchman but made the most decisive contribution with confident finish through Jones’ legs

Danny Welbeck 5.5 

Never looked like threatening Liverpool’s goal; worked hard but no end product

Olivier Giroud had good and bad spells against Liverpool, but scored with a decisive finish past Brad Jones

SUBS

Coquelin (for Giroud 82min) Monreal (for Oxlade-Chamberlain 90min), Campbell (for Sanchez 90min)

UNUSED

Martinez, Podolski, Walcott, Maitland-Niles

MANAGER

Arsene Wenger 6.5 

Can’t be blamed for one of his players switching off and his team squandering two points
