Victim: The slain doctor was identified as Ronald Gilbert, who was a urologist in the building

A doctor has been gunned down inside an examination room at his Southern California medical office where the suspected shooter surrendered to cops.

Police received reports at about 2:45pm of six or seven shots fired at the medical office near Hoag Hospital in Orange County, Newport Beach police spokeswoman Kathy Lowe said.

Officers responding to a call of possible gunshots found a man dead from multiple bullet wounds to the upper torso in a patient examination room on the building's second floor, Lowe said.Â 

The Daily Pilot identified the slain doctor as Ronald Gilbert, a respected urologist who specializes in sexual dysfunction, vasectomies and bladder and prostate cancer.

Dr Gilbert is also the founder and chief scientist at Absorption Pharmaceuticals LLC, the makers of a drug called Promescent, which is dedicated to curing premature ejaculation.

Dr Gilbert is married and the father of two sons.

Becky Calderwood said she works two 
doors down from the office where the shooting took place, and said the 
gunman was a patient.

'I sit right at the front desk, I would have caught the first bullet,' Calderwood told the Los Angeles Times.

Inside the examination room, officers found the shooter, who surrendered and was taken into custody.

The identity of the gunman was not revealed.

The building includes physician's offices, outpatient services for the hospital and a treatment center for diabetes.

No one else was injured or targeted, Lowe said.

'It does appear to be an isolated incident,' she added.

A gold Kia Sedona minivan in the parking lot was taped off and being guarded by a police car.

Detectives were interviewing employees and patients inside the building.

The
building and much of its parking lot were cordoned off with police tape
and surrounded with many police vehicles several hours after the 
shooting.

Kristen Cotty, who works as an office
supervisor at a lab on the third floor, said she thought the gunfire 
was construction noises.

'What's going on with the world 
today?' she told the Orange County Register. 'I mean, schools, now I got
to worry about going to work. This has got to stop.'

Dr Gilbert is described in a bio on 
the Orange Coast Urology website as a 'people person' who 'treats his 
patients as if they are members of his own family.'
