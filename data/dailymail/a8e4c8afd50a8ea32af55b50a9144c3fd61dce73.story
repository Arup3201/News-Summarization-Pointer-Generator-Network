Norman Mailer once likened Mohammad Ali to the Prince of Heaven. Some of the articles about Susie Wolff, the Williams test driver of all things, have been only moderately less gushing.

She has been described by the Telegraph as the fastest woman in the world. The writer of that phrase may have taken her lead from a documentary of the same name about Wolff. That documentary was made by David Stoddart, who just happens to be Wolff's brother.

I do not know Wolff at all. A friend of mine is a friend of hers and I am assured she is a nice woman. But it would be idle to deny that the hype has overtaken the reality in the projection of her as a future Formula One race driver. The evidence simply does not support the notion. To suggest otherwise is not only an insult to people's intelligence but to several drivers of greater promise.

A few facts. She is not the fastest woman in the world. Danica Patrick is way ahead of her. Patrick's victory in the 2008 Indy Japan 300 is the only win by a woman in IndyCar series history and her third place at the Indianapolis 500 is he best finish by a woman.

Wolff has never won a race in a car, as opposed to a kart. In DTM she has finished the season in 17th, 20th, 18th, 16th and 13th places and twice been not classified. She competed in Formula Renault and Formula Three for five years without any particular distinction.

By contrast, James Calado, another Britain, finished second in the F3 Championship, second in GP3 and third in GP2, yet he is racing in sports cars after failing to cut the mustard in Formula One testing.

Why then is Wolff Williams' test driver? Could it be anything to do with the fact her husband, Toto Wolff, became a director there in 2009? Surely not. (In passing, how can Mr Wolff be a shareholder at Williams and executive director at Mercedes?)

Despite her lack of experience in an F1 car – one straight-line test and day in the young driver test at Silverstone last year – Wolff, 31, continues to make her case for a race seat and will, ludicrously, drive in practice sessions during grands prix weekends at Silverstone and Hockenheim this season.

'I focus on performance because once I put my helmet on it doesn't matter what I look like,' she said recently.

'If I don't perform I'm out. 'I'm not on a crusade to prove women deserve to be here. I'm on a crusade for Susie Wolff. I just want to be the best racing driver I can be. If I can break down barriers as well as help people, I will.'

I wish her luck. I merely register my belief that the Susie Wolff story is primarily a publicity stunt.

Chequered flag: But it is debatable whether Wolff deserves her place

Those of us who believe in the rule of law – as opposed to anarchy – respect the FIA's role as the policemen of Formula One.

So logic says we should hail the judges' decision to reject Red Bull's appeal against Daniel Ricciardo's expulsion from the Australian Grand Prix and instead support the FIA's right to determine what the rules are.

But I am not sure it is as simple as that. Red Bull claim, quite convincingly I think, that the FIA's fuel sensor was unreliable and that they, in fact, were not breaking the fuel-flow limits.

The FIA's authority surely depends on their enforcing the law fairly and correctly. Otherwise what legitimacy do they have?

Unlucky: Red Bull had a case with Daniel Ricciardo's appeal

Seeing McLaren's de facto team principal Eric Boullier piling suitcases full of car parts nose high on several airport trollies this weekend reminded me of a nickname given to his predecessor, Martin Whitmarsh.

Max Mosley, then the FIA president, disparaged Whitmarsh as 'the bag carrier', for supposedly lugging around Ron Dennis's briefcase.

Speaking of Whitmarsh, I understand he is still in the process of agreeing his severance package. It is likely to be around £6million, a quarter of a million for each of the 24 years he was at McLaren.

Factoring in that his final salary at McLaren was £2.5m, that's quite some compensation for Mosley's cutting remark.

Seeing as the smog in Shanghai is in your face – not to mention possibly creeping into one's lungs – it would seem a somewhat futile exercise to blank out coverage of the problem.

Yet type 'Shanghai' and 'smog' into Google over here and it is hit and miss whether the related stories are accessible.

On Thursday, next to none would open up. Friday, they would. Is this some form of half-baked censorship?

That suspicion would be abated if the 'official' figures measuring the micrograms per cubic metre were not markedly lower than those issued by the US Consulate. Whatever the criteria, there is a gas mask in my hotel room.

Difficult to breathe: The smog in Shanghai has hardly been mentioned by officials

Mercedes are wary of having their image tarnished by association if Bernie Ecclestone's criminal trial, which starts in Germany next week, should find him guilty of bribery. They cite 'compliance', referring to a European law about probity in company affairs.

Why then potentially damage their own reputation by covering up the fact they tried to get Red Bull banned for three races over Daniel Ricciardo's fuel-flow irregularity?

Twice they denied arguing for that Draconian punishment, only for me to see in black and white that they had repeatedly done so in a 95-page submission to the court.

This, we note, is a team that banned me from their motorhome when I wrote what was perceived as an unflattering article about Lewis Hamilton, in which I revealed that his aide-de-camp, Tom Shine, was once convicted of fraud. I am still partially banned: I can go into the motorhome and to general press conferences but not to Hamilton's Fleet Street briefings. I take this in good spirit.

I remember the jest of Nigel Dempster, the world's greatest gossip columnist. 'Writs, dear boy, are the Oscars of our business,' he said.

Bans, I tell myself, are not far behind.
