Mary Beard is favourite to front the remake of the BBC's Civilisation

Mary Beard has emerged as the leading candidate to present the BBC’s Civilisation after a host of female celebrities demanded a woman front the series.

The outspoken classicist would take on the mantle of Kenneth Clark in the original 1969 show.

Novelist Kathy Lette has recruited more than 30 household names to sign a petition encouraging the BBC to give the coveted job to a woman.

Other signatories include human rights barrister Baroness Helena Kennedy and novelists Kate Mosse.

Joanna Trollope, Jemima Khan, Bianca Jagger, Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti and Jo Brand also all signed.

Lette said a female voice ‘would ensure [Civilisation] won’t just be about History but also Herstory.’

She also put forward AS Byatt and Hermione Lee for the role.

The 13-part 1969 series is still regarded as one of the greatest British programmes ever made.

Other possibilities for the new job include Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum and Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate.

The BBC’s own presenters Jeremy Paxman, David Dimbleby and Andrew Marr are also being considered.

Last night a spokesman for the BBC declined to comment.
