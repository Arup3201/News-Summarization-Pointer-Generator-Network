A woman in Kentucky has been summoned to testify against her murder suspect wife - even though the state exempts straight spouses from testifying against each other.

The trial of Bobbie Jo Clary, who is accused of beating a man to death in 2011, is expected to become a significant case for gay rights as, although Kentucky has a spousal privilege law, it does not recognize same-sex marriages.

It means that Clary's wife, Geneva Case, has been legally subpoenaed to testify after she allegedly heard Clary say that she had killed the victim.

The couple traveled to Vermont for a civil union ceremony ten years ago.

'It's a real marriage to us,' Case told WHAS11. 'We went there and we got married. It's my right not to have to do it - everybody's right not to have to testify against their spouse.'

Clary's attorney Bryan Greenwood has filed a motion to quash the subpoena.

'Our
argument is that the constitutional amendment [banning same-sex 
marriage] is unconstitutional and the court should strike it down,' he told ABC News.

Clary, 37, faces the death penalty 
for allegedly beating George Murphy, 64, to death at his home in October
2011, but she claims she only attacked the man because he was raping 
her.

Prosecutors say she then told Case she had beaten the man to death and that Case saw blood on the interior of Murphy's van.

They added that Case should testify against Clary - and that there are no laws blocking her from doing so.

Like many states, Kentucky has a spousal privilege law exempting spouses from testifying against one another in court.

Prosecutors said that law does not apply 
to Case because she is a woman and Kentucky does not 
recognize civil unions or same-sex marriages.

Killed: George Murphy was found bludgeoned to death by a hammer. He died of blunt force trauma

In 2004, Kentucky passed a law by 
referendum that makes it unconstitutional to recognize same sex 
marriages or unions.

'Our position is that spousal privilege only applies to a
valid marriage and these two parties do not have a valid marriage,' prosecutor Stacy Grieve said.

But Gatewood pointed out in a hearing on 
Tuesday that the state recognizes other types of unions not covered 
under Kentucky law, such as common law marriages from other states.

'There's
no marriage certificate or ceremony or marriage in common law marriage,
but Kentucky recognizes it. If you're going to do it for heterosexual 
couples but not a civil union from another state, that's a violation of 
equal protection,' Gatewood said.

Supportive: An attorney for the couple said he will take the fight to the Supreme Court if he has to

He said that he was willing to fight the case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.

'It's very stressful,' Case said. 'I wish she could come home. There's nothing we can do right now though.'

The case will be reviewed by Attorney General Jack Conway and the judge will make a ruling by August 16. The murder trial is expected to start at the end of the month.
