WNBA star Glory Johnson, 24, is hunting for the perfect wedding dress to flatter her 6ft 3in frame.

The Tulsa Shock forward takes her fiancee and fellow WNBA player Brittney Griner, 24, gown shopping at Bridals by Lori on Friday's upcoming episode of Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta.

While Miss Johnson is serious about finding her dream dress, Miss Griner admits that she isn't nearly as comfortable on the bridal floor as she is on the basketball court.

The TLC show's fashion director Monte Durham notes in a clip from the episode that 'competition is in their blood', which isn't necessarily a good thing when it comes to searching for a wedding gown.

'When you bring that competition to the bridal floor, the only one who risks losing is the bride,' explains bridal boutique owner Lori Allen.

The couple, who announced their engagement last year, are joined by a small entourage, which includes Johnson's sisters.

'My sisters help me a lot with what I want to wear,' the bride-to-be explains.  

But Miss Griner struggles to find the right dress for Miss Johnson.

'What is that?' Miss Johnson asks when Miss Griner holds up a poofy gown.

'No?' Miss Griner replies. 'You know what? I am going to retry. I am going to try again.' 

As they continue to search through the racks filled with gowns, Miss Griner hypothesizes that 'the best dress will be on the mannequin because they want you to see it'. 

The Phoenix Mercury center is soon seen lugging a dressed mannequin  to the fitting room for her fiancee.

'I consider the dresses on the mannequins my all-stars,' Ms Allen later admits.

But Miss Johnson isn't so sure of her fiancee's approach to dress shopping.

All-star choice: The first dress Miss Johnson tries on is a strapless ball gown that Miss Griner had chosen

'I don't even know if they are taking it seriously,' she says. 'I'm taking it seriously. I am up there trying to find a dress.'

The first dress Miss Johsnon tries on is the strapless beaded ball gown that Miss Griner had seen on the mannequin.

'It's really pretty,' she says while modeling the dress. 

She notes: 'I am very shocked that I like the dress. I am shocked that Brittney and Jay were the ones who picked this one out.'

While viewers will have to wait till Friday to see which gown Miss Johnson thinks is the one, Ms Allen says dressing the basketball star was not as she 'had envisioned'.

'I expected this fabulous athlete - who would not really want to look like a traditional bride,' she says. 'I'm thinking maybe a pants suit? Boy was I wrong.'

Miss Allen explains: 'Ultimately Glory was very traditional and was only interested in pleasing Brittany - like most other brides. This is why I love bridal. It keeps you on your toes. In the end, Glory looked glorious - no pun intended.'

Although bridal gowns are not in her area of expertise, Miss Griner says: 'Being on the show is super exciting.'

'I was nervous, but I knew at the end of the day we would have a dress,' she notes. 'It also let me know how real things are. When I saw Glory in her dress I just couldn't keep the tears back.'
