One in eight motorists have suffered damage to their cars from neglected roads and potholes in the past two years, with millions of pounds being paid out in compensation by cash-strapped councils.

The one in three local authorities that responded to a nationwide survey revealed that they had paid out £4.8million after claims by drivers following two harsh winters.

With data lacking from two out of three councils, this means the compensation bill for this period could well be up to £15million.

Cash-strapped councils are paying out million of pounds in compensation to drivers who claim their vehicles have been damaged by potholes

Surrey County Council alone has spent more than £630,000 of taxpayers’ money since 2010 on 3,650 payouts to motorists for vehicle damage caused by neglected roads and potholes.

Britannia Rescue issued Freedom of Information requests to 434 city, district, borough and county councils.

Some 143 responded with at least one 
piece of data, while 291 are either yet to respond, said that they did 
not keep the data, or that they were not responsible for road 
maintenance in  their area.

Since 2010, more than 54,000 compensation claims have been made to the councils in Britain that supplied figures to the survey.

Warning: The combination of a wet summer and a cold winter has particularly harmed road surfaces

The claims ranged from potholes ruining wheel rims to punctured tyres and damaged suspension between 2010-11 and 2011-12.

The combination of a wet summer and a cold winter has particularly harmed road surfaces, with potholes forming after water seeps down below the road surface and freezes, loosening the asphalt.

According to the data, the average repair bill is £132, with some claims as high as £3,000.

At the same time, the average cost of repairing a pothole is around £50, meaning the amount paid out by councils in compensation could have been used to repair more than 96,000 potholes.

Road maintenance is severely under-funded with estimates that just £17 per driver is spent on maintaining road surfaces and fixing potholes – amounting to 11 per cent of the annual road tax bill.

Peter Horton, managing director of Britannia  Rescue, said: ‘The past two harsh winters caused  significant damage to the UK’s roads, which has not been fully repaired yet.

‘Cuts in road maintenance funding mean that local authorities face very difficult choices on the roads they prioritise for repair.

Motorists should protect themselves by keeping an eye out for potholes and keeping speeds down, particularly in wet weather when holes may be filled by rain.’
