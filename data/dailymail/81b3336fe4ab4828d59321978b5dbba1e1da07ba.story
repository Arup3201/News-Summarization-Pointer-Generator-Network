Facebook has suffered a serious blow to its glittering reputation when its share price slumped by more than 10 per cent in just two days of trading since the firm's landmark IPO last Friday.

And the pain could continue for the social network, as many analysts predict its value will continue to fall in the wake of the much-hyped but shambolic initial public offering of 421m shares.

It means Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who made $19bn on Friday has since lost $2.055bn in the three days since.

One market expert even said there was 'no reason' to invest in the company, claiming that jumping on the Facebook bandwagon would be like 'catching a falling knife' - and that there would be 'no bottom' for the shares.

Excitement: But Facebook's shares have fallen since the IPO on Friday

Facebook's flotation on the Nasdaq was one of the largest IPOs in U.S. history, raising nearly $20billion for the web giant.

But the hotly anticipated share offering soon fell flat, as the firm's share price ended the day just cents higher than its opening price of $38.

The price fell even further on Monday, closing at $34.03 as several of the investors, both professional and amateur, who had piled in on Friday quickly had second thoughts.

Dave Rovelli, a senior trader at Canaccord Genuity, told CNBC he would be reluctant to invest in Facebook until it had a viable long-term plan for turning its unprecedented amount of user data into profit.

'There's no bottom,' he said, noting that most major financial institutions were short-selling the shares. 'So there's no reason to jump in here. You're catching a falling knife.'

He added that the sharp fall in Facebook's share price 'leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth', and could damage the reputation of stock markets as a whole.

'We're trying to get the retail investor back on board, and everyone who bought it is getting creamed,' Mr Rovelli said.

Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group who was the first expert to advise selling Facebook shares on Friday, said he thought the company's true value was around $30 a share.

'There must have been some sober second thoughts about this,' he said in the wake of Monday's mass sell-off.

Mr Wieser added that there were 'real concerns about growth and advertisers' frequent lack of certainty how best to use Facebook'.

Some investors have managed to profit from the IPO, as the firm's share price briefly leapt up to around $45 on Friday before falling back down again.

Steve Bishop, of the RS Technology Fund, told the Wall Street Journal he sold his shares in the 'overhyped' IPO early on, as he felt the market had become 'frothy'.

The disappointing results of the IPO could deter other rising tech stars, such as Twitter, from going public and risking a similar blow to their reputations.

'It bears out why so many Silicon Valley CEOs want to stay private as long as possible - to avoid the maelstrom they’ve seen hitting Facebook over the last few days,' analyst Jed Williams told the Financial Times.

Blame: Some say Nasdaq, pictured, is responsible for the Facebook fiasco

Opinion is split over who is to blame for the slump in the share price, with some suggesting Facebook issued too many shares in the first place, and others blaming the financial firms tasked with handling the deal.

Michael Pachter, of Wedbush Securities, told the Journal: 'The underwriters completely screwed this up,' adding that the share issue 'should have been half as big as it was'.

But many experts believe that Nasdaq itself is responsible, as it failed to anticipate the trading demand, leading to serious technical difficulties and a long backlash in processing deals.

Thomas Joyce, chief executive of Knight Capital, described Friday's fiasco as 'the worst performance by an exchange on an IPO ever'.

One expert even blamed critical media coverage for Facebook's problems - a spokesman for TD Ameritrade said that negative news stories caused 'emotional trading' which depressed the share price.
