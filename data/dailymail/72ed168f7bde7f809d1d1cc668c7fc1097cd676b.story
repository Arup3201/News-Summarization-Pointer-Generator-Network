A Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) worker has been arrested on child neglect and drug charges after deputies found her six children living in 'deplorable' conditions.

Investigators received a tip that DCF investigator Kysa Donawa, 41, and her husband Randy Donawa, 38 were growing marijuana at the family home in Kissimmee and obtained a search warrant for the property.

When they got there, they found not only marijuana plants, but counterfeit money and a handgun. In addition, deputies say, the bins were overflowing with trash and there were roaches, flies and spiders infesting the house.

Arrested: Kysa and Randy Donawa are facing six charges of child neglect and drug charges

Infested: Deputies say there were flies, spiders and roaches in the children's bedrooms

Unsafe: Chemicals and medications were found open and within reach of the children

According to Click Orlando, there are six children aged six, eight, nine, 12, 15 and 17 living at the house.

Both husband and wife are now facing charges of production of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and six counts of child neglect.

Deputies said the toilets in the house didn't flush and that the smell of urine made it difficult to breath.

Cleaning chemicals were out and open and pill bottles were within reach of the couple's six-year-old.

There were 26 marijuana plants growing in the backyard.

Squalor: The couple's Kissimmee property looks tidy from the outside, but deputies say the inside is filthy and not safe for children

On Monday, a judge determined that the children would stay with their grandmothers, and that the Donawas may have supervised visits.

Kysa Donawa had worked for DCF for about a month as a child protective investigator, reports the Orlando Sentinel. She was dismissed following her arrest.

'The actions of this former employee do not reflect the dedicated employees that represent this agency professionally and positively every day,' DCF said in a statement released to the media.

Kysa Donawa told the Sentinel that she knew nothing about the marijuana plants or the harvested pot found in her home.
