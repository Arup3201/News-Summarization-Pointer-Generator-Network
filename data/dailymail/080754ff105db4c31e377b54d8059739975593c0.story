Around 200,000 fans watched the World Cup final win over Argentina at the fan mile on Sunday night and as soon as the celebrations were over the next party was being prepared.

Bayern Munich forward Mario Gotze scored the all-important winner in the second half of extra-time at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.

The result capped off a superb tournament by the undefeated Germans, who beat hosts Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final on their way to lifting their fourth World Cup - and their first since 1990.

Bayern full back Philipp Lahm became the first captain of a unified Germany to lift the World Cup, with the previous three being won by West Germany.

The squad are due to land back in Germany at 8am (BST) on Tuesday.
