A right-wing news website wrote an article last week, implying that Lena Dunham had sexually abused her little sister 

Writer and actress Lena Dunham has hit back at a right-wing news website, which published an article accusing her of sexually abusing her little sister Grace when they were children. 

Website Truth Revolt referenced an excerpt from the Girls star and creator's recently released book of non-fiction essays in which she talked about looking at her sister's vagina when Dunham was 7 and Grace was just a year old.

In 'Not That Kind of Girl' Dunham writes about her mother, famed artist Laurie Simmons, teaching her about female reproductive organs. 

Seven-year-old Lena then asks her mother if little sister Grace's vagina looks like hers. 

'I guess so, Just smaller,' her mother responds

'One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the best of me,' Dunham writes 

'Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn’t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked.

'My mother came running. “Mama, Mama! Grace has something in there!”

'My mother didn’t bother asking why I had opened Grace’s vagina. This was within the spectrum of things I did. 

'She just on her knees and looked for herself. It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there. My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled, thrilled that her prank had been a success.'

Sister, sister: The actress hit back at the Truth Revolt for turning her personal essay about childhood curiosity into something dark and disturbing. Pictured above with her sister Grace (left) at the première of her independent film Tiny Furniture in November, 2010 

Truth Revolt called the described incident 'unsettling' and 'disturbing' but Dunham says it was normal behaviour for a young child learning about the human anatomy.

The article reads: 'Lena Dunham describes experimenting sexually with her younger sister Grace, whom she says she attempted to persuade to kiss her using “anything a sexual predator might do.” In one particularly unsettling passage, Dunham experimented with her six-year younger sister’s vagina.' 

They also originally wrote that Dunham was 17 at the time of the incident, and later added a correction saying 'This article has been modified to correct a typo in the book excerpt incorrectly listing Dunham's age as seventeen'. 

Obviously upset with being named as a child molester, Dunham took to Twitter on Saturday to lash out at Truth Revolt for their damaging article three days after it was published.

The website has refused to apologize for the article, and it still appears prominently on their home page. 

Dunham is currently in London to support the launch of her book. 

The fourth season of Girls is set to première on HBO next year.
