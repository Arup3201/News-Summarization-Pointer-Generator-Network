A town centre Christmas tree has been branded the worst in Britain after it became a laughing stock among residents.

The 15ft-tall white 'tree', which looks like a piece of material stretched over a cone, was erected in Stockton last week.

Locals have since called it a 'disgrace', an 'embarrassment' and one said on Facebook that it looks like a 'dunce's hat'.

A 15ft tall Christmas tree structure on Stockton High Street has been met with derision from locals who have branded it 'pathetic' and 'an eyesore'

Anne Chivers, 64, a retired grandmother, of Stockton, said: 'It is a complete disgrace.

'It is absolutely awful. How can anyone put a thing like that up and think it is OK to pass it off as a Christmas tree?

'The lights are God awful, and it is simply an embarrassment to the town. It's like an upside down cornet.

'I will be taking my grandchildren to see the switching on of the lights somewhere else this year.

'It's the kind of thing you might put up in your garden if you wanted to annoy the neighbours. It's a joke.'

A picture of the tree has been posted on Facebook, with residents taking to the social networking website to criticise it.

Locals have branded the structure a 'disgrace' and an 'embarrassment'. One said it looks like a 'wigwam' while another called it a 'dunce's hat'

Dunce's hat: The 15ft-tall white 'tree' looks like a piece of material stretched over a cone

Kevin Parsons wrote: 'It's a wigwam hahaha.'

Mark Wilson added: 'I don't understand why they spent 1000s on fireworks and use an old dunce's hat for the Xmas tree.'

Toni Fitzpatrick posted simply: 'That's rubbish.'

Joanne Outhwaite said: 'They shouldn't have even bothered.'

A Stockton Council spokesman said: 'We're in the middle of a multi-million pound redevelopment of the High Street.

'The central and northern sections are quite literally a building site, so there's no room for our normal 40-ft high Spruce, which will be back next year.

'In the interim we've used the 20ft cone with illuminated snowflake designs, rather than leave this part of the High Street bare.

'We're pleased to report that the extensive works have not put visitors off as thousands of spectators attended last week’s launch of the Stockton Sparkles festival, which was led by 1,500 carol-singing children.

'We know that a traditional Christmas tree always makes a great centrepiece but there's so much more going on in Stockton throughout the Christmas period including our 12-day Christmas market, ice sculpture, late night shopping and street theatre with dance and musical performances.

'We would ask that our public bear with us this year and look forward to a traditional Christmas tree returning to a new-look Stockton High Street next year – we're sure it will be worth the wait!

'This year we have a cone shaped feature rather than a tree. Some people are not happy about it.'
