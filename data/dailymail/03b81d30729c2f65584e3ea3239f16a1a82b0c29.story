The father of the 16-year-old rescued in the Idaho back country after being kidnapped by a family friend who killed her brother and mother today asked for privacy so his daughter could heal from her 'horrific ordeal'.

Brett Anderson spoke for the first time since his daughter Hannah was rescued over the weekend - six days after she was abducted by James DiMaggio, who was said to be infatuated with the teen.

He thanked law enforcement officials, the media, anyone who spread the word about the teen's disappearance and the four horse back riders who tipped off authorities after stumbling across DiMaggio and his daughter last week.

Time to grieve: Brett Anderson, the father of kidnap victim Hannah Anderson, 16, speaks to the media following his return to San Diego, California, on August 12, 2013

San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said earlier this week that Hannah 'did not appear to be held against her will'

'It is time for us to grieve and move on to the healing process,' he said. 'I respectfully ask you to give us the time to allow this to happen.

'As for my daughter, the healing process will be slow. She has been through a tremendous and horrific ordeal and I am very proud of her.'

Though it has been alleged that Hannah was not being held against her will, Sheriff Bill Gore stressed today the teen was under 'extreme duress' and was the victim in the abduction.

Hannah Anderson was found on Sunday by federal agents, who were tipped off by four horseback riders who last week stumbled upon the teen and James DiMaggio.

'It is clear from the information we’ve received, that she was 
under extreme duress. She was taken out of the county, out of the state,
clearly against her will,' Sheriff Bill Gore said.

It also emerged today that DiMaggio fired at least one shot at FBI rescuers before agents killed him.

DiMaggio, 40, killed Hannah’s mother Christina Anderson and her eight-year-old brother, Ethan, whose bodies were discovered on Sunday in the suspect's burning home in eastern San Diego County.

DiMaggio was shot and killed on Saturday during the confrontation with police. Hannah was reunited with her father on Saturday.

Sheriff Gore told FOX5 San Diego: 'The kidnapper, the murderer is dead. Our focus now is getting Hannah 
all the resources, the help she needs to get through this extremely 
traumatic ordeal that she’s been through.

'Plus, let’s not lose sight of the fact that she’s lost her mother and 
her brother, which she was not aware of until she was recovered up in 
Idaho.'

The four 'hero' horseback riders 
spoke to GMA this morning about what drove them to call police after 
seeing Hannah with DiMaggio during her six-day ordeal.

Mark
John, a former county sheriff and U.S. Army Ranger, said: 'They did not
fit in with that kind of country. They were not dressed correctly and 
were extremely quiet. Hannah had a bad look about her face.'

Mark Young, who was there with his wife Mary, said: 'She had a lot of fear in her eyes.'

His wife Christa John said: 'She looked like a teenage daughter who was made to go with her dad. 
Their rucksacks were brand new.'

'She was worn out and neither of them 
wanted to talk which is unusual in the back country, usually people 
want to talk. We are just happy that everything has turned out alright.'

The two couples spoke to Good Morning America, following the rescue of the teen, who had been sharing a small tent with DiMaggio when she was found.

Their strange behavior set off alarm bells to the horseback riders.

John called the police in Idaho upon his return home, which led to the discovery of DiMaggio's car hidden by tree branches at the edge of the Frank Church wilderness trail.

Sheriff's officials told NBC San Diego that Hannah's mother Christina Anderson, recently separated from her husband, had a 'close platonic relationship' with DiMaggio.

He had an 'unusual infatuation' with Hannah, they said

Evidence: DiMaggio's car is towed away from the start of the trail where it was found on Friday

'He was like a square peg going into a 
round hole, he didn't fit,' Mr John said yesterday. 'He might have been an 
outsdoorsman in California, but he wasn't an outdoorsman in Idaho.'

The four friends are being credited with leading authorities to kidnapped Hannah and to the fugitive DiMaggio, who is believed to have murdered the teenage girl's mother and eight-year-old brother.

When Mr John noticed young Hannah and sweatpants soaking her feet in the lake he joked that she should pull her feet out because she's scaring the fish.

As he rode off down the trail, he said she could be heard remarking to herself, 'I guess we're all in trouble now.'

It's unclear what she meant by the cryptic remark. 

She appeared to try to hide her face as the riders passed, Mr John said.

Another of the horseback riders said he encountered DiMaggio and Hannah moments later and saw 40-year-old DiMaggio with his arm around the high school girl's waist.

The four horseback riders, who had been fishing the same remote late in the Idaho wilderness for years, said the entire scene made them profoundly suspicious an they talked about it throughout the night.

It wasn't until the four friends got home on Wednesday night and turned on the television that they realized the importance of their encounter.

An Amber Alert flashed across the screen, showing DiMaggio and Hannah, as being wanted by authorities in California.

'I told my wife, that is that girl we seen on the mountain,' Mr John said.

Their tip led the FBI Hostage Rescue Team to zero-in on DiMaggio's campsite. The agents rescued Hannah, who was recovered unharmed.

They shot dead DiMaggio, who was unarmed, and who had been trying to 'fortify' his remote campsite.

DiMaggio is suspected of killing Hannah's mother Christina - who thought of him as a friend - and Hannah's eight-year-old brother Ethan.

Hannah Anderson's grandparents say the identity of the man accused in her kidnapping and the murder of her mother and brother came as 'complete shock' and reveal she is expected to be hospitalized for some time.

'He was Uncle Jim. We had known him for years when Hannah was born,' Ralph Britt told NBC.

Victims: Ethan Anderson, 8, was murdered in California and his sister Hannah, 16, was abducted

DiMaggio is said to have had a 'crush' on Hannah and took her on a trip to Hollywood last year.

He mentioned this fact to the riders in an attempt to explain why he and the young girl were deep in the Idaho wilderness.

He told them, 'She got to pick where we went last year, she wanted to go to Hollywood in Los Angeles.'

The implication was that this year, he got to pick and they took a rugged camping trip.

Mr John said that the spot where the riders found DiMaggio and Hannah was a remote and deep in the wilderness.

DiMaggio had picked a spot for the tent high on a ridge that was far from the water, Mr John said.

It appeared that they had been at the site for about a day and had not had a campfire.
