Girls Gone Wild founder Joe Francis has been sentenced to 270 days in county jail, along with anger management and counselling sessions.

The charges follow his conviction on assault and false imprisonment charges.

The businessman was ordered to complete a Level 3 Anger Management course and attend a weekly session of psychological counselling for a year during the hearing in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

Francis
has also been sentenced to 36 months probation, with the judge 
expressing serious concerns about his 'explosive temper', reported TMZ.

Superior Court Judge James R. Dabney also levied $250,000 bail, allowing Francis to remain out of jail as his case goes through the appeal process.

He had faced up to five years in jail for assaulting a young woman, who he attacked while holding her and two others prisoner at his Bel Air mansion following a night out in Hollywood in 2011.

The
smartly dressed 40-year-old arrived with a wry smile on his face and 
clutching the hand of a pretty blonde, his current girlfriend Abbey 
Wilson.

After a two-week 
trial in May, a jury convicted Francis of three counts of false 
imprisonment, one count of assault causing great bodily injury and one 
count of dissuading a witness.

Despite the guilty verdict an unrepentant Francis continues to deny the charges 
and recently filed court documents demanding a new trial based on 
allegations of insufficient evidence.

However the judge dismissed the bid after hearing from both the prosecution and defence in court on Tuesday.

It
came after Francis' lawyer begged for mercy, stating that the girl's 
injuries were not as severe as claimed and disputing their version of 
events once more.

Upon leaving court Francis branded the 
sentence 'ridiculous' and 'absurd' and told TMZ: 'I'm 100% innocent and 
the evidence showed I'm 100% innocent.'

When asked if he is worried about the prospect of going to jail, Francis said: 'Right now I'm out on appeal and the appeal's process should take between two and four years. So in four years I'll let you know.'

He added: 'This is the last of this chapter guys, but thank you very much and I encourage everyone to look at the evidence and understand I did not do anything wrong, and I'll be out for four years appealing this and we will win the appeal.'

With his girlfriend in agreement, Francis also said: 'We will never be inviting random people back to our home ever again.'

Francis
met the three women as they celebrated a college graduation at a the 
Supper Club in Hollywood on January 29, 2011, took one of them by the 
hand as he left and took her to his limo, and the other two followed 
thinking Francis was giving them a ride to their car, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors
said Francis took the women to his home and a dispute broke out when he
tried to separate one from the other two, with Francis grabbing one of 
the women by the hair and throat and slammed her head into the floor.

After
an investigation, the district attorney declined to file felony charges
in the case and referred it to the city attorney, who filed the 
misdemeanor charges.

The 
case marks just the latest troubles for the once successful businessman,
whose company Girls Gone Wild is infamous for producing videos 
featuring college-age women taking off their tops.

Francis'
company, GGW Brands LLC, filed for bankruptcy in February after years 
of legal troubles, listing more than $16million in disputed claims.

Casino billionaire Steven Wynn sued Girls Gone Wild founder Joe Francis for slander for saying that Wynn had plotted to have him killed over a gambling debt from one of his casinos.

Last spring, Missouri stay-at-home mom Tamara Favazza received a $5.77million judgement after she won claims that Girls Gone Wild used video of her breasts in 2004 without her permission.Â 

The company lists a debt to Wynn's casino company of $10.3million.

In a statement, Girls Gone Wild insists the company is not broke, it is entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to re-negotiate its debts, according to Bloomberg.

'Just like American Airlines and General Motors, it will be business as usual for Girls Gone Wild,' a statement from the company said.

The company claims it has only $50,000 in assets.
