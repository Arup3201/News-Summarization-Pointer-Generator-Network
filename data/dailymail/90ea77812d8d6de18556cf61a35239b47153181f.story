He’s a Federal Liberal Party MP who represents one of Australia’s most diverse Sydney electorates and Craig Laundy has pulled no punches today by stating he is very much ‘pro-Palestinian’.

In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, he has not only made his support of the Palestinian plight in Gaza very clear but has also urged his party to change ‘alter its views’.

Mr Laundy’s electorate of Reid in Sydney is a diverse electorate, very much split along the lines of blue and white collar residents. It ranges from the affluent suburbs of Drummoyne, Five Dock and Abbotsford in the city’s inner west to Muslim dominated areas of Auburn and Lidcombe in the western suburbs.

Self-confessed 'pro-Palestinian' MP Craig Laundy says too many of his Liberal Party colleagues 'hide behind words' rather than backing a solution to the conflict in Gaza.

He told the AFR that his constituents (there is an 18% Muslim population in his area) are complaining about his party’s stance and often, suggesting that ‘they feel we have been too quiet on it (the war in Gaza)’.

Mr Laundy, who won the seat by a slender 
margin over his ALP counterpart at the 2013 federal poll, also took a 
swipe at Labor MP Laurie Ferguson, for choosing the end of the holy 
month of Ramadan to criticise Israel but claims Australia’s influential 
role within the United Nations Security Council should be used to find 
an answer to the ongoing territorial battle between the Palestinians and
 Israel.

Smoke billows from a building after an Israeli attack on a northern Gaza neighbourhood. The death toll in the region has continued to rise and up to 32 bodies were recovered from under rubble after heavy fighting in one area.

Palestinian Hamas supporters take to the streets, chanting anti-Israel slogans.

The Federal Member for Reid says both parties of guilty of ‘paying lip service’ to a possible resolution.

He is a staunch  supporter of a ‘two-state solution’.

While Mr Laundy is the only one to have spoken publicly, he does have some support from within but other Federal Liberal MPs have, so far, refused to be named.

One senior MP, however, has also admitted Labor was ‘outplaying’ the Liberal Party on the issue.

On the issue of statehood, Mr Laundy says it’s time that Australia joined forces with a growing number of representatives within the UN who are now voting ‘yes’ with Palestine.
