Known as the decade that taste forgot, the 1970s was notorious for its dodgy décor. But there is one groovy pad in California proving that perhaps its iconic patterned wall paper, shag carpets and velour furniture shouldn't be consigned to history.

Built in 1973, the Loma Vista Place in Echo Park, LA, is like a time capsule back to the era of disco, flares and space hoppers.

Featuring plastic chairs, Naugahyde and velour furniture and  endless other retro details, the decor is actually a recent creation by its current owners. The bean bags, fake fires, and foil and boldly patterned wall paper all  add to the property's quirky charm.

Groovy: Loma Vista Place in Echo Park, California proves that plastic chairs, velour furniture and shag carpets shouldn't be consigned to history

The home, built in 1973, has been lovingly restored back to the decade of disco by its current owners who have installed endless retro details down to the vintage stove

The owners, a costumer for Hollywood and her partner, spent ten years recreating the 'era that taste forgot' in a very colourful and modernised new twist

Renowned for its mismatch of patterns and colours, this green and yellow room with marble sink and green glass accessories is one of the three individually decorated bathrooms at the house

The groovy pad in California proving that patterned wall paper, shag carpets and velour furniture shouldn't be consigned to history.

Owned by a  costumer for Hollywood and her partner, they bought the property in 2005 for $550,000 and spent the next ten years transforming it into a retro palace.

It's unclear how much of the house is original; but the laminate kitchen counter-tops and the Marmoleum floors were all recent installations.  

The colourful house, which has three bedrooms and three bathrooms spread over 1,644 square feet, is on sale for $749,000.

The yellow  living room features 1970s throwbacks such as mustard-coloured shag carpets and moulded plastic shelving and furntiure

 Fake fires, bold patterns and mismatched furniture were added by the retro enthusiasts in the typical colours of the decade- yellow, orange, green and brown

The dining room and living room in the colourful house, which is over 1,644 square feet, open out onto the patio outside which has been transformed into a tiki-style area

Downstairs both the bright yellow kitchen, with its boomerang formica and vintage stove, and living/ dining room with wonderfully retro shag carpeting, open out onto a patio screened by bamboo.

Upstairs, hides a 'secret' rooftop deck featuring a hot tub which is only accessible via a ladder from a bathroom.

The hot pink Master Suite with patterned foil wallpaper includes a private balcony and walk-in closet where the homage to the era is taken to greater heights. It is chocked with paisley ties, mustard yellow and green shirts and bold accessories.

'They live like this!' the listing agents told Yahoo!

Another new installation, which appears to be of the decade, is the Dishmaster imperial Four, which gives the sink an extra vintage touch

The colourful house features three bedrooms and three bathrooms, as well as a kitchen, dining room, living room, patio area and rooftop deck

The master bedroom has its own private balcony which- of course- is completed with a 1970s-style chair and green flooring to match the walls

The garden  appears to be used as a chill-out area with furniture in a variety of colours shapes and sizes including a sofa, sun bed, garden chairs and table

The patio too is chocked full of plants and accessories while the fencing is painted in bright turquoise and green- with matching furniture

The outside area is completely shrouded by bamboo keeping the colourful and quirky décor a surprise to neighbours and passers by

The patio is not the only outdoor space however as upstairs, hides a 'secret' rooftop deck featuring a hot tub which is only accessible via a ladder from a bathroom

Upstairs is the hot pink Master Suite which includes a private balcony and walk-in closet where the homage to the era is taken to even greater heights

The  patterned curtains, different shades of pink on the walls and moulded plastic shelving, and green in the carpet, draws and chair are indicative of the era which was known for its clashing patterns

Patterned foil wallpaper was scorned after the 1970s but here in the master bedroom it looks surprisingly stylish alongside the patterned bedspread

Each bathroom was decorated in its own unique style and theme, with the pink room (left) featuring a pink toilet with matching patterned wallpaper and towel and the green room (right) with bold green tiles and glassware

The main bathroom appears to have been decorated in more of a modern style with fairly plain walls, sinks and black glossy draws

But even here, touches of the 1970s can be seen creeping in, in the areas of patterned pink wallpaper and clashing green curtains

The walk-in closet, off the main bedroom, reveals that it's not just the interior décor which the owners like to pay tribute to their favourite era, but in their wardrobe too

The closet is chocked full of with paisley or patterned ties and scarfs, mustard yellow and green shirts, bright pink and green dressing gowns and bold gold accessories and handbags

The second bedroom which features a bonus loft accessed by a bright pink ladder is currently used as an office by the retro-loving owners 

There are thousands of 1970s details all over the home, such as the wall hanging featuring 'hip' young people dancing to music with the phrase 'In and Way Out' (right) and the pink detailed bead curtain (left)

The spare room features a massive collection of Beatles memorabilia, with dolls, pictures and posters as well as a very 1970s orange carpet and inflatable cushions

The inflatable dolls of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr sit beneath quirky artwork, which appears to be homemade

The owners of the house, which is on sale for $749,000, have also amassed a large collection of music as well as other artwork and gadgets from the 1970s

Mounted in front of more foil wallpaper are two hats: a a velvet Soviet military-style one, and a fez which appears to be a sitting upon a speaker

What appears to be a retro red and black barbecue also sits on the green carpet with another of the owner's hat collection sat on top

Finishing the 1970s theme is a collection of boardgames from the era, such as Psychic Paths and Master Mind (right), and a collection of music from such as Dolly Parton
