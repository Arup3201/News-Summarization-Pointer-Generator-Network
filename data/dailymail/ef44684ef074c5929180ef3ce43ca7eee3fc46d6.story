A grieving mother has been left furious after a nurse accused of neglecting her dying son was given a warning and allowed to continue working.

Cheryl Cressey, whose ten-year-old son William died of meningitis in February 2005, reacted angrily at the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s (NMC) decision not to strike off Christopher Kirby.

William, of Croft, near Darlington, died after doctors at Darlington Memorial Hospital diagnosed a migraine and discharged him.

Mr Kirby, who was William’s named nurse, did not carry out regular observations or make notes about his condition.

He said ‘just don’t touch it’ when the youngster complained about his bulging, pus-covered eyes.

Tearful William was taken home, only to be rushed back hours later having suffered a fatal seizure.

An NMC tribunal ruled that stiffer sanctions against Mr Kirby would be inappropriate, despite his standards falling well below what was expected. 

The panel noted there is no suggestion that Mr Kirby was responsible for William’s death.

Mrs Cressey said: 'Every allegation against Kirby was proved and they just give him a warning - it is unacceptable and it is disgusting.

'They are saying Kirby was not to blame for William’s death, but if he had been checking on him, he could have given William the treatment he needed and he might not have died.'

In October, a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service panel decided not to strike off Dr Malik Alam, the consultant in charge of William’s care, despite a series of failings on his part.

The NMC decision is the latest blow to Mrs Cressey’s efforts to get justice for her son, who would have celebrated his 19th birthday next week.

She has made complaints against other nurses involved in his care and is waiting to hear whether the NMC will act upon them.

Mrs Cressey added: 'I hold every single, stinking last one of them responsible for my son’s death - they failed him completely and absolutely.

'He could have been saved, there are things that could have been done for him that weren’t.'

Summing up the NMC panel decision, chairman Polly Clarke told Mr Kirby: 'A caution is proportionate to the misconduct in this matter and will remind you to check on all patients in your care, respond to their needs as required, and not overlook any individual patient.

'While we recognise your excellent professional standing since 2005, we had to take into consideration the public interest and need to uphold the reputation of the profession.

'You ignored information from a colleague and suggested that the colleague also should not provide care to that patient.

'You failed to report observations on the patient who was in your care during the course of your shift.

'By not making records as you should have done, you deprived both clinicians and (William’s) mother of a clinical picture of how his condition progressed during your shift.'

Ms Clarke said the panel considered giving Kirby conditions of practice or a suspension, but decided these were too strong for one 'isolated' incident of misconduct.

She added: 'These charges arose from one shift in the course of a 33-year career.

'Before the shift and in the years since, you have never been subjected to disciplinary proceedings, nor have concerns been raised regarding your practice.

'You are held in high regard by your peers, and the risk of repetition of this misconduct is slight.'

The caution will remain on Mr Kirby’s file for the next five years.
