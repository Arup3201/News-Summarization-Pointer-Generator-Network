A photograph of a handcuffed teenage boy found in the possessions of an accomplice of the Candy Man has prompted concerns there is a 29th young victim, after it was found the boy does not match any records of known victims.

Dean Corll, nicknamed the 'Candy Man' 
because he gave young boys sweets from his family's business, and two 
other men, terrorised the Houston, Texas area between 1970 to 1973 
abducting raping, torturing and murdering at least 28 young males. 

Now a filmmaker has found evidence that there may be a 29th victim after he discovered a grainy polaroid of a 
terrified young boy bent over on the ground, with handcuffs on and near a toolbox 
which matches crime scene photos from inside Corll's home.

Grim discovery: A filmmaker has found evidence that there may be a 29th victim after he discovered a grainy polariod of a young boy bent over on the ground, with handcuffs on and near a toolbox which matches crime scene photos from inside Dean Corrl's home

The photo was found in the boxed-up possessions of Elmer Wayne Henley (left), who assisted 'Candy Man' killer Dean Corll (right)  between 1970 to 1973 in  
abducting raping, torturing and murdering at least 28 young males

Josh Vargas discovered the aged photo in the belongings of Corll's accomplice Elmer Wayne Henley.

Henley helped Corll in the depraved killings until he shot him after a row. 

He gained access to the Henley's belongings after he interviewed his mother to gain information for a film he was making about the killings.

She directed him to a school bus in an
overgrown field where she had boxed up all her son's possessions after 
he confessed and the boxes had not been touched for decades. 

'We were the first person who went through that stuff for forty years,' Mr Vargas told KTRK.

In a mouldy box at the back of the bus, the filmmaker found a sealed photo envelope.

'While rummaging through those pictures, this Polaroid falls out,' 
Vargas told ABC affiliate KTRK.

'I take a look at it and, right off the 
bat, having studied the case and the crime scene photos and everything, I
see Dean’s toolbox, and I see his implements in that tool box, and I 
see this kid right here with handcuffs on his arms.'

When Mr Vargas took the photo to 
Henley in prison, he said he could not recall the victim but said there 
were other young boys who had still not been identified.

Mr Vargas gave the photograph to the Harris County Medical Examiner’s 
Office, which reviewed the photograph and determined it was not of any 
of the known victims.

The filmmaker is now appealing for anyone with any information about the identity of the young boy in the photograph to come forward.

As well as finding the polaroid, Mr Vargas has also used Henley's possessions in his new film; the actor playing him is wearing his old clothing  from the bus and the posters on the film set are also from the forty year old stash.

Even if we abandon the film project today, the greatest news could get would be that at least something came of  this - maybe sand somebody may recognise their son, brother.'

Corll, along with his young accomplices, Henley and a David Brooks  were responsible for what was considered the worst mass murders the Houston areas had seen.

Corll gained the nickname 'Candyman' because he was known to give candy from his family’s business
to young boys.

The wave of killings were only halted when Henley shot him after an argument at Corll's flat.

In custody, Henley confessed to the murder spree and took the police to a bike shed where most of the victims had been buried.
