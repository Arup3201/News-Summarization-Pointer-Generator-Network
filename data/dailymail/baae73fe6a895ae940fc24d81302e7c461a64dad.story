Convicted: Angela Norman was found guilty of the involuntary manslaughter of her 14-year-old disabled daughter who only weighed 28 pounds at the time of her death

The mother of a 14-year-old girl with cerebral palsy who weighed 28 pounds when she died has been sentenced to nine years in prison.

Angela Norman, 43, was sentenced in a Dayton, Ohio court on Thursday after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter.

Her daughter Makayla Norman was covered in bed sores and showed other signs of neglect when she died on March 1, 2011, said court authorities.

The county coroner’s office attributed the teen's death to nutritional and medical neglect complicated by her chronic condition.

'She was the worst malnourished child this office has ever seen,' said Ken Betz, director of the coroner's office.

Mrs Norman was indicted on the three counts last November.

She pleaded guilty to a first-degree felony count of involuntary manslaughter and to single misdemeanor and felony counts of endangering children.

Norman remained in jail with bail set at $250,000. Her attorney did not immediately return a call to his office.

Prosecutor Mat Heck Jr. said that Angela Norman did not provide sufficient food or proper care for the child, resulting in her death.

Neglected to death: Makayla Norman had numerous bed sores and showed signs of massive malnutrition when she died on March 1, 2011, according to authorities

Three nurses who authorities said were to administer or monitor the girl's care also were charged.

Norman had been scheduled for trial April 18 with the other three defendants who have pleaded not guilty in the case.

Mollie E. Parsons, 42, of Dayton, is charged with involuntary manslaughter, failing to provide for a functionally impaired person and tampering with records.

Kathryn Williams, 42, of Englewood, and Mary K. Kilby, 63, of Miamisburg, both registered nurses, are each charged with failing to provide for a functionally impaired person and failing to report child abuse or neglect.

The teen was confined to her home and was supposed to be cared for by her mother and Parsons, a licensed practical nurse who was supposed work six days a week at the home, according to the prosecutor.

Williams was paid to supervise Parsons, visit and inspect the living conditions, and do a physical assessment of the girl every 30 to 60 days.

Kilby was scheduled to visit every six months to also check on conditions of the home and assess the girl's health, needs and care, the prosecutor has said.
