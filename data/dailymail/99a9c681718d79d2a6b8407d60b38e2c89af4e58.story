It may have a reputation for attracting some of the most discerning customers, but Marks & Spencer is less successful at reducing the stress of the weekly shopping trip.

Queues at checkouts, blocked aisles, complicated signs and staff shortages have helped put M&S bottom of a poll in which shoppers were asked how easy or difficult it was to get around food stores.

A quarter of those who took part in the survey said shopping at M&S demanded a ‘high’ or ‘very high’ effort.

The result is a potential embarrassment for M&S, whose successful advertising slogan ‘This is not just food, it’s M&S food’ has since been used to lampoon the chain.

At the other end of the scale, no-frills Iceland was rated best in terms of convenience, with 56 per cent of those polled saying shopping there demanded ‘low’  or ‘very low’ effort. Morrisons was voted second best, while Waitrose – a favourite of Middle England – was second worst.

A total of 1,000 shoppers were asked over a three-month period about how easy it was to get around the nine biggest supermarket chains.

Clean premises, helpful staff and ease of being able to find particular items on the shelves were judged to be among the most important factors in reducing the pain of the shopping experience.

Stores which confused people with too many price promotions, failed to label shelves clearly, or forced customers to wait for a long time at checkouts fared badly in the study, carried out by research agency BDRC Continental.

BDRC’s commercial director Caroline Ahmed said: ‘The main obstacle at M&S is the time it takes to complete a shop, and this isn’t helped by problems with navigation around the store and at checkout queues.’

An M&S spokesman said: ‘We listen carefully to understand what matters most to our customers.

'We know they come  to us for great quality and innovative, fresh food.’
