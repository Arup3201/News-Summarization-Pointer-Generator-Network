With shoppers queueing from the early hours and millions logging onto the internet to snaffle the best bargains, you could be forgiven for thinking the Boxing Day sales have come early.

For today retailers across Britain have slashed their prices in ‘Black Friday’ sales, offering everything from televisions to dresses, designer handbags, homewares and toys at huge discounts. 

And you don't have to brave the High Street — most retailers are offering the same discounts online as in store. Better still, many discounts will be available over the whole weekend.

Inside this exclusive guide we will tell you how to get incredible bargains, teach you how shop safely online, and reveal the celebrities' best sale buys.

Black Friday sales began as an American tradition, in which shoppers would race to snap up bargains on the first Friday after the Thanksgiving holiday. The name was coined by Philadelphia police in the Sixties after hordes of rampant shoppers caused havoc.

With the rise of internet shopping, British consumers noticed U.S. stores were offering amazing pre-Christmas deals. And then in 2010 online store Amazon introduced UK Black Friday sales.

High Street retailers quickly followed suit, and over the past two years sales have soared. Indeed, credit card company Visa predicts spending in the UK will be up 22 per cent on last year, with £1 million spent on its cards every three minutes today.

Shoppers will be thinking about Christmas presents, and there should be plenty to choose from. John Lewis, which opens its flagship Oxford Street store an hour early, has pledged to price-match discounts from competitors, as will Tesco, Mothercare, Currys, Evans Cycles and Halfords. 

Supermarkets are also offering lots of bargains, but you'll have to be quick to snap up the best ones — Sainsbury's will start its sale at 1am in its 24-hour stores, while many Tesco branches will open at one minute past midnight.

Asda, whose sales are due to start at 8am, has 700,000 Black Friday products on offer in 441 stores.

There were fights among customers last year when Asda led the adoption of the US tradition and the firm is extending its sale to two days this year.

Retailers including John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, House of Fraser and Debenhams are promising deals of up to 70 per cent off.

Some 700,000 products are being offered at knock down prices, including a 40-inch TV for £139 and an Archos tablet for just £29. John Lewis is offering a Delonghi coffee machine for half price at £595, while Marks & Spencer is launching a four-day sale with savings of up to 30 per cent.

Debenhams is selling women’s designer dresses at half price. While Tesco – which is slashing prices by up to 70 per cent – opened its branches at a minute past midnight to catch early bird shoppers.

But even if you miss deals this weekend, don't worry — on Monday retailers launch more online discounts for 'Cyber Monday', traditionally the year's biggest internet shopping day. We've got plenty of ideas in this pull-out for that day, too.

For many retailers this weekend signals the start of a sale season which will go on through to January.

All you need to do to take advantage of the next few days of deals is dust off your credit card, turn the page and get started. Happy shopping!

Bag a Black Friday bargain: Supermarkets 

Look what you can buy on Cyber Monday 

 

1. IS THE SITE GENUINE?

It should include the retailer’s name, address and email address. Check for a tiny padlock or unbroken key symbol before the web address, and be sure the address begins with https:// (the ‘s’ is for ‘secure’). Genuine firms won’t feature the names of popular items or cheap prices in their web address.

2. RESEARCH STORES

If you’ve spotted a gift from a relatively unknown company, Google it and see what comes up. Check internet consumer forums. When browsing for goods, don’t be fooled by a site ranked highly in search results.

3. PAY BY CREDIT CARD

For goods costing £100-plus, a credit card gives more protection than a debit card, prepaid card or PayPal. If an order goes astray, the goods break or the firm goes bust, you can claim from the card provider. Never pay by cash transfer.

4. SPEND £50 ON ANTI-VIRUS PROTECTION

From ‘phishing’ emails to spyware, fraudsters are adept at hacking online accounts, so get an up-to-date firewall from the likes of Norton or McAfee for £20 to £50. 

 5. PASSWORDS SHOULD NOT BE TOO PERSONAL

Avoid obvious names or dates, and try not to use the same password for all sites. To create a complex password, use a mnemonic: for example, pick a song, the year it came out, and stick a £ sign at the end. You can vary it for different websites by adding the first two letters of the site you’re visiting.

6. SWITCH OFF OR LOG OUT

Turn off a PC if you’re not using it, especially after a browsing session (a favourite time for hackers). If a site offers you a choice of storing your payment details or making a one-off purchase, go for the latter.

 7. USE A STORE’S APP

If you’re buying gifts and using your smartphone, do it on the retailer’s app rather than using the main website. A dedicated app, if available, offers greater software protection than a web browser, especially if you’re in a public place.

8. IF YOU’RE STILL NERVOUS

Choose websites that allow you to order online but pay only when you pick up the goods in person. High Street names including Waterstones, Argos and PC World now offer this.
