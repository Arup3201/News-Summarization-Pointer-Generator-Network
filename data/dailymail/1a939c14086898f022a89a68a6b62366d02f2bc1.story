This is the moment an alleged sniper and member of the pro-government forces was beaten by anti-government protestors in Kiev, as protestors took control of the presidential administration building.

As Ukrainian protesters said they had 
taken control of government offices and President Viktor Yanukovich fled the city, angry civilians kicked and shouted at members of the government, and could be seen tussling with an alleged sniper.

'He's (Yanukovich)
 not here, none of his officials or anyone linked directly to the 
administration are here,' Ostap Kryvdyk, a protest leader inside the 
grounds of the administration building, said.

Crowds of people swarmed the streets of Kiev as the under-fire president said he had no intention of stepping down, despite calls for him to give up his seat.

The turmoil in Ukrainian parliament comes as former prime minister and opposition icon Yulia Tymoshenko has been released from prison.

Protesters in the Ukrainian capital claimed full control of the city Saturday following the signing of a Western-brokered peace deal aimed at ending the nation's three-month political crisis.

They were seen demanding the resignation of their president and attacking politicians, a move which Mr Yanukovych branded 'a coup' and likened it to the rise of Nazis in the 1930s.

Viktor Yanukovych also says he has no intention of resigning or leaving the country. Hours after he and opposition leaders signed an agreement aimed at resolving the country's turmoil yesterday, Mr Yanukovych went to Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, the heartland of his support.

Today, he made the coup accusation in a televised statement.

The opposition has demanded a new election be held by May 25, as the pro-Russian leader's grip on power rapidly eroded following bloodshed in the capital.

The nation's embattled president, Viktor Yanukovych, reportedly had fled the capital for his support base in Ukraine's Russia-leaning east.

Ukraine's border guard service said that a leading governor and a mayor from the president's eastern base have fled to Russia.

A spokesman for the border guard service, Oleh Slobodyan, said Kharkiv regional governor Mikhaylo Dobkin and Kharkiv Mayor Hennady Kernes left Ukraine across the nearby Russian border.

Both are top allies of President Viktor Yanukovych, whose rule appeared increasingly under question after protesters took over the capital and parliament voted to remove him.

There are fears that Ukraine might split in two, creating a Russian-leaning east and Europe-leaning west.

Police abandoned posts around the capital, and protesters took up positions around the presidential office and residence.

Parliament discussed voting on impeaching Yanukovych and setting a quick date for new elections to end a crisis over Ukraine's identity and future direction.

Yanukovych's whereabouts were unclear 
Saturday morning. Media outlets reported that he left Kiev for his 
native eastern Ukraine after surrendering much of his powers and 
agreeing to early elections by the end of the year.

But
 despite the promise of an election and significant concessions, 
protesters blame him for police violence and amassing too many powers 
and want him ousted immediately.

At
 a special parliament session today, Oleh Tyahnybok, head of the 
nationalist Svoboda party, called for discussion of impeachment.

The parliament speaker — Yanukovych ally Volodymyr Rybak — announced resignation, citing ill health as the reason.

The
 president's representative in parliament warned against splitting the 
country in two, an outcome that worries many but is increasingly seeming
 a possibility.

The country's western regions want to be 
closer to the EU and have rejected Yanukovych's authority in many 
cities, while eastern Ukraine — which accounts for the bulk of the 
nation's economic output — favors closer ties with Russia.

The opposition have called for elections to take place on May 25 and demanded that President Yanukovych stand down immediately

The president's concessions came as part of a deal intended to end violence that killed scores and left hundreds wounded in Kiev this week as snipers opened fire on protesters. It was the worst violence in Ukraine's modern history.

Andriy Parubiy, a leader of the protest camp on Independence Square, known as the Maidan, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that Yanukovych fled for Kharkiv, the center of Ukraine's industrial heartland. Kharkiv was the capital of Soviet Ukraine from 1919-1934.

The claims of the president's departure could not be immediately confirmed, however.

A group of protesters in helmets and shields stood guard at the president's office today, with few police in sight. 

Protesters booed opposition figures 
who took to a stage last night to present their deal with the president,
 which cuts Yanukovych's powers.

"Death to the criminal!" some chanted, referring to Yanukovych.

Demonstrators at Maidan Nezalezhnosti, Independence Square, refuse to leave the square despite the agreement made between the government and the opposition

Protesters in the Ukrainian capital claimed full control of the city Saturday following the signing of a Western-brokered peace deal

A motion seeking the president's impeachment was submitted late Friday to the Ukrainian parliament, where members of Yanukovych's faction defected in droves to the opposition side, quickly passing constitutional amendments that trimmed his powers.

It wasn't clear if or when the impeachment motion would be put to a vote.

The standoff between the government and protesters escalated this week, as demonstrators clashed with police and snipers opened fire in the worst violence the country has seen since the breakup of the Soviet Union a quarter-century ago.

The Health Ministry put the death toll at 77 and some opposition figures said it's even higher.

The U.S., Russia and the 28-nation EU are deeply concerned about the future of Ukraine, a divided nation of 46 million.

The parliament on Friday quickly approved a measure that could free Yanukovych's arch-rival Tymoshenko, who has served two and a half years on a conviction of abuse of office, charges that domestic and Western critics have denounced as a political vendetta.

Legislators voted to decriminalize the count under which Tymoshenko was imprisoned, meaning that she is no longer guilty of a criminal offense.

However, Yanukovych must still sign that bill into law, and then Tymoshenko's lawyers would have to ask the court for her release from prison in Kharkiv, the city controlled by Yanukovych's loyalists where the opposition has little public following.
