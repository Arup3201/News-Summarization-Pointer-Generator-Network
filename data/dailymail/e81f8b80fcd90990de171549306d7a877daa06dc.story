It may not have all the bells and whistles as a brand new iPhone, or even look particularly pretty, but if all you want a phone for is to make calls and send texts, why not build your own?

Created by the co-founder of the Arduino platform, the wooden handset features a circuit board, a small LED display, buttons, a speaker and microphone.

It can store numbers, make and receive calls, send texts and be used as an alarm clock.

The basic phone, pictured, has been created by engineer and co-founder of the Arduino circuit board David Mellis. It features a display, buttons, speaker and microphone and can connect to mobile networks. This means the phone can store numbers, make and receive calls, send texts and be used as an alarm clock

Phonebloks is a customisable smartphone made up of what's called 'modular elements', or blocks, that can be instantly swapped and replaced.

If a battery dies, for example, a new one can be clipped into place.

Storage can be upgraded or cameras with different lenses an be swapped in and out depending on the occasion.

The designs, by Dutch inventor Dave Hakkens, were recently bought by Google-owned Motorola as part of Project Ara.

Arduino is a small open-source platform which comes with a circuit board, and software that tells people how program it. It is used to power a variety of electronic devices.

Engineer David Mellis from MIT’s Media Labs helped set up the Arduino project and has now used it to make a DIY feature phone.

Mellis has put the blueprints for the phone, as well as instructions on how to program the board on Github.

Programmers can either buy a starter pack  of basic components, or use the instructions to design and buy their own.

Mellis' version has a wooden casing that is laser-cut using plywood. It has a total of 60 components including the board, the speaker and microphone to make calls, an LED display and a SIM card holder.

The phone is powered by an Arduino GSM Shield circuit board, pictured. Arduino is an open-source platform which comes with a circuit board, and software that tells people how program it. It can be used to power a variety of electronic devices

Once the three main pieces of the DIY phone are built, pictured, they can be slotted together to make the finished phone

The particular Arduino board used in the phone is based on the GSM Shield model, designed to let Arduino-based machines access mobile networks. This also means that the phone connects to the internet so people can add their own, larger display if they want to.

The basic version can make and receive calls, text messages, store names and numbers, and display the time, however, it does not feature apps.

Github has additionally uploaded the circuit board designs to online firm OSH Park which will print three copies for around $60 (£36).

The components and circuit board are protected by a rubber sleeve, pictured, held together by small screws. The LED display is built into this protective sleeve

Mellis said the total project should cost around $200 (£121) to complete. Users will need to pay separately for a SIM card and call plan. His designs provide a framework but they can be adapted to create a range of different looking handsets, pictured

He describes the phone as ‘a difficult but potentially do-able project’ and his version only works on networks in North America. However, the phone can be adapted to be used in other countries.
