A blind Chinese activist pleaded with US President Barack Obama today to allow him to escape China.

Chen Guangcheng, the human rights lawyer who campaigned against forced abortions, begged to leave with his family aboard the same flight as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is wrapping up two days of fraught talks with Chinese officials in Beijing.

Chen, 40, said his 'most urgent wish' was to leave his homeland where he has spent the last seven years in prison or under putative house arrest, during which his captors regularly used violence against him, his family and friends.

Plea: Human rights lawyer Chen Guangcheng has asked to leave China with his 
family aboard the same flight as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

Free: Chen Guangcheng has left the U.S. embassy 'of his own volition' and was taken to Chaoyang hospital in Beijing

In a television interview Chen Guangchen made a direct plea to President Obama to help him flee China with his family

'I would like to say to President 
Obama: Please do everything you can to get our whole family out,' he 
said in an interview with CNN.

'My fervent hope is that it would be 
possible for me and my family to leave for the US on Hillary Clinton's 
plane [on Saturday],' Chen, 40, said.

Washington's diplomatic efforts to 
quell a stand off with Beijing turned into turmoil after Chen claimed he
had been forced out of the US Embassy where he had spent spent six days
after a dramatic escape from his heavily guarded farming village in 
Shandong province.

He said he doubted the validity of a 
deal brokered by the US with the Chinese government to guarantee his 
safety in China after he left the Embassy on Wednesday.

He remains under guard at the VIP 
fwing of the Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing where he arrived with US 
officials for a medical check up.

'They won't let the US officials in 
to see me,' Chen, who is now under Chinese guard on the first floor 
hospital ward, said last night.

In what can only be described as an 
act to humiliate its super power rival, Chinese official are refusing US
diplomats entry into the hospital.

US Deputy Chief of Mission, Robert Wang, has been forced to wait outside the building in an official US limousine.

'It is a very trying time,' he told the Mail before Chinese police escorted the reporter away from the hospital grounds.

Chen, who broke a foot after scaling a
wall during his escape, said he had been warned by Chinese officials 
that if did not leave the embassy, his wife, Yuan Weijing, would be 
'beaten to death' and his young family, including his six-year-old 
daughter - harmed.

Free: Chen Guangcheng's departure from the embassy came shortly after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Beijing for two days of annual strategic talks

Yuan Weijing also called on the US President to help the family flee.

'If they ever get us back home, they would put us in an iron cage,' she said.

Earlier yesterday, the US Ambassador to China Locke refuted Chen's claim he was forced out of the embassy.

Family: Mr Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, was supposedly beaten by government guards and their daughter, Kesi, was harassed

Human rights: Mr Chen (right) met with the wife of a different human rights activist earlier this month while in his home, and he supposedly planned the escape for weeks by pretending he was sick

'I can tell you unequivocally that he
was never pressured to leave. He was excited and eager about leaving 
[after Chinese officials guaranteed he would be safe],' he said.

But amid the claims and counter claims, it appeared Chen had a change of mind and is now desperate to secure sanctuary overseas.

State Department spokeswoman Victoria
Nuland told reporters that U.S. officials had spoken twice Thursday 
with Chen and also with his wife.

Still in custody: Mr Chen escaped on his own and is calling for an investigation into the treatment of his family

'They as a family have had a change of heart about whether they want to stay in China,' she said.

'We need to consult with them further to get a better sense of what they want to do and consider their options,' Nuland said.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is
due to leave China on Saturday after holding annual talks with senior 
Chinese officials on several crucial issues, including trade, Syria and 
North Korea.

China has rounded up and threatened over activists who helped Chen escape.

A Chinese Foreign Minsistry spokesman insisted Chen was a free man and that he had never been placed under house arrest.
