A judge in Tennessee who ordered a baby's name changed from Messiah to Martin has been charged with violating the state's Code of Judicial Conduct.

Child Support Magistrate Lu Ann Ballew ordered the name change during a paternity hearing in Newport on August 8.

At the time, the parents were disputing the 8-month-old baby's surname.

The boy's mother, Jaleesa Martin, hoped to keep the name she had given the boy- Messiah Deshawn Martin - and father, Jawaan McCullough, wanted the baby to bear his last name.

Ballew surprised both parents by ordering the baby's name be changed to Martin Deshawn McCullough, saying the name Messiah was not in the baby's best interest.

Her written order said '`Messiah' is a title that is held only by Jesus Christ.'

'Labeling this child "Messiah" places an undue burden on him that as a human being, he cannot fulfill,' the order said.

Ballew further stated that 'it is highly likely that he will offend many Cocke County citizens by calling himself "Messiah,"' but she carried through on the ban anyway.

That decision was overturned in Cocke County Chancery Court the following month, with the judge saying that Ballew's ruling violated the U.S. Constitution.

'I was shocked. I never intended on naming my son Messiah because it means God and I didn't think a judge could make me change my baby's name because of her religious beliefs,' Ms Martin said.

The boy is now officially called Messiah DeShawn McCollough.

The mother's two other children are called Micah and Mason and she argued that she wanted to name her third child with an M too.

Messiah is ranked 387th most popular baby name according to the Social Security Administration's 2012 list of names.

It was revealed earlier that magistrate Ballew first ruled to keep the original name but then changed the written record and held a second hearing.

On Wednesday, a panel of the Tennessee Board of Judicial Conduct filed formal charges against Ballew.

Among other things, the code requires that judges perform all duties without bias or prejudice based on religion.

Ballew has 30 days to answer the charges.
