Police are searching for two missing teens believed to be together who disappeared after reportedly threatening to hurt themselves.

Erika Rodriguez, 14, of Holiday and Caleb Bagnall, 13, of Tampa are dating and it is suspected that she was picked up in a car on her way to Tampa with him, said police. 

Bagnall, a white male, left his home near Dale Mabry Avenue and Lois Avenue on Saturday morning, and police are concerned due to his age as well as threats of him harming himself and his girlfriend, according to ABC Action News.

It is not known what he was wearing when he left his residence.

Rodriguez, a white female, was last seen at her home around 11.30pm on Friday wearing a long-sleeve t-shirt, low-top gray Converse sneakers and possibly blue jeans.

The teen girl, who also threatened to harm herself, took $200 from her mother's purse along with her school backpack before leaving her residence on Westchester Drive, according to WTSP.

She has scars on both arms, on her upper thighs and under her armpits from self-mutilation, as well as a red mole on the left side of her forehead.

Rodriguez is 5'6' tall, has auburn hair, light brown eyes and is 120lb.

Bagnall is 5'4' tall, has brown hair and is 130lb.

Pasco Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Melanie Snow said Rodriguez had moved to Tampa from Holiday about three weeks ago, according to the Tampa Bay Times. 

She said: 'We don't think that she is in danger, but she is only 14 years old and away from home on her own accord. Her mother wants her home.'
