Cooking programmes are some of the most popular on the television and now fans of foodie shows can finally satisfy their rumbling bellies as MasterChef champions offer up their dishes to the public.

The MasterChef pop-up restaurant and bar is a one-off eating experience offered to Londoners this September and October.

The exclusive dining venue will play host to previous contestants of the BBC programme, with the best chefs of the past ten years showcasing their talents over five weeks.

Mat Folas is one of the MasterChef champions who will be cooking in the Blue Fin building

Twelve MasterChef champions will be taking part, including 2014 winner Ping, as well as various other contestants and numerous and celebrity chefs.

Week one saw Ping Coombes (winner 2014), Jack Lucas (finalist 2014) and Lucke Owen (finalist 2014) take the reins.

Tom Anderson (winner 2011), Tom Whitaker (finalist 2011) and Sarah Danesin Medio (finalist 2011) were in charge on week two.

Week three enlisted the skills of Natalie Coleman (winner 2013), Matt Follas (winner 2009) and James Nathan (winner 2008). 

This week, Dhruv Baker (winner 2010), Andrew Kojima (finalist 2012) and Tom Rennolds (finalist 2012) are in charge.

Next week, Ping Coombes is back, as are Natalie Coleman and Jack Lucas.

In true MasterChef style, the restaurant aims to be innovative and keep the menu as fresh as possible by enlisting a different team of cooks every week.

The 130-cover restaurant and bar is on the 12th floor in an astonishing space with vast windows overlooking the Thames, St Paul’s and The Shard. 

It also has its own terrace with gardens that diners can enjoy during the late summer evenings.

Russell Sage Studio, London’s leading restaurant designer behind Grain Store, Dishoom, Petrus for Gordon Ramsay, The Savoy Grill and Jason Atherton’s Social Eating House will be adding his flair to create the 130-cover restaurant and the bar.

The pop-up restaurant is open for five weeks and will have a different set of MasterChef champions cooking each week

Unfortunately the restaurant is already completely sold out, with all spaces taken within just four days of tickets going on sale in July.

The restaurant has proven so popular that tickets have sold out completely

The £65 a head menu attracted so many cookery fans that the restaurant extended its opening hours for an extra week to keep up with the demand but they were snapped up too.

So, looks like we'll be sticking to looking not tasting for the time being and will be enjoying MasterChef from the comfort of our sofas.

The exclusive restaurant is not for those on a shoe-string budget with a three course dinner costing £65 a head
