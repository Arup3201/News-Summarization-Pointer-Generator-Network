The United States is carrying out the vast majority of coalition airstrikes against the Islamic State, a new Pentagon report reveals. 

The report shows that the U.S. pilots and drones have carried out 819 strikes against IS in Syria, compared to just 157 strikes from 10 ally countries, coming to 85 per cent of total strikes.

And on Sunday there were yet more reports of strikes in and around IS's stronghold city of Raqqa in northern Syria.

The U.S. partnered with Australia, France Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Canada in August to start a campaign against IS, after the terrorist group started beheading Western journalists and aid workers in televised clips.

The Middle Eastern nations of Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, also lent their fighter pilots to the effort. 

It's perhaps unsurprising that the U.S. is carrying out the majority of the missions since it is the country with the biggest military, including about 4,800 attack and fighter plains and more than 13,600 other aircraft. That's compared to just 50 fight planes operated by the Royal Bahraini Air Force. 

Though the U.S. is leading the effort, little has been released by the Pentagon about the missions, including the accuracy of the strikes. 

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe, a senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, raised questions about how effective the campaign against IS has been. 

'We need more targeting capability,' Inhofe said. 

Overnight,  the coalition carried out as many as 30 airstrikes in and near Raqqa, it was revealed.  

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the air strikes hit Islamic State positions in the northern outskirts of Raqqa city, including the 17th Division, a Syrian army base IS seized in July.

The monitoring group gathers information on the strikes from activists on the ground in Syrua, who reported at least 30 strikes.

The U.S.-led coalition began bombing Islamic State in Syria in September. Syria's nearly four-year-old civil war has continued unabated throughout the country.

The Observatory said 19 people were killed including seven women and two children when Syrian government warplanes struck the town of Jassim in the southern province of Deraa on Sunday.

Dozens of others were wounded and the death toll was expected to rise because a number were in critical condition, the Observatory said.

Fighting also continued in the Kurdish town of Kobani, northwest of Raqqa on the border with Turkey, where Kurdish defenders have been holding off an assault by Islamic State fighters for more than two months.

At least 62 people have been killed in fighting in Kobani, known as Ayn al-Arab in Arabic, since early on Saturday, the Observatory said.
