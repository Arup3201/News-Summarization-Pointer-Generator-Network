Vice President Joe Biden made quite an entrance when his motorcade pulled up to St. John's Episcopal Church on Monday morning, sporting some Top Gun-style aviators even though the sun had not fully risen.

He was accompanied by his wife Dr Jill Biden, who wore a stunning grey silk dress, and several members of his family.

Though he appeared cool and collected on Monday morning, Vice President Biden made his latest gaffe just last night as he told supporters that he was 'proud to be the President of the United States'.

Taking fashion pointers? The aviators that Mr Biden wore to church this morning were made popular by Tom Cruise who played a fighter pilot in the 1986 film Top Gun

Joking Joe: Mr Biden shared a laugh with President Obama and Senator Chuck Schumer shortly after arriving on the platform

His statement at the Iowa State Society inauguration ball was greeted at first by silence, before the crowd started to laugh and cheer as he corrected himself.

Four years after making history by becoming the first African-American president, Obama was due today to kick off his second term with a scaled-back inauguration to reflect the tempered expectations for his next four years in office.

Prepped: She wore her blonde hair loose and dangling pearl earrings

But Biden's gaffe on Saturday could be a premonition for 2016 as he hasn't ruled out the possibility that he will run for office after President Obama finishes his second term.

Even though he will be just a few days short of his 74th birthday on the next election day, Biden has hinted he is considering a run for president.Â 

Because Iowa is an early battleground in the state-by-state primaries which determine the political parties' candidates for president, any big event thrown by state officials this weekend was likely to draw at least one or two potential contenders for the White House in 2016.

Following the slip-up, Biden, corrected himself, and returned to a favorite line from this fall's campaign.

Patterned: During the luncheon Joll's dress was fully on view, and unlike Mrs Obama who normally shows her toned arms with sleeveless dresses, Mrs Biden was the one to opt for a cooler cut this time around

Sharing a laugh: Mrs Biden and Mr Obama had a giggle when they attended the luncheon in Statuary Hall

'I'm proud to be vice president of the United States,' he said, 'but I am prouder to be Barack Obama's, President Barack Obama's, vice president.'

Biden's unannounced appearance at the 'First in the Nation' ball in Washington was not too surprising.

Aside from any of his own personal 
political aspirations, the state was also key to the Obama-Biden team's 
victory over Republicans Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in the November 6 
election.

Looking away but at each other: Mr Biden ran up to many of the waving crowds and shook a few hands but Mrs Biden stayed pretty much on course and waved to admirers

Biden went on to say he had dropped by to thank Iowans for supporting the Democratic ticket in the election.

'I
came to say thank you,' Biden told those gathered at the National 
Museum of Women in the Arts, a short walk from the White House. 'Just 
simply thank you.'

Showing
appreciation to Iowa, an industrial and farm state that is home to 3 
million people, is an expected courtesy in national politics because of 
the state's role in separating contenders from pretenders in each 
presidential race.

Vice President Joe Biden has hinted he could intend to run for president in 2016, when President Barack Obama's second term will come to an end

In early 2008, the results in the Iowa caucuses convinced many Democrats that Obama could win the Democratic nomination over former first lady Hillary Clinton, now Obama's secretary of state.

Next to Clinton, Biden is widely seen one of the two top contenders for the Democrats in the next election cycle.

Also in the crowd at the Iowa party was Maryland's Democratic governor, Martin O'Malley.

Mr O'Malley was a frequent surrogate for Obama in 2012 and is also seen by many Democrats as a potential presidential possibility - meaning he could be spending a lot of time with Iowans during the next three years.
