The freedom of the Press to hold the powerful to account should be cherished, the owner of The Independent newspaper said yesterday.

Evgeny Lebedev, whose family owns the London Evening Standard, warned the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards: ‘I’ve seen the other side.’

He said that in his native Russia, corruption went unchecked because editors were constrained by Press barons who were in hock to rich businessmen.

Mr Lebedev said: ‘I was born in the Soviet Union, I come from Russia, and I can see the effects of not having a free Press is having on Russia.’

He claimed more than £180billion had been siphoned out of the country by unscrupulous oligarchs, many of whom were now living in London.

The head of Sky News apologised to Lord Justice Leveson yesterday for denying that the broadcaster had been involved in hacking.

John Ryley (pictured) said a letter sent to the inquiry stating his staff had ‘never intercepted communications’ was wrong and ‘very regrettable’.

In fact, a Sky News reporter was authorised to hack into emails on two separate occasions.

The ‘victims’ included John Darwin, the ‘canoe man’ fraudster who faked his own death.

But Mr Ryley pointed out that the reporter’s work had been praised by police for helping solve the case in which Darwin and his wife Anne were convicted.

In the second hacking case, Mr Ryley admitted that Jeremy Darroch, the chief executive officer of BSkyB  knew about the hacking of the emails of paedophile Martin Smith.

‘Where is that money going? It may be going to fund terrorism or anywhere else. So that’s the effects of not having a free Press,’ said Mr Lebedev, whose family purchased the Standard in 2009 and The Independent a year later.

He said: ‘I think one of the extraordinary things about this country is a very robust and diverse Press, and I think that has to be protected.’

He added that anyone in the media who had committed crimes should be ‘punished according to the law’.

Lord Justice Leveson also heard evidence from the boss of The Daily Telegraph, who revealed that he texts David Cameron suggestions on the economy.

Aidan Barclay, the chairman of the 
Telegraph Media Group, also once arranged for Mr Cameron to be sent an 
article about the merits of lower tax for high earners.

In another text, referring to news 
that Samantha Cameron was pregnant, Mr Barclay wrote: ‘David, good to 
see you, congratulations on the prospect of a new addition to your 
family. Spoken to TG (Daily Telegraph editor Tony Gallagher) and 
arranged daily call during campaign as discussed.’

Explaining why he sent the texts, Mr 
Barclay said: ‘I would like to think it’s more useful because it goes 
directly to the recipient rather than getting lost in the system. I was 
busy sending text messages in the hope they would be useful.’

Mr Barclay said the Telegraph titles had always been conservative papers ‘with both a small C and capital C’.

The
inquiry will hear from former News International executive chairman 
James Murdoch today, and his father, Rupert Murdoch, on Wednesday.

Evidence: Lebedev appears before Lord Justice Leveson yesterday. Later this week the Murdochs are appearing
