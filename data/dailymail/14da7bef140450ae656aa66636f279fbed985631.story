The first batch of severe weather in this year's tornado season officially hit Oklahoma and Arkansas on Wednesday, with one twister captured during a live TV weather report.

That tornado, which hit as KFOR meteorologist Mike Morgan and helicopter pilot Jon Welsh were on the air, swept through the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, caused electrical explosions and other destruction on screen.

Seven people were injured and significant damage was done to homes and business, with the roof of Southgate Elementary school ripped off.

Moore is the suburb where 24 people died in a top-of-the-scale EF5 tornado in 2013.

Twister: The Oklahoma State Emergency Operations Center was activated Wednesday night in response to the severe weather

Both sides of Interstate 35 in Moore were closed, after a semi-truck and several vehicles overturned in the storm. 

About 100 miles northeast, one person was killed and a mobile home park was destroyed in Sand Springs, outside of Tulsa.

Tulsa County Sheriff's Capt. Billy McKelvey said: 'It could have been much worse.' 

Some twisters also touched down in the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas.

The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said statewide, nearly 80,000 power outages were reported.

The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said it had reports of nine people taken to hospitals. 

McKelvey said he believed at least 15 were hurt.

Tornadoes were seen elsewhere in Oklahoma, as well as Arkansas. 

The tornado season usually ramps up for parts of the U.S. in March, but until Tuesday — when a waterspout formed over an Arkansas lake — the U.S. hadn't had a tornado in more than a month. 

A glass door at the Tulsa building that houses the National Weather Service office was smashed, and several cars in the parking lot lost their windows.

Don Ruffin said he and a neighbor were at a convenience store in far southeast Moore when he saw the tornado approaching.

'I don't know how close it was to us, but it looked like it was coming toward us, and so we didn't take any chances,' Ruffin said. 'We got in our vehicles, ran home and got in our shelters.'

Ruffin said after the storm passed, there were some fences knocked down and 'patio furniture thrown everywhere.'

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said an overturned tractor-trailer had snarled traffic on Interstate 35, a major north-south route.

'Those troopers are working their guts out there right now,' Lt. John Vincent said.

Weather patterns this month funneled cold air into much of the country, depriving the atmosphere of the warm, moist air necessary for forming bad storms for most of the month.

That all changed this week. 

Southerly winds pushed temperatures into the 70s and 80s across the Ozarks and Southern Plains, while weather fronts churned the air into Wednesday's storms.

Meteorologist Jeff Hood in Little Rock said a weak waterspout tornado briefly touched down in Bull Shoals Lake in Marion County in northwest Arkansas on Tuesday night. 

He said it will likely be classified an EF0 — the weakest tornado with wind speeds of 65 to 85 mph. A waterspout forms over water. The tornado never made it onto land, and there were no reports of damage.

Before this week, only about two dozen twisters had been recorded this year during a period when about 120 are typical. The last time the U.S. had no twisters in March was nearly 50 years ago, according to figures from the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.
