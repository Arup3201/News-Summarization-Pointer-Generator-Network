He was last seen at Graceland in 1977, but now Elvis has reappeared in the remains of a barbecue in Burnley.

A party of friends have admitted they were all shook up when the King's face appeared in the ashes of a garden fire.

Elvis' face can clearly be seen charred onto a paving stone after a group of friends swept up and is still a week later.

All soot up: Elvis' face has appeared in the remains of a barbecue in a Burnley garden and remains their a week later

Chris Elliott, 26, from Burnley, Lancashire, who made the discovery said: 'We had a garden bonfire after a BBQ and the next day after we swept up the mess it was just there on the paving stone.

'It looked as if it had been charred on to it from the fire. I shouted my mate and told him that Elvis had come to see him.'

The group of seven were left with suspicious minds after the iconic American singer took centre stage on the garden tiles, where even days later he is yet to leave the building.

Mr Elliot said: 'I knew the moment I saw it I needed to take a picture of it to show people.

'Everyone I have showed it too have either found it funny or really strange.

'It must have burnt on to the floor because it is still there now over a week later, it is really weird'

Elvis Presley is one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century.

He is known as 'The King' or 'The King of Rock and Roll' and he is reportedly the best-selling solo artist ever having sold an estimated 600 million albums worldwide.
