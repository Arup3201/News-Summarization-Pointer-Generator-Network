A contract signed by baseball legend Babe Ruth with the Boston Red Sox in 1918 has sold for $1.02 million at auction.

The document was offered for sale by Goldin's auctioneers in Baltimore, Maryland along with 125 items of sport related memorabilia.

The auction on Saturday was timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of Babe Ruth's professional debut in July 1914.

Ruth made his debut at Boston's Fenway park six years before he was controversially sold to the New York Yankees.

However, the first ball Ruth hit out of Yankee stadium in 1923 failed to reach it's planned sale price of $1,000,000. The baseball received only one online bid of $100,000 prompting the owner to withdraw the lot from sale. 

 According to the New York Post in his first year with the Red Sox, Babe Ruth earned just $2,500 - worth $60,000 today.

 He joined the New York Yankees in 1920 after Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold him for $100,000.

Other items sold at the auction included Super Bowl rings from the 1970 Baltimore Colts and 2000 Baltimore Ravens.

This promissory note more than doubled its $50,000 estimate selling for $115,000 on Saturday night
