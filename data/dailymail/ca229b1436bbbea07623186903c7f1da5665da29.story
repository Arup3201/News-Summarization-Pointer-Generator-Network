The 20-year-old has been earning rave reviews for his outstanding performances in the Bayer Leverkusen midfield this season. In fact, his game has developed so quickly since leaving Bayern Munich that Liverpool are keen to put together a deal to bring the talented youngster to Anfield this summer. Here, German football writer KIT HOLDEN explains what all the fuss is about.

So who is this guy I'm hearing whispers about?

Name: Emre CanClub: Bayer LeverkusenAge: 20Position: Midfield/defence

Wanted man: Emre Can has been on such good form this season Liverpool are keen on signing the youngster

I’m going to need more than that...

Can is one of the most versatile young players in the Bundesliga.

Having spent most of his career so far in the youth set up at Bayern Munich, the Frankfurt-born player was one pipped for the top from an extremely early age.

After only four first-team appearances at Bayern, though, Can's star faded during the 2012/13 season, and so in the summer of 2013 he chose to make the switch to Leverkusen.

It has done him a world of good, and he has developed into an invaluable midfield force for his new club. He has also represented Germany at every level from Under 15 to Under 21.

So why all the fuss?

The German-Turkish star is not just on Liverpool's radar. When Bayern sold him for £4.5million last summer, they were quick to ensure there would be a buy-back option in the deal.

The German giants have a proud history of developing their own players, and for a long time it seemed Can would become as much of a Bayern regular as Thomas Muller, Bastian Schweinsteiger or Phillipp Lahm.

Should Liverpool manage to snap him up from Leverkusen just one year into his four-year contract, it would be quite a coup: much to both Bayer and Bayern's disappointment.

What’s his style?

Can prefers to play in central midfield - 'either attacking or defending, I don't care either way' - but has been employed as a centre-back and a left-back on various occasions.

As captain of the German Under 17s team, he was the calming influence at the heart of play. His physical strength is of particular use going forward, though he is rarely overly reckless.

It has been remarked on several occasions that Can seems to have a maturity beyond his years, and his technical ability as a playmaker, either from the back or the front, is now beyond doubt.

So, a bit like?

The most commonly drawn comparison is Schweinsteiger. And not only because the young Can puts as much effort into his hairstye as Schweinsteiger once did.

His ability to switch effortlessly from defence to midfield, his dangerous shot, and his control over the pace of the game all do remind one of the established Bayern star.

For those watching his marauding runs through the centre at Leverkusen this season though, Toni Kroos has always also sprung to mind.

It is little surprise that these two Bayern stars have had an influence on Can's play. He has trained with them, or at least in close proximity to them, for several of his formative years.

How much is he worth and what happens next?

Leverkusen signed him on a four-year contract for £4.5million last summer, but his successful season has seen his value shoot up since then.

Bild reported on Monday that Liverpool would have to shell out at least £12million for him, though even that would undoubtedly be a sensible investment.

His effect would not only be limited to himself, moreover. Can was Liverpool academy striker Samed Yesil's captain in the German youth teams, and if the young striker were to return to fitness, Can's presence may see him break through at Liverpool.

Everyone has a weakness...

Some questioned Can's mentality after he failed to break into the Bayern first team as quickly as predicted, despite public support from Jupp Heynckes.

That is a little unfair considering the wealth of talent Bayern have in that position. There would be a similar fight for places at Liverpool, however, and it would be interesting to see how he rises to that challenge now.

On the field? There's little to criticise, though by his own admission, he is not the greatest header of a ball.

What happens next?

The likelihood of Can joining Liverpool depends on which way you look at it. His agents at International Sports Management have a good relationship with Brendan Rodgers and were allegedly instrumental in clinching the deals for Yesil and Nuri Sahin in the past.

Nonetheless, Leverkusen will kick up a fight. Squad manager Michael Reschke has stated that: 'We will do everything in our power to keep him. Another year of development here is important for him,' while director of sport Rudi Voller has denied any contact from Liverpool so far.

Most experts in Germany see little hope that Leverkusen will hang onto him. The threat from former club Bayern Munich shouldn't be an issue this summer, as the buy-back clause can only be activated from 2015.

Anything else I need to know?

His surname is pronounced 'Chan', like Jackie. He also shares his full name with a Turkish Grand Master of Chess.
