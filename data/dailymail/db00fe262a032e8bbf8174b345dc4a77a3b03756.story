Eliot Spitzer has revealed that he was paid more than a million dollars by CNN after his news show was cancelled by the cable network.

The pricey pay-out was only confirmed on Thursday after Spitzer succumbed to pressure from his opponent in the New York City comptroller's race to release his tax returns.

The latest move still didn't satisfy all 
critics, however, as he did not make his tax returns from 2011 and 2012 
public, instead allowing one New York Times reporter to go over to his office and look through them while Spitzer was at his side.

Opening up (somewhat): Eliot Spitzer has revealed how he made millions since resigning from office in 2008, including a massive salary from CNN, a salary from his parents real estate company and book royalties

Though he resigned from office in 2008 after he was caught meeting with prostitutes, the years since leaving the governor's mansion have been profitable ones for the Spitzers.

Spitzer and his wife Silda are living 
separately, though they still file their financial documents jointly 
meaning that they have not legally split up.

In 2012, Eliot and Silda made a combined $4.27million as she earned six-figure sums from her salary while he brought in paychecks from a variety of different sources.

Silda earned $125,325 in 2012 from her work at a private equity firm though that was a nearly 50 per cent pay cut from her earlier job.

She earned around $250,000 while working at a hedge fund in 2011.

Meanwhile, Eliot receives a $180,000 annual salary from his work with his father's high-end real estate company.

Joining in: The tax returns show that Silda, seen here entering Spitzer's office building on Wednesday, is living apart from her husband but they are still filing joint tax returns

Since that lowpoint: Spitzer resigned from governor in 2008 and has had a number of sources of income ever since

He also brought home $10,000 from his teaching work at the City University of New York in 2011 and less than half that in 2012.

Sales from his books, speaking fees and consulting work produced a combined $50,000 in 2012.

All of that work marks only a fraction of his total income, with CNN's hefty payout marking the vast majority of his earnings.

Spitzer co-headlines a show on the cable news network that was cancelled in 2011 after only 10 months on the air. Between 2011 and 2012, he was paid $2million from the channel, over $1million of which came after the show stopped airing.

Spitzer's reluctance to release the full details of his family's financial dealings comes in contrast to his previous stance on the issue, as the disgraced former Democratic governor criticized Mitt Romney for failing to reveal his tax returns during the 2012 presidential election.

Given that, Spitzer may also be embarrassed by the fact that his charitable giving- he and Silda gave $154,925 to charitable causes during the two-year-time period- is paltry compared to that of his former target.

On the trail: Spitzer's main opponent publicly released five years of tax returns, and repeatedly called on the former governor to do the same but he only ended up showing one reporter two years of returns

Politico reported during the election that Mitt and Ann Romney gave 29.4 per cent of their income away (which added up to $4,020,772 in charitable donations) as compared to the Spitzer's 3.6 per cent.

The New York Times also describes cost source as his 'modest' household help, as he spent $60,000 for their unspecified number of household employees.

Spitzer's rival released a full five years of returns while Spitzer only showed The Times reporter two years' worth. If Spitzer released five years, that would include

'Itâ€™s unfortunate that it took an entire month of public pressure to force Eliot to release two years of his tax returns, and notable that he still refuses to release the remaining three years,' said Audrey Gelman, the spokeswoman for Stringer.
