Roy Hodgson insists he is happy with the fitness of all members of his squad apart from Phil Jones, and admits John Stones will replace the Manchester United man if he is not 100 per cent by the start of the tournament.

The Everton defender has been named on the standby list for Brazil, and with Jones recovering from a shoulder injury, he could still make his debut at the World Cup.

Big decisions: Roy Hodgson addresses the media after announcing his 23-man squad

Hodgson opted for Frank Lampard, Luke Shaw and Rickie Lambert in the 23-man team, with his side facing Italy in Manaus June 14.

'The only player that poses a question for us is Phil jones,' said.' He had his operation last week. Everything points to the fact it is a three-week injury. That's why we have taken Flanagan and Stones if Jones isn't fully fit.'

Hodgson says he is grateful for Ashley Cole's maturity and graciousness at being left out of the squad, admiting it was an extremely tough decision to make.

In and out: John Stones will replace Phil Jones if the Manchester United man is not fully fit

'It was an unbelievably hard decision to make because he is a player we appreciate. The emerging Shaw has captured the headlines with his form and ability.

'It was a decision I had to take. It was hard to make the call so I'm grateful at his maturity and graciousness.

'Everyone knows what Cole can do, circumstances will prove whether it was right. I've gone for Luke.'

Hodgson has opted for youth in Brazil,
 as well as choosing the experienced Frank Lampard, who has played at 
two World Cups previously.

'The
 only way you get experience is by getting the opportunity,' Hodgson 
added. 'I still feel the balance is quite good so it would be wrong to 
focus on the players who are inexperienced.'

When asked if England will win the World Cup, Hodgson said: 'Yes I believe that otherwise what's the point. I'm certain all the top managers saying they can win it, why should we be different. But the players have to show their talent. We are right to have some optimism and we are trying to feed of that.

'There will be certain people who are regulars but so much has happened since we qualified. Those who were fringe players might not be now, which is how it should be.

'We have options and a lot of possibilities particularly for the front six positions. The back five is maybe easier to read.'

Finished: Ashley Cole, who has 107 England caps, has retired from international football
