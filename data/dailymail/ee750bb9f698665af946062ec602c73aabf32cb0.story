Petrified, ecstatic, tearful: the range of emotions experienced by brand new fathers has been charted in a poignant new set of images.

Photographer Dave Young spent the nights of 23-26th April at London's Chelsea and Westminster hospital documenting the reactions of new fathers minutes after their partners gave birth.

His charming work captures their spontaneous, unguarded reactions, coupled with a phrase or few lines of words they would like their child to live by.

Sentiments range from 'Live your life as if it were a constant pursuit of happiness' to 'No tattoos until you're 30 and always be nice to your mum!'.

The pictures were commissioned for The Book of Dads, a special Father's Day charity edition of The Book of Everyone personalised books, with 50 per cent of the proceeds of the book going towards supporting Borne, a UK premature birth charity.

Steve Hanson, co-founder of The Book of Everyone, said: 'The idea came about when we wanted to do something special to celebrate Father's Day.

'The Book of Everyone is a new start up run by three dads, one of whom has just had a baby and still has the look of wonder - or is it terror? - on his face.

'We thought it'd be fun to celebrate that awe, worry and relief on the faces of new dads who have just witnessed the birth of their sons or daughters. Dave Young was the perfect photographer to capture these once in a lifetime moments.'

Ahead of Father's Day on June 15th, the The Book of Everyone site allows you to fashion a personalised 50 page Book of Dads, which you create by adding photos, personal tweaks and special messages for your dad.

Sentiments range fromMichael Raja's: 'Live your life as if it were a constant pursuit of happiness' to the more jovial 'No tattoos until you're 30 and always be nice to your mum!'
