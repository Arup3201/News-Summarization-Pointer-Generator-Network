With artfully-tangled hair and a smouldering look straight down the lens of the camera, this is Rachel Weisz as she has rarely been seen before.

The sultry image, captured in 1993 by renowned photographer Bob Carlos Clarke, is sure to turn heads as it goes on show at the National Portrait Gallery in London.

It is one of a collection of Clarke’s celebrity portraits taken between 1971 and 1998 and acquired by the gallery.

Other portraits include Marco Pierre White taken in 1990 – with the young chef playing up to mean and moody image – and a beaming Elle Macpherson from 1993.

Another classic image is of Mick Jagger, taken in 1971 during a Rolling Stones performance at the Marquee Club in London.

The shot of Miss Weisz, now 43 and married to 007 star Daniel Craig, was taken in Carlos Clarke’s studio in Battersea, London.

The Irish photographer studied art and photography in London before embarking on his career.

He died at the age of 55 in 2006.

The images have been described as 'both classic and era defining' by Clare Freestone, associate curator of photographs at the NPG, according to The Guardian.
