A wet spring and a hot summer have brought Britain the best harvest season for years - and wet and warm is just what forecasters have told us to expect for the next few days.

The muggy air and mild temperatures seen by much of the country over the past few days are set to continue over the weekend - but sunshine will gradually be replaced by showers.

And at Great Posbrook Farm near Southampton, around half a million pumpkins are expected to be harvested and shipped to supermarkets across the country.

This autumn's harvest is set to be one of the biggest and best-tasting ever.

British apples are some of the sweetest and most colourful for years, according to Richard Capper, who has just begun the harvest at Stocks Farm in Suckley, Worcestershire.

'The good weather and summer heat has upped the sugar levels in the fruit,' explained Mr Capper, who expects to haul in almost 2,000 tons of the fruit from his orchards.

Gala, Bramley and Braeburn apples from the farm's 100 acres will be sold to all the major UK supermarkets after they have been gathered by a team of 36 pickers over ten days.

The crop is expected to produce a staggering 1200 tons of cider apples to be enjoyed throughout the winter.

Meanwhile, the weather across the country is becoming erratic and unsettled.

Thermometers were pushed up 24C (75F) in
some parts this week and above average temperatures of 19C (66F) have 
been forecast for Saturday and Sunday - but they will be accompanied by 
rain and thunder in some places.

Sunshine is predicted tomorrow over England and Wales, but it is likely to be cloudier elsewhere, with patchy rain and showers in Scotland.

The wet weather could be more persistent in the West and North West of England, the Met Office said.

Met Office forecaster Nicola Maxey 
said: 'In the South it'll be bright with patchy cloud, so we'll be seeing some good sunny spells.

'However, there could be some isolated showers, many over the South West and Wales.

'It'll
be rather warm and in the sunshine temperatures could reach 18/19C, 
while on the South coast temperatures could drop as low as 15C.

Seasonal: The partridge-like game birds live in the north of Britain and are seen all year round, but are particularly noticeable in the warmer weather towards the end of the year, when food is plentiful

'Temperatures
are the same for Saturday, with most of England seeing a degree or two 
above average for the time of year but not as warm as the first part of 
the week.

'It'll be cloudy and showery with a risk of thunder in the South West during the early part of the day.

'This is going to move towards the North East, but it's all fairly erratic and unsettled in most parts of the UK.

'It'll also be breezier than we have seen lately.

'On Sunday the rain will be spread and it's staying rather cloudy, with a risk of showers in Scotland and the North.

Wales and South England are expected to be cloudy with outbreaks of rain, but temperatures are expected to be above average again.

Some places are likely to see 18C and the cloud cover will make it feel muggy and humid again.

Ms Maxey said: 'Although the unsettled showers seem grim, the weather bodes well for gardeners as the cloud is keeping the dreaded frost away.

'We have clouds from Europe keeping temperatures warm, so it's a bit difficult to look for frost.

'There's certainly no frost for England in the next couple of days. If it's a clear night, then we are more likely to see frost but there's a lot of cloud.'
