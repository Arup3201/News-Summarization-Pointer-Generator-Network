Authorities say an 18-year-old arrested for killing a young teen after his partner drove over his body while they stole his iPad enlisted help to disguise and clean his car after the boy's tragic death.

Jacob Dismont, a baseball player at Nevada's Sierra Vista High School, changed his tires, added fake license plates as well as stickers to his SUV in the hours after killing 15-year-old Marcos Arenas on Thursday, according to police.

Dismont allegedly dragged the boy to his  2002 Ford Explorer when he refused to let go of the Apple device on the side of the road. The boy was consequently dragged by the vehicle when it took off until he fell and became crushed by the tires.

Tragic end: Marcos Arenas was killed after he refused to release his new iPad from the thieves and was consequently pulled up to the speeding get-away vehicle and run over

Michael Solid, 21, who was a 2009 Sierra Vista dropout, is said to have been behind the wheel during the crime. He was also arrested on Saturday on charges of open murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery.

The Las Vegas Review Journal reports Dismont sent a text message to a friend identified as Brian Goodwin, declaring that his vehicle was 'hot' and the right side needed to be wiped down and painted.

According to their alleged conversation, Goodwin and Dismont then decided that the vehicle should no longer be driven with it being the focus of a state-wide search.

Dismont was pulled over by police while driving home on Saturday after police saw the Ford SUV masked with license plates belonging to a Mitsubishi.

He has denied having seen Solid for at least a month before his arrest as well as having any part in the robbery.

Solid was questioned by detectives after an anonymous tip to police. He admitted having been at the gas station Arenas was seen at but denied having been with Dismont.

Birthday present: Arenas' father said that his family can't afford much so his son's birthday present of an iPad two months ago was a big deal which the young teen fought until the very end to not lose

Police say Solid's girlfriend told them he was with a guy named 'Jake' at the time of the boy's death.

Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie has called Arenas' death particularly tragic with the boy said to have received the iPad for his 15th birthday two months ago.

His father, Ivan Arenas, said that his family has never had a lot so his son valued everything he had.

'From everything we know, his dad had to go deep inside his pockets to buy this thing for this kid, and this kid knew it,' Gillespie told the Journal. 'So he was going to hang onto that thing for dear life.'

The iPad has not been recovered.

According to investigators, Solid has an arrest record of possession of a stolen vehicle, petty larceny, robbery and assault. Dismont does not have any prior adult arrests.

Arenas family spokeswoman Tabitha Guertler said family members are relieved by the arrests and grateful for the quick response by police and the public.

She said: 'We're traumatized. Marcos' loss is something that will be with us forever. He was such an incredible person.'

The oldest of 10 children in the family, the teen was a student at Bonanza High School. The attack occurred in the late afternoon about half a mile from the school.
