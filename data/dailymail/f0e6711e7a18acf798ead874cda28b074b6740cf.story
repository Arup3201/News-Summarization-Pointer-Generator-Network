The Co-op’s dramatic decline is ‘one of the great national business calamities’ but its leaders are still in denial, a damning report into its failings warned today.

Former Labour City minister Lord Myners said half of the group’s net worth, built up over 150 years, has been wiped out in just four disastrous years.

Unveiling his plans to rescue the Co-op, he said it could yet be saved but he was not confident that bosses will take the action needed, claiming some on the board do not know the difference between credit and debit.

The collapse of the Co-op bank has added to the financial woes of the ailing mutual

The ailing mutual last month reported annual losses of £2.5 billion, and has been dogged by rows over the way it is run.

To add to the sense of crisis, the former Co-op bank chief Rev Paul Flowers is due in court today charged with possessing drugs including cocaine and crystal meth.

The minister, dubbed the crystal Methodist, will appear at Leeds Magistrates' Court following his arrest in the Liverpool area last year.

Flowers, 63, stepped down as the bank's chairman in June amid claims of illegal drug use and inappropriate expenses payments.

Last month a major review found a merger between the Co-op bank and the Britannia building society should never have happened.

The problems at the bank have added to the financial woes of the entire group, which former chief executive Euan Sutherland branded ‘ungovernable’.

Today Lord Myners called for the abolition of the group's 21-member board to be replaced by a slimmed-down body to take commercial decisions.

The idea will be put before the Co-op's AGM in Manchester on May 17 but regional membership boards and independent societies that currently hold sway in the group are reported to be unhappy about the proposals.

In a damning verdict, Lord Myners said: ‘The Co-op has lost half its net worth – net worth accumulated over 150 years – in the last four years.

‘We’re talking about circa £3.5billion of erosion of wealth over a period of four or five years,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘This makes it one of the great national business calamities. And it’s been led by a board totally unable, because of a lack of experience, to hold the executive to account.’

The report comes days after the running of the food-to-funerals mutual was sharply criticised in a review by Sir Christopher Kelly into the near-collapse of its banking arm - a report which backed the need for change.

The bank faced near-collapse last year after the discovery of a £1.5 billion hole in its balance sheet, and had to be rescued by bondholders in a move that saw the group's stake reduced from 100% to 30%.

Lord Myners, who recently resigned as a director after just four months, said that the 15 lay directors on the current board were drawn from a total eligible pool of only 35 regional board members. They include an engineer, a plasterer and a retired deputy head teacher.

He said: 'Effective organisations, undoubtedly, tend to have a strong managerial presence, but it’s never down to one woman or one man; it’s down to an accountable and experienced board who hold that executive to an agreed strategy and have the right knowledge to ask the right questions.

'The Co-op board tends not to ask the right questions because the people around the board table don’t know the difference, in some cases, between a debit and a credit.'

He said that apart from the lack of relevant skills and experience, ‘this has not even been genuine democracy at work’.

Lord Myners said: ‘Radical decisions on governance structure need to be taken very soon - and with resolution - if the Co-op, as my mother knew it, is to be saved.

‘The decision lies in the hands of the elected democrats. I have done all I can do.’

The former chairman of Marks & Spencer added: ‘I have no doubt that the Co-operative Group can over the next five years reverse a decline that started over 50 years ago. But I am less confident that it will choose to do so.

‘Much will depend on the small number of 'elected democrats', less than one in 10,000 of the group's entire membership.

‘Will they put their self-interest to one side for the greater good, acknowledging the collective failure of the current board and the crippling deficiencies of the entire governance system?’

‘I would say that the group board and many on the regional boards are still stuck in denial over this near ruinous failure of governance, whereas the vast majority of ordinary members feel justified anger.’

Lord Myners said the resistance from traditionalists reflected a culture of entitlement within a small but highly active proportion of the membership.

He added: ‘This has undoubtedly created strong vested interests and a reluctance to rethink existing ways of doing things.

‘I have myself witnessed repeated instances where there has been denial of responsibility, corrosive suspicion, deliberate delay and a practice of hiding behind 'values' in order to deflect or stifle criticism and protect self-interest.’

Ursula Lidbetter, chairman of the Co-operative Group, said a resolution containing four key principles on reform will be put to members at the AGM.

Britain's largest union Unite described the report as the ‘only game in town’, which could deliver a future for the group and its workforce.
