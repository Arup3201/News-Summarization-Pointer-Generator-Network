A driver caught speeding at 140pmh around the M25 was arrested following a dramatic high-speed police chase this morning.

A police helicopter was called to assist the pursuit when the luxury silver BMW Coupe was spotted driving at twice the national speed limit.

The vehicle, which was already being trailed in connection to criminal offences, was eventually stopped when specially trained officers set up a rolling road block to bring it to a halt.

The M25 was closed for around ten minutes when police used a rolling road block to halt the speeding driver

The driver, a 36-year-old Londoner, was arrested at the scene, close to junction six of the highway at Godstone, Surrey, on suspicion of failing to stop for police and dangerous driving.

He remained in custody this morning, where he was being quizzed by police officers.

The BMW was being trailed by officers from both Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police, when it drove into Surrey on the M25 at around 2.40am.

It was driving on the anti-clockwise stretch of the motorway, towards Sussex and Kent when police deployed the road block.

Highways officials were forced to close the road for around ten minutes while the suspect vehicle was recovered and debris was cleared from the carriageway.

'A man is in custody following a high speed pursuit on the M25 this morning that started in the Thames Valley area,' a police spokesman said.

'The suspect vehicle, a silver BMW Coupe, had been pursued by officers in both Thames Valley and the Metropolitan Police areas in connection with criminal offences when it entered Surrey on the M25 around 2.40am.

'Officers from the roads policing unit, supported by the Surrey Police helicopter, pursued the car onto the M25 anti-clockwise carriageway, where it travelled at speeds believed to be around 140mph.

'Due to the danger posed by the suspect vehicle, a decision was taken to safely stop the pursuit as soon as possible.

'A rolling road block was put in place at junction six, slowing other traffic and creating a sterile area where the suspect vehicle could be stopped.

'Specially trained officers used tactical pursuit and containment - a technique designed to safely and quickly immobilise a vehicle - to stop the car.

'The driver, a 36-year-old man from London, was arrested on suspicion of failing to stop for police and dangerous driving.'
