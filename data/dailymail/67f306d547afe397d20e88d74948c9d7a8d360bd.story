Juggling your job while driving might seem like an all-too difficult task for some, and that  proved to be just the case for Melbourne radio's Mark Allen on Monday.

Allen, a former Australian golfing professional and regular on SEN radio, was talking major moot points from the Ryder Cup Golf Tournament with SEN host Kevin Bartlett when the hands-free interview he was conducting went horribly wrong.

The golfing guru was halfway through his expert commentary, when the sound of two cars colliding burst through the speakers of  listeners' airwaves during their drive home from work.

The black Mercedes Mark Allen was driving when he hit the driver in front during Monday's The Run Home segment 

The pair were chatting on the radio network's The Run Home segment, before the sound of Allen's shiny black Mercedes was heard crashing in to the car in front. 

The pair joked about the fact he was 'obviously on hands free' before Allen was immediately instructed not to say anything further following about the crash due to 'legal reasons.'

Host Kevin Bartlett said it was 'the first time we've had a crash on live radio.'

'Can you believe that he's had a crash while speaking on radio, that is a first, that is an absolute first,' he said.

'I reckon's that'd  make a good promo, don't you think?' he asked listeners.

Prior to the mid-afternoon bingle Allen had been providing expert commentary on the Ryder Cup tournament where he was breaking-down the swings of each European and US golfer.

He was just about to start getting started on world number 11 Phil Mickelson before crashing into the car in front.

He had been referring to statistics inside the car of each golfer, but insisted he was driving and talking in a legal manner when he came to rest on a Melbourne road.

'Ohh, I've just crashed KB, I've just crashed...I've just crashed my car.'

He confirmed he and the woman were both uninjured.

Most concerning to Kevin Bartlett was not the safety of the occupants involved, however, but the mere fact he'd just buckled his bright looking Mercedes.

'Not the Mercedes?' Bartlett said.

Allen, upon reassuring listeners about his rear-end bingle, told Bartlett the situation was under control.

'Yeah, I'm OK, everybody's OK, the lady in front is OK.'

To Bartlett's surprise, he thought Allen had pulled over on the side of the road but was in fact using his hands-free device to talk and drive at the same time.

Moments after the incident Allen put a call out to his Mercedes dealer in a plug for the car company to tell him that the vehicle was 'OK.'  

'If Craig Howard is listening from Berry Mercedes Benz, everything is OK Craig.' 

It appeared Mr Howard was listening, and he instructed Bartlett to tell Allen not to say anything further 'for legal reasons.' 

'Don't say anything for legal reasons that's what's coming through from Craig Howard at the moment.' 

Bartlett said the network were considering using the crash audio as a future 'promo' for the show.
