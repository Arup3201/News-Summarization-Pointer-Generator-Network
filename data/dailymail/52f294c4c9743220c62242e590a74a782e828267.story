A flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas was forced to make an emergency landing today after the captain was accidentally locked out of the cockpit.

Officials at McCarran International Airport received a distress call from the Delta Air Lines flight at about 12.10pm after the cockpit door malfunctioned when the pilot tried to return to the controls.

'About half way through [the 2.5-hour flight] there seemed to be some talking at the front of the plane. You could see the captain out there,' passenger Jesse Dougherty told ABC News. 

'There wasn't a huge panic but some confusion.'

The captain explained the situation to the 168 people on board and they reportedly broke out into spontaneous applause when the plane landed safely with the first officer at the controls.  

The plane's first officer was forced to make an 'unassisted landing' and did so successfully at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas; those on board were said to have applauded as the plane landed 

No one was injured in the emergency landing, which took place at McCarran International Airport at around 12.25pm.

The first officer landed the Md-90 aircraft using the controls at his seat as he was more familiar with the layout.

However, the first officer's seat doesn't allow access to the plane's taxi controls so the aircraft had to be towed from the runway to the gate, according to passenger Dougherty.

Airport spokesman Christine Crews said the first officer completed an 'unassisted landing' which was taken 'very seriously'.

She said: 'This was an unusual landing. He called the airport so that we would have ground response available.'
