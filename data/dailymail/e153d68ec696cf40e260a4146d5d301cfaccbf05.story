She's famous for her colourful love life and penchant for plastic surgery but according to Jodie Marsh, 35, those days are long gone.

Instead, the bodybuilder turned investigative journalist says that she's single, happy and putting her career first - even if that does mean putting her love life on hold.

'It's not that I don't want to meet someone,' she admits. 'But for now, career comes first. If I don't meet someone, I need to know that my mortgage will be paid and my future is secure. No one else is going to do that for me.'

New series: Jodie Marsh returns to TV screens tonight with a documentary that takes a look at plastic surgery

Right now, getting her mortgage paid means focusing on her fledgling career as a documentary maker, which has so far included films on steroids, prostitution, bullying and plastic surgery shockers.

The latter is something she returns to on her latest TLC series, Jodie Marsh On... which along with plastic surgery, sees her take on mail order brides, 'lying, cheating men' and virgins.

'Whenever we decide to do a new show, it's either something I can relate to or that I find fascinating,' she explains. 

'I've always been fascinated by the idea of mail order brides for instance. Do people really just order them?

'With the surgery one, I've had surgery and it went wrong. I'm very open about it. I was very willing and open to show that because people should know the dangers of surgery.'

This is at the heart of Marsh's new drive for TV ratings. Chatting at nineteen to the dozen down the phone from her home in Essex, she's clearly passionate about supplanting Kemp and co and bringing issues that she sees as deeply important to a wider audience.

New career: Jodie's current work is a world away from the glamour modelling and reality TV of a decade ago

Ask her about surgery and she's refreshingly frank, telling you how a botched boob job left her life 'destroyed' for the best part of a year - an experience that she describes as 'horrendous'. 

'It did destroy my life for the best part of a year,' she admits. 'I couldn't work. I couldn't show my body to anyone. I had such a tough year. 

'But,' she adds, 'when I did start talking about what happened to me, it turned out that it wasn't that rare. I realised that lots of people have complications with their boob jobs. 

'They rush out to have a boob job because everyone is having one and they don't realise there are risks involved. People should know.

'I didn't think that there was any risk. My downfall was not researching my surgeon enough. That's the biggest mistake I made. Too many people probably do do that. You should do proper research. At the very least, get someone who's worked in the NHS before.'

Now healed and happy, Marsh says she has no plans to change anything else in the near future, although says she would quite like to have a reduction at some point.

'There's nothing I want done,' she cackles, chuckling madly. 'Boob wise, I might have a reduction in future because they are enormous and I don't think I want 32G when I'm 50. 

'Otheriwse, I'm happy with my body and face.'

One part of her life that she's less happy with is her love live and that, conveniently enough, provided the inspiration for the third documentary in the four-show run - lying, cheating men.

'That's a personal mission of mine, it's almost like a vendetta,' shivers Marsh, whose own experience includes a failed engagement to Brentwood DJ, David Doyle, and a brief fling with TOWIE's Kirk Norcross, as well as a lesbian relationship with a hairdresser named Nina.

'It's a bit like closing a chapter. I've been lied to so many times by men. One of the reasons I've been single and celibate so long is because I've had such bad experiences.'

It's certainly true that love hasn't always been kind to Marsh, although as she admits, her continual questioning of her boyfriends (and girlfriends) words probably hasn't helped.

'I truly think if you're clever, you can catch somebody out for lying,' she explains. 'The majority of people lie and you can either turn a blind eye or go digging for the truth. 

Big plans: Jodie says she is focusing on her career at the moment but would love to meet someone one day

'There have been so many boyfriends in the past who have lied to me but I would rather know the truth and be hurt than go on living a lie.

'I am very cynical about relationships, just because I've seen so much cheating and lying.'

She tells of being particularly shocked while visiting the Miami headquarters of a married dating service and found the idea of someone paying to cheat on their spouse nothing short of mortifying.

Nevertheless, despite being a self-confessed cynic, she admits that she would like to find someone special - 'my mum and dad have been together for 40 years', she chirps, longingly - whether man or woman.

'I don't think you can ever decide who you're going to be with,' says Marsh. 'I also believe you can fall in love with someone either sex because its not so much about sexuality, it's about love.

'I don't believe in being gay, straight or bi-sexual, I just believe in loving humans.'

For now, a self-confessed happy singleton, her eyes are focused on her career - and on her one-woman mission to supplant Ross Kemp and Louis Theroux from their perch.

'I love Ross Kemp but I think there's room for me as well,' she smiles. Marsh, who can point to being briefly held hostage in a Ukrainian brothel as well as being threatened with a machete by an irate Jamaican while filming, certainly isn't short of the cojones needed to pull it off.

The final show in the series, Virgins, saw her live in a Cambodian slum for a week, while pursuing stories about FGM and sex-trafficking with her crew.

She's also working on another two documentaries, one of which is apparently so dangerous (she won't say exactly what it's about), she's had to increase her life insurance premium.

Despite the risks, however, Marsh says she's got designs on Kemp's investigative crown - and has pulled in a film crew who spend most of their time producing current affairs programmes Dispatches and Panorama to help her do it.

'The show is like Louis Theroux and Ross Kemp in the sense that it's investigative but in this case, I'm going on the journey as well,' she explains.

'My aim was always to educate, inform and entertain and if you watch it, you will laugh, cry and definitely scream. 

'Plus,' she says excitedly, 'you get my innermost thoughts as well. There's no weird editing, no fake set up stuff. It is literally me going to meet real people who have incredible stories to tell.'

And the presence of a Panorama film crew has only made her happier. 'To have the crew I have is beyond an honour,' she says, almost exploding with excitement.

'I am so grateful to be working with this crew doing a Jodie Marsh show on a hardcore topic. This is it for me, this is where I want to be. This is all my dreams come true.'
