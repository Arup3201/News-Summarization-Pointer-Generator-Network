A Texas teacher has resigned following comments she made about President Barack Obama and Muslims.

Angela Box of Houston, Texas, was appearing on a local political show, Tommy's Garage, when she joked, 'Can't Ebola just take one for the team and take out Obama?'

Box, a frequent guest on the show, also said in one episode, 'Every normal human being in the world knows that goat-f**king Muslims and, oh, boy f**king Muslims, are the evil of the world.'

Ouch: Box joked in one episode of the local political show Tommy's Garage, 'Can't Ebola just take one for the team and take out Obama?'

Too far: In another episode she referred to Muslims as 'bacon haters' and 'goat f**kers'

After these comments became public and people began labeling her a racist, she decided to resign, a decision that was unanimously approved by the school board.

Under her deal she will still receive three months of pay.

Now Box, who was a third grade teacher at Daily Elementary, is trying to make it clear she is not a racist.

Tommy's Garage host Tom Adkins tried to make this point by showing clips in which Box voices her support for South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and female fighter pilot Major Mariam Al-Mansouri of the United Arab Emirates, who flew missions against ISIS earlier this year.

She is also a fan of Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann, saying that in her dream government Palin would be head of the EPA and Bachmann the ambassador to the United Nations. 

Box also issued a statement to the Houston Chronicle saying, 'Opposing President Obama and sounding the alarm about radical Islam does not make me a racist.'

She reiterated this sentiment in an interview with KHOU last month, saying, 'I don't believe in judging people by the color of their skin. I, actually, like Martin Luther King did, shockingly, judge people by the content of their character.'

Clearing her name: Box now wants to make it clear she is not a racist, saying she judges people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin

Now, Box is also voicing her anger on Twitter in what she believes is a double standard in regards to what she can say as opposed to others, specifically liberals and radical Muslims, the latter of whom she refers to in one video as 'bacon haters.'

'Degenerate liberals and America-hating, radical Muslim apologists get to say whatever but patriots have to shut up? NO MORE,' she wrote just this week.

She has also used her new semi-public persona to share her views on other political issues, like Tuesday's release of the CIA tortue report.

Box wrote on Facebook Wednesday, 'I'm sure any of the people around the world--including the 3,000 innocent souls lost on 9-11--who have been brutally murdered, genitally mutilated, crucified, enslaved, raped, stoned to death, burnt alive, or bombed by radical Muslims would gladly trade places with the terrorists the CIA made stand up for a long time, listen to death metal, or made really super cold.'

In another post she shares her opinion that the GOP are just as 'despicable' as Democrats. 

As for the program that led to this trouble, Box makes it clear she never intended for children to watch it, or see her appearances.

'No I don't want children to watch it. That's cuckoo talk,' she said. 

'But we're adults and it plays on midnights on a cable access station. It's a comedy satire show for people that have strong opinions.'
