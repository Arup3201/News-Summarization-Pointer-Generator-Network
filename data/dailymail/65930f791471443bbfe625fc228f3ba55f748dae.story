A breakthrough medication derived from Norwegian seaweed may be an effective treatment for killer genetic disease cystic fibrosis, adding to an armoury of drugs that experts hope will help patients live far beyond their current life expectancy of 40.

The active ingredient in the new treatment is a highly purified type of alginate, a carbohydrate found in the walls of sea plants.

Research suggests it helps to break down the thick, sticky mucus that characterises cystic fibrosis (CF). Untreated, the mucus leads to problems with digestion and makes the lungs prone to severe bacterial infections – which are ultimately what kill most patients.

Alginate is already used in overthe-counter heartburn remedies like Gaviscon, and as a food thickener.

However, in the new drug, OligoG, it undergoes further processing. The drug is inhaled in a similar way to some asthma drugs. A British trial of 26 CF patients found it was safe and caused no side effects. Further study is needed but if it proves positive, the drug could be available within three years.

‘This discovery promises hope to the thousands of families desperate for an effective treatment for CF,’ says Ed Owen, chief executive of UK charity Cystic Fibrosis Trust. ‘Life expectancy has improved in recent years but it’s unacceptable that half of patients still won’t see their 40th birthday.’

The research was revealed last week by manufacturers AlgiPharma, at the European Cystic Fibrosis Society conference in Gothenburg, Sweden. It was carried out in conjunction with hospitals in the UK and Ireland, and was welcomed by doctors.

More than 10,000 Britons live with CF, of whom 70 per cent are adults. Currently, their average life expectancy is 41, although 60 years ago, 90 per cent of patients did not live beyond the age of ten.

Since then, advances in drugs, improvement in care and, more recently, routine infant screening that picks up the disease within weeks of birth, have transformed life expectancy.

Broadly speaking, the disease is caused by a fault in the gene responsible for making specific channels in cell membranes that regulate the transport of fluid in and out of them.

This fault leads to blockages in these transport channels – affecting the cells lining mucous membranes in the lungs, digestive system and other organs. Patients rely on an array of treatments to control its complications.

OligoG works by binding to calcium found in the mucus of CF patients, which is partly responsible for its abnormal density. This action thins it, meaning it can be brought up.

The hope is this will further reduce lung damage and mean fewer infections. It could also mean less dependence on antibiotics, in an age where drug-resistant bacteria is a growing concern.

OligoG is ‘a unique drug and the first that works in this way’, says Anna Ermund, a researcher at the University of Gothenburg involved in its development.

In 2012 another drug, Kalydeco, heralded a new era of treatment, tackling the disease on a genetic level rather than fire-fighting complications such as infections as they arise.

It was said to be one of the most expensive drugs ever, costing each US patient around £180,000 a year, although the NHS has made a deal with US manufacturer Vertex to pay an undisclosed, lower sum for those British patients currently eligible.

Kalydeco dramatically improves lung function but only works in patients with a rare form of CF – fewer than ten per cent of all sufferers. It is also not currently available for those under six.

Since the success of Kalydeco there has been a race to find similar drugs that will prove effective in the majority of sufferers.

There are six potential medicines currently being trialled with CF patients, and the result of one major trial of Kalydeco used in combination with another drug is anticipated this summer. It is not currently known how much OligoG will cost, but there is hope it may prove especially useful as part of a regime that includes other drugs.

Dr Janet Allen, director of research for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, adds: ‘We aren’t talking about a cure, but there is a very real possibility it will soon become a manageable illness, on a par with type 1 diabetes.’
