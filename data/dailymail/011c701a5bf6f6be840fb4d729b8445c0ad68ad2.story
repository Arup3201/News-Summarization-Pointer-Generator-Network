Great Britain came home a historic fourth at the World Artistic Championships in Nanning, China on Tuesday.

The men's team of Max Whitlock, Kristian Thomas, Dan Keatings, Dan Purvis, Nile Wilson and Courtney Tulloch celebrated Britain's best-ever finish after they trailed the United States by a narrow margin.

The format of the final meant that three of the six-strong team got to compete on each of the six apparatus, with the individual scores counting to the final total.

America, who took bronze behind winners China and second-placed Japan, finished the competition with a score of 270.369 to Britain's 269.170.

GB captain Thomas admitted he was keeping one eye on the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio - where they hope to improve on the bronze medal they won in London - following their fourth-placed result.

He said: "We put in everything and just came up a little bit short of the medals today. It's disappointing but that just shows how high our aims are.

"We know that this is just the first step though. We have an incredible team with a great mix of experience and the young guys who have been exceptional, and it is a great base to work from on our road to the Rio Olympics."

Olympic bronze medallist Whitlock scored 15.516 on the pommel horse, 15.366 on the vault and 15.400 on the floor, as well as participating in the rings and the high bar.

He was proud of the team effort, saying: "Today was great. As a team we were so well prepared and so focused and everyone did their job out there.

"We can be very proud as a team of what we've achieved. Again we have shown just how good Great Britain are at gymnastics."

The British women's team of Becky Downie, Ruby Harrold, Gabby Jubb, Kelly Simm, Hannah Whelan and Claudia Fragapane will participate in Wednesday's final.
