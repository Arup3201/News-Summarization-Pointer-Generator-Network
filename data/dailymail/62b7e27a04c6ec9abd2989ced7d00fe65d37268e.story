The impartiality of a judge in a supreme court case in West Virginia has been called into question after she failed to disclose that her husband had sold a private plane to an attorney whose appeal case she was officiating.

Earlier this year West Virginia Supreme Court Chief Justice Robin Jean Davis upheld the jury verdict for lawyer Michael Fuller’s client – a decision which provided Fuller’s firm with a payout of $17 million - one of the largest he’s ever secured.

In 2011, Fuller had negotiating a private deal to buy a $1.3 million Lear Jet from Davis’ husband in a deal that the judge never disclosed and so the exact fee decided between the two parties remains unknown.

Davis told ABC News she was under no obligation to disclose such a deal because it involved her husband and not her, but ethics experts have questioned her decision.

‘This does not look good for the rule of law,’ said James Sample, an expert on judicial ethics at Hofstra University Law School.

‘A million-dollar sale of an airplane while litigation involving the lawyer who purchases the airplane is pending before the court? Absolutely no question. It’s proper to disclose, and it is improper to not disclose.’

‘This is a circus masquerading as a court,’ he said.

The original court case was brought by the children of Dorothy Douglas who died in 2009 while a resident at Heartland Nursing Home in Charleston. Her family hired Fuller to sue the owner of the nursing home, HCR ManorCare, contending that the poor care she received at the facility led to her death.

In August 2011, a jury returned a $91.5 million verdict – $11.5 million in compensatory damages and $80 million in punitive damages – after Fuller successfully argued that ManorCare had left the West Virginia nursing home under-staffed.

Prior to Fuller, the Lear Jet had belonged to Scott Segal, a wealthy West Virginia trial lawyer who is also Justice Davis’ husband

Lawyers for ManorCare had unsuccessfully argued that the state’s medical malpractice caps should have applied which would have capped damages for the Douglas family at $500,000.

But Fuller’s arguement that the mistake was a ‘corporate decision [made] in another state for resources’ won the day and resulted in a far greater amount be awarded.

In June the case was heard by the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals including Chief Justice Robin Jean Davis and in October it was announced that ManorCare would pay $38 million.

Douglas' son and daughter will receive a total of $20.5 million, according to the Charleston Daily Mail. Fuller’s fees were about $17 million.

The final settlement was greatly reduced on the original figure, but much more than the $500,000 cap that ManorCare lawyers had been demanding.

An ABC investigation suggests that Fuller did several things outside of court which could have influences Davis including raising money for her re-election campaign.

‘Was I an advocate for Justice Davis, just like other candidates?’ Fuller told ABC News. ‘Sure.’

The other usual piece of business that ties Davis and Fuller concerns the acquisition of the private plane.

Through a series of deals ABC alleges that Fuller purchased a Lear Jet in December 2011 that was being sold by Scott Segal, a wealthy West Virginia trial lawyer who just happens to be Justice Davis’ husband.

When ABC News questioned Segal about the deal he said he had never met Fuller and that his wife had no idea who bought the plane.

‘I never spoke to or met anyone from the Fuller McHugh law firm. I never met [Fuller] or talked to him,’ said Segal.

The original court case was brought by the children of Dorothy Douglas who died in 2009 while a resident at Heartland Nursing Home in Charleston

The entire deal, he claimed, had been handled by an airplane broker named Bob Butcher.

But a court spokeswoman, Jennifer Bundy, told ABC News that Davis did know that Fuller bought the plane. ‘She knew who it was sold to,’ she told ABC News.

A source familiar with the sale told ABC News that Fuller paid roughly $1.35 million for the plane.

In a statement, Justice Davis told ABC News: ‘With regards to my husband’s plane, let me … be abundantly clear, the plane is owned by my husband, it was sold through a broker, an airplane broker, and I understand that ABC has spoken to my husband, and to the broker.’

Fuller said he played by the rules, and any decision about recusal did not belong to him.
