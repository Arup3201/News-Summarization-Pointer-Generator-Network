A New Hampshire man shot his wife dead in hospital early Tuesday morning before turning the gun on himself, minutes after posting to Facebook that he was trying to help his sick spouse 'escape' from life on a respirator.

The tragic murder-suicide occurred at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in Dover about 6am, with staff finding the two bodies inside a room of the critical care unit.

However, right before the shooting, Mark Lavoie, 50, posted a lengthy note online saying what he was doing was 'actually a double suicide', claiming that his wife, Katherine, 49, had long suffered from mental illness and recently ended up on life support, which she 'hated'.

'I am more than happy to sacrifice my life to fix my doing and join her spirit in a happier place,' the Lavoie wrote to his Facebook.

'Out of love': Mark Lavoie (left) posted to Facebook Tuesday morning that what he was about to do was a 'double suicide', because his wife Katherine (right) did not want to be confined to a respirator. He then walked into Wentworth-Douglass Hospital and shot his spouse, before killing himself

Tragic: This is the message Lavoie put up on his Facebook moments before killing his wife and then himself. He said he wanted people to understand his actions, and his sister said he acted 'out of love'

Happier times: Lavoie's Facebook is full of photos of himself and wife Katherine

'I just wanted (to) let people know my thoughts as to why I am doing this, weather (sic) you can understand it or not.'

The names of the couple hadn't been confirmed by autorites Lavoie's sister, Dorcas Lavoie, told The Associated Press what her brother did was 'out of love'. 

The case has been turned over to the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office.

'We will look into everything. We do look at social media, and that is an aspect of any investigation,' assistant attorney general Jay McCormack told The Boston Globe.

'The investigation will be thorough and we will look at all possible avenues,' 

'While the investigation is still in the early stages and ongoing, the two deaths appear to be the result of a murder-suicide.'

Scene: The double shooting occurred at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in Dover about 6am Tuesday

Life support: It is not know how Katherine wound up on a respirator, but her husband blamed himself, he said

Investigators have refused to comment on the Facebook post or say whether it is link to the murder-suicide. 

It remains unclear how 'Kathy' came to be on life support, but Lavoie said in his social media post that she has battled 'bi-polar demons that have been swirling around her brain since childhood'.

The man said it was his fault that his spouse was on a respirator because he called 911, but did not elaborate.

The Facebook post goes on to detail funeral arrangements and how to split his assets. 

'Though a difficult subject I hope my family whom I love dearly can make some sense of what I'm doing though unless you have dealt directly with mental illness (it) will be difficult,' Lavoie wrote.

'Please don't mourn for me, my spirit will be in a much better place with my soul mate; you may even catch a glimpse of us from time to time.'

As the status went up, worried friends begged Lavoie: 'Mark, please don't do this!'

'Soul mates': Lavoie asked friends not to mourn for him because he will be in a 'happier place' with his wife. The couple are seen here in an old Facebook photo

However it seems it was already too late, with the post going up moments before walked into the hospital.

As the day went on other friends posted commiserations.

One close friend, Charlene Wood, wrote to Facebook: I think Mark's choice was to not remain here without Kathy and face what would be criminal charges and he made sure he honored her wishes which was to not be in a vegetative state!!! Until our country can honor right to die laws, people will have to make very difficult choices to end their pain and suffering!!! He had such courage to carry out her wishes and put her life before his own....such honor and respect for his wife!!!!!!!

Another friend, Kelly Lee Judson-Bacon, wrote: 'Mark- I have never understood suicide but I truly believe you are a courageous and honorable man. Kathy was such a sweet, charming woman. I hope you are both together and at peace. My thoughts and heart go out to your families. I will cherish the memories we had during our school years, the class reunions, etc. RIP, my friends.'

Wentworth-Douglass Hospital, which has 178 beds, remained open following the shooting.

The intake and treatment of patients was not interrupted by the incident, officials said.

The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner will be conducting autopsies.
