President Barack Obama today released an old picture of him and his young daughter Sasha, now 12, in honor of father's day.

It came on the weekend he used his weekly address to lament the fact that his own father wasn't around and says he's still working to be a better father.

'I never really knew my own father,' he said. 'I was raised by a single mom and two wonderful grandparents...But I still wish I had a dad who was not only around, but involved.'

President's Father: President Obama's father never had a large presence in his life. He was raised by his single mother and grandparents

Obama says being a dad isn't easy for anyone - gay, straight, grandparent or foster parent.

He says he wants to encourage marriage and strong families by reforming child support laws to get more fathers engaged.

He says businesses, faith groups and communities have a role to play.

But mostly the speech dealt with Obama's personal role as a dad, something he described Friday as 'the best job I've got.'

'When I look back on my life I won't be thinking about any particular legislation that I passed or policy that I promoted - I'll be thinking about Michelle and the journey that we've been on together,' President Obama said. 'I'll be thinking about Sasha's dance recitals and Malia's tennis matches.'

Speaking of recitals, the President celebrated Father’s Day by attending his daughter Malia’s dance recital in North Bethesda, Maryland.

Obama was seen outside the Music Center at Strathmore with his arm around his daughter and walking with first lady Michelle Obama, who extended a special Father’s Day wish to her husband and all dads on Twitter.

'Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there — especially you, POTUS! -mo' Michelle Obama personally tweeted.

The President also celebrated Father's Day on Friday at a luncheon at the White House with members of the Becoming a Man program.

One young guest looked distinctly underwhelmed by his encounter with the President.

Where's my dad? The child appeared underwhemed at being held by the most powerful man in the world

President Obama, who has two daughters, cradled the baby as he dropped in on a Father's Day Lunch at the White House.

While
the baby's father looked delighted at his son's big moment with the 
Commander in Chief, the little boy seemed unfazed by the fuss.

The President told the specially selected gathering at the luncheon that being a father is the best job he's got.

At the Father's Day luncheon, President Obama had a message closer to home, telling the guests Sunday's celebration was the perfect time for fathers to remember how lucky 
they are.

Fathers and their children, along with 
students and leaders from the Becoming a Man program at Chicago's Hyde 
Park Academy were among those treated to burgers, fries and lemonade in 
the State Dining Room. President Obama spoke at the school in February.

His chief of staff, several economic advisers and his legislative affairs director sat with guests during the lunch.

Obama leaves 
tonight on a three-day trip to Northern Ireland and Germany, giving 
him a bit of time to enjoy Father's Day with daughters Malia, 14, and Sasha,12.
