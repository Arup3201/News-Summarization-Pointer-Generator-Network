These striking photos show a skull-shaped vodka bottle being brought to life by a forensic artist.

Nigel Cockerton, 50, spent one week giving the Crystal Head Vodka (CHV) skull a makeover at his studio in Dundee.

He used his craniofacial identification skills to create the bottle's structure - before adding fake skin, muscles, hair and ears.

The end result was a realistic - albeit, creepy - reconstruction of a person's head.

Mr Cockerton, who holds a Masters in Forensic and Medical Art from Dundee University, said he did not know what inspired him to reconstruct the crystal skull, which is a stark contrast from the bones forensic artists typically work with.

'I don't know where the idea came 
from to reconstruct the skull-shaped bottle,' he said.

'One day, I just thought, 'let's slap a face on it and see what happens'. I had absolutely no 
idea what it would turn out like.

'I spent a couple of hours a day doing it, just whenever I felt like it, and a week later it was complete.'

Mr Cockerton's work has now gone viral after Canadian-based CHV shared his photos online.

He has even won praise from the company's famous co-founder Dan Akroyd, who played Ray Stantz in the 1984 film, Ghostbusters.

Alongside the images, Mr Akroyd wrote: Yet another use for Crystal Head bottles - advancing science.'

More realistic: Mr Cockerton said he did not know what inspired him to reconstruct the bottle - adding: 'One day, I just thought, 'let's slap a face on it'. Above, the bottle is given human ears (left) and eyebrows (right)

One fan wrote: 'Amazing work - this is going to change the way I look at my bottle from now on,' while another said: 'I'm without words. Amazing.'

Mr Cockerton said he was 'overwhelmed' by the reaction to his work - saying:  'I'm very pleased with the final results of the reconstruction and it was great to receive the comments from Dan Akroyd.'

He added: 'To be honest though, I was trained to do this type of thing.  

'A lot of people have said how good the detail was and saying it's great skill, but it's just what I do.'

Almost complete: Mr Cockerton said he was 'overwhelmed' by the reaction to his photos, which went viral after CHV shared his photos online. Above, the crystal skull is given a ponytail (right) and a joyful expression (left)

Amazing reconstruction: 'I'm very pleased with the final results of the reconstruction,' said the 50-year-old

The skull-shaped bottle is based on 13 crystal heads that have been found in various regions around the world - from the American southwest to Tibet. 

The heads - believed to be between 5,000 and 35,000-years-old - are thought to offer spiritual power and enlightenment to those who possess them. 

Mr Cockerton said the skull he reconstructed was a European female aged between 21 and 30 - although without the real fragments of teeth, he was not able to be more precise.

Support: Mr Cockerton has even won praise from Dan Akroyd, who played Ray Stantz in the film Ghostbusters. Above, Mr Akroyd is pictured, centre, with his co-stars Bill Murray, left, and the late Harold Ramis, right
