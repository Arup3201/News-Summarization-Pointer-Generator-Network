Florentina Balanescu, five, weighed just 11 pounds after being fed nothing but the Romanian version of Wotsits since she was born 

A five-year-old girl who was found weighing just 11 pounds after being fed nothing but the Romanian version of Wotsits could be adopted by the nurse who helped save her life.

Oana Cobilita, 34, is battling EU red tape so she can adopt Florentina Balanescu, who weighed the same as 3-month-old baby, when she was found lying starved and neglected.

The little girl was taken malnourished and in a critical condition to the Santa Maria Children's Hospital in the city of Iași  in eastern Romania. 

Her parents Mihai Balanescu, 39, and his wife Camelia, 36, had fed their daughter with cheap corn puffs, known locally as Pufuleti, and water ever since she was born.

Medics gave her a life-saving drip and put her on a special diet, and worked round-the-clock to try and help the child to put on weight.

Now her nurse Oana Cobilita, 34, is fighting to adopt her after the EU imposed a notoriously bureaucratic procedure. 

She has spent every weekend with the nurse's family, but despite the clear bond, Romanian officials have so far ignored the request.

Ms Cobilita said: 'It was really heartbreaking to see how tiny she was and to realise how much she had been neglected when she first came here. 

'Of course as a nurse you want to help the sick but she was so tiny and helpless that everyone here was praying for her to pull through.

'It was amazing how she responded to attention, she was so happy to be finally picked up and played with and has made amazing progress. 

'I didn't want her to spend all her time in the hospital so started taking her on trips and getting her to spend time with me and my family so she could experience a bit of normal life, and I realised that I wanted to continue caring for her and so I started the process to adopt her.' 

The Romanian procedure for adoption is notoriously bureaucratic, imposed after the EU forced the country to ban overseas adoptions and tighten up procedures for adoptions within the country.

This has left many children without the hope of anything other than an institutional future. 

She had been found lying starved and neglected in her bed, too weak to move, and massively malnourished by social workers

Social workers recently announced that as Florentina does not need to be in hospital, she will be sent to the nearest special needs care home, 74 miles away in Barlad, Vaslui County. 

One hospital insider supporting the nurse said: 'I find it incredible that all the personal care and effort Oana has put into helping Florentina is simply ignored. 

'You only need to see what an amazing recovery she's made in just a few short months to realise that this is a very visible sign she is in the right place and with the right person.'

Professor Marin Burlea, manager of the gastroenterology department at the Santa Maria Hospital said it is now a race against time to stop the child being torn away from the person she has finally learned to trust.

He said: I don't think there is any doubt the girl will suffer if she goes to an institution because she won't be taken care of and loved the same way she would be in the family that she has now found.' 

From being bought in on the verge of death in February, seven months later she now weighs 33 pounds which according to doctors is slightly over the regular weight for a child of her height.

Her parents claimed that with five other children aged between 4 and 11-years-old to feed, they had no other choice than to feed the girl Pufuleti (right) 

Ms Cobilita has been devastated at the thought that Florentina is going to be moved to a disabled orphanage. 

Facilities at children's homes in Romania are notoriously poor and in particular facilities for disabled children are thought of as the worst.

Florentina's natural parents meanwhile who are under police investigation for neglecting their children have made it clear they do not want and cannot afford to have the girl.

A police investigation against them for neglect is still being carried out.

Police investigation is underway into why  Camelia Balanescu, 39, and her husband Mihai, neglected their child
