Movie star Brandon T. Jackson says a US Airways flight attendant called him the n-word during a Phoenix-bound Monday evening flight.

The accusation came as he was questioned Phoenix police for throwing a belligerent tantrum after being told he was cut off from drinking, TMZ reported.

Most known for his role as Alpa Chino in ‘Tropic Thunder,’ the 29-year-old actor was escorted out of the terminal and barred from catching a connecting flight to Burbank, the site reported.

That's racist: Movie star Brandon T. Jackson has accused a US Airways flight attendant of calling him the n-word

Police on the ground were called by flight crew after Mr Jackson and a flight attendant began arguing, TMZ detailed.

Tiring of his act after telling him to sit down, the flight attendant said ‘I don"t care if you're Obama's son -- get in your seat!!’

Mr Jackson made the accusation she called him the n-word while being questioned by police over the incident.

He was soon released without charge and tweeted ‘This was the most racist thing that ever happen to me  even the white people on the plane was like that racist.’

Messages left seeking further comment with both the Phoenix Police Department and US Airways have not yet been returned.
