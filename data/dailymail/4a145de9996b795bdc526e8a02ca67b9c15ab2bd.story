A father has been landed with a mobile phone bill of more than £8,000 after his children racked up the charges while on holiday in America.

Michael Westwood was sent the bill from Orange after Daniel, 20, and Olivia, 18, returned from the holiday where they had made heavy use of their phones.

Mr Westwood said he thought a package was in place which limited the possibility of huge bills, but Orange said it did not cover him for heavy internet use in the USA.

Michael Westwood has spoken of his shock after he was landed with a mobile phone bill of more than £8,000 after his children used their phones on holiday in America

Mr Westwood, of North Shields, North Tyneside, was threatened with being cut off if he did not pay.

He said: 'It was an excessive phone bill by anyone’s standards. They had been there for just five days and the bill was just over £8,234.

'I was in touch with Orange and they agreed to cut the bill to £1,600 but they have just sent a bill for £5,900 which is not what they said they were going to do.'

An Orange spokesman said: 'The customer had a Travel Data Saver Daily 30MB bundle on each of the two numbers.

'The Travel Data Saver Daily 30MB bundles gave each number 30MB of data per day for £6 per day, the charge only being applied on the days when the customer connects to the internet.

'Both numbers were using significantly more data than 30MB per day, and were therefore charged at the standard £8 per MB for usage after this amount.'

The spokesman admitted the bill had not been reduced as promised by one of their customer service staff and promised to put it right.

He said: 'The bill was incurred as a result of data roaming across two phones.

'Customers receive warnings on landing about the cost of using data abroad and are encouraged to purchase bundles to manage their data costs.

'As a gesture of goodwill, Orange agreed to reduce the bill across both phones. Due to an administrative delay one of the bills was not immediately reduced.

'This has now been processed and will be reflected in the customer’s next bill.'

Mr Westwood said Orange had kept the promise but he has asked for more time to pay the remainder of the bill.
