It's not just the bride who wants to look her best when she gets married - the groom hopes to sparkle in the wedding photos, too.

So Jon Borowik, 23, who tipped the scales at an obese 23.5 stone, knew he had to do something about his appearance before getting married to his girlfriend Jessica, 27, this April.

And in just one year the bar manager from Sidmouth, Devon, has managed to lose nine stone - one stone more than the weight of his eight-stone wife-to-be.

Over 12 months Jon shrunk from an XXXL to a medium, as he hated the idea of being fat in photos of their special day.

Jon, who proposed to Jessica on Christmas Day 2011, has had to change his entire wardrobe three times since then.

He said: 'Jessica is eight stone, so I've lost her in weight and more - it's surreal. Annoyingly, she's happy no matter what, but she's proud of me and very supportive.'

Jon now aims to reach his ultimate target of 10st before he and tie the knot.

'I didn't want to look back at my wedding photos and wish I had done something about it sooner.

'When I buy clothes now I still don't believe I'm a medium when I was an XXXL before. It hasn't sunk in'

'I used to eat a couple of portions of fruit and vegetables a week and now I have 10 a day. It's a big change.'

Jon lost the weight after joining Sidmouth's Slimming World group and ditching his diet of junk food and processed ready meals in favour of fruit and veg.

He said he was 'lazy', refused to walk anywhere and ate far too much.

'Now I can walk down the street with my head held high and don't feel as self-conscious. I went in to Slimming World with the goal of losing one stone in four months, but I lost it in two weeks. That gave me real motivation.'

Slimming World consultant Katrina Barker, who runs the town's sessions, called John 'an inspiration'.
