You know that popular saying about Emile Heskey, a cow and a banjo... well, the former Liverpool striker has gone a long way to answering his critics. 

The much-maligned forward, who was appearing as a guest on the 'Follow the Football' show on BT Sport on Friday night, was given an opportunity to prove that he can hit a cow's backside with a banjo.

It came as a surprise to Heskey when, mid-way through the show, host Des Kelly brought out a 'cow', and handed the ex-England forward a banjo to strike it with.

Heskey initially wasn't keen on striking the 'cow', but after reassurance gave in...twice

Initially, Heskey was not keen on hitting the costumed figure, but after reassurance from Kelly, unleashed. 

His first attempt did nothing to the prop - cue more claims that he really can't hit a cow's a*se with a banjo - but after a second try, Heskey did manage to break the banjo in half, to cheers from audience members at the show. 

The 36-year-old is without a team after leaving Australian side Newcastle Jets in the summer. He has made more than 500 club appearances, scoring 119 goals - a ratio of 0.21 goals a game.

He signed for Liverpool for £11 million in 2000 - a huge amount of money at the time - and went on to score 39 goals for the club in 150 matches.
