A former Auburn University basketball star faked her own kidnapping after the college's intense training schedule drove her to alcoholism, her mother and coach have revealed.

Tennessee-born Sierra 'Cece' Sims, a popular student at high school andÂ  talented basketball player, was scouted for the Alabama college and moved the 300 miles to start as a freshman in 2008.

But after just two months, she succumbed to the pressure of the grueling training schedule and classes and turned to binge-drinking as a way out. And then she went missing, sparking a widespread search and Amber Alert.

He mom, Kathie Sims, recalled Cece, who was crowned home coming queen, as a bubbly, energetic high school player who liked to enjoy herself.

'She had a lot of fun, like every other high school player did, just a lot of, what we saw, good, healthy fun,' Ms Sims told ABC News' 20/20.

But she was also an extremely talented basketball player, helping her school team secure three titles.'I remember when my assistant coach came to me and said, "You have got to come watch this kid play,"' Nell Fortner, the former head coach of women's basketball at Auburn University. She gave her a full scholarship. But the demands of being a student-athlete were tough.

'Your schedule might take you to the Bahamas or Czech Republic or to Hawaii,' Fortner said.

'They are going to get a great education tutoring. But they pay heavily for that because working out is tough. They are up at 5 in the morning, and they don't get to bed 'til 11 at night.'

Soon, Cece, then an 18-year-old freshman, had turned to alcohol and even asked her mother, Kathie Sims, if she could come home.

But her mom instead suggested she talk through what was bothering her with someone she could trust.

So one night, Cece called her coach to tell her about a campus concert she attended.

'I was like, "I am glad you are enjoying it, but, remember, we have practice at 6 in the morning, so make sure you set your alarm,"' Fortner recalled. 'She goes, "Oh yeah... I have got 5 alarms set."'

Fortner said that because her energy and her personality was always so bubbly, nobody thought for one second there was a problem.

But Sims didn't show up to practice the next day, something which immediately concerned Fortner.

'I have never felt... the pit in my stomach, the way that I felt it, when we couldn't find Cece,' the coach told 20/20.

Students reported seeing a commotion at Cece's dorm, and that she had bolted out the back door and rode off into the night on her bicycle.

This kicked off a widespread search for the teen, involving local police, the FBI and the State Troopers.

'An Amber Alert (was issued)...it spread like wildfire,' said Fortner.

After 24 terrifying hours, a police officer came across Cece.

'One of the policemen who were searching for her almost hit her,' Kathie Sims told the program. 'She looked right at him and said, "I'm Cece Sims," and he just melted.'

Back at the police station, Cece told a harrowing tale claiming she was abducted by a man and a woman in a truck.

'Cece said that she walked out of the dorm and a truck pulled up,' Fortner recalled. 'It was a man and a woman, and they dragged her into the truck...they forced pills and alcohol down her, and, there, they kidnapped her.'

However, the story was made up - she faked the kidnapping to escape the intense pressure she was feeling from the Auburn athletics program, her mother said.

In fact, she had ran out of her dorm, rode to a Walmart just miles from the college and drank for 18 hours straight.

Cece decided to come clean about the story in a video posted on the website iamsecond.com, explaining why she did it.

'I didn't want to disappoint my parents. And so I thought, "What better of a way than to say I was kidnapped?" That way, I wouldn't have to quit and be known as a quitter,' she said in the video.

Her mom added to 20/20, 'Clearly she was desperate to get out.'

Now, five years after the incident, Cece is still working to get back on her feet, Kathie Sims explained, adding that the now 23-year-old is living at home and is in counseling.

'She's not out of the woods yet. But she is going to be okay,' she said.

And after what they've been through, the mom gave a word of advice to other parents of star athletes.

'If your child calls you from college and says, "I don't want to be here anymore. Come get me," hear 'em out.'
