One of the founders of lyrics site Rap Genius has revealed how a brain tumor he initially dismissed as a toothache turned him mean - even making him tell Mark Zuckerberg to 'suck my d***'.

Mahbod Moghadam, 30, revealed that the tumor left him so moody that his co-workers at the website, which allows users to annotate lyrics with their meanings online, told him to get his act together.

Since he formed the site in 2009 with two fellow Yale graduates, the New York-based company has attracted a $15 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz and has now expanded to annotating images - in what the owners claim will revolutionize the way users interact with the internet.

But several months ago, Moghadam began experiencing some bizarre health problems.

Revelation: Mahbod Moghadam, one of the founders of Rap Genius, has revealed he recently underwent surgery for a brain tumor that altered his personality. He is pictured at a conference in May

After having his wisdom teeth removed, he had a migraine down the right side of his head which he blamed on the dental work - even though it lasted weeks, he told Fast Company.

He was also unable to work out as hard and began having problems with his left hand, such as shaking, which he chalked down to an athletic injury from his youth.

But as well as physical struggles, he started noticing other changes.

'My personality became terrible,' he said.

He explained how he started smoking a 
lot of marijuana, his girlfriend broke up with him and he began shouting
at people at work.

'My cofounders were furious at me because I wasnâ€™t doing shit,' he said. 'They said, "You have to get your act together".'

Attitude: Moghadam, pictured left with rapper Nas, previously told Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg he can 'suck my d***' but he now puts that attitude down to a brain tumor that was discovered this year

Rap Genius is a website dedicated to the annotation and interpretation of lyrics, poetry, news and other forms of text.

Users upload a rap, for example, and can annotate the lines with meaning behind the words or with opinions. Contributors earn 'IQ' points when they make interesting annotations, so other users can see who best to trust.

On the site, users can listen to songs, read their lyrics and click the lines that interest them for pop-up annotations, which are marked with a different color. Others can correct content while moderators monitor it.

Their annotation system has since expanded to images, where users can click on an image for a description or to see how they can buy it.

And
in one particularly bizarre incident, he lashed out at Facebook founder
Zuckerberg after posting pictures to Instagram showing them hanging out
together with rapper Nas and investor Ben Horowitz.

When Zuckerberg's team found out about the photographs, they asked Moghadam to remove them. He responded: 'Zuck can suck my d***'.

He now blames this outburst on the tumor he unknowingly had growing inside him.

Moghadam finally went to a doctor six weeks ago and was sent for a brain scan, which found he had a brain tumor. He was put in an ambulance to another hospital for surgery the following day.

But with his personality altered, he just played on his phone nonchalantly as he was prepped for surgery.

He survived the surgery and spent two 
nights in hospital, before recovering at home. He was left with a large 
scar, which he hates, 'but girls seem to like it,' he said.

After the operation, he said he is back to working out and is now more driven with his business.

'This really lit a fire under my ass for 
working on the website,' he said. 'This brain tumor 
motivated everyone, gave everyone a swift kick in the ass. Everyone's 
working 10 times as hard now.'

Now the team is hoping to expand and change the way people interact with the internet.

Two weeks ago, they launched Fashion Genius, which allows users to annotate imagery. For example, if a user sees a bag they like, they can click on it and be taken to a website to buy it. Then Rap Genius will get a percentage of the purchase for sending the user there.

Moghadam still has touches of the hip hop persona he uses to promote the brand, Fast Company noted, but his rhetoric has softened since the surgery.

He said that drugs are also off limits after the surgery affected his blood-brain barrier.

'The only drug I have each day is a cup of green tea, and it hits me like about six lines of cocaine,' he said.

Moghadam formed his company with Tom Lehman and Ilan Zechory; the trio met while studying at Yale University for their undergraduate degrees. He later studied at Stanford Law School.
