The British gentleman has had a makeover. Gone are the days when he would never be seen dead without a cigarette in his mouth and a Rolls-Royce in his driveway.

Instead of sporting a bushy moustache, today's gent favours the clean-shaven look and chews nicotine gum.

He gets from A to B in a Land Rover Discovery and eats muesli with blueberries for breakfast rather than smoked kipper.

Gents: David Beckham has gentlemanly 'good manners', while Sir Walter Raleigh was courteous, according to new book Gentleman's Pursuits, which examined Country Life magazine over the last century

The modern upper class man quaffs New Zealand Pinot Noir instead of claret and is more likely to go tieless than don a cravat.

The findings were published in a book called Gentleman's Pursuits, which examined the pages of Country Life magazine over the past century to see how standards have changed.

According to the list, an archetypal gent living in 1912 would attend the Proms, live in Belgravia, go tobogganing in St Moritz in Switzerland and enjoy the works of poet and writer Rudyard Kipling.

By comparison, the upper-class man of 2012 prefers the mud of Glastonbury music festival, lives in Fulham, goes skiing in Val d'Isère in France and reads historical books by Antony Beevor.

The book's five gentleman of the year are the Duke of Edinburgh for his 'stiff upper lip', Nelson Mandela for his 'quiet dignity', actor Colin Firth for 'self-deprecation', heavily tattooed footballer David Beckham for 'good manners' and London mayor Boris Johnson for his 'charming apologies'.

Its five 'perfect gentleman', who epitomised all that is chivalrous and good about their breed, were named as Sir Walter Raleigh for 'courtesy', the Light Brigade for their 'heroism when facing certain death', dandy Beau Brummell (1778–1840) for 'exquisite dressing', explorer Ernest Shackleton for rescuing his men and Lord Carrington, the former Foreign Secretary and secretary general of Nato, for 'knowing when to resign'.

Former England captain Beckham's 
inclusion would certainly have been controversial in 1912, given the 
number of tattoos that adorn his body, but the magazine said: 'Tattoos were all the rage among gentlemen, including royalty, so Beckham's passion is bang on trend.

'Although the Royal Enclosure at Ascot may take a different view.'

There are some things, however, according to the book, that a 'gentleman would never do'.

Faux pas include owning a yacht with no sails, wearing pink socks, ordering Cristal champagne and taking a holiday in Florida.

Mark Hedges, Country Life's editor, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Oscar Wilde once described; "The English country gentleman galloping after a fox – the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable" but he failed to recognise the genius of the idea in the first place.

'This book celebrates what he missed.'

Cigarettes and alcohol: Boris Johnson, seen left supping a pint, is described in the book as having 'charming apologies', while Noel Coward, smoking, right, is seen by many as the quintessential English gent

Stoic: The book says the Duke of Edinburgh epitomises the British gent with the stiff upper lip, while the Light Brigade, depicted here in a 1936 film, displayed 'heroism when facing certain death'
