Desserts like Angel Delight and Instant Whip have been blamed by the government for the decline of English apples.

Environment Secretary Liz Truss lamented that the orchard was 'a rare sight' with two-thirds of apples imported from overseas.

She claimed families had turned to 'newfangled' desserts instead of making an old-fashioned apple crumble, and took a swipe at the EU for encouraging farmers to rip out orchards.

The English apple orchard is a 'rare sight', Environment Secretary Liz Truss has warned

Official figures show that Britain produced 416,200 tonnes of apples 25 years ago but by 2012 it has more than halved to 202,900.

Writing in The Times, Miss Truss said the apple had 'always been a part of Britain' but two-thirds are now imported.

'The orchard is a rare sight,' she warned.

'Various malefactors have been involved. The EU gave out grants in the 1970s and 1980s, encouraging farmers to rip out orchards.

'Consumers reached for easily made, newfangled products such as Angel Delight or Instant Whip rather than make an apple crumble.

'Shoppers were tempted by imports of the heavily marketed Pink Lady from Australia or Golden Delicious from France.'

Miss Truss said the decline of apples had in part been cause by the popularity of easy desserts like Angel Delight, instead of making traditional crumbles

However, she has pinned her hopes of a revival on the popularity of the Great British Bake-Off, with people taking more interest in the food they cook, and eat.

She added: 'More can be done. I will not rest until the British apple is back at the top of the tree.'

A spokesman for Premier Foods, which owns Angel Delight, said: 'We're delighted that Angel Delight is so popular; however, we're not sure Angel Delight and similar desserts are solely responsible for a decline in British apple consumption.

'Premier Foods is fully committed to supporting British agriculture and every year we alone buy around 3,000 tonnes of British apples for Mr Kipling's Exceedingly Good Apple Pies.'
