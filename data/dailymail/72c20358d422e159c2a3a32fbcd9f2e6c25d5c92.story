The secretive police union is today told to put its house in order or face tough new laws forcing it to reform.

Police minister Damian Green says the Police Federation must open its books and make public details of accounts containing millions of pounds.

The Federation – still reeling from the fallout from Plebgate, its political campaigning and revelations about credit card spending and off-shore accounts – must also enact 'genuine and sustained change', he says.

A failure to do so means the Government 'will have to act instead, in the interests both of the police and the public', he said.

His strongly-worded intervention comes  after it emerged that the Federation paid a controversial PR firm for advice on using 'guerrilla tactics' against the Government in the run-up to the Plebgate scandal.

The strategy also called for a 'blitzkrieg' to halt government plans to reform pay and conditions for officers.

Yesterday a former senior official at the Federation, Fiona McElroy, told MPs about the bullying, boozy, spendthrift culture at the organisation's £26million headquarters in Leatherhead, Surrey.

Miss McElroy, who says she was unfairly dismissed by Federation bosses after advocating reform, confirmed that it had paid a PR firm thousands of pounds for advice.

It also emerged:

■ Current Federation chairman Steve Williams considered resigning after he had been 'bullied and ridiculed' by colleagues;

■ A member of staff was sent a  'personally abusive' email late one Friday night by another individual at the Federation;

■ Miss McElroy came under  'personal attack' from officials in the aftermath of a withering report on  the organisation;

■ She was warned through intermediaries – including two ex colleagues – that she could face legal action over giving evidence to MPs;

■ Literature issued by the PR firm also outlined in detail how it skilfully exploited Plebgate for the Federation's political ends.

Mr Green's warning to the Federation comes in an article for the union's in-house magazine, Police. In it, he writes he is most concerned about 'financial propriety' around so-called 'number 2 accounts' held by local branches.

These are thought to contain tens of millions of pounds and details of their contents were not declared to the Normington Review – a report by former Home Office mandarin Sir David Normington which also recommended radical change.

He says the Federation must show its members how 'every penny' of both their and the public's money is spent and calls for 'full transparency' on spending.

Mr Green says the Federation has a responsibility to ensure money is spent 'sensibly and transparently'.

'Any officer at any time should be able to know where every penny of their money has gone,' he said.

And he warns that no organisation 'can expect to abuse public trust or members' resources'.

Mr Green said: 'I would prefer the Federation to decide how they do it themselves to the timetable set by David Normington. If they do not,  we stand prepared to take action  if necessary.'

Miss McElroy's testimony before the Home Affairs Select Committee yesterday will also heap pressure on the Federation to modernise.

She confirmed details of a secret plot outlined in a £10,000-a-month contract handed to a public relations company run by former DJ Jon Gaunt.

This was weeks before the Plebgate incident in September 2012 involving then Government chief whip Andrew Mitchell and a policeman at the gates of Downing Street.

Mr Mitchell has always denied calling Downing Street police officers '****ing plebs', insisting the row was hijacked by Federation officials for political ends.

Under questioning from Tory MP Michael Ellis, Miss McElroy – sacked as head of communications at the Federation in February – confirmed she had seen the contract.

She said: 'I was aware of a contract that had been put in place. The reason I came across it was when I joined the organisation and I was trying to understand where the risks were.'

She confirmed she had seen the words 'guerrilla tactics' in the contract, but did not recall seeing 'blitzkrieg'. Other sources confirm that 'blitzkrieg' was in the document.

Literature issued by Mr Gaunt's firm has also outlined in detail how it exploited Plebgate for the Federation's political ends.

Miss McElroy added: 'I said there are much more sophisticated ways to engage and debate without making it personal, aggressive, hostile and still achieve the same aims.'

Miss McElroy said the chairman of the Federation Steve Williams 'was considering his own position and was asking me to help him on how to move in that way' after the Normington Report on the organisation was published in January.

She said: 'He had personally been criticised, verbally ridiculed, attacked and bullied.' On bullying, she said was confronted in a bar by a colleague at 10pm when 'much alcohol had been consumed'.

She said there were no rules about how Federation corporate credit cards were used. She said there was a meeting of Federation reps from across the UK when they ran up bills of 'some £300 or £400'.

Both the Police Federation and former Sun columnist Mr Gaunt, 53, have refused to discuss the 'guerrilla tactics' contract.
