A 40-year-old woman has been arrested by police after allegedly trying to smuggle $70,000 into the Dominican Republic in her stomach.

The suspect, who has not been named, was detained at an airport in the popular tourist resort of Punta Cana in La Altagracia Province after arriving on a flight from Brussels.

She was reportedly found to have $70,000 in cash in her stomach, divided up among a staggering 16 capsules, as well as a further $69,000 inside her suitcase.

Although there is no indication that the money was split equally, if it was, each capsule would have contained $4,375. 

The cash, obtained in Belgium, is believed to be linked to drug trafficking, according to Dario Medrano, a spokesman for the National Drug Control Agency.

The woman, who was arrested at Punta Cana International Airport, is the first person to have been taken into custody in the Dominican Republic on suspicion of smuggling money in their stomach.

It is not known how authorities were alerted to the alleged stash of money.
