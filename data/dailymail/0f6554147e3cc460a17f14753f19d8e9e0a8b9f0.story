It is a familiar scenario. An older man talks to his beautiful brunette wife as she pulls faces amid the shrubbery at one of the now-infamous outside tables at Scott’s Restaurant in London’s Mayfair. 

But unlike the headline-grabbing spat at the same spot that brought about the end of the marriage of art mogul Charles Saatchi and celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, this light-hearted exchange between  David Bailey and his wife Catherine Dyer ended in an affectionate kiss.

As one of the world’s greatest portrait photographers, David Bailey unquestionably has an eye for a face. But which one?

Catherine, an evergreen American model who has been Mrs Bailey since 1986, seems to be channelling her inner Nigella in a series of increasingly bizarre facial expressions as David and their son Fenton look on in wonder and amazement.

By turns shocked, snorting and bemused, Catherine – who is 23 years younger than her 76-year-old husband – appears to be acting out the Nigella and Saatchi scene, before leaning over to peck her man on the lips.

Meanwhile, 26-year-old artist and photographer Fenton, one of the couple’s three  grown-up children, is certainly  a chip off the old block. 

With his flowing, long brown hair, he is the very image of his father David back when he was the cockney enfant terrible who captured London’s Swinging Sixties on film.
