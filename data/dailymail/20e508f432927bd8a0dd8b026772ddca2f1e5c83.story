Formula One title rivals Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg are adamant nothing changes between themselves in the wake of Mercedes being crowned constructors' champions.

Mercedes clinched their first constructors' crown on the back of the team's ninth one-two of a thoroughly-dominant campaign at the inaugural grand prix in Russia earlier this month.

Hamilton took the chequered flag for the fourth time in a row, and ninth overall this season to open up a 17-point cushion over Rosberg with three races remaining.

The suggestion has long been once Mercedes wrapped up the constructors' title then the gloves would be off between Hamilton and Rosberg in their battle to claim the drivers' championship.

The duo have already been embroiled in a number of on-track battles this season in Bahrain, Spain, Monaco, and notably Belgium where Rosberg collided with Hamilton.

Despite the circumstances heading into the closing trio of races in the United States, Brazil and Abu Dhabi, Hamilton said: 'It doesn't change anything. The same rules apply.

'We are both racing as hard as we can, we are allowed to race as hard as we can, and we still want to get maximum points for the team.'

Rosberg concurred as he said: 'Up until now it's always been we can fight, and it continues to be like that. We can fight, it doesn't change.'
