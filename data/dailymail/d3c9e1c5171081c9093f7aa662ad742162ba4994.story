Islamic militants overran parts of Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul today, driving security forces from their posts and seizing the provincial government headquarters, security bases and other key buildings.

Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki pressed parliament to declare a state of emergency.

The fight for Mosul was a heavy defeat in Baghdad's battle against a widening insurgency by a breakaway al-Qaida group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which has been trying - with some success - to seize territory both in Iraq and neighboring Syria.

Children are among the 150,000 people who have fled the city where gun battles now rage

Earlier this year, the group captured
 another Iraqi city, Fallujah, in the west of the country, and 
government forces have been unable to take it back after months of 
fighting. The far larger Mosul is an even more strategic prize.

The city and surrounding Ninevah province are a major export route for Iraqi oil and a gateway to Syria.

Regaining Mosul poses a daunting challenge for al-Maliki.

The city has a Sunni Muslim majority and many in the community are already deeply embittered against his Shiite-led government.

Thousands of the city's residents are now refugees seeking safety in other parts of the country

During the nearly nine-year American presence in the country, Mosul was
 a major stronghold for al-Qaida and U.S. and Iraqi forces carried out 
repeated offensives there, regaining a semblance of control but never 
routing the insurgents entirely.

Islamic
 militants and Iraqi troops have been fighting for days in Mosul. But 
Monday night and into early Tuesday, the government forces in the city 
appeared to collapse.

Insurgents
 overran the Ninevah provincial government building in the city - a key 
symbol of state control - in the evening, and security forces fled many 
of their posts.

The fighters stormed police stations, bases and prisons, capturing weapons and freeing prisoners.

On
 Tuesday, Mosul residents said the militants appeared to be in control 
of several parts of the city, raising the black banners that are the 
emblem of the Islamic State.

Thousands fled as Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki pressed parliament to declare a state of emergency

One refugee said: 'The situation is chaotic inside the city and there is nobody to help us'

The residents spoke to The Associated Press by telephone on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety.

In
 a nationally televised press conference Tuesday, al-Maliki asked 
parliament to declare a state of emergency, acknowledging that militants
 had taken control of 'vital areas in Mosul.' He said the public and 
government must unite 'to confront this vicious attack, which will spare
 no Iraqi.'

State TV said parliament would convene on Thursday.

Under the constitution, parliament can declare a 30-day state of 
emergency on a two-thirds vote by its members, granting the prime 
minister the necessary powers to run the country. Legal experts said 
that could include powers to impose curfews, restrict public movements 
and censor the media.

'What
 happened is a disaster by any standard,' parliament speaker Osama 
al-Nujaifi - a Sunni from Mosul - said in a televised address.

'The presence of these terrorist groups in this vast province ... 
threatens not just the security and the unity of Iraq, but the whole 
Middle East,' he said.

He 
said militants had seized helicopters at Mosul airport and captured 
weapons depots, and captured several villages and a military airbase 
further south in Salahuddin province, he said.

Residents began fleeing Mosul - though the size of the flight was not yet clear.

A
 government employee who lives about a mile from the provincial 
government building, Umm Karam, said she left with her family Tuesday 
morning.

Two Iraqi army officers said security forces had received orders to leave the city after militants captured the Ghizlani army base in southern Mosul and set more than 200 prisoners free from a high security jail

The retreating army and police forces set fire to fuel and ammunition depots in order to prevent the militants from using them, the Iraqi officers said

'The situation is
 chaotic inside the city and there is nobody to help us,' she said, 
speaking on condition she be identified by a nickname for fear of her 
safety. 'We are afraid ... There is no police or army in Mosul.'

The
 assault in Mosul is also a sign of Iraq's reversals since American 
forces left the country in late 2011. Militants ramped their insurgency 
back up over the past two years.

The Islamic State has presented itself as the Sunni community's 
champion against al-Maliki's Shiite-led government as the group fights 
on both sides of the border in what Iraqi officials have said is an 
attempt to carve out an enclave for itself in western Iraq and eastern 
Syria.

The group, which 
was once al-Qaida's branch in Iraq, was thrown out of the terrorist 
network after it expanded its operations in Syria against the orders of 
al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri. It is considered one of the most 
ruthless rebel forces fighting to topple President Bashar Assad in 
Syria, where it has in seized a major city in the east and other 
territory.

In Iraq, the 
group rose up earlier this year to take over Fallujah and parts of the 
nearby city of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province. It has also been 
carrying out a campaign of bombings and other violence in Baghdad and 
other parts of the country.

In
 the Mosul fighting, insurgents armed with machineguns and 
rocket-propelled grenade launchers stormed the provincial headquarters 
building late Monday, overpowering guards in a short firefight, 
according to Ali Mahmoud, the media official for Ninevah province.

He
 confirmed accounts by Mosul residents that many of the police and army 
forces that had been stationed in the city had disappeared by Tuesday.

Provincial
 governor Atheel al-Nujaifi, the parliament speaker's brother, was in a 
nearby guest house. He managed to escape the area and left the city, 
though he continues to monitor the situation, Mahmoud said.

On Monday, the governor had urged residents to fend off the attackers.

'I
 call upon the men of Mosul to stand firm in their areas and to defend 
them against the strangers and to form public committees in their 
districts to help their people and to protect their areas,' he said in a
 transcript of a speech posted online.
