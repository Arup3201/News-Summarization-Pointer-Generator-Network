Inmates at a high-security jail have bombarded prison bosses with thousands of trivial complaints about missing DVDs, poor heating and having to share a cell with smokers.

Workers at Strangeways, which houses 1,200 prisoners and 200 lifers, were bombarded with 3,500 complaints last year - or almost ten every day.

Records show staff have had to deal with hundreds of petty grievances - including one from an inmate who complained that he had not received a television listing magazine.

On another occasion staff were forced to trawl through CCTV footage to find out what had happened to a missing flask.

Several complaints were received about the prison heating system, which does not offer in-cell temperature control, details released under Freedom of Information laws revealed.

Other grievances raised included cold showers, the quality of meat in the
canteen, a confiscated pen, outstanding DVD orders, dodgy milk, missing
newspapers, sharing cells with smokers and demands for hot chocolate 
and extra bread.

Staff at the jail - also known as HM Prison Manchester - were also asked to amend the washing powder order after one prisoner requested non-bio because of a skin condition.

Other complaints included a problem with gym equipment and a problem with Playstation games, which are available as an incentive to prisoners.

Of more than 750 grievances logged in
the first three months of this year, only around 30 were of the most 
serious nature, involving issues with or allegations against staff, such
as assault or bullying.

Many were found to have no supporting evidence. Two were referred to the police for investigation.

Other legitimate grievances involved 
transfer requests, appeals over prisoner categorisation or requests to 
come off closed visits, where inmates are separated from visitors by 
glass.

The prison employs a full time clerk 
to handle complaints. But many of those logged through official channels
do not require formal handling, said officials.

Many of the complaints involved grievances about food and diets - including a mix up over a sausage roll in which the prison had to apologise to an inmate with severe allergies.

One of the first complaints of the year came from an inmate who had not received a Christmas card. He was advised that there was no outstanding post.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'Prisoners are expected to raise concerns so their matter can be addressed appropriately.

'The formal complaints system exists so they can raise more important issues. Often topics raised under the complaints system are more appropriate to be dealt with by other means, but are registered as a complaint.

'Issues that can seem quite minor can cause disproportionate concern to prisoners.

'A formal complaints system plays an important part in defusing these concerns.'
