They
 are ailments many believed were consigned to the dim and distant past, 
in Britain at least: gout, rickets, whooping cough, tuberculosis and 
typhoid.

Yet last week, the NHS Health and Social Care Information 
Centre revealed that these diseases are re-emerging with alarming speed.

Here, ANTONIA HOYLE hears from the experts about why we are seeing a 
resurgence, and how treatments have improved over the past 100 years...

FAMILIAR COMPLAINT: An 18th Century drawing of a man being treated for gout

WHAT IS IT?

A
 form of arthritis caused by the crystals of a compound called uric acid
 forming in joints. This leads to inflammation. Alcohol and rich food 
increase risk. In Victorian times, gout was associated with the 
port-swilling rich.

HOW DID IT DISAPPEAR?

It didn't, but improvements in medicine in the 20th Century meant it was more easily treated.

WHY IS IT BACK?

'Obesity
 and alcohol consumption is not confined to the rich any more,' says Dr 
John Middleton, vice-president of the UK Faculty of Public Health. Last 
year 86,866 patients with gout were admitted to hospital - an increase 
from 48,717 patients in 2009.

HOW IS IT TREATED?

THEN: 'Opium was 
taken with whisky, and cocaine was used as an anaesthetic,' says Carla 
Valentine, curator at Barts Pathology Museum in London.

NOW: Ice 
packs and painkillers ease discomfort while a drug called allopurinol 
lowers uric acid levels. Eliminating alcohol and red meat from the diet 
reduces the risk of future attacks.

Rickets is a predominantly childhood disease that is caused by Vitamin D deficiency

RICKETS

WHAT IS IT?

A 
predominantly childhood disease that is caused by Vitamin D deficiency 
and leads to 'soft' bones. During Victorian times, rickets was epidemic 
because smog in cities blocked natural sunlight, a primary source of 
Vitamin D.

HOW DID IT DISAPPEAR?

In the early 20th Century, foods started being fortified with Vitamin D.

WHY IS IT BACK?

One
 in four children is now not getting enough sunlight. 'This is 
compounded by efforts to prevent skin cancer,' says Dr Middleton. 
'Actually people need exposure  to the sun, little and often.'

Dietary
 deficiency is also to blame - an increase in breastfeeding has 
exacerbated the problem as breast milk contains less Vitamin D than 
formula brands. There were 702 cases in 2012, up from 561 cases in 2008.

HOW IS IT TREATED?

THEN:
 From the 1700s, cod liver oil has been used to combat rickets. In the 
20th Century all schoolchildren were prescribed cod liver oil until the 
1950s.

NOW: The Government recommends all children under five take 
daily Vitamin D supplements. Families are also advised to spend up to 20
 minutes in the sun daily without sunscreen.

TUBERCULOSIS (TB)

WHAT IS IT?

An
 infection that mainly affects the lungs but can also impact  on the 
bones and the nervous system. Symptoms include a persistent cough, 
weight loss, night sweats, fever and tiredness. TB - historically called
 consumption - killed one in four people during Victorian times.

HOW DID IT DISAPPEAR?

Less
 crowded living conditions in the 20th Century cut infection. 
Administration of the BCG vaccine from the 1920s, the discovery of 
antibiotics in 1928 and the introduction of the antibiotic streptomycin 
also helped.

WHY IS IT BACK?

The rise in immigration from Eastern 
Europe where TB is more common, and our increasingly crowded cities. In 
2011, 8,963 cases of TB were reported in the UK. 'We need better 
treatment services to identify people in the early stages,' says Dr 
Middleton.

HOW IS IT TREATED?

THEN: 'People were quarantined in 
sanatoriums in the countryside,' says Carla Valentine. 'They were also 
put in a steam room with herbs to clear their lungs.'

NOW: Extra BCG 
vaccines for babies in high-risk areas. Sufferers are prescribed 
antibiotics. 'There is a new test that exposes people who have TB - even
 if they are not displaying symptoms - so they can be given a course of 
antibiotics,' says Dr Middleton.

WHOOPING COUGH

WHAT IS IT?

A 
bacterial infection of the lungs and airways, it begins with a 
persistent dry cough and progresses to fever and bouts of coughing that 
have a 'whooping' noise. In the Victorian era it killed more than 1,000 
people a year.

WHY DID IT DISAPPEAR?

A vaccine introduced in the 1950s.

WHY IS IT BACK?

Since
 the 1990s, new vaccinations have proved less powerful, and the bacteria
 that cause whooping cough are more resistant to them. Dr Middleton says
 isolated pockets of people in deprived areas haven't been immunised. 
The biggest spike in cases since 1959 happened in 2012 when in the first
 ten months of the year there  were 7,728 reported cases, with 13 babies
 believed to have died.

HOW IS IT TREATED?

THEN: 'Patients were rehydrated with a mixture of sugar and salt water,' says Valentine.

NOW:
 Antibiotics. All pregnant women are offered a vaccine. Children are 
vaccinated at two, three and four months, and then given a pre-school 
booster.

Typhoid/cholera are bacterial infections caught by drinking contaminated water

TYPHOID/CHOLERA

WHAT ARE THEY?

Bacterial infections 
caught by drinking contaminated water. Symptoms include diarrhoea, 
sickness and fever. Both diseases were epidemic in Victorian times 
because of poor sewerage systems. One in five affected died.

HOW DID THEY DISAPPEAR?

With new vaccines in the late 19th Century and the introduction of antibiotics in the 1940s.

WHY ARE THEY BACK?

Because
 we're bringing back the infections from abroad. 'It is a consequence of
 international travel,' says Dr Middleton. There are an estimated 500 
cases of typhoid each year in the UK. Although no cases of cholera have 
originated in England and Wales for more than 100 years, there were 12 
reported cases of Britons infected abroad during 2012.

HOW ARE THEY TREATED?

THEN: Salt water and sugar for dehydration, and bed rest.

NOW: Antibiotics. Vaccines are recommended for anyone travelling to countries where diseases are widespread.
