Sopranos star James Gandolfini was set to return to HBO in a new crime series called Criminal Justice, it has emerged.

The network which made the actor a household name had ordered seven hour-long episodes of the crime drama.

It is believed that Gandolfini was due to star as Jack Stone, an attorney who was down on his luck.

However, following the 51-year-old's death from a massive heart attack on Wednesday, the show now faces an uncertain future.

The network had originally ordered a pilot for the show in September. However, as reported by the Hollywood Reporter, it later passed on the project.

But two months ago it changed its mind and ordered seven episodes.

The crime drama is based on a BBC show with the same name from 2008 .

In each five-episode season of the show, which was written by Peter Moffat, it followed an individual  through the justice system.

The actor was also due to executive produce Canadian comedy Taxi-22 for CBS.

As reported by the New York Post, a statement by HBO said on Wednesday: 'We're all in shock and feeling immeasurable sadness at the loss of a beloved member of our family.

heart attack

'He was special man, a great talent, but more importantly a gentle and loving person who treated everyone, no matter their title or position, with equal respect.

He touched so many of us over the years with his humor, his warmth and his humility.'

Doctors revealed that they battled for 40 minutes to save Gandolfini after he suffered the heart attack in his hotel room in Italy on Wednesday night.

Medical staff rushed to Hotel Boscolo in Rome after the actor's 13-year-old son found his father suffering the attack in their bathroom around 10pm.

He was taken by ambulance to Policlinico Umberto I hospital where he was pronounced dead. The actor, best known for his role as Tony Soprano in HBO series The Sopranos, was just 51.

'The resuscitation maneuvers, including heart massage etc., continued for 40 minutes and then, seeing no electric activity from the heart, this was interrupted and we declared James dead,' said emergency room chief Claudio Modini.

'The patient was considered dead on arrival, and for that reason an autopsy has been requested to be carried out by a pathologist, as is normal procedure in our country.'

Details about Gandolfini's final moments come as a photograph has emerged apparently showing Gandoflini enjoying an evening out with his family the night before his sudden death

In what could be the last picture of the award-winning actor, Gandolfini appeared at ease and in good health as he ate dinner at the Sabatini Restaurant with his son Michael, according to fellow holidaymaker Blake Kahn, who took the photo.

Family tragedy: The actor was married twice, to

with him

The Sopranos star was on vacation in 
Rome with Michael, wife Deborah and their nine-month-old daughter 
Liliana to 'reconnect with his Italian roots' before the Taormina Film 
Festival in Sicily.

The actor rose to fame playing a 
hitman in the 1993 film True Romance, and roles in films such as 
Terminal Velocity and Get Shorty followed.

However, it was not until his breakout role in 1999 in the hit television show The Sopranos that he  became a household name.

He played the powerful mob boss Tony 
Soprano, whose stressful gangster and family life left him needing to 
visit a psychiatrist, played by Lorraine Bracco.

His compelling portrayal of the ruthless mob boss who suffered from panic attacks saw him win three Emmy Awards for the role.

The character apparently died in the 
series finale, although the audience was never shown the moment of his 
death, with the screen just fading to black instead.
