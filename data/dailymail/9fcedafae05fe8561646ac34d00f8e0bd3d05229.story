Mattresses, portable toilets and showers were brought in Saturday for 700 unaccompanied minors who spent the night sleeping on plastic cots inside an Arizona warehouse, a federal official said.

A Homeland Security official told The Associated Press that about 2,000 mattresses have been ordered to the makeshift holding center — a warehouse that has not been used to house people in years.

Gov. Jan Brewer's spokesman, Andrew Wilder, said Friday that conditions at the center are so dire that federal officials have asked the state to immediately ship medical supplies to the center in Nogales.

Overflowing: The shelter at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids, forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to Nogales for processing

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security started flying immigrants to Arizona from the Rio Grande Valley in Texas last month after the number of immigrants — including more than 48,000 children traveling on their own — overwhelmed the Border Patrol there.

Immigrant families were flown from Texas, released in Arizona, and told to report to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office near where they were traveling within 15 days. ICE has said the immigrants were mostly families from Central America fleeing extreme poverty and violence.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no authorization to discuss the matter publicly, said the holding center opened for unaccompanied children because the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had nowhere to turn.

'They became so overwhelmed and haven't kept up with planning,' the official said.

At the holding center, vendors are being contracted to provide nutritional meals, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, meanwhile, will provide counseling services and recreational activities.

The Homeland Security official said 
the number of children at the warehouse was expected to double to around
 1,400. The warehouse has a capacity of about 1,500.

The
 warehouse began housing children flown from South Texas last Saturday. 
About 400 were scheduled to arrive Friday but, because of mechanical 
issues with the planes, only about 60 came, the Homeland Security 
official said. Saturday's flights were canceled, also because of 
mechanical problems. There are flights scheduled through mid-June.

Federal
 authorities plan to use the Nogales facility as a way station, where 
the children will be vaccinated and checked medically. They will then be
 sent to facilities being set up in Ventura, California; San Antonio, 
Texas; and Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

Wilder
 said reports from consulates that the Department of Homeland Security 
was stopping the program to fly migrant families to Arizona and then bus
 them to Phoenix were incorrect. Instead, the program that has shipped 
unknown thousands of adult migrants and their children to Arizona since 
last month shows no sign of stopping, he said.

'The
 adults, the adults with children, families — that continues unfettered 
and we have no idea where they are going,' Wilder said.

In
 a statement Friday, Homeland Security officials said "appropriate 
custody determinations will be made on a case by case basis" for 
migrants apprehended in South Texas.

Many of the children appear to be teenagers but some clearly are younger

Lackland has become a temporary shelter for youths caught crossing the border illegally and alone

Brewer
 sent an angry letter to President Barack Obama on Monday demanding that
 the program of dropping off families at bus stations in Phoenix stop 
immediately. She called the program dangerous and unconscionable, asked 
for details and demanded to know why state authorities weren't consulted
 or even informed.

The governor said she hadn't received a response to her letter by Friday.

'I
 have reached out to Federal Homeland Security Director Jeh Johnson for 
answers. Meanwhile, I reiterate my call on President Obama to secure our
 southern border and terminate this operation immediately,' Brewer said 
in a statement.

Brewer's
 staff spent Friday in a series of calls with officials from FEMA, 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security.

Wilder
 said FEMA's Region 9 administrator was being sent to the holding center
 in Nogales on Saturday to oversee efforts to deal with the hundreds of 
arriving children.

The 
federal emergency supplies are held in Arizona warehouses, and Wilder 
said the state is working to send them to the holding center.

America has been left astounded by the shocking conditions these children have been kept in - conditions so dire that border control agents fear the spread of disease

About 850 that were being housed at the facility have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor

On
 Friday night, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that young 
lawyers and paralegals are being sought for the community service 
program AmeriCorps to provide legal assistance in

immigration
 proceedings to children who come to the U.S. illegally. Officials say 
about 100 lawyers and paralegals will be enrolled as members of 
AmeriCorps in a new division called 'justice AmeriCorps.'

Immigration
 officials can immediately return Mexican immigrants to the border, but 
they are much more hard-pressed to deal with Central American migrants 
who illegally cross into the U.S. In recent months, waves of migrants 
from nations south of Mexico have arrived in Texas.

The
 Homeland Security official said that legally, only their parents or 
guardians can take custody if the government makes the children eligible
 for release.

Officials
 in Central America and Mexico have noticed a recent increase in women 
and children crossing the border. Father Heyman Vazquez, the director of
 a migrant shelter in Huixtla in the southern Mexico state of Chiapas, 
said he and others advise children that it's too dangerous.

Yet Vazquez is seeing more and more youths heading north.

'I
 remember a little boy of 9 years old and I asked if he was going to go 
meet someone and he told me "No, I'm just going hand myself over because
 I hear they help kids,"' Vazquez said.

The perception that some immigrants could be getting a free pass into the U.S. could lead to more attempts to cross the border.

President Barack Obama said the sharp influx of unaccompanied children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala was an 'urgent humanitarian situation'

More than 33,000 minors were apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas since October last year, it has been reported

Illegal
 immigration increased heavily under a 'catch-and-release' strategy 
during the George W. Bush administration. Under that policy the 
government issued notices to appear in immigration court to migrants 
from countries other than Mexico until Bush stopped the practice.

Federal
 officials then established a 210-mile stretch of the Texas-Mexico 
border as a zero-tolerance zone for illegal immigration. Instead of 
merely getting sent back home, migrants were arrested, prosecuted and 
sometimes sentenced to prison before being formally kicked out of the 
country.

By August 2006, border agents in the Del Rio, Texas, sector said daily arrests had dropped from 500 to fewer than 100.

The
 half-century-old section of a U.S. Air Force base in Texas has been 
transformed into a holding and processing center for thousands of 
children illegally crossing the border from Central and South America 
without adults.

Leaked 
photos from the base obtained by Breitbart show hundreds of children 
holed up in crowded concrete rooms, many of them sleeping on the bare 
floor without blankets or pillows.

Among
 those children are Jose Maquez Soto, 12, who came from Honduras to the 
United States and now rests on a bunk at Lackland Air Force Base in San 
Antonio under a hand-drawn flag of his native country and a message 
cheering the Honduran squad in the upcoming soccer World Cup.

Jose
 is one of the 60,000 'unaccompanied minors' - children under 18 - that 
the Obama administration estimates will enter the United States 
illegally this year.

It
 projects that number to grow to nearly 130,000 next year, creating what
 the White House describes as an 'urgent humanitarian situation'.

At the base, children are provided with three hot meals and two snacks a day. They can call home twice a week. They have access to mental health clinicians and on-site medical care

The minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala

Nearly
 1,000 of the minors at a time are being sheltered at a facility built 
about 50 years ago to house new recruits for basic training.

The
 boys and girls will pass along corridors with faded Air Force pictures 
and new signs written in Spanish that point the way to the dining hall 
and bathrooms.

Since the facility opened three weeks ago, 1,820 children have passed through the center.

About
 850 have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor, said 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Jesus Garcia.

The person who takes the child, Garcia says, has to agree to bring the child to an immigration hearing.

The minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.

They are sometimes seeking to reunite with a parent who is already in the United States, also without documentation.

Another facility for minors will open at Naval Base Ventura County in Southern California that will hold a maximum of 600 children.

At Lackland, the children between the ages of 12 and 17 are handed several sheets and towels when they arrive and checked for lice and scabies.

Republicans blame President Obama for the situation, pointing to his 2012 policy that sent a message of hope to kids yearning to stay in the U.S.

Photos leaked Thursday from a U.S. Border Patrol facility in the Rio Grande Valley show overflowing holding facilities of immigrants, many of whom are children

Over 400 children a day are coming and as many as 60,000 will cross the Mexican border illegally this year

They then undergo physical and mental health evaluations, and are assigned a metal bunk from among the rows that line the walls of large barracks-style rooms.   

There is little need for storage because, as social workers put it, few of these children arrived with anything other than the clothes they wore on their journey north.

The administration estimates it costs taxpayers $252 per child per day.

'The reasons, as we understand them, that contribute to this dramatic increase have to do with economic conditions in those countries, sustained violence in these countries, and the desire of these children to be reunited with family members in the United States,' Celia Munoz, the White House Domestic Policy Adviser said.
