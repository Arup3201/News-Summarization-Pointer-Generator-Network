Arsene Wenger admits he may look to solve a defensive midfield problem at Arsenal by utilising fit-again Frenchman Abou Diaby.

The 6'3" schemer made another comeback for the club in the Capital One Cup defeat to Southampton on Tuesday, playing in a deeper role.

And with Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini flattering to deceive so far this season, Wenger says he believes Diaby can occupy the role in the future.

'I tried to develop [Diaby] in a deeper role, I think he can do it. He can be very interesting because he has all the attributes to do it,' Wenger is quoted as saying by Goal. 'After, he must love it as well because he's more of an offensive-minded player,'

'I try to transform it, yes because I feel because he was injured for a long time and he has the physical potential to win the challenges, to face the game will be easier for him than to play with his back to goal with the injuries he had.'

Flamini was signed on a free transfer from AC Milan last season but was off the pace during Arsenal's 2-2 draw with Manchester City, while fans criticised Mikel Arteta's performance against Dortmund in the Champions League.

Diaby has suffered a grand total of 40 injuries during his eight-year stay at the Emirates Stadium, most recently recovering from ruptured knee ligaments.

The 28-year-old played 60 minutes against Southampton and Wenger conceded that he will need time before he is featuring regularly in the first team.
