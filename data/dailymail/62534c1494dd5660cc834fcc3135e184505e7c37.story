When carrying out a daylight robbery, a good getaway vehicle is essential.

So one might question why these two burglars used a scooter to transport the safe they had just ripped out of a house.

The picture was taken by a  passer-by moments after the pair had broken into a property in Beckenham, Kent, and rode off with the safe containing £2,000 of jewellery.

Brazen: The two thieves use a scooter to haul away the stolen safe from the family home in Beckenham, making off with £2,000 worth of jewellery

Owner Natasha Rayasam, 33, has now 
offered a £500 reward for the safe return of her family heirlooms, which
included her wedding rings, along with 17 pieces of 22 carat gold 
jewellery.

Ms Rayasam believes the pair used a metal detector to locate the 176lbs safe, which was bolted to floor of a wardrobe in the master bedroom, because no other valuables were taken during the burglary.

She told the Evening Standard: 'They went straight to the wardrobe of the master bedroom and then to the study where they found our safe, which was bolted to the floor of a wardrobe.

'We think they used a metal detector to find it. I don’t know how they removed it. They didn’t touch anything else in the house - laptops or phones. All they wanted was the jewellery.'

Ms Rayasam, who was on holiday in 
India at the time of the break in, is still reeling from the July 28 
buglary, and has offered up the award in a bid to encourage witnesses to
come forward.

She 
added: 'It isn’t how expensive the jewellery is that matters, it is the 
sentimental value. It is all my wedding jewellery, and all the jewellery
given to me for my children. My father passed away in May and much of 
it is from him. It is causing me huge distress.'

Detective
Sergeant Stuart Roberts, who is leading the investigation, said: 'I am 
appealing for anyone who was in the area of Park Road, Beckenham at 
around 11.30hrs on 28 July and saw two men carrying a box or safe away 
from an address.

'The two men then left the scene on a moped, carrying the box on the seat between them.'
