The robbery of a South African news team has sent shock waves through the country after the brazen muggers were filmed on the crew's camera stealing their equipment at gunpoint.

Vuyo Mvoko, a contributing editor for SABC News, was preparing for a 7pm live report outside Johannesburg's Milpark Hospital when the incident occurred.

Footage of the robbery shows him standing under lights and in front of the camera, while two men can be seen walking past in the background.

At first he ignores them, but when they double back claiming to have a gun, Mr Mvoko's live cross is disrupted.

The men can then be seen demanding Mr Mvoko's mobile phone before also taking a collection of the crew's possessions and their work laptop.

In a later interview with a SABC News host, Mr Mvoko said they had spotted his phone, which was still in his hand after just having spoken to his producer in anticipation of going live on the news bulletin.

He added: 'So I gave him the phone, then I think they took about two or three phones. And the laptop we were using to do the (live) crossing. Then they just disappeared.'

Mr Mvoko also tweeted a link to the video of the robbery, stating: 'I'm Safe & sound. Here's how it all happnd (sic).'

Police did eventually arrive and have vowed to track down the men responsible.

Lieutenant-general Lesetja Mothiba, the Gauteng Provincial Commissioner, said police were 'shocked at the brazen nature of the crime'.

Mr Mvoko later tweeted a link to the mugging video (pictured) and said he was 'safe and sound'

A police spokesperson said that minutes after the robbery the news crew spotted and approached a policeman who happened to be driving past.

Despite driving around the area in an attempt to find the men responsible, they were unable to locate them and a case of robbery and theft was opened.

The South African National Editors' Forum appealed to anyone who recognized the assailants from the video footage to alert police to their identities.

'Every South African lives with the reality of crime, but to see thugs brazenly ignoring television cameras and robbing media workers in the course of their work, yet again brings home the level of criminality in our society,' the editors' group said in a statement.

Mr Mvoko was reporting from outside the following reports that Zambian President Edgar Lungu was being treated there after traveling to South Africa for medical care.
