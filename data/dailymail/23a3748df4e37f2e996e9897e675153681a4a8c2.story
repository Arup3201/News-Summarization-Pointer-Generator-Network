Humane Society officials are looking for the slimy fiend who duct-taped a turtle to a bunch of balloons and sent it floating above a Southern California neighbourhood.

Residents in Oceanside were looking at a set of balloons that had become stuck in a eucalyptus tree on Sunday, and were stunned to find the turtle dangling.

The creature, undoubtedly scared, was caught on video frantically moving its legs in an effort to escape the helium-filled confinement.

Hanging out: The turtle was found dangling from nearly two dozen balloons after they got caught in a tree

Help: The fire department was called to rescue the scared turtle, who was seen on video frantically waving his legs

Good save: A Humane Society official cut the turtle free with a knife

Resident Chanelle Wright told KGTV: 'We look up and there's green and blue balloons up there. He was just swinging his arms trying to get out of it. Somebody had taped him to the balloons.'

Ms Wright said she called the Humane Society and Fire Department, who arrived about an hour later.

Firefighters were about to rescue the turtle with a ladder truck when a gust of wind came and blew it back to the ground.

A Humane Society officer, who said the reptile was a box turtle, then cut it free with a knife.

In good hands: The Humane Society said they are keeping the turtle, which wasn't hurt, while they conduct their investigation

The organisation said they are keeping the turtle, which wasn't hurt, while they conduct an investigation.

If the culprit or culprits are found, they could face animal abuse charges.

Residents, meanwhile, were shocked that an animal could be so mistreated.

A new home: Chanelle Wright says she would like to adopt the turtle if no one else comes forward

Joel Rabagos told KGTV: 'What were you thinking? I mean, a turtle is still life. There's no reason to be putting him up in a balloon and sending him off.'

Ms Wright said she was horrified by the whole situation and plans to adopt the turtle if no one else claims it.

She told KGTV: 'I am going to call to see if the turtle's thereâ€¦ I'm going to get my turtle.'
