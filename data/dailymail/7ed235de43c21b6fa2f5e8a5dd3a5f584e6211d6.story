'Great crime': Tristram Hunt says his party created a culture of low expectations for state school pupils

Labour created a culture of low expectations for state school pupils, Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, has admitted.

He said it was a ‘great crime’ that the last government had failed to pushed children more than simply aim for them to achieve a C grade at GCSE level.

He also admitted that exams had been dumbed down in recent years, saying ‘yes, there are elements of grade inflation’.

Labour now wants to introduce licences for teachers, stripping them of their right to be in the classroom if they fail assessments carried out every five years.

In a startlingly frank admission, Mr Hunt said: ‘The great crime was an awful lot of effort being put on kids getting a C at GCSE, then not going further. There should be no limits - the system should be saying how far can this child go?’

Schools were too focused on the pass grade, ‘C’, because of its significance in league tables.

He said that education should not just be about exam results.

‘What do people who send their children to private school want? It’s not just smaller class sizes. It’s the playing fields and the after-school stuff like music and drama because they help to build confidence and character.’

He told the Times: ‘We need to work out how we can generate all those elements for everyone within a broad education and value them alongside academic rigour.’

Labour would not shut surviving grammar schools but Mr Hunt said their social mix should be questioned.

‘If they are simply about merit why do we see the kind of demographics and class make-up within them?’

Instead of focusing on a handful of specialist schools, he called for the whole system to be more aspirational.

A source close to Mr Gove said that Mr Hunt was ‘right’ to acknowledge mistakes with league tables, adding: ‘We’re getting rid of the five A* to C league-table measure that lay behind it. In future, league tables will be based on progress across eight subjects - so no more focus on the C/D borderline.’

Labour has also revived its plans to licence teachers in the same way that doctors and lawyers are regulated.

‘You need a critical mass of good teachers,’ Mr Hunt said. ‘The quality of an education system cannot be greater than the quality of its teachers.’

Under his plans, teachers would have their lessons assessed by other teachers to demonstrate they were keeping pace.

A new Royal College of Teaching would supervise the licencing regime.

He said while bad teachers could currently be fired, there was a lot of ‘recycling’ where they were simply hired by another school.

‘There is usually a collection of teachers who are not at the cutting edge and this is a check upon that. If a teacher has left one school but then gets a renewed enthusiasm, great, but they would need to pass the re-licensing a s a sign of confidence.’

Mr Hunt, who has been tipped as a future leader, was privately educated at £15,000-a-year University College School in North London and has a PhD from Cambridge.

He has previously said he would not rule out sending his own children to private school, although his son currently attends a state school in London.

Mr Hunt favours a return to the ‘basics’ in education and wants more children to read the classics and study Latin.
