He said: 'I started playing guitar when I was around 10 years old and I have always loved music.

'Both my brother and my dad played guitar, so when I grew up there was always a guitar round the house, so i just picked it up and went from there really.

'I like to do challenging covers. I don't like just simply recreating the song, I like to put my spin on it, if you listen to my original songs they are not really like R. Kelly.

'I uploaded the video on Tuesday and I was at my friends house later that night and my phone was just going crazy, I just kept checking and it's crazy.

'All my family and friends have been amazing, all helping me out with whatever I need, they are all really happy for me because they know me and they know how much I love my music.

'Right now it's not really sunk in to be honest with you, it's surreal before this video my highest number on views was 4,000 and I was extremely happy with that so this has blown my mind.

'I am just seeing what comes and trying to keep a level head.'
