Calls for more racially diverse emojis – cartoon-like pictograms used in text messages and apps - have been going on for over a year.

And now the Unicode Consortium, which sets the standards for emojis, is considering adding five new skin colours to its library of icons.

Users will be able to choose an emoji's skin colour that best reflects their own at the touch of a smartphone button, if the plans go ahead.

The default emoji face was designed to be generic, but is Caucasian, rather than an unrealistic shade such as bright yellow, leading people, including Miley Cyrus, to call for changes to better reflect global diversity.

The proposal is still under review but could lead to changes for millions of users as many operating systems are based on Unicode standards.

'People all over the world want to have emoji that reflect more human diversity, especially for skin tone,' according to the organisation's report.

A proposal to expand the skin color options for emojis (pictuerd) may get the thumbs up from those calling for more diversity in the icons. The default emoji face was designed to be generic, but is Caucasian, rather than an unrealistic shade such as bright yellow

A study in April found that the top trending word of the year, so far, is emoji.

Emojis are the small digital images used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication - which are continuing to spread like wildfire online.

The words and phrases were plucked from among millions used online in social media, blogs and global media.

Other terms to make the list include 'futebol’, and 'ghost plane' - relating to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. 

The proposed update reveals that users will be able to press and hold a button down on their smartphone to choose an emoji’s skin colour.

It says: ‘Unicode Version 8.0 is adding five symbol modifier characters that provide for a range of skin tones for human emoji.

‘These characters are based on the six tones of the Fitzpatrick scale, a recognised standard for dermatology. The exact shades may vary between implementations.’

If the proposal goes through, people who can’t see colour on their screens, will be able to see the intended colour of an emoji.

Emojis (pictured) were originally popular in Japan. Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture'(e) + 'letter' (moji)

Emojis were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online. However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere.

Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture'
 (e) + 'letter' (moji).

Icons
 are standardised and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as
 a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a mask, a white
 flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emojis  representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese 
curry, and sushi.

Some 
emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them 
to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could now be added.

Twitter allowed emojis to be used on its web version, as well across its apps, in June.
