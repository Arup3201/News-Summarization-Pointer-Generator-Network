Time for change: Morpurgo, above, said the reintroduction of story time would give children the opportunity to contemplate stories, instead of using them as tools

Author Michael Morpurgo has called on the education secretary Michael Gove to reintroduce 'story time' in schools, saying children need the time during their working day for 'contemplation'.

The former children's laureate and author of  War Horse, said listening sessions where students are not tested on what they have heard would teach young people to rediscover their love for reading.

Morpurgo, himself a former teacher, said he believes books are primarily to be enjoyed and that the current education system makes texts seem like working tools which are used solely to improve English.

In a direct message to the education minister, the writer said a change in culture was required to change attitudes towards reading.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'You cannot force this medicine down their throats and say "you have to learn this because you’re going to be tested on it".'

'It’s really, really important for 
children to have these moments in the school day for contemplation, there must be no questions afterwards, no comprehension exercises
and no testing.

'I would like to see it in every school in the country, Mr Gove.'

Morpurgo, 70, was speaking at the opening of a new new library, built at Brackenbury Primary School, west London, after parents raised £95,000 in funds.

They held a series of cake sales, sponsored walks and charity auctions, with a local building contractor offering to work with the school at a discount.

Morpurgo said he felt 'very, very strongly' about the need to give children the time to 'come to stories'.

Kevin
Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, 
said ideas such as reinstating story time could 'certainly help' to 
instill a love of reading in children and are 'worth discussing'.

Mail Online has contacted the department for education for reaction to Mr Morpurgo's comments.
