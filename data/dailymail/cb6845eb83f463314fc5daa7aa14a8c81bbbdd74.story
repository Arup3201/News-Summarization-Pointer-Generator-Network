Alan Davies tonight apologised to Lord McAlpine for naming him over false child abuse allegations.

The 46-year-old BBC comedian wrote to the former Tory politician, whose legal team is continuing its process of suing everybody who wrongly linked him to allegations of historic child abuse.

The claims were sparked by a Newsnight report which did not name Lord McAlpine but referred to a senior Conservative from the Thatcher era, leading to his identification online.

Mr Davies told his 444,000 followers on Twitter: ‘I've just written to Lord McAlpine to apologise for retweeting his name in relation to false allegations following a BBC investigation.’

It came after the Jonathan Creek and QI star had tweeted: ‘Any clues as to who the Tory paedophile is?’ and then retweeted a response naming Lord McAlpine.

Last week the BBC agreed to pay the peer £185,000 for wrongly implicating him in a paedophile ring that targeted children at the care home in Wrexham, north Wales.

But Twitter users had already taken to the website to tweet or retweet the libellous allegations.

Sally Bercow, the outspoken wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow, is another Twitter user who Lord McAlpine's lawyers are considering suing.

Mrs Bercow wrote on November 4: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*.’ But she has defended her tweet, describing it as not libellous - ‘just foolish’.

Then on Friday she tweeted: ‘Yes had letter from Lord McA. His lawyers ambulance chasers tbh [to be honest] #bigbullies.’

She later added: ‘I don’t have money to contest a multi-millionaire. Lord McA falsely accused but not by me.

‘Loving my trial by tabloid, mind. I never said Lord McAlpine paedophile – just noted he trending. Nor did I tweet about *that* Newsnight. This is totally politically motivated, I tell you. And I don’t do conspiracy theories as a rule.’

She went on: ‘Night twitter. Off to cuddle up with my lovely husband who takes so much **** (often on my behalf) #poor John #topspeaker #greatmanontoast.’

The peer's solicitor, Andrew Reid, has said action will be taken against ‘a lot of people’ who linked the former politician's name with the unfounded allegations.

He has also previously confirmed that a ‘very long list’ of Twitter users had been compiled which included Mrs Bercow and journalist George Monbiot, who has already apologised.

to David Cameron - which Lord McAlpine's lawyer says 'destroyed' his 
client's reputation in the process

Lord McAlpine is also seeking damages 
from ITV, which sparked fury after This Morning presenter Phillip 
Schofield confronted the Prime Minister with a list of names of alleged 
abusers.

Mr Schofield had 
found the names on the internet and asked David Cameron if he would 
investigate. The peer's legal team have said they want more from ITV than 
the £185,000 paid by the BBC.

'He would be looking for substantially more damages (from ITV) than the £185,000 he got from the BBC because it is a large private organisation and not taxpayer-funded. Up to £500,000 is what they are looking at'

Mr Reid said the presenter 'embarrassed the Prime 
Minister and destroyed the reputation of my client' and has sent a 
15-page letter to ITV encouraging them to settle.

The
former Tory treasurer said because the BBC is publicly-funded he 
tempered the claim made against them. But because ITV is a private 
company he is looking for a huge damages deal.

A
source close to the peer told MailOnline: ‘He would be looking for 
substantially more damages than the £185,000 he got from the BBC because
it is a large private organisation and not taxpayer-funded. Up to 
£500,000 is what they are looking at.'

Lawyers said the Lord McAlpine, pictured, case could potentially involve the largest number of defendants in British legal history

The
peer’s lawyers have identified 1,000 ‘original’ tweets and a further 
9,000 retweets, which is when a user re-posts a comment sent to them.

'Twitter is not a place where you can gossip and say the nastiest things possible with impunity'

About 40 of these potential defendants have so far approached the peer’s lawyers to apologise.

Mr
Reid previously warned that tweeters, even those who deleted their 
accounts or messages, will be contacted so should come forward.

He added that it was time to clamp down on Twitter, which allowed people to say 'vile, disgusting' things.

'We
have been inundated by the public who have wanted us to deal with this 
problem of Twitter, and have encouraged and in some cases have actually 
offered us funds,’ he said.

'Twitter is not a place where you can gossip and say the nastiest things possible with impunity.

BBC controversy: Lord McAlpine announced last week that he is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile after BBC's Newsnight broadcast the wrong claims

Mistake: Sally Bercow took to Twitter to comment on speculation as to the identity of the Tory at the centre of a Newsnight investigation and could be sued

'We've
been watching people who have been taking down what they put on 
Twitter. What they don't seem to understand is that once it's there, you
can't take it down and what's more we really have all the information.’

Twitter said that information about its users that is not public will not be revealed unless they are legally required to do so.

It
added that to obtain information that is not public – including the 
full name of the Twitter user and their address - would require a 
witness summons, a court order or another valid legal process.

Without
any of these, only the Twitter user’s ID – which could be a pseudonym –
and any other information they have willing disclosed will be 
available.

Lord McAlpine could now apply for an order which would enable them to obtain the private details of users who tweeted about him.

Christopher
Hutchings, a privacy lawyer, said: ‘In the case of Lord McAlpine, the 
mere seriousness of the libel would mean applying for a court order 
would be a straightforward application.’

His legal team plans to make each of them pay a nominal sum of possibly £5 to a children’s charity.

Morning presenter Phillip Schofield hands PM alleged Tory child abusers list

Friday November 2: Newsnight broadcasts a highly-anticipated investigation into historic abuse at a Welsh children's home. Victim Steve Messham (right) tells them a leading Thatcher-era Tory sexually abused him regularly. Lord McAlpine is never named but the programme leads to huge speculation online and he is named by thousands on Twitter as the subject of the report.

Tuesday November 6: Home Secretary Theresa May announces a police inquiry and a separate judge-led inquiry

Thursday November 8: In a now infamous exchange David Cameron is confronted by Phillip Schofield on This Morning, who produces a list of names he found online  - which is picked up by a camera - and hands it to his guest.

The flustered PM (below right) does not look at the list, and told the presenter 'there is a danger this could turn into a witch-hunt, particularly against people who are gay' and says anyone abused should go straight to the police.

Friday November 9: The credibility of the BBC Newsnight report collapses when The Guardian names Lord McAlpine as the subject of the botched probe and lists many reasons why he is a victim of 'mistaken identity'.

The corporation now apologises for the investigation, admits it had wrongly focused on Lord McAlpine, admitting all allegations made against him are untrue. All Newsnight investigations also stopped.

Victim Steve Messham then admits it is a case of mistaken identity, adding police showed him a picture of his abuser but had falsely said to him the man who abused him was Lord McAlpine.

The Tory peer also releases statement saying any links to him are 'wholly false and seriously defamatory'.

Saturday November 10: Director general George Entwistle has series of disastrous interviews on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 5Live and admits he did not see the Newsnight show, had missed all tweets linked to it and also the Guardian front page from the day before.

That evening he resigns and receives a £450,000 pay-off for doing the 'honourable thing' after just 54 days in the job.

Monday November 12: Lord McAlpine's legal team start putting together list of people who defamed their client and employ specialist firms to trawl Twitter for those people who named the peer online as a paedophile.

Friday November 16: BBC agrees settlement of £185,000 with Lord McAlpine who also 
breaks silence and says that he will never recover from false 
allegations. His lawyer Andrew Reid warns they will pursue every person 
who named his client online during frenzy, naming Sally Bercow (right) as 
example of someone who must apologise and settle. Reid also says ITV will be next target as he claims that the Schofield incident 'destroyed' McAlpine's reputation.
