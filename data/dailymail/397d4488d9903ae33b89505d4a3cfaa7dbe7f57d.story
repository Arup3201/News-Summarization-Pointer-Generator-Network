Arsenal footballer Andre Santos was banned from driving for 12 months today after admitting speeding away from chasing police at up to 140 miles per hour because he was late for training.

The 29-year-old Brazilian international weaved in and out of rush-hour traffic on the A1 dual carriageway and M25 motorway in his £110,000 Maserati GranTurismo supercar on August 17 as he travelled to the club's London Colney training ground.

Santos repeatedly failed to stop despite being chased 'for some considerable time' by a marked police car with sirens and blue flashing lights, magistrates were told.

Andre Santos appeared at Hendon Magistrates Court today (pictured). The Brazilian defender, who plays for Arsenal, was banned for 12 months after admitting driving without due care and attention

When he was eventually arrested yards from the training ground in Hertfordshire he told officers his blaring music had prevented him spotting them.

Santos, who wore a smart navy suit and dark tie, denied a charge of dangerous driving but admitted the lesser charge driving without due care and attention when he appeared at Hendon Magistrates Court today.

The more serious dangerous driving charge was subsequently dropped.

Magistrates banned him from the roads for 12 months and fined him £3,600 after ruling that he 'prioritised his own journey over his duty to drive in a safe manner.'

Inder Gohlar, prosecuting, told the court the footballer was spotted on the A1 'accelerating hard' away from a speed camera.

Police driver PC Chris Hurt put on his sirens and sped up to 120 mph to try and catch up to Santos who was travelling in the region of 140 mph.

Ms Gohlar said: 'It was then he realised the driver had no intention of stopping for the officers.

'The Maserati was very rapidly pulling away from them.

He (PC Hurt) took his car up to just below 120 mph and the Maserati was still pulling away from him.

'He estimated that he was doing in the region of 135 to 140 mph.'

The court heard Santos pulled on to the M25 and began weaving in between lanes, causing a danger to other road users.

Ms Gohlar said: 'The road was busy and other drivers were breaking sharply to avoid contact with him.

'The driver again forced his way back to the nearside lane having no regard for other road users and forced the drivers to break in order to avoid an accident.

'He then exited at a junction and in doing so the driver nearly lost control.'

Police officers eventually caught up with him close to Arsenal's training ground and shouted through the window for him to stop.

He was arrested and taken to a police station where he told officers he had been in a rush to get to training and did not realise they were following him.

In a statement, he said: 'My music was very loud and I was not paying attention.

'I very much regret driving in this way and I apologise to the police for the trouble I've caused.'

The court heard Arsenal Football Club will punish the player, but he was supported in the dock by a club interpreter.

A statement was read from Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger in which he described Santos as

'friendly, considerate and helpful,' and a player who 'contributes to the life of the club and undertakes charitable work within the community on behalf of the club.'

Alexandra Ward, in miitgation, told the court Santos was 'embarrassed and ashamed' to be before the courts.

Banning the father-of-one - who owns several high-powered cars plus a tiny Smart Car for shopping - Chair Golda Rosen said: 'Given your high speed and the manoevres undertaken and the extended period of this driving we must disqualify you today for a period of 12 months.'

Santos, who joined the Gunners last year from Turkish side Fenerbahce, was arrested on the eve of the Premier League season as Arsenal prepared for their opening game against Sunderland at the Emirates stadium.

Arsenal footballer Andre Santos said he was 'truly sorry' for speeding away from the police at speeds of up to 140 miles per hour.

He said he had learned a 'tough lesson.'

Speaking outside court, Santos' solicitor David Sleight said: 'Mr Santos would like to apologise for the careless driving that led to his court case today.

'He has learned a tough lesson and accepts the sentence that the court has passed.

'He is truly sorry and disappointed to let himself and Arsenal Football Club down in this way.'
