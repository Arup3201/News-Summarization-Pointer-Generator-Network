Victim: Linda Bull, pictured here when she was 21, was raped and strangled by Arthur Duncan in 1970

A convicted murderer and rapist is in line for compensation after a court ruled that his human rights were breached when he was not given rehabilitation treatment in jail.

Arthur Duncan, who raped and strangled Linda Bull, claimed he had no access to sexual offenders' rehabilitation programmes for a period of five years.

His victim's family described the decision to back his claim as a 'kick in the teeth'.

One of the UK's longest-serving prisoners, Duncan raped Miss Bull, 22, then strangled her with her tights in 1970, when he was 18.

He is serving a life term and has repeatedly been refused parole to protect the public since the murder in Andover, Hampshire. But, to the horror of his victim's family, he is now in line for a payout.

'My parents' lives were left in devastation after losing their daughter in such a horrific way and they were never the same,' said Shelagh Paynter, Miss Bull's sister. 'We were never offered counselling or compensation, yet the criminal seems to have the help.

'We aren't asking for anything, but our lives have been in turmoil. We are the victims here and we didn't get anything, so why should he? It's disgusting.'

Mrs Paynter, 62, a retired social worker who lives in Dorset, said criminals who commit such heinous crimes should forfeit their human rights.

'We have all suffered because of what happened and we will continue to suffer but hearing that he is in line for a payout is just a kick in the teeth,' she said.

'I am horrified. He is a bad person and will ask for anything he can, but the biggest issue for me is that a worker in the system has obviously told him he has these rights.

'And to think a judge has then ruled in his favour is such an injustice.'

Mrs Paynter, who said the case had brought back the pain of her sister's murder, said the family was planning to write to the judge 'to try and stop this from happening'.

Duncan claimed his rights under article five of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects liberty and security, were breached when he had no chance to access sexual offenders' programmes between April 2007 and July last year.

Officials argued that there had been no failures and that progress through rehabilitation was 'very much a matter of judgment for the prison authorities'.

They said fantasies involving bondage and non-consensual sex offending had been 'an ongoing issue'. But judge Lord Glennie ruled in Duncan's favour last month.

He said officials had 'simply failed to provide him with programmes and courses which they themselves recognised were a necessary part of his rehabilitation'.

He also said they were necessary 'to enable him to make progress towards having an effective review before the parole board'.

The judge said a further hearing should take place before a final decision is made.

Duncan has repeatedly been caught with hardcore pornography. He was once found with  brides' photos cut from a local paper – with their addresses on the back.

He later admitted to fantasising about going to one of the women's homes and tying her up. He has been moved around Scottish jails ever since and is now a prisoner at Glenochil near Stirling.

It is believed that Duncan would have brought his case using taxpayer-funded legal aid, although this was unconfirmed last night.

He was a soldier in the Royal Artillery when he attacked Miss Bull close to her home at night. He then took a photograph from the victim's handbag 'to see what she looked like'.

A psychiatrist believed Duncan had an abnormal mind because of 'sexual oddities and sadistic fantasies'. In 2002 a judge ruled he should serve a minimum of 10 years in jail before he can seek release.

A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said it was inappropriate to comment as a further hearing is due.
