He might have only just learned to write his own name, but Wayne Rooney's five-year-old son Kai had an opportunity to show off his skills with a pen when signing autographs at Old Trafford on Sunday.

The Manchester United captain's son was mascot for the 3-0 Barclays Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur, and his dad's celebrity status seems to be rubbing off a little - at least in the eyes of Manchester's autograph hunters.

Kai was spotted signing for fans by the Old Trafford dug-out before his dad netted United's third in the comprehensive victory that kept United in the Premier League's top four which will be remembered for Rooney's 'knockout' celebration.

Rooney wrapped up United's first-half scoring,  with a celebration  choreographed after Sunday newspaper reports pictured him appearing to be knocked out by his friend, Stoke City's Phil Bardsley, during an easy-going boxing session.

Nabli Bentaleb  presented the ball straight to Rooney 10 minutes before half-time and the United captain surged forwards to hold off two players before beating Hugo Lloris with his left instep.

Rooney ran towards the corner flag, aiming three punches at thin air before falling backwards to the turf as if knocked out in a predictable but amusing celebration.

It was a vital win for the home side who clung on to a two-point lead over Liverpool in fourth place, with England's two biggest clubs set to face each other at Anfield on Sunday in what is being billed as a potential Champions League qualification decider.Â
