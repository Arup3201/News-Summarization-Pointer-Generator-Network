A rider was crushed to death when a horse he was riding rolled on top of him during a horse trial event yesterday.

The 25-year-old had been competing in Somerford Park Horse Trials in Congleton, Cheshire, when the horse failed to jump an obstacle.

The horse’s front legs became caught, causing them both to fall forward over a bar and the horse fell on the rider causing fatal injuries.

Spectators were watching the event in horror when the man, from New Zealand, died at around 3pm yesterday afternoon.

The three-part competition was held over the weekend and included events in dressage, cross country and show jumping.

The event had been organised to raise money for the air ambulance service.

Organisers immediately abandoned the competition after the tragedy.

A Cheshire police spokesman said: ‘We can confirm a 25-year-old man was killed at an equestrian event in a "rotational fall" at Somerford Park in Cheshire.

‘It is a dangerous event and on this occasion a man was fatally injured.’

The spokesman confirmed the man was from New Zealand and police were still trying to contact his family.

In a statement from British Eventing, BE Chief Executive Mike Etherington-Smith said: ‘We would ask that at this extremely sad time that people using social media respect the fact that the rider’s family may not be aware of the accident today.’

Friends took to Twitter to express their sadness at the man’s death.

Ginny Wells wrote: ‘Such a devastating way to end a lovely event at somerford. My thoughts go out to his family in this difficult time.’

Laura Wallace said: ‘Cannot believe that one of my best friends is no longer with us after Somerford today. I loved you so much. RIP my dear xxxx’
