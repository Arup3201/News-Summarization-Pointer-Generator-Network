If there was a sex scandal swirling around Prince Andrew it didn’t show yesterday as he returned to royal duties after an attempt to have him testify  about underage 'sex slave' Virginia Roberts failed.

He was photographed laughing heartily in front of a Union Jack as he donned his naval uniform for a ceremony at RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset.

The prince has vehemently denied allegations in the US that he slept with 17-year-old Virginia Roberts, who alleges she was ‘procured’ for him by his close friend, convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Back to work: The Duke of York laughs during a visit to Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, Somerset, today as it emerged a second attempt to have him testify on oath over sex claims failed

Last week, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he broke his silence on the controversy, saying he wanted to ‘reiterate and reaffirm’ Buckingham Palace statements that insist he never had any kind of sexual contact or relationship with his accuser. 

Since then the prince has tried to put the scandal to one side with a ‘business as usual approach’ to his public duties, which yesterday involved presenting four Royal Navy helicopter pilots and two observers with their wings. 

Miss Roberts, who claims she had sex three times with the Duke of York when she was 17, a claim he emphatically denies, served papers on him via the British Embassy in Washington but they were returned to sender.

Dressed in uniform he said: 'Just being here today at one of these very, very important ceremonies in the life of the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm brought back memories to me when I was stood where these young people were a long time ago'.

But he did not mention the sex allegations a week after his public denial in Davos.

A female Royal Navy pilot from Staffordshire made history as she received her Wings from Prince Andrew.

Lieutenant Danielle Welch, 30, is the very first and last woman to become a Royal Navy abinitio Lynx pilot.

She was awarded her Wings by the Duke of York during a ceremony at RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset after five-and-a-half years' training.

She said: 'My family and friends are all very proud.

'This is something I have been trying to achieve for most of my life and when I found out I had been selected it was brilliant.

'The course is tough. We started the Lynx course with six and we've ended with four. Previous courses have a similar attrition rate.

'Not everyone gets through but to achieve it is brilliant.'

She added: 'I am deploying operationally this summer, so I am looking forward to doing the job I have been training for.'

Prince Andrew also presented Wings to Lieutenant Rhydian Edwards, who also qualified to fly the Lynx, and Lieutenants Thomas Lofthouse and Matthew Clark, who will fly the Sea King.

Lieutenant Max Crosby and Sub-Lieutenant Christian Smith received their observer wings.

The attempt by Miss Roberts' legal team to serve papers on Prince Andrew came a week after couriers FedEx returned a similar letter because it was 'refused' by the recipient at Buckingham Palace. 

The letter to the Prince says: 'This is a formal request to interview you under oath at a time and place of your choosing.'

The Foreign Office has said they refused to take the legal papers because sending them to a British Embassy was not the 'appropriate way' to serve them.

A spokesman said: 'Documents were incorrectly sent to our embassy in Washington. As they were not served via the appropriate channels, we are returning the documents so they can be sent by the agreed international channels for the transmission of legal papers.'

Prince Andrew spoke for the first time last week to deny the sex accusations, at the World Economic Forum

The letter tops a damaging month for Andrew since he was sensationally accused in U.S. court papers of abusing Miss Roberts when she was 17.

She alleged that under the orders of billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, she was ‘forced’ to have sex with him three times in 2001 - in London, New York and on Epstein’s Caribbean island.

Andrew, 54, fiercely denies ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship’ with Miss Roberts and has consulted top criminal QC William Clegg. 

A week ago Andrew spoke publicly to deny that he had sex with Miss Roberts.

In an unprecedented move, he used a televised speech in Davos to 'reaffirm' Buckingham Palace's emphatic denials that he had ever had 'any form of sexual contact or relationship' with his accuser.

Reading from carefully scripted notes, the prince said: 'Firstly I think I must, and want, for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last few weeks.

'And I just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by Buckingham Palace.' 

Miss Roberts's lawyers sent Buckingham Palace a letter (above) requesting his 'voluntary cooperation in answering questions about his sexual interactions' with her - but it was not accepted

The royal had been under under growing pressure to speak about the case.

His accuser lodged fresh documents at a Florida court saying her lawyers had served an extraordinary letter on the Duke last week requesting he answer questions – but he ‘refused’ to accept it.

Miss Roberts also issued a stinging attack on ‘false and hurtful’ denials of her claims made by Andrew in the tumultuous past three weeks.

She claimed his police bodyguards left her alone with him the first time he had sex with her and that she was involved in an orgy with the prince and eight other young girls. 

Buckingham Palace has strenuously rejected claims the Duke had any ‘sexual contact or relationship’ with Miss Roberts.   

In her latest court salvo, Miss Roberts states: ‘I have seen Buckingham Palace’s recent “emphatic” denial that Prince Andrew had sexual contact with me. That denial is false and hurtful to me. I did have sexual contact with him as I have described…under oath'.
