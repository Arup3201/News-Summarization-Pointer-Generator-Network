A homeless man managed to sleep in a Cambridge University library for six weeks before staff noticed he was not a student.

The interloper took advantage of the 24-hour library at St John's College by 'tailgating' students entering the building for late-night study sessions before pretending to peruse books.

But he was rumbled after some noticed he never changed his clothes, was pretending to read books and often fell asleep and began snoring.

Fooled: The homeless man is believed to have slept at a St John's College library for six weeks before being kicked out

University authorities were alerted and he was ordered to leave by a porter after he could not prove he was a student.

One member of the college said on Twitter the man had been 'living under the radar' for six weeks but has not been seen since.

It is believed the man was homeless and simply seeking a warm place to spend the night.

The front door of St John's Working Library is unlocked when staffed, but locked outside these hours.

However students can get in and out of the library 24-hours a day, seven days a week, using their access card.

Â 'One member of the college said on Twitter the man had been 'living under the radar' for six weeks but has not been seen since.'

Students told The Cambridge Student newspaper he was frequently seen flicking through books in the History section, using the computer, but mostly seemed to be 'trying to look busy'.

Second year St John's medical student Casey Swerner said the mystery man approached her once and made vague claims of working on a PhD on the topic of 'how we perceive religious identity'.

Another, Ben Brindley, said: 'He used to pace around. He brought Sainsbury's bags in and ate there, and never changed his clothes.'

First year natural sciences student Charlie Dowell told the Daily Telegraph: 'People said he pretended to read things and would fall asleep in the audio-visual room.

'It's very English that it took weeks of students complaining among themselves, but to the right person, before he was kicked out.'

A spokesman for St John's College said: 'The presence of a male in the library was reported to the porters who asked him to leave when he was unable to identify himself as a student of the college. He has not been seen in St John's subsequently.'
