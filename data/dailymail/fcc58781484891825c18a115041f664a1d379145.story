President Barack Obama may send ground troops into Iraq, a senior White House official said this afternoon.

Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters accompanying the president on his vacation that Obama would consider sending in troops to help save thousands of Iraqis trapped on a mountain if that was the recommendation of 130 Marines and special forces sent in Tuesday to access the situation.

That action would be 'different than reintroducing U.S. forces in a combat role to take the fight to ISIL,' however, Rhodes claimed, according to the New York Times, because the troops' sole objective would be the humanitarian rescue mission.

'We don’t believe it’s sustainable to have 
permanent airdrops' of food and water, he said.

United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron also announced plans for an international rescue mission in Iraq today for the refugees who are 'exposed, starving and dying of thirst' on the mountain.

Cameron flew back from a vacation to Portugal a half a day early to participate in an emergency meeting about the crisis, saying afterward his country would 'play a role' in relief efforts.

The UK leader said 'detailed plans are now being put in place’ for the mission but declined to share them with reporters.

Another 130 U.S. troops arrived in 
Iraq on Tuesday on what the Pentagon described as a temporary mission to
 assess the scope of the humanitarian crisis facing thousands of 
displaced Iraqi civilians trapped on Sinjar Mountain and evaluate 
options for getting them out to safety.

'This is not a combat boots on the ground kind of operation,' Defense
 Secretary Chuck Hagel said in announcing the deployment yesterday in remarks to Marines at a Southern California base.

'We're not going back into Iraq in any of the same combat mission 
dimensions that we once were in in Iraq,' he added, referring to the 
eight-year war that cost more than 4,400 U.S. lives and soured the 
American public on military involvement in Iraq.

Another defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide additional details on the sensitive mission, told the Associated Press the extra troops were Marines and special operations forces whose mission was to assess the situation in the Sinjar area and to develop additional humanitarian assistance options beyond current U.S. efforts there.

A separate official told AP the mission for the130 troops could last less than one week.

That official also said that while the troops were not being sent in to execute some type of rescue mission of the Yazidis on the mountain, they would assess the feasibility of a rescue or what one might look like.

They would also assist in the ongoing effort to evaluate the use of airstrikes as part of the mission to protect the Yazidis from attacks by the Islamic State militants.

Hagel referred to the 130 as 'assessors.'

The additional troops arrived Tuesday in the city of Erbil, well east of Sinjar. They were to work with representatives of the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development to coordinate plans with international partners and non-government organizations to help the trapped Yazidi civilians on Sinjar Mountain.

'They will make a very rapid and critical assessment because we understand it's urgent to try to move those people off the mountain,' Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters traveling with him in Honiara, Solomon Islands.

The move shows the Obama administration is weighing the impact and implications of several days of targeted airstrikes on the Islamic State fighters and how that has affected U.S.-backed Kurdish forces opposing them in northern Iraq.

One immediate dilemma was the fate of thousands of displaced Yazidis in the Sinjar area who have been provided with food and water delivered by U.S. cargo planes in recent days.

Washington also was considering how to increase its military assistance to the Kurds, whose militia is outgunned by the militants.

The 130 were in addition to 90 U.S. military advisers already in Baghdad and 160 in a pair of operations centers — one in Erbil and one in Baghdad — working with Iraqi security forces.

They were in addition to about 455 U.S. security forces and 100 military personnel working in the Office of Security Cooperation in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

U.S. officials said that while Obama put caps on the number of troops deployed to Iraq, these latest forces were being sent under the authorization for humanitarian assistance and therefore did not exceed the limits.

President Barack Obama has said repeatedly he will not send ground combat forces back into Iraq. But Obama's assurances have done little to quell the concerns of Democrats who worry that repeated deployments of U.S. forces will result in mission creep.

'I oppose open-ended military commitments, which the president’s 
actions in Iraq could become,' Sen. Richard Blumenthal told The Hill last Friday.

'I am deeply concerned that these actions could lead to prolonged direct 
military involvement, which I would strongly oppose,' he said.

Sam Brannen, a former Pentagon official under Obama who now serves as a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies, told the Wall Street Journal that even a rescue mission like the one the administration is currently mulling could end up landing the U.S. back in Iraq militarily.

'This to me represents a dramatic 
escalation, and I think it deserves a little bit of thought to avoid 
exactly a Black Hawk down situation, where you think you're there for 
humanitarian reasons and suddenly you're there for a civil war,' he said.

On Saturday President Obama admitted that he had no timeline for the U.S. to cease its operations in Iraq.

'I’m not going to give a particular 
timetable, because as I’ve said from the start, wherever and whenever 
U.S. personnel and facilities are threatened, it’s my obligation, my 
responsibility as Commander-in-Chief, to make sure that they are 
protected,' he said.
