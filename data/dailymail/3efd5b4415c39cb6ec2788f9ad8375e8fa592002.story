An elderly couple who told neighbours they did not want to move into a care home have been found dead after apparently jumping from a block of flats.

Roy and Glenys Smith, both in their early 90s, were discovered at the foot of the apartment building in Bournemouth, Dorset, where they were housebound.

It is believed that they told neighbours of concerns about being put a home the night before their bodies were found by an assistant caretaker at Crag Head, a seafront apartment building.

The previous evening the frail couple, both in their early 90s and said to be housebound, said they did not want to have to go into a care home.

Death: Roy and Glenys Smith, who are in their 90s, were found dead outside this block of flats in Bournemouth

The couple, who are thought to have two sons, lived on the second floor of the building and are thought to have fallen around 30ft to their deaths.

An ambulance crew rushed to the apartment block but the pair were pronounced dead at the scene and police are not treating the deaths as suspicious.

Neighbour Mark Goldfinger, 83, said: 
'They were an elderly married couple who suffered from poor health in 
recent years. He lost his eyesight altogether about two years ago.

'It
 must have happened some time during the night because nobody in the 
flats saw or heard anything. Someone realised what had happened when 
they looked outside at about 8am.

'Their
 bodies had been covered up and then the police and ambulance arrived, 
taped off the area and took them away. It is very sad.

Tragedy: The elderly couple are believed to have killed themselves to avoid having to live in a care home

'They lived on the second floor but it wasn't an accident. They were elderly people and it would have been an effort to climb over the railings of the balcony.

'In the last five years they came out less and less as their health worsened. The husband always held on to his wife when they were out walking.'

Another neighbour, Ruth Burger, said: 'I didn't know them very well but I knew them enough to say hello to. They were very devoted to each other - they held hands everywhere they went.

'They were both very elderly and I don't think they were very well. What happened is tragic.

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I can't believe it - I'm very upset.

Housebound: The Smiths were often seen walking around holding hands, but were suffering from ill health

'The night previously they had spoken about not wanting to go to a home. The next thing anyone knew their bodies were lying on the grass outside the building. It's very distressing.'

Vivian Phillips, who is on the building's board of management, said: 'They have been living here for a long time - quite a few years.

'Up until last summer, you would see them together going for a walk. But recently, very unfortunately, they were more or less housebound. It is very sad indeed.'

A police spokesman said: 'Dorset Police were called at around 8.30am on Tuesday 3 December 2013 to a report of a man and a woman aged in their eighties and nineties having been found deceased outside a block of flats along Manor Road in Bournemouth.

'Officers attended along with an ambulance crew. There are no suspicious circumstances and the coroner has been made aware. Next of kin have been informed.'

Post mortem examinations were due to be conducted on the bodies today.
