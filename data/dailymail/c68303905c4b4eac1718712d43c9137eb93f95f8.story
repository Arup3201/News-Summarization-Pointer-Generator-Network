If you were sunbathing on a beach over the summer but could only think of buying your Christmas turkey, tinsel and tree you are not alone.

New research has confirmed the common complaint that the festive period starts earlier every year - August 19 to be exact.

According to a study by the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) internet searches for terms such as 'Santa Claus', 'elf and 'presents' now increase markedly during the summer holidays. 

Statisticians say this means are now thinking about Christmas almost three months earlier than in 2007.

Data analyst Nathan Cunningham looked at the volume of Christmas-related Google searches in each of the past six years. 

In doing so he managed to work out the probability of each week being defined as 'Christmas' or 'not Christmas using an algorithm he originally created for research into fossil pollen.

He found that from a relatively late start of November 11 in 2007, we turned our minds to Christmas as early as August 19 in 2012.

Christmas started on October 12 in 2008 and August 30 in 2009 before a slight delay to October 3 in 2010 and September 11 in 2011.

However the last two years have seen the start settle at August 19 and August 25.

Mr Cunningham's results are included in a paper entitled Does Christmas really come earlier every year?, which earned him a runner-up prize in this year's Young Statisticians Writing Competition organised by the RSS and Significance magazine.

Describing his findings as 'a little startling', Mr Cunningham said: 'From a seemingly late beginning of November 11 in 2007 we had begun turning our minds to thoughts of the festive season as early as August 25 in 2013.

'While this of course seems absurdly early it should be borne in mind that the beginning of the Christmas period here reflects a marked change in our mindsets to thoughts of Christmas, and not the beginning of the full-blown holiday season.

'Nevertheless, it would appear that the prevailing notion is correct: Christmas is indeed coming earlier every year.'

RSS executive director Hetan Shah said: 'This is a great example of using publicly-available statistics to take a fresh look at an age-old debate.

'Whilst many of us haven't even started our Christmas shopping yet, this study suggests people are turning their minds to the festive period earlier and earlier.'

Retailing giant Selfridges opened its Christmas store in early August with a scant 142 shopping days left to buy all the celebration's essentials.

The department store proudly claims to be the first in the world to launch its Christmas shop this year.

Clinton Cards decided to get the countdown to festive period under way in August when it started selling Christmas cards.

But the decision by one pub to put its tree up in August made customers upset. 

Manager Mike Robinson got into the festive spirit by putting up a 12ft tree at the Harvester Bybrook Barn restaurant in Ashford, Kent - despite there still being 140 days to go.

But Mr Robinson, who erected the tree to coincide with a Christmas promotion, took down the tree because the plan 'backfired'.
