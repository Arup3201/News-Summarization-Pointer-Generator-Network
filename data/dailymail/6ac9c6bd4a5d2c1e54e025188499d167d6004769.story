A former medical researcher's conviction for poisoning his neurologist wife with cyanide should be thrown out because he was convicted solely on circumstantial evidence, his attorney has said.

Robert Ferrante, 66, was this month sentenced to life in prison after  jurors in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, convicted him last autumn.

Prosecutors said he laced Dr Autumn Klein's energy drink with cyanide in April 2013.

Defense attorney Chris Eyster wrote in an appeal filed yesterday that prosecutors presented 'not one shred of evidence' that Ferrante administered poison to his wife.

'A conviction based on conjecture cannot stand,' he said.

Mr Eyster also argued that prosecutors failed to show that Klein, 41, had lethal amounts of cyanide in her blood, citing disagreement among expert witnesses as to whether she died of the poison or a sudden heart dysrhythmia.

As Ferrante was sent to prison for the rest of his life earlier this month, his mother-in-law said in a statement read in court that the murder had robbed her and her husband of their only child.

'The light of our lives has now been extinguished,' Lois Klein said.

The statement went on to say: 'I certainly don't want to give him any credit but he has certainly ruined our lives. 

'All she ever wanted to do was to be able to help people. People all over the world are now losers.'

Lois Klein and her husband, William, are now caring for their 8-year-old granddaughter, Cianna, in Maryland, according to the station WPXI.

On November 7 last year it took jurors 15 hours of deliberations spread over the course of two days to find the medical researcher guilty of first-degree murder.

Allegheny County prosecutors argued during Ferrante's high-profile trial that he deliberately laced his wife's creatine energy drink with cyanide. 

He had bought the poison through his lab using a university-issued charge card two days before she suddenly fell ill in late April 2013.

Dr Klein died three days later at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, despite doctors' efforts to save her.

His lawyers made the case that she might not have been poisoned at all, citing three defense experts who said that couldn't be conclusively proved.

Ferrante said the cyanide he bought was for stem cell experiments he was conducting on Lou Gehrig's disease, because the toxin can be used to kill of neurological cells and thus simulate the disease in the lab.

But prosecutors said Ferrante was a 'master manipulator' who concocted the plan to kill his wife after she pressured him to have a second child and because he may have feared she was having an affair or planned to divorce him.

Ferrante did online searches on cyanide poisoning and how it might be removed by the medical treatments Klein received or detected by a coroner after her death. 

A spokesman for District Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr. said the argument for a new trial 'is based on issues that have already been litigated.'
