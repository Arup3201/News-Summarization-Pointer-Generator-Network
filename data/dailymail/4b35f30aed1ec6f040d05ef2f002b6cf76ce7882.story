A 20-year-old man died from swine flu and pneumonia after a senior nurse at NHS Direct told him to go to the chemist instead of A&E.

The unnamed man, known only as Patient A, had called the hotline twice in two days complaining of diarrhoea and vomiting for six 
days. He also described a chesty cough and 
discoloured mucous.

But rather than following the advice on the computer, which said the man should go to A&E, Fadzai Jaravaza, a senior nurse advisor for NHS Direct Essex, instead told the  caller to get cough syrup from the chemist and treat himself.

Wrong diagnosis: A 20-year-old man died from swine flu and pneumonia on after a senior nurse at NHS Direct told him to go to the chemist instead of A&E

Ms Jaravaza, 
59, from Wickford, Essex, will now be struck off the nursing register 
after being found guilty of a string of professional misconduct charges 
by a Nursing and Midwifery Council fitness to practice panel.

This was one of seven counts of misconduct taken into consideration by the panel. Other accusations included failing to provide the correct care to patients complaining of chest pain, palpitations and breathing difficulties.

The panel heard that on Christmas Day 2010 she ignored advice from the system that the Patient A should go straight to A&E due to the severity of his symptoms.

With NHS Direct, operators offer advice based on the symptoms described through a computer system. 

The panel's report of the hearing said: 'On both occasions, Ms Jaravaza advised that Patient A should seek pharmacy advice and self-medicate.'

The panel was informed that Patient A 
was admitted to hospital the following day, Boxing Day, but died later 
that day following a provisional diagnosis of pneumonia secondary to 
H1N1 influenza (swine flu). 

The report added: 'There is evidence of lack of insight and a lack of engagement. Further, the panel considers that there is a real risk of repetition of Ms Jaravaza's failings which could lead to patient harm.'

Struck off: Ms Jaravaza was deemed no longer fit to practice at a hearing of the Nursing and Midwifery Council

Indeed, the panel heard that Ms Jaravaza had been monitored by managers since March that year after a series of unsatisfactory calls.

The report continued: 'It is the panel's finding that a period of suspension would not be sufficient to protect patients.

'The panel considers that a striking off order is the only sanction that is sufficient to protect patients and the public interest.

'The seriousness of the case, including the number and wide-ranging nature of the incidents, is incompatible with ongoing registration.'

Ms Jaravaza, who worked for NHS Direct since 2001, claimed during the probe that the problems were down to changes with the system in 2009.

She is also said to have refused to cooperate with the investigation or attend the hearing in London. She was given 28 days to appeal the decision before the strike off.
