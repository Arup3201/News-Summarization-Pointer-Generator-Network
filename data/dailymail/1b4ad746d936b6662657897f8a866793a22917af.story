Richard Mangino was a typical married father-of-three who had worked most of his life at Logan International Airport in Boston as a ground crew director.

But in 2002 - aged 55 - after developing kidney stones, he contracted sepsis, a terrible blood stream infection that doctors said would cause his four limbs to decay and inevitably fall off.

As his hands turned black, the passionate musician from Revere made the decision to have a quadruple amputation.

He quickly adjusted to life with prosthetic legs and arms with hooks at the end of them, first learning to put his glasses on, then drive and eventually even paint.

But over the years he longed to be able to do more - mostly to hold the hands of his two grandsons - and then he read that Brigham and Women's Hospital had performed numerous face transplants.

Dire: Richard Mangino's sepsis infection became so severe in 2002 his hands to decay and turn black

Amputation: With no other viable option, Mangino and his family made a decision - he would have all four limbs cut off and become a quadruple amputee

'She's been unbelievable': Richard Mangino relied on the strength of his wife Carole. The two have now been married 45 years

Improvements: Slowly the father-of-three started to teach himself how to do the things he always had using his hooks

Big step: The first major hurdle was learning to put his glasses on

Mental health: Mangino turned to his creativity for psychological support

After meeting with doctors, Mangino was told that, at 65, he was too old for the still-experimental surgery.

However his case was extensively reviewed and, noting Mangino's indefatigable spirit, the hospital decided to make an exception - they would give him new hands.

'My wife and I cried - everyone was crying,' Mangino said in an interview with Brigham and Women's Hospital.

'We knew this was it.'

The bilateral mid-forearm transplant lasted 12 hours.

Four teams had to work simultaneously.

Some people were involved in the operation, including 14 surgeons.

'A v-shaped incision is used to accommodate the swelling and to prevent scar contractor,' Dr Simon Talbot MD, one of the chief plastic surgeons on the case, explained.

'Next the bones are joined with metal plates and screws. And next the muscle, tendons, arteries, veins and three major nerves of the forearm are joined.'

Complex: The surgeons used metal rods and bolts to connect the arms, before attaching muscle, tendons, arteries, veins and three major nerves

'Pivotal': Surgeons say this was the defining moment of Mangino's surgery, as blood from his body starting coming out of the palm of his new hand, showing his body was accepting the transplant

The brain actually comes to the consider the new limbs as its own, doctors said.

The surgical team said they had a 'defining moment' during the landmark procedure, where blood started to come out of Mangino's new hand.

It showed his body had almost immediately accepted the transplant, or had achieved re-protrusion.

'Ive had a chance at a new life - to live and to hold my grandchildren. To hold my wife and my children.

'To do things as most people will do. I don't have to perform miracles anymore. I can just be a regular person.'

But Mangino was sure to point out that what happened to him was no marvel.

'It's not a miracle,' he said.

Back to it: Mangino is seen here doing chores one year after his transplant

Achievement: Richard Mangino manages to embrace his love for music again with his new hands, starting to play the piano

Content: Maybe one day he be able to play guitar ago. But for the moment Mangino is happy with the piano

Happy: Richard Mangino and his beloved grandsons

'These people worked very hard at what they did for me.'

Life since the surgery has become relatively 'normal' for Mangino, who has not only been able to play the piano again, but achieve his dream of playing with his grandchildren.

'I can now say hold my hand when we cross the street (to my grandson's), instead of hold my hook,' he said.

One day he may be able to pick up a guitar again, he told WCVB this week,  as the feeling in his fingers continues to increase over time, but at the moment Mangino said he's happy with the piano.
