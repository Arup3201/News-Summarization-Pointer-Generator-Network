After West Coast Eagles star Matt Priddis unexpectedly won the Brownlow medal for 2014 on Monday evening, many congratulations for the midfielder were splashed across social media.

But the conversation quickly took on a different, and hilarious turn.

Priddis, 29, who is known across the AFL for his curly mop of golden curls, had fans sharing pictures of Gene Wilder, Sideshow Bob and even Shirley Temple along with their well wishes for the star player.
