Eliot Spitzer, the one-time New York governor who resigned in disgrace after his involvement with high-price call girls became public in 2008, is getting back into politics. His bid to become New York City's next comptroller will be complicated, however: One of the two most prominent candidates opposing him is Kristin Davis, the madam who spent three months in prison for running the prostitution ring that counted Spitzer among its clients.

And with that announcement Sunday evening, the entire city of New York collectively set its DVRs to record what would otherwise be a boring autumn debate.

Spitzer, who spent roughly $80,000 on prostitutes before his political work came crashing down five years ago, told The Wall Street Journal that he plans to use the comptroller's office to audit city agencies, citing 'critical issues of judgment if we are spending our dollars wisely.'

He will need to collect 3,750 signatures from New York City voters by July 11 - just four days away - to put his name on the ballot. I am going to be on the street corners,' Spitzer told The New York Times without a hint of irony. 'We will be out across the city.'

A tale of two candidates: Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer (L) is back in the political limelight after his resignation in 2008 over a call-girl scandal. Kristin Davis (R) was the madam who supplied him with prostitutes. hooker. They're both running for New York City comptroller

Ashley Alexandra Dupree was Spitzer's favorite call girl. The two romped in room 817 of the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. on several occasions, according to federal court documents

Kristen Davis, a former hedge fund manager-turned-madam, announced her candidacy for the same post in April, and won the endorsement of the Libertarian Party to fly its banner on Election Day.

'Bring it on,' she told reporters when the news broke. 'Gosh, it’s going to be a fun race!'

Davis has already said she plans to make Spitzer's past association with her ladies of the evening a central campaign issue, saying that 'it would be a disgrace for the City of New York to allow an unpunished criminal who committed multiple felonies to be re-elected back into office.'

She tweeted a reminder on Sunday evening that it was Spitzer who, as governor in 2007, signed a bill into law that 'made it a felony 4 a man to use prostitutes.'

'Not that I think that should be criminal but he sure did.'

Political Wire's Taegan Goddard tweeted what many pundits are thinking. Other tweets predicted a Bill Clinton run for Parks and Recreation Director

Politico's Alex Burns offered help to Jay Leno's joke writers, who will soon be competing with the rest of the late-night universe to find new ways to poke fun at New York's political scene

Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer represented George W. Bush for more than two years. His critics would say he knows a thing or two about laughing stocks

Davis' illicit operation, the 
Emperors Club VIP, attracted the attention of federal law enforcement, 
which caught Spitzer on a wiretap arranging a sex-for-pay session in 
Washington, D.C. with a woman whose stage name was Ashley Alexandra Dupré.

'I have acted in a way that violates my 
obligations to my family and violates my - or any - sense of right or 
wrong,' Spitzer finally said in a short speech, after media reports identified him as a man referred to in court documents only as 'Client 9.'

After federal authorities determined that he never used use public money or campaign funds to pay for his romps, Spitzer never faced criminal charges.

But room 871 at the tony Mayflower Hotel in Washington, where he spent 1,000 per hour for his sexcapades, has become a minor tourist attraction.

Spitzer's brethren: Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford (L) won his race for Congress after an affair with his now-fiancee María Belén Chapur. Anthony Weiner (R), posing with a drag queen during New York City's gay pride parade, resigned from Congress after long denying that he tweeted inappropriate photos of himself

The Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. was Eliot Spitzer's preferred home-away-from-home when he enjoyed the company of $1,000-per-hour prostitutes

The 2009 documentary 'Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer' tells the story of the governor's fall from grace, and the corporate titans who were happy to see him self-destruct

The Big Apple's political 
establishment is already reeling from the specter of an Anthony Weiner 
victory in the Democratic mayoral primary, which would make him a heavy 
favorite to claim Gracie Mansion in the fall.

Weiner, far less famous for his time 
in Congress than for tweeting photos of himself in various states of 
undress to young women who were not his newlywed wife, has seized on the
mayoral race as a platform for redemption in a  city known for its 
hard-nosed politics and an anything-goes election philosophy.

Polls show Weiner running close to 
the top of the Democratic pack, jockeying for position with Christine 
Quinn, the Democratic speaker of New York's city council.

Earlier this year, Republican former 
South Carolina governor Mark Sanford made his own 
phoenix-rising-from-the-ashes bid with a surprise win in a congressional
special election, just four years after his extramarital affair seemed 
to tank his political career for good.

Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer dropped out of the mayoral race to run for comptroller instead, but with Eliot Spitzer and his millions now in play, he's no longer a lock to win

Spitzer co-hosted a short-lived CNN show with Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker. Originally called 'Parker Spitzer,' it was renamed 'In The Arena' when Parker left four months after it debuted. The show was canceled after less than nine months on the air

Manhattan Borough President Scott 
Stringer was considered the odds-on favorite to win the controller's 
race before Spitzer entered the fray on Sunday. His campaign came out swinging within an hour of Spitzer's announcement.

'Scott Stringer has a proven record of results and integrity and entered this race to help New York’s middle class regain its footing,' said Stringer campaign manager Sascha Owen. 'By contrast, Eliot Spitzer is going to spurn the campaign finance program to try and buy personal redemption with his family fortune.'

Spitzer is expected to self-finance his bid for comptroller - 'He apparently likes to pay for it,' quipped a series of tweeters on Sunday - using a real estate fortune that includes office buildings along the Mid-Atlantic seaboard from New York to Washington.

Those properties include two Manhattan apartment buildings within blocks of each other on swanky Fifth Avenue: one where Spitzer lived for years with his wife Silda, and another where his father lives.

The New York Post reported in May that the former governor was actually living in the second building, away from his wife.

Presaging an awkward wife-to-wife phone call, New York Post columnist John Podhoretz tweeted his gleeful imagination of a conversation in which the spouses of Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer compare notes

Twitter exploded Sunday evening after Spitzer entered the comptroller race, but former madam Kristin Davis may have the last laugh at the debate

As late-night joke writers and newspaper headline gurus ponder their good fortune, New Yorkers can expect to 
relive the 2008 Spitzer episode, with all its tawdry underpinnings, 
between now and November. That includes the money, the sex, the sensationalized downfall, and even the mid-calf black socks that he 
allegedly declined to take off during his encounters with prostitutes.

But even with the possibility of New York City's top two officeholders sporting the names Weiner and Spitzer, the newer candidate has so far refused to draw any lines of connection between his situation and Anthony Weiner's.

'I don't draw conclusions from anyone else's dynamic or situation,' he told the Daily News. 'The more people get into politics, the healthier it is. I hope the public gives me a fair shot.'
