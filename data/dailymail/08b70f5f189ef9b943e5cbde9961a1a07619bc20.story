David Cameron flew into Algeria tonight to offer extra help in the battle against Al-Qaeda.

The Prime Minister will promise closer security co-operation across west Africa in the wake of the hostage crisis that claimed the lives of six Britons.

Mr Cameron said his aim was to help the country 'help itself' amid a growing threat from terrorists in the region.

Downing Street said that Mr Cameron was 
being accompanied by National Security Adviser Sir Kim Darroch, as well 
as by Lord Risby, his envoy on trade with Algeria.

The visit comes just two weeks after a total of 37 foreign workers died at the remote oil facility - part-operated by 
BP - which was overrun by heavily-armed terrorists on Wednesday January 
16.

Some
29 of the hostage-takers died, while three were captured by Algerian 
troops during a special forces mission to end the four-day stand-off.

Speaking to journalists on the flight to Africa, Mr Cameron said: 'The In Amenas attack and the situation in Mali reminds us of the importance of partnership between Britain and countries in the region.'

Mr Cameron is to hold talks with counterpart Abdelmalek Sellal and pay his respects to victims of the hostage crisis during his visit - the first by a UK Prime Minister to Algeria in 50 years.

Talks are expected to focus on 
strengthening security co-operation between the UK and Algeria, and 
seeing how the two countries can work together to deliver the 'tough, 
patient and intelligent' response to terror outlined by the PM to the 
House of Commons earlier this month.

Upon touching down in Algeria, Cameron paid his respects at the imposing Martyrs Monument overlooking the Bay of Algiers.

After laying a wreath at the 
memorial, originally built to mark the country's war for independence 
from France between 1954 and 1962, he stood with his head bowed for more
than a minute.

Speaking to reporters afterwards, the
Prime Minister said: 'First of all I am here in the wake of that 
terrible terrorist attack in In Amenas in which six British citizens and
one British resident lost their life, a reminder that what happens in 
other countries affects us at home.

'What I want to do is work with the 
Algerian government and with other government in the region to make sure
we do everything we can do to combat terrorism in a way that is both 
tough and intelligent, and uses everything we have at our disposal, 
which will make them safer, make us safer, make the world safer.'

Mr Cameron denied that he was getting into another Iraq or Afghanistan-style campaign.

'We don't look at this region of the world and think that the answer is purely a military one,' he said.

'It is not. What is required in 
countries like Mali, just as countries like Somalia on the other side of
Africa, is that combination of tough approach on security, aid, 
politics, settling grievances and problems.'

Asked to explain to the public why 
the UK should get involved at all, Mr Cameron replied: 'Britain is a 
very open, international, networked country.

'There are British citizens working 
all over the world. Britain's posture in the world therefore should 
reach out, to have partners, to try and ensure the safety of British 
people both back at home in the UK but also around the world too.

Mr Cameron also met staff at the British embassy in Algiers to thank them for their work on the hostage crisis.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond was 
yesterday forced to deny 'mission creep' in the intervention to bolster 
the government in Mali as he boosted the UK's role.

Up
to 240 troops could be deployed to train the Malian military and 
prepare soldiers from other African countries, while another 90 
personnel could provide air support. A roll-on, roll-off ferry has also 
been offered to transport French equipment to Africa.

A
Number 10 spokeswoman described the visit to Algeria as 'part of 
efforts to lead a co-ordinated international response to the evolving 
threat from al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, which is operating from 
parts of the Sahel region'.

She added: 'We want to stand side-by-side with countries in the region working together to overcome the threat.'

Mr Cameron is also expected to discuss 
areas of mutual interest between Britain and Algeria, including trade, 
education, health, culture and energy.

New figures suggest about 450 British workers are thought to be working in Algeria.

Foreign
Office Minister Alistair Burt said the number of British expats working
in the north African country varied' given the transient nature of the 
international workforce in Algeria'.

David Cameron left Downing Street at lunchtime, soon after completing Prime Minister's Questions, to fly to Algeria where he will promise greater security co-operation to take on terrorists in west Africa

Foreign Office advice warns against 'all travel within 100km of the Libyan-Tunisian border south of the Algerian town of Tebassa'.

Mr Burt said further discussions with companies involved in extractive industries working in Algeria would take place this week.

Five British nationals have been named, either by the Foreign Office or their families, after the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria was attacked by Islamist fighters. Three have been confirmed dead and three more are thought to have been killed.

Some 22 Britons escaped the attack, which took place between January 16 and 19.
