American runner Nick Symmonds has become the first international athlete to speak out against Russia's ban on 'gay propaganda', but fears he'll 'get put in jail for it'.

After winning a silver medal in the 800m in Moscow yesterday, the outspoken middle distance runner criticized the controversial law which passed in June.

'As much as I can speak out about it, I believe that all humans deserve equality however God made them,' Symmonds said after the race at Luzhniki stadium.

'Whether you're gay, straight, black, white, we all deserve the same rights. If there's anything I can do to champion the cause and further it I will, shy of getting arrested. I respect Russians' ability to govern their people. I disagree with their laws.'

Brave: American runner Nick Symmonds has denounced Russia's law against 'gay propaganda'

Symmonds' comments could contravene the new law which bans statements maintaining the 'equivalence of traditional and non-traditional sexual relations', according to The Guardian.

The law has 
prompted strong calls among Western activists for a boycott of the 
Winter Olympics, which Russia will host in Sochi early next year.

Foreign citizens who violate the law in the media face a fine of up to 100,000 roubles (US$3000), arrest for up to 15 days and deportation.

Symmonds' statements come after he wrote a blog for Runner's World stating his support for gay rights.

'If I am 
placed in a race with a Russian athlete, I will shake his hand, thank 
him for his country's generous hospitality, and then, after kicking his 
(butt) in the race, silently dedicate the win to my gay and lesbian 
friends back home,' he wrote.

'Upon my return, I will then continue to fight for 
their rights in my beloved democratic union.'

However when questioned by AP about the laws in Moscow yesterday, he said:Â  'I can't talk about it. You're not allowed to talk about it here. I'll get put in jail 
for it.'

The intersection of politics and sports can be awkward, as this year's world championships demonstrates.

The competition is being held at Luzhniki Stadium, the main venue used for the 1980 Moscow Olympics that the U.S. boycotted.

Although the athletes at the worlds won't be competing in Sochi, it's the first major sports event hosted by Russia since the law was passed. It's also seen as an informal test event for the Olympics.

Russia will also host the swimming world championships in 2015 and the World Cup in 2018, so how the law is enforced will likely be a long-standing issue for sports.

Symmonds' concern about jail underlines how the law's vagueness makes it intimidating. The law's definition of 'propaganda' hinges on intent.

Anyone who distributes information with the 'intention' of persuading minors that non-traditional sexual relationships are 'attractive' or 'interesting' could be accused of breaking the law.

Russia has given contradictory signals on how the law will apply to the Olympics. Some said the law would be suspended during the games, but the Interior Ministry has said it would be enforced.

International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said last week that the Russian government provided written reassurances about the law, but that more clarity was needed.

FIFA has also asked for 'clarification and more details'.

During the Olympics, the IOC bans athletes from making political statements.
