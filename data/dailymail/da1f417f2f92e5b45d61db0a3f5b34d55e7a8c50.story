Mat Collins, a Professor in climate systems at Exeter University, said the storms have been driven by the jet stream

One of the Met Office’s most 
senior experts yesterday made a dramatic intervention in the climate 
change debate by insisting there is no link between the storms that have
 battered Britain and global warming.

Mat
 Collins, a Professor in climate systems at Exeter University, said the 
storms have been driven by the jet stream – the high-speed current of 
air that girdles the globe – which has been ‘stuck’ further south than 
usual.

Professor 
Collins told The Mail on Sunday: ‘There is no evidence that global 
warming can cause the jet stream to get stuck in the way it has this 
winter. If this is due to climate change, it is outside our knowledge.’

His
 statement carries particular significance because he is an 
internationally acknowledged expert on climate computer models and 
forecasts, and his university post is jointly funded by the Met Office.

Prof
 Collins is also a senior adviser – a ‘co-ordinating lead author’ – for 
the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). His
 statement appears to contradict Met Office chief scientist Dame Julia 
Slingo.

Last weekend, she said ‘all  the evidence suggests that climate change has a role to  play’ in the storms.

Prof
 Collins made clear that he believes it is likely global warming could 
lead to higher rainfall totals, because a warmer atmosphere can hold 
more water. But he said this has nothing to do with the storm conveyor 
belt.

He said that 
when the IPCC was compiling its Fifth Assessment Report on climate 
change last year, it discussed whether warming might affect the jet 
stream. But, he went on, ‘there was very low confidence that climate 
change has any effect on the jet stream getting stuck’. In the end, the 
possibility was not even mentioned in the report.

Prof Collins declined to comment on his difference of opinion with Dame Julia.

Five
 months ago, in a briefing on the IPCC report to Ministers, Dame Julia 
conceded the consequence of warming for rainfall ‘is not simulated well’
 by climate models – though they are the basis for most of what she and 
other scientists say about the effects of climate change.

Last
 April, after the temperature fell to -11C in Aberdeenshire, the coldest
 April temperature for more than 100 years, Dame Julia said the cold 
winter and spring might also be due to global warming, because of ice 
melting in the Arctic.

Meanwhile, the Met 
Office has continued to issue questionable long-term forecasts. In 
mid-November, two weeks before the first of the storms, it predicted 
persistent high pressure for the winter, which was ‘likely to lead to 
drier-than-normal conditions across the country’.

It
 added that its models showed the probability of the winter being in the
 driest of five official categories was 25 per cent. The chances of it 
being in the wettest category was 15 per cent.

Infamously,
 in April 2009, the Met Office promised a ‘barbecue summer’ – which then
 turned out to be a washout. It forecast the winter of 2010 to 2011 
would be mild: it was the coldest for 120 years.

In
 2007, the Met Office said that globally, the decade 2004-2014 would see
 warming of 0.3C. In fact, the world has not got any warmer at all in 
this period.

At the 
beginning of 13 of the past 14 years, the Met Office has predicted the 
following 12 months would be significantly warmer than they have been. 
This, says the sceptic think-tank the Global Warming Policy Foundation, 
indicates ‘systemic’ bias.
