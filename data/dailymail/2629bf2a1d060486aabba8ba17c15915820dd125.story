The Christmas presents stolen from Great Ormond Street Hospital have been replaced by a 'long-term supporter,' hospital staff confirmed last night.

The 20 gifts, worth £2,000 and bought 
with donations from well-wishers, were destined for patients on the 
intensive respiratory care ward, too ill to go home for Christmas.

The theft was described as a 'disgusting crime beyond belief', and prompted an avalanche of offers of help and last night gifts came pouring in from well-wishers, including the Duchess of York.

London Police are combing 
through CCTV footage to identify the culprit, 
feared to be a  member of staff at the Central London hospital.

The gifts were in a room secured with a key-code lock which the thieves ransacked, even taking the giftbags the presents were to be given to the children in.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said he found it hard to imagine a worse crime.

'It's pretty disgusting really, isn't it? You can't imagine anything worse in a way: children who are very ill and at Christmas,' he told radio station LBC 97.3 yesterday.

'Somebody's taken the time to buy them something to cheer them up and somebody's stolen them. So it's pretty awful.'

Scottish football club Celtic FC also pledged to replace the gifts which included portable DVD players, Nintendo DS games and DVDs. after hearing what happened.

A club spokesperson said the club was 'are only too happy to help where we can in replacing these presents for the children.'

It's really shocking that this has 
happened,' goalkeeper Fraser Forster told The Guardian, adding: 'The club is 
delighted to step in and replace the presents.'

Stunned detectives suspect the gifts may have already been sold for as little as a few hundred pounds to buy drugs.

Detective Chief Inspector Les Newman said he and his colleagues were ‘utterly disgusted’. Mr Newman said some of the intended recipients may not see another Christmas.

‘This is a despicable crime committed by heartless individuals,’ he said.

‘I urge the thief to think about their actions and do the decent thing and return them. I would like to think they had a heart, especially around this time of year.'

‘For some of these kids, it could be their last Christmas. Anyone with kids will feel for this crime and if they have got a suspicion, I suspect they will contact us.

‘There is no honour among thieves and I think we are going to get a phone call telling us who it is.

‘Frankly, I am willing to launch a national manhunt to catch the person responsible. If it means putting their face on lorries and driving them around London, that is what we will do.’

Mr Newman said the crime is the ‘No 1 priority’ for his team, which specialises in thefts.

Police believe the thief was caught on camera but face a substantial task because the presents went missing during a three-day window before the discovery on Monday afternoon.

Well-wishers flooded the hospital with offers of cash and replacement gifts as news of the theft spread. Staff said they had been ‘overwhelmed’ with generous offers, with one adding: ‘There are some bad people out there but there are a lot more good ones.’

One nurse who has worked at the hospital for two years said: ‘It’s despicable. We could hardly believe it when we heard. Even if the thief didn’t realise the presents were for the children, they were clearly Christmas presents.

‘It must either have been someone who didn’t understand the significance of Christmas, or someone who just didn’t care. It’s heartless beyond belief.’

Relatives of patients said the theft was the ‘lowest of the low’.

Jessica Barnard, 29, told how her 
three-year-old daughter Rosie, who suffers from cerebral palsy, spent 
her first Christmas in hospital.

She
 said: ‘The staff really make an effort and the children have pillow 
cases of toys on Christmas morning. It’s so good what they do and to 
think someone could do this, it’s disgusting.’

Pamela
 Clark, 71, added: ‘My granddaughter has been in and out the hospital 
for eight years so she’s spent many Christmases here. To take the 
kiddies’ presents, you can’t get much lower than that.’

A hospital spokesman said: ‘We can confirm there has been a theft and are fully co-operating with the police. We have been overwhelmed by generous offers from individuals and companies to replace the missing items.

‘These items have now been replaced by a long-term supporter. Thank you to everyone who has contacted us for their concern and kindness.’
