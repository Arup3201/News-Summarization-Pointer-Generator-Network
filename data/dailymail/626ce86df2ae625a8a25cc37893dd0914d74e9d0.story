She was vilified for demanding the NHS pay for the breast enlargement operation she needed to become a glamour model.

So Josie Cunningham tried to calm the uproar by saying she would work to pay back the £4,800 cost.

That promise is unlikely to be kept however – after she descended into a life of prostitution and quickly became pregnant.

Fear: Mother-of-two Josie Cunningham, 23, is worried her new baby's father could be one of her clients after revealing she is earning up to £1,000 a night in her new 'great job' as an escort

To
 make matters worse, the 24-year-old does not even know who the father 
is. He is either a surgeon who paid her £1,000 for a night of passion or
 a friend she has casual sex with.

Miss
 Cunningham’s operation in January last year caused outrage, heightened 
further by the same NHS trust refusing to fund surgery that would enable
 a two-year-old girl to walk.

But
 the unmarried mother-of-two says the £1,000 she had so far set aside to
 reimburse the Health Service has now gone on baby clothes.

‘I feel bad, but my baby comes first,’ she told Closer magazine. She added: ‘I’m ashamed to say I don’t know who the father is.

‘I’ve only slept with one client but I’ve also been having casual sex with a friend.’

Refund: Ms Cunningham (pictured) turned to escort work after feeling guilty that her breast enlargement surgery had come at the taxpayers' expense and has vowed to fully refund the NHS using the money she earns

She said she turned to escort work at the suggestion of a friend: ‘I enjoyed sex so it seemed like a good idea.’

She slept with her fourth client, charging £450 for dinner and £1,000 for a night of sex.

‘He’s
 an unmarried surgeon in his mid-30s and I was attracted to him straight
 away,’ she said. ‘We had sex on the third date. I was paid £1,000 – it 
felt amazing.’

She continued seeing two clients a week until she discovered she was pregnant.She is due in six months.

‘I
 couldn’t stop crying,’ she said. ‘I worked out the client could be the 
father or a friend I have casual sex with. I called the client straight 
away. He was shocked and begged me to keep it quiet.’

Because
 she can no longer work as an escort, she has found alternative 
employment in the sex trade – working on adult phone lines.

Miss
 Cunningham said she didn’t use protection with her friend as they had 
been drinking and were ‘caught up in the moment’. She plans to carry out
 a DNA test to discover who the father is.

Before: Prior to having her NHS boob job, Josie claimed that she felt unwomanly because of her small breasts

‘Both men have said they’ll support me financially and want access to the baby.’

Miss
 Cunningham successfully applied for funding and underwent cosmetic 
surgery to increase her bust from 32A to a 36DD at St James’s Hospital 
in Leeds.

More recently the 
hospital’s trust has refused to fund surgery on Sophie Thomlinson, a 
two-year-old with a form of cerebral palsy which means she cannot use 
her legs.

An operation on 
her spinal cord would enable her to take her first steps, but health 
chiefs decided the £25,000 procedure was too expensive.

Generous
 Daily Mail readers last week donated thousands of pounds to a fund to 
pay for the girl’s treatment privately. MailOnline readers said last 
night they were horrified by Miss Cunningham’s pregnancy revelations.

One said: ‘She will be on Jeremy Kyle when the baby is born to find out who is the daddy. This woman is a disaster zone.’

Another commented: ‘It’s scary to see where the NHS puts its priorities.’

Miss Cunningham, from Leeds, has a congenital medical condition which means she has no breast tissue.

She says she was bullied about her flat chest from the age of 14.

Recently she decided she wants her breast implants removed – again paid for by the NHS.
