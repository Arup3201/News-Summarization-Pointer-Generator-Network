Rising numbers of ‘massive’ babies born by caesarean section are driving Britain’s obesity epidemic, by allowing infants to thrive that would never have survived in the past, according to a controversial expert.

Natural selection is being written out of the equation by the operation, claims Dr Edward Archer. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘When a mother is inactive and obese, their baby grows massive. The baby can’t get through the birth canal, and the doctor has to perform a C-section.

‘That allows both the mother and foetus to survive, when previously they would have died.’

His comments follow an article in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings by Dr Archer, suggesting obesity is not just a matter of genetics, or eating too much and exercising too little. Rather, it is hard-wired into the children of fat mothers while they are still in the womb.

With girls of C-section mothers more likely to have caesareans themselves, the effect has snowballed over the generations, he said. ‘The evolutionary consequence is we are getting much bigger children than ever in the history of mankind.’

Caesareans account for more than one in four UK births – up from nine per cent in 1980 – with the figure continue to climb, leading to ‘sky-rocketing’ numbers of extremely obese people, Dr Archer, of the University of Alabama in the US said. Dr Daghni Rajasingam, spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, agreed women who had a higher body mass index were more likely to have caesareans.

And babies born by caesarean did have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and obesity in later life, she noted. But while there was a ‘complex association’ between the two, that did not necessarily mean cause and effect existed.

And she stressed: ‘I don’t know of any obstetric data that relate being inactive in pregnancy directly to growing a big baby. Very small women who are very active can also have very big babies.’

She also emphasised that caesareans were carried out for a variety of reasons, and not just to deliver big babies.
