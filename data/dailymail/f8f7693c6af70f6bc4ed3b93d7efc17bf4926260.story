The home of a top British diplomat was at the centre of a huge counter-terrorism search last night over fears it is being used to hide chemical weapons.

Dozens of officers, including specialists in chemical and biological threats, were tearing apart the £650,000 property after a tip-off.

The house belongs to Nicholas Sutcliffe, a first secretary to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office who has served in Brazil and Cuba.

Searches: Investigators in protective equipment sift through material at the Streatham house tonight

Operation: Police stand guard outside the address in Stratford, where searches are also taking place

It is not known if the senior public 
servant, who shares the property with his wife Carole and four sons, was
 at home when the police raid began.

A
 19-year-old man, believed to be one of his twin sons, was arrested 
under counter terrorism laws and has since been released on bail.

In
 a second linked operation, a 36-year-old woman was arrested at her home
 in Stratford, East London, under the same legislation. She remained in 
custody last night.

Neighbours
 described a ‘motorcade’ descending on their street in Streatham Hill, 
South London as more than 30 officers in a dozen vans, including a 
satellite communications truck, surrounded the property and sealed the 
road.

Specialist officers 
were seen entering the four-bedroom semi-detached home wearing 
protective clothing and carrying breathing equipment.

Within
 hours they could be seen digging up the back garden as colleagues 
searched the home. The search was then expanded to the garden of the 
neighbouring property, which is owned by an unconnected family.

Forensic tents were erected over the excavations and arc lights erected so they could continue working through the night.

Arrests: Police stand guard outside the Streatham property earlier today

Search: Officers have set up tents in houses surrounding the Streatham address

Scotland
 Yard described the raid as an ‘intelligence-led, pre-planned operation’
 and it is not believed to be linked to an active terrorist plot.

A spokesman said residents were not at ‘immediate risk’, adding that   the protective clothing was a precautionary measure.

The
 teenager was arrested under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act,
 drawn up after 9/11. A key element allows the Home Secretary to 
indefinitely detain, without charge or trial, foreign nationals 
suspected of terrorism.

It also covers aiding or abetting the overseas use or development of chemical or biological weapons.

Mr
 Sutcliffe is described in the Diplomatic Service List as a ‘First 
Secretary’ to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office since 2001.

He
 was posted to Brazil as an economic expert, in 1990, and Havana, Cuba, 
in 1998. His sons attended Graveney School in South London.

Mr
 Sutcliffe’s sister-in-law Jenny, from Chelmsford, said: ‘I don’t know 
anything about it. It’s just lunacy. It just sounds so strange. We’re 
talking about a normal, middle-class family here. It must be a mix-up.’

Searches: Officers approach the Streatham address, where police confirmed searches were continuing

Planned operation: The arrests were made over the weekend

Officers: Police could be seen around the address in Streatham, south London, where on arrest took place

His
 brother Peter Sutcliffe, 49, of Huddersfield, a magazine editor, said: 
‘James and George are my nephews and they are 19-year-old twins. I find 
it extraordinary police have made an arrest and I cannot believe either 
James or George have involvement in terrorism.’

Neighbour
 Serena Agnello, 22, said: ‘The police have come in to use my loo a few 
times and one told me they found something. They said they’re going to 
be here for the rest of the week.’

Others
 described the Sutcliffes as a ‘quiet family’ and said they were 
‘stunned’ by the police operation which was ‘taking the house apart 
piece by piece’.

One wrote 
on Twitter: ‘Scary, gas masks on and they won’t tell us anything!’ 
Neighbour Peter Petchey, 60, said: ‘They seemed like a very nice family 
and they must have lived there for at least 12 years.’

The raid took place at 8am on Saturday. The Stratford operation was mounted at 4pm on Sunday.

Local MP Chuka Umunna said police had told him there was no danger to other residents.
