Randy Brits have said holiday spirits and the thrill of not knowing if they'd get caught are the main reasons for having sex in airports.

Instead of doing crosswords, reading or simply catching up on sleep whilst waiting for a flight, nine per cent of UK travellers are getting down and dirty in airports loos and storage rooms.

The surprising results from a new poll conducted by flight comparison website Jetcost.co.uk revealed the growing trend of sexual encounters in terminals, suggesting the Airport Club is becoming as much of a phenomenon as the Mile-High Club.

Naughty behaviour: A new survey has found that Brit travellers are getting up to no good in airport loos

76% choose to have sex in airport toilets whilst 21% decided to take the risk in storage areas or rooms

Three quarters (76 per cent) choose to have sex in airport toilets while 21 per cent decided to take the risk in storage areas or rooms. 

Twelve per cent people who had had a sexual encounter at the airport admitted they had been caught by either staff or members of the public.

When asked why they had sex at the airport, 32 per cent said they were 'in the holiday spirit' and 27 per cent admitted they wanted the 'thrill' of not knowing if they would get caught.

All respondents were also asked if they had ever had a sexual encounter on an aircraft, to which only four per cent admitted to it. Thirty-one per cent of these had been caught in the act.

 Forget checking emails when waiting for a flight, 9% choose to have airport sex instead

More than 2,520 respondents from across the UK were quizzed about their airport experiences. 

To determine whether this was purely a UK trend or something that was becoming popular in all Europe, 1,000 people from European countries were also polled.

The results showed that Italians (17 per cent) are the most amorous when it comes to sexual encounters in airports, followed by the Spanish (14 per cent). Eight per cent from Germany gave in to their desires whilst only three percent of the French did the same. 

Passing time: Sitting around waiting and playing games were some of the other things Brit travellers did

The poll also found that 79 per cent of Brit travellers spent their time eating and drinking and half (52 per cent) decided to while away the hours by reading.

Browsing duty free shops (30 per cent), sitting around waiting (24 per cent) and playing games (19 per cent) were some of the other things Brit holidaymakers did to pass time.

The poll was conducted by flight comparison website Jetcost.co.uk and 2,521 UK respondents aged 18 and over were quizzed about their airport experiences.

Antoine Michelat, co-founder of Jetcost.co.uk, said: 'These results shocked us a little. We're surprised that more people haven't been caught in the act.

'Clearly, intimate acts in airports are even more common than those that take place on planes! I suppose one of the reasons many people are tempted is the thrill of knowing you're not supposed to be doing what you're doing, where you're doing it.'
