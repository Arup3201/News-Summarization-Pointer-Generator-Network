An Upstate New York music festival meant, in part, as a nod to the 1969's Woodstock, was canceled Sunday due to torrential rains sweeping through the area.

The Hudson Project was meant to last from July 11 to July 13, but Sunday evening's acts including Bassnectar were rained out.

The music was supposed to go on at least through the early morning hours Monday, but rains turned the Saugerties campground into a muddy scene more reminiscent of the summer of 1994's famously sloppy Woodstock followup than the summer of love.

The Daily Freeman reports that promoters MCP Presents made the call to suspend the show at around 4:45pm.

'Based on the recommendation from Ulster County and information from the National Weather Service concerning approaching storms, in conjunction with the previous afternoon inclement weather, we have decided to cancel this eveningâ€™s performances,' MCP posted on the festival website.

Nonetheless, photos from the festival on Sunday show revelers getting down and dirty and making the most of the filthy festivities.

Mud-covered hills became the perfect 
sledding slopes men and women slipped and slid their way to a good time 
even without a musical accompaniment.

One shot showed two men, one of them proudly holding aloft a liquor bottle, as they careened down a muddy hill in a children's wagon.

Promoters were sure to note that, while the show was canceled, the more intoxicated among the concert goers were welcome to stay in their cars to sleep off the booze and wait out the storm.

'You do not need to leave if you are not sober, we are not asking anyone to drive drunk. If you are unable to leave the venue for any reason, please stay in your vehicles until the storm passes or you can depart safely,' reads the announcement.

Initially the evening's acts were only suspended, but as the day wore on it appears the threat of storms was enough to cancel the rest of the festivities altogether.

Risky? While some of the muddy games looked harmless, some of the revelers may have been taking more risks than others
