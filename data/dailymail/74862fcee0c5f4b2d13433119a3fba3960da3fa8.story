Kobe Bryant will have surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder, the Los Angeles Lakers said on Monday.

The five-time National Basketball Association champion will have surgery on Wednesday and a timeline for his return will be issued following the procedure, the team said in a statement.

Bryant injured his shoulder last week and it could lead to the 16-time NBA All-Star being shut down for the rest of the 2014-15 season.

Bryant sustained the injury during the second half of a 96-80 loss at the New Orleans Pelicans. 

Sources told ESPN that he had been dealing with this problem since pre-season.

The two-time NBA scoring champion had made light of the injury Friday on social media.

'This is what happens when I pass too much!' he tweeted.

The 36-year-old guard was averaging 22.3 points from 35 games this season for a struggling Lakers team that is last in the Pacific Division with a 12-33 record. 

Bryant currently has another 12 months to run on a two-year contract extension he signed with the Western Conference franchise back in 2013, worth £32million.
