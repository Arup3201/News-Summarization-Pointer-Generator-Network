Secret police surveillance of the family of Stephen Lawrence has proved our democracy is ‘unaccountable’, a leading barrister has said.

Michael Mansfield QC said police spying was ‘out of control’ and warned that other families may also have been targeted by undercover officers.

The lawyer, who has supported Doreen Lawrence in her fight for justice, spoke out during a Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust lecture on undercover policing sponsored by the Daily Mail.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that Doreen and her husband Neville were spied on by Scotland Yard in the aftermath of their son’s death.

Mr Mansfield said last night: ‘It’s out of control. The fact that it has happened for such a long time is just a manifestation of the extraordinarily unaccountable nature of our so-called democracy.’

The spying, uncovered in a report by Mark Ellison QC, went on during the Macpherson Inquiry into Stephen’s death.

Mr Mansfield added: ‘This is another example of how the British state have managed its affairs when they’re so quick to criticise everyone else.'

Under fire: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told MPs yesterday he would immediately look into claims failed to act on death threats made against Doreen Lawrence

He said: ‘Without Doreen’s stamina and persistence alongside the fourth estate and along the big estate - that’s you - your support throughout has meant everything to her.

The lecture, titled ‘Undercover Police and the Secret State’, was held at the TUC Congress House in Central London.

Other speakers included Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary and TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady.
