Property experts claim that the housing market could be up to 10% over valued, following a month of staggering results for the national property market.

In Melbourne a record breaking 1558 properties were up for grabs this weekend alone, with one of the top selling properties fetching an astounding $5.35 million.

The Hawthorn property, which was last bought as a block for $950,000 in 1998, sold prior to auction and boasted six bedrooms on three levels, and included a lap pool and tennis court.

With four bathrooms, a butlers pantry, a separate guest wing and court-side terraces, the house is nestled in an exclusive suburb close to top end private schools and boutique shopping.

The property had been expected to sell for as little as $5 million, and so the selling price reflects a growing trend of increased sale prices throughout Australia.

Experts from Deloitte Access Economics report that the Reserve Bank of Australia should be nervous about Australian housing prices 'getting too far ahead of themselves.'

The latest Business Outlook report indicates that 'on simple measures, housing looks to be about 10 per cent overvalued'.  

Warwick Anderson, Director of RT Edgar Toorak, said that this was particularly evident in houses within the $1-$2 million range, as there was increased competition for the properties. 

This Toorak property sold for $1.73 million at auction over the weekend, $400,000 over reserve price

The house was 'renovated beautifully', according to Warwick Anderson, Director of RT Edgar Toorak

'The trend of houses selling for well over reserve price is much more common in this range, where younger couples are bidding against older couples who may be downsizing,' he said.

'Particularly if they're well renovated, they're the ones that are really taking off.'

'One property sold over the weekend for $1.73 million, $400,000 over the reserve price. In that price range that is extraordinary.'  

The Denham Place, Toorak property was placed on the market for $2.665 million, but sold for $2.770 million when it went under the hammer over the weekend.

The property had been 'beautifully renovated,' according to Anderson, and had the potential for further restoration.

However, Anderson said the trend tapered off the higher the price brackets went, where the turnover of properties had increased but the prices remained relatively stable.

'It's an interesting market, but it's important not to overstate the sale prices in that range, which do pale off.'

'There simply aren't as many properties in what we called the hyper top end. It's the properties in the lower bracket of $1-$2 million that are seeing the growth in sales especially.'

This reinforces the report from Deloitte Access Economics which indicated that despite early concerns that Victoria's economy was under pressure, interest and exchange rates remain solid.

In NSW, Deloitte said that interest rates remained low, and the housing market was 'hot, with a big lift in homebuilding underway helping to underpin a broadly favourable growth outlook.'

'It's NSW time to shine,' said the report.

This is clear from the impressive silver medal price at auction over the weekend, which saw a property in Sydney's CBD fetch $3,880,000.

The Deloitte report indicated that Australia's banks are 'taking advantage of cheap global funding to cut fixed term mortgage rates,'

'Along with concern over housing prices, that says the RBA won’t cut the cash rate below its current lows.'

The remainder of the top five selling properties over the weekend also showed impressive sale results.
