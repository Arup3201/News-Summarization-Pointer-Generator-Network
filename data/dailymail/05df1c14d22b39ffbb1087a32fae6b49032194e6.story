Labour's chief election strategist repeatedly refused to rule out a coalition with the Scottish Nationalists yesterday.

Douglas Alexander dodged questions over whether Labour would enter a power-sharing deal with Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond if it fails to win a majority in May.

There are increasing signs of a split at the top of the Labour Party over the issue of a deal with the SNP, currently on course to win dozens of Labour seats in Scotland.

Ed Miliband has been reluctant to rule out a power-sharing arrangement, but shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has suggested he wants to rule one out.

Former Scottish First Minister Mr Salmond, who is standing in the general election, said Mr Miliband had managed the ‘remarkable achievement’ of becoming ‘even more unpopular than David Cameron’ in Scotland, a traditional Labour heartland.

There has been speculation that Mr Salmond could take a ministerial post in a Labour-SNP coalition – even that of deputy prime minister.

He said a formal deal was unlikely but ‘possible’, leaving the door open to SNP MPs propping up a government led by Mr Miliband in exchange for costly concessions.

Asked to rule out a Labour-SNP coalition, Mr Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary and head of Labour’s election campaign, said he was ‘not going to play that game”.

He conceded the ‘polls are tough’ for Labour but insisted the party was fighting for a majority, telling the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘The fact is after the referendum there were a very significant constituency in Scotland who want change. I share that appetite for change.

‘In the coming election in May the way that we can secure that change is not to split the centre left vote but to deliver the maximum number of Labour MPs and, thereby, make sure we have a progressive government not a government led by David Cameron or a government of David Cameron and Nigel Farage.’

Mr Alexander suggested Labour would not be prepared to agree to move Trident nuclear weapons from Scotland as part of any negotiations with the SNP after the May 7 election.

Shadow Chancellor Mr Balls took a different stance when asked last week if his party could do a deal with the nationalists. 

He said: ‘No. And I don’t think anybody is suggesting any suggestion of a deal with the SNP at all.’ 

Asked how the SNP would exploit a hung parliament yesterday, Mr Salmond told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme: ‘The best way to effect change is to negotiate on a vote-by-vote basis. A balanced parliament looks pretty likely at the present moment.’

He said his priority would be to ‘enforce’ the vow made by the main Westminster party leaders during the referendum campaign of devo max for Scotland.

The SNP also wanted the cancellation of the Trident nuclear deterrent ‘instead of another bout of austerity from Labour or Conservative’, he said.

‘Diverting that funding, £30billion over the next ten years, into health and education and something useful and productive...I think that will have a lot of support in England as well as in Scotland,’ he added. 

Jim Murphy, the leader of the Scottish Labour Party, said his party ‘does not want’ a coalition with the SNP. But his deputy Kezia Dugdale has said she would have ‘no qualms whatsoever’.

Prime Minister David Cameron said the prospect of a Labour administration being ‘held hostage’ by the SNP was ‘genuinely frightening’.

Lucy Powell, the vice chairman of Labour’s election campaign, dismissed claims that Labour MPs had also been talking to Sinn Fein about some sort of accommodation after the election as ‘absolute nonsense’. 

Last week the Tories used a campaign poster featuring Mr Miliband with Gerry Adams after reports that the party was seeking partners to prop it up in a hung parliament.

The Tories put out an election poster last week claiming Ed Miliband could be propped up in Number 10 by the SNP and Sinn Fein. It came after reports the party was seeking partners to prop it up in a hung parliament
