A monkey was mauled by a bear after a disturbing circus stunt went wrong.

A video has emerged online of two monkeys and a black bear being forced to ride bicycles around a track in front of a large crowd.

After two laps of the track, one of the monkeys crash and the bear then attacks it as it lies stuck under the bicycle.

Crowds can be heard cheering and laughing as the animals ride around the small arena

The gruesome video is believed to have been shot at the Shanghai Wild Animal Park, in China, which has hit the headlines in the past for its 'Wild Animal Olympics'.

In the video, the audience can be heard cheering and laughing as the animals are sent riding around the small arena.

Circus workers holding sticks push the small bikes off but after a few seconds one monkey and the bear crash.

Staff can be seen desperately trying to force the bear off as it grabs the small monkey in its mouth.

At one stage three workers, dressed in brightly coloured costumes, try to wrestle the bear away, while another leads the second monkey away.

Campaign group Animals Asia said it has previously documented cheetahs, lions, tigers, bears, chimpanzees and an elephant being forced to perform in the 'Wild Animal Olympics'.

It is not clear when the latest video was taken but Shanghai Wild Animal Park said in 2006 that the Olympic event had been scrapped following complaints and 'out of consideration for the safety of our visitors.'

Stunts in the show had included making bears box one another and ride bicycles, kangaroos boxing humans and monkeys lifting weights.

Visitors to the park can also pay to have their picture taken with the big cats and other animals.

Animals Asia said some of the creatures had also been declawed.

China Tour Online's website said the park 'offers animal performances, showing the charm and skill of the animals and their gift in performing.'
