The clash of the leading full backs is an intriguing sub-plot to Saturday's elimination play-off between Leeds and Catalan Dragons at Headingley.

In the 2014 Super League Dream Team, Leeds No 1 Zak Hardaker got the vote ahead of the Dragons’ French international Morgan Escare.

Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous said: ‘It was disappointing for Escare not to be in the Dream Team. I know Zak is a fantastic player, but scoring 27 tries in 27 games is pretty good.’

Hardaker said: ‘It might not seem a big thing to everyone but for me it’s massive.’

The Leeds full back was also told this week that the investigation into his alleged homophobic comment was being dropped.
