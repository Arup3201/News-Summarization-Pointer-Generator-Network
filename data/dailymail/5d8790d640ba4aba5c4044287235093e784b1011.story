A blast of freezing rain will scatter snow and ice across the Deep South today, prompting officials from New Orleans to Virginia to ready road crews and close schools in what has been called a 'once in a generation' ice storm.

And as the winter storm system brings freezing snow and high winds to the South, the brutal cold 
temperatures will continue to rattle the Midwest throughout Tuesday.

Chicago, Minneapolis, Milwaukee and 
other parts of the Midwest will endure a second 
consecutive day of subzero highs, while much of the Northeast
 will see temperatures in the single digits and teens, Accuweather.com reported.

Popular warm-weather tourist destinations in the South including Charleston in South Carolina, Savannah in Georgia and Pensacola in Florida are expecting ice and even snow - rare occurrences in places that seldom see prolonged sub-freezing temperatures.

Atlanta and Charleston could see temperatures drop to 16F (-9C), while the mercury could plunge to 24F (-4C) in Pensacola. Embarrass, Minnesota will hold the day's coldest temperature of -34F (-36C).

The Weather Channel warned that the heavy accumulation of ice around Savannah and Charleston could spark long power outages and falling trees, blocking off roads and causing travel havoc.

As temperatures continue to drop, more than 3,200 flights have been canceled across the country, according to FlightStats, and Amtrak has reduced some services. Schools, universities and government buildings across the Midwest and South will stay closed today.

Sun is forecasted for the Super Bowl kickoff this Sunday - but it will still be the coldest on record.

The Weather Channel predicts a high of 37F (3C) and a low of 24 F (-4C) on Sunday with sun, a low chance of showers and slow winds in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home to the MetLife Stadium.

While this is far kinder than commentators, fans and meteorologists have predicted in the weeks leading up to Sunday's game, it will still take the crown for the coldest ever Super Bowl.

The current record is 39 degrees, which was set in 1972 in New Orleans.

Winter storm alerts have 
been issued by the National Weather Service stretching from central 
Texas through the Gulf Coast into Georgia, the Carolinas and 
far southeast Virginia.

Eastern and central Texas will endure the biggest snow threat in the South, while east North Carolina and southeast 
Virginia could get more than six inches 
of snow, The Weather Channel reported.

Weather
 Channel meteorologist Nick Wiltgen 
described it as a 'potentially paralyzing winter storm', while winter 
weather expert, Tom Niziol, said the South could expect weather 'that 
many parts have not seen in years' - perhaps the 
biggest ice storm in a generation, NBC reported.

Schools from the Lone Star State to Florida will be closed on Tuesday, while more than 400 flights 
at Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport and more than 300 at 
George Bush Intercontinental Airport have already been canceled for the day, NBC reported.

 below zero across the Great Lakes.

Amtrak has also canceled a number of train routes in and out of Chicago on Tuesday because of the frigid weather conditions.

The temperatures are also causing ice to 
accumulate on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers, slowing the movement 
of grain barges to the U.S. Gulf, according to Drew Lerner, a 
meteorologist at World Weather Inc.

National Weather Service meteorologist 
Andrew Krein blamed the weather on a surge of arctic high pressure out 
of Canada that has spread over the upper Midwest and central plains.

Even weather-hardy Midwesterners expressed weariness on Monday with the sub-zero cold snap, the second this month.
