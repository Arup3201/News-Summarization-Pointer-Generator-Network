After Harry Redknapp spent the week revealing a series of nostalgic dream teams, Gary Lineker has got in on the act by naming an England XI featuring the best players he has shared a pitch with.

The BBC presenter, who scored 48 goals in 80 appearance for his country, posted his team on Twitter where he opted for a front line of former Newcastle legends Alan Shearer and Peter Beardsley.

In a team that is likely to have Roy Hodgson drooling, Lineker's midfield offers the pace of Chris Waddle and John Barnes on the wings with Bryan Robson anchoring the centre while Paul Gascoigne provides the creative spark.

At the back of Lineker's 4-4-2 formation is Peter Shilton in goal, Stuart Pearce and Viv Anderson as full-backs and a central defensive partnership of Des Walker and Terry Butcher.

Nine of the players - excluding Shearer and Anderson - were part of the Three Lions squad that reached the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup under Bobby Robson.

Compared to England's so-called Golden Generation and the current crop of under performers, Lineker's throwback XI will have some supporters wishing for a time machine.
