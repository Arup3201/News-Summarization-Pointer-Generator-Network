Photos of a supposed iPhone 6 dummy mould, pictured, appear to show the casing as larger and thinner than the current flagship iPhone 5S

Front panels of the rumoured iPhone 6 leaked online earlier this month, so it was only a matter of time before the back panel made an appearance.

Photos of the supposed dummy moulds appear to show Apple's next device with a larger and thinner case than the current flagship iPhone 5S.

They don’t hint at anything that hasn’t been seen in previous leaks, but they do add to a catalogue of evidence suggesting Apple is heading into Samsung’s territory with its new design.

It is unclear where the moulds have come from - and they may not even relate to an upcoming Apple handset - but the position of the volume buttons and camera seem to mirror current models.

None of the photos feature dimension information.

Nowhereelse.fr said: ‘With its curved edges to frame these two buttons for adjusting the volume size, and the elongated protruding optical picture accompanied by a circular LED flash, this model shows that overall aesthetic lines and features recently revealed by multiple technical plans seems to turn confirm the design of the iPhone 6.’

Pictures claiming to be the front panel of Apple's upcoming device were leaked on Chinese site Weibo earlier this month.

It similarly revealed what appeared to be the much-rumoured 4.7-inch screen, but reports also claim Apple is working on a 5.5-inch version and the rear casing may be either.

Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version.

Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm.

This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm.

By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm.

Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick, while the HTC One is 9.3mm.

However, more recent models from Samsung and HTC were thicker than their predecessors.

The Galaxy S5 is 8.1mm and the HTC One M8 is 9.4mm.

According to iphone.fr, which first spotted the images, the dimensions of the screen lend credibility to the image.

'It features what may be (or not) an "iPhone 6" front face.

'By comparison with the iPhone 5, we estimate the height for the screen at 4.1 inches (10.7 cm) and a width around 2.35 inches (6 cm).

'This gives a ratio of width and height at 0.55, which is exactly the one found on the current iPhone 5 and a 4.7 diagonal length.'

The rumours come amid claims Apple suppliers around the world are gearing up to produce the larger screens.

Japan Display, Sharp, and South Korea's 
LG Display have all been tapped to make the panels, and its thought they
 will begin mass production ‘within weeks.’

If the rumours are true, both iPhone 6 screens will be larger than the current 4-inch panels on Apple's iPhone 5S and 5C models.

Other leaked images, pictured left and right, were posted on Chinese social network Weibo in March and are thought to have been posted by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier Foxconn. Although the images are blurry, they appear to show a rounded design and protruding camera, similar to that seen on the iPod touch

Larger iPhones, the subject of months of speculation, would mark yet another incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch up to rivals like Samsung and HTC.

CEO Tim Cook, while promising only 'new product categories' for 2014, has played his cards close to his chest.

Both iPhone 6 screens are expected to use in-cell touch panel technology - built into the screen and allowing for thinner construction than with standard touch panel films - that was introduced with the iPhone 5, sources said.

A patent published last week suggested the iPhone 6 may have a holographic display.

The files detail a display that appears to float 3D images, or holograms, above it, and these holograms can then be moved using finger gestures.

This process involves a system that creates the 3D image, an optical system that puts this image into the air, and a touch sensor.

According to the application, the hologram is created using infrared lasers - or similar devices - that project the image onto a surface above the display.

This projection would then appear via the optical system, which could be situated between two parabolic or concave mirrors that have reflective surfaces facing each other.

Money saving website Vouchercodespro.co.uk asked their patent and trademark insider to help them devise what the holographic iPhone may look like.

The images, pictured above and below, show how the Apple menu and alarm could work using this holographic system.
