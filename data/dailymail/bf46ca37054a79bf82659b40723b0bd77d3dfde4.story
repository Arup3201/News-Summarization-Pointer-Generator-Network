It's one of those everyday irritations that most people are too polite to do anything about.

So imagine the relief of the passengers on one train journey when someone else told off a woman for having a rather loud mobile phone conversation.

To the added glee of commuters, their hero was the train driver.

The train was travelling from London Euston (file picture) to Milton Keynes when the announcement was made to the delight of passengers

Mid-way through the journey from London Euston to Milton Keynes, the driver announced on the tannoy: ‘This is a special message to the lady travelling in first class in the middle of the train.

'Please refrain from shouting on the phone as you are annoying other passengers.’

The embarrassed passenger promptly ended her phone call, much to the delight of fellow commuters.

Peter Foot, chairman of the National Campaign for Courtesy, described the announcement as ‘marvellous’, pointing out that a passenger might have complained first.

Mr Foot said: ‘It’s big bugbear, people having loud mobile phone conversations on trains.

The train was mid-way through the journey when the driver made the announcement on the tannoy. Many services now have 'quiet carriages' which ban mobile use (file picture)

‘I have never heard of an announcement like this being made on a train before. I think it’s an excellent idea.’

A spokesman for train operator London Midland said such announcements were not part of any company policy.
