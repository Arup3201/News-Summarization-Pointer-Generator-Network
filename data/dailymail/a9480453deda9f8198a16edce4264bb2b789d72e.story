A cleaner who prompted the resignation of a minister when it emerged she was working in the UK illegally was arrested yesterday as she attended her daughter’s wedding.

Columbian Isabella Acevedo was detained by Border Force officials yesterday afternoon at Haringey town hall in north London just moments before the ceremony was about to start, according to witnesses.

Isabella Acevedo worked for former immigration minister Mark Harper who resigned after learning she didn't have leave to remain in the UK

Miss Acevedo, 47, had worked as Tory immigration minister Mark Harper’s cleaner for seven years until February, when he discovered she did not have leave to remain in the UK.

Mr Harper was responsible for the controversial van adverts telling immigrants to ‘go home’ and was also overseeing a bill that requires employers to check the status of their staff.

He
 resigned in February but was reappointed to the government in this 
week’s reshuffle as a junior minister at the Department for Work and 
Pensions.

It
 is not clear why Acevedo was still in the country, but a witness at the
 wedding claims 15 immigration officers burst in whilst she was waiting 
for her daughter to enter the hall.

Trenton
 Oldfield, a family friend who was present – and who successfully 
resisted deportation to Australia after being arrested for jumping into 
the Thames to disrupt the 2012 boat race – told the Guardian: ‘[The 
officers] swept into the room when we were just about to start the 
ceremony.

‘We don’t know where they came from. They must have been waiting in the building.’

Mr Oldfield said Acevedo was ‘very quickly’ taken away, along with her brother.

Police told the bride and groom that the ceremony could not go ahead because of an alleged discrepancy in their paperwork.

However,
 their papers were found to be in order and the ceremony was able to 
proceed, though without the mother-of-the-bride present.

Miss Acevedo had been paid £30 a week by Harper for four hours of cleaning and ironing at his Westminster flat.

He claimed most of this back from his parliamentary expenses - more than £2,000 over the seven years she worked for him.

In his resignation letter to David Cameron, Harper said he had checked Miss Acevedo’s status when he hired her in 2007.

He
 said it was only when he asked the Home Office to confirm her legal 
status that he discovered she did not, as he had thought, have 
indefinite leave to remain.
