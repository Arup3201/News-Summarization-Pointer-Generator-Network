An 18-year-old man has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in brutally beating to death a disabled Chicago man.

Nicholas Ayala, 18, who allegedly laughed while committing the crime, pleaded guilty to murder and robbery in the 2012 killing of 62-year-old Delfino Mora during the vicious street game. The brutal crime was captured on video and then posted on Facebook.

Ayala, Anthony Malcolm, 20, and Malik Jones, 18, were each charged with first-degree murder and robbery Mora’s slaying.

Last year, Anthony Malcolm was found guilty of first-degree murder and 
robbery for his part in the sickening attack. He is currently serving 30 years in jail.

According to prosecutors, Ayala was with two other teenagers in July of 2012 when they decided to play a game called 'Pick 'em out, knock 'em out'.

The three targeted Mr Mora, a father of 12 and grandfather of 23, in an alley in the West Rogers Park neighbourhood and ordered him to empty his pockets.

Ayala's friend Malik Jones allegedly then punched him in the jaw, causing him to fall to the ground and hit his head on the concrete.

The group then proceeded to rifle through the victim's wallet as he lay dying in the alley.

Victim: Mr Mora, who was disabled, was found unconscious in an alley in 
Chicago in July 2012. He died in hospital the next day as a result of blunt
 head trauma

Murdered: Mr Mora was found by a passer-by with blood on his face and vomit next to his head

Mr Mora was found by a passer-by with
 blood on his face and vomit next to his head about three hours later 
and was taken to hospital.

However, he died the next day as a result of blunt head trauma.

A cellphone was used to record the fatal assault on Mr Mora, who didn't have full use of his right arm after a workplace accident 15 years ago.

He then posted the sickening footage on to Facebook.

'He left him in the alley like a piece of garbage,' said prosecutor James Murphy at an earlier hearing. 'To them it was funny, they laughed.'

 Judge Joseph Claps ruled in that the three teens were 'accountable' for the death of Mr Mora.

'It’s a sad travesty that Mr. Delfino 
Mora died because of the actions of people who apparently think that 
what they were doing was a game,' he said. 'Well, it wasn’t a 
game for Mr. Mora and his family.'

The one-minute recording of the attack, which was posted on to Facebook, was the most damning piece of evidence presented during the case.

Laughter from the three teens charged in the brutal death could be heard on the tape.

Going to jail: The second of three men charged in the "Pick 'Em Out and Knock 'Em Out" slaying of a 62-year-old father of 12 has been sentenced to 27 years in prison after pleading guilty

Chilling: Malcolm recorded the brutal attack on a cellphone, before posting it on Facebook. One other friend is now awaiting trial

Mr Mora, who had been collecting soda 
cans when he was approached by the youths, had emigrated to Chicago in 
the 1980s from Michoacán, Mexico.

He
 supplemented his disability payments by collecting the waste cans early
 in the morning and was attacked just blocks from his home.

He was a father to six girls and six boys, who range in age from 17 to 40, and was also a grandfather.

Speaking in July after the first teen was convicted, Mr Mora's son Emanuel said: 'We
 feel a little bit of peace in our hearts. The judge made the right decision. But on the other
 side, we still feel a little bit down because with this decision, it’s 
not going to bring our father back.'
