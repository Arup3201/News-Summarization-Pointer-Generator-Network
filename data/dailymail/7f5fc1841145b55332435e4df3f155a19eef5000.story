Kelly Ecker, who was shot dead by her husband Dr. George 'Scott' Samson hours after their wedding on Saturday was so frightened when she called 911 she gave the wrong address.

Ecker, 50, told the dispatcher her address was 4205 N. Creal St. instead of 4025 and when officers eventually arrived at the newlyweds unmarked Terre Haute mansion, it was 15 minutes after the Indiana nurse's first panicked call.

Officers found Ecker dead in a bedroom having suffered multiple shots to her head and neck from a .40 caliber semi-automatic handgun and after using a remote camera discovered Samson, 54, dead in the basement from a self-inflicted gun shot wound.

Tragedy: George 'Scott' Samson and Kelly Ecker married on Saturday evening and returned to Samson's Terre Haute home for their wedding party

Speculation from witnesses after the wedding alleged that an argument over money during the reception sparked the fatal argument, specifically about a financial pre-nuptial agreement.

One wedding guest who spoke to Indystar said that Dr. Samson, who worked at Union Hospital in Terre Haute, became visibly annoyed during his wedding reception at the Ohio Building and left without his wife.

Another guest said that they noticed the frosty atmosphere between the couple once they had returned to the couple's home for an after-party and saw they were not talking.

The last guest who left at 1.17am, asked Ecker if she wanted to stay with her that night. Ecker said no.

At 1.20am, Ecker made the first of four calls to 911 and told the dispatcher that her husband was going to kill her.

The phone hung up before the dispatcher could verify her address and the address did not show up in any mapping system the police use.

She phoned back three times and on the final call, gunshots were heard to ring out, at which point the phone went dead. 

According to Advance Indiana, the reception had been changed from the newlywed's home to the Ohio Building at the last minute and the marquee tent set up in their garden still hauntingly sits outside their home.

Police said that Samson shot his wife multiple times with a 40-caliber handgun and records show that the Terre Haute doctor held a Federal Firearms License, which effectively enabled him to trade and sell weapons from his property - in a manner similar to a gun store owner.

Indeed, according to Advance Indiana, police recovered a literal arsenal of weapons from the home, including assault rifles, hand guns and several hundred rounds of ammunition. 

'They had just gotten married and something went terribly wrong,' said Vigo County Coroner, Dr. Susan Amos.

'He shot her and then shot himself. We are still in a second autopsy to confirm that.'

Witnesses told the IndyStar that the couple had argued at the end of their reception and the final guest left anesthesiologist Samson's home at 1.17am.

Ecker, a nurse at Union Hospital, phoned 911 at 1.20am after witnesses said their argument about money spiraled out of control.

'The investigation has revealed that there was an verbal argument between the couple toward the end of the reception, which carried over to the after party at the couples' home,' said Vigo County Chief Deputy Sheriff Clark Cottom in an email to the IndyStar.

'Shortly after the last guest left at around 1:17 a.m., Kelly Ecker Samson called 911 reporting that her husband had threatened to kill her. 

'There were a total of three very brief 911 calls, which in the first two the caller disconnected.'

Cottom said that Ekcer was found in the bedroom her 10-year-old son from a previous relationship slept in, while Samson shot himself once in the head with a registered gun.

'Deputies did find the female victim inside the child's bedroom deceased,' said Cottom to WISHTV.

Cottom said that Ekcer's son and an elderly couple believed to be Samson's parents were inside the home at the time of the shooting, but were not harmed and escorted out by police when they arrived.

'We received information from the elderly male that the female's husband Scott Samson had retreated to the basement,' said Cottom to WISHTV.

Kelly: '4205 North Creal.'

Dispatch: 'Ok 4205...'

Kelly Interrupts...

Kelly: 'Oh my God!'

(Multiple shots are heard being fired)

Call ends

Samson, 54, is a doctor at Union Hospital in Taure Haute and one witness told WISHTV that guests left the wedding party because of the argument that the newlyweds were having.

'They were having some domestic problems at the house. Within a short amount of time guests decided it would be best if they left. Shortly after the last guest left that's when things went terribly wrong,' said Cottom.

When police arrived, they discovered the basement locked and so had to call out the Terre Haute Police Department Special Response Team.

'The remote camera was able to determine he was in the basement, unresponsive,' said Cottom.

Friends such as Brooke Llewellyn took to Facebook to express their grief at the loss of their friend.

'Never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine on this day that our time as friends would be cut so short,' wrote Brooke.

'You will forever be remembered by many as the most outgoing and energetic woman'
