This is the eerie photo  British tourist Gareth Jones, 25, posted days before he slipped from the 90-metre cliff (pictured) at North Head on Sydney's northern beaches 

Gareth Jones, a well-known BASE jumper, fell to his death after climbing over a fence at North Head on Sydney's northern beaches at about 6.45am on Sunday 

Police investigating his death don't believe he was thrill-seeking at the time. Instead, he and friends had walked to the edge of the cliff to watch the sunrise. Mr Jones is believed to have slipped before plummeting to his death.

Only a few months before his tragic death, the extreme sportsman - whose Facebook displays footage from a variety of his international jumps - leapt from the top of the Menara Tower in Kuala Lumpar.

'Survived KL with an amazing crew of people! What an epic adventure that was,' Mr Jones had written of the event.

Other photos show the adventure-thirsty tourist jumping into canyons in Australia in the months leading up to his death.

Tributes have poured in for Mr Jones since his death and a number of his friends have taken to social media to pay their respects to a 'beautiful soul' and 'proper mate', many writing: 'fly free'.

A number of Mr Jones's friends have taken to social media to pay respect to a 'beautiful soul' and 'proper mate', many writing: 'fly free'

None of the messages were as poignant as the tribute posted by Echo Giesel Widmer, who described the 25-year-old as 'wild child' who 'wanted to be free'.

'He was loud the day I met him, and he was loud the last day I hugged him and squeezed him before saying goodbye. He was never boring, he always challenged the norm. He made every moment more fun, and exciting. He pulled everyone out of their comfort zones and just let go,' Ms Widmer wrote.

'Ironically he told me and some others a week ago that when he died, he'd be p***** if his friends had a funeral and cried for him. He said he wanted to have a Viking Funeral and he wanted his friends to send him out to sea on a burning ship while celebrating and partying in the moonlight. Gareth wasn't afraid of what the future may bring, he just wanted to live.'

Four witnesses, believed to be Mr Jones' friends, are being interviewed by investigators.

The friends were sitting on the cliff edge when tragedy struck, Inspector Nigel Taylor told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'When they returned to the lookout, the young fella has gone to have a closer look and fallen over the edge,' Inspector Taylor said.

Two of Mr Jones' friends are believed to have used ropes and ladders to climb down the cliff to reach him but found their friend unresponsive, according to Nine News.

25-year-old Gareth Jones climbed a fence at North Head near Manly at approximately 6.45am on Sunday morning, and walked to the edge of the cliff before slipping

Police retrieved Mr Jones' body from the cliff base at 11.30am.

'It looks like a tragic accident and we feel for all of the people that were there and obviously our thoughts will be with his family when we inform them,' Inspector Belinda Caddy told Nine News.

The clifftops at North Head are well known for the panoramic view they show of Sydney Harbour and skyline, and are a popular tourist destination on the northern beaches.

Police are warning visitors to lookouts and coastal areas to stay behind fences and out of restricted areas or risk serious injury or death.
