Deaths from cancer in U.S. have declined continually over the last 20 years, mostly thanks to adults quitting smoking, earlier diagnosis and better treatment, according new research.

The American Cancer Society's annual report, published on Tuesday, show the death rate from the disease fell 20 percent between 1991 to 2010, the latest year for which data is available.

But the research also projects that a total of 1,665,540 new cancer cases and 585,720 deaths from the disease will occur in the U.S. this year. That's around 1,604 deaths per day.

Quitting pays off: 'A big part of this decrease in mortality is certainly linked to the decrease in cigarette smoking,' said Dr William Oh of New York's Mount Sinai hospital

Dr William Oh, chief of medical oncology at New York's Mount Sinai hospital, explained to AFP that the decline in smoking is a major factor for the lower cancer death rates.

'A big part of this decrease in 
mortality is certainly linked to the decrease in cigarette smoking 
because we know that lung cancer is such a lethal disease that once you 
have it, very often you will die of it,' Oh told AFP.Â 

Lung cancer rates began falling in the mid-1980s in men and in the late 1990s in women.

According to the report, these 'differences reflect historical patterns in tobacco use, where women began smoking in large numbers about 20 years later than men.'

The research confirms that lung 
cancer is a lethal killer - more than one out of every four cancer 
deaths is due to that disease.

Combined
 with lung cancer, colon, prostate, and breast cancers are responsible 
for almost half of all the deaths for both men and women.

Terror: Human breast cancer cells dividing. Even by itself breast cancer is projected to be 29% of the new cancer cases in women in 2014

Dr Oh said that patients are being diagnosed sooner and cancer treatments are getting better. But the disease continues to survive medical attempts to completely wipe it out.

'One of the key issues around cancer is it is not just one disease. It is truly multiple diseases,' Dr Oh told AFP.

'It
 makes it hard to find one drug that will treat every single person with
 lung cancer, or one treatment that will work in every single person 
with breast cancer.'

The American Cancer Society's report analyzes how many deaths have been avoided by the declining cancer mortality rates - around 1.3 million deaths between 1991 to 2010.

The research concludes that in men, prostate, lung, and colon cancer will account for about half 
of all newly diagnosed cancers in 2014.

Prostate cancer alone will account for around one in four male cancer cases.

Threat: A colored x-ray of the chest of a 52-year-old female patient with secondary lung cancer. This research confirms that lung cancer is a lethal killer - more than one out of every four cancer deaths is due to that disease

And the report states that in women, the three most common 
cancers this year will be breast, lung, and colon. Even by itself breast cancer is projected to be 29 percent of the new cancer cases in women.

The most impressive drop in cancer rates is among African-American men between 40 and 49. In this group there was a 55 percent decline in cancer deaths between 1991 and 2010.

John Seffrin, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, said: 'The halving of the risk of cancer death among middle aged black men in just two decades is extraordinary.'

Then Seffrin urged caution in analyzing this hopeful figure: 'But it is immediately tempered by the knowledge that death rates are still higher among black men than white men for nearly every major cancer and for all cancers combined.'

Decline in smoking, as well as earlier diagnosis and better treatment is responsible for the fall
