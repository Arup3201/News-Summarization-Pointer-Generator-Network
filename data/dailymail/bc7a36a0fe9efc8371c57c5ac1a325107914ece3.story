A television crew captured this astonishing footage which appears to show a purple disc-shaped UFO hovering about a city construction site.

The production crew in Lima, Peru, were filming a programme when they interrupted it in order to  focus on what appears to be a 'UFO' hovering over the city.

The purple-colored disc-shaped object can be seen hovering in the  sky near a construction site, but so far, there has been no official explanation for the object. 

The purple-colored disc-shaped object (pictured) was spotted hovering in the sky  in the city of Lima, in Peru

The unidentified purple object was seen above this construction site - it can be seen just under the crane

According to Peru This Week, television show 'Alto al Crimen' - an investigative program aimed at preventing high level crime - was shooting an episode in the upscale Miraflores district of Lima on February 10 when they spotted the unusual object.

The show's host, Lima Congressman Renzo Reggiardo, halted an interview in order to allow his camera operator to focus on the strange-looking purple object in the sky.

Eyewitnesses reported seeing the object hovering over the city for up to two hours.

Thousands of people have taken to social media to discuss what they think the mysterious purple object is and the video has already been viewed more than 100,000 times.

The Raelian movement, a UFO religion, are delighted by the spotting and claim the UFO is somehow linked to their initiative to persuade the Peruvian government to build an extraterrestrial embassy in the country

Some suggest it is a drone or kite or a hologram projected into the sky.

Other people believe it could be proof of extraterrestrial life, while one person said that they think it is a 'plastic bag'.

Adding more mystery to the UFO sighting are claims that the UFO is somehow linked to an initiative currently underway by the Raelian movement - a UFO religion - to persuade the Peruvian government to build an extraterrestrial embassy, reports The Examiner.

Raëlism, also known as Raelianism or the Raëlian movement, is a UFO religion that was founded in 1974.

The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim.

Members of this species appeared human and when having personal contacts with the descendants of the humans they made, they previously misinformed (on purpose) early humanity that they were angels, cherubim or gods.

Raëlians believe messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha,Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. 

Erich Rever of the Peruvian Raelian Movement said: 'This UFO appeared right when we held a press conference to present our embassy project plan, which we have submitted to the Peruvian government. 

'Peru must be dear to our extraterrestrial creators, who lived here in ancient times and left many traces, so we're asking the government for permission to build the embassy here.

'It's a wonderful opportunity for Peruvians to understand their past and, more importantly, to consider receiving our creators, the Elohim, who were taken for gods by our ancestors and now ask to be welcomed back. 

'We're hoping the Peruvian government will receive their request loud and clear!'

The Peru chapter of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) is investigating and says it is seeking more eyewitnesses who may have videotaped the purple aerial object from different vantage points.
