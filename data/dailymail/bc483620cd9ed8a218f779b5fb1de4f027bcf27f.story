John Carver has called on Newcastle United’s hierarchy to resolve their vacant head coach position during the next fortnight.

The Magpies – beaten 2-1 by Southampton on Saturday – fly to Dubai for a four-day break on Sunday and do not play again until their trip to Hull on January 31.

Caretaker boss Carver would still like the job on a permanent basis but concedes his chances may have gone after a third defeat in four matches since taking over from Alan Pardew.

Caretaker manager John Carver shows he has passion and desire to be Newcastle boss

Newcastle were denied a late penalty when Jose Fonte handled in the area, and Carver says Robert Madley’s failure to award the spot-kick could prove costly for himself.

‘It’s a penalty, no danger,’ he said. ‘When it smacks you on the palm of your hand it’s a penalty.

‘These decisions can have an impact on people’s future. You need a stroke of luck like that because jobs are decided on decisions such as that.’

Newcastle have spoken to former Lyon boss Remi Garde but he would prefer to wait until the summer were he to be offered the role.

Either way, Carver wants a decision before the end of the month.

‘I want this uncertainty to end – I think everyone does,’ he said.

‘The staff, the crowd, and myself. I still love this and want to do it. But sometimes it’s out of your hands.

‘Everybody isn’t sure what is going on. I think after the result tonight a decision has to be made – whether it’s me or someone else.

‘But you’ve got to win football matches (to get the job).’

Eljero Elia was Southampton’s two-goal hero – scoring either side of Yoan Gouffran’s equaliser – but Carver thought his side were worthy of at least a point.

‘I thought we deserved to get something from it,’ he added.

‘We conceded two bad goals. We were caught out twice by two long balls up to the frontman.

‘We worked on it all week, dealing with Pelle and runners in behind, so it’s disappointing that both goals came in the same way.

‘But we don’t have that cutting edge. When we get in the final third it either breaks down or we don’t have enough leaders to take responsibility and put the ball in the back of the net.’
