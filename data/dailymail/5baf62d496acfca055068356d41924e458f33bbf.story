A Home Office minister has launched an extraordinary attack on the Iraq War inquiry’s decision not to publish secret notes between Tony Blair and George Bush.

Norman Baker said key evidence was being ‘filleted’ and urged Mr Blair to intervene to insist that it is included in the long-delayed official report into the 2003 conflict.

Sir John Chilcot’s inquiry has been condemned as a whitewash over a deal to keep letters and notes of phone calls between the then US and UK leaders private.

Home Office minister Norman Baker insisted the public had a right to know about notes sent between Tony Blair and George W. Bush in the run-up to the Iraq war 

Mr Baker, a Liberal Democrat minister who is a longstanding critic of the Iraq war, told the Daily Mail: ‘The British people have a right to know what was done in their name without it being filleted by those who would like to keep some matters secret.

'Iraq is perhaps the most serious undermining of democracy for decades and we need the full facts. We are now led to believe Tony Blair is happy to have everything published. I urge him now to call for that publicly.'

Last month, Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood vetoed the release of the correspondence in the run-up to the 2003 conflict, insisting that only their ‘gist’ is included in Sir John’s findings.

In them, Mr Blair is said to have promised the US President: 'You know, George, whatever you decide to do, I'm with you.' The official reason for the censorship is that publication would deter prime ministers from speaking freely in private.

But Whitehall sources claim security chiefs and officials in Washington have been firmly against their release.

Sir John said the inquiry now hopes to publish ‘gists and quotes’ from some of the messages. He said this was crucial in order for people to understand the inquiry’s conclusions.

But the letters will not be published in full and any quotes will be kept to the ‘minimum necessary’, and following the protests from the US, no details of Mr Bush’s messages will be published.

Mr Baker’s intervention comes after former prime minister Sir John Major warned that the decision not to allow the Chilcot inquiry to publish the full correspondence would allow conspiracy theories to 'fester'.

He said it was a 'pity' that only the gist of the notes and conversations would be published, and also urged Mr Blair to publicly call for the details to be published in full.

Mr Blair, who is expected to face heavy criticism in the report, has always denied trying to block the release of the messages.

Sources close to the former prime minister insist it is in his interests for the Iraq Inquiry report finally to be published because it will allow him to ‘make the argument’ about why he took Britain to war.

The Chilcot inquiry held its last public hearings in 2011, but publication of its conclusions has been held back by wrangling over the publication of the private communications between Mr Blair and Mr Bush.

Sir Jeremy is said to have backed concerns from intelligence services and diplomats that publishing the documents might jeopardise the ‘special relationship’ between the UK and the US.

Senior Whitehall figures are also said to have expressed alarm at the precedent that would be set by disclosing private discussions between a British prime minister and another world leader.

Sir John is thought to have wanted to publish sensitive material, covering some 200 Cabinet-level discussions, 25 notes from Mr Blair to Mr Bush and more than 130 records of conversations between the PM and the US president, in full.

The deal that was agreed last month between the Cabinet Office and the inquiry broke the deadlock, and means the findings are expected to be published at the end of this year.
