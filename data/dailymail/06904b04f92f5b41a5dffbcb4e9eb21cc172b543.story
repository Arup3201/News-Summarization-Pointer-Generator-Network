A singer who had to learn how to walk again after a childhood car crash releases her debut album this week.

She has already had a top 10 single and Evie Sykes hopes for even bigger things with her self-titled new album.

'I wanted to reinvent myself because I was the ugly girl at school,' says Evie.

The 30-year-old still has to undergo treatment for 
horrific injuries sustained at the age of 12 in an accident caused by a drunken pedestrian in Poland where she was born.

Doctors told her she may never walk again, according to a report in the Evening Standard.

Her English father and Polish mother moved her to the UK two years later where she suffered cruel bullying at school over her injuries and admits saying to her mother: 'Can I just kill myself so you don't have to be embarrassed?'

But after teachers noticed her talent while singing in assembly, Evie was inspired to pursue her dream.

She took piano and signing lessons and upon leaving school at 18 carried on with her studies while working as a stylist for Topshop.

The effort is now paying off as her song Habibi, released last summer, has been viewed 1.5million times on YouTube.com and reached the top 10 in the UK club charts.
