A lounge for residents will be available in the Flower building designed by Genry Partners, as well as a library, chef's table dining room, yoga studio and treatment rooms

Those who have registered with the developers will be able to snap up the properties from October 24.

Designed in a subtle 1930s theme adopted from the Grade-II listed former power station, the five apartment blocks designed by Gehry Partners have been inspired by London's famous John Nash Regency terraces and will sit on either side of pedestrianised shopping street Electric Boulevard.

At the heart of the scheme called Prospect Place, will be Gehry's Flower building - a striking structure which will offer residents a lounge, library, a large chef's table dining room, a yoga studio and treatment rooms.

The Flower building, at the heart of the scheme, is designed by Los Angeles-based Gehry Partners, the architecture firm behind the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao, Spain

London-based Foster + Partners have designed a building inspired by the 1930s which will be topped by one of the city's largest roof gardens offering spectacular panoramic views of London.

It will feature a bar, private rooms for hire, private dining rooms and a screening room as well as a private residents' gym. 

The rippling building, which creates an illusion of waves, will stand in direct contrast to the solidity of the power station. 

There will also be 103 affordable homes, a doctor’s clinic, a commercial gym, a 167-room hotel, as well as shops, cafes and restaurants at street level on Electric Boulevard.

The £8billion project will see the 42-acre site transformed into homes, shops, cafes, offices and public space, including the restoration of the Grade-II listed power station

Rob Tincknell, chief executive officer of BPSDC, said: 'This launch is a very special residential offering; the opportunity to be right above London's newest pedestrianised high street and at the impressive gateway to The Power Station.

'The designs from Foster + Partners and Gehry Partners are unique amongst other London developments and will be extremely creative and exciting places for people to live in.'

Aerial view: The project is divided into seven phases, each designed by specialist architects including award-winning Frank Gehry, and once complete the development is expected to see 25,000 people living and working on site, with 40 million visits anticipated each year
