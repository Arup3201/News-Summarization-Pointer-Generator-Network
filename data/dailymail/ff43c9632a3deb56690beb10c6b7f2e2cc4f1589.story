An art student stripped off in protest after her university refused to display her erotic paintings at an exhibition.

Cat Lee, 22, had her more risqu√© work covered up with bedsheets in the University of Brighton gallery because it was considered offensive.

The most graphic paintings - which are not being reproduced here - show people performing a variety of sex acts.

Stripped off: Cat Lee, 22, dressed in only her bra and pants in protest because the university covered up some of her more erotic artwork

But the student, 22, was so angry with the decision that she stripped to her bra and pants holding a board protesting about the decision.

Tutors said they had a duty of 
care to the public in case children viewed the material in the gallery.

Miss Lee was given the opportunity to restrict entry to her section of the gallery to over 18s only but refused, the university said.

The student, who is half way through her 
fine arts degree course at the Sussex campus, describes herself as a 
painter of erotic scenes.

Artwork: In this painting by Cat Lee, called 'The Idea of Love' two people can be seen kissing

Artist: Cat Lee, 22, refused a request to restrict access to her artwork to over 18s

She said she was 'outraged' at not being able to display her work.

'It was embarrassing standing in front of 200 strangers in my smalls but I was outraged by the attitude of the University to my work,' she said.

'I wanted to make a statement that art is sometimes supposed to shock and confront people. It was my first show at the University but I was ordered to withdraw or cover my work with a sheet which was ridiculous.

'In the end I featured less provocative work of a woman's naked torso. But I was fuming.'

A university spokesman said that some would find the erotic artwork inappropriate.

'The university has a duty care of to the public and this art work was deemed to be sexually graphic and abusive in nature,' he said.

'We had to consider that children could be attending the exhibition and that this work might be inappropriate.

'The student was given the option to display her work in a separate space with appropriate warnings, but she rejected this option.

'Another option was to restrict entry to the gallery to over 18s only, but other exhibiting students felt that this restricted their audience. However, the student did display a less explicit piece of work.'

Miss Lee now plans a week long exhibition in July at the Mowlem Street art studios in East London where she has been promised her more explicit work will not be kept under wraps.

'I expect to keep my clothes on for that one. I was appalled at the University for claiming to be a centre for contemporary art and then banning most of my stuff,' she added.

'I know my work is provocative but it is supposed to be. Visitors should decide for themselves how erotic art should be.

'This is the age of Fifty Shades of Grey. People are more open to erotic material, just not at the University of Brighton.'
