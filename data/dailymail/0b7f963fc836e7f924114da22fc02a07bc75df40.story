This is the hilarious moment a dog driving a Segway was photographed taking his owner for a walk.

A series of surreal images captured by a passing motorist show a white dog driving down a street on a Segway as its owner runs alongside it.

Remarkably, the dog was adept at manoeuvring the machine, which is controlled by its driver's shifts in body weight. Leaning forwards takes the Segway forward, while leaning back slows it down.

The owner was photographed running along beside the dog as it drove the electric Segway

A passing motorist quickly pulled out his mobile phone in order to capture the surreal moment

Long Yao, who took the photos, said the dog knew and was capable of slowing down to stop at the lights

The photos were taken on the streets of Chengdu, the capital of southwest China's Sichuan province

The photos were taken by Long Yao as the pair passed his car in the streets of Chengdu, the capital of China's southwest Sichuan province.

The stunned motorist quickly took out his phone to capture the surreal moment.

He said: 'The doggy also knows to slow down and waits for the lights.

'It was so cute!'

The dog can been driving the electric Segway standing upright much like a human does.

Using its two front paws to grip the handles, it stands stretched out upright and perched on its back legs.

As it does so, its owner runs along beside it, before the two stop side by side at the traffic lights.
