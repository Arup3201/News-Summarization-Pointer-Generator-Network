Manchester United were last out of the hat as they entered the second round draw of the Capital One Cup for the first time in 19 years - and will travel to MK Dons.

United have not been in this stage of the draw since 1995 - when they were famously dumped out by York - but are there this season after failing to qualify for Europe last term.

Last season's beaten finalists Sunderland will face the 2011 champions as they travel to Birmingham.

Gus Poyet's men lost 3-1 to Manchester City in last season's Wembley showpiece but will be confident of another cup run after last season's dramatic escape from Barclays Premier League relegation and a summer of recruitment on Wearside.

League Two Burton, who created the upset of round one by beating Championship Wigan on Tuesday night, will face even higher opposition as they welcome QPR to the east midlands.

Fulham will make the short trip to face west London rivals Brentford while West Ham will host a grudge match against Sheffield United who were relegated by the Carlos Tevez affair in 2007.
