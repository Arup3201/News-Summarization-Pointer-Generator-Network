The U.S. Justice Department is claiming that Microsoft must hand over emails that the company stores in databases in Dublin, Ireland, in a case that is being watched closely by tech companies legal scholars.

The U.S. federal government is claiming that it can force any company that conducts business operations within its borders to comply with warrants for data stored on its databases, even if those databases aren't physically located within the United States.

Several companies that operate within the U.S. keep databases in other countries. Ireland has become a popular location for many of the U.S. tech companies.

The Justice Department, in a brief filed last week, claims that data stored online doesn't fall under the same umbrella of protection provided by the Fourth Amendment as data stored in 'the physical world,' the website ARSTechnica.com reports.

In its brief, the Justice Department cites the Stored Communications Act, which states, which states that a federal warrant requesting records stored overseas must be complied with.

'Overseas records must be disclosed domestically when a valid 
subpoena, order, or warrant compels their production,' the Justice Department wrote in its brief. 'The disclosure of 
records under such circumstances has never been considered tantamount to
 a physical search under Fourth Amendment principles, and Microsoft is 
mistaken to argue that the SCA provides for an overseas search here. As 
there is no overseas search or seizure, Microsoft’s reliance on 
principles of extra-territoriality and comity falls wide of the mark.'

The federal government already has received a favorable ruling in the case - in April, a magistrate judge ruled in its favor, concluding that 'the basic principle that an entity lawfully obligated to produce 
information must do so regardless of the location of that information.'

Microsoft appealed the ruling. It will be heard on July 31.

In its own filings, Microsoft wrote that the ruling could impact companies across the globe.

'Congress has not authorized the issuance of warrants that reach outside 
US territory,' Microsoft’s attorneys wrote. 'The government cannot seek 
and a court cannot issue a warrant allowing federal agents to break down
 the doors of Microsoft’s Dublin facility.'

The company even brought up the level of trust the public has in the government having access to personal information after former NSA analyst Edward Snowden leaked information about the government's surveillance programs.

Other tech companies agree with Microsoft.

According to ARSTechnica.com,  'the tech sector is put "at risk" of being sanctioned by foreign 
governments and that the US should seek cooperation with foreign nations
 via treaties, a position the US said is not practical.'
