Heath Decker is not a man who lets time restrictions stop him from doing what he loves.

When faced with the ultimatum of choosing between playing at his AFL preliminary final or his gridiron championships, the 31-year-old Melbourne man simply hopped into a helicopter and made it to both.

'It was quite rock star-ish,' Mr Decker told Daily Mail Australia.

'I like to do things kind of funky and having the club pay for it, I just went along with it.'

The North Ringwood player said that unable to give up either sport, he took on both games throughout the season, warning his AFL coach that if forced to pick out of the two he would opt for attending his gridiron finals.

It then emerged that his AFL semi final was scheduled for a 6pm kick off in Boronia, leaving him just over an hour for the two and a half hour drive to Bendigoto play alongside the Monash Warriors.

'The idea for a chopper came a few weeks out of the games, we were thinking about how to organise it and we thought "that would be pretty rock-star", but we sort of just giggled about it and it was swept under the rug,' Mr Decker said.

'But then it got a bit more serious closer to the date when the coach of the footy club said "I'd really like you to stay and play" because one of the top guys on the opposition was someone I'd played against a couple of times and I did a good job of it.

'Both our captain and the coach thought it was an important enough game for me to be there for and we knew the guy whose chopper it was so it was a little cheaper.'

The 31-year-old's AFL coach organised for a helicopter to take him from his AFL half finals to his gridiron championships when he admitted he would attend his gridiron game if he was forced to choose

Mr Decker left the AFL game in the third quarter of the game, when his team was 10 goals up against their opposition

In the third quarter of the game, when his team was 10 goals up against their opposition, Mr Decker hopped aboard the helicopter in a nearby field alongside his mother and made his way to the next game of the night. 

'We flew down and asked the pilot if he wouldn't mind doing a fly-by of the field because the boys didn't believe I was getting choppered down and neither did my coach,' he laughed.

'So I texted him so he could look up as we went by and then the pilot put us down about a kilometre down the road where my sister was waiting to pick us up.'

Despite arriving five minutes before the game began, Mr Decker scored a touchdown in the first two minutes of his gridiron game

Each of his teams won that evening, with the Warriors scoring 43 against 14 and North Ringwood being scheduled to play in the grand final in two weeks' time

The football star made it just in time, running across the field in bare feet to join his team mates while still in his Australian rules uniform.

He changed on the sideline with only five minutes to spare before the start of the game.
