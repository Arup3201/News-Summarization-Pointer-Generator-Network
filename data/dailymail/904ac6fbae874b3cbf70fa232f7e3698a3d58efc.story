President Obama took a small group of Republican senators out to dinner Wednesday and paid for the meal out of his own pocket, according to White House officials. 

Obama invited the senators to dine with him at the Jefferson Hotel near the White House, where the pricey menu features lobster 'Thermidor,' foie gras terrine and Moulard duck breast.

The GOP leaders emerged after a two-hour meal feeling generally more optimistic about the prospect of a grand bargain on the deficit.

Sign of approval: Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., gives a thumbs up to reporters as he emerges from the private dinner

'I am more optimistic, just from a personal standpoint,' said Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb. 'Most of the meeting was spent on budget and the way forward and his goal is ours. We want to stop careening from crisis to crisis and solving every problem by meeting the crisis deadline.'

Johanns said he thought the president was 'very sincere' during the discussions.'

Sen. John McCain said little about the conversation, aside from flashing a 'thumbs-up' gesture at reporters outside the Jefferson.

'All I can say is we had an evening that I really appreciated very much,' McCain said. 

In addition to McCain and Johanns, guests included Republican Sens. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Bob Corker of Tennessee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Dan Coats of Indiana, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.

Hoeven said the group discussed ways to address the $85 billion in spending cuts that kicked in on Friday.

'We really did talk about a big deal 
that includes entitlement reform in a way that protects and preserves 
Social Security and Medicare but addresses the debt and the deficit,' he
told The Hill.

What we really talked about is, "How do you get there?"'

He described the dinner as 'very positive, encouraging [and] candid.'

'There was a real commitment, I think by everybody there to figure out how we do come together and that's why we need these kind of discussions and that's why we need more of them,' he said.

A White House official later said, 'The president greatly enjoyed the dinner and had a good exchange of ideas with the senators.'

'All I can say is we had an evening that I really appreciated very much,' McCain said

In another sign of outreach to Republicans, Obama will make a trip to the Capitol next Thursday for lunch with GOP senators. 

'Senate Republicans welcome the President to the Capitol,' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement. 'And I appreciate he took my recommendation to hear from all of my members.'

Obama requested the lunch through his chief of staff. He is also planning to meet with House GOP leaders as well as Democratic lawmakers while he's at the Capitol.
