Prince Harry had a chance to put his uncle skills to good use while doing a round of media interviews to promote the Invictus Games today.

The 29-year-old Prince stopped to pose for a photo a starstruck young girl outside the BBC studios in central London.

Clearly overcome with emotion, the little girl looked on in awe at Harry before he crouched down to her eye level, shook her hand, and cuddled up for a quick photo.

Overwhelmed: On his way into the studio, Prince Harry stopped to have his photo taken with a little girl

The Prince was pre-recording an interview with the radio station, which will be broadcast tomorrow, during which he discussed the Invictus games, which start in September.

The Invictus Games is a sporting event for injured servicemen and women that Harry launched and is a driving force behind.

Wow, a Prince! The little girl looks overcome with awe as she is greeted by the world famous redhead

Thrilled: The young fan looked thrilled as kind-hearted Harry crouched down for a photo

Starstruck: The young girl looked amazed to see the 29-year-old Prince in real life

On air: The Prince was pre-recording an interview with the radio station, which will be broadcast tomorrow, to talk about the Invictus games, which start in September

The games will see wounded soldiers compete in Paralympic-style sports and the prince was kitted out in an Invictus Games T-shirt as he arrived to promote the event today.

Harry was last seen at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow where he cheekily photobombed a picture of New Zealand officials.

He was also reunited with his friend Usain Bolt when he and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met for a chat at the event's Athlete's Village.

The
 Royal trio and the Jamaican sprint star shared a joke and posed for 
photographs in the athletes’ village in Glasgow as hundreds of people 
gathered to catch a glimpse of the visitors.

Bolt
 may have been discussing with the royals what he'll do in the men's 
4x100 relay on Friday, or discussing Harry's 'win' in a race against the star in Jamaica before the London Olympics two years ago.

William,
 Kate and Harry also played ball games with school children after 
meeting some of the host nation’s medal winners at Team Scotland’s 
accommodation.

They
 were joined on their tour of the site by the UK’s most successful 
Olympian, Sir Chris Hoy, who is also chief of the village.

Their
 visit came the day after they joined thousands of spectators at the 
Games, taking in gymnastics, boxing, hockey and swimming.
