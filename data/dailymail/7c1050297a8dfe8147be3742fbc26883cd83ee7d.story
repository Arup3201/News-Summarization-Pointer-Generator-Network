Britain woke up to a freezing morning today as temperatures dipped to -6C in the South and up to eight inches of snow was forecast in the North.

The Met Office has a yellow 'be aware' snow warning in the North and Scotland today, which widens to cover the Midlands tomorrow and on Tuesday.

Gusts of 60mph are expected to create blizzard conditions, with heavy snow expected on high level routes and some accumulations at lower levels.

And more than 50 flood alerts and nine warnings were in place for England and Wales this morning, as well as eight and two respectively for Scotland.

Meanwhile wave swells of up to 50ft are expected off the Republic of Ireland within 24 hours, with ‘super tides’ forecast until tomorrow.

These are caused by the astronomical tide being at an 18-year peak, although the height will not be unusual because the weather is normal for winter.

However, strong winds and higher tides than average have prompted a warning over a flooding risk brought on by large waves in coastal areas.

The Environment Agency said it was urging people to ‘take care near coastal paths and promenades and not to drive through flood water’. 

Overnight rural parts of England saw freezing temperatures, with -6C (21F) in Benson, Oxfordshire, and -7C (19F) observed in the Scottish Highlands.

Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said: ‘It's set to be a very wet and windy day for most parts.

‘Across northern parts temperatures will reach a maximum of around 5C (40F), while the South West will briefly hit 10C (50F).’

Another forecaster, Chris Page, said wind gusts of up to 60mph are likely, especially in coastal areas, adding to the blizzard-type conditions.

He said: ‘It doesn't necessarily mean that every single place within the warning zone will see snow. It's a hit-and-miss scenario [with the showers].’

Icy conditions are forecast tomorrow and Tuesday, as slow melts away leaving a risk of slippery patches on untreated surfaces.

A Met Office warning for 4in of snow today was valid from 6am to 5pm, covering all of mainland Scotland and most of northern England.

Forecast: The Met Office said today will be 'very wet and windy' in most areas - with temperatures only expected to hit 10C in the South West

'Be aware': The Met Office has a snow warning in the North and Scotland today, which widens to cover the Midlands tomorrow and on Tuesday

Environment Agency flood watch: More than 50 flood alerts and nine warnings were in place for England and Wales this morning

Snow in red, rain in blue: Blizzard conditions are expected, with heavy snow on high level routes and some accumulations at lower levels

A separate alert issued from midnight tonight until 3pm on Tuesday covers as far south as the Peak District and also includes a warning for ice.

There was only one report of severe delays on a motorway this morning - between junction 7 and 6A of the M1 near Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. 

In the Lake District, motorists got into difficulties on higher routes. Cumbria Police's road traffic unit tweeted: ‘Kirkstone Pass and The Struggle closed.

‘Several vehicles stranded and RTCs (road traffic collisions). Treacherous conditions. Please do not go there.’

Yesterday snow was seen in parts of Surrey and a light dusting visible in the early hours in London, while Cumbria was covered in several inches.

Commonly referred to as super tides, spring tides or 'super moon' tides, they are governed by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.

In a blog on its website, Met Office analysts said these tides occur when the pull of the sun and moon align and combine. 

When the gravitational pulls offset each other, we get smaller tides known as neap tides. We are currently at the height of these pull increases.

The experts added: 'However, there is a longer cycle at work too, associated with the gravitational pull of the planets in the solar system.

'This means we can see additional, albeit relatively small, increases and decreases in the size of spring and neap tides over long periods of time.'

This is the moment a deer swam through a flooded wetland after being caught out by the highest spring tide in 20 years.

With water rapidly rising to about 7ft, the animal battled through water with only its head above the surface.

But the deer made it to the other side of Steart Marshes near Bridgwater, Somerset, and even stuck its tongue out at the photographer.

It was one of five deer that did not expect the sheer volume and speed in which the wetlands was flooded. But none were hurt.

Photographer Robin Morrison said: ‘I don’t think the deer were bothered. They normally move around and find higher ground.

‘But the volume and speed [yesterday] was a different level. They must have thought “oh, we better get out of here”.

‘They are obviously very good swimmers. They just got to higher ground, had a bit of a shake and then basked in the sun for a while.’
