It has become as much of a festive staple as turkey and tinsel – but now Do They Know It’s Christmas? is getting a very modern update.

Three decades since their charity single first topped the charts, Bob Geldof and Midge Ure relaunched Band Aid yesterday. And while time may have taken its toll on both of them, they proved they have lost none of their youthful passion as they vowed to raise millions for victims of the ebola crisis in West Africa.

The pair are enlisting the help of a string of youthful acts – sprinkled with a few veteran singers – to record a new version of the song which raised £8million for famine victims in Ethiopia in 1984.

All for a good cause: One Direction have joined the line-up for the latest version of Band Aid 30, which will record Do They Know It's Christmas? for the fourth time in three decades 

Joining the fun: Coldplay's Chris Martin and U2's Bono are also getting involved in the remake of the song

Announcing the Band Aid 30 project, Sir Bob, 63, joked he still feels ‘ineffably glamorous and sexy’ with his shock of white hair and husky Irish drawl. Ure, 61, jokingly conceded: ‘We are old. There is no doubt about it. One of us has too much of a hair quota.’

Already expected to go to No 1, the track will be recorded on Saturday and will be available to download from Monday for 99p. A physical copy of the single, with artwork by Tracey Emin, will follow, costing £4. But in a sign of the changing times, Sir Bob said the CDs will not be available for another three weeks because many of the factories that produce them have closed.

It is the fourth time the song has been recorded, but the stars are enlisting a roster of new talent, many of whom are too young to remember the first Band Aid. Contributors will include singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, 23, Jessie Ware, 30, Paloma Faith, 33, Ellie Goulding and Emily Sandé, both 27, and boyband One Direction, none of whom is older than 22.

Inspired: Bob Geldof and Midge Ure (left) were inspired to re-record the song because of the 'phenomenal bravery of the National Health doctors and nurses who volunteered to go out there'

All the big names: Ed Sheeran has signed up and revealed Chris Martin was responsible for getting him involved 

Representing the old guard is U2 frontman Bono, 54, who has appeared in two of the three previous Band Aid recordings, and Coldplay singer Chris Martin, 37, who took part in 2004.

Sir Bob said that the lyrics of the track had to be updated because the new appeal is not designed to combat hunger. However, he said that as in the Ethiopian famine, the root cause of the ebola crisis is poverty, adding: ‘That is radically unacceptable.’ He conceded raising money would be harder because some will try to listen to the track for free on the internet.

But he said: ‘It really doesn’t matter if you hate the artists. It really doesn’t matter if it turns out to be a lousy recording. What you have to do is buy this thing.’

Adele will also perform on the track which will raise money to fight the deadly Ebola virus in west Africa

Hoping for success: Sam Smith will be hoping to surpass the original version, a response to the famine which was causing a huge death toll in Ethiopia, which was released in 1984 and sold 3.7million copies

Have faith: Paloma faith will join the likes of George Michael, Sting and One Direction on the charity single

Irish singer Sinead O'Connor will perform on the single, which will be recorded on Saturday

30 years ago: Bono (left), Paul McCartney (centre) and Freddy Mercury from Queen (right) took part in Live Aid concerts in 1985 - a year after the first Band Aid

Band Aid was first put together in 1984 when Boomtown Rats frontman Bob Geldof and singer-songwriter Midge Ure brought the greatest bands of the time together to record a charity single.

Geldof had been so moved by the famine in Ethiopia that he decided to ring around contacts he had made in the music industry. 

Artists including the likes of Bono, Phil Collins, Paul McCartney, Queen, Bananarama and George Michael met at a studio in Notting Hill, London, where they were given 24 hours to produce the record.

More than 70,000 people filled Wembley for the all-day concert which raised millions for those suffering in the famine in Ethiopia

The musicians worked around the clock, with Boy George flown in by Concorde to record his lines, eventually putting together Do They Know It's Christmas?.

The single topped the charts and sold 3million copies, spending five weeks at number one. 

In 1985, the Live Aid concerts were held at Wembley and at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia.

The the two concerts ran for a total of 16 hours as nearly 2billion people tuned in worldwide to watch the event.

Artists who were not on the original 1984 track, such as The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and Madonna took part in the concerts, which raised £150million for the Ethiopian famine.

A second version of Do They Know It's Christmas? was released in 1989, with new artists such as Jason Donovan, Kylie Minogue and Cliff Richard.

The single reached number one again, where it remained for three weeks.

In 2004, 15 years later, Sir Bob announced that Band Aid would reform to raise money for the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, Sudan.

Bono, Paul McCartney and George Michael were the only artists from the original recording to sign up for the single, which shot to number one, where it stayed for four weeks including Christmas.

Bono and co., were joined by the Sugababes, Robbie Williams, Will Young, Chris Martin and dozens more.

Sir Bob's last Band Aid outing was in 2005, when Live 8 saw musicians collaborate to pressure world leaders to give more aid to African nations

Dizzee Rascal was the only person to add lyrics to the track with a rap section which he improvised on the day of the recording.   

In 2005, ten concerts were held worldwide for Live 8 - intended to put pressure on the heads of state of G8 group of nations, who were meeting in Scotland, to pledge more money to tackle hunger in Africa.

After the concerts, which included most of the artists on the 2004 track, the G8 pledged to double aid to some African nations to $50million a year.

This week Bob Geldof announced Band Aid would return to raise money to fight the deadly Ebola virus, which has killed thousands in western Africa.

The single will be recorded on Saturday, November 15 and released on Monday, November 17.
