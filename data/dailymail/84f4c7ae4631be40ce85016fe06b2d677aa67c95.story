Atletico Madrid chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin has described the violent clashes that left one Deportivo La Coruna fan dead and several people injured as 'disgusting' and said there is no place in football for the 'scum' responsible.

Trouble erupted before Atletico's home Primera Division match with Depor on Sunday morning and resulted in the death of a man in his 40s.

The man, who has not been named officially, was still alive when firefighters pulled him out of the Manzanares river near Atletico's home ground.

In a critical condition, he was taken to the San Carlos Clinic in Madrid by ambulance but died shortly after.

'A patient, a male in his 40s, arrived at the hospital with cardiac arrest and suffering from hypothermia. Despite lengthy attempts to resuscitate him, he could not recover from the cardiac arrest and died,' Isabel Diez, press officer at San Carlos Clinic, told Press Association Sport.

'We don't know the exact causes as only an autopsy can determine.'

The running battles between rival 'ultras' - hardcore supporters - reportedly started around 9am in the vicinity of Atletico's Vicente Calderon stadium ahead of a match that began at midday local time (1100GMT).

According to El Pais newspaper, 20 people have been arrested and more identified following the trouble which lasted for around an hour and was said to have involved up to 200 people. Among those injured, three were reportedly from stab wounds and a policeman was also hurt.

Gil Marin said on his club's website: 'It's disgusting, that scum has no place in football. I only hope they identify those responsible and they can't repeat such deplorable acts as these.'

The Atletico chief also distanced genuine football fans from the trouble, adding: 'This is a social issue linked to political thoughts because hooligans of Rayo are coupled with hooligans the Deportivo to fight with hooligans of Atletico Madrid. 

'This isn't football, it has nothing to do with that. It's a disgrace and deplorable. We will listen to the police and authorities and decide what measures can be taken beyond those which have already been taken, which are many.

'If someone is able to identify who has done it, please report it, because it's very important that those responsible end up in prison. Also, let all the people of football join together to try and avoid a repeat of this tragedy.'

Depor president Tino Fernandez echoed those thoughts, although he said he was not aware of the exact details of what had happened.

He said: 'It's tragic and horrendous news. Our thoughts are with the family of the deceased. We are at his family and friends' complete disposal to help them in any way we can.'

Depor coach Victor Fernandez said after the match: 'It's one of the saddest days in Spanish football in recent years. They are reprehensible and despicable acts.'

Spanish league authorities (the LFP) also condemned the trouble and had wanted the match - which was won 2-0 by Atletico - to be postponed but said it was not possible.

The LFP also offered their condolences to the family of the man who died, as did the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF).

RFEF general secretary Jorge Perez also explained that, after only receiving information about the seriousness of the incidents just before kick-of, it was considered 'counter-productive' to postpone the match due to security reasons.

He said in Marca: 'Eleven minutes before the start of Atletico Madrid-Deportivo, Victoriano Sanchez Arminio (president of the referee's committee) received a call from the LFP and another from the match referee.

'He spoke with a member of the RFEF and, with the stadium full and little time left, for reasons of security and public order it was decided that it could be counter-productive to suspend it.'
