Nasa's planet-hunting Kepler telescope is broken, potentially jeopardisng the search for other worlds where life could exist outside our solar system.

If engineers can't find a fix, the failure could mean an end to the £400 million ($600 million) mission's search - although Nasa says it may still be able to save the ailing telescope.

The telescope has discovered scores of planets but only two so far are the best candidates for habitable planets.

Kepler is a space observatory launched by Nasa to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. Data from Kepler could help humans find alien life

The Kepler space telescope orbits around the Sun, 40 million miles from Earth.

It is named after 17th Century astronomer Johannes Kepler.

It was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets.

During that time it has confirmed 132 planets and spotted more than 2,700 
potential ones.

In December 2011, Kepler found a new Earth-sized planet orbiting a star just 352 light years away.

It was found lurking in the Kepler star field and was named Kepler-21b.

Its parent star, the HD 179070, is so close it can be
 viewed with a home telescope.

However, Nasa scientists said there’s very little chance of it hosting life because the surface is a  1627C (2960F).

Kepler's mission was supposed to be over by now, but last 
year NASA agreed to keep Kepler running through 2016 at a cost of about
 £13 million ($20 million) a year.

According to Nasa scientists, there is, what's dubbed, a 'Goldilocks Zone' in space where the temperature is not too hot, or too cold, for water to exist in liquid form.

Any planets found in this zone could have life on them.

If Kepler is retired, Nasa scientists believe the search for other lives on planets could be severely hindered.

'I wouldn't call Kepler down-and-out just yet,' said Nasa sciences chief John Grunsfeld.

Nasa said the spacecraft has lost the second of four wheels has stopped working.

These four wheels control the craft's orientation in space.

With only two working wheels left, it can't point at stars with the same precision.

In orbit around the sun, 40 million miles from Earth, Kepler is too far 
away to send astronauts on a repair mission, in the same way Grunsfeld and 
others fixed a mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope.

Over the next several weeks, engineers on the ground will try to restart Kepler's faulty wheel or find a workaround.

The telescope could be used for other purposes even if it can no longer track down planets. 

Kepler was launched in 2009 in search of Earth-like planets.

So far, it has confirmed 132 planets and spotted more than 2,700 
potential ones.

Its mission was supposed to be over by now but last 
year, Nasa agreed to keep Kepler running through 2016 at a cost of about
 £13 million ($20 million) a year.

Last month, Kepler scientists announced the discovery of two distant planets that scientists believe have the ideal environments to harbour life.

This is the space telescope Kepler's field of view, superimposed on the night sky so that the main stars are visible. In its four-year history, Kepler has confirmed 132 planets, and found 2,700 new ones. Some of the discoveries may harbour life

The 
other planets found by Kepler haven't fit all the criteria that would 
make them right for life of any kind of life - from microbes to man.

While ground telescopes can hunt for planets outside our solar system, 
Kepler is much more advanced and is the first space mission dedicated to
 that goal.

For the past four years, Kepler has focused its telescope on a faraway 
patch of the Milky Way hosting more than 150,000 stars, recording slight
 dips in brightness - a sign of a planet passing in front of the star.

Now 'we can't point where we need to point. We can't gather data,' 
deputy project manager Charles Sobeck told The Associated Press.

Scientists said there's a backlog of data that they still need to analyze even if Kepler stopped looking for planets.

'I think the most interesting, exciting discoveries are coming in the 
next two years. The mission is not over,' said chief scientist William 
Borucki at the Nasa Ames Research Center in Northern California, which 
manages the mission.

Scientists who have no role in the Kepler mission mourned the news.

Nasa engineers preparing the Kepler for launch. The space telescope launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets. Its four wheels control its orientation and now two have broken. Deputy project manager Charles Sobeck said because of this fault: 'we can't point where we need to point. We can't gather data'

They
 said the latest loss means the spacecraft may not be able to determine 
how many Earth-size planets are in the 'Goldilocks zone' where it's not 
too hot or too cold for water to exist in liquid form on the surface.

And while they praised the data collected by Kepler so far, they said 
several more years of observations are needed to nail down that number.

'This is one of the saddest days in my life. A crippled Kepler may be 
able to do other things, but it cannot do the one thing it was designed 
to do.'

Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, who is not 
part of the Kepler team, said in an email.

In 2017, NASA plans to launch TESS - Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite - designed to search for planets around nearby stars.

Nasa engineers are attempting to restart the wheel from Earth because the craft is too far away to send a rescue mission

If the wheel can't be restarted, the four-year mission may have to be abandoned
