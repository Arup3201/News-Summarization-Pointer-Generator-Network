George Osborne today faced calls to rein in his multi-billion mortgage guarantee scheme to only cover homes worth less than £260,000.

The Help to Buy scheme risked creating ‘distortions’ without changes the head of the OECD economic think tank warned.

Critics have warned the scheme to make it easier for people to buy a home is helping to fuel demand, pushing up prices across the country by 10 per cent.

Under the £3.5billion equity loan scheme, introduced in April last year, first-time buyers and home movers can get help to buy a property worth up to £600,000.

Around 35,000 homes have been bought using it so far, amid claims Britain is not building enough houses to cope with rising demand.

But Angel Gurría, the OECD's secretary general, has called for it to be more than halved to prevent a new property price bubble.

He suggested cutting the threshold to the average house price of £262,000 before ‘winding it down’ altogether, The Times reported.

Mr Gurría said: ‘It was a good idea and it worked. Now the economy is back on track. The price of houses has gone double digit.

‘Do you still really need the mechanism? You need to think about moving towards normality before distortions set in.’

‘I would lower the cap. I'd take it down to the average [house price].’

UK house prices rose by 10.5 per cent in the year to May, according to the Office for National Statistics.

It includes a 20.1 per cent rise in London, although ministers insist the biggest beneficiaries of the Help to Buy scheme have been outside the capital.

In May, house prices paid by first-time buyers were 11.3 per cent higher than a year earlier, compared to a 10.1 per cent increase for those already on the housing ladder.

Downing Street insisted David Cameron remains behind Help to Buy for 'supporting responsible lending'.

A spokesman said the average house price paid under the scheme is £190,000 compared to the UK average of £262,000.

'It is clearly helped first-time buyers and others to get on the property market,' the spokesman added.

The government is remaining vigilant about the scheme and the Chancellor has asked the [Bank of England's] Financial Policy Committee to keep an eye on this.'
