Netty Edwards, 46, was left distraught after being told she had to drop out of the Spen 20 Race in Spenborough, West Yorkshire, for being 'too slow'

A keen runner who has completed a host of charity races and half-marathons was forced to quit a 20-mile race after just 1.4 miles because marshals told her she was 'too slow'.

Netty Edwards, 46, was left distraught after being told she had to drop out of the Spen 20 Road Race in Spenborough, West Yorkshire, because the race 'wasn't for people like her' and that marshals wouldn't wait for her to finish.

The race organisers, Spenborough & District Athletics Club, had not specified a cut-off time for the race in its terms and conditions, but the mother was apparently told to stop despite running at a pace of 12 minutes per mile.

If she had been able to complete the race, she would've finished in four hours if she had remained at the same pace.

Mrs Edwards, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, who runs to work every day and has a host of medals from previous races she has completed - including the Great North West Half Marathon - was left in tears at the decision.

She immediately took to social media to vent her frustration, writing: 'Well this a first… 1 and a half miles in and pulled off the course for being too slow lead marshal says his team r not to stay out as long as it's going to take me !!!!! (sic).

'He cycled up to me and says u r way behind u r far too slow. It's not for ppl like u (sic).'

She later posted a photograph of all the medals she has previously received from completing races alongside the message: 'Well they might not be fast times but all well and truly earned… didn't soddin want ye medal anyway #Spen20 (sic).'

She claims a marshal cycled up to her as she approached the 1.5 mile stage of the race on Sunday and told her to stop. The race, which had up to 400 entrants, costs £11 to enter.

Hundreds of people have now taken to social media to condemn the race organisers and support Mrs Edwards – who is a keen charity runner.

Paula Wilson said: 'She was told to stop running as she was too slow 12min mile pace. I wouldn't say was slow.'

Sarah Hamilton said: 'I'm so mad on #NettyEdwards behalf. #ThisGirlCan & this girl should've been left alone to get on with her run. Shame on you #SpenboroughAC.'

And Sarah Browne added: '#Spen20 horrible treatment of the awesome #nettyedwards today & so discouraging to anyone 'slow'. Boo.'

The mother took to Facebook to vent her frustration after allegedly being told by a race organiser that she was 'too slow' at 12 minutes per mile and that race marshals wouldn't wait for her to complete the race

Mrs Edwards said the pace shouldn't matter and that it is the taking part that counts. She said she runs to and from work every day in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and has previously raised money for charity by running

However, despite the support, one racegoer and organiser responded by claiming it is standard practice to pull people from the race if they are too slow.

Ian Ogden replied to Mrs Edward's post online and said: 'I believe you were aware that you could start earlier but decided not to it is standard practice for race organisers to withdraw marhsalls at a cut-off point 12/13 min miling as a RUNNER that has done many distance races you must be aware of this. (sic).'

He followed it up with another post which said: 'Thanks for all the publicity you have created for our fantastic event.

'Netty I'm sure it will ensure our race goes from strength to strength and you will be welcome back next year now that you are aware that starting early is the best option by the way we are a really friendly club that caters for all abilities (sic).

Frank Reddington, of Spenborough & District Athletics Club which organised the Spen 20 Race, said: 'I am sorry that the day was spoiled for Annette. 

'The race is a well established mainly club runners event and while we are accommodating a level of slower runners who enter, we do not have the resources to facilitate people who do not have a reasonable level of fitness to take part in this race.'

Mr Reddington confirmed that Mrs Edwards had her entry fee refunded.
