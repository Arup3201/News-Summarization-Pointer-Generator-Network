At least 30 people were killed in Yemen this morning when a suicide bomber drove a minibus packed with explosives into a crowd of cadets gathered to enrol at a police academy.

At the scene of the blast in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, the dead lay piled up against a wall. Water sprayed by firefighters to extinguish the fire mixed with their pooled blood.

A police officer's certificate sat in a pool of blood and water, soaked crimson. The bomber struck as lines of cadets waited outside of the academy, preparing to enrol, witnesses said.

'What happened is we were all gathering and ... (the bomber) exploded right next to all of the police college classmates,' eyewitness Jamil al-Khaleedi told The Associated Press.

'It went off among all of them, and they flew through the air.'

Dozens more people were wounded in the explosion, officials initially said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorised to brief journalists.

The blast was heard across the city and a large plume of smoke was visible near the college in a heavily congested part of the city near the central bank and the defence ministry.

A charred taxi cab smoked near what remained of the minibus, yards from a gate for the police academy.

'The situation is catastrophic. We arrived to find bodies piled on top of each other,' a paramedic at the scene told Reuters as ambulances took casualties away.

'We found the top part of one person yelling, while his bottom half was completely severed.'

A policeman told Reuters that another car had been passing as the bomb went off and was set on fire along with everyone inside.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Yemen's local al-Qaida branch, targeted in frequent U.S. drone strikes in the country, has carried out similar attacks in the past.

Washington considers al-Qaida in Yemen to be the world's most dangerous branch of the terror network as it has been linked to several failed attacks on the U.S. homeland.

The blast comes after Shiite rebels known as Houthis seized large areas of Yemen, including Sanaa, in September as part of a protracted power struggle with President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.

Their critics view them as a proxy for Shiite Iran, charges the rebels deny.

Al-Qaida militants have targeted the rebels in bombings in the past. An al-Qaida suicide bomber killed at least 24 people on December 31 in an attack on Houthis as they commemorated the birth of the Prophet Muhammad.

Most attacks in the past four years have targeted Yemen's security infrastructure. A suicide bomber killed more than 90 people in May 2012 at a military parade, and a coordinated assault on a military hospital a year ago killed more than 50.

The crowd at the academy this morning included both Houthi rebels and police cadets, witnesses said.
