A no kill dog shelter taking in abandoned pooches took 32 unwanted Chihuahuas in a single delivery.

The animals, many bought as fashion accessories, were housed by Precious Pups Rescue in New York from pounds across the US.

Founder, Laura Zambito, took in the huge canine delivery last month and is now looking to rehome the animals.

Ms Zambito said: ‘This is the biggest single delivery of chihuahuas I've seen and just goes to show the numbers being abandoned.

‘Chihuahuas became a fashion accessory after they were seen in the purses of Hollywood celebrities like Paris Hilton.

‘They are currently the second most euthanised dog in America and thousands of Chihuahuas are killed every year.

‘People need to understand that they are living creatures and they need to be loved and taken care of.’

Ms Zambito expects the number of abandoned Chihuahuas to rise in the new year as dogs given as Christmas presents may be given away.

She said: ‘Chihuahuas are being euthanised at a high rate because they are misunderstood - their numbers are rising in shelters.

Ms Zambito explained that huge numbers of chihuahuas are being abandoned as they become less fashionable

‘I can't bear the thought of these dogs being killed in such high numbers so I will do what I can to give them a home.

‘A dog shouldn't be given as a gift. A dog is for life, not just for Christmas.’

Ms Zambito said many people abandon Chihuahuas because they do not understand their personalities and don't train them the right way.

She said: ‘Chihuahuas are a very loyal dog. If you don't nurture them enough, or overly nurture them, they get overly possessive and nippy.

‘I personally love the breed because they all have their own quirky personalities and they're very protective.

‘Many people think that small dogs like Chihuahuas don't need to be trained like big dogs, they think they just sit there and look cute.

‘They do need to be trained and be given boundaries just like big dogs.’

According to Ms Zambito, there is an overabundance of Chihuahuas in some US states because dogs stay outside, breed and wander around without owners.

Many of the dogs that are taken to Precious Pups Rescue are from South Carolina, Texas, Georgia and Florida.

Ms Zambito said: ‘I'd say about ninety percent of the dogs here would have been dead if we hadn't taken them in.

‘Dogs are euthanised differently depending on the shelter. Sometimes dogs are killed by what's called a heart stick, they put a needle in the heart and the heart stops.

‘Other shelters will sedate the dogs - worst case scenario they will put them in a box and gas them to death.

‘There is nothing humane at all about euthanising a dog merely because of space.’

There are currently 60 dogs living at Precious Pups Rescue.

Ms Zambito said: ‘There's so many of them and they all have such short hair, so five or six of them cuddle up in one bed together - it's the cutest thing.’

While Ms Zambito is saving as many dogs as she can, she wishes she can take in more dogs.

‘When I can't save a dog, it's heartbreaking because they haunt you and they stay with you forever because you know you're their link to a new life and to life period.’
