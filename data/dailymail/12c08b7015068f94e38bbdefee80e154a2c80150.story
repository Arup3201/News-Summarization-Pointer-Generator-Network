A convicted pedophile has been sentenced to 690 years prison by a Florida judge.

Judge Chet Tharpe handed Christopher Renshaw, 28, the maximum sentence on Wednesday for sexually abusing three boys, the youngest of whom was 10 at the time.

The six-foot-three-inch 240lb Hillsborough man threatened the boys, sexually abused them and recorded the acts on digital video cards.

Shocking: Christopher Renshaw was given the maximum sentence for his crimes against three young boys

The abuse began in 2009 when the three young boys, relatives of Renshaw's, moved with their mother into Renshaw's mother's home.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, Renshaw sexually abused the boys, aged between 10 and 15, and beat them if they resisted.

He also taped the abuse and made threats to prevent the boys from telling their mother about it.

The three boys, the youngest now aged 14, testified in court about their ordeal.

They spoke of their lives since the abuse and their constant fear of being alone, their questioning of their own sexuality and terrifying flashbacks to the abuse. The Tampa Bay Times reports that Renshaw cried and tried to block his ears while his victims spoke.

Renshaw's attorney told the court that his client was a victim of sexual assault himself.

'This young man has problems that are not of his own making,' attorney Scott McCluskey said.

'Judge, punish him. But don't make him die in prison.'

McCluskey told the court that Renshaw
had been sexually abused from the age of five, as had almost all his 17
brothers and sisters.

A
psychologist told the court that Renshaw is intellectually disabled and
the abuse he suffered as a child led to substance abuse issues.

Prosecutors sought the maximum sentence for Renshaw, whose crimes 'made seasoned investigators cringe.'

'Christopher Renshaw did horrible things to these children,' said Assistant State Attorney Aaron Hubbard.

'I believe he's a monster. I don't believe he deserves to ever be out of prison ever again.'

Renshaw lived in Valrico until he was arrested in 2011. In August, he pleaded guilty to more than 30 sexual abuse charges.

Before he was sentenced, Renshaw spoke for himself to the judge.

'I would like to have some help,' he said through sobs, reports the Tampa Bay Times.

'I'm sorry for the things I've done. I just ask for a chance. Please.'

Judge Tharpe was unconvinced.

'If ever there was a person that society needs to be protected from, it's you, Mr. Renshaw,' Judge Tharpe said.

'I have an intervention for you and it's long and it's called Florida State Prison.'

Renshaw was given the maximum sentence on each count, a total of 690 years prison.
