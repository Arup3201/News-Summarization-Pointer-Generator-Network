Blasted: Josef Hecken received a torrent of criticism for his claims that beer cures mental disorders

A bottle of warm beer is better than psychotherapy, a German health official has advised.

According to Josef Hecken, chair of the country's statutory health system, a drink can heal minor illnesses like sleep disorders.

Speaking at a debate, he also ridiculed the inclusion of psychotherapists in Germany's healthcare provision.

His comments have provoked outrage among leading medics claiming he has trivialised severe mental disorders.

Dieter Best, chairman of the German Association of Psychotherapists, attacked Hecken's suggestion as 'unspeakable' in an open letter.

He wrote: 'You trivialise and ignore the needs of our patients with your bottle of beer metaphor.

'And you subtly stigmatise people with severe psychiatric disorders.'

The letter, published in German newspaper Tagesspiegel, also blasted Mr Hecken for saying it was a 'cardinal sin' the government incorporated psychotherapists into the national health service.

Before 1999, people with mental disorders were transquilised instead of receiving therapy, Mr Best exclaims.

In a desperate bid to backtrack, Mr Hecken issued a statement describing his suggestion as 'unfortunate' and 'misunderstood'.

He said: 'I, as an individual, do not regard every indisposition, such as difficulty falling asleep, as a pathologic condition that requires treatment.

Cure? Leading medics have written an open letter blasting the comments for 'trivialising severe mental disorders'

'Sometimes the old home cure of a bottle of warm beer helps me.

'I am aware that there are significant interdependencies between alcohol consumptiona nd pscyhological diseases, which are documented in studies.

'The last thing I want to do is to trivialise psychological diseases or to even describe alcohol consumption as an appropriate alternative for psychotherapeutic treatment.'
