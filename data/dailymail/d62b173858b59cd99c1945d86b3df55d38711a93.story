Rich tastes: Miss Paltrow

She is the Oscar winning actress turned self-proclaimed ‘lifestyle coach’ who believes that women can transform their lives by adopting healthy diets and fitness.

Now Gwyneth Paltrow has released a series of specialist recipes to help her followers launch themselves into a new year with a ‘Warming Winter Detox.’

But those not on Hollywood salaries may find Paltrow’s latest creation a little too much to take – ingredients for her peppermint hot chocolate will cost £50.

One of her previous culinary creations led a food critic to claim she had a ‘Marie Antoinette detachment from reality’ and true to form, the recipe, published on her much-ridiculed lifestyle blog Goop, contains a number of highly expensive ingredients.

Among the baffling list are almond butter, mint flavoured liquid chlorophyl, spirulina powder and the optional addition of chocolate flavoured protein powder, that makes it sound more like the makings for a chemistry experiment than a hot drink.

All this to disguise the fact that though the name may sound like an indulgent treat Paltrow’s version of the cold day classic only contains a couple of tablespoons of raw cocoa and no sugar at all.

Instead, like all the recipes that feature in her detox it also avoids any dairy, gluten, shellfish, sugar, caffeine, condiments, alcohol and any other additives.

Fans who want to save themselves some cash may resort to leaving out the ‘optional’ chocolate protein powder but even without it the other ingredients are unlikely to be found for less than £38.

It's detox o'clock! Gwyneth Paltrow, an avid foodie, has unveiled a January detox menu, which she promises doesn't feel like a sacrifice

And that is not to mention the fact 
that most the ingredients can’t be found in normal supermarkets and need
 a trip to specialised health food shops.

Opening
 the latest post on the site Paltrow writes: ‘You know we love a good 
detox here at goop and this January is no exception.’

Despite
 its prescriptive demands she promises readers that her three-day detox 
menu ‘won’t leave you feeling cold and hungry during the winter’ and 
offers eight recession-busting detox tips including ‘take saunas’ wear 
‘organic cotton.’

Paltrow
 has faced persistent criticism over the advice she posts on Goop with 
many mothers accusing her of having lost her a grip on the real world.

She
 has spoken proudly about her daughter Apple’s choice to become a 
vegetarian, a decision she came to ‘entirely on her own’ at the age of 
just seven.

She also 
refuses to let Apple, now nine or seven-year-old son Moses eat gluten or
 dairy products and once infamously told an interviewer: ‘I’d rather 
smoke crack than eat cheese from a tin.’

In
 December she used Goop to recommend that for Christmas, one should buy 
friends a £100 Fornasetti scented candle and take a £65 set of Hermes 
poker cards as a ‘hostess gift.’

Hard at work: Gwyneth and her team joined forces with a nutritionist to create some healthy recipes for her Goop fans to enjoy

Last
 Spring her post on ‘spring wardrobe essentials’ provoked ridicule when 
it emerged that they totalled £293,878 and included a silk skirt from 
Temperley London, costing £992, and Chloe trousers at £1,200,

In
 2011 she released her cookbook ‘Notes From My Kitchen Table’ which had 
frustrated readers searching the aisles of their local supermarkets for 
vegenaise, agave nectar and oven roasted kale crisps.

But
 she has defended lifestyle advice saying she is the victim on 
mean-spirited critics saying: ‘Pat of the problem is people get hit of 
energy when they are negative about something.

‘They don’t understand why they don’t have a happy life, I feel sorry for them.’

Paltrow became a household name in 1998 when her part in Shakespeare in Love won her the Oscar for best actress.

Thanks
 to her burgeoning lifestyle empire she now limits herself to just one 
movie a year, for which she can command up to £15 million.

And today she launched a January detox meal plan, which she promises is 'warming, filling and doesn't feel like a sacrifice'.

Writing on her site Goop, she says: 'You know we love a good detox here at goop, and this January is no exception.

What, no carbs? Plenty of herbal teas, salads, soups and oily fish feature on Gwyneth's menu

'We
 created detox recipes that won't leave you feeling cold and hungry 
during the winter months, with guidance from Dr. Alejandro Junger, a 
specialist on the subject.

'We
 took to the test kitchen to create a three-day menu of detox recipes 
that are warming and filling and don't feel like a sacrifice.

'We
 then turned to Dr. Alejandro Junger for some info on how to best detox 
during the cold winter months. Dr. Junger contributed the warm shakes - 
the rest of the recipes are from the goop kitchen.'

The menu advises detoxers to start the day with room temperature water and lemon, followed by a herbal tea and special shake.

Lunch consists of either a balsamic miso root salad or chickpea or carrot soup (bread rolls not included, obviously).

If
 you're feeling peckish in the afternoon, Gwyneth suggests snacking on 
walnut lentil pate or a handful of nuts before feasting on coconut 
poached salmon, quinoa stuffed squash or pan-steamed chicken and 
broccoli for dinner.

'Adjust the times to your schedule and the meals to your taste,' advises the actress.

Wise words: Gwyneth, who last year released a cookbook with her dietary tips, writes a weekly lifestyle blog

Foodies
 will be delighted to hear that this winter detox is much less strict 
than ones Gwyneth and her team have created in the past.

'Our winter detox has looser 
guidelines and restrictions than ones we’ve done in the past but', she 
adds, 'here is what we’re avoiding: dairy, gluten, shellfish, anything 
processed (including all soy products), nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes,
 peppers and eggplant), condiments, sugar, alcohol, caffeine and soda,' 
she writes.

The mother-of-two is well-known for her strict health regime and even released her own cook book, It's All Good, in 2012.

According to the book's synopsis, after a
 gruelling schedule and overindulgence in 2011, Gwyneth was 
left feeling fatigued and faint and a trip to the doctor later revealed 
that she was anaemic, vitamin D deficient, and that her stress levels 
were sky high.

Her doctor prescribed an elimination 
diet banning coffee, alcohol, sugar, eggs, wheat, meat and processed 
food to clear out her system and help her body heal.

Now we can ALL look like Gwyneth: The detox eliminates dairy, gluten, shellfish, anything processed (including all soy products), nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and eggplant), condiments, sugar, alcohol, caffeine and soda
