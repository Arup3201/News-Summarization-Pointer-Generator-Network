Manchester City are considering a move for Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez despite closing in on a £30million deal for Wilfried Bony.

City are wary of interest from Liverpool and Tottenham – who are both monitoring Rodriguez closely – and are keen to beat them to his signature.

Rodriguez has a significant new contract offer on the table from Southampton, who are urging him to extend his stay on the south coast. 

Manchester City are considering a bid for Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez 

Southampton are adamant they will not sell Rodriguez, but an offer over £20m will tempt them into letting him talk to another club. 

The 25-year-old has no intention of making a decision on agreeing to those terms with the club until he is back fit and playing again.

Rodriguez has been out since April after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in a Premier League match against City.

The injury wrecked his chances of going to the World Cup with England, which he looked certain to after earning his first call-up to the national team that season and being on a run of scoring five goals in four games before the devastating blow.

Last season, he netted 17 times in 40 games in all competitions and was in the best form of his Southampton career since his £6m move from Burnley in 2012.

City are also closing in on the £30m signing of Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony

City have already agreed a transfer fee with Swansea for Bony – starting at £25m but which could rise with add-ons – and terms with the player who is set to earn £100,000 per week on a four-year contract.

But they will not let that stop them beating their rivals to one of the most coveted English forwards in the Premier League.

Rodriguez is close to a return to football and is set to play in some Under 21 games for Southampton ahead of returning to the first team.

Saints hoped he would be back playing last month but there was a slight delay on his recovery.
