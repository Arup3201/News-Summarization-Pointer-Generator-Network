Keene State student Ellery Murray told The Boston Globe she was at a party that had drawn a large crowd when people started throwing things.

She said police responded in riot gear and used tear gas to break up the crowd.

'People were just throwing everything they could find — rocks, skateboards, buckets, pumpkins,' she said. 'People just got too drunk.'

As the night wore on, students overturned cars and fires were lit on a street near campus

New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan said state and local safety officials worked to defuse what she called 'the situation.'

College President Anne Huot said in an emailed statement that the festival has been promoted by others 'as a destination for destructive and raucous behavior' and the college had tried on the front end, in working with the city and campus, to prevent this from happening.

'We deplore the actions of those whose only purpose was to cause mayhem,' she said, adding that the students involved will be held accountable.

As the night wore on, students overturned cars and fires were lit on a street near campus.

'We got calls from our parents saying be careful,' one unidentified man told WBZ-TV.  

The riot attracted its share of attention on Twitter from people mocking the white, affluent students. 

'How you get arrested in head to toe LL Bean though?!  tweeted Charles Wade.

'I heard the chili used in the pepper spray isn't even organic or fair-trade.” OMFG!!!' he joked.

The hastag #pumpkinfest was tagged to even more jokes.
