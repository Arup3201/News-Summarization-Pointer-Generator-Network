A man who organized a liaison with another man through the gay dating app Grindr viciously attacked him with a hammer before biting him and attempting to rob him, authorities have said.

The unnamed victim needed surgery for a damaged eyelid and staples to shut a wound to his head after the allegedly violent attack by Curtis Rosenblat near Seattle, Washington in March.

Rosenblat, 23, was arrested trying to board a plane at Sea-Tac Airport on May 7 and has now been charged with assault.

During his arrest, Port of Seattle police were forced to shock him with a Taser, Deputy Prosecutor Michelle Larson wrote to the court, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported.

Rosenblat had used the sex app Grindr to message and arrange a meeting with the man on March 22, and the alleged victim picked him up near his apartment at 3am.

The pair searched for a secluded place to have sex but when they could not find one, they went to Rosenblat's apartment, a Seattle detective told the court, the Post-Intelligencer reported.

They were naked inside his home when Rosenblat tried to kick the other man out without his belongings, the detective said.

The men began fighting and when Rosenblat left the room, the alleged victim tried to grab his items, but Rosenblat returned with a hammer and began beating him, the detective said.

'When the hammer was not
 enough, the defendant then began to viciously bite the victim,' Larson told the court.

A woman in the apartment tried to break up the fight and the man fled, police said.

The victim called police and the female witness told cops that Rosenblat had told her he 'wanted to get the guy's stuff'.

Rosenblat has been splitting his time between Massachusetts and Washington, and was arrested at the airport last week, where a scuffle with police officers ensued.

'The defendant is clearly a danger to the community,' Larson said.

Rosenblat faces a second-degree assault charge for the attack and a charge for assaulting a police officer. He remains jailed on $115,000 bail.
