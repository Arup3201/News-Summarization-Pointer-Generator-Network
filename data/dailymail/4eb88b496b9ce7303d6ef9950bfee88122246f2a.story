The hosts are the most successful team in World Cup history and if they are to add to their five tournament wins they must get past a country becoming known for going far in major competitions without winning them. 

Head-to-head 

In their 21 meetings, Brazil have won 12 with Germany recording just four victories. They have faced each other just once in a World Cup, Brazil winning 2-0 in the 2002 final. But in their last match,, a friendly in August 2011, Germany won 3-2.

What Brazil are worrying about...

They are missing their two best players — Neymar has a fractured vertebra in his back and centre back and captain Thiago Silva is suspended. The pair have been superb, Neymar providing the goals and flair and Silva dominating at the back.

What Germany are worrying about...

It could get messy. The Brazilians have been criticised for their brutal, aggressive style of play on the way to this semi-final.  They have committed the most amount of fouls in the tournament and have their midfield enforcer Luiz Gustavo back from suspension. The Germans will expect a few heavy challenges.

What the bookies say

It’s close, but the bookies are giving Brazil (6/4), playing at home and more used to the conditions, the edge over Germany (9/5). 

Where can I watch it? 

BBC One from 8.30pm  (kick-off 9pm).

This could turn into the Lionel Messi v Arjen Robben show with both players having been instrumental in getting their sides this far, but they have more than enough star quality around them to turn this into a mouthwatering fixture.

Head-to-head 

Holland have been the stronger side, having won four of their eight meetings to Argentina’s one victory — but that one came in the 1978 World Cup Final.

The last time they met was in the group stage of the 2006 World Cup in South Africa, which ended in a goalless draw.

What Holland are worrying about...

Lionel Messi. He scored four goals in the group stage to haul Argentina through, and while his team-mates have shrunk on the big stage, he has been virtually unplayable.

What Argentina are worrying about...

They have a plethora of talent but have struggled to integrate it in a way that would allow them to crush their opponents.

What the bookies say 

Argentina (5/4) have been made the firm favourites, well ahead of Holland (11/5).

Where can I watch it? 

ITV1 from 8.30pm (9pm kick off).
