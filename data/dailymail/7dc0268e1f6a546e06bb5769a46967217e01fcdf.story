She's the single mother of two who sparked outrage when it emerged that she'd had a £4,800 breast enlargement operation on the NHS - but it seems that Josie Cunningham still isn't happy with her body.

Despite claiming that the surgery was needed to make her feel 'womanly', the aspiring glamour model says she's now so desperate for a reduction, she's turned to escorting to pay for it.

This time, however, Cunningham, 23, plans to pay for the operation herself after a cancer scare made her change her mind about wasting NHS funds.

New leaf: Ms Cunningham says she has turned to escort work in a bid to refund the NHS for her boob job

'I'm desperate for a boob reduction and I feel so bad about using NHS funds for my breast enlargement,' said Cunningham, who lives in Leeds with her two sons.

Speaking to Closer magazine, the former shop assistant added: 'I'm raising cash from escorting to pay for it.'

And escort work appears suit her, with Ms Cunningham describing it as 'a great job' and claiming that the toughest part is trying to avoid falling in love with clients.

'I enjoy sex so it's not like it's a chore and the free dinners are great - it's like being paid to date,' she revealed. 'I charge £450 for dinner and £1,000 for the night including sex. It's much better than scraping by on minimum wages working in a shop!'

Ms Cunningham's surgery story began in January last year, when she was given a taxpayer-funded £4,800 breast enlargement operation which boosted her measurements to a 36 DD.

Despite being initially thrilled, just four months later, she decided her new-look bust was too big and approached the NHS about having them reduced.

But just months later, Cunningham suffered a skin cancer scare - a fright that left her embarrassed about wasting taxpayer's money on a breast enlargement.

'I realised I was wrong to think I deserved the cash for my boob job as much as anyone else with an illness - there are far more worthy causes.'

Now, she says she not only plans to pay for her own breast reduction, but also hopes to reimburse the NHS for the amount spent on her original operation.

But after failing to make headway via the Just Giving page she set up, Cunningham chose to turn to escort work instead - and admits that she has no plans to quit.

'I thought I'd give up when I made enough money for the reduction and to pay back the NHS but I've been splashing out on gifts for my family instead.'

She added: 'I don't care if people think selling my body is bad - I love it. It's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm proud to be making my own way.'
