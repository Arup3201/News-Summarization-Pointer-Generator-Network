A U.S. Census report revealing the nation's fastest growing states in the last year has seen the population flocking to the nation's best places for the warmest weather, lowest taxes and one with an oil rush to boot.

Topping the list, North Dakota was found having secured a 2.2 per cent growth over the last year - three times the national rate - after becoming the second highest oil-producing state behind Texas.

In close second, the District of 
Columbia was found with a 2.1 per cent growth, Texas with 1.7 per cent, 
Wyoming with 1.6 per cent, and Utah with 1.5 per cent.

Top states: With a 2.2 per cent increase, North Dakota dominates the list in booms with the District of Colombia coming in second

Oil boom: Trucks sit outside a row of temporary housing units for oil workers in Tioga, North Dakota after an oil rush made it the second largest oil state last year just behind Texas

Using figures collected between July of 2011 and July of 2012, the report attributed North Dakota's oil rush to its boost of 10,000 additional residents.

But what may come as more of a surprise is their high unemployment rates.

While North Dakota is benefiting from a rare 3.0 per cent unemployment rate it's a stark contrast from the other top nine boomers who together average 8.1 per cent.

In comparison, Nevada, found in 10th place for positive domestic migration and sixth for fastest growing, has seen a 12 per cent unemployment rate. D.C., ranked second on both lists, has seen a rate of 8.9 per cent.

In contrast to population boom, states 
experiencing the fastest exit by residents are New York, Illinois, New 
Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island according to the report with the one exception of New Mexico - in fourth place - linking colder climates between them.

Housing boom: Workers in North Dakota work to construct homes with the oil boom putting pressure on the state's tight housing market

As far as taxes go, four of the top 10 states were found with the lowest rates in the country - those being South Dakota, Wyoming, Texas and Nevada.

High birth rates are also credited in four of the top 10 states of Texas, D.C., Colorado and Nebraska.

Among the top states nation-wide, however, Utah was found with the highest rate with 12.8 per cent, Alaska in second with 11 per cent, Texas with 8.3 per cent, California with 7.2 per cent, and D.C with 6.8 per cent.

Interestingly the report notes Mormonism as responsible for this growth, with Utah, Idaho (with 6.7 per cent growth) and Nevada having the highest concentrations of Mormons in the U.S.

Floundering in that category - however leading in deaths - are Maine and West Virginia whose population are said to be seeing more deaths of baby boomers than births.

In all, the U.S. population was found now increasing a bit faster, thanks to an improving economy, but not enough to lift growth above its lowest level since the Great Depression.

The nation is getting older and is less likely than before to be married, with women waiting longer to have children, if at all. Immigration from other countries is on an upswing after years of sharp declines during the recession but may never return to the peak level it reached in the early 2000s.

The 2012 estimates released on Thursday offer the latest snapshot of the U.S. population, showing signs of revival and change in pockets of the U.S., especially in Sun Belt states hard hit during the recent recession.

'After decades of wars, a depression, immigration surges, baby booms, boomlets and busts, we are entering a new era of modest growth,' said William H. Frey, a demographer at Brookings Institution who analyzed the numbers. 'This is a result of our aging population, lower fertility rates and immigration levels that will probably not produce sharp population spikes.'

As a whole, the U.S. population grew by 2.3 million, reaching 313.9 million people. That growth rate of 0.75 per cent was higher than the 0.73 per cent rate in 2011, ending five years of slowing growth rates. Nevertheless, the rate of growth remains stuck at historically low levels not seen since 1937, restrained by reduced childbirths.

Over the last year, the economy has shown improvement, with the unemployment rate declining modestly and U.S. migration edging up after hitting a record low in 2011. As a result, states including Texas, North Dakota, Colorado, Oregon and Virginia posted population growth increases as many young adults moved out from their parents' homes, seeking to test the job market in areas with thriving economies in energy or technology.

Still, the nation continues to get older, due to aging baby boomers and fewer people in their child-bearing years. Newly released census projections now show that U.S. growth may have largely peaked, barring a significant and sustained increase in new immigrants. The numbers put U.S. growth in the next year or two at just under 0.8 per cent, before flattening and gradually falling to rates of about half a per cent, a level unseen in more than a century.

U.S. growth reached a high in 1950 of more than 2 per cent, lifted by the post-World War II baby boom.

Immigration to the U.S. was on the uptick in 2012 after falling significantly during the downturn, although it remained far from the level seen during the mid-2000 housing boom. Congress is expected to debate an overhaul of immigration law next year.

'We will now need to cope with population challenges that past growth has left us — notably, the needs of a large aging baby boom population which will require resources for its medical care, and the social and economic integration of first- and second-generation immigrants,' Frey said.

The Census Bureau released state population estimates as of July 1, 2012. The data show annual changes through births, deaths, and domestic and foreign migration.

The data suggest that the impact of the recession on formerly fast-growing Sun Belt states may be waning. Nevada had more residents move into the state this year after suffering migration losses in previous years. Arizona and Florida, two other housing boom-and-bust states, also showed renewed migration gains after seeing their growth drop off sharply at the end of the last decade.

In all, 26 states grew faster this year compared to the previous year, of which 19 are in the South and West region.

'These gains remain far smaller than those each state experienced during the economic boom, but reflect considerable improvement over the situation at the depths of the recession,' said Kenneth Johnson, a sociologist and senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire, referring specifically to Arizona, Nevada and Florida.

In contrast, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey saw more residents move away compared to the previous year.

North Dakota grew faster than any state in the nation, climbing by 2.2 percent from July 2011 to July of this year. The District of Columbia was next-fastest growing, followed by Texas, Wyoming and Utah.

Two states lost population: Rhode Island and Vermont.

Kimball Brace, president of Election Data Services, said if the 2010 census had been held this year, Minnesota would have lost a seat in the House of Representatives and North Carolina would have picked up one due to the shifting population figures. Based on continuing losses, Rhode Island is now on track to lose one of its two seats with just 33,000 people to spare — potentially to the gain of Oregon, which is about 59,000 people away from gaining a sixth seat.

California remained the most populous state, followed by Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois.
