A Briton emerged today as one of the many heroes of the devastating typhoon after saving dozens of people trapped in their hotel rooms on a holiday island.

Electrical engineer Jonathan Fitzpatrick kicked in hotel doors and led families to safety moments before walls of the hotel were swept away by 235mph winds battering Leyte island.

The 23-year-old from Walsall, West Midlands, was one of many Britons on holiday in the Philippines who found themselves caught up in the rescue and relief operations.

In the province of Leyte, 10,000 are feared to have died in Tacloban, 580km (360 miles) southeast of Manila, where survivors said waves hit their homes ‘like a tsunami’.

I'm safe! Mr Fitzpatrick gives the thumbs-up to his family over Skype after they feared the worst having not heard from him for 33 hours

Some were even volunteering for the 
Red Cross in the capital Manila today, offering to stay on to help the 
massive relief operation facing the beleaguered country.

Mr
 Fitzpatrick was with four workmates who found shelter and protection in
 a stairwell at the Ormoc Villa Hotel but hearing panic in nearby rooms 
from people unable to open their doors because of the sheer strength of 
the wind, he kicked them in and led families to safety at the three-star
 resort.

Today, he 
was able to relay his story to his anxious family, who had alerted him 
initially that a huge storm was on its way so he had been able to warn 
others.

But it was not for 33 hours that he was able to tell them he was safe.

His sister Rachel, 25, said: 'Because we had prepared him and told him about the storm, he and his mates went out of the room and started to tell people to get back inside.

'That lasted about 20 minutes and he said when the storm came back it was about 100 times worse and the wind direction had changed, so instead of people trying to keep their doors closed, they were getting trapped in their rooms as they could not open their doors.

'He admitted he thought that was going to be it. But he decided he didn't want to go like that, and he wanted to go fighting.

'He
 and his friends started kicking doors down to get the families out of 
their rooms and into the stairwell, and taking bottled water to hand out
 to people.

'He said that in some rooms there were entire families, with eight children huddling on the bed.'

Courageous: The electrical engineer was in the Pacific country working on a power station

Mr Fitzpatrick's family told how they 
had witnessed his workmates - who were in the Pacific country to work on
 a power station - struggling to hold their hotel door closed when he 
made the long-distance video call on Skype.

He spoke to each member of his family individually to speak to them for what could have been the last time.

After
 losing contact, they had to wait almost a day-and-a-half to hear 
whether he had died in the violent weather conditions but then on 
Saturday morning he sent a text to girlfriend Kirsty Smith, 21, to tell 
her he had escaped unharmed.

She
 said: 'It was a very big relief. When we spoke to him before losing 
touch, he told us "I don't want to worry you, but I love you all".'

Meanwhile, another Briton Tim Harding, from Sunderland, said he was one of many foreigners who were volunteering at a Manila Red Cross centre in the storm's aftermath.

Mr Harding said he had planned a holiday to the nation's capital with his wife, who was originally from the Philippines, but it had instead become a volunteer mission.

'There's only one priority here and that's to get together, get stuck in and do the greater good,' he said.

'It's good to see everyone getting on, doing a job where race, nationality, income level, nothing matters at all.

Mr Harding said he would help wherever he could for the next few weeks and it was a mind-set shared by other foreigners hailing from not only the UK, but elsewhere in Europe and the world.

He said there were mixed emotions in the recovery centre, with many locals also helping out to take their minds of the devastation.

'There's a lot of panic going on here,' he said.

'Although we just got some good news a few minutes ago that a three-year-old child had actually been rescued in the debris at a place in Tacloban city.

'There was a big cheer that went up.'
