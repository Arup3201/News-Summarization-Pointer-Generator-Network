Four police officers involved in the fatal pursuit of Brazilian student Roberto Curti in Sydney's CBD have lost their bid to have the criminal case against them dropped.

Mr Curti died in the early hours of March 18, 2012, following a chase and violent struggle with police in which he was Tasered, handcuffed, hit with capsicum spray and knelt on.

Police officers Scott James Edmondson, Chin Aun Lim, Daniel David Barling and Damian John Ralph have since been charged over the alleged assault on Mr Curti.

All four have pleaded not guilty.

However, earlier this month their legal team had applied to permanently stay proceedings against them.

Magistrate Mark Buscombe on Tuesday rejected the application. 

In a hearing on November 3, Barrister Bret Walker SC told Downing Centre Local Court they were making an application to stay the proceedings against the officers.

The prosecution case against the four had been tainted by directed interviews which took place in the days after Mr Curti's death, Mr Walker said.

During the interviews, officers were 'compelled' to answer questions by threat of disciplinary action and therefore their answers should not have been used against them.

Instead, Mr Walker argued, the interviews became 'inextricably entangled' in the ensuing investigation of them.

This meant the prosecution case was 'rooted in an eradicable error', he said.

Barrister Bret Walker SC argued that the prosecution case against the four police officers, including Chin Lim (pictured) had been tainted by directed interviews, which took place in the days after Mr Curti's death

But Crown Advocate Natalie Adams SC, appearing on behalf of the attorney-general, said only three pages of Lim's interview had ever been handed to the DPP.

If the admissibility of the interviews was in question, Ms Adams said there should be an application for that evidence to be excluded.

'This is not a basis for a stay,' she said, adding that should be a 'last resort'.
