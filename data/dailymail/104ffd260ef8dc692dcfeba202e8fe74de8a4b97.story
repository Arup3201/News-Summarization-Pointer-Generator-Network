The old brigade are being pointed towards the exit at Old Trafford, and Patrice Evra is happy enough to be included among the veterans who have been made surplus to requirements by Manchester United manager David Moyes.

The long-serving left-back may not be quite so pleased, however, to discover that age has counted against him over where he goes next.

Inter Milan had him on their list of full-back targets, along with Arsenal’s Bacary Sagna, as they formulated plans to make at least three signings this summer.

Surplus to requirements: Patrice Evra is expected to leave Manchester United, but may not end up at Inter

Snub: Bacary Sagna has decided not to make the move to Inter

Sagna’s decision to snub them, revealed in the Transfer Column earlier this week, appeared to leave the way clear for Evra to complete a dream move to the San Siro. But in a change of policy, new Inter president Erick Thohir has ruled that Evra, who turns 33 in May, is too old to be part of their recruitment drive.

Thohir wants the accent to be on youth, and it now seems likely that 19-year old Ibrahima Mbaye will be given a chance at left-back after spending a successful season on loan at Livorno.

The new approach leaves Evra pinning his hopes on Paris St Germain and Monaco for a fresh start in the summer.

New look: David Moyes will have to revamp his whole defence this summer

Roberto Martinez is beginning to talk up Everton’s prospects of overhauling Arsenal for the fourth Champions’ League spot with good reason – it holds the key to securing Romelu Lukaku on a permanent deal at the end of the season.

Chelsea are likely to listen to offers for Lukaku in the summer, and Tottenham are showing a strong interest in taking him to White Hart Lane.

But the big Belgium striker has settled in well on and off the pitch at Goodison Park and would not take much persuading to turn his season-long loan into a permanent deal.

Falling out: Lukaku angered Jose Mourinho earlier this season by saying he would consider staying at Everton

After upsetting Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho earlier this season by saying ‘stay at Everton – why not?’, he is wary of going public with his thoughts.

But he has evidently made it clear in private that his dream would be to play Champions’ League football in the blue of Everton next season.

Martinez would have to spend a large chunk of his £20million budget on making it happen, but no-one could dispute it would be money well spent after his impact so far on Merseyside.

Manuel Pellegrini is facing the galling prospect of being pipped by Real Madrid once more in a scramble for one of La Liga’s up-and-coming prospects.

After heading for The Etihad Stadium last summer, as replacement for the sacked Roberto Mancini, he was desperate to return to his old club Malaga for attacking midfielder Isco.

It became a straight fight with Real, which Pellegrini lost when the highly-rated playmaker headed for The Bernabeu in a £24million deal.

Hot property: Mallorca teenager Asensio has dazzled in the Segunda Liga

Now the emerging talent in question is 18-year old Real Mallorca winger Marco Asensio, and Pellegrini once more has his work cut out.

The City manager is a huge admirer of Asensio’s dazzling wing play and feels he would have little difficulty adapting to the Barclays Premier League.

But worrying for him, Real are already on the case and making plans to meet the teenager’s £3.3million release clause.

It goes up to £7.4million next year, but Real are confident of acting before then and seeing off competition from a host of top European clubs headed by City.

Selection: Isco decided to choose Real Madrid rather than join Pellegrini in Manchester

Ross McCormack has stayed loyal to Leeds United throughout this season’s escalating crisis and continued providing the sharpest of cutting edges, despite bids for him being rejected from the likes of West Ham, Cardiff City and Middlesbrough.

He kept giving his all, even when West Ham and Cardiff had £5million deadline-day offers rebuffed in the January window and throughout the ensuing fiasco of manager Brian McDermott being sacked and reinstated in the space of 24 hours, amid uncertainty over who owned the club.

His days at Elland Road do appear numbered, however, with several clubs jostling for position ahead of a summer scramble to sign him.

Turmoil: Leeds are currently stuck in a financial crisis with players not being paid on time

Crystal Palace, QPR and Fulham are leading the way, but Leeds may just have missed the boat over raking in some much-needed cash.

Mindful of the Championship club’s parlous state, with the threat of administration hanging over them, the three London suitors are likely to offer only a fraction of the Scotland striker’s original valuation.
