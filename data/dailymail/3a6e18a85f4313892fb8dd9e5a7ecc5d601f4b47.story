Zlatan Ibrahimovic took in his first game of the 2014 World Cup as the Paris Saint-Germain star watched Spain crash out with a 2-0 defeat against Chile on Wednesday night.

The Swedish striker has been forced to sit the summer tournament out after his national side failed to beat Portugal in their World Cup play-off last year.

Ibrahimovic seemed to be hooked on the action while being flanked by PSG president Nasser Al Khelaifi, Laurent Blanc and his son Maxi.

The 32-year-old is promoting a new mobile app which will offer, 'A personal insight into Zlatan’s everyday life: football, Paris, the National Team and much more.'

The former AC Milan striker was pictured arriving in Rio on Wednesday and posing with the tournament's official mascot Fuleco the Armadillo.

It is not yet known whether Ibrahimovic has travelled to South America as a fan or for commercial reasons, although he will have no shortage of team-mates to watch if he decides to take in some more live action.

Thiago Silva and new signing David Luiz are both plying their trade for home favourites Brazil, Edinson Cavani will be looking to shoot down England with Uruguay on Thursday and French duo Yohan Cabaye and Blaise Matuidi starred in Les Bleus' opening 3-0 win against Honduras.

Marco Verratti and Salvatore Sirigu are looking to progress from Group D with Italy, while Ezequiel Lavezzi is battling the likes of Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero for a place in Argentina's starting XI.
