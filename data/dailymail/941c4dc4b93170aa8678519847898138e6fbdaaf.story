A Saudi Islamic preacher accused of torturing his five-year-old daughter to death has been sentenced to just eight years in jail and 600 lashes.

Lama al-Ghamdi died in October 2012 having suffered multiple injuries. Her skull was crushed, a finger nail had been pulled off, her ribs and arm broken and she suffered extensive bruising and burns.

There were also reports that she’d been repeatedly raped, though this was denied by her mother.

Lama spent ten months in hospital before succumbing to her injuries

The case sent shockwaves around the 
world earlier this year and there was further outrage when it appeared 
that her father, Fayhan al-Ghamdi, would be released by a Saudi court after just a few 
months in prison.

The mother, Syeda Mohammed Ali, told CNN in February: 'My dear child is dead, and all I want now is justice 
so I can close my eyes and know she didn't die in vain. She was brutally
 tortured in the most shocking ways.'

A campaign began to force the court, in the town of Hawta, to stiffen the sentence.

The same court and judge july 
re-examined the case, but there is anger once more that the punishment 
for Al-Ghamdi, a prominent Islamist preacher who regularly appears on 
television in Saudi Arabia, is too lenient.

Earlier this year activists from the 
group Women to Drive said the preacher had doubted Lama's virginity and 
had her checked up by a medic.

Randa al-Kaleeb, a social worker from
 the hospital where Lama was admitted, said the girl's back was broken 
and that she had been repeatedly raped.

Her injuries were then burned.

Rather than the death penalty or a 
long prison sentence, the judge in the case ruled the prosecution could 
only seek 'blood money', according to activists.

The money is compensation for the next of kin under Islamic law.

Activists said the judge ruled the 
few months al-Ghamdi spent in prison since his arrest in November 2012 
was sufficient punishment.

He has reportedly agreed to pay £31,000 ($50,000), which is believed to have gone to Lama's mother.

The amount is half that would have been paid if Lama had been a boy.

A social media campaign quickly gained momentum after the ruling was publicised.

Manal al-Sharif launched a campaign 
on Twitter using the hashtag 'Ana Lama', which means ‘I am 
Lama’, calling for better protection for children and women.
