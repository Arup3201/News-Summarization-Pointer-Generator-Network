To celebrate the new partnership, Coral are offering special bets on Wigan to punters, including 3/1 on the Warriors winning the Grand Final and 5/1 on Josh Charnley being the Top Regular Season Tryscorer.

Coral will be the official sponsor of Wigan Warriors for the 2015 season.

The bookmakers' logo is to replace current sponsor Houses for Homes on their home and away, playing and replica kits.  

Warriors sales director Geoff Warburton said: 'We are ecstatic to be welcoming such a distinguished company as Coral into the Wigan club and the sport of rugby league.

'As a forward thinking company, Coral have adapted to the online betting market exceptionally well and are exactly the kind of organisation that will help drive the brand of Wigan Rugby League forward.'

As well as being on their shirts, LED advertising will be used at each of Wigan's home games, too. 

The Warriors are the most successful rugby league club in the world, and were the 2013 Super League and Challenge Cup winners. 

Matt Prevost, Coral's interactive marketing director, added: 'This is Coral's first sponsorship venture into Rugby League, so we are delighted to be partnering with the most successful Rugby League club in Britain.'
