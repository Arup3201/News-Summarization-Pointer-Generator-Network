A young mother from Essex popped into 
the toilet at the medical centre, andÂ after a very short labour had a baby 
she did not know she was expecting.

Emma O'Doherty, 24, who had not been feeling well for a few days, gave 
birth to little Harry in the waiting room toilets at Harold Wood Polyclinic
 in Romford last Friday.

Miss O'Doherty had left work at Creative Kids Nursery for a check-up at the GP walk-in clinic because she wasn't feeling well.

Shock: O'Doherty, 24, went to the toilet and 10 minutes later had a baby she did not know she was expecting

Doctors and nurses rushed to help the 
mother-of-three and waiting patients were asked to leave as she had her 
surprise baby in a cubicle after only 10 minutes labour.

Her amazed partner Gary Beechey, 28, said: 'She had not been feeling well for a few days and thought she had an infection so her friend took her to the polyclinic.

'Emma went to the toilet and she called me asking me to come because she had bad stomach pains.

'I got there just in time as the baby came along!'

Emma O'Doherty, who already has a 
daughter, Louise, seven, and son, George, three, could not have been in a
 better place for the birth but was still terrified.

'I will never forget Emma's face when I walked in the bathroom, she was so frightened.

'It was worrying enough for me but it was her body,' said Mr Beechey, a roofer.

Out-patient Jake Portsmouth said he was waiting for an appointment with his GP as the incredible drama unfolded.

He said: 'It was so weird that it was happening in the room next to me and I didn't hear a thing.

'I think it was a huge shock to everyone.

'It was one of the most surreal things.'

Polyclinic staff said they were 'absolutely delighted' to help and 'nobody panicked' as Ms O'Doherty  had the third child she never expected.

Members of the public, who had been cleared out of the centre, were very understanding and cheered the thrilled family as they left.

Mr Beechey added: 'It was a very emotional moment although I had difficulty taking it all in.

'But I can't praise the polyclinic enough, they were fantastic.'

An ambulance took the family to Queen's Hospital, Romford, where Miss O'Doherty and her little boy were kept under observation until Tuesday before they were allowed home.
