A United Nations worker infected with Ebola has died in hospital in Germany despite intensive medical treatment.

The 56-year-old man was being treated at the St Georg hospital in the eastern German town of Leipzig after being admitted five days ago.

Local health officials said last week the patient was a Sudanese doctor who had arrived in Germany from Liberia.

The man had tested positive for Ebola on October 6 and was put into an isolation unit  in Germany

He is one of three people infected with Ebola to be treated in Germany. 

One of the others, from Senegal,  was released in good health from a Hamburg clinic after five weeks' treatment and has returned to his home country. 

The other, a World Health Organization employee from Uganda, is still receiving treatment in Frankfurt after contracting the virus in Sierra Leone.

The dead man, who tested positive for the virus on October 6, landed shortly after 5am last Thursday in a modified Gulfstream jet equipped with an isolation chamber, Sky News reported.

The patient was brought to hospital under police escort last week

He was met at the airport by a medical team in biohazard suits and two ambulances. 

Doctors said at the time his condition was 'highly critical, but stable.'

In a statement on Tuesday, the hospital said: 'The patient sick with Ebola fever died during the night in St Georg Clinic in Leipzig. Despite intensive medical measures and maximum efforts by the medical team, the 56-year-old UN employee succumbed to the serious infectious disease.'

The World Health Organization  estimates the death toll from the worst outbreak of Ebola on record to have exceeded 4,000. It has called the outbreak the 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times'.

West Africa is the worst affected area. In Liberia more than 2,300 people have died, while in Sierra Leone and Guinea stands at nearly 1,000 each.

Health officials in Europe, the United States and elsewhere are rushing screening measures into at entry points from affected countries to try to stop the spread of the deadly virus. One man had died in the United States from Ebola.

The death in Germany comes as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs it is 'likely' Ebola will reach the UK and that a 'handful' of cases could be confirmed in the next three months.
