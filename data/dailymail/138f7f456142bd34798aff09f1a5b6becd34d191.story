A 21-year-old former private school girl, who police claim had descended into a life of drugs and crime, has been charged over the attempted murder of a man who was killed two months later in a brutal attack at his home.

Jessica Honey Fallon - from Byron Bay in New South Wales - and two others who were paid to kill 46-year-old Michael Martin broke into his home in April last year, stabbed him and assaulted his friend who was staying the night, police will allege. 

Mr Martin, from South Murwillumbah, survived the alleged hit on his life but the second time round, he wouldn't be so lucky.

Michael 'Mullet Mick' Martin survived the alleged hit on his life but was killed two months later in a brutal attack at his home

The 46-year-old was murdered in a second attack, thought to involve an axe, in his modest flat in northern NSW last June.

He was killed on the night he arrived home after spending a lengthy stint in hospital recovering from the alleged bungled hit on his life in April.

Fallon was charged with attempted murder and assault occasioning grievous bodily harm on Tuesday.

Police have ruled out her involvement in Mr Martin's murder in the separate home invasion last June and have yet to make any arrest in the case.

On that occasion, Mr Martin was brutally assaulted and killed while his 25-year-old son, who was tied up and gagged, watched on helplessly.

An axe was found at the scene, a source confirmed.

Homicide and Tweed Heads detectives are still trying to piece together why there was a target on Mr Martin's head and are looking at any links between the April and June attacks.

Detectives say the 46-year-old had a 'colourful past'.

Locals knew Mr Martin as 'Mullet Mick', a jovial character who frequented Murwillumbah's pubs.

Fallon didn't appear in Parramatta Local Court on Tuesday and the case was adjourned until later in the week.

Homicide Squad Detective Inspector Grant Taylor said police were still keen for information about the other two people involved in the alleged home invasion in April, and any links the accused had with Mr Martin.
