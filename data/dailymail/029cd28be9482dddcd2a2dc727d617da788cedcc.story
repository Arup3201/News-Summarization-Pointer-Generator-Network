The number of mortgages being approved to home buyers is increasing as borrowers take advantage of the ultra-low rates on offer, according to a high street banking report.

Some 37,305 mortgages were approved for house purchase in February with a collective value of £6.2billion, marking a 2 per cent increase on the previous month, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said.

While the number of house purchase approvals is still 20 per cent lower than a year ago, early 2015 is seeing a higher demand for mortgages than the levels seen towards the end of last year, the BBA said.

Meanwhile, in further signs of growing consumer confidence, the annual growth in people's borrowing on personal loans, overdrafts and credit cards is continuing to increase at its fastest rate since 2008, at 4.4 per cent.

The BBA also said that deposit levels with high street banks saw slow growth in February, which could be partly due to the popularity of the Government's recently-launched, market-beating 'pensioner bonds'.

Richard Woolhouse, chief economist at the BBA, said: 'The increase in mortgage approvals is welcome news and a sign that the housing market is beginning to improve.

'We're seeing stronger demand for mortgages as consumers take advantage of some of the very competitive deals currently available.

'Demand for loans and other types of personal borrowing is rising at its fastest rate since the financial crisis. Consumers are feeling increasingly confident about buying big ticket items, such as cars or home improvements, as the recovery really begins to take hold.

The British Bankers' Association (BBA) have said the increase is 'welcome news'

'Personal deposits grew very slowly as alternative savings vehicles remain attractive, particularly the new pensioner bond.'

Lending to non-financial companies fell by £200million, with growth in manufacturing, transport, storage and communication offset by net repayments from the construction, accommodation and food services and the wholesale and retail sectors, the BBA said.

Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said: 'The recovery in mortgage lending reflects a very favourable economic backdrop.

'Mortgage rates are at record lows, and fewer households now expect a rise in rates within the next year. The reform to stamp duty has also increased most buyers' purchasing power. And that boost to affordability has been accompanied by further improvements in the labour market.

'Real earnings are finally rising, unemployment is falling, and the employment rate has reached record highs. That should all act to boost the mortgage market.'

Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the BBA's mortgage figures reinforce his belief 'that the housing market is now gradually turning around after weakening during much of 2014'.

Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said low mortgage rates are likely to be around for a while yet.

He said that with Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation at 0 per cent, a rise in the Bank of England base rate from its current 0.5 per cent level this year is 'highly unlikely and could even have been pushed back for 18 months to two years'.

Mr Harris said: ''The good news for borrowers is that rates are likely to be very competitive over (the) coming months.'
