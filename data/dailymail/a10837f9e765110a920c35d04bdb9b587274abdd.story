As winter storm Juno hits much of America's East Coast, one puppy is embracing the cold to learn about the ice and snow.

Quinn the Bernese mountain dog isn't afraid to slip up as she tries to run across an ice-covered hill.

And her owner takes the opportunity to film the pup's icy dash in super-slow motion as the pup slides down the New Hampshire road.

Once she hits the ice, Quinn quickly realizes that her body parts don't function the same way they do on dry land.

Shocked, the nearly five-month-old pup tries to regain balance but her limbs slide back and forth uncontrollably as she loses her footing. 

Quinn eventually gives up trying to stand on all fours and falls to her stomach, sliding down the ice towards the camera.

The video, which was posted on Instagram on Saturday, was shot by Quinn's owner TJ Parker at Loon Mountain in New Hampshire, according to ABC News.

Parker, of Somerville, Massachusetts, told ABC that the puppy went from 'freaking out in shock to pure bliss'.  

He has posted various videos to Instagram of Quinn playing, a number of which are in slow motion.

In one the shaggy pup can be seen heading down a playground slide, while in another she frolics through mounds of snow.
