A schoolboy was injured when a BlackBerry smartphone exploded and set the end of his bed alight while he slept.

Kian McCreath, 11, has been scarred after the handset blew up in the middle of the night, leaving melted plastic from its casing stuck to his leg.

Yesterday his parents branded the Curve 9320 handset ‘dangerous’ and called on BlackBerry maker Research In Motion to recall the model while an investigation takes place into what caused  the incident.

Dangerous phone: Kian McCreath, left with the twisted remains of the phone woke up screaming in a burning bed and was left with painful injuries, right

Frantic: Kian's terrified mother Sarah put out the flames, lifted her son out of the bed and put him in the bath

The Curve model is a budget smartphone
popular among teenagers who are drawn to the free BBM message service 
offered by BlackBerry.

It was bought for Kian’s brother, Mason, as a 13th birthday present a fortnight before the blaze at the family’s home.

The two siblings share a bedroom at 
the house in Holbrooks, Coventry, and the fully-charged phone exploded 
moments after their mother, Sarah, 39, had taken it off charge and 
placed it on Kian’s bed.

Mrs McCreath said she couldn’t sleep 
and spotted the phone on the landing at around 2.30am as she went 
downstairs for a drink. She added: ‘He’d set an alarm on the phone so I 
unplugged it and took it through to their bedroom.

‘I plonked it on Kian’s bed because his was nearest to the door.

‘I thought nothing of it, made a cup 
of tea then I heard a really loud pop sound. Kian started screaming at 
the top of his voice, shouting “my bed’s on fire!” His feet had pretty 
much been engulfed in flames.

'Dangerous': The boys' father wants to see every BlackBerry Curve 9320 recalled

Red raw: The 11-year-old had to be taken to hospital for treatment - and his parents say they are horrified at the thought of how much worse this could have been

‘I ran into the room and started 
battering the flames with his brother’s quilt to put them out. The bed 
was charred and the phone itself was just a blackened shell. My son 
could quite easily have died.’

Kian, who was treated at George Eliot 
Hospital in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, following the incident on November 
25, is now ‘wary’ of using his own Samsung phone, she added.

His father, Pete, 39, who bought the 
£99 handset as part of a £13-a-month contract, has held a video 
conference with executives from RIM, based in Canada, over the issue and
yesterday officials from the firm arrived at the family’s home to 
examine the handset.

Mr McCreath said: ‘I want them to be 
recalled. That handset is dangerous and it needs to be tested. A lot of 
the kids are raving about that BlackBerry phone right now.

‘My main concern is the safety of other kids.’

Concerning: Vodaphone have provided a replacement mobile and the manufacturers are 'investigating the matter'. The Blackberry burst into flames just minutes after being dropped on to Kian's bed

A spokesman for RIM said it was the 
first case of its kind that it was aware of, adding: 'RIM takes claims of this nature very seriously and a senior member of our team met with the family today to initiate a full investigation into this matter.

'In order to proceed with this investigation, we require the products that were involved in this incident to be made available for a full technical review.

'At this point in time, the family has not provided RIM with the battery or charger for analysis and have said they are unable to locate the device itself.

'We have a team on standby to conduct this investigation as a priority as soon as the family makes these products available to us.

'RIM is committed to ensuring our products are safe and we invest significantly in R&D and testing to ensure we meet or exceed all regulatory standards here in the UK and around the world.'

In August it was reported that the Curve 9320 had risen eight places to become the sixth most popular handset in the UK.
