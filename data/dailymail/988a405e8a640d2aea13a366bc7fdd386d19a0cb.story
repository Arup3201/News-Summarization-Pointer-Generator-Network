One of the eight people whose crack-related prison sentences based on mandatory minimums has been revealed to be the cousin of the Democratic governor of Massachusetts.

Governor Deval Patrick is a close ally of President Obama's but he said that he was not involved in the commutation application for Reynolds Allen Wintersmith Jr., his 39-year-old cousin who was sentenced to life in prison for possession and intent to distribute.

'There’s a significant age gap between the two, and the governor has no recollection of having met Mr. Wintersmith,' spokeswoman Jesse Mermell said of the 59-year-old governor.

Connected: Deval Patrick has been a supporter of President Obama for years (seen together in 2009) and the Massachusetts governor was an Obama surrogate on both campaigns

'Governor Patrick had no involvement in any application for a commutation of Mr Wintersmith,' she told The Boston Globe.

Mr Patrick is close with the President and was one of the top contenders to be Mr Obama's attorney general but Eric Holder was chosen instead.

The two have spent time together on and off the campaign trail, as Mr Patrick was a surrogate for the President's re-election campaign and dined with the Obamas during their summer vacation in Martha's Vineyard this year.

The outgoing governor's spokeswoman said that while Mr Patrick was aware that his cousin was in a Rockford, Illinois prison, she said that he did not know the details of the case.

Wintersmith was originally sentenced in 1994 to life imprisonment with five years' supervised release and a $1,000 fine because of his conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute both cocaine and crack.

He will now be released on April 17, 2014.

In a statement published online following the commutation announcement, the president said that the eight men and women had been sent to jail because of an 'unfair system' and all had served at least 15 years in prison, many under mandatory minimums that required judges to impose long sentences even if they didn't think the time fit the crime.

'If they had been sentenced under the current law, many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society,' Obama said.

'Instead, because of a disparity in the 
law that is now recognized as unjust, they remain in prison, separated 
from their families and their communities, at a cost of millions of 
taxpayer dollars each year.'

Commuted sentences: President Barack Obama speaks to the media on Wednesday - on Thursday he announced that he was commuting the sentences of eight men and women convicted of crack cocaine offenses

The commutation is seen as an attempt
 to redress the glaring racial disparity between those serving sentences
 for crack possession and those jailed for carrying cocaine.

Crack
 cocaine offenses were treated more harshly under old laws than those 
involving the powder form of the drug and led to tens of thousands of 
black people serving long prison terms, while those caught with cocaine -
 who were more likely to be white - were handed lenient jail time.

Of
 the eight, some had been sentenced to life imprisonment for dealing 
crack cocaine at the age of only 17 because of harsher sentences created
 in the 1980s designed to fight what was seen as an epidemic of the 
highly addictive drug on the streets of America.

In the previous five years of his presidency, Obama had only commuted one drug sentence and pardoned 39 people.

The men and women will be released in the next 120 days and the lucky eight include several high profile inmates who have been at the forefront of campaigns to have their tough drug-conviction quashed.

Many of the eight, such as Clarence 
Aaron of Mobile, Alabama, who was 22 when he was sentenced to three life
 terms for a 1993 drug deal were young.

Civil
 rights groups have been fighting vociferously for Aaron and last year 
thr Justice Department's inspector general critcized the department's 
pardon office for mishandling his petition for clemency.

Margaret
 Love, a former pardon lawyer who used to work at the Justice Department
 who represents Aaron said that her client is 'very grateful' to the 
president.

'He was absolutely overcome,' said Love to the New York Times.

'Actually,
 I was, too. He was in tears. This has been a long haul for him, 20 
years. He just was speechless, and it’s very exciting.'

Another recipient of a commuted sentence from the president is Reynolds Wintersmith, of Rockford, Illinois.

He was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 for dealing crack at the age of 17 as was Stephanie George of Pensacola, Florida, who got a life in prison for hiding her boyfriend's stash of crack cocaine in 1997, aged just 27.

In both of these cases the judge who handed out the mandatory sentences called them unjust and said their hands were tied.

A pardon forgives a crime and wipes out the conviction, typically after the sentence has been served. A commutation leaves the conviction but ends the punishment.

Helen Gray (left) and Stephanie Yvette George (right) The White House said each of the eight people whose sentences were commuted was sentenced prior to the Fair Sentencing Act and that they would have received lesser sentences if convicted of the same crime today

Groups that advocate for prisoners 
have criticized Obama for being stingy with his power - George W. Bush 
granted 189 petitions for pardon and 11 for clemency, while Bill Clinton
 granted 396 for pardon and 61 for clemency.

The
 old sentencing guidelines subjected tens of thousands of blacks to long
 prison terms for crack cocaine convictions while giving far more 
lenient sentences to those caught with powder who were more likely to be
 white.

It was enacted in 1986 when crack cocaine use was rampant and considered a particularly violent drug.

Under
 that law, a person convicted of possessing five grams of crack cocaine 
got the same mandatory prison term as someone with 500 grams - 100 times
 - of powder cocaine.

The Fair Sentencing Act reduced the ratio to about 18-1 and eliminated a five-year mandatory minimum for first-time possession of crack.

This also comes at a time when draconian sentences are going out of fashion as the nation deals with having only five-percent of the world's population, but 25-percent of its prison inmates.

According to a release issued by the White House, the commutations were granted to:

Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, called on Obama do to more.

'Kudos to President Obama for commuting these eight people, but shame on the president for not commuting many more.

'With over 100,000 people still in federal prison on nonviolent drug charges, clearly thousands more are deserving of the same freedom,' he said.

White House officials say he doesn't believe that clemency can be a solution on a large scale, because it's such a time intensive process and there are thousands of federal inmates affected.

The Obama administration wants to make the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive, and the president called on Congress to act in the new year.

'Commuting the sentences of these eight Americans is an important step toward restoring fundamental ideals of justice and fairness,' Obama said.

'But it must not be the last. In the new year, lawmakers should act on the kinds of bipartisan sentencing reform measures already working their way through Congress.

'Together, we must ensure that our taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, and that our justice system keeps its basic promise of equal treatment for all.'

Clarence-Aaron: Obama said in a statement that the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act has begun to right to a decades-old injustice, but for thousands of inmates, it came too late

White House officials say Obama had only approved a single clemency petition among more than 8,000 received because it's the only one that had been given a positive recommendation by the Justice Department.

According to one senior Obama aide, the president expressed frustration that he wasn't receiving more positive recommendations.

So White House counselor Kathryn Ruemmler approached Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney early this year and asked them to take a hard look at the clemency petitions filed by convicts for any that might have merit, given the change in the drug sentencing law.

The Office of the Pardon Attorney responded this fall by presenting the White House with 21 recommendations for pardons and clemency.

Ruemmler oversaw an independent analysis and turned over detailed memos on the cases to the president, who signed off on them all, according to White House officials.

In August, Attorney General Eric Holder announced a major shift in federal sentencing policies, targeting long mandatory terms that he said have flooded the nation's prisons with low-level drug offenders and diverted crime-fighting dollars that could be far better spent.

As a first step, Holder has instructed federal prosecutors to stop charging many nonviolent drug defendants with offenses that carry mandatory minimum sentences.

His next step will be working with a bipartisan group in Congress to give judges greater discretion in sentencing.

@highlight

President Obama commuted the prison sentences of eight people on Thursday saying their crack cocaine offenses did not justify life sentences

@highlight

The eight have each served more than 15 years in prison

@highlight

One of those people was Reynolds Allen Wintersmith, the 39-year-old cousin of Massachusetts governor and Obama friend Deval Patrick

@highlight

Patrick, 59, said that he has never met his cousin and was not involved with the commutation

@highlight

Presidents typically use the end-of-year period to consider ways whether to grant requests for commutations or clemency from convicted offenders
