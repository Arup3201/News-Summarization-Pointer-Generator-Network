Dubonnet: The aperitif of choice for the Royals

It's not all shaking hands and cutting ribbons for the Queen.

The monarch is fond of a drink or two and, like her mother before her, she adores Dubonnet.

The fortified wine with herbs and quinine was invented in 1846, the result of a competition by the French Government to find a way of encouraging French Legionnaires to drink bitter quinine by disguising it in alcohol.

Meant as a punchy cure for malaria, it fast became the upper classes' aperitif of choice.

The Queen Mother drank it every day - mixed three parts Dubonnet, seven parts gin, with a twist of lemon - and was even known to take a small bottle with her on journeys, 'just in case.'

The Queen inherited her passion and enjoys a Dubonnet and gin every day before lunch, and reportedly one before bed too.

Candid photos of her 
taken in the grounds of Balmoral enjoying lunch al fresco reveal her little folly - a glass of deep orange 
Dubonnet and gin by her side.

But
times have changed since Queen Elizabeth was first charmed by Dubonnet.

The burgeoning popularity of wine and flavourless, easy-to-mix spirits 
like vodka have seen off traditional aperitifs, meaning the Monarch is 
in the minority when she sips on her daily Dubonnet.

Indeed, the drink had all but fallen off
the nation's bars for good - until now.

With the Jubilee fast approaching, our 
renewed passion for all things British is gaining pace by the minute.

Couple that with our revitalised affection for the Royals and the natural charm and value of all things with heritage, and it's easy to see why Dubonnet is making a 
comeback.

Just the one: The Queen enjoying a Dubonnet and gin in the grounds of Balmoral

'It's a celebration of all things British,' says Adam Davison, head barman of Kitchen Joel Antunes at Embassy Mayfair.

'It's really made a comeback for the Jubilee season. It's captured the attention of the next generation - I'm going to serve it this weekend at my sister Danielle's wedding. Like Aperol or a Negroni, it's the ideal aperitif.'

At Embassy Mayfair, Dubonnet is given an update with new bedfellows like Pimm's, rum or vodka, or with its old friend gin.

An intriguing ingredient, it gives classic cocktails oomph and modern mixes an air of accomplished elegance.

Just in time for the Jubilee, Adam has reinvented Dubonnet drinks - proving that the Queen, and her mother, have impeccable taste.

Make them yourself with the recipes below for a heady introduction to partying Buckingham Palace style, or head to Embassy Restaurant in Mayfair to see how the professionals do it.
