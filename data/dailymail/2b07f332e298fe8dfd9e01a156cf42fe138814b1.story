The 30-year-old Togo international is on around £140,000-a-week although that would not be an issue for PSG.

QPR and Stoke have also shown tentative interest but the finance of any deal is the main obstacle for them.

Tottenham and PSG have been in discussions over fringe players from both sides in recent weeks.

Stoke, meanwhile, have also shown an interest in Lee Chung-yong at Bolton who is recovering from a hairline fracture of his leg but should be fit in 10 days.

Fiorentina have also been credited with an interest as they look at alternatives to replace Chelsea target Juan Cuadrado.
