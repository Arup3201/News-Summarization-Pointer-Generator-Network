Ian Poulter was busy on the practice ground here at the DP World Tour Championship on Wednesday trying out a putting tip given to him by Australian legend Greg Norman.

The pair spoke on Tuesday night after Norman spotted something while watching Poulter throw away a golden opportunity to win the Turkish Airlines Open last week.

‘I really appreciate someone with the stature of Greg taking the time to try and help me, it is very good of him,’ said Poulter. 

Ian Poulter says he has spoken to Australian golfing hero Greg Norman about his putting game

‘Whether he’s right or not, I’ll let you know on Sunday night. The problem I’ve got is that I’ve been working very hard on my putting recently, and it is a fine line of whether you mess and try something else. But I’ve certainly taken on board what he said and I’ll review the footage myself and work on the putting green and see whether he was right or wrong.’

In some ways the conclusion to that tournament in Turkey summed up a disappointing year for Poulter. Six shots ahead at one stage, he had a 6ft putt on the home green to force a play-off with American Brooks Koepka but, wholly uncharacteristically, missed it.

On the positive side, it was his second high finish in a row at the end of a season featuring precious few such highlights. He can also take encouragement from a late-season change of equipment manufacturer from Cobra to Titleist clubs that has clearly gone off without a hitch.

Now, in his own words, he is ‘desperate to salvage something from 2014’ with a win in this big bucks season finale. ‘I’ve had some good finishes here and it is a course that I really like,’ said Poulter, who lost a play-off to Robert Karlsson here in 2010 and was pipped by another Swede, Henrik Stenson, last year.

Poulter has Stenson in his sights once more this year, albeit the stakes are much lower this time. Twelve months ago, the Race to Dubai was at stake and the close friends had a good-natured bet which involved the loser serving drinks to the winner.

This time the Race to Dubai has already been wrapped by Rory McIlroy, leaving Poulter to try to pip Stenson for second place, and a tidy bonus of £512,000.

‘There’s still a lot of money at stake, so it would certainly be nice to catch him’ said Poulter. ‘But there’s no bet this year. We’re not going for the whole shooting match, are we? That said, given the year I’ve had, it would be nice to move up that board and finish second. Two weeks ago I was 64th, so there’s clearly the chance to salvage something from 2014.’
