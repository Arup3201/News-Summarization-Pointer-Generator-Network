When Dominic Solanke sat down for breakfast on Tuesday, the teenager never imagined his morning would end training alongside England's best players.

This had been set to be a normal day for the 17-year-old, albeit with the added bonus of watching the senior team train with his England Under-18s team-mates.

Instead, they watched him as Solanke took to the field with the likes of Wayne Rooney and Raheem Sterling after collecting his England Youth Player of the Year award.

Under 18 star Solanke joined the senior squad for training at St George's Park on Tuesday

The Chelsea forward helped make up the numbers during training at St George's Park on a day that will live long in his memory.

'I got told just after breakfast that I might be getting called up to train with the first-team and I was just hoping that it would be a yes,' Solanke said.

'We were all going down as a squad to watch, then about half an hour before we were going to head over (Under-18s coach) Neil Dewsnip told me that I was going to be training and from then I was just buzzing and really looking forward to it.

'It was a crazy feeling, a mix of excitement and nerves. Obviously, it's all the best players in England so the level was going to be really high. It was a good stage to try and impress as well.'

Solanke has been a star for Chelsea's youth sides and made his full debut last October

Solanke made a good impression on his senior team-mates, just as he has done at Chelsea and at youth levels with his country.

Jose Mourinho handed the forward his first-team debut in a Champions League tie against Maribor last October, while he played a key role in England Under-17s' European Championship triumph.

'2014 was quite a successful year for me, especially with England and winning the European Championship,' Solanke said.

'We went there believing that we could win it, and we just took each game one-by-one.

'I managed to become joint-top scorer too, so it was a great year for me at international level.'
