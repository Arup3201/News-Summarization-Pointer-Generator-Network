They may not be the first images that come to mind when you think of the First World War.

But these pictures of women getting to work on the home front are just some of the extraordinary photos uncovered for a new exhibition about the war's impact the lives of ordinary people.

Alongside the more well-known scenes of soldiers living in the trenches are pictures of the wives and girlfriends they left behind, as they get to work doing jobs usually reserved for their husbands and boyfriends.

The exhibition shows photos of women getting used to working in factories in the North East, as well as learning new skills in agricultural colleges hastily set up to teach a new workforce how to farm.

Entire streets in Lancashire were emptied of their men as hundreds joined up to so-called 'pals' regiments made up of football clubs, factory workforces or social clubs.

As pictures show them marching through the streets, packing onto ships across the channel and preparing their trenches in France, space is also given the hard work put in by their other halves back in Britain.

Original posters from the time also give an insight into daily life in Britain. One tells women to pack their partners off to the front or risk 'prolonging the war'.

Another urges readers not to dress extravagantly in times of war, as it is 'worse than bad form, it's unpatriotic'.

Graham Boxer, director of Imperial War Museum North, said: ‘One hundred years on, the objects we display highlight the poignancy and courage of people who shaped and were shaped by this first global conflict.

'Even a century later there are stories untold, experiences undiscovered and tales that will surprise.’

Among the photos and posters are also poignant letters and notes written between families as they were torn apart by events in Europe.

One note, written by a Frank Middleton as he left his home in Eccles reads simply: 'Please don't weep'. Records show he was tragically killed the following year.

Another letter is written by William Anderson, from Liverpool, to his wife, who was at home with his baby daughter in 1916. After watching his friends die in battle, he asks whether he should desert, but records show he stayed and died the following year.

The exhibition also shows letters written between Ada and Rhoda McGuire, two sisters living in Liverpool, both in their early 30s, to their sister, Eva, who lived with her husband Ralph in Boston in the USA.

On 7 August 1914, Ada writes: 'The Stock Exchange here is closed and everything has risen in price…Thank God Ralph won’t have to go to the war. Arthur Brown has gone…Bob Harley and heaps of others.

'Sports have all had to be put off because the men are called away.'

Miss McGuire later tells how a half-German 
teacher in Liverpool was forced to resign, writing: 'There has been 
quite a sensation here at Somerville school.

'Miss
 Coates, the head teacher of the seniors, made some anti-British 
statements to the girls…Well, the mothers fairly mobbed her. She had to 
be guarded by policemen.'

She later writes: 'We are on rations here now. We manage to get enough 
to eat, however, though not too much. Meat and butter are the least 
plentiful. No sugar is served in the cafes – you must take your own.'

From Street To Trench: A World War That Shaped A Region, is at the Imperial War Museum North in Trafford Wharf Road, Manchester from April 5 until May 31.

It is the first exhibition by the Imperial War Museums to mark the centenary of the First World War and features more than 200 objects, photographs, letters, diaries, artworks, film clips and sound recordings from the conflict, many of which are on public display for the first time.
