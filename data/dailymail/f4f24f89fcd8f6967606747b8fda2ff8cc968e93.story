A student has revealed how her life has been made a living hell after she started self-harming - in her sleep.

Stephanie Walker, 20, developed the condition at the end of last year.

She continued to self-harm on a regular basis since then despite efforts made by her parents to protect her.

Doctors are baffled by her bizarre behaviour and she continues to self-harm up to five nights-a-week.

Stephanie Walker from Leeds said her bizarre behaviour began last year

She
has become so desperate to stop the night attacks Stephanie takes 
anti-depressants and sleeping pills before she goes to bed.

Stephanie,
who lives with her mother Lynn, 50, father Peter, 52, and brother Michael 21,
in Leeds, has never harmed herself while awake.

Stephanie, a performing arts student, said: 'I'd always been a happy-go-lucky girl.'

But one night the student said she woke up to find she had been self-harming.

'I was terrified and it triggered a wave of attacks.

'I went to the doctors where I was prescribed anti-depressants. It seemed odd - I wasn't depressed at all - but the medication worked and the harming stopped.

'But then, a few weeks later, my boyfriend, who had just proposed, told me he wanted to split up.

'I was devastated and the self-harming started again. I'd sleep-walk and self-harm every night.'

Dr Dev Banerjee, one of the UK's leading sleep physicians from Spire Parkway Hospital in Birmingham, said Stephanie's case was "uncommon".

He said: 'Sleepwalkers tend to undertake non-intelligent behaviour, such as simple walking, opening closing doors or even eating.

'Some receive injuries by falling down stairs, punching walls or bumping into things.

'However, it is uncommon to systematically self-harm, which makes this particular case quite unusual.

'It is very odd for someone to take a knife and meticulously cut themselves.

'Naturally if there is a strong history of sleepwalking as a child, then it is very possible that this person may be sleepwalking.

'However, other factors need to be taken into consideration such as depression and whether the self-harm is purposeful and intentional. But people do all sorts of strange things in their sleep.

'I once knew someone who always ate just one scoop of ice-cream when they slept and another who continually sparked up lighters.'

Her mother Lynn, a cleaner and father Peter, a bus driver, have tried to make the house as safe as possible for her but the behaviour still continues.

Stephanie sees a counsellor twice a week and next month will visit a sleep clinic in a bid to discover the cause of her nightly attacks.

Mother Lynn said: 'It is very worrying. Stephanie is a happy and bubbly person in the day but at night something takes over her.

'We hope her seeing a counsellor and going to the sleep clinic we will get to the root cause of her sleep disorder.

'Sometimes I get up in the night to check she's still in bed.'

Stephanie, who has been forced to take a year off college to cope with her self-harming, added: 'It is so scary.

'I just want to get back to normal.'

Stephanie hopes to get back to studying for a BTEC qualification in Performing Arts later this month.
