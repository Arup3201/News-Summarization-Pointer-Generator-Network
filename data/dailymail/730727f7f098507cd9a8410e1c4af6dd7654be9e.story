Fed up of your desk-bound 9-5 job? Wish you spent your days being pampered instead? Dream of being paid to travel across the globe living the life of luxury?

Your dream could well become a reality because one luxury website has posted a job application for a lucky individual to test the luxury life, which will involve sampling the finest products and experiences that the world is launching.

According to website VeryFirstTo, which is offering the position, the Living Luxury Executive will dine at the best new restaurants, lounge in the finest hotels, dress in stunning jewels, road test the most extravagant cars, face test the most indulgent cosmetics, and play with the most sophisticated tech products.

The Living Luxury Executive will be responsible for evaluating each experience and reporting back to VeryFirstTo, a members-only luxury gift website that sells the world's finest products and dubs itself 'the first website for individuals to learn about, and have, newly launching luxury products and experiences.'

Newly launching brands that appear on 
VeryFirstTo and are candidates for testing include: Alexander McQueen, Apple, Bentley, Cartier, Christian 
Louboutin, Jimmy Choo, fine Japanese eatery Nobu and the renowned Shangri-La hotel.

Speaking about the ideal candidate, the recruiter said: 'The ideal candidate would be an early adopter, discerning, eloquent, familiar with fashion, hospitality, cuisine and technology, and have experience of the luxury market.'

Candidates must be able to 'distinguish between the roar of a Bentley and a Lexus engine, and the 
touch of cashmere and vicuña', according to the job spec.

A spokesman for the website told the Guardian: 'We will definitely be appointing someone. It is not a stunt. As for the salary, it is negotiable and we have not set it. There will be an ongoing contract and, depending upon the salary asked for, it can be anything from four days a week to less.'

But if you're thinking of applying via the website before Friday's deadline, competition is fierce.

Despite the position never being actually advertised (information was emailed to the site's members and posted on its site), word spread across the globe and within days 1,000 applications have been received.

Individuals have applied from a whole array of backgrounds and include a titled Lady, butler, Royal Marines Commando, Chairman of large European advertising agency, luxury magazine editor, beauty queen, senior politician and an Earl.

Besides a multitude of approaches from UK residents, VeryFirstTo has been overwhelmed by applicants around the world with many offering to relocate and others stating they would even do the job for free.

And it seems that candidates are confident in their abilities with sentiments expressed alongside applications including: 'I live in a large country estate and have an offshore trust, importing prime USDA beef from America and unpasteurised beer from Germany. I've owned and flown private jets and helicopters and stayed in top hotels.

Another applicant claimed: 'We were millionaires when we used to be in our country Iran until my dad became bankrupt and we had to flee.'

Another bragged: 'My whole being is surrounded in luxury. It's the background I require, the only climate I can breathe in.'

The site wants its employee to test out luxury items that it will then sell, like this £4,500 24-carat gold egg with vodka once 
enjoyed by 19th Century St Petersburg aristocracy inside

One man tried his luck with: 'My girlfriend of 2 years left me for another guy, now I want to make her jealous.'

Speaking about the much coveted role, a spokesman for the site said: 'I think It is abundantly clear that living the luxury life, especially when paid to do so, is irresistible to many from every spectrum of background and nationality.

'Luxury might only be accessible to the privileged few, but it seduces so many. Who knows, we might be able to provide someone with a very unexpected uber luxury lifestyle.'
