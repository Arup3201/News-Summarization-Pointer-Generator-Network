Covered in glitter under the glare of show lights, the Fama circus troupe perform to an audience of one in the middle of nowhere.

For these Chilean transgender performers, this is just another day in the office.

The vaudeville group, who market themselves as a circus, have been touring the country for 10 years performing musical numbers and dirty jokes.

Though audience numbers range from 0 to 400, the group puts on all the bells and whistles every night without fail.

Another day in the office: Dulce Lafferti performs for an audience of one. The performers in Chile's transgender Fama Circus always act as if the stadium is full

Take a bow: Ten of the 15 members of Fama, a Chilean transgender circus, conclude their show of musical numbers, jokes and flame-throwing for their small audience

Rain or shine, summer or winter, the girls stick to their sparkling bikinis and worn-out stockings all year round.

To complete the line up, stiletto-clad Susan Brown eats flames as the main attraction.

The conventionally striped Big Top has been customised with stars, and they have set up colourful lights to swirl across the ceiling.

They pack and carry the tents 
and the wooden planks used for seating. Their 
tent, set up on the dirt, has a capacity for 400 people.

Mobile home: Sasha Star applies her make up in for her performance in the capital, Santiago. She earns around £75 a month but is happy for a protective home

Carnival: The lively show is one of many to pop up across South America as the transgender scene booms. Here drag queen Francoise jokes with the audience

Acts: Susan Brown spits flames as the show of musical numbers and double-entendre jokes crescendos. Shows like this have sparked a wave of LGBT tourism

It is a protective home for the 15 stars in a country which did not legalise gay sex until 1999 - in a predominantly catholic South America.

Brutal attacks on homosexuals still fill the headlines of Chile's newspaper - just last week a young man was beaten into a coma.

The transgender performers are often mocked and some of them have suffered violent attacks.

'The
verbal aggressions and attacks continue, even after the passing of the 
anti-discrimination law,' said Vero, 40, who is one of the founding 
members of the show.

Packed: Sometimes they have just one person in the stadium fit for 400. Tonight drag queen Susan's act is a hit with dozens of people gathered for the show

Make up: Warra Montano applies foundation. The show go on all year round, even in the harsh winter with performers wearing small bikinis and worn out stockings

They 
earn between £75 and £150 a month - well below Chile's monthly minimum 
wage of £240. But they say they don't mind the pay because they enjoy 
their job and have few expenses.

'It's the only work I have. Elsewhere they don't give me work because I am a homosexual,' said 34-year-old Sasha.

However, with the surgery industry booming and the gradual introduction of hate crime laws across the continent, Fama's troupers are slowly harbouring the confidence to express themselves publicly.

Work: Drag queen Lupita would not work in an office where she would have to dress as a man. The continent is becoming more LGBT-friendly but backlash remains

Movement: As hate crime laws are brought into the catholic country, the performers are slowly harbouring the confidence to express themselves publicly

On October 10, Argentina granted a six-year-old transgender girl a female ID card.

The nation, which has similar underground performance acts to Fama, is currently obsessing over top-ranking television show La Pelu (Hair Salon), which reeled in viewers with transvestite host Florencia de la V.

And, after legalising gay marriage in 2009 - three years ahead of the UK - a same-sex wedding fashion show is a cultural highlight of the year.

Transgender operations are also on the rise, as the lucrative plastic surgery industry casts their net wider.

Unlike in Britain, cosmetic surgery is available to people of all social and economic classes.

Fama: They call it a circus but it's more like a vaudeville show put on by transgenders and drag queens, who have been an act for over a decade

There is no stigma - it is viewed as an oppourtunity to fix unfortunate biological flaws. In Colombia and Brazil, universities run programmes to offer operations to the lowest on the economic spectrum.

As a result, acts like Fama are now spreading out of the metropolitan hubs such as Buenos Aires and into the rural towns.

It has sparked a wave of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) tourism in South America, as people from similarly hostile states in America or regions of Europe come to experience the groundbreaking transgender scene.
