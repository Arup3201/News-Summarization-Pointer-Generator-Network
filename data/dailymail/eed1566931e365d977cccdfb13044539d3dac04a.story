Former Co-operative Bank boss Paul Flowers will continue to live in his £300,000, four-bedroom home in Bradford free of charge after pleading guilty at Leeds Magistrates' Court to drugs possession

Disgraced former Co-Operative Bank 
boss Paul Flowers will continue to be paid £11,106 a year and live rent-free in his four-bedroom house despite pleading guilty to possessing class A drugs.

The
 63-year-old minister, dubbed the Crystal Methodist, remains 
indefinitely suspended from the Bradford South Methodist Circuit.

Yesterday,
he was fined £525 for two counts of possessing class A drugs -
 cocaine and methamphetamine - and one count of possessing class C drug 
ketamine.

However, the cleric has been allowed to return to the £300,000 home in Bradford bestowed to him by Methodist church leaders while they launch their own independent investigation.

Until the committee reaches a conclusion - which could take months - he will also hold on to half his annual salary.

In November The Mail on Sunday exposed Flowers as a recreational drug user and he was suspended by the Methodist Church and the Labour Party.

He had stepped down as the Co-op Bank's chairman six months earlier over concerns about expenses.

Appearing before Leeds Magistrates yesterday, Flowers spoke only to confirm his name and plead guilty to the charges before being fined.

After the case, a spokesman for the Methodist Church revealed it will now launch its own disciplinary investigation into Flowers' conduct.

The spokesman, who was unable to comment on the potential disciplinary action, said: 'It is a confidential process so that all involved can speak freely, and it is independent of the Church leadership.

Caught on camera: Methodist minister Paul Flowers was filmed counting money for drugs in November

'We cannot give a deadline by which this work will be completed, but we would expect it to be before the summer.'

In March, it emerged that Flowers had written to Church leaders seeking to retire from his ministerial post, but no decision on his future can be confirmed by the Ministerial Synod for West Yorkshire until the Methodist Conference in July.

Until then, he is entitled to live in his 'manse' - a house bestowed to serving ministers.

In court, prosecutor Claire Stevens 
outlined how Flowers was arrested after he was filmed handing over £300 
for the drugs in a car in Leeds in November, last year.

Ms
 Stevens said the footage showed the defendant counting out £300 in £20 
notes as he sat in the car, then handing it to another person in the 
vehicle.

The 
prosecutor told the District Judge that Flowers was a former chairman of the 
Co-op Bank, a Methodist minister a former borough councillor and 
chairman of governors at a primary school.

She said he was interviewed three times by police and he admitted to officers that it was him in the video.

Ms
 Stevens said: 'He said he had been a cocaine user for the past 18 
months. He cited stress and the care of his terminally ill mother as 
reasons for his drug use.

'As
 a former chairman of Lifeline, the national drugs charity, he said he 
was aware of the effects of cocaine and this was a drug used to keep 
himself going.'

She said another man Flowers thought was a friend "sold his story to the Mail on Sunday for greed'.

Paul Flowers leaves Leeds Magistrates Court in Leeds after pleading guilty to charges of drugs possession

He stepped down as Co-op Bank chairman in June last year after reported claims of illegal drug use

Flowers stood in front of the dock in court for the 10-minute hearing yesterday. The church will now launch its own investigation into his conduct, allowing his to keep his house and salary until it has reached a conclusion

The Mail on Sunday exposed him as a recreational drug user in November last year

The
 prosecutor said no drugs were found in Flowers' possession by 
investigating police, and he was prosecuted on the basis of admissions 
he made to officers.

Flowers refused to comment as he left court and fought his way through a mass of cameras with the help of two minders.

Richard
 Wright QC, defending, said his client had a current income of £510 a 
month through pensions but admitted he had also gained assets following 
the recent death of his mother.

Mr Wright did not disclose the value of these assets.

When Flowers arrived at court yesterdaywith four minders, but the doors had been locked, leaving him to stand on the street for five minutes surrounded by photographers and TV cameras.

He said: 'Don't ask me any questions because I won't give any answers.'

He 
repeated his description of the mass of reporters and photographers as 
'vultures' as he stood and endured a barrage of flash photography, 
eventually saying: 'Do you have enough now?'

Court staff opened the doors at 9am and let the let the pinstripe-suited clergyman into the building.

The
 Co-op confirmed last year that it was seeking to recover contractual 
payments totalling £31,000 made to Mr Flowers amid reports that he was 
also the subject of an inquiry into 'lavish' expense claims.

Paul Flowers was a minister for 40 years

Flowers
 was caught buying and using illegal drugs including crystal meth, crack
 cocaine and ketamine just days after he was grilled by MPs on the 
Treasury Select 
Committee over the bank's disastrous performance.

Last November The Mail on Sunday were handed a damning video showing Flowers, 63,  in his car discussing the 
cocaine and crystal meth he wants from a dealer in Leeds.

He then counts
 out £300 in £20 notes and sends a friend to make the deal.

The video and a series text
 messages were handed to newspaper by acquaintance Stuart 
Davies, who was 'disgusted by his hypocrisy'.

The
 text messages prove Rev Flowers was using hard drugs in the days 
surrounding his crucial testimony to the Treasury Committee on November 
6.

On the day after his appearance at the 
Commons, Flowers sent a text reading: 'I was "grilled" by the Treasury 
Select Committee yesterday and afterwards came to Manchester to get 
wasted with friends.'

Flowers, who is gay, also boasts of 
using illicit substances including ketamine, a powerful Class C 
tranquilliser nicknamed 'ket', along with cannabis and club drug GHB.

In
 one text, Flowers wrote how his plans for a party were 'turning into a 
two day, drug fuelled gay orgy!!!'

In another, he boasted of how he was 
'snorting some good stuff'.

That was sent on the day he was first 
scheduled to appear before the Commons committee, but the session ran 
out of time to hear him.

Stuart Davies, 26, first encountered 
the minister via the gay dating mobile phone app Grindr in early 
October.

The two men exchanged texts and met a few weeks later. Mr 
Davies, who admits having used drugs in the past, said he was shocked by
 the scale of Flowers' drug taking as well as his double standards as he
 cavorted with two other young men.

'After
 hearing him bragging about his life, about his connections in 
Parliament, his 40 years in the church and his all-round good works, it 
just felt wrong,' said Mr Davies. 'He seemed to be  using his status to 
get young men off their heads for sex.'

Mr Davies decided to expose Flowers and recorded part of a trip they took with a third man, who we will call X, to Leeds to buy drugs.

In time-marked footage, Flowers says after handing over the £300: 'What else have we got to get?'

X replies: 'No, that's it'.

Flowers: 'Ket? No?'

X says he doesn't think he can get it and Flowers replies: 'Don't worry. We will cope with what we've got.'

Mr
 Davie said drugs first came up in an chat on 
Grindr after their first meeting.

He said Rev Flowers asked if he had 
used cocaine. 'I'd had the odd line and that's what I told him,' he 
said.

The video and a series of damning text messages were handed to The Mail on Sunday by acquaintance Stuart Davies, who was 'disgusted by his hypocrisy'

Some weeks later – on October 29, the 
date of Flowers' aborted appearance at the Commons – he sent Mr Davies a
 message saying he was, 'snorting some good stuff' and the next day 
invited Mr Davies to a party at his house.

Shortly before he picked Mr 
Davies up, Flowers sent a text saying: 'Have 2 bags of Charlie [cocaine]
 here and have ordered another 5... enough? P x'

One minute later he adds: 'Also have ket and G [GHB] because they [two other party guests 'A' and 'B'] apparently like them...!'

Mr
 Davies recalled that at the party: 'He produced a metal tray which had 
cocaine on one side and ketamine on the other. About an hour after we 
got there, another man came round with five more grams of coke.

 text messages prove Rev Flowers was using hard drugs in the days 
surrounding his crucial testimony to the Treasury Committee on November 6

'Paul was lining up big fat lines of the 
stuff. A was also having the GHB as was Paul but both he and B were 
mostly interested in the ketamine but also some of everything else 
besides. When we weren't doing that we were smoking joints.

'Paul was really holding court and telling us what he had been up to.'

He
 had been at the Commons the previous day for his aborted meeting and Mr
 Davies said: 'He took great delight in telling us how he had put one 
over on them – “Tory c****” he called them – because they'd wanted him 
back the next day but he had told them where to go.

'We
 asked him about how he kept his drug taking secret and he laughed and 
said that a Labour MP had passed him in the corridors and said, “Have 
you got a touch of the old Colombian flu?” He laughed.

'He also told us he knew Tony Blair, especially back in 1997. He just seemed to know everybody.'
