A Texas mother claims she was hospitalized Saturday after finding a rancid mystery object inside a can of V8 Fusion that smelled and tasted ‘horrible.’

Crystal Rodriguez, 27, of Mercedes, says the smell and taste of the juice became unbearable, causing her to empty it and cut open the can to see what was rattling inside when she shook it – she found a shriveled up mystery object.

Rodriguez told KGBT she became so sick the next day she had to go to a local hospital, doctors told her she was poisoned.

‘I opened it and when I took a drink out of it I spit it out because it tasted horrible,’ she told the station.

The Texas mother has a V8 Fusion every single night, so do her children, but this is the first time she has had any issue with her favorite drink.

The rancid smell and taste caused her to pour the juice out and what should have been an empty can rattled with a strange object when she shook it, she said.

The concerned woman cut the can open and made the startling find.

‘[It] looks like a pork, the skin pork’s, just nastier,’ she recalled. ‘The bottom of it had like black, it looks like it has little eyes and a little mouth.’

Rodriguez spent the night tossing and turning in bed with an increasingly upset stomach until the pain became too much to handle, the nausea overpowering.

‘I just feel nauseous and my stomach grumbling,’ she said. ‘I hadn't really been able to eat any breakfast or anything for the same reason that I just want to vomit.’

Doctors told her she had a bacterial infection in her stomach, said Rodriguez, and she blames the tainted V8. They were befuddled by what she found in the can.

Rodriguez said she contacted Campbell’s, the drink’s maker, and was told to mail in the bizarre find, and a Campbell's spokesperson told MailOnline a courier was dispatched to pick it up.

The spokesperson also said no other similar cases have been reported, and that no other sicknesses have been blamed on the juice.

The sickened woman doesn’t want anything from the company – not money or even a replacement for the drink. She just wants to know what was in her juice.

The Campbell's spokesperson said testing on the object will determine what action is taken next.
