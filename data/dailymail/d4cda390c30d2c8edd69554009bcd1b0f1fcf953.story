A drug addict who battered her war hero neighbour to death so she could profit from his will was jailed for life yesterday.

Charlotte Frazier-Doody beat 92-year-old William Davis around the head with what is believed to have been a saucepan after tricking her way into his home by bringing him a meal.

Mr Davis, who won nine medals for his Royal Navy service in the Second World War, was found alive by neighbours in his bloodstained terraced home.

Jailed for life: Charlotte Frazier-Doody (right) was today given a life sentence the brutal beating death of William Davis (pictured left during his days in the navy), who was found in his house, lying in a pool of blood

Despite horrific injuries, he managed to survive for another three hours before dying in hospital.

The court was told Frazier-Doody, 36, 
who lived opposite and claimed to look out for the widower, continued to
attack him as he lay on the floor.

The heroin user had been heard boasting about how she would benefit from Mr Davis’s will.

‘The only conceivable explanation for 
the violence is that she wanted money and that led to violence,’ said 
Peter Grieves-Smith, prosecuting.

‘If there be another explanation we 
haven’t heard it, and in our submission it is a safe and sound inference
from all the evidence.

‘Violence against a man she knew to be
elderly and physically frail, violence in his own home. He was attacked
in his back room. Experts believe the blows were delivered when he was 
lying on the ground, defenceless.’

'Defenceless': A police tent set up at the murder scene in April this year in which Frazier-Doody had attacked him as he lay 'defenceless' on the floor of his home, the court heard

Frazier-Doody had denied murder but 
yesterday a jury of three men and nine women took five hours to return a
unanimous guilty verdict at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

Judge John Warner ordered her to serve a minimum of 20 years behind bars.

‘Only two people know the true 
circumstances of what happened on that day and why he came to be 
murdered and one of them is no longer with us,’ he told Frazier-Doody.

‘In what should have been the safety 
and security of his own home, he was savagely beaten to death by you, 
one of his neighbours, and that involved the use of some kind of 
substantial object.

‘He suffered many blows to his head 
and it is clear that he was either attacked when on the floor or the 
attack continued when he fell on the floor.

Her DNA: Police forensics search for evidence. A clump of hair, which appeared to have been ripped out from the roots, found at the murder scene matched Frazier-Doody's DNA

‘He also clearly tried to protect 
himself judging by the injuries to his arms and forearms. He was 
obviously desperately grabbing your hair and he pulled out a clump of 
it.

‘But clearly he was no match for you 
and whatever weapon you were using. The motive for this frenzied attack 
remains a mystery and will continue to be so unless you decide to say at
some stage what actually happened and why.’

Caught on camera: Frazier-Doody was seen on CCTV driving her moped towards Mr Davis's house shortly before the murder

Mr Grieves-Smith told the court the veteran’s family were still mourning the loss of a ‘proud and independent man’.

In a bid to cover up her crime on 
April 1, Frazier-Doody tried to get rid of her bloodied clothes by 
dumping them in a friend’s rubbish bin.

The court heard the clump of her hair was found in the room next to Mr Davis’s body.

DNA taken from splatters of blood on 
the kitchen sink also matched hers and specks of his blood was found on 
her jeans and her moped when she was arrested two days later.

The jury was told that the back room of Mr Davis’s semi-detached home in Willenhall, West Midlands, was covered in blood.

Mr Grieves-Smith said CCTV cameras caught Frazier-Doody driving her moped towards the house shortly before the murder.

Nothing except a set of saucepans was missing from his home and his wallet – containing £280 – was still in his pocket.

Mr Davis, who had two children, four 
grandchildren and one great grandchild, worked as a locksmith after 
leaving the Navy where he had  served in Japan, Malta and Dunkirk. His 
wife, Clara, died in 2006.

Speaking after the case, Martin 
Lindop, of West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘William Davis
was a war veteran who had served his country with great courage and 
pride.

‘He was extremely independent, but his
neighbours would always assist him when he needed any help. To this 
extent, he trusted those around him.’

He added: ‘We do not know what motivated Charlotte Frazier-Doody to kill Mr Davis.

‘She was addicted to heroin and crack cocaine. However, she has never told the truth about what happened.’
