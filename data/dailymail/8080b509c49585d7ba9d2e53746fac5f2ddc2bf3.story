She may have no qualms about opting for the skimpiest of outfits to show off her enviable figure on Strictly Come Dancing, but Abbey Clancy says she's 'horrendously unfit'.

'I don’t train or go to the gym,' says the super svelte model, 27, who stars in the 11th series of the dancing show.

'I’m strong but I’ve got no stamina. I get out of breath so easily. That’s one of the things I’m 
looking forward to the most about Strictly. I’m most looking 
forward to just getting my fitness up, toning up and feeling good.'

Impressive: Making sure to show off her tiny 
model figure, Abbey opted for the most daring outfit of the night in a 
thigh-skimming pink number with cut-out detail as she took to the 
dancefloor with partner Aljaz Skorjanec

Bruno Tonioli and Len Goodman sung her praises last night after a raunchy performance, saying she was indeed a 'good dancer'.

But the size 6 lingerie and catwalk model claims that one of the pivotal reasons she signed
up to the BBC One show was to get in 
shape, in an interview with the Express.

Abbey also dismisses any suggestion that, as a model, she doesn't eat properly. And she says she's been tucking into extra portions to keep her energy up for strenuous routines and rehearsals.

'I’ve been trying to eat a lot more over the past few weeks. I mean I eat a lot anyway,' she says.

'There’s some myth that I starve myself, but I really don’t. I eat what I want and I’ve got a very healthy appetite.'

'But with all the training you do for Strictly, you’re naturally more hungry. Everyone is constantly eating on the show because you just burn so much energy dancing and practicing your routines. You need to eat well otherwise you can’t function and you get too tired and feel a bit sick.'

The thigh's the limit! Abbey Clancy ditched the 
elegant ball dress she wore on last week's Strictly Come Dancing in 
favour of an eye wateringly skimpy pink minidress as she took to the 
stage on Saturday night's

The Liverpudlian wife of peter Crouch performed with her professional partner for the first time last weekend for this year’s Strictly along with 14 other celebrities. She looked the picture of elegance and grace as she took to the dancefloor.

But on Saturday night she well and truly sent pulses racing as she ramped up the sex factor on the show.

Casting aside the ladylike ensemble she wore for her ballroom routine, Abbey strutted her stuff in an eye wateringly skimpy minidress as she tried her hand at Latin. 

Making sure to show off her tiny model figure in a striking pink number, she opted for the most daring outfit of the night in a thigh-skimming frock with cut-out detail as she took to the dancefloor alongside partner Aljaž Skorjanec to perform a sassy cha cha.

And it would seem the Liverpudlian beauty found a particular fan in the form of judge Bruno Tonioli, who told her: 'Don't worry, there is plenty to fancy about Miss Clancy.

'The attitude, the sex kitten, the nonchalant Brigitte Bardot. You look fab! You did a tiny little stumble at the end but I tell you, so good.' 

Len Goodman added: 'I thought it was loud and proud, full of attitude and rhythm. You're a good dancer, Abbey, you are.'

Abbey seemed annoyed with herself over little mistakes, but scored a total of 30 points ranking her in fourth place.
