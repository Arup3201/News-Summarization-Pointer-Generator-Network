Brazil routed Japan in Singapore thanks to a quite magnificent individual performance from star striker and captain Neymar.

The forward bagged all four of their goals - including a perfect hat-trick - in a 4-0 victory and he was brilliant throughout.

For his first goal, Brazil's favourite son rounded the goalkeeper and slotted home, and then coolly passed one into the back of the net and completed his hat-trick with a rebound before heading in his fourth and final strike with just nine minutes remaining.

Well that's all from me folks - but thanks for tuning in!

CLICK HERE to read our match report on Neymar's brilliance.

Words cannot actually describe how brilliant that performance was.

Brazil were good in patches, but Neymar was just sensational.

He contributes so much more than just his goals - and he managed to get four of those!

Neymar scores all four of Brazil's goals - including a perfect hat-trick - in a thumping victory.

A quite phenomenal display from the 22-year-old.

He now has 40 international goals in just 58 games.

Incredible, quite incredible.

Brazil have been brilliant but Japan are still going and Muto bursts clear to force a corner.

They cross the ball in but yet again it comes to nothing.

Some people questioned him for Barca last season, but Neymar has proven on the international scene he is absolutely world class.

Japan test Jefferson in the final moments, however, as Tanaka puts in a wicked cross and Okazaki nods it goalwards but it is tipped over.

Japan are attacking and trying to find a consolation but the Brazilians are holding firm.

To be fair, Gil and Miranda have been quietly impressive at the back as their captain has run Japan ragged up front.

Brazil's countering has been phenomenal - as has Neymar.

Kaka is reborn and he puts a wonderful cross with his left-foot and Neymar is at the back post to head past the helpless Kawashima.

Wow - he is something special is Neymar.

That's his hat-trick.

Another blistering counter see Neymar cross the ball in and Kaka nod a header on to the bar.

Coutinho then smashes a shot back in which the goalkeeper can only parry and Neymar is on hand to sweep it home.

Robinho, Countinho, Neymar and Ribeiro are just dominating possession.

They are more than happy just to pass the ball around and make the Japanese work to get it back.

When they break, it is electric.

Neymar uses his dazzling skills to bamboozle the Japanese defence before laying off Robinho, who slams a shot wide from the left-hand area of the box.

He should do better.

The second-half has seen Japan fade and they just cannot find a final ball into the box.

The threat of Kobayashi has vanished and it looks like no way back for them at the moment.

For a second Neymar thinks he is in behind again and in with a chance of getting his hat-trick after Filipe Luis smashes a free-kick forward.

However, a late flag denies him the opportunity to bag a third.

Japan are attacking well in spells but they cannot get the final pass away and Brazil are counter-attacking with serious pace.

Countinho sprints with the ball, eventually it gets to Neymar and he plays it back to the Liverpool midfielder who curls his shot just wide of the far post.

A blistering counter-attack from Brazil sees Neymar get the ball in the box and he jinks back before unleashing a wonderful shot just past the post and into the side netting.

Ribeiro has been brilliant since he has come on.

Neymar crosses in a dangerous corner and Miranda is completely un-marked in the box.

He swivels on the ball and then smashes on straight at Kawashima who dives well to save it.

It is turning into a bit of a stroll in the park for Brazil now.

They are dominating possession and forcing Japan to commit fouls.

Neymar whips in a free-kick which is headed back across goal by Gil but eventually cleared.

Coutinho has barely been on the pitch for three minutes and he has provided a delightful assist.

A lovely left-footed outside-of-the-foot pass through the middle splits open the Japan defence and Neymar coolly slots it past the advancing goalkeeper.

Long way back now for Japan.

Both sides make subs.

Everton Ribiero ON, and Willian OFF for Brazil.

For Japan, Honda is ON.

Neymar's goal separates the sides at the break.

Japan enjoy the last attack of the half as they get forward and win a corner.

Shibasaki whips the ball in and a dangerous shot from Tanaka sees the ball put back in before Shiotani fires wide.

Oscar fires in a free-kick from halfway inside the Japan half.

The ball is flat and dips late, and Miranda is facing away from goal.

He gets his head on the ball though and it floats over the bar.

This has been a very interesting game so far.

For all of Brazil's stars, Japan have looked very dangerous when they have attacked.

Gil is struggling a little bit at the back for Brazil, and both Danilo and Luis Gustavo have been guilty of giving away unnecessary fouls.

Japan are looking to counter and it seems like that will be their best way of causing Brazil regular problems.

Sakai rushes down the right-hand side and whips a delicious cross into Kobayashi who gets in from of Danilo and glances a header past the far post.

Lovely move.

Neymar and Tardelli look very slick up front.

In the match against Argentina, Tardelli scored twice but did very little else - here he is proving to be a perfect foil for Neymar but his lay-offs and hold-up play.

Oscar is starting to look lively from midfield now too.

The free-kick to Japan came to nothing but they have another one out wide.

Tanaka fires a cross in and Tardelli can only half clear it before Shibasaku fires a poor shot over the bar from the edge of the area.

Brazil deserve to be ahead but they must be wary of the Japanese here - they have some exciting attacking playrs with Tanaka and Co.

The midfielder is causing all sorts of problems with his pace and trickery.

And Japan's pressure forces Luis Gustavo to foul Kobayashi.

Free-kick Japan in a dangerous position.

Despite Neymar's brilliance, Japan have been dangerous too.

And they almost net a wonderful goal through Kobayashi.

A swift attack down the left sees the ball whipped into the box and the forward lashes a left-foot half-volley just over from 18 yards.

He has started this game like a freight train and it really should be 2-0.

Neymar strides past the Japan defence and lashes a fierce shot from the left-hand side of the area but it goes harmlessly past the goal.

And Brazil after ahead - you guessed it, it's Neymar!

A wonderful ball through the middle from Tardelli sets Neymar free and he coolly rounds the keeper to sweep it home.

Brilliantly finished.

Neymar runs with the ball again towards the Japan defence and, just as he gets in the box, he cuts back and tries to round Morishige.

The defender is forced to drag him back and Brazil have a free-kick.

The free-kick smashes the woodwork! So unlucky from Neymar, whose 20-yard effort got up and down almost perfectly.

When he is at his best, there are few better players to watch on the ball than Neymar.

The Brazilian forward picks up the ball on halfway and runs at the Japanese defence before being nudged over in the box.

A bit soft so no penalty is awarded, which is the correct decision.

The Japanese striker has started off in a lively manner and he is causing Danilo quite a few problems.

Brazil are yet to really get into this game in the manner they would have liked.

It's been an exciting start to the game and both Japan and Brazil have had chances.

Neymar skipped past a few challenges early on and got close to the box but could not get his shot away.

At the other end, Luis Gustavo put in a wonderful tackle to deny Japan.

The excitement is building in Singapore as the teams take to the pitch for the national anthems.

Neymar is out on the field and has completed his warm-up ahead of captaining his side once again.

The Barcelona forward made some brilliant darting runs against Argentina and he will look to cause the Japanese defence all sorts of problems today.

Japan beat Jamaica 1-0 in their previous friendly and most of their European-based stars have been rested.

Seven of their starting line-up are based in Japan and Shinji Kagawa is among the big names to only make the bench.

AC Milan's Keisuke Honda and Inter Milan's Yuto Nagatomo also fail to making the starting XI.

BRAZIL XI: Jefferson, Danilo, Miranda, Gil, Filipe Luís, Luiz Gustavo, Elias, Willian, Oscar, Diego Tardelli, Neymar

Subs: Cabral, Grohe, David Luiz, Jesus, Gil, Dodo, Fernandes, Romulo, Souza, Everton Ribeiro, Kaka, Coutinho, Robinho

Neymar once again captains Brazil as they look to follow up their victory over Argentina by beating Japan in Singapore.

The Brazil forward is partnered by Diego Tardelli, who netted both goals in the victory over their South American rivals.

For Japan, however, Shinji Kagawa only finds himself on the bench.

JAPAN XI: Kawashima, Ota, Sakai, Shiotani, Morishige, Tanaka, Taguchi, Morioka, Shibasaki, Okazaki, Kobayashi

BRAZIL XI: Jefferson, Danilo, Miranda, Gil, Filipe Luís, Luiz Gustavo, Elias, Willian, Oscar, Diego Tardelli, Neymar
