A woman who was overcome by fumes at an industrial cellar died after losing her balance and falling into a giant vat of wine.

Wine specialist Nerea Perez was watching the fermenting process at the cellar in the Spanish village of Salas de los Barrios, in the north west of the country.

It has been reported that the 25-year-old was overcome by the fumes given off during the process causing her to lose her balance and fall into the vat.

Emergency services were then called to scene after receiving a call that about an incident at a warehouse.

However, when they reached the cellar, they were unable to save her as she became intoxicated by the gases and could only retrieve her body.

According to InfoBizero, her uncle Raul Perez, a well-known winemaker, found her body.

The emergency services also had to give assistance to members of Miss Perez's family, who were said to be overcome with grief after the incident.

Tributes have already been paid to Miss Perez, who was also the secretary of the Socialist Youth of Bierzo, in the town of Ponferrada, El Bierzo.

The incident happened at an industrial wine cellar in Salas de los Barrios, pictured, in north west Spain 

All campaigning by the group was suspended today as a mark of respect as people took to social media to speak of their shock.

Alvaro Gerarfo Courel, the district secretary of the party told the website: 'We regret the loss of a member of the Bierzo, a companion, which is made more painful by the circumstance and her youth.

'We will show deepest sympathy and send a big hug to her family, friends and the Socialist Youth of Bierzo.'
