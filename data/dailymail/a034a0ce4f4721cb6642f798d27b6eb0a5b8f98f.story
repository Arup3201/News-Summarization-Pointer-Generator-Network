Jodi Arias's legal bills have surpassed a staggering $2million - and are expected to only increase.

The costs, funded by Arizona taxpayers, are being used to pay for court-appointed attorneys, expert witnesses and other legal bodies, according to officials.

They are predicted to only rise as Arias awaits a second panel of jurors to decide her sentence.Â 

Expensive: Jodi Arias's legal bills have surpassed a staggering $2million - and are expected to only increase

In May, Arias was convicted of brutally stabbing and shooting to death her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander, who was found dead in a pool of 
blood in the shower of his home in Mesa, Arizona, in 2008.

However, the jury failed to reach a verdict on her sentence, according to USA Today.

Now, a retrial of the penalty phase, featuring a new panel of jurors, has been set for March 17 - with Arias facing either life in prison or the death penalty.

The former waitress has been held in a jail in Maricopa County since her conviction, while her legal bills have continued to mount.

So far, taxpayers have forked out almost $2.2million on the costs, county spokesman Cari Gerchick told The Associated Press.

However, county attorney Bill Montgomery has refused to disclose how much money has been spent on the high-profile case.

Guilty: Arias will either spend her life behind bars, or be eligible for release after 25 years

During the murder, Alexander suffered nearly 30 knife wounds to his body, was shot in the head and had his throat slit so deeply he was almost decapitated.

Arias initially denied any involvement - even calling Alexander in the days after the killing and leaving friendly messages on his voicemail.

But two years after her arrest, she eventually admitted to killing him - but said it was in self-defense.

She said she recalled Alexander attacking her in fury for dropping his camera after a day of sex at his home.

However, the jury found Arias guilty of first-degree murder - a verdict they delivered 
four months after the trial first began.

At the time, the case captured headlines across the world - garnering daily coverage from cable news networks, and spawning a virtual cottage industry for talk shows.

Arias even used her notoriety to sell artwork she made in jail.

However, for the retrial, the judge will be limiting media coverage in a bid to avoid the same publicity.

If the second panel of jurors fails to reach a unanimous decision, the death penalty will no longer be considered.

Instead, Arias will either spend her life behind bars, or be eligible for release after 25 years.
