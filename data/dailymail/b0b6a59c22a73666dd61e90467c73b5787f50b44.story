Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell arrives at Manchester Crown Court for the third day of his trial

The girl allegedly raped by Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell showed no signs of injury during physical examination, a medical expert said yesterday.

The girl claims she was raped at the age of six, nine and ten during years of abuse at the hands of the star.

But Louise O’Connor said her intimate examination of the alleged victim found no evidence of injury that could be directly attributed to a sexual assault or rape.

The doctor added: ‘Having no injuries certainly does not negate any of those allegations – a significant number of children and young people who make allegations of assault and come to us to be examined will not have any injuries.’

Le Vell denies 12 charges of rape, indecent assault and sexual  activity involving a minor.

The 48-year-old, who has played garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV1 soap opera for 30 years, was charged under his real name of Michael Turner.

The jury at Manchester Crown Court was told the physical examination took place two years after the last alleged sexual assault.

Dr O’Connor, a paediatric  consultant, examined the girl at the St Mary’s sexual assault  centre in the city after the alleged victim made the attack claims in October 2011.

She said the girl cooperated throughout the examination though was in discomfort during certain procedures.

Le Vell is accused of five counts of rape, three of indecent assault, two counts of sexual activity with a child and two of causing a child to engage in sexual activity. He denies all the charges

She said the girl suffered from a 
hereditary condition – lichen sclerosis – that could make the skin prone
to irritation and infection.

But Dr O’Connor said that during the 
examination she could find no clear evidence of physical injury that 
would support claims of sexual assault.

The court heard that the last alleged
sexual assault had occurred some two years earlier and any physical 
injury could have completely healed.

Dr O’Connor said quite serious injury
and laceration could have healed without leaving any  noticeable 
scarring on medical examination.

Earlier the jury was told Le Vell had repeatedly raped and sexually abused the girl from the age of six.

On one occasion he allegedly held her favourite teddy bear over her mouth to ensure she remained silent while he raped her.

The court was told the girl first 
said she had been raped after attending a motivational conference in 
London hosted by a woman  who had herself been raped as a young child.

The teenager had travelled to the 
self-help conference with her mother and the pair had attended workshops
and seminars separately.

But during a scheduled break in the day the girl broke the news to her mother and told her it had been going on for years.

Le Vell was in arrested in 2011 but 
the case was dropped only for him to be rearrested and charged in the 
light of fresh evidence last year.

He has been suspended from Coronation Street until the conclusion of the trial, which continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
