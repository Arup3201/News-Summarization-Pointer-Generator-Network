A photographer has created a wonderfully unique family album by recreating a series of portraits of seven different generations of her female relatives. 

Los Angeles-based Photoshop expert Christine McConnell used a series of detailed editing techniques in order to create perfect copies of the original images, which all feature members of her mother's family and were taken over a period of 200 years. 

The 33-year-old then displayed the two images alongside each other, so as to demonstrate her remarkable resemblance to each of the original subjects.

Kathryn, born 1957: Photographer Christine McConnell (R) captured a variety of fashion styles and beauty trends in each of the portraits, which were taken over a period of 200 years

Mildred, born 1928: The 33-year-old (R) used portraits of various women from her mother's side of the family

The portraits also offer a fascinating glimpse into the changing styles and fashions of each period; the earliest image, of a woman called Mary who was born in 1821, sees the subject wearing a very simple black dress, with her hair pulled back from her face. 

Fast forward to one of the more recent photos of Kathryn, born in 1957, and the glaring changes in style are easy to see. Gone are the drab and dowdy clothes of old and in their place, a vibrant and detailed red dress, big, bouncy hairstyle and over-the-top gold jewelry. 

The beauty trends for each era are also clearly visible, with Mildred, born in 1928, modeling a deep red lip and full hair, while Attie Mae , born 1898, opted for a much more subtle look, complete with softly styled hair. 

Eager to include herself in the line-up, Ms McConnell also included a single portrait of herself in the collection, dolled up in the style of her birth year, 1981.

And clearly unable to resist the chance to include a humorous element in the project, the last collection in the portrait sees Ms McConnell attempt to impersonate a horse called Flicka. 

The portrait, in which the photographer poses in a checked shirt, complete with straw in her mouth, is the final picture in the series, which has thus far proved incredibly popular with fans.

'Fantastic series! Proves you can actually replicate any era, or indeed creature,' Flickr user Iain S Wallace commented on the images. 

'This is a hoot! Love it. You come from a family of pretty women - and one mare,' Jill Farmer added. 

It is not the first time that Ms McConnell's unique editing skills have earned her praise.

In July, the photographer became an overnight social media sensation after posting a series of images on Instagram which combined traditional 1950s female stereotypes with classic cult horror movies.

At the time, she told Buzzfeed that her work was inspired by her love of the different time periods, and the unique cultural phenomenons from within each era.

'I’m very enamored with the style of the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s,' she said. 'But I love the goofy sense of comedy that came out of the 1980s. 

'So my work is kind of a pretty/spooky combination of those things.'
