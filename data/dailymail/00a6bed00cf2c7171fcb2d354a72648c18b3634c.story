Manchester United's defensive problems have worsened with news that the utility man Daley Blind could be sidelined for several weeks after being forced off against Latvia.

The Manchester United summer signing, who has been entrusted to screen his side's defence since sealing a move to Old Trafford, is an important player for Louis van Gaal's side due to his ability to fill in at centre back or left back.

Manchester United have had 39 injuries since Van Gaal took over the reins at the Premier League outfit in the summer.

He has been particularly short of defenders after losing Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra.

The Dutchman brought in Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo to fill the void left by the experienced trio but it has been costly injuries to the likes of Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans which have hampered Manchester United's hopes of challenging for the Premier League title.

Van Gaal has been forced into calling on the services of inexperienced defenders such as Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair in the absence of his first choice defenders.

The 63-year-old has also had to deploy the likes of Michael Carrick, Antonio Valencia and Blind out of position to fill in for his wounded stars.

Here's a timeline of Manchester United's defensive problems since March:

March 5: Inter Milan confirm they have agreed a deal to sign Serbia defender Nemanja Vidic from United. He leaves at the end of the 2013-14 season.

May 12: United confirm Rio Ferdinand, a key component of the Red Devils' back line for 12 years, will leave in the summer.

June 27: Left back Luke Shaw is signed for £27million plus add-ons.

Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra also moved on to pastures new at the end of last season

July 21: Patrice Evra also exits the club, joining Juventus, even though he signed a one-year contract extension at United in May.

July 29: United boss Louis van Gaal announces he has had to devise a special training programme for Shaw, whom he describes as 'not very fit'.

August 13: United confirm Shaw will miss first four weeks of the season with a hamstring injury.

August 20: Argentina defender Rojo, who played at full back for his country at the 2014 World Cup, moves to Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon.

August 24: Smalling suffers a groin injury in the 1-1 draw at Sunderland.

September 1: Blind, who can play in defence or in midfield, is signed on deadline day from Ajax. The window closes with United having spent around £150million on new players but no recognised central defender.

September 12: Versatile defender Phil Jones is ruled out for up to a month with a hamstring injury.

September 21: Defender Jonny Evans suffers a foot injury in a calamitous 5-3 defeat at Leicester, with Smalling replacing him as he made his own return from the groin problem sustained in August. Another defender, Tyler Blackett, is sent off and therefore suspended.

September 24: Smalling suffers a new injury - this time to his thigh - in training.

September 25: United manager Van Gaal confirms he is now down to just one fit centre-back - Rojo - for the game against West Ham.

September 27: Nineteen-year-old Paddy McNair is drafted in for a senior debut against the Hammers. He also features against Everton, Manchester City and Crystal Palace.

October 26: Van Gaal reveals Jones is suffering from shin splints which caused him to miss the 1-1 draw with Chelsea, in which Smalling made his return from injury. Jones also missed the Manchester derby.

November 2: Smalling sent off for two bookable offences against Manchester City, while Rojo suffers a suspected dislocated shoulder. Brazilian full back Rafael misses the match due to injury so winger Valencia is forced to fill in. United end the match with McNair and Carrick occupying the central defensive positions.

November 16: Blind suffers suspected torn knee ligaments while playing for Holland against Latvia. A scan will determine the extent of the problem - but Dutch manager Guus Hiddink suggests Blind could be facing up to six weeks of rehabilitation.
