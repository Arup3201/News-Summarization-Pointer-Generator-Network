Two college students who discovered that they have a common sperm donor father revealed today the moment they found out they are sisters.

Tulane freshmen Mikayla Stern-Ellis, 19, and fellow-Californian Emily Nappi, 18, discovered just weeks ago that they are related after a series of bizarre coincidences drew them together.

Both are delighted to have a new sister, saying they already love each other. However only one of them intends to seek out their sperm donor father.

The two girls, pictured as babies, have the same sperm donor father that was used by their parents in California almost two decades ago. A twist of fate brought them together at college in New Orleans

Mikayla first made contact with Emily last summer while searching for a possible roommate on Facebook. The girls had a lot in common but their paths never really crossed at the New Orleans school.

Mikayla told Matt Lauer on the Today show: 'We didn't know each other that well, we could be really compatible as friends but we were never in the right place at the right time but we've definitely got a lot closer recently.'

They figured out that they were conceived by a donation from an anonymous donor after Mikayla posted a Facebook message about her upbringing.

But neither thought much of it, even when they figured out that both of their donors were Colombian.

Mikayla said today: 'I thought ''Wouldn't it be funny if we were sisters?'''

Mikayla's lesbian mothers Heidi and Debra Stern-Ellis used an anonymous sperm donor to have their daughter two decades ago.

When the girls went home for winter break, Mikayla told her moms about her new friend with whom she had so much in common. They urged her to compare her donor identification number with Emily - and the incredible discovery was made.

Emily told Lauer: 'I panicked... I absolutely freaked out... I started running around the house screaming and telling everyone, calling everyone.'

Mikayla added: 'It was mind-blowing, I didn't know what to do.'

Following the life-changing realization, their bond has become much more intense.

Mikayla said: 'We see each other multiple times a day now. We're a lot closer.

'The first time we saw each other [since finding out], we didn't really know what to do. But we became best friends because that's what we would have done even if we weren't sisters.'

Emily added: 'There was a moment at dinner when I said ''I don't know your favorite color or anything about you''. We've been catching up.

'I already tell her I love her after two weeks.'

The girls said it was cool to get 
more family along with a new sister and the two sets of parents were 
already hanging out with each other.

The one thing that the girls differ on is their attitude to finding their sperm donor father.

Emily says that she has absolutely no interest in meeting him but would like to find out what he looks like.

But
 Mikayla said that said that since she was little, she has been curious 
about finding out more about him - but for now is happy with the sister 
she happened on by chance.

She said: 'Emily is much more than I could hope for.'

Chance meeting: The two met during their first year at Tulane University. They started talking the summer before freshman year while searching for roommates. Above, Mikayla and her mom Debra at the New Orleans campus
