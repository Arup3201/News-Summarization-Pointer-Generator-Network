Foreign marathoners who were hoping to join the ranks of the few who have competed in a race in North Korea’s capital have had their hopes dashed.

A number of travel agencies which operate tours to Pyongyang said they have been informed that North Korea has banned foreign runners - both amateur and professional - from participating in this year’s event due to Ebola fears within the secretive nation.

No Ebola cases have been reported in North Korea or anywhere near it, and its state media have suggested that the deadly virus was created by the US military as a biological weapon.

North Korea implemented some of the toughest Ebola-related travel restrictions in the world last October when it banned foreign tourists over fears that the virus could spread into the isolated country.

The annual Pyongyang marathon is a popular tourist event, with hundreds of foreign runners signing up for April’s race.

In a statement, Koryo Tours, a Beijing-based, British-run firm, said it was alerted by its North Korean partners.

It said: ‘We were told that this is due to the ongoing precautions that the country has put in place in relation to fears held there over the Ebola virus.

‘It is still unclear when the borders will be reopened, but we were also advised not to cancel our March tours, and to expect an update on the border situation at the end of February.’

The company had been selling tours, which included the marathon, for between £580 (approximately $900) and, £1,240 ($1,900).

Its co-founder, Nick Bonner, said he did not think the decision reflected any deeper problems in North Korea’s government, though the news comes amid reports leader Kim Jong-Un has called for increased combat readiness and, at a meeting of senior party and military leaders, described tensions on the peninsula as graver than ever before.

Bonner said more than 400 foreign runners had signed up with his agency to compete in what has been billed as one of the most exotic marathon locales on Earth.

He said it was his agency’s biggest group in 10 years and would have been one of the largest ever.

Despite the travel ban, the event, which reportedly had slots for 500 tourists, will go ahead as planned with local runners.

Mr Bonner’s company is also organising tours to a 10k run in Pyongyang in June and a half marathon in the Mount Paekdu area in August.

Another operator, Young Pioneer Tours, said on its website that it received the same notification, but it is expecting North Korea’s borders to reopen ‘very soon’.

The decision comes just a few months after North Korea released a propaganda-influenced advert, set to an accordion group’s cover of A-ha’s 1984 hit Take On Me, to recruit foreign runners.

Last year’s race was the first time foreign runners were allowed to compete in the event, known as the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon, but they were monitored by officials and placed under restrictions.

The 2014 half marathon was won by a Briton, Will Marks, who lives in Shanghai and was 30 when he claimed his victory with a time of one hour and 33 minutes.

In an interview last year, he told MailOnline: 'It was as surreal as you'd imagine. After I finished we had to stand around in the heat for hours then parade around in the middle of the pitch with the anthems playing, then the North Korea minister for sports and some podium girls gave me the medal and a big daisy.'

Runners were not allowed to carry their country’s flag, cameras or communication devices during the race, and they were barred from leaving their hotel to roam freely. 

Pyongyang's marathon is sanctioned as a bronze-level event by the International Association of Athletics Federations and has been held almost annually since 1981 in conjunction with the birthday of Kim Il-sung, North Korea’s founder and the grandfather of its current leader.

North Korea has cancelled another popular tourist event, the Arirang Mass Games, without citing a reason. It involves thousands of gymnasts, dancers and schoolchildren who perform choreographed routines.
