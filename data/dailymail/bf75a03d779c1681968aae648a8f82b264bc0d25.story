Ronan Farrow, the biological son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, distinguishing him as one of the country's brightest thinkers.

But given their estranged relationship, it is unlikely that Woody will be celebrating along with him.

Ronan, 23, and Woody, 75, had a very public falling out when Woody began a romantic relationship with Mia's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, 34 years his junior.

'He's my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression,' Ronan has said.

'I cannot see him. I cannot have a relationship with my father and be morally consistent... I lived with all these adopted children, so they are my family. To say Soon-Yi was not my sister is an insult to all adopted children,' Ronan said of the relationship.

Ronan has not seen much of Woody since his romantic relationship with Soon-Yi began in 1992 when Ronan was only five years old.

Following the discovery of naked photos of Soon-Yi in Woody's possession, Mia split from Woody and launched a messy custody battle over their three children.

During the proceedings, which were closely followed, Mia claimed that Woody had sexually abused Ronan's sister Dylan, though the judge dismissed the claims because they were not substantiated.

Mia was awarded full custody, and Woody was only allowed to have supervised visits with Ronan, originally named Satchel Ronan O'Sullivan Farrow.

Woody was denied visits with Dylan, who later changed her name to Malone, and the couple's other adopted child Moshe, who changed his name to Moses, chose not to see Woody at all.

In a PBS documentary titled American Masters, Woody is profiled in detail about his work and Soon-Yi is seen in clips. He never mentions Ronan in the entire three-and-a-half hour series, the second portion of which airs tonight.

In a 2005 interview, Woody confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children from his relationship with Mia.

'Well, I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair.

The strained relationship with his father doesn't seem to have held Ronan back, and he has been deemed a child prodigy.

He enrolled in Bard College at the age of 11, graduating at 15, and moving on to the prestigious Yale Law School and graduating by the age of 21- a year younger than most students finish their undergraduate degree.

Since leaving school, Ronan has worked as a special advisor to the State Department, specifically focusing on the youth issues in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He has lent his face and name to charitable causes for years, serving as a UNICEF spokesperson from 2001 to 2009.

After working under Hillary Clinton in the State Department, Ronan is now moves into the ranks of her husband, former president Bill Clinton, with Monday's Rhodes scholarship nomination.

This year, 32 Americans have been nominated for the scholarship that will pay for the expenses of a year of study at Oxford University.

For a man known for his many neuroses, Woody Allen hasn't let that stop him from enjoying his love life.

The famous New Yorker has been married three times, in addition to a number of multi-year relationships with actresses Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow.

Ronan is his only biological son, but he has four adopted children- two that he adopted with Mia and two with his current wife Soon-Yi.

He first married at age 19 to a 16-year-old girl named Harlene Rosen, and that marriage lasted for five years.

Undeterred, Woody married actress Louise Lasser, and though they divorced three years later, she continued to work with him and was featured in three films after they ended their romantic relationship.

The recent release of Diane Keaton's autobiography gives a glimpse into their partnership, and while it only lasted a year, their professional one lasted much longer with Ms Keaton serving as his muse for such films as Annie Hall.

'He was even better-looking in real life. He had a great body, and he was physically very graceful,' Keaton writes in her book.

Keaton was not his first relationship that played out on the big screen, as Woody was rumored to have dated a 17-year-old student Stacey Nelkin in the 1970s and she was said to be the inspiration for his 1979 film Manhattan.

Woody's relationship with Mia Farrow, which began in 1980, was quite the Hollywood pairing, ending in explosive Hollywood fashion. Mia had previously been married to Frank Sinatra and was nominated for a Golden Globe for her work in Rosemary's Baby, so she was famous in her own right when she and Woody started their relationship.

The couple never married but were together for 12 years. Mia had three biological children and three adopted children from a previous relationship, one of which was Soon-Yi Previn who Mia adopted from Korea at the age of 8 years old.

When she and Woody were together, the couple adopted two more children and she gave birth to their son Ronan.

In 1982, Mia found naked photos of Soon-Yi, who was 21 at the time, on Woody's mantelpiece.

This discovery prompted a torrid legal battle between Mia and Woody over the custody of their children. Woody was denied access to their daughter Dylan, allowed only supervised visits with Ronan, and their eldest son Moses was given the choice- and decided not to see his father.

In a 2005 interview, Woody confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children with from his relationship with Mia.

'Well, I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair.

In spite of the drama, Soon-Yi and Woody stayed together, eventually marrying in 1997. The couple have since adopted two children named Bechet and Manzie Tio, their names paying homage to two jazz musicians.

'The heart wants what it wants. There's no logic to those things,' Woody has said.
