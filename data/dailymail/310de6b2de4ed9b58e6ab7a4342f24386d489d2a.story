In the era of selfies, Instagram and over-sharing, new research has revealed that one in three Aussies have rejected a video call from loved ones because they didn't think they looked good enough. 

Research by the Belong Broadband group has found that almost 10 million Australians use video calling applications like Skype and Facetime to connect with friends and family both interstate and overseas.

But what actually has our attention during a video call and is the technology really making us vain?

The research found that a quarter of the 1000 people surveyed spend more than five minutes preparing themselves for a single call, while over 10 per cent take 15-30 minutes.

As every experienced selfies taker knows, there's a lot that goes into looking good on a screen.

Almost 40 per cent of people surveyed said they fix their hair before a video call while 30 per cent not only have a quick glance in a mirror but also check if their background is suitable. 

One in five people take it a step further by making sure the angle and lighting is flattering, while another handful admits they take a selfie to ensure they are screen ready.

A change of clothes just for a video chat is also not out of the question for 15 per cent of people, although one in 10 said it was only the top half of their outfit that concerned them.

On the contrary, one in three people admitted they had at one stage been forced to scramble to put anything on after receiving an unexpected video call.

But even after all the effort of ensuring a perfect appearance, a quarter of respondents admitted they are more focused on watching themselves in the preview screen than the person they are speaking to.

'The internet has made us all feel like we're minor celebs and video calling only adds to it – we never want to be caught off-guard, or in the situation where we choose to answer the call and someone uploads a screenshot to Facebook or Instagram,' Carli Alman,  make-up editor at beauty website beautyheaven.com.au told Belong.

'This research shows just how much effort we all actually put into looking 'effortlessly' chic for something as simple as a video call! Make-up and hair touch-ups used to happen before meeting a friend or going a date, so it's interesting to see how much our habits have changed.'
