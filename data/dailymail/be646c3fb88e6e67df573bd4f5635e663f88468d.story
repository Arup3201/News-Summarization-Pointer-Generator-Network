When Lisa Whaymand's life was saved by a bone marrow transplant, there was only one way she could thank her anonymous donor.

Not allowed to know anything about him other than his sex and age, she was limited to forwarding a simple card.

Until last year, that is. 

Remembering the selfless person who gave her the chance to see her children grow up, the 46-year-old mother of three answered an advert by cancer charity Anthony Nolan seeking to put survivors in touch with donors.

Kindness of strangers: Mother-of-three Lisa Whaymand with bone marrow donor Neil Munro

'There was no way I could have gone through life without finding him,' she said. 'It was always in the back of my mind. He saved my life.' 

The single mother was diagnosed in 2010, after suffering sore knees and chronic fatigue for several months. 

Blood tests revealed she had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia – which attacks white blood cells – and she was admitted to hospital.

Just days from death, Miss Whaymand began chemotherapy straight away. Then in November that year, her consultant suggested she have a bone marrow transplant.

The procedure had a 60 per cent chance of success – compared to just 40 per cent if she continued with chemotherapy.

She went ahead with the operation and quickly began to improve. 

After just a few months, Miss Whaymand was allowed back home to be with her children Jack, 12, Harry, 11, and Olivia, eight. But she never forgot that she owed her life to the generosity of a stranger.

And last summer, four years after the transplant, she and her family found themselves on donor Neil Munro's doorstep.

They had travelled from their home in Reading to find the 46-year-old in Aberdeen – with their meeting filmed for BBC series The Gift, which starts on Tuesday, February 10.

'It was a bit surreal,' Miss Whaymand said. 'I just grabbed him and gave him a massive bear hug.

'I said, 'You're amazing for what you've done, not just for me but for my family, my kids'.' She added that her son Jack waited until the cameras stopped rolling before shaking Mr Munro's hand. 'He said thank you for saving my mum. I was incredibly proud.'

Last night Mr Munro said the meeting was 'very poignant'.

He added: 'The actual marrow harvesting didn't look very nice, but I thought it was a small price to pay if it gave someone the chance to recover from leukaemia.'

The Whaymands now keep in regular contact with Mr Munro, his wife Louise and their children Tara, 14, Connor, 13, and Kirsten, 11.

'It's so lovely that something good has come out of this trauma,' Miss Whaymand said. 'We're in touch all the time. We couldn't be happier.'
