What do you get when you have arguably the world's greatest-ever player, playing the current No 1 football game on the planet?

Well in truth, not the spectacle that one would hope for.

Three-time World Cup winner Pele took on his former Santos and Brazil team-mate Coutinho at a game of FIFA 15 on an Xbox recently - in an affair that would likely feature last on Match of the Day if it was played out in reality.

The 70-somethings were visibly unfamiliar with the game or the console that they were playing on

Having forged a deadly partnership for Santos over a half century ago in December 1958 as teenagers, the pair failed to set their virtual game alight - with only one goal separating the two greats.

The match wasn't a tight affair though for it's skill, but more due to a lack of it as the two 70-somethings were unfamiliar with the game, or the console that they played it on, unsurprisingly.

Rather comically the pair seem confused as to what the controls were - but take it in all good heart as they laugh at their own misgivings.

And once more - like throughout his glittering career - Pele proved the matchwinner scoring the only goal to separate the two sides; as Santos faced Santos in a special clash that featured the duo featuring virtually with their team-mates from their formidable team in the 1950s and 60s.

Despite their struggles to get to grips with the game the pair were all smiles as they played FIFA 15

Ironically though, it was the real-life Pele who tasted some of his own goalscoring medicine for once, with Coutinho controlling his virtual version to score and win the game 1-0.

Seeing the iconic Brazil No 10 in a jovial manner though will please everyone in the football world after the 74-year-old recently was recently discharged from hospital on Tuesday.

Pele spent 16 days at the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo after being diagnosed with an urinary tract infection that stemmed from an operation to remove kidney stones but, having left semi-intensive care last weekend, he is now feeling 'recovered'.

Quoted in Brazilian newspaper O Globo, he told a press conference on Tuesday of his current well-being and his excitement towards the Rio 2016 Olympics.

'Thank God I'm well and recovered. I want to thank everyone who sent messages - I've been thrilled and surprised.

'I've had messages from China, Pakistan, from almost all the European countries.

'It is gratifying and good to know that I had the support of so many people around the world who were hoping the situation improved.

'Now I am preparing for the Olympics!'
