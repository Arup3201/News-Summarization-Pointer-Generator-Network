Mix-up: Christine Greenslade, 66, realised her old classmates believed she was dead

Friends of Christine Greenslade were shocked to read news of her untimely death at the age of just 34.

So they were even more shocked when she got in touch three decades later – to organise a reunion.

Mrs Greenslade was very much alive – and oblivious to the fact that a local newspaper had mistakenly announced her death in 1980.

In fact it was her mother Pamela who had passed away, but when Christine arranged for the death notice to be published the women’s names were switched.

Mrs Greenslade was completely unaware of the error and moved abroad, oblivious to the fact that her schoolfriends in Penzance, Cornwall were grieving.

The mistake only came to light when she called her old chums to organise a get-together.

Now a 66-year-old artist living in France, she was preparing to revisit her childhood home and contacted friends from St Gertrude’s Convent.

She explained: ‘I got in touch with Viv Albright and she sounded very odd. It wasn’t quite the reception I was expecting from an old friend.

‘She rang me back and said “I’m terribly sorry, but we all thought you were dead”.

‘Looking back I was in a bit of a state when I rang the newspaper because I’d just lost my mum.

‘But I can remember the man specifically asking for mother’s name at the start of the call, and then asking for mine at the end.

‘At the time I was Christine Downing and she was a Greenslade – so it seemed impossible to mix up the two names.

‘But there it was “Christine 
Greenslade has died, leaving three children and a husband”.’ Mrs 
Greenslade is due to travel to Penzance from her home in western France 
next week.

The separated mother of two said 
yesterday: ‘It’s very sad to think that they mourned me all those years 
but at least I’ve got plenty to tell them.

‘This whole experience has made me 
realise just how lucky I have been to be alive all these years and to 
have crammed so much into my life.’

Another of Mrs Greenslade’s friends, Jane Johnson, 66, said: ‘In 1980 Viv told me there was a report in the newspaper.

‘It said that Chris was dead which was absolutely awful. Then I got this call saying she was alive. I could barely believe it.

‘To see her after all those years, 
when I thought that she was dead and I had been mourning her, it is just
amazing.’ She added: ‘I had always thought of her, particularly on her 
birthday, and I have missed her terribly.

‘To lose all those years is awful but now we’re going to try to make up for lost time.’

The bungled obituary appeared in The Cornishman, a Penzance-based newspaper which has been printed once a week since 1878.

Yesterday the acting editor Richard 
Whitehouse said: ‘It’s always unfortunate when any mix-ups occur in a 
newspaper. And it is especially unfortunate when a mix-up remains 
unresolved for so long.

‘But The Cornishman is pleased that it has been able to announce to the world that Christine is alive and kicking.

‘Hopefully she can enjoy reacquainting herself with friends who thought she was no longer alive.’
