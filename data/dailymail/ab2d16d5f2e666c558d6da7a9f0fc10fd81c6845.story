The baby girl who was delivered by emergency C-section after her mother was fatally struck by a car has died, officials said today.

The baby, whom postdoctoral instructor Jennifer Young and husband Gavan Young had named Samantha, succumbed to her injuries a day after her mother was killed.

Mrs Young, of Rice University, was struck Tuesday while walking near the Houston, Texas campus; the baby was reported alive but in critical condition.

Tragedy: Jennifer J. Young, a postdoctoral instructor at Rice University, was struck and killed at an intersection with her seven-month-old baby succumbing to the injuries on Wednesday

Scene: She was hit by a grey Acura as she tried to cross near Main and Cambridge streets

Expecting: Her baby who was delivered by an emergency C-section would have been her and her husband's first

Samantha Young would have been the couple's first child, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Mrs Young, a mathematics instructor, was seven months pregnant when crossing near the intersection of Main St and Cambridge around 9:20am, the paper said.

Her baby was delivered by emergency C-section at Memorial Hermann hospital, where the mother was later pronounced dead.

She was reportedly struck by a grey Acura MDX that was driving down Main, though police said the vehicle had a green light.

Houston police said the car next to the Acura stopped in the intersection, but the Acura continued on, striking the young woman.

They held the driver of the Acura for questioning, but they were later released.

The investigation for the case is on-going. 

Mrs Young was a bright postdoctoral student teaching at the Computational and Applied Mathematics department at Rice University.

'It seemed like the stars were perfectly aligned for her,' Rice professor Steve Cox told Chron.com.

Mr Cox was the principal investigator
on the grant that brought Ms Young to the university's Computational 
and Applied Mathematics Department almost two years ago.

Mr Cox said Mrs Young's grant application stood out, particularly because of her extraordinary teaching and mentoring experience. 'It's just tragic,' he said.

Urgent care: She was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital, where she died hours after the emergency delivery

The professor's husband, Gavan Young, was too grief-stricken to speak to the press on Wednesday, according to the news website.

Instructors who worked with Mrs Young remembered her as hard-working. ‘Jennifer was a true collaborator and a key partner in establishing a working collaboration with scientists at the Texas Medical Centre,’ Computational and Applied Mathematics Chair Matthias Heinkenschoss told KVUE via email.

In September, Mrs Young was to begin the last year of a prestigious fellowship at Rice University after completing her doctorate in applied mathematics.

She would have been a fully-fledged professor in about a year, having recently accepted a tenure-track position at another university.

In a letter to faculty, staff and students, the university's chairman of computational and applied mathematics Matthias Heinkenschloss announced Mrs Young's death, describing her as talented and accomplished with a bright future.

Higher education: Ms Young taught at the Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics at Rice University

Mrs Young arrived at Rice in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Delaware and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The academic continued that work at Rice, teaching and participating in mathematics outreach programs with high school students.

The bond Mrs Young had built with her students brought her some of the best teaching evaluations in the department's history, Mr Heinkenschloss said in the note.

Mrs Young, who specialized in mathematical biology, also participated in research. She spent significant time establishing a working collaboration with scientists at the Texas Medical Center, where she probably had been the morning of the crash, Mr Cox said.

He called her 'a natural academic' and recalled how excited she was when she told him she was pregnant.

'She had this love and belief that one could do it all,' Mr Cox said. 'With no complaints.'
