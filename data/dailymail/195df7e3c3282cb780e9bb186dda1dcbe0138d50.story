Christina Fonthes, 27, from Manchester, was in the Democratic Republic of Congo with her mother and younger sister when her passport was taken away

A British woman was held captive in the Democratic Republic of Congo 'because her family want to cure her gayness', her friends have claimed.

Christina Fonthes, 27, from Manchester travelled to the country's capital, Kinshasa, to visit her aunt with her mother and younger sister.

But it is believed that shortly after arriving, the LGBT activist's mother took her passport away so her sexuality could be 'fixed'. 

In a tweet posted on Thursday, Miss Fonthes said: 'Pls tell @UKinDRC & @ukhomeoffice that Im  NOT missing. My passport has been stolen BY MUM. and I need to return to uk asap.'

Her partner of three years, BBC sports presenter Jessica Creighton, also raised the alarm after she discovered the unfolding situation.

She was told the news while covering the Youth Olympics in China and posted on Twitter that someone 'very dear' needed 'urgent help'.

According to The Independent, Miss Fonthes, who works as a translator, reached the British Embassy to apply for emergency travel documents.

However she couldn't stay there and was reportedly captured by police while travelling with her friend in a taxi.

Following the ordeal, Miss Fonthes is heading back to the UK after what her girlfriend says has been an 'unbelievably tough few days'.  

Miss Creighton, who is travelling back to the UK, told the paper: 'It became apparent that her family were unhappy with her decision to be an out lesbian, they took her passport and [were] refusing to give it back.

'We have just found out Chris is now back with her family. Who knows what they might do?' 

An online petition was set up in a bid to bring her back and was signed by more than 500 people.

Social media users also started a campaign to raise awareness of her situation.

Same-sex activity is legal in the African, but couples regularly face prosecution under laws banning public indecency. 

The translator from Manchester was in the country's capital Kinshasa (file picture) when she was seized by police after being released from the British Embassy
