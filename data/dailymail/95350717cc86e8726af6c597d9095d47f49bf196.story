One small garden lizard showed extreme bravery squaring up to a cat intent on making it a meal.

The Oriental garden lizard decided to fight back when the pet took a swipe at it on a grassy patch in Malaysia.

The cat, a local stray, was so surprised by the lizard’s boldness that the reptile was able to make a quick getaway and incredibly, survive the feline’s attack.

The lizard stood its ground, raising itself on its front legs and opening its mouth in an attempt to scare off the cat as it stood threateningly over the lizard.

Amateur photographer Adzrin Taib spotted the assault and quickly grabbed his camera, capturing these amusing, mid-fight pictures.

He said: ‘I loved the idea of the lizard being so brave and I decided to grab my camera, luckily it had a happy ending too.

The stare off: The moggy was surprised to find that the little lizard stood its ground, allowing the lizard to make a quick get away

‘The little lizard got away this time. I think the cat was surprised his dinner was trying to fight back.

‘In Malaysia we have a lot of lizards and I love seeing them in the garden.

'They all seem to have their own little characters. But a lot do get attacked by cats sadly.'

Oriental garden lizards are found throughout Asia and can change colour to bright red, black and brown.

During breeding season the male's throat turns bright red which has led to the incorrect nickname of 'bloodsucker'.

They are related to iguanas and can move each of their eyes in different directions like a chameleon.

Waiting to pounce: Amateur photographer Adzrin Taib caught the action on camera and said 'the cat was surprised his dinner was trying to fight back'
