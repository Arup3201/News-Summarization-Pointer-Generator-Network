From how to make the perfect cup of tea to what do do when having friends round for supper ('when hosting a party move any clutter from the space where you'll be entertaining'), Pippa Middleton's party planning guide, Celebrate, wasn't exactly groundbreaking.

It did, however, spawn spoof Twitter account @pippatips, which produces hilariously banal Pippa style suggestions ('smoke can be sign of a new pope or that something is on fire') and has racked up 40,000 followers to date.

Now the unnamed person behind @pippatips is to launch a guide to middle class motherhood called What To Expect When One Is Expecting: A Posh Person’s Guide To Pregnancy And Parenting.

Unintentionally funny: Pippa Middleton with the book that launched a thousand spoof tweets

'Getting published is one of the best ways for people to be able to buy the book that you have written,' says the author.

'It came to my attention that we were in the middle of a baby boom, so what better time for me to write a complete guide to pregnancy, babies and parenting?

'Though families have struggled through in the past without my help, with my new guide having a baby in your life has never been easier or more enjoyable!’

The book, adds the author, will lovingly dispense invaluable maternity and parenting advice on how best to bring up Baby – from womb to silver spoon.

'From the best supplements to take (The Sunday Times ‘Style’ magazine is essential), to the perfect remedies for morning sickness (try sleeping until the afternoon) it’s a book no expectant mother or new parent can do without.'

Useful? The satirical new book will be packed with tips on how to bring up the well bred child

Although the book won't hit shelves until the 6th June, the anonymous author agreed to provide a special tip, exclusively for MailOnline readers.

'There are lots of ways of keeping friends and family updated throughout your pregnancy,' @pippatips explains. 'Try phone, text, twitter or the Mail (which comes in an Online, Daily or Sunday edition).'

But will the book do any better than the real Pippa's much maligned effort? You'll have to wait until June to find out!

What To Expect When One is Expecting: A Posh Person’s Guide to Pregnancy and Parenting from the creator of @Pippatips, £8.99 (or £6.99 for the e-book) is published on 6th June by Icon Books. 

@pippatips isn't the only Royal spoof account to have written a book.

The hugely popular @Queen_UK (sample tweet: 'What exactly does one have to do to get rid of Abu Qatada?! Even Justin Bieber left after some persuasion.') released a tome called Gin O'Clock last year and now has her very own e-shop, complete with regal baby wear.

But will the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's child be seen in one of these?

Regal: 'Born to Rule' babygros are available in pink, grey, white, red, black and green and cost £14.10 each

Babygros are available online from gin-oclock.com. Read more from @queen_uk on Twitter.
