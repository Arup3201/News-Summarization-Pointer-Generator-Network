Author Marti Perarnau was given total access to Bayern Munich during the 2013-14 season, Pep Guardiola's first in charge of the Bundesliga giants.

In his new book Pep Confidential, Perarnau uses his behind-the-scenes pass to give readers a unique insight into Guardiola's debut campaign in Germany.

In this extract he covers Bayern's memorable performance against Manchester City in the Champions League, a night where Guardiola's men played like Barcelona to leave the Etihad with a 3-1 victory.

Pep Guardiola admits Champions League semi-final defeat by Real Madrid was the 'biggest f***-up' of his life as a coach

Pep Guardiola admits that he could see himself managing Manchester United one day (and he turned down Manchester City and Chelsea for the Bayern Munich job!)

A grand total of 94 consecutive passes across three minutes and 27 seconds was emblematic of the 'taking of Manchester' – a night when Bayern conquered the Etihad Stadium and Pep Guardiola was finally able to smile in satisfaction. Inevitably, Bayern's play in this 3-1 win at the home of Manchester City drew to mind that of Barca on that remarkable night in 2010 when they hammered Mourinho's Real Madrid 5-0 at the Camp Nou.

Those 94 passes marked a special moment in European football. The reigning champions were in an intimidating and formidable football stadium, City had bought notable reinforcements during the close season and their coach was the excellent Manuel Pellegrini – unbeaten at home until that point.

Everything went right for Bayern for 80 sweet minutes. They were almost perfect – it was the game in which Pep proved to himself that he could get a team to play with the agility and quality of Barcelona without actually having those 'Azulgrana' players. All along, everyone, including Guardiola, had strenuously attempted to be clear that this wasn't supposed to be Barca 2.0.

Arjen Robben summed up the feelings of the dressing room: 'We have produced 80 fantastic minutes but we aren't Barcelona MkII. I understand the comparisons but we don't have players like Xavi or Messi and we are, basically, different. We just want to dominate games by dominating possession.'

Before speaking to the media, Guardiola is in the dressing room and takes time to phone a friend: 'Calm, and feet on the ground kiddo, but... what an exhibition! What an exhibition!'

The Bayern goals come from their three forward players. (Franck) Ribery repeats his jink into space and fierce shot which squared the score against Chelsea in the Super Cup. (Thomas) Müller is terrific in losing Gael Clichy, who is over-run, in order to hit the second, after which Bayern string together a succession of passes over 40 seconds which leaves their rival in tatters. After (Toni) Kroos robs the ball back in the centre circle, Robben zig-zags around so much that he leaves Matija Nastasic sea-sick and scores with a right-foot shot.

Pellegrini's side has just whipped Manchester United 4-1, but for a while it's like Bayern are making them dance. The shielding players, the formidable Yaya Toure and Fernandinho, are tied up by Ribery, Muller, Robben and (Bastian) Schweinsteiger over and over again. Along with Kroos, they give a recital in how to control possession, so disorientating the home players that the Spanish TV commentator, Gaby Ruiz, a specialist in German football, says: 'For the City players, what we are seeing is a little embarrassing. In fact, City are hauling up the white flag of surrender.'

Then, in the 65th minute, Bayern lay on a gigantic rondo – a succession of passes which astonishes the world of football for its precision, speed and duration. During nearly three-and-a-half minutes, Bayern put together 94 passes involving all 10 outfield players. The team pass the ball for more than 200 seconds during which time the Etihad Stadium goes silent and the City players pretty much surrender. 

During this succession of passes the ball bounces off the English defenders twice, it is deflected by Clichy once and Jesus Navas wins it back once, but manages to keep it in City's possession for only seven seconds before (Philipp) Lahm robs it back with a brilliant tackle. 

All in all it's so spectacular that that very night various YouTube users put all three minutes 27 seconds up on the internet – sometimes with accelerated motion and accompanied by the theme tune from The Benny Hill Show.

The giant rondo sums up what Pep has been asking his players to learn. The stats tell the story: Kroos passes the ball 18 times in this one action, then Robben (14), Schweinsteiger (13), Ribery (12), Rafinha (11) and Lahm (10). The defenders and centre forward have been involved slightly less – (Jerome) Boateng (7 passes), (David) Alaba (6), Muller (2), Dante (1).

If the performances of the midfielders have been memorable (Kroos and Schweinsteiger both boast 95 per cent pass accuracy), the exhibition laid on by Muller leaves Pep speechless. Even more than fulfilling the essence of the false nine, he has given a fluid forward display, flitting in and out of all the attacking positions and popping up where he is least expected.

Bayern's display unleashes a stream of praise. Michael Owen talks about his amazement at 'this great exhibition'. Franco Baresi, the former Milan and Italy captain, talks about 'a great level of super-positive football with everyone participating, and which is great fun to watch'. Rio Ferdinand says: 'It was hard to imagine the Bayern which won the treble improving but Pep is achieving just that.'

The then Bayern president, Uli Hoeness, glows: 'For 80 minutes we played perfect football – the best football I've seen in my life.'

During the post-match dinner which Bayern always lays on for players, coaches, sponsors and media, whether they win or lose, Kalle Rummenigge sums it all up in just a few words: 'A fiesta for the eyes.'

From this point, Bayern begin to play the football their new coach wants. 'For everything to come off for us, the players need to run their legs off but to use the ball like they did when they were kids,' Pep explains. His players are bubbling with excitement.

Ribery: 'They are little details but really important. Pep has boosted my confidence.'

Schweinsteiger: 'He's got incredible ideas.'

Robben: 'His arrival has been refreshing, a great stimulus. I'm 29 but under Pep I'm learning tactical concepts I'd never heard of before.'

Right now we can't be absolutely certain if the Etihad is the turning point of Bayern's entire season, but it is unquestionable that October 2, 2013 will forever be a red letter day for Guardiola. When they land back in Munich the coach reads a quote from Lothar Matthaus in a newspaper: 'Tiki-taka has reached Bavaria.'

Pep throws it in the bin.
