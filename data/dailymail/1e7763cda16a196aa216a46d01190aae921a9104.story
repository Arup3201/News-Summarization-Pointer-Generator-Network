The classic unsung hero, as Steven Anderson was described by former boss Owen Coyle recently, will now form one of the high notes of a celebratory St Johnstone tune until the end of time after sending Tommy Wright’s grafters on to glory.

The Scottish Cup, 130 years and the  outstanding Steven MacLean — who clinched the prize six minutes from time — are other key lyrics required to laud an achievement that has been so long in the making that it has tested the patience of hundreds of thousands of Saints.

But they wait no more to have gleaming silverware in Perth, while at Tannadice, the future remains bright for Dundee United’s young stars of tomorrow.

The present, though, is absolutely 
dazzling for Saints’ men of the moment at a club that runs as one of the
 steadiest operations in the otherwise madhouse arena that is Scottish 
football.

‘May 17’ — the 
date and shirt number of Wright’s star striker Stevie — was supposed to 
be the Cup Final omen. But the victory  signpost could actually be found
 on a film marked ‘Apr 19’.

On
 that day last month, Anderson opened  the scoring with a back-post 
header as  St Johnstone beat Jackie McNamara’s side  2-0 — a third 
success against United on  Premiership business this term.

As
 part of his planning for yesterday, Wright compiled a DVD for his team 
of the sort of goals typically conceded by the Tannadice defence. How 
that move paid off as the men from Perth worked the trick once more.

Perhaps
 it was fitting, after May had grabbed so much of the spotlight all 
season for his scoring heroics, that so many of the  understated Saints 
shone at Celtic Park.

Manager
 Wright talked fondly of a photo he liked from the semi-final win over 
Aberdeen at Ibrox that featured Anderson, Chris Millar, Frazer Wright 
and Dave Mackay celebrating after suffering so many last-four letdowns 
over the years.

Perhaps the 
snapshots of yesterday warrant a double take from some of these guys, 
just to confirm their St Johnstone careers will be defined by this 
mighty triumph — and never again by near misses.

It
 was deserved, too. Although they were underdogs yesterday, Saints’ 
victory was no great surprise. That’s only one loss in the last nine 
meetings with United.

Wright
 had a disagreement with McNamara on the touchline during St Johnstone’s
 1-0 win at Tannadice in March but they were in accord over the 
deployment of United’s teenage stars Ryan Gauld and John Souttar.

The
 Northern Irishman’s pre-match  prediction was spot on as the youngsters
 began on the bench, while he stayed true to the team that won their 
semi-final. But it wasn’t inexperience that cost United. Rather, a 
couple of dubious moments from goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak proved 
critical.

And yet it was the
 Pole’s counterpart, Alan Mannus, who betrayed signs of early nerves, 
spilling a Ryan Dow cross under pressure from Nadir Ciftci.

However,
 it was St Johnstone who settled into a more assured stride. May 
wondered if Cierzniak might be similarly jittery, taking speculative aim
 from distance but failing to trouble the keeper, who had warmed up by 
the time James Dunne tested him. The on-loan Stevenage man hit a shot 
from 22 yards after a David Wotherspoon lay-off and Cierzniak sprang to 
tip the shot over.

The 
corner dropped into the path of Wright’s late arrival into the box but 
the ball came off his shin and trickled into the arms of keeper.

After
 being dumped for each of the last two Hampden showpieces by Pat Fenlon 
at Hibs, Wotherspoon made the most of getting the call and he was quick 
to pounce on the United wall’s deflection of a May free-kick.

After cutting smartly inside Keith Watson, Wotherspoon saw Cierzniak deal well with a shot that took a nick off Gavin Gunning.

The league’s second-top scorers, United are never timid for long and at last came a killer delivery from Andrew Robertson.

Dow
 ghosted in to offer a flick that bounded off the base of the far post 
and, to the delight of Mannus, back into play before being cleared.

United
 then claimed for handball against Wotherspoon as Gunning tried to 
thread in Dow. But minutes later, it was Wotherspoon who crafted the 
opening goal in first-half injury time.

His corner convinced Cierzniak to make a bone-headed break from his goal and come flapping for the ball.

Anderson,
 meanwhile, faked a run to clear himself of close policing and peeled 
away to rise and meet the cross six yards out. Watson was the nearest 
but helpless attendant as Anderson nodded into the unguarded net.

The
 St Johnstone manager suspected United might be vulnerable to dead-ball 
deliveries in the air. Little wonder, then, that he waved a clenched 
fist as he turned heels and darted for the team talk.

McNamara’s
 was more succinct as his men emerged first after the interval hell-bent
 on a quick reply. That made for an increasingly combative second half.

The 50th-minute drama provided the moment that must have convinced Saints fans that this would be their day.

Ciftci,
 a bruising presence to front the United attack all afternoon, floated a
 free-kick over the wall. Off the crossbar it came, the ball falling 
kinder than any Saints player could have dreamt of as it nestled cosily 
aside the grounded Mannus when it could easily have cannoned off him and
 over the line.

Illegal 
means were then tried at the opposite end to do just that. Wright’s free
 header guided the ball into the path of May, who appeared to be 
successfully bundling home a 28th goal of the season before Cierzniak 
scrambled a save. May then used his hand for the final nudge. Referee 
Craig Thomson  initially awarded the goal, but the extra  officials were
 bound to come in useful one of these years and Alan Muir correctly 
snatched the celebrations back off the Saints fans.

Wotherspoon
 at one end, then Robertson at the other, were denied then the call for 
Gauld came on 64 minutes, Gary Mackay-Steven making way. Millar was the 
shadow for Gauld and the action passed the kid by.

Brian
 Graham was introduced to partner Ciftci and no one dug deeper than the 
Turkish forward for an equaliser. No one went closer, either, than he 
did when rifling a low drive from 20 yards that skimmed the outside of 
Mannus’s right hand post.

But
 it was the extra striker selection of Saints that proved the winner. 
MacLean’s hold-up play and knockdowns had been a fine feature all day 
and, six minutes from time, he shot into centre stage.

A
 May crossfield pass took a wild deflection and, as MacLean slid in with
 Cierzniak, the first crunching contact was a draw. The second scramble 
for possession quickly saw the striker hook his foot around the ball and
 steer it into the empty net.

MacLean
 stripped off his top as he wheeled away to greet the acclaim of the 
Perth fans and earned the happiest booking of his life.

Graham
 missed a chance to make it nervy at the death with a free header. So, 
20 years since Craig Brewster stopped a string of Hampden horror stories
 for United, St Johnstone  legends were at last created from the dramas 
of this Scottish Cup Final.
