The seven-year-old star of this year's John Lewis Christmas advert is as kind and thoughtful as his on-screen character, say his parents.

Lewis McGowan, from Hamilton, near Glasgow, appears in the 90-second commercial impatiently waiting for Christmas morning to arrive.

But when it finally does the little boy doesn't rush to open his presents, but dashes to fetch the gift he's got for his parents.

The ad, dubbed 'one of the greatest ever,' ends with the strap line 'For gifts you can't wait to give'.

Tearjerker: The £6m advert has been dubbed 'one of the greatest' ever

The £6million production, which went 
online on Friday and appeared on television during the X Factor, has
already received more than 500,000 hits on YouTube.

Lewis's father Stuart, 37, said: 'He is just like the boy in the 
advert - so kind and always thinking of others.'

And his mother Julie, 36, told the Daily Telegraph that last year 
her son asked Father Christmas for a tea-cup for her and this year 
wants to give his brother Connor, 11, an iPod.

Lewis was picked from 250 
other children and hopes to build on his success, signing with acting 
agencies. He filmed the advert over five days in London.

It uses a new version of The Smiths' classic Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want sung by Slow Moving Millie.

Lead singer Morrissey was said to be 'very happy' with the finished product.

The new version has divided fans of the 1980s' anti-establishment band with many saying they can't believe the singer has allowed the song to be used so the department store can sell 'middle-class tat'.

Last year, the John Lewis ad was viewed around 440,000 times in 11 months.

The department store chain said strong 
sales of e-book readers have helped its Christmas trading season get off
to a 'resilient' start.

It said it was 'clearly going 
to be a very techy' Christmas after seeing a strong rise in demand for 
electronics, including Apple's iPad and Amazon's 
Kindle.

Sales of Christmas trees, home 
furnishings and bedding were also up in the week to Saturday November 12
as shoppers started gearing up for the holiday season.

Overall sales were down 0.8 per cent 
compared with the same period a year ago, but that represented a resilient
performance given the state of economy, it said.

The retailer, which has 32 stores, also claimed the recent mild weather had weakened demand for winter clothing.

Retail director Andrew Murphy said: 'Shoppers are cautious but not nervous.

'I think people have got the measure 
of how things are and they understand that the mood music is going to be
a bit volatile, but it takes an awful lot to knock people off their 
stride before Christmas.

'Given the external factors at work we are pretty happy with that performance.'

He said gifts such as food hampers 
were also in demand and, in a sign of the times, sales of executive 
stress-busting toys were also up.
