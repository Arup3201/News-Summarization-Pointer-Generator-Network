A German astrophotographer has captured a dazzling image of the Orion Nebula from his back garden.

Reinhold Wittich took the colourful photograph from his backyard observatory using a 12 inch f/4 Newton telescope.

The image show swirls of vivid colours in the star-forming region of the nebula which are created by the release of oxygen and hydrogen gases.

Reinhold Wittich took a colourful image of the Orion Nebula from his back garden in Germany which he admits has been processed using computer software including CCDStack, PixInsight and Photoshop

The Orion Nebula, also known as M42, is a diffuse nebula situated south of Orion's Belt in the constellation of Orion.

It is 1,500 light years away from Earth and is believed to be 24 light years wide.

The nebula can be seen with the naked eye near the constellation Orion.

It is the closest region of massive star formation to Earth and has a mass about 2000 times that of the sun.

The Orion Nebula is one of the most photographed objects in the light sky and it has revealed a lot about how stars are created from collapsing clouds of gas and dust.

The beautiful image is impressive, but Mr Wittich does admit that it has been processed using computer software including CCDStack, PixInsight and Photoshop.

Mr Wittich told SPACE.com: ‘The weather was not very good this winter, so it took a few nights to catch the data.’

Mr
 Wittich is not the first astrophotographer to capture the nebula from 
his back garden – mathematician Mark Shelley, from Sidcup in Kent, has 
also managed to capture stunning images of it from his garden.

Mr
 Shelley managed to record the images by using very long exposures to 
'soak up' as much light as possible as his motorised telescope tracked 
across the sky.

Amazingly, he did it all on a second-hand telescope he received as a Christmas present.
