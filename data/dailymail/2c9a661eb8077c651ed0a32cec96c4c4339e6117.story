Barcelona star Neymar is usually dazzling fans with his football skills but the Brazil international has proven you can’t be good at everything with some dodgy singing.

The 22-year-old posted a video on his Instagram attempting to soulfully sing along to a song with his mates; however he unfortunately fails to find his vocal range and should certainly stick to finding the back of the net.

Neymar has recovered from a sore left ankle, and having trained this week is back in contention for Barcelona’s La Liga match against Cordoba on Saturday.

The Brazilian has not featured for the Catalan club since December 10, scoring the second goal in their 3-1 Champions League victory at home to Paris St Germain.

Neymar has missed Barcelona's last two games, as they trail league leaders Real Madrid by four points ahead of hosting Cordoba, who are struggling in 19th in La Liga.

Despite increased competition upfront this season with the arrival of Luis Suarez, Neymar has scored 14 goals in 18 appearances for Barcelona this season with a fine run of form.
