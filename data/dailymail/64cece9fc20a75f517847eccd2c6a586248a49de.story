It was just over two months ago that McDonald's released an advertisement stating it 'will never be kale'.

But it seems the fast food giant may be having a change of heart regarding the trendy super food, with a new report suggesting that McDonald's plans to introduce kale to its menu soon.

Janney Capital Markets restaurant analysts wrote that 'one of our industry sources indicates that McDonald's U.S. plans to roll out kale as an ingredient in its restaurants at some point in the not-too-distant future.'

Janney analyst Mark Kalinowski told CNN the move could mean kale salads and even smoothies may be on the horizon and said the company's goal is to appear healthier or of a higher quality.

'McDonald's clearly aims to raise consumers' perception of the quality of its food. Adding kale to the menu in some way could help be a step in this direction,' he wrote.

However, McDonald's stayed mum when questioned about the superfood, telling CNN, in part: 'we're always looking at new and different ingredients.'

Either way, don't expect your future Big Macs to be piled with the curly greens. Six weeks ago, the fast food mega chain debuted a commercial in which the words 'WILL NEVER BE KALE' appeared in block letters over the signature burger's lettuce layer.

The news comes after McDonald's on Monday vowed to remake itself as a 'modern, progressive burger company' after aggressive competition from Chipotle, Chick-fil-A and myriad 'better burger' chains bit into U.S. restaurant sales last month.

February ended the run of former Chief Executive Don Thompson. His short tenure included 2014, when falling profit, revenue and traffic resulted in one of McDonald's worst years in decades.

Steve Easterbrook, a McDonald's insider who led two UK-based restaurant chains before returning to the company in 2013, took the helm at the Golden Arches on March 1.

The company that virtually invented fast food has struggled to find the right recipe to meet diners' growing appetite for healthier, fresher food.

In his first big move as CEO, Easterbrook last week announced that McDonald's USA will switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics. The policy, which will affect McNuggets and other products sold in its roughly 14,000 U.S. stores, will put McDonald's more in step with Chipotle and Chick-fil-A.

McDonald's shares were up 0.8 percent at $97.90 at midday. The stock is up about 10 percent since Easterbrook's promotion was announced in late January.

Sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months dropped a steeper-than-expected 4 percent in February, contributing to the 1.7 percent decline in global sales for the month.

Analysts, on average, had expected a 0.7 percent fall for the United States and a 0.3 percent drop worldwide, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.

February sales results from Europe were slightly better than expected, but the unit that includes Asia continued to struggle with the after-effects of a supply chain scandal last year.

McDonald's has been trimming complicated menus to speed up service; giving restaurant operators more control over aspects including regional food choices; testing customized burgers and sandwiches to compete with Chipotle, Subway and other popular restaurants; and tweaking advertising to emphasize 'Lovin,' a play on the company's ubiquitous 'I'm lovin' it' tagline.

Still, one pension fund adviser on Monday renewed its call for McDonald's to shake up its board.

'Today's disappointing numbers underscore the widespread reforms McDonald's requires ... and these changes must go beyond new management to include refreshing its stale and insular board,' said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds that hold a small percentage of McDonald's shares.
