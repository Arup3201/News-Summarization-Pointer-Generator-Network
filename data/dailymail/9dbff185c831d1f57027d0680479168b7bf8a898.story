A terminally ill father made sure his biggest supporter was with him every step of the way as he won a marathon - by pushing his six-year-old daughter in her pram along the entire 26-mile route.

Iram Leon, 32, was first over the finish line at the Gusher Marathon in Texas with a time of three hours, seven minutes, and 35 seconds, but insisted he 'came in second' behind daughter Kiana.

Keen runner Mr Leon, who was diagnosed with brain cancer shortly after turning 30, has already completed half a dozen races with Kiana, after deciding he no longer wanted to compete without taking his 'princess' along.

But Mr Leon had a battle on his hands to get the pair their first joint marathon medal even before the race began, as prams are not typically permitted on the lengthy routes.

He was turned down for entry four times before the Gusher Marathon agreed to let the father-daughter duo compete, according to a report on the Huffington Post.

The team of two, who completed their first half-marathon in October 2012, went on to take home gold in the marathon in Beaumont on Saturday.

Mr Leon, who has been told his cancer will not be cured, said: 'The one thing I'm not going to say on my death bed is, "I wish I spent more time with my kid".'

He was diagnosed with a grade two diffuse astrocytoma in November 2010. Doctors hope he will live to see his 40th birthday.

Mr Leon is divorced from Kiana's mother and his daughter lives with him the majority of the time at his home in Austin, Texas. The devoted father has told Kiana about his illness, and said he hopes to strike the right balance between protecting her from his experience and sharing it with her.

Kiana has witnessed her father suffering seizures as a result of his illness and the pair practice what to do in an emergency should Mr Leon suddenly need urgent medical attention.

His brain tumour, which affects his memory
 and language skills, means Mr Leon can't drive, work, or play contact 
sports, but his cancer has not hampered his ability to run.

It's 'just one foot in front of the 
other', said the determined father, who writes a blog about his 
experiences of coping with cancer.

In it he described being 'floored' as he realised he was in the lead at the half-way mark on Saturday.

'Was there a possibility that I could win not a division, not an age group but a marathon with my inspiration directly in front of me?' he wrote.

Devoted: Mr Leon said cancer had not hampered 'my ability to run and love'

Mr Leon, who said he was 'sore' and 'grateful' after the marathon, recalled listening to Bon Jovi's hit It's My Life as he pushed his daughter ahead of him throughout the gruelling race.

'Turns out that maybe brain cancer, which
 has come with some nightmare scenarios, also has had some that are 
better than I could have ever dreamed,' he wrote.

'...At the Gusher Marathon, against 
the wind and up hill, with my princess and inspiration a step ahead of 
me, I ran on a highway even if I'm not allowed to drive on it.'

'Grateful': Mr Leon, seen pushing his waving daughter as he runs, said the attention had left him feeling 'grateful, confused, humble and overwhelmed'

The runner has been inundated with phone calls and e-mails since news of his feat spread from a local newspaper in Texas via the sports pages of the Wall Street Journal to the international media, and the organisers behind the Gusher Marathon have set up a fundraising website with the aim of raising $30,000 for Kiana's college education.

Over $1,000 has already been donated.

Her father wrote on his blog that the attention had left him feeling 'grateful, confused, humbled and overwhelmed'.

He said: '... There's something incredibly comforting about the fact that cancer and its side effects have ruined many things, but they haven't taken away my ability to run and love.

'... Perhaps the reason the universe was kind enough to let me win the only marathon that has ever let me in pushing Kiana was to remind me why it's letting me keep breathing, even if it's hard, a little bit longer.'
