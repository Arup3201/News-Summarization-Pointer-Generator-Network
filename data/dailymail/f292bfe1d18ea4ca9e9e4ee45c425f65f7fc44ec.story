Sami Khedira arrived in Germany on Friday to watch his brother Rani play for Leipzig, sparking suggestions that he is about to join Bayern Munich.

The German's current club Real Madrid took on local rivals Atletico  in Friday's Spanish Super Cup, but Khedira was not named in the squad and was allowed to leave the country by manager Carlo Ancelotti .

Khedira has made it plain that he wants to leave Los Blancos, but it is unclear whether Bayern's manager Pep Guardiola is interested in the World Cup winning midfielder.

Disgruntled: Khedira is angry that Real will not meet his contract demands

Sportsmail understands that Khedira is not Guardiola's first choice for the central midfield position, which could put the breaks on the deal. 

The Bayern manager does not always get his own way however, and was left frustrated by the departure of Toni Kroos to Real Madrid this summer, so it may be that Khedira will join the club even if the Spaniard is not entirely sure about him.

The injury to Javi Martinez, who is ruled out for the whole season with a cruciate ligament injury, has also reduced Guardiola's options in midfield and made signing a central midfielder more pressing.  

Khedira had been linked with a move to the Premier League earlier in the summer, with Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal all reportedly interested, but no firm bid has yet been made.

Champion: Khedira was a key player for the Germany team that won this summer's World Cup
