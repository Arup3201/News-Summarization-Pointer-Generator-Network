A man whose surname is Hippy has been told he faces prison after police found £8,000 worth of cannabis growing in his garage.

Gregory Hippy, 36, converted the garage of his home in Lincoln into an extensive cannabis factory.

When police raided the house in May this year, they discovered 28 cannabis plants, which had a street value of £8,000.

Magistrates heard Hippy had converted the garage for the sole purpose of cannabis growth.

The court heard bricks had been removed from the garage wall and ventilation pipes had been installed.

There were also white plastic sheets on the walls, the court was told. 

Prosecutor Shirley Wilson said: 'The drug experts said there was a strong commercial element to this grow.'

The court was told how Hippy found the drug growing equipment in the property when he moved in.

Tony Freitas, defending, said: 'He says he bought the seeds on the internet. To his shock, they kept on seeding so he kept on going with it. 

'He says all the equipment was at the address from the previous tenant.

'He says he was simply doing it because it was cheaper than buying it.'  

Hippy admitted producing a class B drug when he appeared at Lincoln Magistrates' Court, but he denied selling it for profit. 

He was granted unconditional bail until his sentencing, due to be held at a later date.
