Alex Salmond is under pressure to hand back a £65,000 ‘golden goodbye’ he received from taxpayers when he last stood down from Westminster.

The former First Minister received a so-called ‘resettlement grant’ when he gave up his Banff and Buchan seat in 2010, but is now plotting a return to the Commons in next year’s election.

The money is intended to assist outgoing MPs in ‘adjusting to non-parliamentary life’, even though Mr Salmond has remained in politics.

Alex Salmond announced that he will seek the SNP’s nomination to stand in the north-east seat of Gordon, which overlaps his Aberdeenshire East Holyrood constituency

There was an outcry in 2010 when he received the grant, which in total was just below £65,000 – the equivalent of his annual Westminster salary. The first £30,000 was tax free, leaving a net sum of around £50,000 – half of which Mr Salmond donated to a charity named after his late mother.

The resettlement scheme has since been reformed and will be restricted to a maximum of six months’ salary come next May, with only those MPs who fight and lose their seat eligible. It is set to be watered down once again after 2015.

Last night, Scottish Conservative North East MSP Alex Johnstone said: ‘With Alex Salmond seeking a return to Westminster, the public would generally accept that this money has been paid inappropriately.'

Mr Johnstone added: ‘When cash from the taxpayer has been paid out inappropriately, it should be returned. And that’s not just the cash he kept, but the money he gave away too.’

On Sunday, Mr Salmond announced that he will seek the SNP’s nomination to stand in the north-east seat of Gordon, which overlaps his Aberdeenshire East Holyrood constituency. It is held by LibDem grandee Sir Malcolm Bruce with a commanding majority of 6,748, however he is standing down and support for his party is expected to collapse in May’s election.

Mr Salmond was previously an MP for nearby Banff and Buchan from 1987 until 2010, with his length of service entitling him to the full £65,000 resettlement grant when he stood down from the Commons.

During a televised leaders’ debate in 2010, Scottish Tory MP David Mundeall asked him: ‘The resettlement grant is for people leaving politics so, Alex, are you intending to leave politics?’

Mr Salmond replied that he would make a ‘further substantial donation’ into a charitable trust named after his late mother that helps youth organisations in Aberdeenshire.

‘I know of no person previously in Westminster politics who has said he will donate from the resettlement grant to worthy work in the North-East of Scotland,’ he said.

Mr Salmond added: ‘Unfortunately for you and your party, David, I intend to be here for some time to take this nation to freedom.’

If he is successful in his attempt to represent Gordon, Mr Salmond will still be an MSP for Aberdeenshire East until at least 2016. He will receive a ‘dual mandate’ salary made up of his MP wage and a third of his MSP salary, and has promised to donate the extra cash to charity.

An SNP spokesman said: ‘The fact that the Tories seem to have conceded that they expect Alex Salmond to be elected in Gordon is a welcome one, but must do little for the morale of their own candidate.

‘After tax paid, half of the resettlement grant was donated to charity and Mr Salmond has made clear that if he is elected and holds a dual mandate, one of his salaries will also be donated to support good causes in the North East - just as he did previously.

‘To date the Mary Salmond Trust has already received £100,000 in this way to support young people in the North East of Scotland.’

The former First Minister is also the final recipient of a controversial non-contributory pension scheme which entitles him to a sum equivalent to half his salary. However, he has vowed to hand the £42,000-a-year deal to the Mary Salmond Trust.

In 2011, Labour’s dual mandate MP/MSP Margaret Curran stood down from Holyrood and gave her entire resettlement grant to charity.

Meanwhile, Mr Salmond yesterday said he wants to be an MP to ‘to keep hope alive’ for people who voted for Scottish independence. He said the Lib Dems are now a ‘busted flush’ but he expects ‘strong competition’ from the Conservatives in Gordon.

However, sitting MP Sir Malcom Bruce said: ‘The people of Scotland and the people of the UK have got to make a decision: what kind of government do you want?

‘Do you want chaos, multi-party inability to make decisions? We've had a strong government that has been able to do that. Or do you want the SNP causing disruption and not representing the interests of the people, certainly of Gordon, who didn't vote to send members to Westminster to break up the UK but actually want Scotland and the UK to work together for the people of Gordon?’
