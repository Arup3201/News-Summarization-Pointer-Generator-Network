Manny Pacquiao continues to step up his preparations ahead of the $300million (£200m) mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather in May.

Having come face-to-face earlier in the week in Los Angeles, the pair returned to their respective camps and got back to the serious business of training.

On Day 12 of his road workout Pacquiao was joined by fans as he stretched and pushed himself to the limits as he looks to step up his fitness levels.

Both athletes’ momentum is gaining rapidly and it was announced earlier in the week that the duo had agreed to conduct the mega-fight under the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) testing program.

The Las Vegas showdown will observe the rules established under the World Anti-Doping Code (Code), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List and the USADA Protocol for Olympic and Paralympic Movement Testing.

Both fighters have agreed to unannounced blood and urine testing without reservation and will be tested out of competition prior to the fight and in competition after the fight.
