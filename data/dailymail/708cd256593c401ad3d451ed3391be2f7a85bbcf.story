The newest version of Grand Theft Auto allows players to experience sex with a prostitute from a first-person perspective.

What's more, players of the massively popular video game may also then beat the woman up.

It's all made possible in the revamping of the 2013 game for the newer Playstation 4 and Xbox One consoles.

Outrageous: The newest version of Grant Theft Auto V lets players have sex with a prostitute from a first-person perspective for the first time

Re-release: The re-release happened Tuesday and now makes the game available for PS4 and Xbox One console users and in first-person at the touch of a button

Even more shocking? Players also get to brutally murder their escorts in order to take back the money they paid for sexual services

Big $$$: The game made $1 billion in its first three days on the market last year, now makers Rockstar Games are looking to get even more out of the lucrative and always controversial game

Previous to this new version, which launched Tuesday, prostitutes did exist in the game, but the player's sexual encounters with them was not explicitly visible.

Now, with new first-person mode, there's no hiding it.

'Picking up a prostitute in first person in Grand Theft Auto V is a legitimately upsetting experience,' wrote @AlecJKM on Twitter.

And Alec wasn't the first, nor will he be the last, who will think so.

Not with players' new ability to watch from behind the wheel of their stolen car as a prostitute performs oral sex on them.

The player may then experience in first-person the act of having sex with that prostitute as she moans and says some very X-rated things.

The icing on this controversial cake is the ability players have to then gruesomely murder their prostitute and take back their money.

As shocking as all that may be, though, this isn't Rockstar Games' first time trying to gin up sales using sex and violence.

The company has always offered players the chance to live like sex-crazed murder hungry criminals. And its always worked out quite well for them.

Grand theft Auto is, after all, the best selling game of all time.

In September of last year, after the first iteration of GTA 5 was released, it made a billion dollars in just three days. 

Players may  experience in first-person the act of having sex with that prostitute as she moans and says some very X-rated things.

The game immediately became controversial after its Tuesday release, just as most previous versions of the game have

What will happen now that the game has become even more realistic? Rockstar probably had a good idea leading up to Tuesday's re-release.

'It's a very intense, in-your-face experience… literally,' says Rob Nelson, the Animation Director on GTA 5, told gaming site IGN.

'Obviously, we felt like one of the most compelling things you could do to make an experience people have had before feel different was the new first-person mode.'

'This new mode gives players the chance to explore the world of Los Santos and Blaine County directly through the eyes of their character, revealing all the world's glorious details in an entirely new way,' Rockstar said.
