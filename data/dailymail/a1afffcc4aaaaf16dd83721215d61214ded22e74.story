Angel di Maria and his family were accompanied by a Manchester United security guard as they made their way to Italian restaurant San Carlo on Wednesday evening.

The club security guard kept a close eye on Di Maria as he made his way into the city centre for dinner.

Manchester United have provided Di Maria with round-the-clock security after the Premier League's most expensive signing was left shaken following an attempted robbery at his house in Cheshire on Saturday night.

He was the victim of a terrifying raid when burglars were believed to have used scaffolding poles to smash their way into his home while he was watching TV with his wife and young daughter.

Three thieves used the metal poles to break through patio doors while the Argentina winger, his wife Jorgelina Cardoso and one-year-old daughter Mia were at the Cheshire mansion.

The break-in occurred at 7.30pm, just hours after the 26-year-old starred for United in their 3-1 win over Leicester City at Old Trafford in the Barclays Premier League.

The 26-year-old playmaker helped United qualify for the fifth round of the FA Cup by appearing in his side's 3-0 win against Cambridge United in Tuesday night's replay.

Di Maria, who joined the Red Devils for  £60million in the summer, has scored four goals for United since sealing a move to England.
