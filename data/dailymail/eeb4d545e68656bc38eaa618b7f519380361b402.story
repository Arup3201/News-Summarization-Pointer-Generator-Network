The Colorado man accused of hiding in the tank of a portable toilet to spy on women while also creating peep holes in other restrooms across the city of Boulder has pleaded not guilty to several charges.

Luke Chrisco, 31, pleaded not guilty on Friday to eight felony counts of second-degree burglary as well as two misdemeanor counts of unlawful sexual contact and criminal invasion of privacy.

Chrisco was arrested a few days after a woman using a portable toilet at a Boulder yoga festival last summer noticed something moving in the tank and then saw a feces-stained man emerge and run away.

Police also think he created peep holes in the bathrooms of several Boulder businesses and on the University of Colorado campus.

Arrested for an unrelated incident in Vail, police said he confessed in detail to specific locations, offering enough description to connect him to the accused hiding places.

Chrisco is being held on $250,000 bond, the Daily Camera reports.

After his arrest last June he spoke openly of his perverted fetish to local news reports, revealing his motivation for the bizarre acts as it making him feel 'blessed' by other's bodily fluids.

In a remarkably frank confession, Chrisco spoke of about how his bizarre obsession began, and how he even changed toilets mid way through so he could watch more women in a 'busier' one.

Shock: The female festival-goer lifted the loo seat last June to discover a man hiding in the tank

Speaking to FOX31 Denver, he said: 'I was…doing a little bit of yoga, and I'm just seeing all these goddesses.

'It seems crazy, but I just felt like I was being blessed by their energy.'

Not put off by the foul odour and threat of catching disease, Chrisco admitted to shifting between different toilets at the Hanuman Yoga Festival on June 17.

He said: 'There's bacteria in there, but to me it's just normal...we all have bodily fluids.

'It seems terrible, but it didn't actually smell that bad or anything.

'I still would have done it even if it smelled a little weird, because where there is muck, there is gold.'

In the remarkably frank interview, Chrisco described how he climbed into the tank, without any shoes, wearing just a t-shirt.

Pervert: Chrisco was only caught after a Boulder cop recognised him from a description of the man who fled a festival covered in faeces

The shocked festival goer who spotted Chricso, told police she dashed outside after noticing something moving inside the tank when she lifted the lid.

Believing there might be a person trapped she asked a man who was standing nearby to go in and check.

He confirmed that there was a man covered in a tarpaulin hiding inside the tank.

A few minutes later, he heard the door lock from the inside. A festival security man waited outside for several minutes before the man finally emerged.

According to festival officials, security tried to detain the man but he ran away, covered in faeces.

Speaking to Boulder's Daily Camera newspaper he described how his sick habit began while travelling through Europe several years ago.

Goddesses: The incident happened at the Hanuman Yoga Festival in Boulder, Colorado where Chrisco described the women as goddesses

He said it began in France when he crept into the girls changing room and, noticing a loose air vent, crept in and hid.

He said: 'These chicks started showing up that I
never had a chance with.

'But I figured at least I 
can see them change or something. I've come to know how interesting they
are.'

'I wanted to start a new goddess religion.

'I 
always wanted to be a pimp or create a church of porn or a church of 
tantric, some place people could be spiritual but also instinctual.'

Shockingly Chrisco said he may have spied on as many as 200 women.

Boulder Police spokeswoman Kim Kobel said: 'Detectives have already confirmed that there are 'peepholes' in the restrooms of several local businesses.

'Owners of those businesses are taking appropriate action to seal the holes.'
