Defiant Charlie Hebdo staff gathered in the offices of a rival newspaper today to plan their next edition - just two days after gunmen slaughtered 10 of their colleagues.

Journalists and cartoonists met with staff from French newspaper Liberation - who, along with several other media outlets, have promised to help them produce next week's magazine.

Employees at the satirical magazine who survived the massacre have pledged to create next week's edition in memory of their colleagues and 'write it with our tears'.

Editorial staff from French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo gathered with journalists from rival newspaper Liberation following the deadly attack  by armed gunmen on Wednesday

Among those pictured was French cartoonist Renald Luzier, 42, known as 'Luz', who only escaped the slaughter because he overslept by half an hour and was late for work, according to his wife.

Reporter Lauren Leger, accompanied by cartoonist Catherine Meurisse, was also seen solemnly making his way into the meeting while French police officers lined the entrance.

Journalist Mr Leger, who was in the room where most of the victims were slaughtered, described how some of his colleagues laughed when they first heard shots.

'We thought it was a joke, that it was fire crackers' said Mr Leger.

'Then we heard footsteps. The door opened. A guy shouted 'Allahu Akbar' (God is Great).' 

Mr Leger said he saw 'barbarism enter the newspaper' as the terrorists called out the name 'Charb', referring to editor Stephane Charbonnier, one of those killed.

'They called out the name of Charb, yes. But after that they fired into the group,' said Mr Leger, who threw himself under a table to get away from the gunman and 'escaped his eyes.'

The shooter then turned to his accomplice, with Mr Leger saying: 'He said he thought he had killed everybody, but did not kill women.'  

Pledge: Cartoonist Renald Luzier, known as 'Luz', was also seen at today's meeting - his wife said he escaped the massacre after oversleeping by half an hour yesterday

The French government is pledging around £800,000 to Charlie Hebdo to ensure its survival - the largest of a surge of donations to the satirical magazine following Wednesday's atrocity.

It is due to be published on Wednesday, a week after the Al Qaeda terrorists attacked their offices, killing a guest editor, three cartoonists, two columnists, a sub-editor and Mr Charbonnier.

Charlie Hebdo staff will be using the offices of French newspaper Liberation - while fellow newspaper Le Monde has reportedly vowed to donate computers to the displaced journalists.  

Amid speculation that the cover image could be more provocative than ever, former editor Philippe Val declared: 'We will never stop laughing. We must let people laugh. We must let them ridicule the bastards.' 

Mr Val, who edited the magazine before Mr Charbonnier and was his mentor, said yesterday: 'We have laughed so much, we must continue to laugh. It is difficult today but it's the absolute weapon, laughing.'

He went on to describe the attack as an 'act of war', adding: 'Our country will never be the same.

'A certain kind of journalism has been wiped out. Those who have been exterminated were all people capable of causing laughter with serious ideas.'

The partner of murdered editor Charb, Jeannette Bougrab, was seen flanked by supporters branding 'Je suis Charlie' bannersoutside the Paris City Hall today.

The former Youth and Associations Junior minister was pictured being comforted at the scene yesterday as police and ambulance workers filled the Paris street.

A total of 12 people were killed in the attack - which took place in Charlie Hebdo's office block in the 11th arrondissement of Paris on Wednesday morning.

Witnesses said they heard the gunmen shouting 'We have avenged the Prophet Mohammed', 'God is Great' in Arabic and boasting 'We have killed Charlie Hebdo'. 

The gunmen made their escape, stopping to kill police officer Ahmed Merabet and then to hijack a car after their vehicle was damaged in a crash.
