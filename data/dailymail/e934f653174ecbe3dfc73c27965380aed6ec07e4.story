The Masterson sisters know what it is to have a fight on their hands - six of the seven women have been diagnosed with breast cancer in their early fifties with one sibling dying from the disease last year.

But the tragic circumstances have rallied the close group to live life to the fullest and focus on fundraising for others battling the disease.

The Mastersons, who were raised in southern California, were diagnosed with breast cancer in their early fifties. Only the youngest sister Marianne, 49, has not been diagnosed with the disease.

However rather than wait for a potentially devastating diagnosis, Marianne has been the driving force behind a fundraising team for breast cancer research.

For the past four years, the family and their supportive friends have taken part in the Susan G. Komen three-day walk, raising more than $90,000 for breast cancer research. This year's 60-mile hike will take place in San Diego from November 15 - 17.

Ms Masterson told U-T San Diego: 'The walk is tough. But it’s way better than chemo.'

The seven sisters are among 11 children, all born within 16 years of each other. The family have no history of breast cancer in the older generations with mothers and grandmothers living into their nineties.

The first to be diagnosed was 
second-eldest sister Kathy Dunham who was told 14 years ago that she was
suffering from early-stage carcinoma at the age of 52.

Marianne Masterson is leading the three-day walk to raise funds for breast cancer research. The family's efforts have already topped $90,000 in donations

Two years later, her sister Fran Dyer was diagnosed when she was 54 years old.

Sisters Nancy Usher, Sheila Presto, Linda Barron and Sue Kerby were all diagnosed between the ages of 52 and 54 over the next ten years.

Ms Masterson said the multiple diagnoses had the family 'freaking out'.

The terrible health news did have a small silver lining - it led to each sister taking charge of her life and living exactly how she wanted immediately, now that the future was so uncertain. 

Fran Dyer and her husband moved to the beach where they had wanted to retire sooner than planned. Linda Barron retired eight years early and moved to Oregon.

Ms Masterson was told by a doctor at a gene-testing clinic several years ago that it was not a matter of if she would get cancer but 'when'.

The sisters have taken part in the fundraising walk for the past four years and this year will walk in honor of their sister Sheila who died just before Christmas last year

She now takes a cancer-reducing drug called Tamoxifin, lost weight and overhauled her diet. She is yet to take the step of a double mastectomy but is considering the option.

Ms Masterson decided to pour her energy into fundraising when her sister Sheila's cancer returned in 2009 after she was given the all-clear seven years before.

This time, the disease spread and after fighting for almost four years, Sheila passed away just before Christmas last year on December 18.

Ms Masterson and her partner of 17 years Cathy Orchard launched Team Stride in 2010.

Each year, there is always someone walking to represent each Masterson sister with cancer. Sheila's daughter and son-in-law will be walking in her honor this year.

Ms Masterson said that the fundraising experience has been life-changing for the sisters.

Despite all that they have endured, she told U-T San Diego: 'Three-Day is not a sad day, it’s a 
celebration.'
