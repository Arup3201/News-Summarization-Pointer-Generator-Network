Shot through a door: PC Suzanne Hudson (pictured) suffered serious injuries to her face, neck and hand when a gunman opened fire as she responded to reports of a disturbance at a house

This is the first picture of a female police officer who was shot in the face, neck and hand on just her second shift in her job.

PC Suzanne Hudson was shot through a door after responding to reports of a disturbance at a house in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

A male colleague dragged her from the scene and raised the alarm as the gunman fled on a mountain bike.

The 33-year-old, who was wearing body armour, is being treated for serious injuries in hospital, but is expected to make a full recovery.

Although she is an 'experienced officer' who has been in the force for some years, she had recently switched from neighbourhood policing following her request to be given a more exciting role.

A man has appeared in court today charged with her attempted murder and that of her colleague PC Richard Whiteley, who was uninjured.

James Leslie, 37, spoke to confirm his name, address and date of birth and to indicate he understood the charges against him during the two-minute hearing.

Leslie, who appeared in a 
glass-fronted dock escorted by two female security officers, also stands
charged of possession of a firearm, possession of a firearm with intent
to endanger life, criminal damage and possession of cannabis.

Evidence: The gun allegedly used by James Leslie was dumped on the floor outside a primary school when he was arrested

Leslie,
of Queenswood Drive, Leeds, who wore a long black-sleeved T-shirt, was 
remanded in custody to appear at Leeds Crown Court on December 20.

He
was arrested by heavily-armed officers outside Shire Oak Primary School
in Wood Lane, Headingley, where a sawn-off shotgun was recovered.

The officers were responding to a routine
incident in the Hyde Park area of Leeds, West Yorkshire, in the early 
hours of Wednesday morning.Â 

Row: Kieran Williams, near the scene at Cardigan Road, said he had been in a row with Leslie on Tuesday night

Investigation: Forensic officers search the grounds near a house where the female police officer was shot

Witness Kieran Williams, 17, told how he had a row with the suspect and a women police officer called round to take information from his housemates during the night after a bottle was thrown through their window.

He said he later heard multiple shots.

The teenager said the suspect came to his house, which backs on to the scene of the shooting, complaining that someone was shining a torch through his window.

'He was shouting his mouth off and all that. That argument died down but he was carrying on for about five or six hours. He was going on and on and on.'
