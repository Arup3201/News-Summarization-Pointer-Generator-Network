The last remaining survivors of the infamous Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau are sharing their memories ahead of the 70th anniversary of its liberation. 

An estimated 1.1million people, most of them Jews, were killed at Hitler's most infamous death camp, located in occupied Poland, which later was to become a symbol of the horrors carried out during the Holocaust.

The camp was liberated by Soviet Red Army troops on January 27, 1945 and about 200,000 camp inmates survived, with around 300 still alive today.

Memories: Maria Stroinska, 82, pictured left and right holding a family photo taken before the war, was 12 during the Warsaw Uprising when she and her sister were sent from their house to a camp in Pruszkow before she was moved alone by train to Auschwitz-Birkenau

Prisoner no. 192705: Stefan Sot, 83, pictured left and right in a photo taken during the war, was 13-years-old during the Warsaw Uprising in August 1944, when he was sent from his home to a camp in Pruszkow prior to being sent by train to Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. He was later moved to a labour sub-camp, where he worked in a kitchen for S.S. officers. After the war he worked as a typesetter at a printing house

Survivor: Bogdan Bartnikowski, 82, holds a family photograph as he poses for a portrait in Warsaw.

Survivor Stefan Sot, 83, was one of many sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau during the Warsaw Uprising in August 1944. He was 13 when he and his family arrived.

Maria Stroinska, 82, was also sent out of Warsaw during the Uprising. She was 12 when she and her sister were sent from their house to a camp in Pruszkow before she was moved alone by train to Auschwitz-Birkenau.

Many of those who survived have made it their mission to make sure that the horrors of the Holocaust will not be forgotten. Erzsebet Brodt, 89, was 17-years-old when she was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau along with her family. 

Remembering the journey to the camp she said that those who were 'sick or about to give birth were forced out and put into one wagon. When the wagon was opened in Auschwitz we saw that everyone was dead inside.'

An estimated 1.1million people, most of them Jews, were killed at the Nazi camp which has became a symbol of the horrors of the Holocaust and World War Two.

Lone survivor: Eva Fahidi, 90, holds a picture of her family, who were all killed in the concentration camp during World War Two, as she poses for a portrait in Budapest. Fahidi was 18 in 1944 when she and her family were moved from Debrecen to Auschwitz-Birkenau

During the Warsaw Uprising, when Mrs Sobczynska was 10-years-old, she was sent with her mother and brother from their home to a camp in Pruszkow and then moved by train to Auschwitz-Birkenau. There they were separated into blocks for woman, girls and boys. Sobczynska said that she was robbed of her childhood, and lost the chance to experience a different kind of life

Long walk: Henryk Duszyk, 80, was 10-years-old during the Warsaw Uprising in August, 1944. He was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau with his father, brother and stepmother.

Auschwitz was the site of one of the largest mass murders in history, with around 1.1million murdered in its grounds - including Jews, gypsies, Poles and the disabled. 

Located in southern Poland, Auschwitz initially served as a detention center for political prisoners, but it evolved into a network of camps where Jewish people and other perceived enemies of the Nazi state were exterminated, often in gas chambers, or used as slave labor.

Some prisoners were also subjected to barbaric medical experiments led by Dr Josef Mengele, also known as The Angel Of Death, including 80-year-old Danuta Bogdaniuk-Bogucka, who was ten years old when she was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. 

Jews were sent to Auschwitz from all over Europe, but a majority came from Poland and Hungary. Imre Varsanyi, 86, from Budapest, was 14 years old when he and his family arrived. He was the only member of his family to survive. After the war Varsanyi did not talk about Auschwitz for 60 years because he felt ashamed of having survived.

Near the end of January 1945, Nazi camp commanders facing the Soviet army's rapid advance abandoned their plans to destroy Auschwitz, leaving dozens of barracks standing, and the twisted concrete-and-steel remains of gas chambers that were only half-destroyed by dynamite.

They drove 60,000 prisoners on a death march that lasted weeks; almost a quarter died.

Soldiers from the Soviet First Ukrainian Front fought their way to the gates of Auschwitz-Birkenau on 27 January, 1945 and found less than 6,000 prisoners still alive in the camp.

Nearby, at the Monowitz slave labour camp they discovered 600 more, and at Auschwitz main camp a further 1,000.

Around 300 people who endured the nightmare of Auschwitz will gather this month at the site, now a museum, to remember the dead and their own liberation.

Angel of Death: Danuta Bogdaniuk-Bogucka, 80, was 10-years-old when she was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau camp with her mother. Mrs Bogdaniuk-Bogucka was part of Josef Mengele's experiments when she was in Auschwitz. After the war she met her mother again and they discovered they had both been at Ravensbruck camp at the same time, but they had not realised this

His father's son: Laszlo Bernath, 87, poses for a portrait in Budapest. Bernath credits his father being a practical man with his survival of Auschwitz. He was 15 when they were taken but his father told him to lie about his age so that they would not be separated. Even whilst in the camp, Bernath had no idea about the gas chambers

Victims of the Holocaust: Mr Bernath holds up a picture of his mother and sisters  who were all killed in the concentration camp

The lucky runaway: Jerzy Ulatowski, 83, was taken by train to Auschwitz-Birkenau when he was 13-years-old. In January 1945 he managed to escape with his family, as there was a lack of power in the barbed wire surrounding the camp

War and pain: Erzsebet Brodt, 89, left and right holding a picture of her family who all died in the camps, was 17-years-old when she was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau along with her family. Remembering the journey to the camp she said that those who were 'sick or about to give birth were forced out and put into one wagon. When the wagon was opened in Auschwitz we saw that everyone was dead inside.'
