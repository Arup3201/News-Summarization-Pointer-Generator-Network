Furious Tories have accused Commons Speaker John Bercow of deliberately helping Labour to take on David Cameron after the Prime Minister was rebuked during Commons clashes.

Mr Cameron could barely contain his anger after after his attacks on Labour’s union links and NHS record was interrupted by Mr Bercow, who told him to ‘remember the essence’ of each question.

The government’s deputy chief whip Greg Hands later claimed Mr Bercow had extended Prime Minister’s Questions to allow more Labour MPs to attack the government, a suggestion backed up by Number 10.

Clash: Prime Minister David Cameron appeared visibly angry at the latest public rebuke from Commons Speaker John Bercow

Conservatives have grown increasingly tired of Mr Bercow’s apparent bias during high profile Commons debates, privately claiming he does little to hide his favouritism towards Labour.

Two weeks ago it emerged senior Tory MPs were planning  to make an unprecedented formal complaint to Mr Bercow over what they see as his bias and ‘hatred’ for Conservatives.

During today’s PMQs, Labour MP John Cryer challenged Mr Cameron over discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace, and plans to charge people £1,200 to go to industrial tribunals.

He then accused Mr Cameron of having an ‘attack of the Lyntons’ - a reference to Tory strategist Lynton Crosby - by talking about ‘dreadful trade unionists’.

Mr Cryer added: ‘I would just like to make it clear that I am a trade unionist and damn proud of it.’

Mr Cameron used the remark to turn his fire on Labour’s union links, and reports that Unite officials targeted the families of bosses from the Grangemouth oil refinery.

The Prime Minister said: ‘I think there are millions of people in this country who can be very proud of being trade unionists.

‘The problem is that they are led so badly by bully-boys, they are led so badly by people who seem to condone intimidating families, intimidating witnesses and intimidating the leader of the opposition (Ed Miliband).’

With heckling almost drowning him out,
Mr Bercow cut Mr Cameron off abruptly. He said: ‘Actually, I think the 
question was about tribunals. It's a good idea to try and remember the 
essence of the question that was put.’

Mr
Cameron was appeared visibly angry at the rebuke, and minutes later 
returned fire during an exchange over the performance of poor 
schoolchildren.

With Mr Bercow apparently eager to intervene again and move on, Mr Cameron told him bluntly:

Mr Cameron added: ‘There are fewer workless households - I am keen to answer the question Mr Speaker and it's a very direct answer.’

His thinly-veiled challenge to authority of the Speaker was cheered by Tory MPs.

Earlier Mr Cameron's attack on Labour's record on running the NHS was also cut short by the Speaker, as he told the Commons: 'I’m not going to take lectures from a government who had patients drinking out of vases.'

Later Tory deputy chief whip Mr Hand took to Twitter to accuse Mr Bercow of extending Prime Minister's Questions by five minutes to give Labour more time to ask a difficult question.

He tweeted: ‘#PMQs getting like Old Trafford. 5 minutes extra time in the hope that the Reds can score a late equaliser.’

Mr Hands tried to play down the idea he had claimed Mr Bercow was politically biased. He added in a further tweet: ‘Just some contemporary footballing banter.’

However Mr Cameron's official spokesman appeared to support the idea that Prime Minister's Questions was often extended in the same way that Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson would get more added time if they were losing.

The PM's spokesman said: 'As a long suffering Spurs fan I have often recognised Fergie time.'

The latest clash comes only a fortnight after Mr Bercow rebuked Mr Cameron for describing Labour leader Ed Miliband as a ‘conman’, saying the term was ‘unparliamentary’.

He was also seen to smirk when the 
Prime Minister stood to speak early by mistake. Backbenchers said he 
permitted ‘a wall of noise’ from Labour, while turning on a handful of 
Tory hecklers.

Mr Bercow has repeatedly clashed with high-profile Tory MPs in the Commons.

Last year he launched a prolonged attack on then-health minister Anna Soubry's.

Mr Bercow bellowed at Ms Soubry three times in just 90 minutes, branding her behaviour in the Commons as ‘totally unacceptable’.

Ex-minister Simon Burns also crossed the Speaker after describing him as a 'stupid, sanctimonious dwarf’ during a Commons row.
