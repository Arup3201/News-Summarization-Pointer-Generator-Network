More than £5billion of revenue is 'at risk' because wealthy investors are ploughing money into film finance schemes to avoid tax, it emerged today.

The partnerships can act as a big incentive for investors to support film projects, but also allow them to use any losses to offset taxes on other income.

HM Revenue & Customs yesterday confirmed it was investigating 600 such schemes over concerns billions was being lost in tax revenue.

Dodging tax: One investment scheme, which bought the rights to films including 1408 starring Samuel L Jackson, is helping 75 members avoid £18million in tax by switching their liabilities to Luxembourg, it has been claimed

The revelations came as David Cameron branded comedian Jimmy Carr 'morally wrong' for using a 'very dodgy' off-shore scheme to pay as little as one per cent income tax.

After paying into a partnership tax-free, investors can take out a loan from the scheme – also tax-free.

In theory the tax break is deferred until the partnership makes money, but some schemes offer the chance to avoid this.

One film investment scheme called Terra Nova is helping 75 members avoid £18million in tax by switching their liabilities to Luxembourg, it has been claimed.

One senior HMRC offical told The Times: 'Film schemes are a £5billion risk for us at least.

'Someone puts in money and then the film scheme promoter says "We're going to lend you ten times that"... so all you do is generate tax relief and make a shedload of money for nothing.'

However, the tax relief is only deferred as any tax saved in the first year is expected to be returned as the film partnership starts to make money in the following years.

Terra Nova investors claimed about £22million in tax relief in 2006 after buying the rights to films including 1408 starring Samuel L Jackson for arund £48million.

They were due to pay back £18million in the next tax year, but were offered the chance to 'retire' from the partnership and move all liabilities to a Luxembourg-based company.

According to Alastair McEwan, of Rebus Solutions, which represents people who believe they were missold investment schemes, says, although legal, such exit schemes are systemic and could cost the Exchequer millions.

Terra Nova was set up by Tim Levy, the founder of Future Capital Partners (FCP).

Lawyers for FCP said restructuring in partnerships could happen for various reasons and that it did not make decisions on behalf of its partners.

Yesterday, Mr Cameron said revelations about the multi-millionaire comedian's tax arrangements suggested Mr Carr is undertaking 'straightforward tax avoidance'.

The PM's extraordinary broadside came as it emerged Carr paid cash for an £8.5million house in one of London’s most fashionable areas.

Speaking to ITV News during his trip to Mexico, the Prime Minister attacked wealthy people who use off-shore schemes to dodge big tax bills.

He said: 'I think some of these schemes - and I think particularly of the Jimmy Carr scheme - I have had time to read about and I just think this is completely wrong.

'There is nothing wrong with people planning their tax affairs to invest in their pension and plan for their retirement - that sort of tax management is fine.

'But some of these schemes we have seen are quite frankly morally wrong.'
