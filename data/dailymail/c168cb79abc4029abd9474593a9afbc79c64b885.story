BBC staff haven't quite got used to how much viewers can see going on in the newsroom through the glass wall at the back of their new 24-hour news studio, it seems.

Complaints have been rolling in about the journalists seen in the background of news broadcasts chomping bananas, chatting, yawning, stretching, picking their noses and even flirting and playfighting in their new open-plan office at London's Broadcasting House.

Comments on social media websites have picked up on the antics of staff in the Corporation's multi-million 
pound 'fish bowl' newsroom since it 
moved from its previous home in Television Centre in March.

One licence fee-payer Mike Jennings expressed despair on Twitter when he spotted employees mucking about as a serious news story was being broadcast.

He tweeted: 'Man talking gravely about floods on BBC News, Adults in background pretending their umbrellas are lightsabers.'

Another viewer, Mark Hutchings, was distracted by a public display of affection between staff while an interview was taking place in the foreground.

He tweeted: 'Surgeon on BBC News 
Channel from Southampton newsroom. In the background two journalists are
 hugging. I know it’s Friday but...'

A
 fellow viewer added: 'Wow BBC News your new newsroom background to the 
newsreader is WAY too visually distracting! We don’t need to see all 
your employees at once.'

And the Beeb's employees have also been forced to cringe over the side-effects of their new workplace conditions.

Journalist Lee Thompson tweeted: 'My bald spot just been shining brightly in the background behind legendary Sir Harold Evans on BBC News Channel. The shame.'

Staff have previously labelled their new offices a 'bear pit' and complained that they feel like 'pandas in a zoo'.

Some even called for the glass to be 
opaque, predicting - correctly, as it turns out - that inappropriate 
behaviour would be caught on camera as tragic and harrowing stories were
 being discussed in the studio.

Broadcasting House, located in Portland Place and Langham Place in the centre of the capital, has became the sole headquarters of the BBC when its 50-year-old White City home closed.

The ultra-modern extension to the famous 1932 art-deco building was designed by architect Sir Richard MacCormac.

But MacCormac was fired by the BBC after a row over funding and another firm was brought in to complete the extension.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Our newsroom is designed to showcase the best of the BBC’s journalism and to enable teams from all platforms to work together more collaboratively and efficiently. Staff are aware that they should behave appropriately.'
