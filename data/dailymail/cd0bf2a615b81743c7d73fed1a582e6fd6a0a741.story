A Swiss music teacher charged with infecting 16 people with HIV by injecting them with needles contaminated by the virus has been arrested after he refused to go to court.

The 54-year-old man, who is not being named in accordance with Swiss law, is said to have told his patients, many of them his music students, that he could 'heal' them with acupuncture.

Police stormed his flat in the Swiss capital Bern after he stopped attending his trial and instead barricaded himself at home.

The self-proclaimed healer's flat in the
 capital Bern was surrounded by police marksmen after he came out 
brandishing two samurai swords.

He failed to appear at his trial on 
Thursday citing 'acute mental and physical exhaustion'.

Police who visited his home on Friday managed 
to hit him with pepper spray in the garden before he ran and
 barricaded himself inside, issuing repeated threats.

Swiss police said they subsequently stormed the man's home and arrested him. An unidentified woman with him was also arrested.

The man had been free on bail since August. His trial began on March 6, but he stopped turning up in court on Thursday.

The case came to the attention of the Swiss authorities after an HIV-positive patient told a Bern hospital in 2004 he had traced his infection back to acupuncture treatments carried out by the accused.

After two more people were diagnosed with HIV and found to have links to the man, detectives investigated and charged the man with infecting 16 'patients' with HIV-tainted blood between 2001 and 2005.

The court in Bern heard that the man conned his pupils into believing he was an acupuncture specialist and said he could 'heal' them with various problems.

The court heard that all 16 people injected by the man, who is not HIV-positive, have 
contracted the AIDS virus.

One of them told the court he visited the 
'healer' in a bid to cure his epilepsy and migraine attacks.

'I know he gave me the virus because 
there is no other way I could have contracted it - not sex, drugs or a 
blood transfusion,' the victim said.

Prosecutors say the blood used by the man came from another of his pupils but he denies the allegation.

The man, who faces life imprisonment if found guilty, has denied the charges.
