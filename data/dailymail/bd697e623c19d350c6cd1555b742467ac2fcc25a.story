A college student was in intensive care with multiple broken bones after he ran and jumped from the roof of an apartment complex towards a swimming pool below - but landed on the concrete.

Ian Smith, a sophomore at Colorado State University, was captured on cameraphone as he stood on the roof of the building during a party on Saturday afternoon.

As other students screamed out for him not to jump, Smith threw himself off and landed with a sickening thud at the edge of the pool - before rolling into the water.

Smith, who does not live in the apartment block, was said to have been drinking before the stunt.

His brother said he had suffered broken ankles, heels and multiple vertebrae in his lower back after the fall from which emergency crews said he was lucky to be alive. Students reported seeing a pool of blood.

Jared Roberts, who lives in the house that Smith scaled, told 9 News: 'You could hear him hit it, and just kinda rolled into the pool.'

Students helped drag the badly injured Smith from the pool before an ambulance took him to Medical Center of the Rockies in 
Loveland.

Students had been celebrating Cinco de Mayo at the Ram's Village Apartments in Fort Collins close to the university campus which offers students two heated pools, a gym, basketball and volleyball courts.
