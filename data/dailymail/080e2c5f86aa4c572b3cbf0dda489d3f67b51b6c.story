The sister of one of the three British men jailed yesterday for drugs offences in Dubai has insisted her brother is innocent – and says she has proof that he was  tortured by police.

Davena Kumar, whose brother Suneet Jeerh was sentenced to four years in prison, said:  ‘I know my brother was tortured – I’ve seen  the marks.’

Mr Jeerh, 25, was arrested last July with Grant Cameron, also 25, and Karl Williams, 26, while on holiday in the Gulf state after synthetic cannabis, known as ‘spice’, was found in their car.

Defence: Davena Kumar says her brother Suneet Jeerh is innocent of drug possession

Beaten: Davena said that she saw the marks from her brother's torture

They have now been found guilty at Dubai’s criminal court of possessing, taking and intending to distribute illegal drugs.

There were fears they could be jailed
for 15 years but the more serious supply charges were dropped. But Mr 
Cameron and Mr Williams, from Wanstead, East London, and Mr Jeerh, from 
Ilford, Essex, claim they were tortured into confessing.

They say police held guns to their heads and one of the men had electric shocks to his genitals.

Prime Minister David Cameron has 
expressed concern over the torture allegations and pledged to raise 
their case during a visit to the UK this week by the president of the 
United Arab Emirates.

Miss Kumar said her brother would 
appeal his sentence, adding: ‘He is innocent, he is not guilty. All 
those charges will be dropped. I originally found out about the torture 
from a friend and I just started screaming. I couldn’t believe any human
could do that.

‘They dragged my brother from his 
apartment, kicking and punching him. They handcuffed him so he couldn’t 
move and punched and electrocuted him with a cattle prod.

‘His whole spine was electrocuted 
quite badly. Even now you can see where his back is still not the same.’
She added: ‘They used the back of the gun to smash him on the head and 
cut him. I was there last week and saw his head open.

‘That was ten months later, so it shows the severity.’

Miss Kumar also spoke of her 
brother’s mental turmoil during his ordeal, saying: ‘He was happy and 
always positive and never negative, but this has changed him 
completely . He’s isolated in a prison where no one speaks English.’

Before yesterday’s hearing, Mr 
Cameron said from behind bars: ‘They Tasered my torso three times in the
police car. It was unbelievably painful.

‘I still cannot believe this is  
happening. I have shared a cell with murderers and fraudsters. It was 
scary in the beginning but you get used to it.

David Cameron has spoken about his 'concern' over the treatment of the three men while in custody

‘I am just trying to keep out of trouble and stay away from fights.’

Mr Cameron’s mother Tracy, who has 
called for an independent inquiry, said Mr Williams was ‘laid out on the
bed, his trousers were stripped down and electric shocks were 
administered to his testicles while he was blindfolded’. She added: ‘I 
believe all boys had guns held to their head – they were told they were 
going to die.’

The legal rights charity Reprieve said the men were forced to sign documents in Arabic and the statements were used as evidence.

It said there is physical evidence to
support the torture claims and a medical examination of the men would 
also provide evidence.

Authorities in the UAE claim the allegations were investigated and are untrue.
