Last month he became an internet star when his father shared a video online of himself dressing up as Spiderman to surprise his son on his fifth birthday. 

Yesterday his parents paid tribute to the child they described as 'the most inspiring person ever'.  

Writing on the family's Facebook page, Mike Wilson said: 'Late on Christmas Eve, Jayden Died peacefully in his sleep, warm in his bed. 

'He looked so relaxed with a very subtle grin on his face. We believe he waited to be out of hospital to be with his family in the most safest place he knew. 

'Jayden had such a happy life. What an incredible 5 years. Jayden to us, is the most inspiring person ever, fighting this tumor with all his might. 

'We now remember Jayden as that cheeky little chappy, always smiling, playing with his favourite toys, on his scooter, enjoying school, and playing with his friends. 

'We will never forget this little Spartan Warrior.' 

Just hours before his death, the family posted a photograph expressing their joy at spending Christmas together.
