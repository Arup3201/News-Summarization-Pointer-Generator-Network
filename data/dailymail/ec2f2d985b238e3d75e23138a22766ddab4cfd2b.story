When you go to an agricultural show it is highly likely that you will see some cattle.

But the Duchess of Cornwall possibly did not expect to find herself talking to one.

Especially one with a sign reading ‘Free hugs’ taped to its belly.

Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, left, asked Lucy Pulsford, right, whether or not she was being fed while dressed in her cow costume at the Royal Bath and West Show in Somerset

Camilla ended up deep in conversation with the black-and-white cow – in reality, 19-year-old Lucy Pulsford in a fluffy but less than convincing costume – as she visited the Royal Bath and West Show in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, yesterday.

The Duchess stroked the cow costume ears,
 asking the teenager 'How long do you have to stay in there?' and 'Are 
they feeding you?'.

The encounter took place in the young 
farmers' club tent and the Duchess, who is president of the Royal Bath 
and West Society, went on to tour the cattle and livestock rings, the 
Farming for the Family stands and the food halls.

The Duchess also met farmers affected by the severe floods at the start of the year.

Unfortunately for the organisers of the Royal Bath and West show in Somerset, the weather was quite wintery

As she walked around, Camilla accepted 
the offer to try some ciders, and in the blind test picked one with a 
name close to home - Harry's Cider - as her favourite.

For her 
efforts trying tipples from the West Country she was given a badge, 
which she proudly wore, that said "I am a cider judge".

Prince Charles, meanwhile, was in Romania, where he toured a medieval church in Transylvania.

Charles is said to be descended from Vlad the Impaler, the bloodthirsty ruler who inspired Dracula.
