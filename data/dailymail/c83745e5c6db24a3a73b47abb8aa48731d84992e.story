Pamela Young has condemned 'soft touch' justice after judges upheld a four-year sentence for Lewis Gill, 21, who killed her son with a single punch

The mother of an Asperger’s sufferer killed with one punch condemned the ‘soft touch’ justice system that has upheld his attacker’s short sentence.

Andrew Young, 40, died after Lewis Gill smashed him in the face in an unprovoked attack.

Yesterday the Court of Appeal ruled Gill’s four-year term was not unduly lenient even though the 21-year-old is likely to serve just half of that.

The decision sparked public anger and Mr Young’s mother Pamela said it showed criminals were not being held to account.

The 71-year-old added: ‘In this country people can get away with anything, not through the police, but through the courts.

‘My sympathies are with the police who do a brilliant job. The police have done their duty but the judicial system hasn’t. The judicial system is a soft touch.

‘I didn’t think it was justice for Andrew at the time but it’s now gone to the highest court in the land. If the highest court says that’s OK then I respect that.

‘It’s best not to have any revenge. If you have revenge in your mind the only person you will hurt is yourself.’

Asked if justice would had been served with a longer term, she said: ‘I suppose it would. It won’t bring Andrew back.’

Her son, who had a mental age of 14, was attacked in a Bournemouth street last November 6 when he challenged Gill’s friend for riding his bicycle on the pavement.

Gill, a convicted robber and trained boxer, turned back and punched Mr Young square in the face.

He fell backwards, fracturing his skull, and died the next day in Southampton Hospital with his mother at his side. The horrifying incident was caught on CCTV.

Gill was given a four-year sentence in February after admitting manslaughter.

But, following dozens of complaints, Attorney General Dominic Grieve referred the sentence to the Court of Appeal. Yesterday he told the court the term did not reflect the extent of Gill’s ‘gratuitous, unprovoked violence’.

But three senior judges disagreed. Lord Justice Treacy said it was ‘within the reasonable range available to the trial judge’.

However he added: ‘We readily understand that this is the sort of case that arouses public concern.

'If there are public concerns going beyond this case then it may well be appropriate for the wider issue to be the subject of detailed consideration and consultation by the Sentencing Council.

‘It is open to the Secretary of State for Justice or other interested bodies to invite the Sentencing Council to do so.’

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling immediately announced a full review.

He told the Daily Mail: ‘I want to ensure that everyone can have full confidence in the sentencing of these crimes, which is why I am asking the Sentencing Council to look at whether further guidance is necessary. 

The death of Andrew Young (left) prompted a review after a string of complaints, but three senior judges yesterday upheld the decision at the Court of Appeal meaning killer Gill (right0 could be released in two years

‘Manslaughter is an extremely serious offence that already carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Compared to five years ago, the average sentence length for this offence has increased by almost 50 per cent.’

Baroness Newlove of Warrington, who is the victims’ commissioner, said: ‘This was a horrific act of violence and my heart truly goes out to Andrew’s family and friends.’

Only a day after the case gained widespread publicity, Gill’s mother dismissed her son’s crime as ‘no big deal’.

Sherron O’Hagan said she did not know ‘what all the fuss was about’ and claimed her son was a ‘good kid’.

Speaking from her home in Sutton, south London, she claimed the death was an ‘accident’ and would ‘all be forgotten tomorrow’.
