These pictures prove how the memory of Communist dictator Josef Stalin is still celebrated in the former Soviet republic of Georgia as supporters turned out to mark the 133rd anniversary of his birth.

Residents of mountain village Zemo Alvani reinstated a three metre monument to the dictator who they credit with defeating the Nazis in World War Two.

The
statue was removed a year ago after President 
Mikheil Saakashvili said the late dictator was too closely associated 
with what he called the 'Soviet occupation of Georgia' and called for 
memorials to Stalin to be dismantled.

Georgia's new government of billionaire 
Bidzina Ivanishvili wants to improve relations with Russia and said it did 
not oppose its reinstatement.

It also said it would pay for the 
restoration of a Stalin monument in Gori, the Georgian city most 
affected by the 2008 war that saw Moscow recognise the two breakaway 
regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states.

Zemo Alvani resident Phatima 
Patishvili, said: 'I
came here because I love Stalin and I love my people. I remember when I
was 12 how my grandmother was weeping when Stalin died.'

In Moscow, hundreds of Russian 
Communists led by their leader Gennady Zuyganov laid flowers at Stalin's
grave at the Red Square on Friday, while smaller rallies were held across 
Russia and several former Soviet republics.

Stalin critics  also made their mark on the anniversary.

In southern Ukraine, several ethnic Crimean Tatars trashed a small street exhibition on Stalin.

The entire Crimean Tatar population of Ukraine was hastily deported in cattle trains on Stalin's orders in 1944 for their alleged collaboration with Nazi Germans during World War II.

Of the 200,000 Crimean Tatars, almost a fifth died of starvation and diseases, and the survivors were allowed to return only in the late 1980s.

Critics of the Stalin regime hold him responsible for the.he deaths of at least 724,000 people during the purges and repression of the 1930s, while millions died as a result of the forced labor system in Gulags, the Soviet prison system.

While supporters believe he was a strong and valiant leader whose grip on the nation was needed for security and his popularity in Russia has been climbing amid Kremlin-backed efforts to defend his image.
