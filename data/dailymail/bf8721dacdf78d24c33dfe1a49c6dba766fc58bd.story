Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain has admitted that Lionel Messi discussed him joining Barcelona this summer, but added that a move to the Nou Camp was never on the cards.

The Argentina star was heavily linked with the Catalan giants by the Spanish press in June, with Marca claiming that a deal was 'very close' to being completed.

But after Barca splashed out £75million on Luis Suarez from Liverpool, Higuain looks set to remain in Serie A with Rafa Benitez's side.

Going nowhere: Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain has admitted his Argentina team-mate Lionel Messi spoke to him about a move to Barcelona this summer

No chance: Higuain says he'll remain at Napoli, despite wanting to play alongside his friend Messi at club level

Speaking to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the 26-year-old said: 'Did I want to go to Barcelona? I always told the truth and that is that I wanted to think only of the World Cup and then I would return to Napoli.

'So I kept quiet and I had nothing to fear, because there was nothing to comment about 

'Messi said certain things and I can only be flattered by them. I believe that every player would love to play alongside a great champion like him, but that does not mean that I ever wanted to leave.'

Higuain only joined Napoli from Real Madrid last summer, but he already has one eye on a reunion with a former rival.

The ex-River Plate man joked: 'But if Messi came to Napoli, that would be great.'
