Two women pulled each others hair, scratched and drew blood during a fight outside a court in Belfast.

The violent altercation began after the unidentified pair, who are thought to have known each other, clashed outside Laganside Court in the Northern Irish capital.

A security guard had to step in to separate the two women, who had each other in a fierce hold, before court staff escorted one inside for her own protection.

Fierce: The older woman pulled on the other females hair during the violent altercation

Pain: The red-haired woman tries to wriggle away from the grasp of the attacker

Grab: The older woman goes for the throat of the mother, who was looking after her baby at the time

One of the women, said to be in her 20s, was walking her young child in a pram alongside a male friend who allegedly shouted 'I am going to stamp on your son's head' to the other woman, said to be in her 40s.

The older woman then ran over, grabbed her younger opponent and began to pull her hair.

She then managed to draw blood before a security guard was forced to drag the pair apart.

A witness outside the court said: 'One of the women was in her 40's and the other was in her 20's, it looked like they knew each other.

'The woman with the red hair had a pram with a young baby inside.

'A man she was with then shouted something like "I am going to stamp on your son's head".

Hold: A security guard was forced to intervene and managed to separate the pair

Injury: The red-haired woman was escorted into the court building with blood dripping from her eyebrow

Gesture: The woman pointed at her opponent as she walked away from the scene

'It was all over very quickly, security guards rushed in to break them up.'

An ambulance was called to the scene, but the women had left before it arrived.

Photographers captured the scrap while they covered the case of  Marian McGlinchey, the Old Bailey bomber.

A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland confirmed there had been an incident and added that inquiries were continuing.

It is not known whether either individual was involved in any criminal proceedings within the court.
