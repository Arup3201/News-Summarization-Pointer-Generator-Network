Al-Qaeda's Twitter account has now been suspended.

After going live Tuesday under the guise of its Shamukh al-Islam website, the official website of the terror organization, the @shomokhalislam account was suspended Sunday after just under 50 tweets.

The account’s suspension came only hours after a report critical of Twitter remaining silent as to why it was allowed to remain online for so long

Terrifying: al-Qaeda has started its own Twitter account

First reported Friday by the Washington Free Beacon, the terror group's account was open less than a week before Twitter pulled the plug.

The decision to take down Shamukh al-Islam's Twitter came only hours after TheBlaze reported the site was remaining silent on why the account was still up.

'We don’t comment on individual Twitter accounts, for security and privacy reasons,' Twitter spokesperson Nu Wexler told MailOnline.

Mr Wexler then referred to the site's rules barring targeted abuse or harassment as likely reasons why @shomokhalislam was suspended as it grew increasingly bolder, tweeting updates about attacks, and even justifications for them.

The Twitter account was not locked or kept private, and its followers appear mostly to be journalists and curious gawkers. The website administering it is closed to the public.

Some of the postings, translated to English, were accounts of operations. Others were religious decrees and links to statements on the Shamukh al-Islam website and YouTube videos.

'Dear Brothers, the Mujahideen today are going through a period of great scrutiny and trial Be them good Nassara, and certain after God,’ read one tweet.

'Peshawar from New burn under the feet of the servants of worshipers of the cross, the explosive device was detonated now targeting Bus least the staff of the Ministry of Interior of Pakistan in Peshawar,' read another, before giving a death toll of 17, with 35 injured in the attack.

'The attack killed more than 17 people dead and inflicted 35 wounded in the initial toll expected to rise .. Source Brother Fadil Abu Maaz Kouhati,' said the most recent tweet sent from the account.

Had it been allowed to remain online, it likely would have been subject to intense intelligence community scrutiny.

Prior to the account's suspension, terror analysts speculated it was likely a shift in strategy for the notoriously cryptic terror group.

Despite
 well-known power struggles among different al-Qaeda factions, the 
Twitter account's administrator had pledged to remain neutral and focus 
on spreading the terror group's message, according to the Times.

‘We’ve seen terrorist groups make 
increasingly effective use of social media, particularly Twitter and 
Facebook, in recent years,’ Patrick Poole, a counterterrorism expert, 
told the Washington Times.

‘Not only is this important for propaganda purposes but also recruitment,' he added.

It also may have allowed al-Qaeda the capability to streamline distribution of directives or celebratory announcements.

'If the dissemination of official releases is no longer to be done centrally, it has the potential to make the forums obsolete and usher in a new era whereby jihadi activists primarily rely on social media platforms to interact with one another,' Aaron Zelin, a counterterrorism analyst, told the Times.

No reason has been given for the account's suspension, but one only needs to look at why the site suspended al-Shabaab's account multiple times during the Kenyan mall seige.

The al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorists also violated rules pertaining to threatening behavior or violence.
