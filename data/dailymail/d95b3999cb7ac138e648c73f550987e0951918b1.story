The sun piercing a snow-covered landscape has been captured beautifully in these photos by Polish photographer Jakub Polomski.

The intrepid traveller ascended the summit of Aiguille du Midi in the French Alps, a height of some 3,842m and often seen as a starting point before taking on Mont Blanc.

And of course, his camera became useful once at the top.

The first day atop the Aiguille du Midi brought a bright sun, warm weather and no wind

But the second day was all change for Polomski when the wind picked up making conditions tough to battle through

The cable car, believed to be the highest in the world, climbs more than 2,700m

Speaking to boredpanda.com, Polomski said: 'You can easily get there by cable car. It was built in 1955 and for about two decades was claimed to be the highest cable car in the world.

'Aiguille du Midi is one of the best tourist attractions in French Alps. It is also a start point for mountain climbers who desire to climb Mont Blanc. 

'I visited the place twice and experienced different weather conditions up there.'

The first day of Polomski's challenge saw him experience agreeable conditions atop the Chamonix mountain, the weather was warm and sunny, with little wind.

However the second day things took a turn for the worse, it snowed heavily and the wind picked up making it bitterly cold.

Jakub Polomski has photographed some exhilarating landscapes in the world

Polomksi's love for the earth's beautiful and often mysterious landscape has seen him travel to Argentina and Chile, as well as Slovakia, France and Norway among others.

He described his time viewing the Queens of Andes in Chile as 'the most beautiful national park,' while earlier this year he photographed one of the biggest glaciers in the world in Argentina, the Perito Moreno.
