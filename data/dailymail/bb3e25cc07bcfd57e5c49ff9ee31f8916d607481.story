A 29-year-old woman and a two-year-old boy have been shot dead and their neighbor has been critically injured in a shooting at a mobile home park in Washington state, authorities have said. 

Heather Kelso and Kaden Lum, the young son of Kelso's roommate, were gunned down by an unidentified suspect at their home  in Bremerton, Kitsap County, in the early hours of Saturday.

Kaden's mother was desperately trying to shield her son from the gunman when he was shot, it is reported. She was not hurt in the gunfire and later told police that she did not know the attacker.

One of the family's neighbors, a man whose age is unknown, was visiting the property at the time of the attack at Kariotis Mobile Home Park. He was shot in the lower abdomen as he fled the scene.

When sheriff's deputies arrived at the park, the man was airlifted to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle with life-threatening injuries. He remains in a critical condition and has undergone surgery.

Within minutes of the shooting unfolding, emergency crews had rushed to the scene in McWilliams Road NE. There, they found Kelso, an employee of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, unresponsive.

She was declared dead at the site. Kaden, who was also found unconscious at the mobile home, was transported to Harrison Medical Center in Bremerton. But despite medics' best efforts, he later died.

On Saturday morning, investigators were seen scouring the mobile home park with a police dog in a bid to find the attacker. However, the canine did not pick up a scent,The Kitsap Sun reported.

'We feel confident the suspect is no longer in the mobile home park,' Kitsap County Sheriff's Lt. Detective Earl Smith told reporters shortly after the shooting, which occurred at around 2am. 

Kelso had lived in the mobile home park for three years when she was gunned down, the sheriff said. Kaden and his mother had lived with her for just three weeks, according to the newspaper.

The sheriff's office did not release the boy's mother's name. Kaden's father lives outside Kitsap County, Smith said. Two other homes were hit with bullets, but no one was hurt, he added.

Bremerton is on the west side of Puget Sound, across from Seattle. A GoFundMe page has now been set up to raise money to help cover Kaden's funeral costs. To donate, click here.
