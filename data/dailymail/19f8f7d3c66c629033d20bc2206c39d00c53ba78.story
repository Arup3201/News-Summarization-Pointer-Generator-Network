Jack Wilshere is on the hunt for a new agent right now and in the discussions he has had so far he is said to be making certain demands.

He wants to know how much money he will make beyond his playing contract at Arsenal:   endorsement deals and such like.

And he wants an assurance that any agreement comes with a job for his older brother, Tom, having secured him a position with his previous management company.

Jack's shame: Former Arsenal masseur Kieran Hunt pours champagne into Wilshere's mouth in Las Vegas

Controversy: The England midfielder was seen smoking a cigar and cigarettes given to him by his brother

It’s Tom in the photograph that appeared on the back page of the Daily Mail earlier this week; Tom who appears to be holding a cigarette to his sublimely gifted sibling’s mouth as they enjoy themselves at a pool party in Las Vegas.

Never mind that it was only a few days before pre-season training resumed at Arsenal. Never mind that competition for places in the Gunners midfield has rarely appeared more intense.

It’s only a cigarette, or a cigar (he was photographed smoking one of those, too), or another cocktail.

Their dad, Andy, was there in Las Vegas, so perhaps we shouldn’t blame Tom.

This might sound like an over-reaction and a bit unfair. For a start, Wilshere is not exactly alone when it comes to elite athletes who enjoy an occasional puff when they spend most of their lives striving for physical perfection.

More worrying in Wilshere’s case is the fact that this is not the first time it has happened and that the 22-year-old midfielder has failed to act after the first incident — when he expressed remorse having been photographed smoking last October — by making sure he does not find himself in the same position again.

It might not have mattered quite so much had Wilshere been reflecting on a marvellous season at Arsenal and a brilliant World Cup.

But he wasn’t. He was reflecting on a mediocre, injury-troubled season amid accusations that his career has stood still these past couple of years.

Paul Scholes said as much on TV and this week his view was echoed by former Arsenal manager George Graham.

‘His career has not gone anywhere in the last 18 months,’ said Graham before suggesting this latest controversy demanded a dressing down from current Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.

And when Wilshere’s own family see no harm in smoking and drinking and there is no agent, at least not at the moment, to pull him into line, it is Wenger’s responsibility to tackle a footballer in danger of wasting his considerable talent.

The evidence would suggest he is capable of squandering the gifts he was blessed with and what we  actually have here is yet another great English footballing talent whose career is undermined by  personality flaws.

Look at Paul Gascoigne. Look, even, at Wayne Rooney. Potential that, for different reasons, is never quite realised.

Some would consider that to be harsh and not just in the case of the sometimes brilliant Rooney. Only recently, senior FA officials were pleased to report how Wilshere had come of age during England’s brief stay in Brazil this summer.

He was said to have been the model professional, applying himself with maturity even when he knew he was excluded from Roy Hodgson’s starting line-up for the opening two group games. 

His colleagues at Arsenal would also report how dedicated Wilshere was in returning to fitness last summer after finally recovering from a troublesome ankle injury.

But in private some of those colleagues have also questioned whether he respects the athletic talent he possesses as much as he should.

Whether he is as professional as he needs to be when the modern game places such huge physical demands on the players.

Arsenal coaching staff, who regard him as a likeable ‘cheeky chappie’, do not feel his game has progressed in the way it should over the past year and it is acknowledged that this season will be an acid test.

There is little doubt he does not respect the position he has as a sporting role model, however  inappropriate it might seem to burden a young man with such responsibility.

‘It’s either arrogance or stupidity but he just doesn’t get it,’ remarked one observer. This week officials at the Emirates Stadium were said to be deeply disappointed by his behaviour.

It has not escaped the attention of the same agents he has been courting that he might not appreciate the role he needs to play in securing endorsement deals.

Potential: Rooney, like Wilshere, broke onto the scene, and into the England team, at a young age

Struggles: Rooney has never quite lived up to the incredible expectations put upon him

Right now he has lucrative  contracts with Nike and Pepsi but blue-chip brands are unlikely to come running after seeing the images from Las Vegas this week.

The detail of Wilshere’s ‘boys’ trip’ is unlikely to impress them, either.  Organised, apparently, around a friend’s stag party at the MGM Grand hotel on the main Las Vegas strip, the trip became more of an England footballer affair when Wilshere discovered Joe Hart and James Milner were also going to be there with friends.

They threw a ‘wet and wild’ party, with Wilshere said to have had champagne poured down his throat by former Arsenal masseur Kieran Hunt — a la Gazza and the ‘dentist’s chair’ in Hong Kong in 1996.

Wilshere is thought to have hired a whole floor of the hotel, with a pool, and guests were asked to surrender their phones so pictures could not be taken: a strategy that did not exactly pay off.

Perhaps Wilshere’s father, a 49-year-old former builder who is fiercely protective of his family, saw no harm in his son letting off a bit of steam.

But when Wilshere already has something of a track record for trouble, maybe he would have been  better advising against a  hedonistic hotspot such as  Las Vegas.

As far back as August 2010, Wilshere was getting into scrapes. He sparked a nightclub brawl by telling a girl to ditch her boyfriend because he and his friends had ‘more money’.

Kimberley Plested broke an elbow when she fell trying to protect boyfriend Dan Farnon as Wilshere’s friends attacked them. 

The PA, celebrating her 21st birthday at the Amika club in Kensington, said Wilshere kept telling her to join his party before a crude sexual remark sparked a fight.

Plested needed metal pins inserted in her arm and Wilshere, who claimed to be the peacemaker in the incident, was given a police caution for common assault while Adam Mardell and Duane Brailsford each pleaded guilty to affray.

Brailsford, who left Farnon with a gashed eye, also admitted assault. The following March, Wilshere hurled insults at taxi driver Brian Spencer, 64, after realising he was a Tottenham fan.

‘Wilshere’s behaviour is the worst I’ve ever seen in all my time as a cabbie,’ said Spencer. ‘No one deserves to be spat at just because of the team they support.

'He was behaving appallingly, but when he noticed my Spurs hat it got a lot worse. He suddenly started calling me every name under the sun.

‘He walked straight up to me and said, “You’re f*****g taking us”, as he pointed to my cab. When I told him he was too drunk he got even more aggressive and started  screaming at me that I should take him and his mates.’

In that instance Wilshere accepted another police caution and apologised for his behaviour.

Wilshere, who now has a young family of his own — a girlfriend and two children — is from a tough, working-class background.

During his formative years he would attend Arsenal’s academy in Hale End and the coaches who worked with him remember what a wonderful young player he was: head and shoulders above other kids his age. He would often play with youngsters two years above his age group.

At that stage he did everything right, focusing on football. The only negative was that his coaches did not think he would be captain material because he wanted the ball too much and was too involved in the game to be able to organise other things.

But they knew as long ago as when he was 13 that he was destined to become an Arsenal player — and an England international.

One of his early coaches believes Wilshere has lost his innocence about only wanting to play football and feels he has been caught up too much in stuff away from the game.

However, the coach claims every talented young player goes through that period and that Wilshere needs to realise what is important.

On one wall at Hale End a photograph has pride of place. It is a teenage Wilshere staring in awe at Diego Maradona.

One only hopes he admires Maradona more for his genius than his own, hell-raising behaviour — and recognises that before Maradona’s fall he enjoyed quite a rise.
