At two years old, Samuel Dymott is too young to realise just how incredibly dear he is to his parents.

He knows they love him. But it will be some time before he comprehends just how much money – and heartache – they invested during the four years they spent trying to have him.

His mother Jo Sharpe had been told by an NHS specialist she would never conceive with her own eggs after blood tests showed she was perimenopausal, meaning she was heading for early menopause.

Happy mum: Jo Sharpe, 38, and her husband Miles Dymott, 42, from Brighton, had son Samuel, pictured aged six months, after several rounds of IVF and alternative treatments costing £60,000

But after she endured two failed rounds of IVF at a private clinic, and countless alternative therapies, Samuel was finally conceived after a third round of IVF.

By then his parents had spent more than £60,000 ensuring his arrival. He was born on March 26, 2012, weighing 9lb 3oz.

Their struggle to become parents has left Miss Sharpe, a recruitment manager, and her husband Miles Dymott, an IT manager, around £20,000 in debt. But Samuel is worth every penny to them.

Miss Sharpe, 38, said: ‘Every day I think how lucky I am to have had my own biological child. It’s such a massive thing for me.’ 

The couple, from Brighton, began trying for a baby soon after marrying. Mr Dymott has a daughter, Aisha, now 13, from a previous relationship but they wanted a child together too.

If the woman is under 35, doctors usually tell couples they cannot have tests until they have tried for 12 months without success to become pregnant.

But after only three months Miss Sharpe, who was 32 at the time, and her husband went to their GP in 2008. ‘I lied and said we’d been trying for a year,’ she said.

It was then that blood tests showed she was heading for early menopause and her only hope was donor eggs or adoption. But she refused to give up hope and threw herself into researching fertility.

After making appointments with a private fertility clinic and a Chinese medicine practitioner, she replaced alcohol, sugar, caffeine and carbohydrates with wheatgrass shots and maca powder, a supplement made from a South African root which is purported to boost energy.

She also tried acupuncture, reflexology, yoga and pilates.

Then came the two unsuccessful rounds of IVF, using her eggs and her husband’s sperm, both in 2009.

Failing to become pregnant was heartbreaking, but Miss Sharpe was determined to try again and found a clinic in London with a different – and more expensive – approach involving more extensive tests. She had to get up at 4.45am to travel to London for daily blood tests before heading back to work, and had 14 days of hormone injections before two embryos were put back into her womb.

The day before she was due to have a pregnancy blood test at the clinic, her husband, now 42, convinced her to take a home pregnancy test. ‘I was too nervous to look at it so I handed it to Miles. When his face lit up I knew it was positive,’ she said.

As for the alternative therapies, she is sceptical about how much they helped her to conceive, but says they gave her a psychological boost.

She also ordered the controversial drug DHEA, a hormone supplement which is thought to boost oestrogen levels, off the internet, but says it gave her boils on her face, chest and back.

The couple used bonuses, overdrafts and credit cards, plus help from her parents, to pay for the ever rising cost of having Samuel.

Since his birth, they have tried for another child and Miss Sharpe has had two more rounds of IVF, costing £10,000 each, boosting their pregnancy bill to a total of £83,200.
