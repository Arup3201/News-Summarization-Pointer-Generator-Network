Roy Hodgson has been forced into a bizarre apology after making a ‘monkey’ joke during his half-time team talk on Tuesday at Wembley.

Hodgson used the joke as he attempted to 
explain to right back Chris Smalling that he wanted to get the ball to 
Andros Townsend more often after the break during the World Cup 
qualifier.

But Townsend tweeted on Thursday morning to insist that 'no offence' had been meant by Hodgson or taken by him.

Apology: England manager Roy Hodgson has apologised for making a joke about a monkey during the team's World Cup qualifier against Poland on Tuesday night

Nonplussed: Andros Townsend tweeted to say there was no offence meant or taken

Defence: Wayne Rooney took to Twitter to stand up for Hodgson

Townsend tweeted: 'I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!'

England’s head coach is believed to have 
upset an unnamed player in the dressing room during the 2-0 win over Poland that 
secured England’s World Cup place.

The FA have confirmed that Hodgson did
make the remarks, but are disappointed that it has been interpreted by 
some as a racial slur or innuendo.

Hodgson said on Wednesday night: ‘I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time.

‘There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate.

‘I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday.

‘He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.’

Clash: The joke came in a half-time team-talk during the crunch game at Wembley Stadium

The joke, which is believed to have been told in full at half-time, is as follows.

‘NASA decided they would finally send a man up in an capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions.

‘They fire the man and the monkey into space.’

‘The intercom crackles “fire the retros”.

‘A little later, “Monkey, check the solid fuel supply’

‘Later still “Monkey, check the life support systems for the man”.

‘The astronaut takes umbrage and radios NASA. “When do I get something”.’

‘NASA replied – in 15 minutes, feed the monkey.’

England’s head coach is furious and 
insists it was an analogy about NASA sending a monkey into space and 
cannot be interpreted in any other way.

Townsend has been spoken to by the FA and insists he has no issue with the joke.

His father Troy works for the Kick It Out campaign and is believed to have discussed the issue with his son.

Hodgson is understood to be distraught
by any attempt to smear his name after successfully leading England to 
the World Cup finals on Tuesday.

Although he is known for lengthy team 
talks to his players at times, Hodgson’s decision to make an attempt to 
tell a joke at the break does seem unusual. The 66-year-old is a man of 
vast experience but is dealing with a much younger dressing-room in a 
modern climate.

Goalscorer Wayne Rooney jumped to 
Hodgson's defence on Thursday morning, he tweeted: 'Seen the story on 
roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.'

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce did not think that it was an issue.

He said: We are a politically correct country and we have to be careful about what we say today. But if we continue to wipe it up and promote everything in the press, nobody will be able to say a word shortly.

'We'll have to keep ourselves quiet and not express opinions. We shouldn't be saying anything wrong but you have to be very careful today. I'm sure with what Roy said he didn't mean any offence or any harm.'

Former England international Stan Collymore, meanwhile, insisted the joke makes no reference to race.

'If Roy has said that phrase in the dressing room then it is in the context of the story,' he told talkSPORT.

'People
are walking on egg shells, worried about everything they say. Why would
the word "monkey" have a racist feel for someone in the dressing room, 
or any player? I can’t see the link, can you?

'We’ve
all got the right to feel offence, but this is really spurious. What 
are you actually offended by? The word "monkey"? I don’t see any 
reference to race. You have to look at the big picture.

'Is
Roy Hodgson, from what we know of him over the last 30-40 years, the 
sort of man to go out of his way to be stupid enough to cause offence? I
would say no.'

Star: The remark came as Hodgson urged players to pass to up-and-coming star Townsend

The row has taken the gloss off 
England’s qualification and came as it was revealed that Hodgson is in 
line for a huge bonus after leading England to Brazil.

If he is successful next summer, the 
cash reward he will receive could touch the £1million mark. Hodgson 
accepted a basic package worth £3m a year when he was released by West 
Bromwich Albion to take the team to Euro 2012 following Fabio Capello’s 
exit.

His salary is less than half the 
Italian’s £6.5m wage during his five-year spell as England manager, but 
there are huge bonuses in the deal.

Hodgson has a number of targets, 
including further incentives for progressing beyond the group stage in 
Brazil. The bonuses for qualifying were put in place before the first 
group game against Moldova last September but the incentives for 
progress next summer will be decided in the new year.

Relief: Hodgson celebrates at Wembley, and is now in line for a big bonus if England do well next summer
