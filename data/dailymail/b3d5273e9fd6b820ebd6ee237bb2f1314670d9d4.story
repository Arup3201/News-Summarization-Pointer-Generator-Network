Angel di Maria finally became a Manchester United player for a British record £59.7million on Tuesday night and immediately claimed he would not have left Real Madrid for any other club.

The Argentinean winger signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford that will net him £6.5m a year after tax. That will put the 26-year-old just behind United captain Wayne Rooney in terms of earnings and takes the club’s investment in the player to beyond the £100m mark.

Di Maria’s suggestion that he would only have left Spain for United will raise eyebrows across town at Manchester City. The defending Barclays Premier League champions were offered the player on exactly the same terms last week.

'I am absolutely delighted to be joining Manchester United,' said Di Maria.

'I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in Spain and there were a lot of clubs interested in me, but United is the only club that I would have left Real Madrid for.

'Louis van Gaal is a fantastic coach with a proven track record of success and I am impressed by the vision and determination everyone has to get this club back to the top – where it belongs. I now just cannot wait to get started.'

Di Maria was not signed in time to travel to Milton Keynes for Tuesday night's Capital One Cup tie but is expected to make his debut at Burnley in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday.

United manager Van Gaal said: 'Angel is a world-class midfielder but most importantly he is a team player. There is no doubting his immense natural talent.

'He is a tremendously fast and incisive left-footed player who puts fear into the most accomplished defence.

'His dribbling skills and his ability to take on and beat opponents are a joy to watch. He is an excellent addition to the team.'

United first looked at Di Maria three years ago when he was a young player at Benfica. Manchester City and Chelsea were also interested at the time.

A sign was put outside the shop on Monday night informing fans that there were no 'R' letters left in black print.

Now, the Champions League winner is one of the most accomplished wide players in the game and it remains to be seen where Van Gaal tries to fit him into his much-discussed 3-4-1-2 system.

Van Gaal and United chief executive Ed Woodward will now turn their attention to recently increased interest in Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal.

United have denied interest in the Chilean all summer but have belatedly got involved in serious discussions, as they have with Ajax over utility player Daley Blind.

Van Gaal’s chief reservation about buying Vidal – who carries a £30m price tag – is his injury record. Knee surgery last season prevented him playing for his club since the end of March and his performances at the World Cup were modest.

Any offer to Vidal by United, therefore, will comprise a lower basic wage than would normally be expected with bonuses built in relating to how many appearances he makes for the club.

Meanwhile, Benfica are showing an interest in United striker Javier Hernandez.
