Ann Summers has been given another high fashion makeover by the acclaimed British designer Giles Deacon, who counts Cara Delevingne as a fan.

The collaboration is the designer's second offering for Ann Summers and the underwear giant describes the new range as 'unapologetically sexy and bold with a dash of naughtiness.' 

Giles Deacon, who worked for Bottega Veneta and Gucci before founding his own label, GILES, in 2003, once said that he 'didn’t design for wallflowers' and this mantra is certainly in evidence in this collection.

One for the Christmas wishlist? The collaboration is the designer's second offering for Ann Summers and the underwear giant describes the new range as 'unapologetically sexy and bold with a dash of naughtiness'

The burlesque-inspired range is packed with detail from erotic peep elements and satin bound boning to wisps of eyelash lace.

Speaking about working with the lingerie giant, Giles said: 'Ann Summers is an iconic brand recognised and loved by so many and which occupies a unique and successful position on the British high street.

'I knew at the start when designing the collection that I wanted it to combine great shapes, thoughtful details and to be of the highest quality that would enable the pieces to be aspirational yet affordable.

Amping up the glamour: New for this season is the Georgette range, which Giles says embodies burlesque naughtiness, updated with a designer touch for the 21st century siren

'I also thought about different women who might be buying these pieces when designing the collection, with different aspects to their personalities whether that’s flirtation, dominance or playfulness - the finished collection enables them to pick and choose and have some fun with all of the ranges as a collection of lingerie that can be the foundation for any outfit or occasion.'

A spokesperson for Ann Summers, said: 'Giles’ collections are sexy yet always have a sense of fun, values that are in line with the Ann Summers brand - as a designer he is not afraid to be daring or to take risks, which is important.'
