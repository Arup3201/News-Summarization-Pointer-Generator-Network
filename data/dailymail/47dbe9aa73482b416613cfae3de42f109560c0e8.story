Tony Abbott has vowed to 'sweat blood' for an Indigenous referendum, but won’t commit to a date until he’s confident it’ll be successful.

The Prime Minister wants a referendum to be held in May 2017, but will not commit to a date.

'I am prepared to sweat blood on this,' the Prime Minister declared at a Recognise dinner at Redfern on Thursday night, saying the cause was 'at least as important as all the other causes this government has been prepared to take on'.

The Age reported that while he favoured setting on the date of May 27, 2017 – the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum – Mr Abbott said: 'But I do not want it to fail because every Australian would be the loser. It is more important to get this right than to try to rush it through.

'We cannot finalise when the referendum should be held until we are comfortable that we have the proposal with the best chance of success.'

There was still some community opposition to the campaign, throwing into doubt a guarantee of success.

Constitutional change must satisfy a majority of the people in a majority of the states.

'It is more important to get this right than to try to rush it through,' Mr Abbott said.

'I do not want it to fail because every Australian would be the loser.'

A parliamentary committee report into constitutional recognition is due in the first quarter of next year.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said it was time for Australia to debate what form of referendum to support, not whether or not it supported recognition.

A question should be settled before the next election and a referendum should follow after.

'Let us assume and believe in Australians that we are capable at last of rectifying this national failure,' the Labor leader told the event.

Mr Shorten stressed there was a lot of work left to be done in deciding the wording for the vote.

But the nation could not afford to be bogged down by a small number of people keen to reboot old weapons of the history wars, nor submit to low expectations.

'We cannot allow ourselves to be put off our stroke by those who propose nothing and contribute nothing,' he said.

Mr Abbott is determined to get the referendum process right than to 'try to rush it through'
