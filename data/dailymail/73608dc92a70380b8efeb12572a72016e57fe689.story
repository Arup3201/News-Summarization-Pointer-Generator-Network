Nine Tory MPs have accepted free tickets to the opera and the Chelsea Flower Show from a giant tobacco company.

Over the past two months alone, politicians took tickets worth almost £17,000 from Japan Tobacco International, which makes Silk Cut, Benson & Hedges, Camel and Old Holborn.

The gifts illustrate the close connections between Conservative Party elements and firms that have lobbied successfully against Government plans for cigarettes to be sold in plain packets.

Complimentary tickets: Japan Tobacco International gave MPs passes to the Chelsea Flower Show that cost between £1,133 and £1,260

Freebies: Four MPs - two Conservative and two Labour - took tickets for last month's Glyndebourne opera festival at a country house in West Sussex

Embarrassingly for the Labour Party, three of its MPs accepted tickets as well.

David Cameron has been accused of dropping the packaging proposals following lobbying from his Australian elections guru Lynton Crosby, whose firm works for global tobacco giant Philip Morris.

Yesterday Paul Burstow, a Lib Dem former health minister, called for Mr Crosby to be sacked.

And Labour’s Cabinet Office spokesman Jon Trickett pledged to lay amendments to a lobbying bill before Parliament this week. These would make senior figures working for politicians come clean about who they lobby for.

The fact JTI is entertaining so many MPs will raise concerns it is trying to buy their support in Parliament.

The Commons register of members’ interests reveals that seven Conservative MPs and one Labour MP accepted tickets for two to the Chelsea Flower Show from JTI in May.

They are Tories Nigel Adams, Oliver Colville, Edward Garnier, Mark Pritchard, Laurence Robertson, Alec Shelbrooke and Angela Watkinson; and Labour’s Lindsay Hoyle.

The MPs gave differing figures for the supposed value of the tickets, varying from £1,133 to £1,260. Mr Adams received Chelsea tickets on two successive days – May 22 and 23 – costing £1,188 and £1,050 plus VAT.

A further four MPs – two Conservative and two Labour – took tickets for last month’s Glyndebourne  opera festival at a country house in West Sussex.

These were Christopher Chope and Bob Walter, both Tories; and Jim Dowd and Gerald Kaufman, both Labour. The listed value for the tickets for two to see the opera Ariadne on Naxos vary from £1,278 to £1,534.

It means that, in just two months, JTI paid out £16,677 in hospitality.

Health campaigners accused Mr Cameron of betrayal on Friday after he ditched pledges to crack down on cigarettes and alcohol.

One charity dubbed it ‘a good day for undertakers’.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that plans to force tobacco firms to sell their products in plain packaging had been shelved indefinitely.

The Prime Minister is facing fresh questions about the role of Mr Crosby, who works for the Conservative Party for only a few days a month leaving him free to devote the rest of his time to his lobbying firm.

Downing Street insisted Mr Crosby ‘had no input into the decision on plain packaging’.

But Mr Burstow told the Observer: ‘Lynton Crosby cannot remain at the heart of government while he is also serving the interests of the tobacco industry. If he does not go, the Prime Minister should sack him.’ 

Plans to introduce a minimum price for alcohol will also be dropped next week, again following a major lobbying campaign. 

Proposals to outlaw multi-buy drinks deals are also set to be shelved amid fears of a public backlash.But ministers will still bring forward plans to ban supermarkets from selling alcohol at below cost.
