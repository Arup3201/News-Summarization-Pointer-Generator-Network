Emotions can often get the better of jubilant relatives during a wedding celebration - but rather than shedding a tear, this grandmother somehow managed to throw her drink over the bride.

The awkward moment, caught on camera, happened as happy couple Darren and Jennifer Nock emerge at their marriage reception in Cornwall to be cheered by guests and showered in confetti.

But in a moment of confusion, Mrs Nock's grandmother threw her glass of Pimm's straight into the face of the bride - instead of her cup of confetti.

Oops: As the bride and groom emerge, a grandmother gets confused and throws her drink instead of confetti

Horror: Guests react in shock as they realise the bride has been doused by the bride's grandmother

Guests put their hands to their mouths in horror, as the bride turns away to try and clean up the mess and remove fruit which went in her eye. 

Aghast, Mrs Nock's grandmother gets understandably upset, but the groom and other guests quickly rally round to comfort her.

Mrs Nock told MailOnline today: 'The wedding was in May 2009. We only had a small wedding,
about 30 people there, and we were coming out of our reception venue.

'We'd just
turned up to have drinks and canapés and we weren’t allowed to have confetti in
the church, so we were having it there. We were just coming out prior to the photos.

Distraught: The grandmother is clearly upset after realising what has happened at the wedding in Cornwall

'My lovely
grandma got the drink and the confetti mixed up. One of my bridesmaids said: “Oh
grandma it's okay. My reaction was the shock of having something thrown in my
face - I wear contact lenses.

'It helped the wedding because not everyone knew each other, and it got everyone talking'

Jennifer Nock

'I couldn’t have cared about
the dress. It didn't ruin the day at all. Grandma stayed out for the
full day - and it helped the wedding because not everyone knew each other, and it
got everyone talking.

YouTube user Mr Nock posted the video with the message: 'Unfortunately this 
actually happened on our wedding day. Watch grandma, she got confused 
with the confetti cup in one hand and the glass of Pimm's in her other hand.

'Luckily
my wife was very cool about it and we laughed it off pretty much 
straight away. Grandma still cringes when we reminisce about this 
story.

Forgiven: A second video posted by Mr Nock shows his wife kissing her grandmother to prove all is well

Happy ending: Mr Nock thanked his wife's grandmother for making their wedding 'even more memorable'

All good fun: Mrs Nock's grandmother, pictured with the couple, was presented with a 'Tippie' cup at her next grandchild's wedding

'For anyone who was concerned over 
the welfare of my Grandma watching "Pimmsgate", there is a little follow 
up Video to show she was OK.'

'Luckily my wife was very cool about it and we laughed it off pretty much straight away'

Darren Nock

Mr
Nock also posted a follow up video showing Jennifer kissing his 
grandmother after the Pimm's incident to reassure viewers that no harm 
was done.

He even added a message which read: 'A very big thanks to Grandma who made our day even more memorable! We love you!'

The first video has already been viewed by more than 700,000 people on YouTube since it was first posted last June.
