They are a hit with celebrities and enjoyed strong Christmas sales - but now animals are getting in on the onesie craze.

A skunk, called Toot, has had its scent glands removed and was dressed in a onesie after the surgery.

The blue and brown babygro was put on the animal by owner Kalis Coravan at her home in Florida, US.Â

Cute: Keeping skunks as pets is illegal in some countries but is permitted in America

Normally when people see a skunk their immediate reaction would be to shoo it away, but this little creature has become a family pet.

Ms Corovan says most people wouldn't immediately think of the notoriously smelly animals as pets, but in fact they make great companions as their scent glands can be removed - eliminating the biggest downside associated with the animals.

Doctors usually fit a cone after surgery but as the skunk was so small they couldn't fit one so restorted to using the onesie.

Now fully healed, her owner reports she is 'running around my house like a crazy fluffy tornado trying to make up for weeks of inactivity.'

Recovering: The scent glands can be removed when the skunk is about four weeks old

Although keeping skunks as pets is rare, they are allowed to be domesticated in the US, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy.

When threatened, skunks can spray a foul-smelling solution that deters predators.

If the animal is to become a pet, scent glands can be removed at about four weeks old. Since 2007, this has been illegal in the UK.
