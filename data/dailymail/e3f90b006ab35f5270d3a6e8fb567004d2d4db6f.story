They were not playing for gold, but defeat still hurt for Andy and Jamie Murray as they lost on the grass of Wimbledon in the first round of the Olympic men's doubles

In a very tight battle with Austria's Jurgen Melzer and Alexander Peya they went down 5-7, 7-6 (8/6), 7-5 after two hours and 23 minutes.

The British pair were cheered on by a raucous crowd on Court Two and edged the first set but, despite being twice a break ahead in the decider, they could not close it out.

It was just one of a number of disapointments suffered by Team GB on a day when none of their medal hopefuls were able to secure a place on the podium.

This afternoon Mark Cavendish failed to challenge in the men's cycling road race and - along with teammates Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome, David Millar and Ian Stannard - finished way out of contention.

Great things had been expected of world champion Cavendish, but it seemed the expectation got the better of him as he finished a disappointing 29th.

He said: 'It's bitterly disappointing. There's 70 guys in our group at the finish, I don't understand why there's (only) three guys riding. It doesn't make sense.

'No-one wants to help us. The Australians sit there. They always just ride negatively...they're happy to see us lose.

'I'd like to say that's how it goes, but it's disappointing.

'But we did everything. We can't make excuses. We did everything we said we were going to do and more. To see the guys with the calibre they've got ride like that for me is incredible.'

On his team-mates, he continued: 
'Incredible. I couldn't be more proud of them. They're still sat there 
in their kit in the tent. They're absolutely spent.

The
disappointment of Cavendish's defeat was followed this evening when 
Team GB's Hannah Miley could manage only fifth place in the 400 metres 
individual medley.

She had been seen as a genuine medal hope after winning silver at last year's World Championships.

was cheered on by an ecstatic home crowd at poolside but the final was 
won by Chinese swimmer Shiwen Ye, who set a new world record.

Elswhere, Steve Grotowski and John 
Garcia-Thompson's Olympic bid for glory in the Beach Volleyball began with a defeat as the British pair 
went down in straight sets against Canada at a pulsating Horse Guards 
Parade.

A near-capacity crowd at the 
15,000-sweater arena did their best to cheer on the home favourites in 
their Pool F opener but their opponents just had that bit more guile 
around the court and emerged with a solid 21-19 21-13 win.

Meanwhile Great Britain's hopes of a men's archery team medal ended at the first hurdle as they were soundly beaten by Ukraine at Lord's.

Having ranked in eighth place on Friday, they had a first-round assignment against ninth seeds Ukraine.

But despite being a close match on 
paper Larry Godfrey, Simon Terry and Alan Wills went down 223-212 to 
Viktor Ruban, Dmytro Hrachov and Markiyan Ivashko.

But it will not be all doom and gloom in the Olympic village tonight among British athletesÂ  - The British women's football team made it two wins out of two with a 3-0 victory over Cameroon.

And at Wimbledon, Elena Baltacha got Great Britain's tennis players off to a winning start by overpowering Hungary's Agnes Szavay in the first round of the women's singles.

In the Olympic boxing tournament at ExCel, Anthony Ogogo got Great Britain off to a successful start with a convincing 13-6 win over Junior Castillo of the Dominican Republic.

After a cagey start, Ogogo pulled away in the final two rounds for a victory which takes him into a last 16 bout against reigning world champion Evgen Khytrov of Ukraine on Thursday afternoon.

Ogogo, whose build-up has been disrupted by his mother's serious illness, was roared into the ring by the capacity 6,000 crowd and visibly relaxed as the bout went on.
