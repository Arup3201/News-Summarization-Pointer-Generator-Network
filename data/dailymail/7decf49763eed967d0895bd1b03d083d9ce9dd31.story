There is no need to request a room with a view if you’re planning to book a night at London’s latest luxury hotel, which opens today.

The Shangri-La Hotel, At The Shard is located in one of the tallest buildings in Western Europe and each of its 202 guestrooms features floor-to-ceiling windows that offer a breathtaking perspective on the capital.

Living the high life: The hotel will be home to London's highest champagne bar, which will be located on the 52nd floor

'Cocoon of quiet luxury': Guests will be whisked up to the 'sky lobby' on the 35th floor via a high-speed elevator

The five-star hotel will occupy floors 34 to 52 of Renzo Piano’s iconic 1016ft tall building on the banks of the River Thames.

Rooms will cost from £450 a night and each of them will feature a unique layout and design thanks to The Shard’s spiral shape.

Floor-to-ceiling windows will offer guests vertigo-inducing views that take in Tower Bridge, Canary Wharf, the O2 Arena and beyond.

Inside, there will be body-contouring Shangri-La beds, marble bathrooms with heated floors, Acqua Di Parma toiletries and televisions integrated with mirrors.

Expanding portfolio: The new venue is the Hong Kong-based luxury hotel group's first property in the UK

Top table: The hotel's signature restaurant, Ting, will be located 420ft up on the 35th floor and will offer a 360-degree view of London

But it is the hotel’s three ‘signature suites’ - which will be unveiled in September - that will feature some of the most jaw-dropping views.

All three overlook St Paul’s Cathedral and Tower Bridge, and the Shangri-La suite on the 39th floor will offer a 180-degree view of the Thames that takes in the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, the Tower of London, Tate Modern, Shakespeare’s Globe theatre, and Canary Wharf.

Not surprisingly, the stunning vistas come with an equally stunning price tag: a suite is expected to cost up to £3,250, but the fee includes a personal butler who will ensure you don’t have to avert your gaze to top up your champagne.

Height of luxury: Ting, whose name is derived Chinese word for 'living room', will serve a European menu with a 'hint of Asian flavouring'

Room with a view: The rooms all feature floor-to-ceiling windows, which make the most of the hotel's location

A clean sweep: The hotel's guests can even enjoy the view while in the bath - though luckily no-one can see in to the rooms

The site is the Hong Kong-based luxury hotel group’s first property in the UK and its third in Europe: the group opened a hotel in Paris in 2010 and one in Istanbul in 2013.

The owners describe the new property – which cost £40 million and was due to open last year - as a ‘cocoon of quiet luxury’.

It will have a dedicated entrance on St Thomas Street, where a high-speed elevator will whisk guests up to the ‘sky lobby’ on the 35th floor for a complimentary cup of jasmine tea.

Breathtaking panorama: The best suites will offers views that take in Tower Bridge, Canary Wharf, the O2 Arena and beyond

Tall order: Láng, a patisserie and artisan deli, will serve cakes and savoury snacks on the hotel's ground floor

Private entrance: A high-speed elevator on St Thomas Street will whisk guests up to the hotel's 'sky lobby' on the 35th floor

The hotel’s show-stopping facilities include London’s highest infinity pool and highest champagne bar, which will both be located on the 52nd floor and will open in July.

The Shangri-La’s signature restaurant, Ting, will be located 420ft up on the 35th floor and will offer a 360-degree view of London.

The restaurant, whose name is derived from the Chinese word for ‘living room’, will serve a European menu with a ‘hint of Asian flavouring’

It will be open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and British ingredients – including Scottish scallops, Welsh lamb and Kentish apples - will feature heavily on the menu.

Guests will also be able to book in for afternoon tea, opting for either a classic English version or an Asian-inspired alternative, and can take their pick from over 30 different teas.

Iconic backdrop: The event space on the 34th floor offers unrivalled views of The City of London

Meanwhile Láng, a patisserie and artisan deli, will serve cakes and savoury snacks, along with ‘seasonal’ hampers, on the hotel’s ground floor.

There will also be three event spaces on the 34th floor facing the Thames that will offer state-of-the-art conferencing technology.

And the hotel’s grand staircase, which sweeps across double length floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking St Paul’s Cathedral, is being billed as the perfect spot for a wedding shoot.

Darren Gearing, executive vice president and hotel general manager said: ‘We are thrilled to be opening our doors in May after a number of years of planning and preparation.

'The hotel’s inspiring views will connect emotionally with guests, while our service hallmarks will position the hotel at the forefront of the world’s finest hotels.’
