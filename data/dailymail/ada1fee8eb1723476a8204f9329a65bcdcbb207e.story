Game of Thrones exploded in popularity when it was first brought to our screens, and now a dedicated couple of fans have created their very own homage - by dressing their dogs up as the show's main characters.

'The Pugs of Westeros' sees canine trio Roxy, Blue and Bono playing doggy versions of the show's main characters, including Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and conniving King Joffrey.

The pugs' owners, Phillip Lauer, 57, and his wife Sue, 47, from California, have been dressing their pugs up as characters from cinema and TV since they were puppies.

And while the pair normally only shoot stills, they jumped at the chance of creating a mini-movie based on one of their favourite shows after being contacted by streaming service Blinkbox.

Mr Lauer said: 'Sue is a professional photographer and designer and she loves to take pictures of our pugs in various scenarios. When blinkbox set us the challenge of a Game of Thrones tribute, we couldn't resist. Sue spent two weeks just creating the Iron Throne alone but it was well worth it.

'The pugs have been doing this since they were puppies. We have a studio set up in the garage and whenever I walk them towards it they get excited, no doubt wondering what's next. It's fun for them, but they do take it seriously - they are proper little professionals.'
