Mayweather told Fight Hype: 'Training camp has gone tremendously thus far, all I can do is just wait. This is not just a big fight, this is the biggest fight in boxing history.

When you look back at Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Tommy Hearns, Roberto Duran, Larry Holmes, Mike Tyson, Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Robinson, Wilfred Benitez, the Spinks brothers, Pernell Whitaker, James Toney, Cornelius Edwards and the list goes on and on. I just come in and take my hat off to the guys who paved the way for me to be where I am at today.'
