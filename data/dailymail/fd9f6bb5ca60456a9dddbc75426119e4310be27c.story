A Florida sheriff's office inadvertently announced its trust in dogs.

A rug in the lobby of the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office building was a sight to see. Not because of its forest green color or its yellow sheriff's emblem. But because it read 'In Dog We Trust.'

The rug, placed at the building's entrance, should have read 'In God We Trust.' But a small typo quickly changed an age-old adage to a tribute to dogs.

The $500 rug was removed from the lobby Wednesday after being there for months once a deputy noticed the mistake, ABC reports.

There were two of the rugs in the office, but only one contained the typo. All of the other words on the rug were spelled correctly, according to the New York Daily News.

Entrance: The rug was at the office's (photographed) entrance when the deputy noticed the error, the rug was quickly rolled up and put away

The rug was at the office's entrance when the deputy noticed the error, the rug was quickly rolled up and put away, according to ABC.

A spokesperson for the sheriff's office said the manufacturer, American Floor Mats, is to blame for the error because the proofs the office signed and submitted to the manufacturer contained the correct spelling, the Tampa Bay Times reports. 

The sheriff's office is working to have the rug replaced, a spokesperson said.
