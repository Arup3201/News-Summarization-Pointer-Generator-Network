Battle: For years Caroline Dowdall struggled with a phobia of vomit, so much so she would starve and drug her own children

A woman’s extreme fear of vomit led to her starving her young children in case food would make them sick.

Caroline Dowdall would even give her three sons car sickness drugs before long journeys to ensure that they would not throw up.

The 54-year-old’s emetophobia controlled her life during her sons’ childhoods as she was too scared to feed them more than a basic diet of rice, toast and the occasional boiled egg.

Caroline’s battle with emetophobia - the irrational fear of vomit - began when she was eight and her pregnant aunt was sick on her during a car journey.

‘It
was a hot sticky day and I was horrified,’ Caroline explains.

‘It was 
of course an accident but the smell repulsed me and after that I began 
to actively avoid people who I thought might vomit.’

At
school she avoided pupils who had been off sick as well as the canteen,
which she considered a high risk area, and feared pregnant women.

She 
would cross the street if saw a woman she suspected was pregnant and as 
she got older and her friends became pregnant she would simply cut them 
out of her life.

‘I lost friends because it would be too stressful otherwise,’ she says.

When Caroline herself fell pregnant at the age of 20, she lied to midwives to obtain medication to prevent her from 
being sick.

‘I said I had terrible morning sickness, thankfully I hadn’t
but I wanted to take something to prevent me getting it.’

Despite warnings of side effects she took the medication throughout her pregnancy and gave birth to first son Anthony.

She was a happy mother to a healthy baby boy, but it did not take long before the phobia took control of her parenting.

‘At first it was OK, the baby sick didn’t really smell of anything and there wasn’t much. The real anxiety came when it was time to wean him because I knew that once he was on solid food he would produce what I called “proper vomit.”’

Controlled: Caroline, pictured with her oldest sons Anthony and Philip,  was so terrified of vomit that she would not give her sons any food she thought might make them sick and they grew up on a diet of toast, rice and eggs

After pressure from her partner a reluctant Caroline agreed he should be on solids.

‘I only gave him food I was happy wouldn’t make him sick and tiny amounts too.’

It was the same routine when his brothers Philip and Tim were born.

By then her first marriage had ended and Caroline had remarried, again managing to keep her phobia a secret. Dinner for her sons was often toast and occasionally a boiled egg.

‘It would break my heart when they asked for dessert as I considered sweet foods to pose the highest risk and so I always lied and said we didn’t have any.

‘If they wanted snacks I gave them crackers and other meals were limited to plain rice and chicken, easy to digest and always well cooked.’

Enough to survive: Caroline justified her children's low calorie intake of a few hundred a day with the argument that they had more than children in other parts of the world

Shockingly, Caroline also kept their portions tiny, fearing that overfeeding them could induce sickness.

‘They
were probably on just a few hundred calories a day. At most meal times 
they would ask for more like Oliver Twist. It was awful.

‘It
broke my heart when they said their tummies hurt. I knew it was because
they were hungry but I was so scared of not being able to cope if they 
were sick I never relented.

‘I knew they had enough to survive on and reasoned that they still ate more than a lot of children in the world.’

Thankfully her sons grew into healthy boys and in the mid-eighties Caroline attempted to seek help.

But when she saw her GP she was ushered out of the door and in her desperation Caroline turned to alcohol to cope.

‘I was left to cope in the only way I knew how. On the rare occasion that any of her kids were sick she downed Brandy to give her the courage to clean it up.

‘I still couldn’t cuddle them or hold them in the way a mum should if they were sick. And I would swig alcohol believing it might stop me from catching whatever bug they had by killing the germs.’

Finally free: Caroline, pictured on holiday in Florida with her husband John, eventually began to deal with her phobia when she came clean to her family about her behaviour

Holidays were also a nightmare, as she could not bear to watch them on funfair rides and feared travel sickness.

‘Thankfully my parents were always keen to take them on holiday so I managed to avoid it most of the time.’

But when she did have to take the boys somewhere by car Caroline resorted to shocking methods to prevent sickness.

‘I would drug them with travel sickness pills that caused drowsiness. If they were asleep then they couldn’t vomit,’ she says.

When they grew older she would pay them to take the drugs, despite them not even feeling sick.

‘Then they would close their eyes for the rest of the journey and I could relax and get us there without worrying.’

Coping: Caroline now lives in Spain and can enjoy meals in restaurants and time with her grandchildren without fear

Caroline
calls her actions during these years ‘truly awful and unspeakable
behaviour for a mother’ but says the phobia was in control of her life.

‘It’s very hard to distinguish right from wrong, you are just trying to get through the day in any way you can.

‘I loved them dearly and I didn’t want them taken off me.’

She says: ‘My phobia stopped me being a good mother. But I’m adamant that I will not let it stop me being a good grandmother.

'My sons are now old enough to understand why I acted the way I did when they were little.’

Eventually Caroline divorced again and met third husband John. By then two of her sons had become fathers and Caroline was already starting to avoid the babies through fear they would be sick.

‘I knew I had been a terrible mother and I didn’t want to repeat my mistakes but I could feel history was repeating.

'I was desperate to be a good grandmother and have my grandchildren come to stay but once again my fear was controlling my life.’

Eventually she broke down and admitted to her husband why she was so afraid of spending time with her grandchildren.

‘It was the first time anyone had listened and understood. He promised to help me and I don’t know it is simply a case of sharing the load, but since I started being honest with my family I feel more in control.

‘My family was relieved, my odd behaviour over the past 46 years finally made sense and I have said sorry to my sons.

‘I was determined fear would not stop me being a grandmother.'

Now Caroline can spend time with her grandchildren and even enjoy a meal in a restaurant and has written a book about her journey.

‘There are other sufferers out there, and I want them to know they are not alone.

‘Now it’s still a struggle but it’s much easier. There’s a long way to go but I will get there.'
