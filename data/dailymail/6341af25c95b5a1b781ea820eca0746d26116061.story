A headmistress has sent parents to the naughty step and banned them from swearing in front of their children.

A newsletter sent to parents said children could not be blamed for using expletives because they were merely repeating words overheard at home.

Davina Wakelin, head at Meeching Valley Primary School in Newhaven, East Sussex, told mothers and fathers to wash their mouths out with soap.

She wrote: ‘I have received complaints regarding parents swearing when bringing children to and from school.

'Swearing is not permitted on school grounds and I ask all parents to think about the language you use when on school grounds. Thank you for your consideration with this matter.’

Mrs Wakelin said pupils had been caught repeating swear words that their parents had been heard using en route to school and in the playground.

‘You do hear the parents talking to each other and there are some parents who swear,’ she said.

‘It can be carried through to children.  They do not realise that it is the wrong language and children can pick up on it.

'Some children have heard parents swearing and there have been incidents of children subsequently swearing.

‘It is unacceptable but we can’t blame  children – they are just repeating what they have heard. But we have explained to them why it is not acceptable and why it will not  be allowed.’

Governors echoed Mrs Wakelin’s concerns and supported her efforts to eradicate  bad language.

One governor, who did not want to be named, said: ‘There will always be parents who use bad language because they use it at home and that’s just what happens, and you get children who use words like that because that’s what their parents are doing.

‘But when you’re in front of other people’s children you should watch what you  are saying.

‘Parents do get upset when their children have heard words they don’t want them  to hear.

‘It’s about consideration for others. It’s thinking of the other children in the school, and some parents don’t like to hear these words either.’

One of the school’s rules was to show respect to other people and not swearing was part of this, the governor added.
