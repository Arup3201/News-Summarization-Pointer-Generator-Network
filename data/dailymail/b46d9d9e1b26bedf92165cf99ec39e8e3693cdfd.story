If you've ever wanted to own an 'Iron Man' exoskeleton, then now could be your chance – as long as you have $1 million (£659,000) to burn.

A Japanese electronics firm is selling a 13ft (four metre) mechanical suit on Amazon which can be controlled by an iPhone or by stepping inside the device.

Dubbed Kuratas, the five-ton, four-wheeled device was the brainchild of inventor Kogora Kurata from Japan's Kanto region.

'It seemed unlikely that anyone would develop giant robots however long I waited. And so I thought, I might as well make one myself - that's how it started,' Kurata said in an interview with Zoomin.TV.

Kuratas can be operated using a 'Master-Slave system' where users control the robot's movements from outside using any device with a 3G network.

They can also step inside the suit to control its movements in the same way as exoskeletons are used for fictional characters such as Iron Man.

Overall, the robot has around 30 hydraulic joints which the pilot moves using motion control. It comes in 16 colours, including black and pink.

It can also be fitted with a futuristic weapons system, including a gun capable of shooting 6,000 BB bullets a minute, which fires when the pilot smiles

Currently Kuratas is not capable of walking, but is able to drive at 6mph (10 km/h) 

It can also be fitted with a futuristic weapons system, including a gun capable of shooting 6,000 BB bullets a minute, which fires when the pilot smiles.

'Automatic alignment allows you to lock on your enemy target. Kuratas will not allow any targets to escape,' the company writes.

'With the alignment set appropriately the system will fire BBs when the pilot smiles.'

Realising that there may be a flaw with this system of opening fire, a video warns the pilot against smiling too much while operating the Kuratas weaponry. 

However, there is another major caveat. The robot is advertised as a kit, which means whoever buys it will also have to put it together.

The exoskeleton would allow firefighters to easily rescue and carry people out of fires

A radical new suit for the firefighter of the future has been revealed that could give them superhuman strength.

The exoskeleton would allow firefighters to easily rescue and carry people out of fires, or take heavy equipment up flights of stairs inside a burning building.

It can be fitted with a range of gadgets for different missions, including a high pressure water hose that clips onto the arm.

'Each year, an estimated 15,500 high-rise structure fires cause 60 civilian deaths, 930 injuries, and $252 million in property loss,' said Melbourne designer Ken Chen.

'High-rise buildings can hold thousands of people well above the reach of fire department aerial devices, once the fire is above the operational reach of aerial ladder or elevating platforms the chance of rescuing victims is near zero.'

To help solve the problem, Chen designed a strap on exoskeleton to boost firefighter's strength and allow them to easily climb high buildings.

'The A.F.A exoskeleton suit aim to increases firefighters’ performance in walking, running and carrying while high-rise fire fighting,' he explained.
