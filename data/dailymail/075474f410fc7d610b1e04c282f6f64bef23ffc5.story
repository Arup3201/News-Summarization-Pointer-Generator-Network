The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had a rare night out on their Royal tour Saturday when they attended a rugby union match in Sydney.

It was the first time the royal couple had been out in the evening away from official duties during their whirlwind tour of Australia and New Zealand.

William, 31, sipped on a beer as he sat next to Kate to watch the match between the New South Wales Waratahs and South Africa's Northern Bulls.

Time to relax: After a busy day of official duties in Queensland, the Duke and Duchess kicked back to enjoy the game

The Duchess, 31, dressed in a casual grey sweater, Beulah London cashmere scarf and jeans, and laughed and chatted to a woman sitting next to her in the corporate box at Allianz Stadium.

William wore his glasses in order to watch the match closely, and dressed in a bright blue sweater, checked shirt and jeans. Sir David Manning, one of his closest aides, also attended the stadium The Waratahs won, beating the Bulls 19-12.

The last time the couple were seen out in the evening on the royal tour was in New Zealand to attend a lavish State Reception thrown by New Zealand Governor General Sir Jerry Mateparae at his official residence, Government House.

Kate paid tribute to her Kiwi royal tour hosts as she dazzled in an evening dress embroidered with silver ferns.

Earlier in the day the royal couple visited RAAF base Amberley, near Brisbane, where they climbed inside the cockpit of a Super Hornet fighter jet.

The Duke and Duchess were presented with a framed photograph of a jet in flight before posing for a photograph with 1 Squadron.

William climbed into the front pilot's position in the aircraft before switching to the back seat, which is used to control the jet's weapons systems.

The Duchess then saw her chance and stepped elegantly into the front seat despite wearing four-inch heels and a tight-fitting knee length white LK Bennett dress with blue flowers.

The pair sat for a while asking questions before moving on to a simulator where they took an imaginary flight over Queensland and the Gold Coast in a simulated super hornet flight.

Rare treat: It was a rare non-official outing for the couple, who have been on a whirlwind tour of Australia and New Zealand

Casual attire: The Duchess wore a casual grey sweater, printed silk scarf and jeans while the Duke opted for a bright blue sweater, checked shirt and jeans

Chief of Air Force Air Marshall Geoff Brown and Commanding Officer of Number 1 Squadron, Stephen Chappell talked the young royals through the jet's operation.

Air Marshall Brown revealed the pair were preferring Australia's weather to the conditions turned on by New Zealand - where it was cold and rained for most of the 10-day visit.

'They talked about the weather and that it was a lot better than when they were in New Zealand,' Air Marshall Brown said.

Commanding Officer Chappell said Kate was fascinated by the 'dials and gadgets' on the Super Hornet.

He remarked there was some 'biplay between the two as to who was sitting in what seat'.

Busy schedule: The last time the couple were seen out together at night was for an official State Reception in New Zealand

Where's George? The little prince was nowhere to be seen, having stayed in Sydney for the day while the couple flew to Brisbane

The royals signed the official visitors book and posed for a photo with members of the number one squadron, before being taken to a Super Hornet flight simulator. 

Prince George was absent, staying behind in Sydney with his nanny.

Their Royal Highnesses were greeted by Australian Defence Force chief David Hurley and wife Linda on the tarmac.

Kate turned to the high street for the day in a £245 ($440 AUD) Lasa Poppy Print dress by luxury British designer L.K. Bennett, with her hair half swept from her face.

She has hardly put a foot wrong in the fashion department during the whole tour - and today was no exception for the Duchess of Cambridge

The stylish Queen-to-be was also spotted carrying a gorgeous clutch by Australian brand Oroton in the same royal blue of the flowers on the dress.

The couple flew in from their base in Sydney in an Air Force jet for the day leaving their son, Prince George, at Admiralty House with his nanny.

Her husband wore a black suit with a maroon and navy striped tie.

The RAAF band played verses from Advance Australia Fair and God Save the Queen as the duke inspected the waiting Royal Guard.

William is no stranger to the military having served more than seven years in the British army and air force.

Last September he finished a three-year tour of duty as a search and rescue helicopter pilot and has made sure to connect with service men and women during the Australian and New Zealand tour.

The prince chatted to Guard members during his inspection, pausing while four F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jets flew over in formation to mark the event.

General Hurley and his wife shared banter with the duchess on the edge of the tarmac while the duke finished his inspection.

The royal couple then met Queensland's Governor Penelope Wensley, Premier Campbell Newman and his wife Lisa, Defence Minister David Johnston, Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale and other VIPs, who were standing on a red carpet on the edge of the tarmac.

They couple were then whisked out of the hot Queensland sun to inspect one of the Super Hornet jets and meet members of the RAAF's No 1 Squadron.

The visit was, said a royal aide, a chance to for the couple - particularly William - to foster and ongoing relationship with the armed forces in Australia.
