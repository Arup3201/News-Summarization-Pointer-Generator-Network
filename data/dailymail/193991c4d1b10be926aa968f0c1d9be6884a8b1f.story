As most of the country sees the hottest days yet this summer, people - and animals - of all stripes do whatever they can to keep things cool.

Thankfully, there are cooler temperatures in sight for the Midwest, so creatures like the Brookfield, Illinois zoo's African lion will no longer have to take their meals in the form of frozen meat pops.

The Northeast, also in the grip of a heat wave that just won't quit, will chill out by the weekend as cooler air moves in from Canada and gives man and beast a much needed break.

But with relief may come some new threatening weather as severe thunderstorms could accompany the falling temperatures.

As things finally cool off late Saturday, isolated but powerful thunderstorms could drench the already reeling Northeast.

Until then, the New York region has another day in the 90s to look forward to.

Look for sweet relief on Sunday, when the mercury isn’t predicted to rise above 90 for the first time in a week.

The largest heat wave of the summer has stagnated over large regions, bringing sizzling temperatures and little hope of relief without rain, a growing possibility for some hard-hit areas as the weekend approaches.

Most states in the U.S. had at least one region where the temperature hit 90 degrees Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service, though the worst heat was in the Midwest to Northeast.

Humid air just made it all feel worse, with heat indexes in some places over 100.

It was hot enough to buckle highway pavement in several states. Firefighters in Indianapolis evacuated 300 people from a senior living community after a power outage knocked out the air conditioning.
