Yvonne Pickford, 55, was hit by her daughter's sledge and found lumps in her breasts which turned out to be malignant when she was checking herself for bruises

A mother-of-three discovered she had life-threatening breast cancer after being knocked over by her daughter's sledge on a ski trip.

Yvonne Pickford, 55, from Olton in Solihull, had been on an annual family holiday in Valmorel, France when the sledging accident happened- and she then discovered a cancerous lump as she checked herself over for bruises.

Her six-year-old daughter Jenii Quigley sped down a hill in the sledge but crashed into her mother, who was waiting at the bottom of the slope.

Mrs Pickford, a theatre nurse who works at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, said her daughter knocking her down ironically saved her life.

She said: 'Thank God Jenii hit me with the sledge - she saved my life. 

'If she hadn't have done that I wouldn't have checked myself over that night and discovered the lump.

'I do normally check for lumps, but hadn't done for a while and decided that while I was making sure I was OK I would feel around for anything on my breasts.'

She contacted her GP and mentioned  the growth as soon as she was home. 

Tests revealed  two lumps on her right breast and one on the left side.

Mrs Pickford, said she counts herself very lucky to have caught the cancer before it spread further.

She said: 'One of the lumps on the right breast was malignant and the cancer was spreading fast. 

'They told me it was a good job I had found it when I did.'

Mrs Pickford, who is also a grandmother, underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in a bid to beat the disease after the diagnosis in 2003.

Since then she has raised more than £15,000 for Cancer Research UK.

She will now front the charity's newest campaign - Stand Up For Cancer - which has been organised with Channel 4.

She said: 'I believe wholeheartedly in research and have run marathons and even cycled across India to raise funds.'

'I'm so grateful for the treatment that saved my life but not everyone survives. That's why I want to do all I can to get people standing up to cancer right now.' 

Mrs Pickford said that six -year-old daughter Jenii 'saved her life' when she careered into her with a sledge on a family skiing holiday in Valmorel, France, as it led to her being diagnosed with breast cancer

'We need to fight back against this disease by raising money so that brilliant research can be translated into treatments for patients faster.'

A host of celebrities have joined the Stand Up to Cancer campaign, which will culminate in a live TV fundraiser on October 17.

As part of the drive, Birmingham has been chosen as one of only 15 cities to host a unique March on Cancer event, which will take place simultaneously around the UK on October 11.
