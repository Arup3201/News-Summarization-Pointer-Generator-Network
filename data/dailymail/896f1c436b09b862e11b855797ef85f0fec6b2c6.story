We all know that when we're happy and in love, there is a tendency to pile on the pounds. 

This is exactly what happened to Becky Owen, 31, from Alton in Hampshire. She met boyfriend Matt on a dating website and once they'd settled into  coupledom, she couldn't stop eating fatty foods and piling into bigger portions, matching her boyfriend plate for plate.

Soon, Becky reached her heaviest ever weight at 15 and a half stone.

Fed up of feeling unhealthy and out of breath all the time, the marketing events planner decided to take drastic action. 

In just nine months, Becky lost over four stone, went down to a size 12 - and got engaged. 

Becky first noticed that she was becoming more out of breath when she started to struggle going for weekend walks with partner Matt, 34.

Becky says: 'Matt is a very active person and we always end up doing something together at weekends, such as swimming or walking up Box Hill in Guildford. 

'But as the weight crept up, I noticed I was getting out of breath walking and never kept up with Matt. It was beginning to make me feel miserable.'

Soon Becky started to make excuses not to go, so she didn't have to feel like she was struggling.  

She explains: 'I was missing out on spending quality time with Matt because of my weight and feeling unhealthy, so I decided to do something about it.'  

The couple first met through dating site Match.com and at the time Becky was a size 14 and never felt concerned about her weight before.

She added: 'I was still an active person and I felt comfortable in my own skin. 

'When I first met up with Matt, my weight was never an issue to me.' 

But after romance blossomed between the pair, within a couple of months of being together, Becky started to pile on the pounds.

She explains: 'I was so happy that I hadn't noticed my clothes felt tight and my arms were wobbling more.'

At her heaviest, 5ft 4 Becky weighed 15 and a half stone and was a size 20. She was also beginning to feel the side effects from unhealthy food choices and eating extra portions.

Becky explains: 'Matt has such a fast metabolism, that he can eat whatever he wants.

'When he used to order an extra large pizza, I would do the same, but while he never piled on the weight, it was a completely different story for me.

'Matt didn't care what I weighed, but in my heart I knew I had to make different lifestyle choices - and fast.'

In the end, Becky ended up joining a local Weight Watchers group and kept to a diet and exercise plan. 

Incredibly within nine months, she had lost over 4st and was down to a slim size 12.

'If we were going out for a meal I used to order a big pizza, fudge cake for pudding, all washed down with a couple of glasses of wine.

'But now when I go out I order a skinny pizza and a gin and tonic - it's all about making those different choices and sticking to them.'

Not only did Becky feel incredible, but Matt was so proud of her achievement that he proposed that year while they were away on holiday.  

Becky says: 'I couldn't believe it, I had lost all this weight and now I was engaged too - it felt like all my dreams were coming true. 

In July this year, Becky and Matt tied the knot in a lavish ceremony near their home in Hampshire. 

'I felt like a princess walking down that aisle in my size 12 dress - I've never felt more confident.'
