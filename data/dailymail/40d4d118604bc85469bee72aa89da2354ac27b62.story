The clocks went back last weekend – and how times have changed in the North East.

British Summer Time was a dark place for Newcastle manager Alan Pardew. Only now, as the nights cut in, has the gloom lifted. In fact, it’s as if the sun is beating down upon the once beleaguered boss.

But for opposite number Gus Poyet at Sunderland, with autumn has come the fall.

Earlier this month, the pre-match conferences of the two managers clashed. Just one national journalist ventured to the Academy of Light to deliver a few easy, overarm questions to Poyet.

Not that the Uruguayan was complaining. Sunderland weren’t the story, they were ticking along quietly, picking up enough singles to keep them off the back pages.

Meanwhile, 16 miles up the road on North Tyneside, Pardew – on a decidedly stickier wicket - was batting away bouncers, pace, swing and spin. He was the story, odds-on favourite to be the next top-flight manager headed for the pavilion.

But then, against Leicester and again at Spurs, his team smashed successive boundaries. Then, at Manchester City in the League Cup, they knocked everyone for six with a shock 2-0 victory.

Meanwhile, at the Stadium of Light, Poyet has been on the back foot, the 8-0 humiliation at Southampton followed by an error-ridden 2-0 defeat at home to Arsenal. The temptation to ring fence the South Coast collapse as a one-off is proving, well, less tempting.

At their worst this season, Sunderland and Newcastle have borne the same harrowing hallmarks; jagged in defence – to the point of self-harm – and blunt in attack.

But it is on Wearside where those sorry symptoms look set to linger. Poyet continues to talk in riddles – is he happy with the strength and depth of his squad or isn’t he? You’d have to side with the latter.

The players – as shown during the closing stages of last season – are not incapable. You have to worry, however, that it took the threat of relegation – and a drop in wages and status – to snap them from their slumber.

Nine new signings have yet to shine, either. Only Patrick van Aanholt is holding down a regular starting place, but he has no competition at left back.

VIDEO Pardew proud of youngsters 

Yes, Jack Rodwell is putting himself about and snapping through challenges – often running the risk of red – but the £10million midfielder wasn’t bought as an enforcer - there has been precious little evidence of the silk which made him so easy on the eye as a teenager.

Likewise, though, at Newcastle, where it has been those already in residence at St James’ who have earned Pardew his reprieve – Papiss Cisse, Gabriel Obertan, Sammy Ameobi, Steven Taylor, Fabricio Coloccini, Moussa Sissoko and Tim Krul the men making the difference of late.

It would, of course, be folly to determine that the recent reversal in fortune will not swing again in the coming weeks.

But Poyet is the story right now and the Stadium of Light feels like a cool and shaded place.

On Monday night, at Crystal Palace, he faces trial by television, just like Pardew did at Stoke last month, and that 1-0 defeat made for uncomfortable viewing.

It certainly promises to be a testing time for Poyet – how he wishes he could wind back the clock.
