All she wanted was a city break and a fish supper.

But yesterday the dolphin that took a detour to Chester by swimming up the River Dee got a timely lift home – after a spot of unplanned sunbathing.

The 6ft short-beaked common dolphin was rescued after her sojourn ended with her stranded on a sandbank in the morning sun.

A disorientated dolphin has been given a lift back to sea in a lifeboat after being spotted 30 miles inland

Davina the Dolphin was seen frolicking in the River Dee at Chester where it became a tourist attraction

RNLI lifeboat was called and the crew gently hoisted the friendly mammal into their inflatable and took it out to sea

Rescuers heaved her into a special stretcher aboard an inshore lifeboat and carried her six miles out to sea.

There
 – with a flick of her tail and to cheers from the crew – she headed off
 safely into the distance, presumably in search of the pod she abandoned
 for an unscheduled excursion on Monday.

The
 rescue ended days of excitement along a nine-mile stretch of the Dee as
 Dave (as she was inappropriately christened) treated crowds to a 
display of leaping and trademark ‘clicking’ sounds rarely encountered so
 close to a city centre.

Rare sight: This dolphin was spotted swimming up the river Dee in North Wales on Monday

Hungry: The young dolphin has swum 30 miles chasing fish up the river to within half a mile of the city centre

She
 is believed to have left the Irish Sea in pursuit of salmon and trout 
but was halted by a weir beside Chester race course, within sight of the
 ancient city walls.

Powerful spring tides are thought to have prevented her return to open water.

Yesterday Davina, as she was hastily renamed, was spotted floundering on a sandbank and clearly in danger.

RNLI
 volunteers worked alongside the British Divers Marine Life Rescue 
charity to lift her on to the boat for a delicate, two-hour return 
voyage to the sea.
