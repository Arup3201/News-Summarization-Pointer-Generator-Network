The unarmed Local Neighbourhood Policing Team officers, who had a warrant, entered the house at about 1pm.

It is believed they were confronted by the man at the top of the stairs, who had his hands behind his back.

When he was asked to show his hands, he refused and officers tried to restrain him.

It is thought he was holding the weapon and it went as he was being restrained.

No details have been released about the gun.

'The occupant, a 49-year old-man, received fatal injuries and died at the scene.'

The Independents Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has been informed and are visiting the scene.

'A thorough assessment about the level of IPCC involvement required is now under way.'
