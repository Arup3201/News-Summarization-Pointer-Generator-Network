Too young: 50-year-old celebrity mixologist Darryl Robinson (here with Dr. Oz) was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment Wednesday from unknown causes

'At learning of this morning's sad news, our thoughts go out to Darryl Robinson's family & friends,' tweeted a Cooking Channel spokesperson Wednesday morning.

Robinson appeared on his own show called Drink Up in which he taught viewers how to create simple but creative cocktails.

After the show was not renewed after the 2010 season, Robinson made the television rounds with appearances alongside Wendy Williams, on VH1's Morning Buzz and on Access Hollywood.

He really worked at making himself a brand and made a career out of it,' his friend Maggie Mistal told the New York Daily News. 'Everybody is just as shocked as I am. Weâ€™re all confused.'

TV personality: Robinson had his own Cooking Channel show in 2010 called Drink Up. Though it was not renewed by the network after one season, the native Long Islander became known on the talk show circuit for his creative cocktails

Robinson was not classically trained in mixology and said on his website that all he knew he learned 'in the trenches.'

For the native Long Islander, those trenches were--at least in part--in the once super trendy but now defunct Hudson Bar.

Robinson's last post on his website was a Super Bowl mezcal cocktail on February 1.

Autopsy results were still pending Wednesday afternoon.

Unknown causes: Robinson went on to appear on the Wendy Williams Show, VH1 and on Hollywood Insider. His body was found by police after a concerned friend called to report he could not contact the 50-year-old. No drugs were found in his Brooklyn home, according to authorities
