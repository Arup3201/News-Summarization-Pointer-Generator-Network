Her body is her career so it makes sense that no expense is spared when it comes to the health regime of supermodel Miranda Kerr.

Indeed, the slender Victoria's Secret girl is so keen to keep her diet on the straight and narrow that she has invested £500 in a swanky blender she says does a whole lot more than just whizz up fruit and veg, reported health and beauty site Get The Gloss this week..

MIranda's kitchen companion is a state-of-the-art Vitamix Total Nutrition Centre (now there's a name for a kitchen gadget) she uses to whip up her much-loved daily smoothie: a chia seed and goji berry concoction.

Gadget: The Vitamix Total Nutrition Health Centre blender is loved by health conscious A-listers like Miranda Kerr, but it will set you back £500

Celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson (famous for training Gwyneth and Madonna) is a fan, and personal trainer and nutrition expert James Duigan rates the machines highly too, using one to make 60 shakes a day at Bodyism, his London gym. 

After a year and a half of very high usage, Duigan says the blender is still as good as ever.

He uses his to blend up shakes for the likes of Bodyism client Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who has previously extolled the virtues of his Clean & Lean Body Brilliance and Beauty Food smoothies 
mixed with almond milk and coconut oil. And Duigan's wife Christiane whips up soups in a few minutes while juggling work and baby.

'It's actually kind of a miracle,' he says.

High praise indeed. So what sets this blender apart from the norm? The kitchen device markets itself as much more than an ordinary blender thanks to laser-cut blades that reach speeds of 240 mph making light work of fruit and vegetable pulp, skin, pips and seeds.

The high powered blades create a ‘blend’ of smoothie or juice that contains 100 per cent of the goodness and nutrients from fruit and vegetables.

The firm claims that the Vitamix 
blender is powerful enough to break down the cell walls of fresh, whole
 foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients.

Tough fibrous cell 
walls on fruits work like a barrier, they say, preventing us from 
efficiently digesting the nutrients inside our bodies.

Removing these with a powerful chopping tool can help your body digest all the nutrients available in the ingredients.

Fresh fan: Miranda made a video for Net-a-porter showing her fans how to whip up her morning smoothie using the expensive gadget

The device, whose jug is made of the same material as aeroplane windows or police riot shields, grinds wholegrains into flour, makes ice cream in moments by whizzing frozen berries with yoghurt or cream, and can make hot soup
 in five minutes from fresh vegetables thanks to the friction created by the fast-spinning blades.

Nutritionists say making soup in this way is the healthiest method of cooking as you can
 
evenly warm a soup through without burning any of the ingredients or boiling away nutrients.

You can put apple core, stalks, carrot tops, peel of lemon and lime or ginger in the machine.

Wholefoods use it to make smoothies, Starbucks make frappuccinos using the device and McDonalds even make their McFlurrys with it.

Laying her blender love on the line, Miranda Kerr made a video tutorial for Net-a-porter's The Edit to show her fans exactly how to create her morning smoothie at home.

‘Boys like their cars, I like my Vitamix,' she joked in the tutorial.

Shona Wilkinson, Head Nutritionist at The Nutri Centre, said: 'The numbers of stars following juice diets has sped into the stratosphere of late.

'From A-listers wanting to get red carpet ready to reality stars wanting to trim down and get healthy, they're all on board the juicing train.

'So it was only a matter of time before a new juicing machine took celebsville by storm. 

'Vitamix is a new juicer that claims to speed up the juicing process and leave a smoother, 'no bits' result. Good news for juicing fans.'

Nutritionist Madeleine Shaw, who works with Millie Mackintosh, said: 'Vitamix is awesome, it is obviously the best of the bunch. However Kenwood are making some really good less expensive blenders too.'

Personal trainer: James Duigan of Bodisym, who is credited with sculpting Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Elle Macpherson's bodies, is also a fan of the Vitamix blender

 Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who has one of showbiz's most enviable figures, recently praised her ‘delicious green juice' which she described as 'a 
great way to start the day.'

But what’s behind this mysterious 
concoction? Along with other super healthy ingredients such as cucumber,
 kale and parsley, the Japanese wholefood Chlorella is added to the 
juice.

And it’s not just Rosie 
who’s caught the Chlorella bug, Miranda 
Kerr has admitted that she takes Chlorella supplements to keep her skin 
in check.

green vegetable smoothie

Nadia Brydon, who’s a nutritionist and green food expert at Sun Chlorella, has shared her tips for the perfect morning smoothie....

'With everyone from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to Millie Mackintosh drinking green smoothies recently, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is just another beauty fad.

'We all know that we’re probably not eating enough greens, yet our greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat, and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy. 

Green smoothies can be high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness, and magnesium, which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature’s tranquiliser, helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it! 

You’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices, to up their nutrient intake even further. For instance, a daily serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun Chlorella contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a 32oz steak.

Perhaps most importantly, these drinks provide large quantities of whole food natural vitamins and minerals and help increase our daily intake of fruit and vegetables – for busy people who still want to remain healthy, this is hugely important.

Smoothies are also full of fibre and water along with a whole range of nutrients which naturally makes us feel fuller which reduces the desire to consume food generally especially sugar and carbohydrates. We recommend the Rolls Royce of blenders, the Vitamix blender, as it breaks down the cell walls of fresh, whole foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients. It also saves time as all of the ingredients can be added at once.'

Miranda and Rosie’s green juices and smoothies are so nutritious, simply because greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat, and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy. 

Combining these into an easy to drink smoothie can help busy people cram as many of these vegetables into their daily diet as possible. Juicing and blending raw green vegetables and living micro greens (sprouts) containing fresh vibrant green chlorophyll are extremely nutritious ways of creating optimum health and energy.

Just juice: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has revealed that she loves Chlorella (like those pictured right) green juices

Juicing or blending any raw green vegetable, especially the living leafy varieties, is an effective way of increasing oxygen in the body and helping to build healthy tissues. Oxygen maintains life and is a rejuvenator of all body systems.

Green smoothies containing the ingredients seen in Rosie and Miranda’s can be high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness.

The spinach in Rosie’s signature smoothie is high in magnesium, which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature’s tranquiliser, helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it! 

You’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices, to up their nutrient intake even further. For instance, a daily serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun Chlorella contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a 32oz steak – vitamin D in particular is important for winter, as this nutrient is produced by natural sunlight, and long cold winters can cause Brits to become deficient, meaning it’s important to top up where possible.   To make a Rosie or Miranda style green smoothie, try the delicious recipe below at home. Freshly juiced fruits should always be diluted 50:50 with water in order to dilute the sugar content.  Blend the below ingredients, adding the water first.•    600ml mineral water (still) •    ½ chopped cucumber (skin & pips included) •    ¼ peeled avocado •    1 chopped celery stick •    Juice of ½ lemon or lime •    ¼ teaspoon unrefined salt •    Sun Chlorella ‘A’ tablets: initially starting off with 5 tablets for the first three days, moving up to 10 for the next 3 days and then 15 tablets herein after. •    Small double handful (60-80mg) of mixed green leaves from the following (they can be combined): spinach, watercress, rocket, savoy cabbage, chard, lettuce, chicory, kale, bok choy, sprigs of mint, parsley, coriander, basil.
