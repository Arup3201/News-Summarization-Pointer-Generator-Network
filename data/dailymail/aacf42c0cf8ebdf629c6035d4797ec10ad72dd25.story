David Nugent's prolific pre-season continued as Leicester City swatted MK Dons aside on Monday evening, recording a comfortable 2-0 win with goals coming either side of the break.

Nugent, a one-time England international, put the visitors ahead at Stadium mk with a deflected effort from distance, and James Pearson, son of Leicester boss Nigel, increased their lead with a stonking strike into the top corner from 30 yards in the second half.

Leicester have now won four and drawn one during their run of pre-season games, as they prepare to play in the Premier League for the first time in a decade. 

The difference: Leicester goalscorer David Nugent, right, hassles Dele Alli in possession during the match

Nugent was at the heart of everything good about Leicester's play at Stadium mk. The former Portsmouth striker netted the opening goal of the game, provided the assist for Pearson's stunning second-half effort, and was handful for MK Dons' defence throughout.

As early as the fifth minute Nugent was causing problems, dropping deep before threading a pass out to Riyad Mahrez, whose cross then found Jeff Schlupp on the left. Only a decent stop from David Martin kept the score level.

MK Dons: Martin; Hodson (Baldock 74), Lewington (Tilney 74), McFadzean (Hickford 84), Kay (Tingey 84); Alli (Randall 69), Potter (Trialist A 69); Green, Bowditch (Powell 46), Reeves (Hitchcock 53); Afobe (Trialist B 69).

Subs not used: McLoughlin, Burns, Flanagan, Summerfield, Rasulo.

Leicester: Hamer, Pearson (McCourt 72), Morgan, Kennedy (Sesay 79), Hammond, King, Albrighton, Schlupp, Mahrez (Barmby 75), Wood, Nugent.

Subs not used: Logan, Cain, Blyth, Panyiotou.

Goals: Nugent 23, Pearson 67.

Attendance: 4,332. 

Not long after Leicester thought they were ahead when Chris Wood bundled home from close-range after Nugent had flicked an enticing cross from Marc Albrighton into his path. Despite the New Zealand striker's appeals the goal was chalked off, with Wood adjudged to have fouled goalkeeper Martin in the build-up.

Midway through the first half Pearson's side were deservedly in front. Nugent, with his back to goal, swiveled on to his left and let fly from 30 yards, the ball bouncing into the back of the net courtesy of a generous deflection.

Leicester continued to pepper the goal of their former player Martin, and the Dons' goalkeeper had to be alert to keep out efforts from Wood and Mahrez in quick succession. 

The hosts began to force the issue as the half progressed. Their exciting academy product Dele Alli fired an effort against the post in the 43rd minute, and seconds later put Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe through on goal, but Ben Hamer saved well.

Dons completed the loan signing of Afobe earlier on Monday, and there were encouraging signs for the club's fans as he and Alli struck up an immediate understanding going forward.   

The home side started the second half stronger, with Afobe's pace pinning Leicester's defence back. 

Good impression: Benik Afobe, right, played well on his MK Dons debut after joining from Arsenal on loan

In the 58th minute Afobe wasted their best chance of the game, when his touch let him down inside the area following a decent cross from Danny Green.

Only a goal-line clearance from Andy King stopped Afobe levelling the scores shortly after the hour mark, the Leicester midfielder hoofing the ball away from danger after the 21-year-old forward had shot at goal following a Green corner.

Despite MK Dons' dominance after the break it was Leicester that grabbed the second goal of the game - and what a goal it was.

That man Nugent's cross from the left was cleared only as far as Pearson. The right-back needed just a single touch to set himself, before hammering a shot into the top corner from 30 yards that prompted applause from both sets of supporters.

Five minutes later he departed to a standing ovation from the Foxes fans.

Dons introduced a couple of trialists late on, with Trialist A firing just over and then clearing off his own line within the space of a minute. 

Rotherham and Werder Bremen are next up for the Foxes, before they start their Premier League campaign against Everton on August 16.
