A council inspector visited an 'exceptionally bad' building site hours before a trench collapsed and killed a father-to-be - but did not report it because the work was almost finished.

The blunder emerged today at a second inquest into the death of Callum Osborne, who was 24 when he was buried alive more than three years ago in Swalecliffe, Kent.

Colleagues desperately tried to dig out mounds of earth from around the labourer, but he suffered heart failure and was pronounced dead at the scene. 

Crushed: Callum Osborne was 24 about to become a father when he was buried by a collapsing trench in Swalecliffe, Kent. Today an inquest heard a council officer said the site was 'exceptionally bad' hours earlier

Desperate: Colleagues tried to dig out mounds of earth from around the labourer, but he suffered heart failure and was pronounced dead on the building site - which it has emerged a council officer said was 'dodgy'

Today an inquest jury heard the site was visited by Canterbury City Council building inspector Julie Darbyshire earlier the same day.

She felt it was ‘dodgy’ - but did not report it to the Health and Safety Executive, she told the jury.

The 52-year-old said she took her decision because the work was almost finished, adding she did not have the power to shut down the site.

On the day of the accident in April 2011 Miss Darbyshire said she could only get inside by holding a fence before she saw the trench with material piled alongside it.

'I saw a young boy digging in the trench close to a small digger,' she told the hearing.

'It was up to his shoulders. I would say it was up to five feet.

'I thought to myself, "that looks dodgy". It was an exceptionally bad site.' 

Killed: Callum Osborne with his girlfriend Colette Scott, who was eight months pregnant when he died

The trench on the site, which was run by the Kent-based firm Coopers Services Ltd, was being dug to connect utility pipes from two new bungalows to the mains. 

The labourer from nearby Canterbury, whose girlfriend was eight months pregnant, was self-employed and had been working for the company laying pipes for just two days.

His girlfriend Colette Osborne, who gave birth to their daughter a month after his death, said he had texted her two hours before his death to say he had not been given a break.

She told the hearing: 'He said he hadn’t had a break yet. He said he was digging a trench and it was very deep.

'He’d spoken to me about trench collapses and said he wouldn’t work on a site where trenches were unsupported.'

Long investigation: Police at the scene of the accident, which happened more than three years ago

Rescue: An air ambulance attended but Mr Osborne was pronounced dead at the scene. The inquest continues

But the mother-of-three added: 'He was desperate for this job and would do anything to get it, including working in a trench without shoring.' 

The inquest, which is being held in Sandwich, Kent, is the second formal hearing into the tragedy.

The first collapsed in December 2012 without a conclusion, and a bid to finally resume the hearing in June this year was scuppered when an administrative blunder meant there were not enough jurors.

The inquest continues.
