While many government employees entered their third day of the shut down either furloughed or working without pay, President Obama sat for a photo shoot.

Photographer Tony Powell posted on his Facebook on October 2 that he would be shooting the president one-on-one the following day.

Today, he posted a photo from the shoot showing the president staring off into the distance in front of a white background.

Capturing the Obamas: It wasn't the first time that Powell shot the commander-in-chief. Above, pictures from a shoot this past April. He also shot the President for Washington Life magazine in 2009

Most of the people who commented on the picture were happy for their friend, but some took it as an opportunity to make a statement against the president.

'What...there are not enough pictures of B.O. already? #governmentwastefulspending' wrote Chuck Sizer.

Those upset with the president's photo shoot may not have been happy when he made a show of a sandwich run with Vice President Joe Biden today.Â 

Lunch hour: The president was accompanied by Vice President Biden on a rare walk off the White House property to grab lunch at Taylor Gourmet sandwich shop today

President Obama and Vice President Biden walked to Taylor Gourmet, one of the many DC restaurants giving a special discount to government workers on furlough.

The president used the opportunity to once again make a case for the Republican-controlled House to pass a short-term spending measure that would reopen the government without strings attached.

'This shutdown could be over today,' he said. 'We know there are votes for it in the House.'

Working lunch: During the outing, President Obama spoke with reporters about the hardships government workers face in a shutdown, and again asked for the House to vote on a short-term budget without demands

A sandwich to end the shutdown: Apparently, Taylor Gourmet is one of House Speaker John Boehner's favorite lunch spots

Obama reacted to a news report that quoted an anonymous senior administration official as saying that the White House was 'winning' in the clash over the shutdown, and that the length of the shutdown 'doesn't really matter to us.'

'There's no winning when families don't have certainty about when they are going to get paid next,' he said in response to a reporter's question.

Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, tweeted a hopeful message:

'Common ground: John Boehner really likes Taylor Gourmet.'
