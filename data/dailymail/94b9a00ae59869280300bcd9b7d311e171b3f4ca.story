A man has taken possibly one of the best outback selfies ever.

The video posted on YouTube shows him driving alongside a huge red desert tornado... but all might not be as it seems.

'It's really, really forming,' a man in a thick Aussie accent says in the one-minute video. 'That's one of the biggest ones I've seen in a few years', he chuckles.

'Far out,' he yells before unbuckling his seatbelt and yelling to the camera: 'I'm f***ing running into this thing'.

An Australian man appeared to jump out of his car to take a selfie with a desert tornado in the outback

As he gets closer he shouts: 'Jesus Christ that is huge'.

The dust devil rapidly catches up with him and he turns running and swearing back to his car.

He films the swirling floor as he frantically dashes back to the safety of his vehicle after the apparent selfie stunt.

Huffing and panting he appears to climb into the car just as the tornado reaches him.

He spotted the 'dust devil' from his car and said it was one of the biggest ones he'd seen

He jumped back into his car screaming 'oh my God' as the tornado appeared to catch up with him

Dust appears to surround the windows and the car momentarily goes into darkness before the supposed tornado passes by.

'Oh my God, oh my God,' the guy pants as he readjusts the camera to show his face.

The video was uploaded by Terry Tufferson, the same man who uploaded footage of a man fighting off a great white shark in Sydney Harbour.

Unsurprisingly, some YouTube users have questioned if the video is real.
