Those effected were to quick to voice concerns on social media, prompting the phone carrier to fix the inconvenience. 

'Got up at 4am for 5:30 flight, only thanks to @Optus it was 3am,' one user wrote on Twitter. 'At the airport super early. Cafe isn't open yet, but there's lots of happy @Optus customers #ROFL.'

'Thanks for my rude awakening an hour early Optus, struggling at work today! #optuswrongtime,' another wrote.

One user poked fun at Optus' advertising campaign 'Yes' when he wrote: 'Seems like a lot of people in Brisbane this morning will be saying 'no'.'

'No word yet on whether Optus will be offering compensation for confused cows, or faded curtains,' another posted.

The issue has since been fixed, according to an Optus spokesperson.
