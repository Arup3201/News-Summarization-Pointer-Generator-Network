Women GPs who only work part-time after having children place a ‘tremendous burden’ on the NHS, according to a Tory MP.

Anne McIntosh claims 70 per cent of medical students are female and will only work a few days a week once they qualify.

She warned that the cost of training these doctors – just under £250,000 a head – ‘is going to put a huge burden on the health service’.

Pressure: The growth in the number of female doctors has 'unintended consequences' because they get married and have children, health minister Anna Soubry said (file picture)

The MP for Thirsk and Malton, North 
Yorkshire, a qualified lawyer, was supported by health minister Anna 
Soubry who agreed there would be ‘unintended consequences’.

But senior female doctors said she was
 making an ‘unfair accusation’ against thousands of women GPs doing an 
‘extremely demanding job’.

The latest official figures from the 
Royal College of Physicians puts the number of female medical students 
at 56 per cent and in the next decade women are expected to outnumber 
their male colleagues for the first time.

The proportion of women entering the profession has increased by 50 per cent since 2001.

Mrs McIntosh was speaking during a House of Commons debate yesterday on the controversial NHS 111 helpline.

She recounted how she had called the 
service for advice about her elderly father but had ‘hung up in sheer 
frustration’ because she ‘wasn’t getting anywhere’.

The MP said it was ‘particularly 
poignant’ that her father – a retired GP who had ‘worked all hours’ – 
could not see a doctor in his own hour of need.

She went on to imply 
that the shortage of GPs may partly be due to the high proportion of 
women working part-time.

She said women doctors were 
‘well-educated and well-qualified but when they go into practice, many 
marry and have children … and they then often want to work part-time.

‘Training what effectively might be two GPs working part-time obviously puts a tremendous burden on the health service.’

Anna Soubry said: ‘She makes an important point about the unintended consequences of the number of women training as doctors.’

The health minister was later forced to clarify her remarks and issued a statement saying she ‘fully supported women GPs’.
