Danny Lennon has thrown his hat into the ring for the Ross County job after Derek Adams became the first managerial casualty of the new season on Thursday.

The former St Mirren boss was immediately installed as 3/1 favourite for the vacancy in Dingwall following the shock sacking of Adams and his father George, County’s director of football.

And Lennon, who won the League Cup with the Buddies in 2013 but was replaced as manager by assistant Tommy Craig in May, expressed his interest  by describing the Victoria Park outfit as ‘a model club.’

Slump: Ross County have lost four consecutive league games this season

Former Inverness boss Terry Butcher will also be a strong tip, but Lennon said: ‘It is an attractive proposition and it certainly interests me. I spent time at Ross County towards the tail end of my (playing) career and it is a lovely place with lovely people.

‘The northerly location might put some off, others might be put off by the success Derek Adams had and think he’s taken Ross County as far as they can go.

‘Personally, I think a great foundation has been laid for someone to go and pick that up and take over. They have a great stadium, great facilities and, in many ways, they are a model club.

Despite four straight defeats in the Premiership, Adams launched a spirited defence of his Ross County record after being told on Wednesday night that he was being dismissed.

Chairman Roy MacGregor said terminating the Adams’ contracts was the most difficult decision he had made in football, but hinted that a breakdown in relations was a key factor. Coach Steve Ferguson and captain Richie Brittain will take charge for tomorrow’s game with Hamilton.

A bitterly disappointed Adams released a statement citing his pride in taking County up through the divisions to the Premiership and to a Scottish Cup final on a budget substantially lower than top-tier rivals.

Defiant: Derek Adams defended his record in a statement following his release

‘I have always believed the test of a manager is in consistently outperforming his resources and I believe I achieved that with Ross County,’ it read.

‘I have watched with immense pride as Ross County has grown from the Scottish Second Division through two promotions to the Scottish Premiership, where we are now in our third season.

‘The fact we achieved this progress while setting an unbeaten record in Scottish league football for the modern era of 40 matches and reaching a Scottish Cup final along the way gives my coaching team and myself great satisfaction.

‘Considering that Ross County has had I believe one of the lowest, if not the lowest, wage bills in the league in the last couple of seasons, I believe this shows our David has notched victories against the Goliaths of Scottish football more often than we might have reasonably expected.

‘This is most clearly demonstrated by our victories against Celtic, especially in the Scottish Cup semi final when at that time we were a First Division side.

‘As part of the financial realities of working at Ross County, I have become accustomed to working in a challenging environment.

‘For the last few seasons while working with a low wage budget, we have had to build almost entirely new teams to start each season without ever spending a transfer fee - a massive challenge that we have been able to meet by retaining our Premiership status.

Family affair: Derek Adams father George was also sacked as director of football

‘While this has been extremely challenging, I believe it makes the journey we have taken even more remarkable and I am very proud to have been a part of it.’

Chairman MacGregor surprised journalists with an unscheduled appearance at a routine press conference due to be attended by Adams yesterday, before admitting ‘chemistry’ had been a factor in the dismissals.

Declining to expand on his reasons, the club owner paid tribute to both Derek and George Adams, but admitted he is likely to scrap the director of football role.

‘We have nothing in mind,’ said the County chairman.’We have to sit down and look at it. There is no deadline.

‘Will it be a director of football and manager again? I doubt that will happen. It will be a different relationship. By and large it worked for us, but it is very unusual nowadays in Scottish football.’
