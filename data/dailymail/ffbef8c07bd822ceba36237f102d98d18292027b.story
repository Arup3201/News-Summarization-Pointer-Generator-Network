A nurse who called her black housemate an 'a***hole' apologised today but claimed the word is a 'figure of speech in Scotland'.

Anne Gallacher is also accused of slapping the woman and making racist comments about black people and foreigners, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

Gallacher, who works at the Princess Elizabeth Hospital in Guernsey, admitted calling the woman an a***hole and saying ‘the black girls in the lounge’, but denies that this was racist.

Nurse Anne Gallacher called her housemate an 'a***hole' - which she claims is a figure of speech in Scotland - because she feared she was going to call the police

‘I did call her an a***hole,’ she told the hearing. ‘I was frightened of her phoning the police.

‘I’m sorry, I apologise, but I called her an a***hole. It’s a figure of speech in Scotland. I didn’t mean it in a bad way.

‘The police arrived and asked if it was me who had phoned about the disturbance and I said, no, it was the three black girls in the lounge.

‘I wasn’t trying to be derogatory and I didn’t say it because of their skin colour.’

The row began in the communal lounge of their accommodation on Route de Cobo, Castel, Guernsey on June 4, 2011.

Gallacher and her boyfriend entered the room where the woman was sitting with two friends.

The hearing heard the boyfriend began threatening the housemate and she called the police.

Gallacher is then accused of slapping the woman in the face, though she claimed she was trying to push the phone away.

‘She was hysterical and I was trying to get the phone away from her ear and try to get her to calm down and stop phoning the police,' the nurse said.

‘I reached over and wanted to move the phone away. I don’t remember if I touched the phone - in the heat of the moment it’s possible I could have.

‘It’s possible I may have touched her face but I don’t believe I did.

‘If I did touch her face I would class it as assault, if I did touch her face it was an accident.

‘I did lean across but I didn’t slap her. I wanted to try and stop her phoning the police, there was no intention of hitting or slapping.’

When questioned about changing her story, Gallacher said that the transcript from the police interview was wrong and later admitted lying to officers.

‘I don’t think it has been typed up properly - they have misunderstood some of my words,’ she said.

Rachel Ellis, for the NMC, accused Gallacher of hurling racist abuse at the woman and her friends.

‘She was crying and you started mocking her,' Ms Ellis said. ‘The reason she was crying is because you assaulted her.

‘It’s correct that you leaned across, slapped her in the face and pushed her shoulder.

‘You were convicted of assaulting her at Guernsey Magistrates Court, you pleaded not guilty and gave evidence and the judge was satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that you assaulted her.’

The housemate told the hearing: ‘She managed to slap me on my left side.

‘I just couldn’t believe she had hit me and she started singing "you hit me, you hit me - I should have hit you until you were black and blue you f****** c***, you a***hole".'

Gallacher, originally from Glenrothes, Fife, then went on to talk about ‘you lot taking over the place’, the woman claimed.

‘She was just speaking to anyone that would listen to her - police and other nurses that were there. With her arms she was gesturing into the room,’ she said.

‘I have never seen her with a face like that before. She was more like snarling at me - it was like nobody mattered.’

Gallacher is also accused of racially motivated abuse to another woman known as Miss B, after allegedly saying ‘these foreigners are taking over the house’ and referring to ‘all of the black people’ on an unknown date.

The Scottish nurse was found guilty of assaulting Ms A - but claims the attack was racially motivated were dismissed.

Judge Philip Robey said while Gallacher was aggressive and abusive, the assault was a minor one and imposed a bind over order to be of good behaviour for two years.

She was previously convicted of disorderly conduct and fined £600 at Guernsey Magistrates Court on 9 August 2010.

Gallacher was also convicted of driving while unfit and resisting or obstructing police at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court on 29 June 2004.

On that occasion she was put on probation for 18 months, disqualified from driving for four years and ordered to pay £300.

The hearing continues.
