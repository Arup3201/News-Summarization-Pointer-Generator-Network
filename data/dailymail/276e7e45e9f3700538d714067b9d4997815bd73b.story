Russian prosecutors are examining shocking footage of a football coach kicking a seven-year-old boy in the air during a Lokomotiv Moscow youth match.

Valentin Pavlov claimed he was teaching the boy how to kick the ball properly after he failed to show enough commitment in a tackle against Brateevo Moscow.

He then ordered the frightened child to get back into the game.

The Moscow Football Federation has branded the training drill incident 'outrageous'

The powerful Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI, is deciding whether to bring charges for cruelty against Pavlov, but the coach claims his kick looked worse than it was.

The Moscow Football Federation branded the incident 'outrageous'.

'I was explaining to the child how to use his foot in a more robust manner,' claimed the coach, who claimed the camera was at the wrong angle.

'I started showing him - and just then the child jumped. So I sort of touched him, and he flipped in the air.

'Of course, there was not even a slightest intention to hurt him. This is a coincidence.

'He fell down in a theatrical manner so that it looked like he was hurt. The person who filmed it was lucky to catch this angle.'

Pavlov is the father of two daughters, one of whom plays in his team, and he claimed he filmed his club Maximum-Brateevo's training sessions as proof there was no undue physical force or beating of children.

While he did not apologise to the boy after the kick, he claims he has done so since.

The footage has caused outrage in Russia, but it was unclear today whether the boy's parents have complained.

Without a complaint, the Investigative Committee may not take further action.
