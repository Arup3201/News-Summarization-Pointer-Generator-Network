Four U.S. soldiers were killed by a suicide bomber today as they took pictures and went sightseeing in an Afghanistan park.

Witnesses said the bomber walked up to the troops, who had been warned by locals 'not to roam around the city', screamed 'Allahu Akbar' and then detonated a suicide vest.

Four civilians and two Afghan policemen were also killed in the midday explosion in the northern city of Maymana.

It is the latest in a string of attacks, as militants continue trying to undermine U.S. efforts to to build up the Afghan military and leave combat duties to local forces by the end of 2014.

Graphic video footage of the scene of the attack, available on YouTube, showed what appeared to be dead Afghan civilians, police and foreign troops at the explosion site.

Body parts were strewn around the gate and on the ground, and blood was spattered everywhere.

Faryab is relatively calm, but considered to be a stronghold of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, an Al Qaeda affiliated group most active in the northern provinces of Afghanistan.

On March 26, a joint Afghan and coalition force killed the group's leader in Afghanistan Makhdum Nusrat and detained two other insurgents.

The coalition said Nusrat had been leading attacks against Afghan and coalition troops in the north for the past eight months and was plotting the assassination of a member of parliament in Kabul.

The IMU was formed in 1991, originally aiming to set up an Islamic state in Uzbekistan, which borders Afghanistan.

Later it expanded its goal to seeking an Islamic state across Central Asia.

Militants have also stepped up their attacks against international and Afghan troops nationwide in recent weeks.

Nine Afghan policemen were killed and 11 abducted across the nation in the past three days.

Fighting in Afghanistan usually wanes during the winter months as Taliban fighters take a break because of winter weather, only to surge in the spring.

Heavy snow covers many of the mountain passes used by the Taliban and other insurgent fighters to cross mainly into eastern Afghanistan from safe havens in neighbouring Pakistan.

Anger against foreign forces has also risen following a series of missteps, including the inadvertent burning of copies of the Muslim holy book and other religious materials in February and the massacre of 17 Afghan civilians allegedly by a rogue U.S. soldier.

Foreign troops also have found themselves increasingly targeted.

So far this year, 97 NATO service members have been killed in Afghanistan, including at least 52 Americans.

Germany and Norway, who have troops in the region, said that none of their soldiers were involved. Germany commands alliance operations in the region.
