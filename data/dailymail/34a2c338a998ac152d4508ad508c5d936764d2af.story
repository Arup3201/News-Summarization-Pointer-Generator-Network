It was billed as the must-see music event of the year – but the BBC’s wall-to-wall coverage of Glastonbury Festival left many viewers reaching for the remote.

Amid criticisms the Corporation’s coverage was ‘inane, vacuous and sycophantic’, more people chose to watch a repeat of 1995 action film Die Hard With A Vengeance than tune in to the Rolling Stones’ headline gig on BBC2.

Almost 300 BBC presenters, editors and technicians were sent to the four-day event in Somerset at a cost of £2million.

The real deal: The Rolling Stones' live performance drew crowds of more than 170,000. But a repeat of Die Hard 3 attracted a larger TV audience

Distraction: Critics said the BBC's coverage took away from the live music. £2 milllion was spent to send almost 300 BBC presenters and technicians to Glastonbury

The Corporation provided 
more than 250 hours of coverage on TV and radio, plus a continuous live 
stream online, making the festival almost impossible to ignore. 

For
 about an hour on Saturday night, it was televised simultaneously on 
BBC2, BBC3 and BBC4. It was also covered in the main evening news 
bulletin on BBC1 just minutes earlier.

And
 even those who prefer hymns to rock and roll were unable to avoid it as
 BBC1’s Songs of Praise had a festival-themed edition yesterday, 
including a pre-recorded interview with Glastonbury organiser Michael 
Eavis.

Fans who were keen 
to see the performances also complained that the BBC’s presenters were 
‘annoying’ and filled the airwaves with ‘boring chit chat’ which 
distracted from the live music.

The highlight of the event was the 
Rolling Stones’ two-hour set on Saturday – but the BBC was allowed to 
broadcast only the last hour of it after a rights dispute.

A
 euphoric live audience – including Kate Moss, Stella McCartney and 
Prince Harry – watched. Fan John Simmons, 29, said: ‘They were out of 
this world. The best I have ever seen at Glastonbury’.

Saturday night appeal: Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis star in Die Hard With A Vengeance

But it seems the BBC’s TV audience were less keen. Throughout the evening, an average of 1.28million viewers watched, peaking at 2.54million as the Stones began their set.

By comparison, an average audience of 2.78million tuned in to a repeat of Die Hard, starring Bruce Willis, on BBC1.

On Saturday afternoon, the figures were even worse.

Just 800,000 watched the festival, compared with 2.6million who tuned in to Wimbledon on BBC1 and 849,000 who watched Midsomer Murders on ITV.

A BBC spokesman said the BBC2 viewing figures were around three times higher than the average for the timeslot and said the BBC’s Glastonbury website picked up an extra one million unique users as others tuned in online.

Festival fanatic Heidi Wesson, 33, from Leicester gave birth at the event’s medical centre just after the Rolling Stones’ set on Saturday.

The Tesco customer services officer and her new daughter were ‘fine and fabulous’, according to partner Sean Crothers.
