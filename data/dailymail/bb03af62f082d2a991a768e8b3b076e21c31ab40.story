It's always going to be a day to remember. But one husband wanted to make sure his wedding day was one his new bride would never forget.

Sean Rajaee, from Santa Barbara, California, put together a five-minute dance routine - taking in his other half's favourite songs.

The footage of the choreography, which some of the groomsmen had to learn via video tutorials, has been uploaded to YouTube, where it's been watched more than 666,000 times.

Kicking off with Crazy In Love, Sean and his groomsmen can be seen in the video taking to the dance floor, where they shake their moves to a montage of tracks as the bride sits on a chair.

The watching guests erupt into cheers when the first notes of Beyonce's song are played, and Sean and his seven good-humoured friends break into a (nearly) perfectly synchronised ‘booty shake’.

As the music moves on to Bootylicious, it becomes clear that while the dancing may not be quite professional standards, the performance is a touching labour of love.

Performed with some serious enthusiasm, the men don shades to serenade the bride, with a song by her favourite band, Backstreet Boys’ ballard I Want It That Way.

The performance ends - with shrieks from the audience - with Bruno Mars' Marry You.

Sean, an Orthopedic Surgery Resident at Cedar Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, presents a rose to his overwhelmed bride, Ariana, and the two, both in their late 20s, share a tender kiss as the watching crowd cheers.

The footage was uploaded to YouTube by Sean's sister Shirin Rajaee, who is a news anchor for ABC KEYT Santa Barbara.

Shirin wrote on YouTube: 'My brother Sean Rajaee surprised his bride with a choreographed American/Persian groomsmen dance at his wedding June 21, 2014.

'The dance started off with a Beyonce song then went into the bride (Ariana's) favorite boy band the Backstreet Boys and ended with the Bruno Mars song Marry You.

'The group even included a fun Persian dance number.

'Some of the groomsmen flew in from across the country and had to learn the routine last minute and via video tutorial.

'The bride, Ariana, was in shock and so were all the guests.'

She added: 'I posted the video because it was so good I wanted to share it, but I never knew it would blow up as fast as it has.

'My brother's dance moves takes me back to our childhood days when I'd have him listen to my favorite groups, Nysnc and Beyonce.

'Our next goal is to get these guys to perform on the Ellen Show!'

The suited eight eventually ditch stick-on facial hair for the final song, Bruno Mars ‘Marry Me’, for which the groomsmen form an arch through which Sean, who lives in Los Angeles, dances down holding a red rose.
