West Brom's Chris Brunt has requested a personal hearing after being charged by the Football Association for allegedly verbally abusing a match official.

The midfielder is alleged to have used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour in the tunnel after Saturday's 2-0 FA Cup quarter final defeat to Aston Villa.

A Baggies statement published on Friday read: 'Chris Brunt has requested a personal hearing after being charged by The Football Association.

'The midfielder will continue to be available for selection, including Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash against Stoke, until a date for the hearing is finalised.'

Referee Anthony Taylor sent off Albion's Claudio Yacob and Villa's Jack Grealish during the game, which sent Villa through to the semi finals where they will play Blackburn or Liverpool.

An FA statement on Brunt, released on Monday, said: 'It is alleged that in or around the tunnel area after the end of the fixture the player used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards a match official.'

Both Albion and Villa are also awaiting the results of FA and police investigations after crowd trouble at Villa Park where home fans twice invaded the pitch.

Aston Villa fans celebrated by racing on to the pitch following their 2-0 victory over West Brom at Villa Park

Seats were thrown from the West Brom section in the North Stand into the Villa fans during the second half with boss Tony Pulis insisting anyone found guilty should be banned for life.

It was the second time the teams had played each other in a week after Villa's 2-1 Premier League win.
