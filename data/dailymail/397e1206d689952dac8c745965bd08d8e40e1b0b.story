It's a day when the line between the life and death is blurred. 

The Day of the Dead is a Latin American tradition that coincides with All Saints Say and All Souls Day on 1 and 2 November. 

The festival is joyously celebrated in Mexico, with families decorating the graves of departed relatives with marigolds and candles. 

Participants also paint their faces to resemble skeletons, and create elaborate headgear, usually made from feathers.
