A grade I listed manor where Oliver Cromwell's daughter Elizabeth once lived with her husband has been put on the market for £1,800,000.

The political leader frequently visited Northborough Manor, Peterborough, to see his favourite daughter and husband John Claypole who first moved into the property after the English Civil War - which ended in 1651.

According to some reports, Cromwell even spent a Christmas at the Manor, which comprises of two buildings - a eight-bedroom main manor and a separate four-bedroom Gatehouse.

For sale: Northborough Manor, where Elizabeth Cromwell and her husband John Claypole lived after the English Civil War, is for sale for £1.8million

Historical: The grade one listed, 14th century manor comprises of two properties - the main house, pictured, and a separate Gatehouse

Welcome: Visitors to the property, about seven miles from Peterborough, enter through the Gatehouse, pictured, and park in the courtyard - seen through the arch

Heritage: Both properties were built in between 1333 and 1336 by William de Eyton for Roger de Norburgh, who received the estate in the 14th Century

During his visit, he slept in a room now referred to as 'Cromwell's closet'. His wife - also called Elizabeth - later died in that very room.

According to the current owners, the ghost of Elizabeth has reportedly been seen walking in the courtyard at midnight - but they say they have never experienced any ghostly encounters.

The historical property also has links to US, as John Claypole's brothers were involved in the early settlement of the state of Pennsylvania - recognised in 1975 by the Govenor of the State who presented a flag to be flown at the property.

Now on the market for £1.8m, estate agents Smiths Gore say the property has been popular with those interested in period homes with a wealth of historical background.

Architectural: The property has numerous feature windows and doors, pictured, that would have originally be installed in the early 1300s

Expansive: The main property, lived in by the Claypoles who acquired the Manor in the 1600s, boasts a fabulous two-storey dining room called the Great Hall

Links: In the Great Hall, the state flag of Pennsylvania is flown, pictured, after it was presented to the family in 1975 because of links between the Claypoles and the state

Cosy: Coming off the dining hall, pictured right, is the home's library - stocked with books, stored on floor-to-ceiling shelves

Ornate: The Manor's large sitting and entertaining room, pictured, called The Solar has been popular with people viewing the historical building

They added that they have shown a number of clients round the property - which boasts a library, beautifully kept 1.5-acre gardens including a 16th century Dovecote and stables - many of whom are city-types who wish to commute to London.

The stunning property, with features a 'great hall' used as a formal dining room, is 10 miles from the Georgian market town of Stamford, while Peterborough mainline station is seven miles away.

The property is currently lived in by John and Jane Trevor who are down-sizing as their children have now grown up.

They said: 'We fell in love with the property and the history behind it. It is very rare these days to find a home with so much historical background attached to it.

Culinary: The property has a relatively modest farm-house style kitchen with room for a dining table, should prospective buyers not fancy eating in the Great Hall

Upstairs: The home's master bedroom features original beams, beautifully renovated by architect Roy Genders in the seventies

Modest: Meanwhile over at The Gatehouse, the dining area is substantially less palatial, but still echos the distinctive style of the property

'We have loved living here but now we are too old and our children are grown ups.

'There are stories that Elizabeth - Cromwell's widow - walks the courtyard at midnight. But we have never experienced it. It's rubbish. This is the friendliest house in the country and a wonderful place to live.'

The Manor was built between 1333 and 1336 by Roger de Norburgh who received the Estate in early 14th Century.

Wealthy de Norburgh was Chancellor of Cambridge University, Canon of Lincoln and Hereford and Bishop of Litchfield and Coventry. Although the manor was not his official residence, he built the property to be what was in effect a Bishop's Palace.

Fit for any serviceman: The sitting room in The Gatehouse, which would have originally been built for the estate's staff

Private: The home has around 1.5-acres of secluded gardens that have been kept to a very high standard

Estate: As well as stables, the grounds, which are enclosed, also featuer a Dovecote built in the 1500s by the Claypole family

Peaceful: The property was originally bought by the Claypole family in 1572, but John and Elizabeth did not move in until after the Civil War

Special visitor: A portrait of Oliver Cromwell who is said to have regularly visited the manor to stay with his daughter and in-laws

It is thought that William de Eyton, the Master Mason and Architect of Litchfield Cathedral, built the Manor.

Over the next 200 years, it was passed between owners before it was bought by James Claypole in 1572.

Claypole extended the Gatehouse for his staff and built the Dovecots. He also built a tomb in the local church before his death in 1599.

It was his great grandson, also called John, that married Elizabeth Cromwell during the Civil War in 1646.

After the war, which ended in 1651, Elizabeth and John moved to Northborough to live with the Claypoles.

Cronwell visited the couple regularly there - spending one Christmas at the Manor as he and John's father were old friends.

One of the rooms is now called 'Cromwell's Closet' - a room over the south porch - as he slept in the room while visiting.

After Oliver died in 1658, his widow - also called Elizabeth - moved to live at the Manor. She is thought to have died in 1665 in 'Cromwell's Closet.'

John Claypole's brothers Edward, James and Norton emigrated and played a role in the early settlement of the state of Pennsylvania.

The link to Northborough was recognised 
officially by the Governor of the State in 1975 when the State flag was 
presented to be flown at the Manor.

One of the Claypole brother's descendents was a friend of George Washington. He is thought to have printed the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the Unites States and Washington's Farewell Address to the American People.

John Claypole sold the Manor before his death in 1688.

The Manor eventually became a farmhouse and was restored to its current glory in the early 1970s by architect Roy Genders.

After the English Civil War, which ended in 1651, Elizabeth and John moved to Northborough to live with the older members of the Claypole family.

Former Prime Minister Cromwell visited the couple regularly there - spending a Christmas at the Manor.

It is thought that as well as the obvious family links, he and John's father were old friends.

The political leader stayed in a room now called 'Cromwell's Closet' - a modest room above the south porch.

After
Oliver died in 1658, his widow - also called Elizabeth - moved to live 
at the Manor.

She died in 1665 in 'Cromwell's 
Closet.'

As well as links to British history, the Manor has links to the US.

John Claypole's 
brothers Edward, James and Norton emigrated and are believed to have played a role in the 
early settlement of the state of Pennsylvania.

The link between the brothers an Northborough Manor was recognised 
officially by the Governor of the State in 1975 when the State flag was 
presented to the then owners of the property.

The flag is now flown at the Manor.

Furthermore, one
of the Claypole brother's descendents was a friend of George 
Washington.

He is thought to have printed the Declaration of 
Independence, the Constitution of the Unites States and Washington's 
Farewell Address to the American People.

John Claypole sold the Manor before his death in 1688.
