Maureen Broadbent, 59, died from a blood clot just two days after medics sent her home from hospital saying nothing was wrong

A grandmother died from a blood clot just two days after medics sent her home from hospital saying nothing was wrong despite showing danger signs in tests.

Maureen Broadbent, 59, from Leeds started suffering shortness of breath and heart palpitations after undergoing a knee operation in April last year. 

She was admitted to Leeds General Infirmary by her GP in June 2013, but staff said her blood tests were normal and sent her home where she collapsed and died from a pulmonary embolism.

Her family have instructed medical negligence lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate after a coroner ruled in November this year that a risk assessment was 'inadequately completed'.

The inquest at Wakefield Coroners' Court found there were 'subtle signs' of pulmonary thromboembolism - a blood clot in the artery that carries blood to the lungs - when she was admitted to the hospital.

Daughter Michelle Pickup said: 'The anger does not let us move on. We still have no answers as to exactly what happened or why it went wrong.

'It was not her time and it shouldn't have happened. She was not ill, her death was because of something which could have been avoided.'

Mrs Broadbent had a knee replacement operation at Chapel Allerton Hospital in April last year.

The surgery was a success but a few months later she started to experience symptoms including heart palpitations and shortness of breath.

She visited her GP twice and after the second visit in June 2013 she was admitted to Leeds General Infirmary for further tests.

The next day, she was told her test results were normal and was sent home.

But two days later she collapsed at the home she shared with her partner Derek Bell and could not be saved. 

Coroner David Hinchliffe said a risk assessment was 'inadequately completed' and the results of a blood test should have led to further procedures which would have diagnosed the condition.

He said this was a 'missed opportunity' and that Mrs Broadbent should not have been discharged home because treatment may have prevented her death.

Mrs Pickup said: 'Our mum is irreplaceable - to say her death came as a shock doesn't even come close.

'It has totally devastated our family, and to think that she could be with us today if she'd been given the proper medical care makes it even more difficult to cope with.

'We don't know what the hospital have implemented or what changes have occurred. We also want to ensure that any lessons are shared across the NHS so that no other families have to suffer like ours has.'

A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We are extremely sympathetic to the family of Mrs Broadbent and fully understand the distress they must be feeling.

'A detailed investigation was carried out by the trust following Mrs Broadbent's sad death. This identified lessons to be learned, which have been shared with staff and have been subsequently audited to ensure they are being complied with.'

Katie Warner, a specialist medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell's, said: 'Maureen's entire family are understandably very distressed by their loss and have asked us to investigate whether Maureen's death could have been avoided if appropriate and timely treatment had been provided.

'We would like to thank the Coroner for taking the time to investigate the circumstances surrounding Maureen's death.

'We will continue to investigate the processes and procedures used at the hospital as Maureen's family are keen to ensure that lessons are learnt so that no other families have to lose their loved ones in such tragic circumstances.'

A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs.

This blockage – usually a blood clot – is potentially life threatening, as it can prevent blooFact-box text 

The symptoms of a pulmonary embolism can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals.
