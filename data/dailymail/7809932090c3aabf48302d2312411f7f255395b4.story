The age-old problem of spreading butter straight from the fridge has finally been solved - thanks to this nifty new kitchen gadget.

The revolutionary device looks like a normal cutlery knife but it has been made with 21 triangular holes down the blade that 'grate' the butter.

The tiny strips are much easier to spread than a knife loaded with cold butter so sandwich fans can finally avoid tearing holes in their bread trying in vain to get an even coating.

Grate invention: The gadget aims to solve the age-old problem of spreading butter straight from the fridge

The other side of the knife has a serrated edge so that it can be used to cut the sandwich or toast in half or get rid of the crusts.

Until now, the only way to guarantee a smooth spread has been to take the chilled butter out of the fridge and let it warm up on the side.

The stainless steel gadget, called the ButterUp, is the brainchild of friends Sacha Pantschenko, 29, Norman Oliveria, 27, and Craig Andrews, 48.

Mr Pantschenko, from Sydney, Australia, said: 'The idea of finding a better way to spread butter was bounced around between the three of us and we came up with this.

Butter than never: The other side of the knife has a serrated edge so that it can be used to cut the sandwich or toast in half or get rid of the crusts. Until now, sandwich lovers had to wait for butter to melt before spreading

'We realised that there was something really valuable and cool here.

'The ButterUp works by turning the butter into small ribbon shapes which creates more surface area that becomes easier to spread.

'It works best on butter that has been kept in the fridge as we have found it doesn't curve as easily when it is room temperature.

'We have tried to keep it as simple as possible so that anyone can use it, including children.

'This is a time saving gadget because you don't have to wait for the butter to reach room temperate before you use it and stops you from tearing up the bread.'

The team have launched the ButterUp on Kickstarter where they hope to raise £21,000 ($34,990) for the manufacturing costs.

When it hits the shelves, they estimate it will be on sale for between £6 to £8 ($10 to $13.30).
