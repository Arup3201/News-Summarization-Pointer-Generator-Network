Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock admits the club must make 'two or three' signings in January to boost their chances of Barclays Premier League survival.

Palace have won just once in nine games ahead of a crucial Christmas period that includes matches against Manchester City, Southampton and fellow strugglers QPR.

Only two points currently separate the Eagles from the bottom three and Warnock believes it will be essential to strengthen the squad when the transfer window opens.

Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock admits he must bring in 'two or three' players during January 

'We've got to bring players in," said Warnock, whose side host Stoke on Saturday.

'Without knocking our players, they've got to be better than we've already got and it takes quite a lot of money to do that.

'We've got some good players so it's just trying to add two or three players to the squad that we've got to give us that bit more in depth.

'The substitutes' bench hasn't had a lot of players on it for me to change a game so that's something for the second half of the season, where we can look to influence the game by the substitutes.'

Palace have struggled for goals in recent games, scoring just once in their last three league outings.

Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha both impressed during a goalless draw at Tottenham last weekend but the Eagles lack enough cutting edge in the final third to snatch victory.

'I think we've known all along that we haven't got that clinical striker,' Warnock said.

'I think we've scored quite a few goals over the season but they just seem to be in spurts. When we score, we score three.

'We've got to start putting lesser chances away that would have earned us quite a lot more points.'

Defensive midfielder Mile Jedinak is the club's top scorer in the league this term with five goals, three of which came from the penalty spot.

Marouane Chamakh, Dwight Gayle and Fraizer Campbell have all struggled for form while experienced frontman Andrew Johnson has been sidelined with injuries.

Johnson's contract runs out in January and Warnock admits it will be a difficult decision whether to keep the 33-year-old.

'If he can get back to fitness he can do a job in the Premier League but it's a big question mark in the space of three weeks how fit he's going to be able to get," Warnock said.

'He's been unlucky, he's hurt his calf for the last few weeks and I'd just told him he was going to be on the bench for the Liverpool game and he pulled up in training, it's a blow to him.

'He's got a problem with his knee now - he was seeing someone this week and I'll know more about his problem later.'

Warnock added: 'He's fabulous around the place. It's good when they care and helping out with the youngsters.

'Unfortunately we all get older, you get these problems and you can't shake them off.'
