BT is the most complained about broadband provider for the first time according to new figures from industry watchdog Ofcom.

And Orange had the unhappiest pay-monthly mobile customers.

The level of complaints Ofcom received about BT was 0.32 per 1,000 customers while those for Orange the number was 0.12 per 1,000 customers.

BT generated the most complaints among broadband providers for the first time and Orange the most for pay-monthly mobiles, according to Ofcom

The good news however is that the number of complaints for phone and pay TV companies dropped in the last three months of 2013.

The level of customers unhappy with their pay monthly deal stays the same.

Most of the complaints against BT were about loss of service or unhappiness with the way those complaints were handled.
