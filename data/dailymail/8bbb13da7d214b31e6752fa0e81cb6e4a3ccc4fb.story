After Wednesday night's resounding 4-1 victory over Stoke, Manchester City had more to be cheerful about as Yaya Toure returned to training. 

The 31-year-old had been away with Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea, where the midfield powerhouse helped the Elephants to victory. 

City suffered in Toure's absence. Manuel Pellegrini's side managed just one win while the midfielder was with his national side, and that came on Wednesday against Stoke.

Since Toure left the Etihad, City had managed just three points from three draws in the Premier League before the 3-1 victory at the Britannia - and they crashed out of the FA Cup to Championship leaders Middlesbrough. 

Having scored his spot-kick in the Ivory Coast's 9-8 win over Ghana in the final, Toure looked ahead to City's challenge of retaining the title. 

‘With my confidence I know football is not about one game or two games, especially in the Premier League,’ he said.

‘We have 38 games and if we want to achieve it (retaining the title) we have to win all the games.

‘I know it is difficult but now I have to go back and do my duty again.’ 

The first opportunity to begin that difficult challenge will be on February 21 against Newcastle. 

Meanwhile, City's January £25million signing Wilfried Bony will not be able to train with his new club until Friday as the former Swansea striker had to renew his visa before returning from the Africa Cup of Nations.
