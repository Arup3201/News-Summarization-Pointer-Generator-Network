New research has found where defendants sit in court could influence a jury's verdict.

The study, by the University of Western Sydney, involved more than 400 mock jurors and examined how likely it was that panelists would return a guilty verdict if the defendant was seated in an enclosed glass dock, an open dock or beside their lawyer.

The study, featured on ABC's Lateline, compared the results from the three arrangements during a fake terrorism trial held in western Sydney.

The jurors were provided the same witnesses and evidence as was given in the terror related trial of the now infamous Khaled Sharrouf (centre left) and Mohamed Elomar (centre right) in 2009

In Australia, jurors are commonly seated in the glass dock, whereas the alternative options are favoured in America.

The jurors were provided the same witnesses and evidence as was given in the terror related trial of the now infamous Khaled Sharrouf and Mohammed Elomar in 2009, one of Australia's longest and most cases, which involved over 300 witnesses.

Glass boxes were removed from the case due to concerns they would sway the verdict of the jury members.

According to the study, 60 per cent of jurors delivered a guilty verdict when the defendant was in the glass dock, while 47 per cent in the open dock and 36 per cent when next to their lawyer.

The defendants furthermore said that the glass case defendants appeared inherently more nefarious.

David Tait, from the University of Western Sydney, told Lateline 'the impressions were that the accused was more dangerous, more violent and more threatening in the glass box.'

He said the results prove that the glass dock impairs the presumption of innocence.

The researchers hope the study will catalyse changes of the design of Australian courts.

The full results of the study will be presented in Melbourne on Friday.
