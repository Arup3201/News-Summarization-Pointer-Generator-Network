Suspect: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, is now in prison and his lawyers argue that the treatment he is receiving is overly harsh

The two men accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing spent the days and hours after the attack destroying evidence and building more bombs, it emerged today.

A memo from Attorney General Eric Holder revealed the details 
of what investigators allege the bombing suspects did after the April 15 attacks.

Holder wrote the letter to the bureau of prisons director to justify why the 'Special Administrative Measures' were imposed on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev after his lawyers said the 'overly harsh' restrictions placed on him in prison were unjustifiable.

Tsarnaev's lawyers said he has been 
confined to his cell except for visits from them and 'very limited 
access' to a small outdoor enclosure.

He is not allowed to receive mail or use the telephone.

They argued the conditions have left him nearly totally isolated and are impairing their ability to defend him.

Tsarnaev, 20, is accused of building and planting bombs near the finish line of the April 15 marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260.

'SAMs', as they are known, are used in 
terrorism cases and other high-profile cases when authorities allege 
there is 'substantial risk' that a defendant's communications or 
contacts with people 'could result in death or serious bodily injury' to
others.

The special restrictions were placed 
on shoe bomb suspect Richard Reid, 'American Taliban' John Walker Lindh 
and other terror suspects.

Tsarnaev's lawyers say prosecutors have presented no evidence that the special restrictions are needed in his case.

Horrific: After planting multiple bombs near the marathon finish line, the Tsarnaev brothers killed three people and injured more than 260 in the blasts

Faces in the crowd: Dzhokhar and his brother Tamerlan were tracked by police using surveillance footage, and Tamerlan was killed in the ensuing shoot out with police

The memo, obtained by the LA Times, claims Dzhokhar and his 
brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev - who was killed four days after the bombing -
spent much of their time after the bombing trying to get rid of evidence and reaffirming 
their Jihad beliefs.

Holder said that Tsarnaev discarded a 
remaining bomb detonator and smashed a cellphone he used to secretly 
communicate with his brother about the bombing.

When the younger brother was found hiding in a boat on, they were anti-America scrawlings on the inside.

'Tsarnaev's brother was killed in the 
drawn-out altercation while he evaded capture and hid inside a 
dry-locked boat in a residential neighborhood,' Holder wrote.

'While hiding he scrawled 
messages including "The U.S. government is killing our innocent 
civilians", "I cant stand to see such evil go unpunished", "We Muslims 
are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all".

'Following his capture, he was 
interviewed by the FBI and reaffirmed his commitment to Jihad and 
expressed hope that his actions would inspire others to engage in 
violent conduct. there is no evidence that his intentions have changed 
since.'Â 

The document also claims the pair made additional bombs after the marathon and persuaded others to destroy evidence.

Planned: The location of the bombs at the area full of foot traffic and awaiting pedestrians shows that their intent was to kill and injure as many as possible

The accused bomber's lawyers said his legal rights are being violated and said in their filing: 'The government has not alleged that 
Mr Tsarnaev has done or said anything since his arrest to commit 
violence, incite violence, or engage in communications that pose a 
security threat.

They
also said the special measures limit Tsarnaev's interaction with people
who are helping the defense and restrict the communications and other 
activities of the defense team.

Holder said Tsarnaev has received nearly 1,000 pieces of mail in prison, mostly from people who believe he is innocent.

Authorities say he and his older 
brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, ethnic Chechens from Russia who 
emigrated to the United States as children, planned and carried out the 
attack to retaliate against the United States for its involvement in 
Muslim countries.

Tamerlan was killed four days after the marathon following a gun battle with police.

Dzhokhar was found wounded and hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown.
