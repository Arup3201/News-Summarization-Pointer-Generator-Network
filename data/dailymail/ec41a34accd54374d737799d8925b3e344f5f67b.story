The death of an 11-year-old aboriginal girl with leukemia who died less than a year after her family allowed her to stop chemotherapy will be investigated by a local coroner. 

Makayla Sault, an Obijwa girl from New Credit First Nation reserve in Ontario, Canada, died on Monday after suffering a stroke the day before.

Her grief-stricken family blamed her death on the three-month course of chemotherapy she underwent last year for  leukemia, before she chose to stop the treatment.

In a statement, they said the young cancer sufferer had been improving with traditional healing methods but the chemotherapy had damaged her body.

Visions: Cancer-stricken Makayla Sault, who refused chemotherapy, said Jesus came to her and told her she was healed in this YouTube clip made in May. She died on Monday, her family said in a statement

Her parents, pastors Ken and Sonya Sault, told the Two Row Times: 'Makayla was on her way to wellness, bravely fighting toward holistic well-being after the harsh side effects that 12 weeks of chemotherapy inflicted on her body.

'Chemotherapy did irreversible damage to her heart and major organs. This was the cause of the stroke. We continue to support Makayla's choice to leave chemotherapy.

'At this time we request privacy from the media while we mourn this tragic loss. 

Makayla was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January 2014 and suffered weakness and nausea from the chemotherapy used to treat the cancer. 

The grueling weeks of the chemo sent her cancer into remission.

However doctors said that in order to rid Makayla of the cancer completely, she needed to undergo two years of treatment which would give her a 75 per cent chance of survival. 

Makayla's parents allowed their daughter to give up the chemo, a move that prompted doctors at McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton where Makayla was being treated to alert children's authorities.

The family were investigated by a division of Canada's Children’s Aid Society, who decided to allow them to continue to care for Makayla without requiring the chemotherapy treatments.

The office of the chief coroner in Ontario confirmed there was now an ongoing investigation into Makayla’s death, but a spokesman said it was a routine investigation sparked by the earlier Children’s Aid Society probe.

In May, Makayla read out a letter in a YouTube clip about how chemotherapy was 'killing' her body and that she saw a vision of Jesus who told her she was already healed.   

The Saults took Makayla home, weakened and 10lb lighter, to recover for two weeks after her first treatment.

'I have asked my mom and dad to take me off the treatment because I don't want to go this way anymore.

'I know that what I have can kill me, but I don't want to die in a hospital on chemo,' Mikayla said in the video.

During the two weeks respite from chemo, Makayla's parents started her on a different form of treatment, which has left her feeling 'awesome,' she said.

'I wish that the doctors would listen to me, because I live in this body and they don't,' she added.

Also during that time, Makayla said she had a vision of Jesus, flanked by two angels, who told her she was already healed, and not to be afraid. 

According to Two Row Times, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples asserts that indigenous people have the right to use traditional medicines and health care practices without discrimination.
