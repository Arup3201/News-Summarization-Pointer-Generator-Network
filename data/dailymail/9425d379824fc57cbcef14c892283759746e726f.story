The police officer who shot an unarmed teenager in his bathroom was expected to hand himself in to face manslaughter charges tomorrow.

Ramarley Graham, 18, was shot dead on February 2 after the NYPD followed him to his home and kicked down the door. 

Officer Richard Haste, 30, who has been a policeman for four years, is expected to be indicted on first- and second-degree manslaughter. He faces up to 25 years in prison for the death of the teenage boy in the Wakefield area of the Bronx.

Moments before the fatal shooting, an undercover narcotics unit said they spotted the teen adjusting his waistband and thought he had a gun.

He was followed into his apartment where he had been hiding in the bathroom before Officer Haste allegedly shot the young man.

Mr Graham had not been carrying a gun and no weapon was found at the scene. He was rushed to Montefiore Medical Center, where he later died.

It prompted calls of overly aggressive policing and mass protests in the Bronx community.

The Bronx District Attorney’s Office found that Haste not only didn't follow procedure, but broke the law by opening fire, according to the New York Post.

Attorney for the Graham family told the paper 'we expect an indictment and are waiting for it'.

At the time of her son's death his mother Constance Malcolm, 39, told the Daily News: 'They chased him into the house. Nobody deserves to be shot in their own home.'

Mr Graham did have a small amount of marijuana in his possession after he was spotted buying it on the street.

Once inside, he headed for the bathroom, apparently trying to flush marijuana he had away, with two officers behind him.

The police initially claimed a struggle had followed in which the teen was shot in the upper left chest.

However, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that he did not believe the officers had struggled with the suspect before he was shot. 

According to Mr Kelly’s account, as Mr Graham tried to flush drugs down the toilet, one of the officers yelled: 'Show me your hands! Show me your hands! Gun! Gun!'

That officer then shot him with his service weapon, a 9mm Glock.

'We need to continue to gather facts at this juncture,' Mr Kelly said. 'We see an unarmed person being shot. That always concerns us.'
