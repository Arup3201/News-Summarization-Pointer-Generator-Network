To a person with dyslexia, the world of words and numbers can appear jumbled and confused.

In a bid to try and explain exactly how dyslexics view pages in books, words on signs, and numbers, one sufferer has designed the ‘I wonder what it’s like to be dyslexic’ book. 

It shows how capitals can often get mixed up with lowercase letters, how words can become jumbled and the ways in which different fonts can affect how easy a word is to read.

Dyslexia symptoms vary from person to person but a common trait is that people with dyslexia read at levels significantly lower than other people their age.

The Dyslexia Research Trust claims that the main signs of dyslexia is difficulty reading and sufferers may reverse numbers and letters, and struggle with spelling.

Children who speak later than others, find rhyming words difficult and can't distinguish between word sounds may also have the condition.

Dylsexic children may also reach other milestones later, such as crawling, walking, throwing or riding a bike.

A dyslexic may be clumsier than their peers, often get left and right mixed up and have trouble concentrating.

The association additionally claims people with dyslexia are more likely to develop hay fever, asthma, eczema, and other allergies.

It also discusses the parts of the brain that deal with various tasks, such as identifying colours, and why dyslexia is considered a disability. 

Graphic design and typography graduate Sam Barclay developed the book to highlight the plight of dyslexics.

According to Barclay, people with dyslexia and other reading difficulties are often capable of thinking in ways others aren't and as a result are 'capable of true greatness', yet these people are often misunderstood and treated unfairly as a result.

‘Being dyslexic, I noticed that available help was always about making me read better,’ said Barclay.

‘Very little effort was made to help the people around me understand what it feels like.

‘My aim has been to create a beautiful design-led experience about what it feels like to struggle with reading.

‘I wanted this book to be equally at home on a coffee table as in a school classroom and a business environment.‘

Barclay continued that if just ‘one 
person with reading difficulties is understood, and as a result is 
treated fairly, we will have achieved ‘something amazing.' 

According to designer Barclay, people with reading difficulties are often capable of thinking in ways that others aren't and as a result are capable of greatness, yet are often misunderstood and treated unfairly as a result. He is hoping to educate people about dyslexia in his book, pictured

To fund his project and get the book published, Barclay has set up a Kickstarter campaign that runs until the 28 November.

His goal was to raise £14,500 and the campaign has exceeded this target reaching in excess of £16, 800. 

According to the British Dyslexia 
Association ten percent of the British population is dyslexic and 4 per
cent suffer from a severe form of the condition.

Dyslexia is a common type of 
specific learning difficulty that mainly affects the skills involved in reading and spelling.

The effects vary from person to 
person but a common trait is that people with dyslexia read at levels 
significantly lower than other people their age.

find rhyming words difficult to comprehend and can't distinguish 
between word sounds may also have the condition.

Barclay believes by helping staff to understand what it feels like for a colleague or customer to struggle with reading could improve business and productivity.

He also believes that educating parents, teachers and school children about dyslexia could help boost the self-esteem of sufferers.

Talking about the design of the book, Barclay said: ‘Manipulating language through the use of typography has always appealed to me.

‘What interests me, is the challenges of generating an outcome that questions the users experience in the most exciting way.’
