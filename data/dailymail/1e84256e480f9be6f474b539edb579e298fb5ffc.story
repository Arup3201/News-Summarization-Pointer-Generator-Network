A Pakistani teenager has died from her injuries after she set herself on fire outside a police station when police released her alleged rapist.

Aamna Bibi, 18, set herself alight outside the police station in Muzaffargarh district in Punjab province after her attacker managed to bribe himself free, local media reports.

She was taken to hospital with 80 per cent burns to her body, but died the following day as a result of her injuries.

Ms Bibi died Friday after setting herself on fire Thursday in the village of Beit Mir Hazar Khan, Police Chief Usman Akran Gondal of Muzaffargarh district said.

PC Gondal says the woman's brother filed a complaint with police in January, saying his sister had been abducted and the assailants tried to rape her.

He said authorities investigated the claim but found no evidence to support it so they let the men go.

However, local media reports that one of the alleged attackers were set free after he handed the police a large bribe.

The accused was declared innocent by investigating officer Zulfiqar Ahmed after handing over 70,000 rupees (£690), the International Business Times reports.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said the woman had gone to the police station to protest, but decided to end her life in despair.

None of the police officers at the station tried to stop the self-immolation, local media said.

Rape cases are rarely prosecuted in Pakistan. Women who complain are often stigmatized.
