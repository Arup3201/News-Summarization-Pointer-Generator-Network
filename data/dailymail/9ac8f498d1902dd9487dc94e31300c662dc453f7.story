New token could be a diamond ring, guitar, toy robot, cat or helicopter

In a world of change, nothing stands still – not even a metallic Monopoly piece.

But in a shock to fans of the traditional family board game, one of them – either the Scottie dog, racecar, top hat, iron, shoe, thimble, battleship or wheelbarrow – is to be axed.

Maker Hasbro has decreed that the time has come to introduce a new piece. Contenders include a diamond ring, helicopter, cat, robot and a guitar..

Change: A new token will be introduced to the Monopoly game which could be a cat or a guitar

Charm: One of the board game's classic pieces will be replaced with a more up-to-date token 

Family favourite: A helicopter could replace one of the more classic pieces in Monopoly created in 1935

If it is any consolation to traditionalists, the issue is to be decided democratically.

Fans are being asked to cast their votes at Facebook.com/Monopoly by February 5.

Within hours of polling beginning yesterday the website was full of 
heated debate.

One enthusiast said: ‘Players have their favourites and 
each token means something to someone. Change for change sake is not 
needed, it will not change the game or  make it any more fun than it 
already is.’

Another said: ‘Don’t like this idea. Have played Monopoly 
using the dog for nearly 20yrs wouldn’t be the same without it!!’

A Hasbro spokesman said: ‘When we decided to replace one of the tokens, 
we knew we had to involve our fans in the process.’ 

Last night 
bookmaker Paddy Power made the wheelbarrow the 4/5 favourite to be axed,
 followed by the shoe at 2/1. A cat was the favourite to be the new 
token, at 13/8.

When the vote ends, Hasbro will replace the piece with a new token players would like added to the game which reflects the interests of Monopoly players today.

Familiar: Fans can vote for which classic Monopoly token they want to save including the Scottie dog

Eric Nyman, senior vice president and global brand leader for Hasbro Gaming, said: 'The tokens are one of the most iconic parts of the Monopoly game and we know that people are emotionally tied to their favorite one.'

'When we decided to replace one of the tokens in the game, we knew we had to involve our fans in the process.

'We can’t wait to see which iconic piece will ‘go to jail’ and which new token the fans will choose to become part of one of the world’s most popular games.'

Vote now: Posters are being circulated encouraging players to vote for their favourite Monopoly pieces

The game of Monopoly was invented by Charles Darrow, whose young nieces suggested he use metal charms from charm bracelets as movers in the game.  

Parker Brothers liked the idea and decided to include die-cast tokens when they started manufacturing and selling the Monopoly game in 1935.

The iron, race car, thimble, shoe, top hat and battleship were among the original set of movers introduced in 1935. 

The Scottie dog and wheelbarrow were added in the early 1950s.

These eight make up the collection of tokens currently included in the classic Monopoly game.

Later this year, the classic token with the fewest votes will be removed from the game and replaced with the new token that receives the most votes. 

Monopoly games with the new token will arrive on store shelves in mid to late 2013 so fans who would still like to play with the classic eight tokens have a limited time to pick up the existing version of the game. 

Hasbro plans to make a special 
Classic Monopoly Golden Token Edition that will include gold coloured 
versions of all eight classic tokens and the five new tokens included in
 the vote. 

Fans
 can also campaign to save their favourite token on Facebook and Twitter
 by using the hashtag #tokenvote before the vote ends on February 5.
