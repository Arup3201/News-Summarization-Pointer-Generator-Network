Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin isn't to blame for the GOP's loss in the 2008 presidential election, Meghan McCain, daughter of 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, says.

McCain told talk show host Larry King in an interview for his PoltiKING show that not even the Son of God could have saved her dad's campaign.

'I think my father could have had Jesus Christ as his running mate and it wouldn't have mattered in '07. I truly believe that,' she said.

'I think my father could have had Jesus Christ as his running mate and it wouldn't have mattered in '07. I truly believe that,' Meghan McCain now says of her dad's failed bid for the presidency five and a half years ago

McCain wrote in her 2010 book Dirty Sexy Politics that Palin added 'drama, stress, complications, panic and loads of uncertainty' to her father's presidential campaign' and that after it was all said and done ' she wondered 'if it was Sarah Palin's fault' that her dad, Arizona Senator John McCain, lost the general election to now-President Barack Obama.

In an interview about her book in August of 2010, McCain argued that 'I do clearly state at the end that we did not lose because of her, and 
I'm speaking out now because I do have conflicting feelings about her.'

'She brought so much momentum
 and enthusiasm to the campaign,' McCain told Good Morning America host George Stephanopolous.

Now, five and a half years later, McCain seems to have gained perspective on her dad's failed bid for the presidency.

Not only does she now claim Palin is not at fault for her father's defeat, she claims Palin was treated unfairly by the media.

'I wish the media had been easier on her during that time, or at least more understanding,' McCain told King in an interview that will air later tonight.

McCain agreed with King that Palin did 'bring a lot on herself' but said 'she was also not given a great hand and people really wanted to rip her apart.'

'Again you just be a strong woman in the media - it doesn't matter what party - and the media's going to annihilate you,' the 29-year-old said.

McCain's distaste for Republican strategist Karl Rove, on the other hand, still knows no bounds nor does her hatred for the Secret Service.

As the daughter of a presidential nominee, McCain had Secret Service protection for a few months in 2008. McCain said her time with the agents left a bad taste in her mouth, and she wasn't surprised when they started getting into trouble with prostitutes.

'I respect that they're there to protect people, but I found them very cliquey and very gossipy and very voyeuristic. I did not like the secret service,' she said.

McCain's beef with Rove goes back more than a decade to the 2000 presidential election, during which her father was also a candidate.

Her family still believes Rove spread a rumor during that election that her adopted sister from Bangladesh was an illegitimate child of her father.

'I hate Karl Rove and I think he still needs to apologize to my family, which he has not done, for the things that happened in 2000,' McCain told King, 'and I think there was an era where Karl Rove was relevant and I don’t know why people still give him attention.'

She pointed to Election Day 2012 as evidence that people should stop taking the former Bush adviser seriously. On that day, Rove refused to believe that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had lost the election, long after it had become clear that Barack Obama had won.

McCain said she also thinks his comment's on Hillary Clinton's health are in poor taste.

Of course Clinton's health should be an issue of discussion should she run in 2016, McCain said, calling it 'a very interesting conversation to have.

But she said the way Rove went about it was 'disgusting.'
