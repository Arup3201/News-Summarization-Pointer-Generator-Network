A photographer has embarked on a journey to capture the remaining rest stops on the roadsides of America before they vanish from existence.

Ryann Ford, 32, from Austin, Texas, United States, has spent the last five years driving across America to capture 'humble' rest stops.

Her journey has seen photograph over 150 rest stops, while driving over 20,000 miles across 17 states.

Each of the rest-stops display a very inque style of architecture; here is a stop near Sonora, Texas

'My inspiration was the structures themselves,' said Miss Ford.

'I am a big fan of mid-century architecture and can usually spot it when I see it. When I moved to Texas, eight years ago, and started noticing these old stops set out on gorgeous minimalist landscapes, I was instantly inspired.

'There are tables shaded by faux oil rigs, teepees and wagon wheels, and geometric shapes echoing classic mid-century design. They are a really great example of Americana.'

The results of her documentation show that rest stops vary in design and usually take influences from the state, town or city.

This stop near Austin, Nevada looks like it could become more like a sauna should the sun reach full strength

This resting place in Abiquiu, New Mexico is dwarfed by snow-covered mountains in the background

Miss Ford said: 'think people will learn how historically significant these unassuming stops are and I don't think a lot of people realize how unique the design of each stop is until you look at dozens of them at a time. I think most people will also find beauty in something they never expected to when they slow down and take a good look.

'When I started the project I did a little research and was alarmed to read that they were currently being closed and demolished all over the country. I immediately felt an urgency to document as many as I could, as quickly as I could. It was also really interesting to find out how much thought went into these stops.

'When Eisenhower designed the Interstate Highway System in 1956, it standardized highway design from coast to coast. The one element that stayed within the jurisdiction of the states, however, was their rest stop design. States really took advantage of that and used the best architects and designers, and their creativity, to design stops that represented the different regions of their state and their cultural and historical significance.'

This stop near Walker Lake, Nevada is of the more simple style, and would just about fit a family of four under cover

It may not have walls, but this stop at Thackerville, Oklahoma does at least have a roof to protect from any rain or snow

This stop at the Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona might not be the prettiest, but it looks of sturdy nature

Miss Ford is now aiming to create a book of all the rest stops, called 'The Last Stop - A Photo Book of America's Rest Stops' by December next year with her project still ongoing.

All of the locations will be captioned, along with their GPS coordinates, with plans for a historian to write an essay for the book.

Miss Ford, who is sometimes accompanied by her mother on her trips, will continue to document more rest stops into the New Year.

She added: 'When I tell people I am working on a project documenting rest stops, a lot of them look at me funny as they are probably picturing dirty toilets and truck drivers.

The shade at this stop in Monument Valley, Arizona is just what is needed on the desert landscape that can reach sweltering point

Ryann Ford's journey has seen photograph over 150 rest stops, including this one near Organ, New Mexico, while driving over 20,000 miles across 17 states

You'd better hope there's not too many weary travellers at this stop near Saguaro National Park, Arizona, with space at a premium

Resembling an old-style jail cell, this stop at Juan Santa Cruz Picnic Area,Tucson, Arizona retains a certain style

'Once I show them a few of the photos though, they get it immediately and love the project. People love to point out which ones they've been to and share their stories and memories of visiting these stops.

'My mom joined me on almost all of the trips. We are great travel buddies and the trips with her were so much fun. She would just sit in a chair and read while I shot the rest stops.'
