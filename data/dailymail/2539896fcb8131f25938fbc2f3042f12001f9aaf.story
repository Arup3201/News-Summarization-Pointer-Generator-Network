With its grey shingle beach, often deserted seafront promenades and rows upon rows of terraced houses, Portsmouth is hardly known as Britain's most picturesque city.

But one diminutive tourist managed to capture the true beauty of the UK's only island city from a different perspective.

At just a few centimetres high the tiny Lego tourist can be seen photographing Southsea beach, trainspotting and even slipping on a banana skin.

Little tourist: Andrew Whyte has been photographing a Lego man at a variety of locations in Portsmouth, Hampshire, since August last year

The unique set of pictures was taken by local photographer Andrew Whyte who began taking shots of the Lego man in August last year when he wanted to add a common theme to the snaps he was taking.

Since then he has captured the figure in a range of weather conditions and at various locations around the historic city, famed for its Navy base and as being the birthplace of Charles Dickens.

Andrew, 38, said: 'The project isn't about the Lego, it's about the character.

'I used to walk around all the time taking photographs of random things like sunsets, textures, locations, but they had no connection.

'To capture those moments is great, but they had no theme. By following the lego figure day to day it makes the photographs easier to follow.

Connection: Andrew Whyte started taking pictures of the Lego man, seen here on the city's shingle beach at sunset, because he wanted a common theme running through his photography

Photo diary: Since the turn of the year, Andrew has taken 150 images as he seeks to complete a year long project charting 2013 through from the perspective of his little Lego subject

'The banana skin photo was an obvious one. People always say about it but I'd never seen it so I decided to make it happen.

'It's making everyday things fun.'

Since the turn of the year, Andrew has taken 150 images as he seeks to complete a year long project charting 2013 through from the perspective of his little Lego subject.

Far from employing the latest in photographic technology, Andrew takes all of the images using his mobile phone.

Slippery: Andrew says that his choice of photographing the Lego man slipping on a banana skin was an 'obvious' one

Trainspotting: The Lego figure is captured climbing up a rusty fence to get a better view of a passing train

Andrew added: 'I enjoy the challenge of doing it all on my phone.

'Sometimes the weather can be really difficult. If there's the slightest wind I feel just as frustrated as the little guy would if he could feel falling over.

'I call him either "the little guy" or "the legographer". I think giving him a real name would be going a step too far.

Shellshocked: Andrew pictured his tiny subject looking at the word 'Boo' spelt out on the beach using pebbles

All aboard: Andrew takes the figure everywhere in his pocket in case he comes across an ideal photo opportunity

'So far I've had really positive feedback. I don't think it's something you can look at negatively.

'People say they can relate to his mood in the photographs, they warm to them.

'It's a surprise to me that it's been so popular. I think it helps people look back on their childhood.'

Andrew now carries his lego companion in his pocket everywhere he goes.

Almost all of the images are shot in and around Portsmouth.
