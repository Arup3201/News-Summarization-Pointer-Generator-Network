Forget flash cars, expensive restaurants and lavish bouquets - the way to impress the nation’s women is to fasten on a tool belt and get drilling.

High maintenance females have voted DIY skills sexier in a man than sporting prowess and cooking capabilities.  

A new study has revealed women’s top turn ons - and turn offs - when it comes to a man's skill set, taking in everything from assembling furniture and unblocking drains to scoring on the football pitch or cooking up a storm in the kitchen.

Handy man: 74 per cent of women revealed that a sexy trait in a man is an ability to DIY - including putting up shelves

In at number one, 74 per cent of women revealed that a sexy trait in a man is an ability to DIY - including putting up shelves, basic building, putting up blinds and laying decking in the garden.

A staggering 61 per cent claimed they would actually be put off a potential partner if he wasn’t practical around the house.

Furthermore, despite there being a big increase in recent years of the number of women willing to try their hands at DIY, a massive 68 per cent believe that it is a man’s job and they would find it unattractive if they were better at it than their partner.

The second sexiest skill to have is sporting prowess, with 69 per cent of women finding sporting ability a key factor when looking for the ideal man. 

Sexy skills: While DIY was voted the sexiest skill, athletic abilities and culinary skills (as demonstrated by David Beckham and Jamie Oliver) were also voted in the top five

Any budding Jamie Olivers out there will be pleased to know that capacity to cook comes third on the list of attractive qualities.

Proficient driving and managing finances complete the set.

Jon Gough from Spaceslide.co.uk, who commissioned the research, said: 'When men's skill sets came under scrutiny, it seems men who are willing to get their hands dirty are those deemed the most attractive.

'It's interesting that women also judge a man’s ability to score on the football field alongside his ability to score in the bedroom.'

Money makers and top gear: Women also like men who can handle their finances like entrepreneur Alan Sugar and men who are good behind the wheel like Jeremy Clarkson
