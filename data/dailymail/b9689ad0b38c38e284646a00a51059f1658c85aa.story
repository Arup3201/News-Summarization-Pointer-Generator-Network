Tragic: Trudy Glenister lost four litres of blood on her way to Southend Hospital and died shortly after arriving

A pregnant woman bled to death after junior paramedics waited 40 minutes to take her to hospital, it has emerged.

Trudy Glenister, 38, warned family she thought she was 'losing the baby' after she started vomiting and suffering from severe abdominal pains in April 2011.

But trainee ambulance staff refused to leave for Southend Hospital for almost an hour - and would not use the emergency sirens, an inquest has heard.

Instead they opted to 'observe' Mrs Glenister for 40 minutes before deciding to take her to hospital.

Paramedics also initially dismissed the possibility of her suffering an ectopic pregnancy - where the foetus grows in the fallopian tube rather than the womb - and failed to realise there was an internal bleed.

Mrs Glenister, who was five weeks pregnant with her second child, went into cardiac arrest after suffering internal bleeding caused by the ectopic pregnancy. She died moments after arriving at hospital.

In a damning narrative verdict, Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray slammed the East of England Ambulance Service for the 'disturbing' failings.

Failings listed included student paramedics failed to fully to appreciate an acute emergency and did not alert the hospital.

She
 blasted the 'unacceptable delay' transferring Mrs Glenister, who lost four litres of blood in the time it took to reach the hospital. She added that the blue lights and sirens should have been used on the way.

Mrs Beasley-Murray told Chelmsford Coroner's Court: 'There were serious failings in the care provided to Mrs Glenister by the the East of England Ambulance Service.

'Much in this case has been troubling.

'Firstly, the apparent lack of training on the subject of ectopic pregancy.

'The court was referred to two paragraphs in training manuals - that clearly had not been sufficient training.

'The court is also troubled by the use of student paramedics on emergency calls like this one.

'This has been a most sad case.

'The evidence has been most disturbing and harrowing to hear.'

The 999 lottery: It emerged half the East of England Ambulance Service was staffed by trainees that night

Grieving sister Paula Chapman has slammed the 'lottery of dialling 999', telling the court the condition was 'preventable'.

Speaking after an inquest at Chelmsford 
Coroners’ Court today her sister Mrs Chapman, 37, said: 'People need to 
know the lottery of dialling 999.

An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, in a fallopian tube.

In this state, the egg will not develop into a baby and could have devastating consequences for the mother's health.

With few noticeable symptoms, it is common for the condition to go unnoticed until detected by a routine test.

If it is not detected, the mother will likely suffer from heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, and dizziness at any point between five and 14 weeks of pregnancy.

If the egg grows and ruptures the fallopian tube, she will experience sudden and severe pain, feeling faint or dizzy, vomiting, diarrhoea, and shoulder pain.

This is a medical emergency.

It is a signal that the mother is suffering life-threatening internal bleeding.

'Half the ambulances won’t have a trained paramedic on them.

'If the ambulance service think this is acceptable then they need to tell people.

'My sister had a serious but preventable condition - she just needed urgent surgery.

'We’re heartbroken but pleased the coroner found significant failings at the ambulance trust.'

Shocking evidence from ambulance bosses revealed half the ambulances on call on the night of Mrs Glenister’s death were crewed entirely by trainee paramedics.

Ambulance trainee Mark Nelmes told the court he and a student colleague had arrived at the home in Great Wakering, Essex, at 7.29pm on April 11, 2011, and began making observations at 7.35pm.

Observations continued until 8.09pm before they drove to the hospital without emergency lights and sirens, claiming he feared using them might 'increase the patient’s anxiety'.

Following the 15-minute journey, the crew queued up behind other ambulances, unaware of the medical emergency at hand.

Mrs
 Glenister, who worked as a bank manager, was declared dead shortly 
after arrival at Southend Hospital at 9.58pm the same evening.

Mr Nelmes admitted that he had only been 
training for a year and his knowledge of ectopic pregnancies was 
restricted to two brief paragraphs in training manuals.

The paramedics failed to alert Southend Hospital of the emergency and waited in a 'not urgent' queue

He conceded that he did not have the same level of knowledge as a paramedic but claimed he had followed his training by carrying out two sets of observations before taking the patient to hospital.

A post-mortem revealed Mrs Glenister had lost four litres of blood in her abdominal area after suffering a rupture of the fallopian tubes in what pathologist Dr Ian Caulder described as an 'acute medical surgical emergency'.

A number of Mrs Glenister’s family, including widower Nigel Glenister, attended the second and concluding day of the inquest today.
