The president of a Chicago transit union says there are indications the operator of a commuter train that derailed at O'Hare International Airport dozed off.

Amalgamated Transit Union Local 308 President Robert Kelly says the operator told him she had worked a lot of overtime recently and was 'extremely tired.'

'The indication [that she dozed off] is there, yes,' Kelly said during a news conference Monday. 'She has worked a lot of hours in the past weekend, and the indication is there.'

About four dozen people were injured in the accident. None of the injuries were serious

About 3 a.m. Monday, a Chicago Transit Authority train jumped the tracks at the O'Hare stop, skidded across a platform and scaled an escalator leading to the airport. More than 30 people were injured.

There were no life-threatening injuries.

The
 driver of the train, who is yet to be identified, has worked for the 
CTA for about a year, Kelly said, and has worked a lot of overtime 
recently. However, she had 17 hours off between her last shift and her 
shift Monday morning.

'So
 she had an ample amount of time to be off that day,' Kelly told the 
Chicago Tribune. 'I do know she works a lot, as a lot of our members 
do.'

After the crash, the unidentified driver immediately got off the train began checking on passengers.

The
 driver was treated for an injury to her leg and released from a local 
hospital. She will be interviewed by National Transportation Safety 
Board agents on Tuesday.

According to Kelly, the driver didn't appear to be speeding at the time of the derailment.

'All the reports that weâ€™ve received from the towermen and the 
supervisor on duty indicate that she was not coming in at a fast speed 
at all, she was coming in like every other train, normal,' Kelly said.

NTSB
 agents will analyze her work schedule and activities in the week 
leading up to the crash. They will also check her medical history as 
part of the investigation.

According to the Tribune, the driver already has undergone routine drug and alcohol testing.

The crash happened when a westbound train stopped at the CTA Blue Line Harlem station, and was struck by an eastbound train on the same track

Several ambulances were sent to the scene of the crash, where as many as four dozen people were injured

Martinez Butler, a train engineer for another company, said he witnessed the collision.

'There was a train that was stopped at the station. Another train came through and looked like it blew the signal, because I heard beeping,' she told NBC Chicago.

'I'm a locomotive engineer,' she added. 'I know the systems, I know the sounds. When you hear those beepings it's warning you that there is an obstruction in front of you and you need to stop.'
