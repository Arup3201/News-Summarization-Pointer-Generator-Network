Prince Harry’s presence is enough to turn the First Lady into something resembling a giggling teenager.

So when Britain’s most eligible bachelor kissed gold, silver and bronze medal winners at the Warrior Games this weekend, you can hardly blame them for their beaming smiles.

The 28-year-old royal charmed crowds when he arrived in Washington last week, creating scenes of hysteria worthy of a pop star.

And on Sunday he continued to woo young Americans, congratulating Lacey Hamilton, who won gold in a cycling race at Colorado Springs, with a kiss.

The prince proceeded to kiss the U.S. Army’s Margaux Mange after presenting her with a silver medal for the Women’s Bicycle Open.

And if that wasn’t enough, bronze medal-winning Ashley Crandall also received a peck on the cheek.

Lacey Hamilton, who is originally from New Castle, Delaware, is an Army Captain who sustained injuries to her hand, vertebrae and a traumatic brain injury during deployment to Afghanistan in December 2010. 

She is currently studying at Colorado Technical University and credits her husband Larry for her recovery.

Prior to the games and winning gold, she said: 'I have learned that I am a much stronger-willed person than I ever imagined... I was determined to not let my injury get in the way of living life.'

Silver medal winner Margaux Mange, 27, is a retired sergeant who won six medals in sitting volleyball, cycling and track at previous Warrior Games.

She was injured in the line of duty in Iraq, suffering PTS and neuralgia in December 2006.

The 27-year-old, from Lakewood, Colorado, says that getting involved in sports helped her out of a 'dark place, mentally and physically'.

Ms Mange is set to take part in the Walking With The Wounded expedition to the South Pole, which Prince Harry announced last month as patron of the charity.

Ashley Crandall, who took the bronze medal, said that sports have been a large part of her recovery from her injuries.

She had three deployments over six years with the U.S. Army, including serving in Iraq as a Blackhawk helicopter mechanic.

In 2009, the sergeant was diagnosed with PTSD and Mal Debarquement Syndrome. Crandall, from Salt Lake City, Utah, also said that her family and friends have been instrumental in her recovery.

Harry has continued to win hearts on his seven-day tour along America’s east coast.

During a visit to the White House last
Thursday he received glowing praise from Michelle Obama for serving his
country in the British Army and for supporting America’s wounded 
soldiers.

He spent the 
weekend promoting the Warrior Games in which British servicemen and 
women have been competing in Paralympic-style events against a large U.S. 
team and troops from other countries.

Last
time Harry was in America, he was photographed naked in Las Vegas as he 
played strip billiards with a group of women in his $8,000-a-night 
suite.

Harry will take part in a high-profile bid to promote British business and tourism alongside British prime minister David Cameron in New York on Tuesday.

The
two men will take a ride through Manhattan on a new London Routemaster 
bus to kick off a two-year promotional campaign around the world.
