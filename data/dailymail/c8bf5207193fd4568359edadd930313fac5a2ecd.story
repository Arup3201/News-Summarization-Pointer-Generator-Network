Baby Gammy could leave hospital within days after doctors confirmed he did not have a congenital heart condition despite fears he was on death's door.

The six month old boy at the centre of the international surrogacy scandal was admitted to hospital south of Bangkok late last week with a suspected heart defect and trouble breathing after his surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua rushed him to hospital.

Baby Gammy, who has Down syndrome, does not have a heart condition, Thai doctors have confirmed

He was treated for pneumonia and a cardiologist examined his heart but on Wednesday gave the little boy a clean bill of health.

'At first he was brought to us because he was coughing,' a spokeswoman for the Samitivej Sriracha Hospital told Daily Mail Australia

'The mother was worried he was going to have heart disease. We examined and he does not, his heart is strong and normal.'

The spokeswoman also told the Bangkok Post: 'He has pneumonia which is quite a normal ailment for children of this age,' said Mr Wijit.

'We had a cardiology expert run a check on his heart and we are happy to say he has no heart disease to worry about.'

A statement released on Tuesday on behalf of Australian couple Wendy and David Farnell said they were told Gammy, who was born with Down syndrome, was so ill he was not expected to live.

They then left Thailand with Gammy's twin sister, fearing political turmoil in the country would prevent them from leaving at all.

'Gammy was very sick when he was born and the biological parents were told he would not survive and he had a day, at best, to live and to say goodbye,' it said.

His supposed condition also prompted an outpouring of generosity from around the world, with more than $120,000 raised for his health care.
