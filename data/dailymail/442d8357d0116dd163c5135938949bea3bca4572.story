Eliaquim Mangala's £32million transfer fee to Manchester City squeezes him between Barcelona's Dani Alves, at £31m, and former Juventus full-back Lilliam Thuram, who moved there for £36.5m, in the most expensive ever defenders list.

On current form for his new club, he would be more suitably positioned between a pair of unknown Sunday League defenders.

'Where did they sign him from?' one spectator at the Boleyn Ground asked. It was pointed out he came from Porto. 'I hope they kept the receipt.'

Elaquim Mangala was poor against West Ham on Saturday and has not impressed in his seven games for City

What City manager Manuel saw in the player when he signed him in the summer is a mystery, at the moment.

9 min - Almost scuffs a clearance over Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart

18 min - Easily beaten to a long-ball by West Ham striker Diafra Sakho, which lead to a chance for the home side

19 min - Sakho steals the ball from the City defender near his own box on the right

41 min - Leaves Enner Valencia unmarked in the City, but misses to the left

42 min - Fails to clear the ball and loses posession to Sakho yet again

He was a constant liability at the back for City against West Ham.

This is not the first nightmare afternoon he has had, in only seven games.

Against Hull, last month, he conceded a penalty and scored an own goal. Fortunately on that day his team-mates managed to score four so he got away with it. That was not the case this time.

From as early as the ninth minute it started going wrong, when he was facing his own goal and thrashed a leg at the ball sending the clearance looping over Joe Hart and heading in, only for the goalkeeper to push it over.

Ten minutes later and Hart saved him again. Diafra Sakho all too easily beat Mangala to a long-range free kick sent into the box and his cushion header played in Enner Valencia, who was only denied by Hart from point-blank range.

The same happened again in the second half – another ball booted high and long which the centre-back took time to position himself under and jump for the header, only for Sakho to beat him again. Nothing came from it on this occasion.

On 19 minutes he was at fault again. This time Mangala had his pocket picked by Sakho near his own box on the right.

Vincent Kompany eventually rushed back to clear, while tumbling, when the ball was crossed into the box. He must've been wondering how much more covering he had to do.

Against Hull, Mangala conceded a penalty and scored an own goal in City's 4-2 victory at the KC stadium

The defender was in the French international squad for this summer's World Cup in Brazil but didn't feature

Just before half-time, he knew for sure. A low ball was played into the box and Valencia, completely free, took a touch before shooting narrowly passed the left post.

Kompany pointed at the space and looked over at his defensive partner, questioning why so much was allowed.

And it was heart-in-mouth stuff a minute later when he failed to clear the ball and Sakho got possession of it instead. In his defence, he hustled the player across the pitch to win the ball back.

There was a moment of promise, midway through the second half, when he dived back, at full stretch, to intercept a rapid West Ham break to stop what would have been a certain goal.

That is by no means £32m defending, though.
