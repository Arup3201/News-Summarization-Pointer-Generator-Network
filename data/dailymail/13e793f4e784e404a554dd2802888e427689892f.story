The 24-year-old manager was driven to the hospital by a friend, but it was not Durk Banks who brought him, Chicago Homicide Watch reported. 

Hours before the shooting Agina, Banks, 22, and DJ Bandz went to Noah's  condominium to discuss the 30-year-old athlete's 'Rock Your Drop' anti-violence campaign.

DJ Bandz's manager Devin Jackson said: 'Chino was a good dude.

'He took care of the business. That is what he was known for. 

'I definitely didn't think what happened to him would happen to him.'

Nobody has been charged for Agina’s killing and the investigation is ongoing.  

Banks and Agina pleaded guilty to gun crimes in the past.

Agina pleaded guilty in November 2010 to a misdemeanor gun charge and Banks pleaded guilty to gun charges last year, according to court records.

The rapper was sentenced to probation for 18 months and 50 hours community service following an arrest after he was spotted with a handgun in June 2013 on the city's South Side.
