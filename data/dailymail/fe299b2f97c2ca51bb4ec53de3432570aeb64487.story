This is the shocking moment two men brazenly stole two cocker spaniels from outside their owner's home.

A campaign to find the dogs was started on Facebook after Tina Drayson captured thieves on CCTV as they piled her pets into a Renualt Clio and sped off from her home in Cranleigh, Surrey.

She shared the footage on Facebook, which has been seen by almost 3.5million people, and four hours after the suspects dumped the dogs 11 miles away, she was reunited with Nelson and Brock.

Two thieves were captured in shocking CCTV footage, which shows them brazenly stealing the two dogs

They were spotted by two 16-year-old boys who had been walking home from a party at about midnight on Friday when they were followed by two black and brown puppies.

Jamal Betts and Matt Kipping had been discussing the video earlier that night with friends and it dawned on them that the two animals were the ones from the video.

Mr Betts quickly called his mother and then the RSPCA and they waited with the dogs until the police arrived.

His mother, Tara Betts, said: 'Nelson was very anxious but was coaxed into my car with Brock who was quick to jump in because he knew he was going home.

'The police took one look at the dogs and said "yep, that's them" and informed the boys that the dogs they had rescued were in fact the stolen working dogs from Cranleigh.' 

The two men drove up to Tina Drayson's house in Cranleigh, Surrey, on Friday afternoon, unaware they were being filmed

One of the men got out of the car as the driver waited for him to grab their 'loot' and speed off within minutes

Pet owner Mrs Drayson shared the footage on Facebook at 8pm, which has been seen by 3.5million people

Their owner, Mrs Drayson, 44, has since thanked those who had watched and shared the video.

She said: 'The power of Facebook - due to everyone's efforts we made our dogs too hot to handle and they were found wandering in Burpham in Guildford at midnight.

'We have been reunited with Nelson and Brock, thank you all once again,' she wrote in a Facebook post.

The theft of gun dogs has risen dramatically in the last two years since stolen metal laws were hardened, according to a Lost Dog spokeswoman.

She said: 'As people found it more difficult to sell stolen metal they moved into stealing gun dogs.'

Within four hours of posting the video the family were reunited with Brock and Nelson after two teenagers, who had seen the video, were returning from a party and realised they were being followed by the dogs
