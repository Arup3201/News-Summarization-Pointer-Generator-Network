A daughter arrested for murdering her mother claims to have no memory of what happened minutes before finding the body.

Detectives were alerted to the crime after a passer-by found the body of Penelope Cunningham, 60, in a remote area of Colorado, several miles from Gypsum.

The body was partially covered in frost and several empty bullet casings lay nearby.

The officers matched the casings to ammunition found in the Cunningham home, but the case for the corresponding pistol was empty, according to The Denver Channel.

Penelope’s 28-year-old daughter, Traci, was tracked down and arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder after officers homed in on her mobile phone signal.

She told detectives that she was responsible for the shooting, according to the arrest affidavit.

She explained during questioning that she and her mother had been driving to a hiking spot when an argument broke out about chores and the way she cares for animals.

Penelope then got out of the car and began walking, the affidavit states.

Traci also climbed out but went to the back of the car to look for some food. At this point, Traci told detectives, she found a handgun, picked it up and walked up the road.

Traci Cunningham told police that before discovering the body of her mother, they had been driving to a hiking spot in Colorado

Then ‘everything goes blank’, the document says she told officers.

She explains that she later found her mother’s body and the handgun in her hand. After realising she had no phone signal, she said she decided to drive home and pretend ‘it was all a bad dream’.

A neighbour told 9News that Penelope was a  'very sweet, very loving, very nice person'.

Traci was treated in the past for mental illness, a local told The Denver Channel.

Penelope is a former nun and was a teacher at Maxwell Elementary School in Montbello. Traci was her adopted daughter, according to reports.
