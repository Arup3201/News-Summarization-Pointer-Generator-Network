A motorbike hurtles towards me, a man carrying a goat perched pillion.

I leap out of the way just in time and hear the warning cry - ‘Balak! Balak!’ - as two young men on bicycles heading in the opposite direction swerve around me and disappear into the throng.

On my right, silk, silver and spice sellers jostle with leather-workers and wood carvers; on my left people queue to buy boiled sheep’s brains. 

Musky aromas emanate from herboristas to compete with the smell of citrus, mint, cedarwood - and the odd whiff of drains.

Just desert: The Sahara Desert tour was an evening excursion which involved riding dromedaries (resting in the distance) into the 450 foot high Erg Chebbi dunes to watch the sun go down. Thunderstorm optional

The word 'bustling' could have been invented to describe the souks of Morocco.

And nowhere does it seem more appropriate than here in the medina of Fes, where human life exists in all shades, from poverty to splendour. 

The winding passages - full of shops, locals, tourists, saucepans, mirrors, wedding dresses, children selling packs of tissues, and the odd lost kitten - seem even more vibrant than in the fabled market of Marrakech, which I passed through two days earlier.

Is it really only 48 hours since I landed in north Africa? It feels a lifetime ago.

Archers has been offering mainstream and specialist holidays to destinations across the planet for 50 years. Its 10-night ’Highlights of Morocco’ package is a firm favourite - and the itinerary is exhaustive.

Our tour director Ann - a resident of the country for 35 years, having arrived as young rep – is a font of information, and has links with local businesses and guides all over the country.

The group I am travelling with could not be described as young. Pensioners with a yearning for adventure dominate this inquisitive army of 36 adventure-seekers - from the UK, Canada, Australia and the US. My travelling companion and I are soon rather sweetly dubbed ‘the girls’.

Alliances and unlikely friendships are formed, and we swap contact details with people we would never have expected to meet before the trip. 

The medina in Fes (left) was a real eye-opener, teeming with life - in contrast to the tranquillity found in former palace gardens like this one in Meknes (right), which was made even more colourful by the local guide

It does not take long to see why former King Hassan II described his country as having ‘one foot in Africa, the other in Europe’. 

Morocco is a vast and varied territory that was only united into a modern nation state in 1956. The rise and fall of powerful dynasties and mighty empires - a recurring pattern in its colourful history - has resulted in a melting pot of tribes, and a multi-faith society.

While Arabic and French is spoken by the majority, a large number of people are descended from the ancient Berbers (or Amaziah), who have preserved their own languages and customs.

Our tour is a 1,000-mile (1,700 km) round trip which takes in the labyrinthine walled cities of Marrakech, Casablanca, Rabat and Fes. Roman ruins, ornate mosques, kasbahs and palaces with beautiful tiled courtyards are all part of our progress. Snow-capped mountains, vast barren plains and deep gorges feature heavily as we continue our journey.

Although I am unconvinced about the prospect of lengthy stints on a coach, I soon find that this is a good way of getting under the skin of a country - each day offering a totally different experience.

From the urban sprawl of Casablanca we travel to the historic city of Meknes - where, during a tour of the former royal stables and granaries, our local guide paints a colourful picture of the bloodthirsty 17th century megalomaniac Sultan Moulay Ismail, who was rumoured to have sired 1,000 children. 

Catherine and Jane chill out in a shepherd family's tent in the desert (left), but say no to the mint tea... Right, camels woven from palm trees are sold at the side of the road by young boys to boost the family income

Then we journey through vast red plains, past the occasional solitary goatherd or flock of camels, to the ancient city of Fes.

After a couple of days there – the chaotic medina being an obvious highlight - we travel south, through the curiously Swiss-like chalet town of Ifrane, where the privileged go to ski.

Then we wind through the Atlas Mountains and the spectacular Ziz Valley - a slash of green in the barren landscape, with more than a million trees.

We end up in Erfoud, an oasis town on the edge of the mighty Sahara Desert.

King Mohammed VI, who began his rule in 1999 when his father Hassan II died, has brought a (relative) wave of democracy and modernity to the country.

A massive road building programme (with solar-powered street lights in places) has been implemented to improve the movement of Morocco’s rural population - while the inevitable increase in tourism is mirrored by a growing number of golf courses and shopping malls.

Thankfully (for us anyway) there are still few modern features in the south, and an extraordinary experience in the Sahara Desert tour proves to be my favourite moment of the entire tour.

From our haven of a hotel in Erfoud, a fleet of four-by-fours whizzes us into the desert.

An hour later, we are removing our shoes outside a Berber shepherd’s tent, although (pre-warned by Ann that the ‘furry bag’ the water is stored in is in fact a goat’s carcass) we politely turn down the offer of mint tea. 

The next leg of our trek into the 450ft-high Erg Chebbi dunes is on a different type of 4x4 entirely.

Atop my own personal dromedary I drink in the sight of the vast orange sands curving ahead of us, the line of majestic camels silhouetted against the sky.

There is no sound except the occasional grunt of a camel, or call from one of the men, and an expectant hush descends as we sit in a line along the sharp edge of a dune, to watch the sunset.

Suddenly, thunder rumbles and a flash of lighting cracks the sky. The sand turns red as the heavens open, and our camel drivers scurry to cover us in blankets.

A thunderstorm in the desert! I feel blessed to experience such an incredible sight.

Our tour ends where it began - in exotic Marrakech, with its extravagant architecture and busy squares and markets.  

Lights up: Snake charmers, musicians and acrobats appear every night in the main square in Marrakech

As dusk falls on the Djemaa el-Fna square, stallholders scramble to set up their mobile restaurants, the light provided by bare bulbs hooked up to gas cylinders.

We descend from the rooftop terrace where we have been watching the scene unfold, and sit at one of the food stalls - where we enjoy freshly fried calamari, salads and flatbreads with fiery dips, and aubergine cooked to perfection.

Families huddle in circles around flickering coloured lanterns, and men selling gaudy toys shout for custom - amid snake charmers, musicians, acrobats and storytellers. 

It is a magical scene. But I can't help drifting back to that sand dune, lightning flickering above me - an experience that touched my soul.
