A housemaid who killed her employer's baby girl to spite a colleague has been sentenced to death.

The maid, whose name has not been released, was handed the sentence at Abu Dhabi Criminal Court in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The Indonesian woman was found guilty after the court heard she picked up four-month-old baby Malak  from her cot, threw her to the floor and hit her head against a wall repeatedly before putting her back.

Murder: The Indonesian maid was convicted of murder in Abu Dhabi in the UAE

It was said she carried out the extraordinary attack on Malak - whose name means 'angel' - to get at a colleague, according to The National.

The child's nanny, a Filipino woman, was in the shower at the time and came back to the sight of the injured baby struggling to breathe.

She was rushed to the Sheikh Khalifa Hospital in the city, where doctors disagnosed her with a fractured skull and sever brain damage. She died on 28 April this year - two weeks after the attack.

In an attempt to frame her, the maid initially blamed Malak's nanny, for the death, but admitted her guilt when she was presented with video footage of her actions.

Prosecutors said that she resented her colleague because it was her job to care for Malak and her brother, while the convicted woman had to care for a sick grandmother.

Attack: The woman initially tried to blame a colleague for the attack, but admitted her guilt when confronted with video footage.

In a previous hearing the nanny said she did not realise how much the maid hated her.

Prosecutors said: 'The maid was caught on camera as she lifted the baby from her 
bed, threw her on the floor and hit her head against a wall repeatedly'.

They have been aggressive in their calls for the death penalty to be given, and rejected offers of blood money - which in the Emirati legal system can allow people to receive reduced sentences in return for a payment.

The maid’s defence lawyer Ali Al Abadi told the court in a previous hearing 
that his client was suffering from psychological problems that caused 
her to attack the child.

All death sentences in the UAE are subject to two rounds of appeals, but if these fails the maid will be killed by a firing squad.
