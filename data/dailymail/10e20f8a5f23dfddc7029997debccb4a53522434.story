A 26-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly stripping naked, falling through a ceiling into a women's bathroom and assaulting an 84-year-old man in a bizarre rampage at a Boston airport.

Cameron Shenk reportedly stripped inside one of the stalls in the bathroom at Logan International Airport on Saturday, before leaving his clothes on the floor and climbing into a dropped ceiling.

He then crashed through the ceiling, suffering cuts to his head and body, and attacked an elderly man while he was still naked and bleeding, leaving the pensioner with serious injuries, it is claimed.

'Once outside the restroom, for reasons still under investigation, Shenk assaulted and seriously injured an 84-year-old man,' Massachusetts State Police said in an online statement. 

'That victim was later transported to a local area hospital with various injuries that are not expected to be life threatening.'

Shenk, whose motive remains unknown, then allegedly struggled with troopers who arrested him, injuring one of them. The suspect was later taken to Massachusetts General Hospital.

He has since been charged with attempted murder, mayhem, assault and battery on a person aged over 60, assault and battery on a police officer and the execution of a lewd and lascivious act.

Shenk, from Boston - who has also been charged with malicious destruction to property costing more than $250 - will be booked upon release and arraigned in East Boston District Court, police said.  

A telephone listing for the suspect could not be located. The exact details of his supposed assault on the elderly man on Saturday morning remain unknown.

The alleged rampage  came on the same day that a 52-year-old male driver was arrested near the airport's Terminal B after allegedly assaulting a 21-year-old female passenger.

Anton Hilton, from Roxbury, was detained by police after a bystander heard the alleged victim screaming from inside the car, which was sporting a broken windshield. 

He has been charged with assault, battery and kidnapping, and will also be arraigned in East Boston District Court, according to Boston.com.

An investigation is ongoing in both cases.
