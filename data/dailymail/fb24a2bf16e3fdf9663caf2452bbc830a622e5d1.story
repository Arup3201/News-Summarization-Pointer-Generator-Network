The drug-addicted parents of a one-year-old girl who ingested heroin left within her reach have been jailed.

The baby was reported to be shaking and rolling her eyes after putting the substance in her mouth while left briefly unattended at her home, but her father Justin Robinson, 25, waited 45 minutes before finally taking the infant to her grandparents' house and asking them: 'Does she look okay?'.

The child, who by then was 'unresponsive and had blue lips and skin', was taken to a hospital in Reno, Nevada, U.S., on Saturday night, according to the Reno Gazette-Journal.

Justin Robinson, 25, and his partner Lorena Vizina, 23, had been smoking heroin on the night their baby daughter swallowed the substance

The one-year-old baby was rushed to hospital in Reno, Nevada after swallowing heroin left lying on the floor of her home by her parents

Social workers at the hospital called
the police and Robinson and the baby's mother Lorena Vizina, 23, an 
escort, were arrested on suspicion of child abuse and taken to Nevada's 
Washoe County Detention Center on Sunday.

Documents filed at Reno Justice Court stated that blood tests carried out on the baby revealed traces of morphine and coedine.

The one-year-old was still in a serious condition at the Renown Regional Medical Center on Monday.

The couple, who were in the process of packing at the weekend after 
being evicted from their apartment in Yori Avenue, told police they were
both addicted to methamphetamine and heroin.

Vizina said that she and Robinson 
smoked heroin on Saturday night before she left for work as an escort, 
leaving their daughter in her partner's care.

Robinson
told officers that he left the baby unattended on the living room floor
'for a few minutes' while he got dressed and washed his face and hair.

Robinson and Vizina had been notified that they were being evicted from their home in Yori Avenue, Reno, before the incident

The court documents stated that when Robinson returned he found his daughter with a 'white powdery substance' around her mouth.

The 25-year-old said he put his finger in her mouth to check for obstructions and found that the powder tasted like medication.

For
the next 45 minutes Robinson watched his daughter shaking and rolling 
her eyes, the court record said, before finally taking her to her 
grandparents' house and asking them if she looked okay.

Vizina's
parents had been babysitting for the child for 10 days before her 
23-year-old mother collected her on Saturday afternoon.

The couple are being held on bail at the Washoe County Detention Center.
