It seems that the only way is success for TOWIE stars Sam and Billie Faiers as they launch their new AW13 clothing range today.

The blonde sisters have unveiled their latest fashion range for their store, Minnies Boutique, and posed in a series of exclusive campaign images.

The reality TV stars have been running 
their lucrative business in Brentwood, Essex, for two years and have seen such success that they are launching a series of pop-up stores across the UK.

New range: TOWIE sisters Sam (L) and Billie (R) Faiers have launched and modelled their new a/w13 range, Sam wears the £125 Tempest dress, whilst Billie showcases the £16.50 Jovonnista Top

Older
sister Billie, 23, and Sam, 22, officially opened their first pop-up boutique
at the Corn Exchange in Manchester with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Saturday and are set to do the same in Southampton’s West Quay on Thursday.

Writing about their store on their website, the girls say: 'It is set in the beautiful cobbled back streets of Brentwood High Street, providing glamour and elegance.'

The girls sport typically glowing tans, toned physiques and blinding pearly whites in the campaign shots.

The
range, which includes colourful prints, fitted dresses complete with 
pussy-bow collars and winter knits, is priced between £16.50 and £125.

Red hot: Sam models a lace dress from her range, the Sugarhill Boutique £56

LBD: Billie models the £18 Vero Moda dress and says that a Little Black Dress is a wardrobe essential

Winter warmers: Jumpers are big… (quite literally) this season, say the girls. Here they model a striped knit for £75 (L) and £50 animal print sweater (R)

Something for everyone: The girls say their passion for fashion will cater for all wages, ages and any occasion. Sam models the £52 Sugarhill Boutique dress

Bold: The girls have clearly taken inspiration from the catwalk with their on-trend prints. Billie models the Neon Rose dress, £30

Speaking to MailOnline, Billie said: 'We were the first to open our business and the first to go out on the road with our Pop Up Tour. This Thursday we are in Southampton as part of the West Quay Student Takeover, we are also going to announce one more northern date and another southern date which will happen before the end of the year.'

Sam said: 'We have looked at sites for a new Minnies Boutique shop on a permanent basis, we had planned to open one this year but with our filming commitments and the success of the pop-ups we have decided to do this in early 2014.'

Winter essentials: The range, which has been designed for the 'sassy girl about town', includes coats too (L) Hershey Pascual, £90 and (R) Jovonnista, £79

Casual chic: There are casual clothes, like this Red Soul T-shirt, £26, and more formal pieces like the Jovonnista top, £49 (R)

'We also have plans for our own 
Minnies branded lines for next year, so watch this space – we are hard at 
work preparing to bring our own ranges to the high street.

'We
work really hard with Minnies and, as well as us working in the store on
a regular basis, myself and Billie are across all the buying decisions 
for the store.  

'We 
meet all the new brands and take control of the ordering, we hope you 
like what we have to offer from our Autumn / Winter collection at 
Minnies Boutique,' they added.

Minnie girls: Sam and Billie Faiers, seen 
promoting their pop-up store in Manchester on Friday, were dressed in
eye-catching pieces from their very own boutique

  1. Love thy Leather LookWhatever you do, don't pack away your leather pieces just yet as it will still be a key item for winter, feeding into the whole Gothic/glam trend. There was a heavy presence on the AW13 catwalks at Yves Saint Laurent and Louis Vuitton and we can see why. 

2. Thou shall be comfy in an oversized jumperJumpers are big… (quite literally) this season. Team this with anything from jeans, trousers, pencil or midi skirt to work and you'll be the envy of everyone in the office 3. Thou shall have a practical bagEvery time we open a magazine we can't help notice an army of celebrities with their trusty jute bags glued to their arm. Why? Because the jute bag is the modern day Mary Poppins bag, it fits so much in, you can easily use it for shopping, work, school books, college, the list goes on! 4. All hail leopard print (obvs!)It goes without saying that we like….OK, we LOVE a splash of animal print to our wardrobe, Burberry worked some stunning leopard print at its AW13 show.

 5. Thou shall embrace the LBDNo season or wardrobe would be complete without number five…. (drum roll) the LBD.
