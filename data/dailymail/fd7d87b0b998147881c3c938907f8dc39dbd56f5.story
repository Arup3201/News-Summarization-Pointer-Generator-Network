Paul Scholes believes that Liverpool do not have a strong enough squad to rest captain Steven Gerrard, and that the signings they made in the summer were not of the standard required.

The Reds captain was left out of the starting line-up in their 1-0 midweek defeat away at Real Madrid, only emerging from the bench in the second half after boss Brendan Rodgers sent out something of a second string XI at the Bernabeu.

And writing in the Independent, Scholes compared Rodgers' management of Gerrard with the way Sir Alex Ferguson dealt with him during his twilight years at Manchester United.

'I won a Champions League final six months before my 34th birthday,' said Scholes. 'You need a manager who knows when to play you and when to rest you. 

'Sir Alex Ferguson was brilliant at that. He would tell me that he had a game in mind for me, a week, 10 days ahead and to get myself ready to play.'

Scholes also went on to explain that he believes Liverpool's signings in the summer have not afforded them the opportunity to be able to rotate Gerrard effectively.

'Liverpool’s squad is not strong enough to allow Gerrard the rest he needs, even taking into account the performance in Madrid by a mainly second-string XI,' he added.

Scholes believes Sir Alex Ferguson knew how to manage him during his twilight years at United

'In my last few years at United we had the strength in depth that allowed the manager to be selective with my games. But Rodgers clearly feels that he has no alternative with Gerrard.

'Once again we go back to Liverpool’s signings in the summer. They did not recruit well enough. They are relying on the same players as last season to bring them through the big games. 

'Rodgers said as much before the Madrid game, that it was time for those who had not been playing to take responsibility.'
