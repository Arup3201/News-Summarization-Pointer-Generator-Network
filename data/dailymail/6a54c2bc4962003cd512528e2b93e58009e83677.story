Culture Secretary Maria Miller should be thrown out of the Cabinet and be forced to give up her Commons seat as punishment for making false expenses claims, according to a Mail on Sunday poll.

Voters also want the embattled Minister to be stripped of her role in charge of introducing new press curbs following Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into media ethics.

The damning findings come from the first survey conducted since Mrs Miller was forced to pay back £5,800 over-claimed on her mortgage and apologise to the Commons on Thursday.

Damning verdict: Maria Miller (pictured making her apology on Thursday) should be thrown out of the Cabinet and be forced to give up her Commons seat after making false expenses claims, says a Mail on Sunday poll

The results will pile pressure on David Cameron to do a U-turn over his refusal to sack her.

A senior Tory MP said last night that Mrs Miller was ‘dead in the water, politically speaking’ – and certain to be ditched in a Cabinet reshuffle before the summer.

‘It is natural for the PM to stand by her for now, but she will be gone by the party conference,’ said the MP.

A total of 78 per cent of those polled by Survation for The Mail on Sunday say Mrs Miller should lose her Cabinet seat.

'A ridiculous claim': The house in Basingstoke, Hampshire, that Mrs Miller listed as her primary residence

Ominously, the number of Tories who 
think she should be fired as Culture Secretary is 82 per cent. Only one 
in ten say she should stay in the Cabinet.

The survey also emphasises that, five years after the MPs’ expenses scandal erupted, public fury over politicians thought to be ‘on the fiddle’ is as intense as ever.

Humiliatingly, most people believe that kicking Mrs Miller out of the Cabinet is not sufficient retribution: nearly seven out of ten say she should be made to quit as the MP for Basingstoke.

Pressurised: The results will pile pressure on David Cameron to do a U-turn over his refusal to sack her

Defiant Mr Cameron’s decision to stand by her gets the thumbs-down from three-quarters of voters.

And two-thirds say Mrs Miller should relinquish her responsibility for introducing new press curbs following the phone hacking scandal triggered by Rupert Murdoch’s News International’s newspapers. Fewer than one in five say she should stay in control of the issue.

Mrs Miller’s 32-second Commons apology left voters deeply unimpressed – nearly three-quarters say her statement was inadequate.

The damning public verdict came as it emerged that Mrs Miller had tried to browbeat the independent Commons’ standards watchdog investigating complaints over her expenses claims on her second home in Wimbledon, South London, where her parents lived.

Mrs Miller listed her primary residence as a rented home in her Hampshire constituency.

As part of a series of emails to Standards Commissioner Kathryn Hudson, the Culture Secretary even threatened to report her to the Commons’ Standards Committee if she did not conclude the inquiry, and  branded one line of questioning from Mrs Hudson as ‘unwarranted and wrong’.

The Culture Secretary’s adviser Jo Hindley was accused of trying to ‘flag up’ Mrs Miller’s key role in stricter press regulation in a bid to suppress coverage of the affair – a claim Ms Hindley rejects. 

No  10 has also denied trying to threaten a newspaper investigating the Minister’s expenses with tougher regulation of the press.

Formal apology: Maria's 32-second apology to the Commons on Thursday was appalling, writes Mr Heath

Making a statement: It was written all over the Culture Secretary's face that she didn't want to do it, he adds

Mrs Miller was last week forced to apologise after a 16-month investigation. The Standards Committee was scathing about her attitude to the inquiry, accusing her of taking a ‘legalistic’ approach and providing a ‘totally inadequate response’ to one of Mrs Hudson’s inquiries.

But controversially, it over-ruled Mrs Hudson’s insistence that Mrs Miller repay almost £45,000 of the £90,000 allowances she claimed over four years, claiming she had acted ‘reasonably’ in declaring the London property as her second home.

It said she should only repay £5,800 overclaimed in mortgage interest in 2009.

Political figures: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (right) declined to come to Mr Cameron's aid over the issue yesterday, but Conservative chairman Grant Shapps (left) said it was time to 'draw a line' under the controversy

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg declined to come to Mr Cameron’s aid over the issue yesterday, saying: ‘All the issues to do with her position and indeed to do with the behaviour of her office, alleged or not, is entirely a matter for the Prime Minister.’

But Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said it was time to ‘draw a line’ under the controversy.

'I can't see Maria changing': Phil Heath is Mrs Miller's former campaign organiser

Years before Maria Miller’s dodgy expenses were reported in the media, I tried to bring it to the public’s attention.

I noticed it soon after I started working on her campaign that resulted in her being elected MP for Basingstoke in 2005.

I came to realise that she is the sort who claims for everything. It’s part of what I call ‘Maria’s culture’. She would even claim for parking in her own constituency.

As for her insistence that the house in Wimbledon was her second home – thus allowing her to claim expenses on it – I thought it was ridiculous because she seemed to spend as little time as possible in Basingstoke. 

From what I could see, her family were based in Wimbledon. I tried to raise my concerns with Conservative Party officials but they didn’t want to know.

In my view, the Commons Standards Commissioner got it right but MPs let her off the hook. It was a stitch-up.

Talking to people in cafes around Basingstoke yesterday, they were saying: ‘She’s got away with it.’ Maria’s 32-second apology to the Commons was appalling. It was written all over her face that she didn’t want to do it.

And I know that arrogant look so well. It says: ‘I’m right and everyone else is wrong. How dare anybody question me. Don’t you know who I am?’

But the people of Basingstoke are saying: ‘Hang on a minute. Never mind apologising to MPs, what about apologising to us, and what about apologising for taking public money that you aren’t entitled to?’

'Maria's culture': Mrs Miller claims for everything, even for parking in her own constituency, says Mr Heath

I can’t see Maria changing. She has no truck with criticism locally and heaven help anyone like me who has the temerity to question her word.

Nobody complains about Maria  – not if they want to stay a Conservative, as I found out. It was like I dared to say the Madonna was not a virgin!

Even though I helped her win a majority in 2005 of more than 4,500, on Election day itself she was ranting and raving and thought she was going to lose.

'Arrogant look': Mr Heath says he was 'so appalled' by Mrs Miller's behaviour that he voted for her Labour rival even though he was effectively her campaign manager at the time. Above, Mrs Miller outside Downing Street

I told her to get out of the room, saying that we would get her elected, and that she should leave everybody else alone. 

I was so appalled by her behaviour, I voted for her Labour rival even though I was effectively her campaign manager and I was a Tory councillor at the time.

After a while, the Tories made it clear they didn’t want me.

I later joined UKIP. It was the best thing I ever did.
