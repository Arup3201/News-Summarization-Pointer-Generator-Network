A man wanted for allegedly killing three people and injuring two others in a Christmas Day shooting at a New Jersey strip club was arrested on Sunday at his mother's home in Florida, authorities have confirmed.

Anthony Fields, 19, of Newark, New Jersey, was being held on $2 million bail after being arrested without incident by the FBI about 6.30am at his mother's home in Orlando, Florida, according to Katherine Carter, a spokeswoman for Acting Essex County prosecutor Carolyn Murray.

Proceedings to extradite him to New Jersey will begin on Monday, Carter said.

Under arrest: Anthony Fields has been arrested in Florida and charged with three counts of murder and two counts of assault after allegedly opening fire at a New Jersey strip club on Christmas Day

Fields faces three counts of murder, two counts of assault, and charges of possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.

Fields is accused of opening fire at Slick's Go-Go Bar in Irvington, New Jersey, about 15 miles west of New York City.

Authorities said the shooting occurred after a bouncer at the club refused to let him enter the premises at 12.45am on December 25 because he was visibly carrying a gun.

'The bouncer noticed the weapon and told him he could not enter with the weapon,' Carter said.

Killed in the ensuing gunfire were Pierre Clervoyant, 34, of Elizabeth, New Jersey, Woodley Daniel, 32, of Hillside, New Jersey, and Mushir Cureton, 27, of Newark.

Two others were wounded.Â 

The alleged murders and aggravated assaults occurred here at Slick's Go Go Bar in Irvington, about 15 miles west of New York City, on December 25

Slick's is located in an industrial area of Irvington, a few blocks from
 the Garden State Parkway.

Roughly 100 people were in the club when the 
shooting occurred, according to NBC New York.

The killings were part of a spate of violence that plagued the region 
during the holiday season. Three teenagers were killed in Newark, 
including a 13-year-old girl hit by a stray bullet on Christmas night, 
and a pregnant woman was allegedly murdered by her husband in East 
Orange.
