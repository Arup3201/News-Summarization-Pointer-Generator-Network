Back at work: Teacher Geoffrey Bettley at his 
home after it was revealed he'd escaped a classroom ban despite 
downloading almost 200 child porn images

More paedophiles have been cleared to work in classrooms by the Department for Education, it emerged yesterday.

Teachers convicted or cautioned for viewing child porn have been given permission to continue with their careers by senior officials.

It means thousands of children could be coming into contact with individuals with criminal records for the offence.

A DfE source confirmed the potential 
threat in schools the day after married father-of-four Geoffrey Bettley 
was revealed to have escaped a ban despite downloading almost 200 
sickening images.

The 
religious education teacher was given a police caution and put on the 
Sex Offenders’ Register, but the DfE ruled any action against him should
be ‘proportionate’.

Details emerged as:

Bettley, 36, could have been given a prohibition order which would have prevented him from working with children.

Instead,
the professional conduct panel of the National College for Teaching and
Leadership said he ‘does not pose a risk to children’.

The
NCTL recommendation was sent to the DfE where an official acting on Mr 
Gove’s behalf agreed, despite saying his behaviour ‘falls significantly 
short of that expected of a teacher’.

A DfE source yesterday admitted a 
‘handful’ of teachers who had been convicted or cautioned for viewing 
child porn had escaped bans.

The source added: ‘All the cases we have come across so far are not in the classroom, we believe.’

But the source admitted some might be working in schools.

Conservative MP Philip Davies called on Mr Gove to explain himself, saying: ‘Many parents will be deeply disturbed that someone who has been convicted of downloading child porn should be allowed to teach again.’

Fellow Tory Priti Patel said: ‘The public need to know of individuals who have been convicted of these awful crimes and who are in our schools.’ 

Meg Munn, the Labour chairman of the all-party Parliamentary group on child protection, said that no one with Bettley’s background should be allowed in a school.

‘It isn’t just about whether they may or may not go on to abuse children,’ she said.

‘Children have already been abused because their pictures have appeared and these people have compounded that abuse by looking at it.’

'Many parents will be deeply disturbed': Conservative MP Philip Davies called on Education Secretary Michael Gove to explain himself, while Priti Patel said the public 'need to know' which teachers had been convicted

Peter Saunders, of the  National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘The public have an absolute right to know how many decisions like this there have been. We are talking about the worst crime we’ve got.’

From yesterday's Mail

The NASUWT teachers’ union was drawn into the scandal when it was revealed that a letter from a regional official to the NCTL’s lawyers argued that Bettley should be given the chance to ‘rebuild his life and hopefully his career’.

It asked them to ‘consider the impact a prohibition order would have on Mr Bettley and his young family’.

The union said Bettley had endured ‘two periods of sustained absence from school due to stress, which resulted in him requiring counselling’.

Bettley taught at St Mary’s Catholic High School in Menston, West Yorkshire, until December 2011, when he was sacked. He was placed on a ‘barred list’ by the Independent Safeguarding Authority but his name was removed last year.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We want to ensure that anyone cautioned or prosecuted for offences related to child pornography is prohibited from teaching. We are taking steps to revise the guidance the independent panel uses to make a decision on whether a teacher should be barred.’

NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ‘Unions are governed by strict legal and regulatory provisions which cover the entitlement of members to representation.’
