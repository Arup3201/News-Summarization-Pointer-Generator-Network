Players and managers in the Barclays Premier League will be told the doctor’s decision must be final as part of a new directive designed to protect players from head injuries.

New rules are being introduced this season after high-profile concussions involving Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and Everton striker Romelu Lukaku and a series of incidents at the World Cup.

Clear guidelines will be brought in for the Premier League campaign starting on Saturday week which will state that the doctor’s decision is paramount when it comes to deciding whether or not a player can continue.

New rule: The Premier League will introduce a tunnel doctor to oversee any head collisions

Right decision? Hugo Lloris clashed with Romelu Lukaku last season but finished the match against Everton

Dangerous: The Spurs medical staff came under criticism for allowing Lloris to continue

Under new guidelines to deal with head injuries, even if there is no loss of consciousness then an assessment should take place on the pitch or the touchline to judge whether there is a risk of concussion.

It follows a number of incidents last season, including at the World Cup, where players continued despite appearing to have been concussed.

The new guidelines state: 'If there has been a confirmed or suspected period of loss of consciousness, the player must be removed from the field of play, and not be allowed to return.

Speaking out: The Mail On Sunday have campaigned for change to the rules across sports

The Mail on Sunday has led the way in urging the governing bodies of all sports, but especially football and rugby, to properly concussion.

Since launching the campaign last September support has grown with everyone from politicians to stars across the pond agreeing the issue needs to be addressed. Our efforts have seen calls for a cross-party parliamentary inquiry in to the issue. 

In November the Rugby Football Union announced that they will consider mandatory concussion training for all players and will review the controversial Pitch-side Concussion Assessment protocol.

And now football, too, has taken steps to properly protect players from what is a dangerous occurrence in sport. One that, if not addressed properly, can lead to serious long-term problems.

'If there is any doubt as to the course of events, elucidation may be sought from officials or other players. In the event that there is video replay available pitch-side or in the players' tunnel, this could be used to clarify the course of events.

'Where no loss of consciousness is apparent an on-field or touchline assessment will take place.'

There must also be an additional 'tunnel doctor' present at all Premier League games, who can study video replays and help the club doctors assess potential concussion injuries with information which may have been missed by the medical team on the touchline.

A concussion recognition tool-kit will be supplied warning of the symptoms to look for and how to respond. This will be supplied to all clubs and carried by all medical practitioners, and will advise that players must come off, even if concussion is only 'suspected'.

Players will also be submitted to baseline cognitive assessment in pre-season to help doctors manage their recovery after a head injury.

The Premier League will also remind all clubs to comply with the FIFA-approved guidelines issued by the Concussion in Sports Group (CISG) in Zurich in 2012, stating that athletes in all sports should not return to action for a minimum of six to seven days.

It is in conjunction with a poster campaign to raise awareness of concussion in football, which will be promoted through the Football League and into the grassroots of the game by the Football Association.

Injury: Germany's Christoph Kramer (centre) gets hit in the face by Ezequiel Garay during the World Cup final

Off: The German youngster played on after the collision but was eventually substituted 

England players Steven Gerrard, Rickie Lambert, Phil Jones and Luke Shaw appear in a video to publicise the key messages, such as 'don’t be a hero', 'listen to the medics' and 'get off the pitch'.

Leading brain injury charity Headway has welcomed the changes. 'The measures are a significant step forward in the protection of footballers at all levels and therefore are warmly welcomed,' said chief executive Peter McCabe.

'The more we know about head and brain injury, the better we understand the risks of continuing to play competitive sport following a concussion. The guidelines at all levels, from FIFA to the FA and Premier League, have to date been insufficient and ineffective, as demonstrated by numerous high-profile examples.

'It is vital that decisions regarding a player’s suitability to return to the field of play are made by independent doctors, with measures put in place to protect them against pressure from club staff or the players themselves.'

These are the changes brought in to help football’s medics after the findings from a working group established during last season after the Lloris and Lukaku incidents, and chaired by England doctor Ian Beasley.

Spurs keeper Lloris was knocked unconscious in a clash with Lukaku in November but ignored medical advice and insisted on returning to the pitch to continue.

Groggy: Romelu Lukaku was knocked out in the action of scoring for Everton against West Ham last season 

Keep going: The Belgian forward briefly received treatment before playing on in the Premier League clash

Manager Andre Villas-Boas backed his player rather than his doctor - which he will not be able to do under the new rules – but subsequent tests ruled Lloris out of the next two Tottenham games. The goalkeeper did not play again for 12 days.

'There are worldwide guidelines but people in football are unaware,' said Arsenal doctor Gary O’Driscoll, the chair of the Premier League doctors’ group. 'It is a relatively uncommon injury in football and the science of concussion is very poorly understood.

'We must stop this feeling that it’s a brave or heroic decision to stay on and that’s it’s an injury you can run off. The doctor’s decision must be final.'

Tottenham doctor Shabaaz Mughal was part of the working group, as were experts like Simon Kemp, head of sports medicine at the RFU, Michael Turner, horseracing’s chief medical officer, and neurosurgeon Peter Hamlyn. 

Collision: Georginio Wijnaldum kicks the ball as Javier Mascherano tries a header during the World Cup

Down: The Argentina star stumbled to the ground after the sickening collision

Earlier in the season, Lukaku had been knocked out while scoring for Everton at West Ham and confessed he could not remember anything about the goal. Still, he was allowed to play on, as was Stoke’s Robert Huth in a game against Manchester City.

The exposure of these incidents convinced those in football that something had to be done and their instinct seemed to be confirmed when Uruguay’s Alvaro Perreira and Argentina’s Javier Mascherano both continued to play after being knocked briefly unconscious during World Cup games.

Some changes were made to Premier League protocol after Petr Cech fractured his skull playing for Chelsea against Reading in 2006, making it compulsory to have a doctor on the bench and making sure an ambulance was on stand-by at the ground for players.

These changes were credited with helping to keep Fabrice Muamba alive after his heart attack playing for Bolton at Tottenham in 2012.
