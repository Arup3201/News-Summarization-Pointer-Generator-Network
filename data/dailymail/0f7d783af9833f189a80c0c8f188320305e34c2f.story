Rory McIlroy will have a metaphorical target on his back at this week's Ryder Cup in the same way Tiger Woods did in his heyday, according to Europe legend Colin Montgomerie.

Montgomerie, the triumphant captain at Celtic Manor in 2010 and a giant of the competition during his playing appearances, believes all 12 members of the United States team will relish the chance of claiming McIlroy's scalp if they are drawn against the Open and US PGA champion in the foursomes, fourballs or singles matches.

The Northern Irishman was the first player spotted on the driving range at Gleneagles on Monday morning, clearly looking to get his game into the best shape well in advance of the start of the three-day competition on Friday.

McIlroy was soon joined by Ian Poulter, with whom he enjoyed a morale-boosting fist bump, and later Thomas Bjorn, who warmed up in the chilly Scottish air with a hot cup of coffee. 

McIlroy told BBC Radio 5live: 'I arrived here yesterday evening and hit some balls last night, I just wanted to get here a bit early and make sure I am prepared for Friday. It's been a long stretch (of golf) for me.

"I just wanted to try and take as much time as I could off and get away from the game a little bit but obviously excited about this week. It will be good to meet up with all the team later this evening and I think once that happens I think we will all get into the spirit of it and be really excited.'

McIlroy was seen working hard on his swing, and the four-time major champion and world No 1 looks ready to prove his status as the game's brightest star this week. But Montgomerie had a warning for the 25-year-old Ulsterman.

'Rory is the one player that America wants to play because they've nothing to lose,' the 51-year-old Scot told the Daily Express.

'It was a bit like that for us against Tiger. When we did draw him we would say "Game on, I've got a chance here. If he beats me he's supposed to beat me, if he doesn't, well, what a day for me and what a day for the team."'

Montgomerie, who featured in eight Ryder Cups as a player, said Europe captain Paul McGinley may be tempted to 'hide' McIlroy in the opening foursomes or fourballs on Friday and Saturday.

'I think a lot of pressure is on Rory's shoulders,' explained the eight-times order of merit winner. 'If the rest of the team see Rory winning it gives them confidence.

'If the team see Rory losing in one of the first groups then it's difficult to think 'we've got to pick up the pieces' so it's a huge temptation to hide him away.

'You don't want to put your main star out at No 1 because the rookies in the American team can play and any one of them can score a 66 and win,' said Montgomerie who is Europe's third highest Ryder Cup points scorer of all time with 23 1/2.

'I would definitely be for hiding Rory the way Tiger was many times. We expected him at No 1 in the singles in 2006 for instance when America were well down at the K Club and he turned up at No 4.'

McIlroy's last competitive outing saw him battling for a £7million payday in the Tour Championship, but he is equally fired up by the thought of playing for team glory at the Ryder Cup. 

He famously labelled the Ryder Cup as an 'exhibition' the year before his debut in 2010, but contributing to narrow victories at Celtic Manor and Medinah means he appreciates the special nature of the biennial contest.

'It's a group of people that you know well and they all have one goal, one collective task which is to win the Ryder Cup and beat the US team,' McIlroy told BBC Radio Five Live.

'The money doesn't matter to us any more, it doesn't matter if we're playing for millions of pounds all over the world. This means as much to us or even more than any other thing that we play for. It's a big deal to us, we want to play as well as we can and try to win.

'I arrived here yesterday evening and hit some balls last night, I just wanted to get here a bit early and make sure I am prepared for Friday. It's been a long stretch (of golf) for me.

'I just wanted to try and take as much time as I could off and get away from the game a little bit but obviously excited about this week. It will be good to meet up with all the team later this evening and I think once that happens I think we will all get into the spirit of it and be really excited.'
