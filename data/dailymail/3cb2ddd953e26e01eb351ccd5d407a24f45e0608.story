The bus is gasping and shuddering its way down the potholed street, causing my fellow passengers to tut and grumble. The irritating 'tssk, tssk, tssk' tinny drumbeat from someone's iPod is seeping through the cacophony of yells from school children exchanging insults at the back. Outside the bus, a police siren is wailing.

But what do I care? I am cocooned in the land of nod, my head engulfed by a huge sound-proofed cushion that resembles a giant balaclava crossed with an old-fashioned diving helmet, with just my nose and mouth on display.

Out there it may be chaos, but in here I am napping in style. Of sorts.

Napping - in style? The Ostrich Pillow looks like a giant balaclava crossed with an old-fashioned diving helmet

I'm wearing an Ostrich Pillow, the brainchild of Key Portilla-Kawamura and Ali Ganjavian who set up a design studio after meeting at university in London in the 1990s. Their aim was to create simple solutions to everyday needs. And where better to start than with the Western world's chronic lack of sleep?

'Power-napping improves productivity by 34 per cent,' explains Ali. 'We spend so much time at work, in front of a screen or in transit, we thought: “Why not create something that helps us disconnect and dream?”

'All you have to do is find a place to nap, slip on the Ostrich Pillow and away you go.'

Whether it's a noisy bedfellow, restless children, worrying about work or one too many late-night coffees, long-term lack of sleep now afflicts one in three Britons.

In fact, last year's Great British Sleep Survey found that poor slumberers are three times as likely to have trouble concentrating and twice as likely to have relationship problems and suffer low moods as good sleepers.

Pillow talk: Nicole catches up on some shut-eye while on a bus

As the type who wakes if there's a glimmer of light coming through the shutters and whose boyfriend snores like a train, there's little I wouldn't do for an extra 40 winks during the day.

So, buoyed by the promise of 45 minutes shut-eye on my commute to work, I place an order for the £65 Ostrich Pillow - so-called because once it's on, you are 'buried' away from the outside world like an ostrich burying its head in the sand.

All the pillows are handmade in Spain and it's obvious a lot of love has gone into the product. Mine arrives with its own carry bag emblazoned with the words 'Dream With Me: Dreams Are Today's Answers to Tomorrow's Questions'.

The pillow is, in fact, more of a helmet, albeit one made from ultra-soft jersey padded out with 'smart micro balls' which are similar to beanbag filling but much more fine. This means you can slump against the side of . . . well, just about anywhere, and not feel the vibrations from the train, bus or plane.

Despite its size, it's as light as helium and the micro balls are coated in a special silicone, meaning they don't make a beanbag-esque noise when you lean against them.

Once squashed down, my Ostrich Pillow just about fits in my (admittedly sizeable) handbag and I trundle along to start my commute.

Jumping on the bus, I leg it up to the top deck and into a much-coveted seat by the window, upon which I can rest my weary head. Bingo!

I get out the pillow, cast a nervous glance around and pull it on.

I may not be able to see a thing, but I know I look daft - my boyfriend compared me to an alien when I tried it on at home.

Thankfully, anyone who has ever lived in or visited the capital can testify that Londoners aren't fazed by anything. You could walk down the street barefoot in the snow and no one would blink an eye.

After the faint sounds of a few sniggers fade away, my fellow passengers go back to playing Candy Crush Saga on their phones, leaving me free to nab the first of the day's power-naps. Who's silly now, eh?

Shrouded from the outside world, I find my new headgear luxuriously soft and toasty.

Despite the enclosed nature of the thing, the Ostrich Pillow isn't at all claustrophobic as it's not tight.

And because it's physically wrapped around your head, it's not going to do that pesky thing that a regular pillow does when you're using it sitting up, i.e. falling away every time you adjust your position, leaving you crick-necked, angry and no less tired. Indeed, it's so comfortable and quiet inside one, there's a real danger you could drift off and miss your stop.

Roused by the alarm on my phone as my 45-minute journey nears its end, I alight feeling refreshed, if a little silly.

There's no way around it: this gizmo will ruin your hairdo. But on the upside, if you're tired enough to be wearing it, it's probable you didn't put too much effort into your barnet that morning anyway.

After a morning in the office feeling a little more alert than normal, I donned the Ostrich Pillow again at Pret A Manger after my lunchtime bowl of soup - this time, popping my hands in the two holes either side of the helmet that allow you to keep your mitts nice and warm while you rest, face down, on a flat surface.

Embarrassing: Nicole dons the pillow at a Pret A Manger, amusing the man sitting next to her

I think it embarrassed the man sitting next to me more than it did me. But, being a Londoner, he didn't say a word.

After work, and a final five-minute snooze while waiting for a friend at the Tate Gallery (where my napping was interrupted by a security guard who looked most unamused, asking me to move along), I headed off to take the train home.

People at Victoria Station were a little more inquisitive about my headwear. One lady asked me, in all seriousness, if I was wearing a dog's bodywarmer over my head.

But even the inevitable signalling delays didn't get me down. They just meant another opportunity to grab 40 winks, this time while standing.

Besides the embarrassment factor, there are other downsides to the Ostrich Pillow. It's warm, verging on the too warm. While it would be good for planes, sofas or in well-ventilated areas, wrapping a mini-beanbag around your face is not comfortable in a packed, sweaty train carriage.

But, eager to respond to customer feedback, Ali and Key's firm, Studio Banana Things, recently unveiled the Ostrich Pillow Light.

Constructed of the same jersey and polystyrene balls, this version wraps around your eyes and ears only in a Bruce Springsteen-style headband, leaving your neck and the top of your head exposed to the elements.

You may look as if you're living in a virtual reality world while it's on your head, but the Ostrich Light can, at least, be pulled down and worn around the neck as a scarf when you're awake, and is much less bulky.

Mock all you like, but a month after its launch, the company have 1,400 orders worth almost £50,000, so they're obviously onto something.

After all, when you're that tired, and a pillow is this comfortable, who gives a damn what you look like?

An adult size costs £65, children £50 (studiobananathings.com/ buy-ostrich-pillow).
