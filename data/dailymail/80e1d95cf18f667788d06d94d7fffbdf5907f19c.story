An engineer hanged himself  days after a controversial group of ‘paedophile hunters’ accused him of grooming a child over the internet.

Gary Cleary was arrested by police after being confronted in public by the vigilante group called Letzgo Hunting whose members lure suspected sex offenders into meetings by posing as young girls online.

The 29-year-old, who lived with his girlfriend, was released on bail while officers looked into the allegation, but was found dead in the garage at his home four days later. A coroner last week recorded a verdict of suicide.

Trap: A suspect runs from a member of Letzgo Hunting who lure suspected sex offenders into meetings by posing as young girls online

Mr Cleary lived with Melissa Andrews 
and their dog at Newbold Verdon, Leicestershire. A relative of college 
worker Miss Andrews said: ‘It’s a tragedy and has left everyone 
extremely upset. The family have been told by the police that their 
investigation is still ongoing.’

The relative, who asked not to be 
named, went on to criticise the actions of Letzgo Hunting. He said: ‘I 
think it is a sad reflection on modern life that vigilantes are 
operating under cover of the internet. It puts the country back 300 
years.’

Miss Andrews, 30, was unavailable for comment.

Letzgo Hunting, which was set up by a 
group of concerned parents earlier this year, has achieved a high 
profile after posting videos of members confronting suspected 
paedophiles on the internet.

It has created dozens of profiles on dating and social networking websites pretending to be girls aged 12 to 15.

Chase: The footage of the suspect running away was posted by the vigilante group on YouTube

The group then exchanges messages with
 those it considers to be ‘interested’ men, sometimes for weeks, before 
luring them into meetings in parks or other public areas and filming the
 confrontations.

The footage is uploaded on to Letzgo 
Hunting’s website and Facebook page, as well as YouTube, initially with 
the alleged suspects’ faces visible.

If an arrest is made, the images are 
taken down and doctored, so the men can no longer be identified, before 
being uploaded once more.

Last night Letzgo Hunting’s founder 
told the Daily Mail he has no regrets about the group’s actions, and 
said they will continue to work to expose ‘people who pose a risk to 
children’.

The man, who used to call himself 
Scummbuster but now likes to be known as Jamie, said: ‘We are convinced 
this man was a danger to children, that is why we arranged to meet him.

‘Plenty of people we come into contact
 with only want to talk dirty with our online ‘‘decoys’’ but he wanted 
to take things further. We feel sorry for his family for the loss of 
their son but our work will continue.’

Group: The website of 'Letzgo Hunting', a group of 'paedophile hunters' who confronted a 29-year-old who killed himself after he was arrested

Mr Cleary was confronted in Braunstone Park, Leicester, four months ago.

As he walked across the grass to meet 
an 18-year-old ‘decoy’ who Letzgo Hunting say he believed to be a 
14-year-old, he was confronted by two men from the group.

They say they asked him why he was 
meeting an under-aged girl with a sexual motive but he fled, swearing at
 the men, before they could even tell him who they were. He was arrested
 a few days later, on May 9, after detectives were handed footage of the
 meeting. He was released on bail, before being found dead on May 13.

A spokesman for Leicestershire Police 
would not confirm Mr Cleary’s name but said the man who went on to kill 
himself was arrested following information which was supplied by a 
‘third party’.

He added: ‘He was questioned and released on police bail. He was not charged with any criminal offence.

‘On May 13 we were called to his 
address and discovered his body.’ Earlier this year the force warned 
that such vigilante activity could ‘seriously affect the chances of 
success in court, preventing victims from getting justice’.

During Mr Cleary’s inquest in 
Loughborough last Thursday, coroner Trevor Kirkman did not refer to any 
encounter with Letzgo Hunting or his arrest.

Direct action: Letzgo Hunting's website says that the police are failing communities so they take gathering evidence into their own hands to get arrests

But he told his parents David, 65, and
 Susan, 62, who declined to comment after the hearing: ‘This is not a 
court in which one apportions blame as such and nobody is on trial, 
still less your son.

‘Whatever may have occurred, or whatever may be thought to have occurred, is not a matter I need to go into.

‘What I have to deal with is how he 
came by his death and the means by which he came by his death. I am 
satisfied I should record that he came by his death at his own hands.

‘Whatever may have happened, the people who are left to pick up the pieces are those that love him.’

‘Jamie’ from Letzgo Hunting, who 
claims to work in the security industry, has previously explained that 
he decided to create the group with close friends in the Hinckley area 
of Leicestershire after someone he knew was convicted of offences 
against a child and possession of indecent images of children.

He said the group posts profiles of 
teenage minors on dating and social networking websites such as Badoo – 
where he said Mr Cleary was found – and Bebo. He said the first thing 
Letzgo Hunting ‘decoys’ did when they got into a conversation with a man
 online was to say: ‘I am only 14.’ Mr Cleary’s parents declined to 
comment at their home near Leicester. A neighbour said: ‘They’re 
devastated.’

Work: The group's confrontations have led to 12 arrests, but nobody has been charged, Leicestershire Police say
