A mother broke down in tears as she was cleared of causing or allowing the death of her four-month-old baby daughter today.

Kelly-Marie Rayner, 26, was accused of contributing to the death of baby Kiera Conlin, on May 6 last year.

But Mr Justice Royce directed the jury at Winchester Crown Court to deliver a not guilty verdict against banking advisor Ms Rayner, three weeks into the trial.

Kelly-Marie Rayner, 26, was accused of contributing to the death of baby Kiera Conlin, on May 6 last year, but was today cleared by a jury

The child's father, Ross Conlin, 29, is alleged to have shaken Kiera in anger so hard that she had a heart attack and stopped 
breathing, while he was looking after her alone.

The charges against him remain.

The
 crown allege he caused her fatal injuries, including eight rib 
fractures, three skull fractures and bleeding in her eye sockets.

Ms Rayner was met by her family outside court where she was embraced by her stepfather Paul Rayner and mother Dawn.

Mr Justice Royce told the jury of three women and nine men: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I’m sorry you have been delayed in the resumption of this trial.

'The position at the end of the prosecution case was that certain legal matters required discussion.

'The result of that is I have determined the case against Kelly Rayner should go no further.

'It’s my responsibility even though she is in your charge.

A jury at  Winchester Crown Court delivered a not guilty verdict against banking advisor Ms Rayner, three weeks into the trial. The child's father, Ross Conlin, 29, is alleged to have shaken Kiera in anger so hard that she had a heart attack and stopped breathing, while he was looking after her alone. The charges against him remain

'In effect, you are all agreed in your verdict you find her not guilty. I take responsibility on that.

'Mr Conlin remains charged on the counts he faces.'

Ms Rayner then stood, thanked the judge and the jury and left the court.

Debt collector Conlin, said to be stressed out at work, denies murder and three charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent in her tragic last months.

On May 6 last year, Kiera was rushed to hospital from her grandparents’ home in Farnborough, Hampshire.

At the time, Conlin was alone with her while Rayner, a banking advisor, was out for a nail appointment and grandfather Paul Rayner was at B&Q.

Conlin dialled 999, saying his daughter was ‘limp’ having not been breathing for four minutes.

Paramedics revived the youngster and took her to Frimley Park Hospital, but she was later transferred to Southampton General Hospital, for expert treatment.

Despite this, she was pronounced brain dead and a life support machine was turned off at 6.30pm the next day.

She died in her mother’s arms at 7pm.

The trial continues.
