A mother-of-five lied about having cancer - even to her children - and collected tens of thousands of dollars of donations in a startling scam that lasted for two years, police have said.

Alissa Jackson, a married 31-year-old nurse from Belleville, Illinois, told friends and family she had stage IV ovarian cancer that was spreading to her organs and brain.

They rallied around her - setting up a Facebook page entitled 'Alissa's Army' and helping to sell t-shirts, throw parties, make food for her family and collect donations from local businesses.

Many people were touched by the story on her Facebook page, which explained she had five young children and that she had previously been a drug addict before turning her life around.

'Lies': Alissa Jackson, 31, (pictured left in a police photo and right during her alleged scam) allegedly lied about having terminal cancer for two years and raised $35,000. She has been charged with felony theft

One friend speculated that they had helped her raise around $35,000, the Belleville News-Democrat reported.

But about two months ago, some of her friends became suspicious of her claims when they noticed inconsistencies in her story - including seeing her chase a dog - and contacted police.

Officers carried out the investigation over a month and learned that she had allegedly never been diagnosed with cancer.

Dana McQuade, who sent Jackson cleaning supplies, told the News-Democrat Alissa that the friends had started questioning her claims when they saw her at some local batting cages.

'She's chasing 
after her dog,' McQuade said. 'Jenn said, "Wait a minute, this isn't 
right. She's doing something that someone with stage four ovarian cancer
 wouldn't be doing".'

McQuade said Jackson called her on Sunday and confessed to the lies.

Support: Jackson, pictured with her husband, had support from across the world from relatives and strangers

'It
 would have been the easiest thing in the world for her to produce a 
medical record with a doctor's diagnosis that she has stage four ovarian
 cancer - but she couldn't,' McQuade said.

'She was bawling on the phone.
 She was saying, "I didn't mean to hurt anybody. I don't want to go to 
jail. My husband is going to leave me."

'And I told her, "You need to do 
the right thing and turn yourself in".'

It is not known how much her husband Brandon knew about her lies.

Among the donations, she allegedly took more than $500 from local Pizza Hut restaurants that donated 20 per cent of their profits one day last month.

A local bar, JR's Last Call, also gave her $1,400 in cash, while one woman gave more than $500 buying and selling t-shirts for the 'cause' earlier this year, a criminal complaint alleges.

'The deepest form of being a lowlife in 
my eyes to fake a disease like cancer that so many people fight and lose -
 it's just, it's unconceivable that someone could do it,' JR's bar manager 
Pam Bruce told KDSK.

Revelation: Her alleged scam emerged after two friends grew suspicious of her story after seeing her chase a dog and they contacted police - who learned she had allegedly never had cancer

Fake: Friends formed a fundraising group called 'Alissa's Army' to sell t-shirts and organize collections

One of the friends who contacted police, Jenn Huelsmann, said that reactions to the revelations had been varied but that they had simply wanted to do the right thing.

'This situation has been very sad and 
heartbreaking,' Huelsmann said. 'We ask that everyone please, for the 
sake of the people involved, consider the feelings of Alissa's children 
and understand that people closest to her made the best choices we could
 based on the information that we had.'

The News-Democrat reported that a reporter spoke to Jackson's mother-in-law, who insisted that Jackson did have cancer.

She was charged on Wednesday with two counts of felony theft and her bond was set at $100,000.

Belleville police said that the scam had reached people across the world.

'To the hundreds of people who donated to "Alissa’s Army": Do not let Jackson’s evil prevent you from helping 
people in the future,' Belleville police said in a statement on Wednesday.
