Arsenal appear to be edging ever closer to securing an early replacement for Bacary Sagna, with Toulouse right-back Serge Aurier struggling to keep things under wraps.

Sagna confirmed last week that he was leaving the club, giving Arsene Wenger an easy starting point for his summer recruitment.

Aurier has been linked with a £7.5m switch for some time, and when posing with a Gunners fan on film, seemed to confirm that he was on his way to the Premier League.

Target: The right-back has been in fine form for Toulouse and has been linked with a £7.5m switch

The Youtube clip, entitled 'Serge Aurier tells Arsenal fan he is going to Arsenal' shows Twitter account holder @Kandzet with the star, and was also retweeted by Aurier's official account.

The 21-year-old was warming up for the Ivory Coast's World Cup warm-up with Bosnia-Herzegovina when he spoke to the onlooker.

The transfer window only opened on Sunday and while Arsenal are expected to spend big to compete for the title, Wenger had admitted he didn't expect to conduct much business until after the World Cup.

But Sagna's announcement may have pushed the French boss into action, with Aurier's stock sure to rise in Brazil this summer. He was also named in Ligue 1's Team of the Year of last season, further boosting his reputation.

Atsuto Uchida and Callum Chambers were also thought to be on the club's radar to compete with Carl Jenkinson for the full-back slot, but the self-confessed Arsenal fan has leapfrogged the duo.

He talked up the move in May, telling Eurosport France: 'I’ve never prioritised a club in England as even the promoted clubs are respectable. I will privilege the one that will show the most interest in me, that will give me the most game time. After that, you can’t really say no to Arsenal.

'It’s a club with history, with a French manager, who has welcomed many Francophones. Plus, Arsenal are always thereabouts when it comes to trophies and a club that plays in the Champions League.'

Aurier has also taken pictures of himself wearing an Gunners shirt in the past, and retweeted other articles and blogs relating to a summer switch to the Emirates Stadium.
