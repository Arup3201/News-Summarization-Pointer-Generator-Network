Despite a sand storm Friday, attendees at Burning Man continued to participate in the Nevada arts festival.

The 'Burners' were photographed moving their bicycles and walking through the festival grounds while wearing bandanas to cover their faces from the dust by the Associated Press.

One attendee, however, appeared relaxed while sitting underneath a beauty salon chair while a bicyclist rode past trying to escape the dust in a photograph from the wire service.

Similarly, another man at Burning Man was snapped with his arms behind his head while sitting in a beach chair during the storm.

Another snap showed a child on top of a structure that read 'Dust Happens.'

The dust storm enveloped much of the view of the festival on Friday, though the giant burning man figure, along with a Ferris wheel, peeked out in photographs taken by Sasha Maslov.

Attendees were also captured by checking out multiple structures and sites on the festival grounds - including a giant boat in the desert and the so-called 'Temple of Grace' - by Reuters.

On Friday morning, a project almost 12 months in the making called Embrace - a 72-foot wooden sculpture of two people lovingly looking into each other, built across studios in Vancouver and Portland - was reduced to nothing but dust and ash.

The remote week-long rave in the Nevada desert - often described as 'where Mad Max meets Woodstock' - culminates each year with many of the statement artworks going up in flames, in a symbol of catharsis, reflection and new beginnings.

'In short, Embrace is about asking people to consider why death is so challenging and why it’s also so beautiful,' lead artist Matt Schultz said on a website for the sculpture.

Tragically death was an all-too-real element of this year's festival.

Symbolic: Fire is a major part of the festival at Black Rock City in the Nevada desert

Art gallery manager Alicia Louise Cipicchio, 29, was killed after being hit by a party bus near Center Camp early on Thursday.

It is not known whether the Wyoming 
woman was walking at the time or whether she fell off and then underneath 
the bus, which had people dancing on the top deck at the time of the accident.

Later in the day, thousands of the almost 70,000-strong crowd gathered at Embrace to watch as the first of this year's sculptures was burned, taking a moment to remember Cipicchio.

Schultz said on the Embrace website the design of the piece was supposed to be hopeful.

'It’s not all about sorrow. It’s also about appreciating the relationships in your life,' he said.

'I want people to think about people they miss. But I don’t want people to miss out on those moments you share with the ones who are still here. Say “I love you.”

'Enjoy that moment now.'

This year's festival has already been dogged by moments of controversy.

Black Rock Desert was doused in rain in the lead up to the gate's opening on August 25, forcing organizers to turn people away until the grounds had dried and the proper festival infrastructure could be put back together.

Next, hardcore 'Burners' complained the essence of what the festival represented - a society without currency built on sharing and freedom - had been ruined by an influx of tech billionaires that brought with them a five star experience, complete with luxury RV's, top shelf liquor and even bodyguards.
