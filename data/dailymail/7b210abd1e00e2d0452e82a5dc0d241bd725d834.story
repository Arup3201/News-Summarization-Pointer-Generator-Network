Moving video has captured the incredible moment that Alex McKinnon has a life changing breakthrough, standing for the first time after suffering a devastating spinal injury on the footy field.

After 10 months of intense rehabilitation, this is the moment that so many had been desperately hoping for after the 22-year-old was warned he would likely never walk again.

Celebrating with a grin and a fist pump, it's clear that no one is more excited than 22-year-old McKinnon.

The former Newcastle Knights forward was diagnosed a quadriplegic after suffering a catastrophic tackle in Round Three of the 2014 NRL season in a match against Melbourne Storm.

However, he refused to accept the bad news, vowing that he would walk his fiancée Teigan Power down the aisle.

McKinnon's supportive partner has constantly been by his side since his accident, so it was only fitting that she was the one to share in his joy as he stood for the first time.  

The 22-year-old beams with happiness in the video as he stands steadily, his arm around his fiancée's neck for support. 

He strokes her hair affectionately as they relish in the incredible achievement, defying all medical expectations. 

Ms Power wraps her arms around his waist in the video and looks up at him proudly.

The future is bright for the incredible young man, whose positivity and perseverance has been an inspiration for so many Australians, inspiring the #RiseForAlex movement which pledges to offer ongoing and emotional and financial support through his struggles.

He is set to commence a new role with the Knights on January 27, allowing him to be involved with Rugby League again and rejoin his mates at the Newcastle club.

Alex McKinnon commented on his amazing progress through a statement from the Newcastle Knights on Wednesday.

'I remain on the Gold Coast, where I have been for approximately three months as I continue rehabilitation at Making Strides,' McKinnon said.

'I am in the final stages of my current rehabilitation program on the Gold Coast.

'When aided to stand up out of my chair, I am now able to stand for a short amount of time with assistance.

'I am set to return to Newcastle in the coming weeks to commence my new role with the Knights.

'Thank you as always, for the well wishes and encouragement.'

Newcastle Knights coach Rick Stone earlier revealed McKinnon's impressive achievement.

'He's just finished in his rehab and he actually stood up unabated the other day ... he stood up on his own which is a terrific sort of step for Alex,' Stone said.

Stone later clarified his statement, explaining that McKinnon can stand with assistance.  

McKinnon has been determined from the very beginning to make a full recovery and last July the NRL's Rise For Alex round raised ove $1.4 million towards that goal.

Stone said spoke about McKinnon's new position with the club, explaining that his promising career with the NRL will also involve spending one day a week in the commercial area.

'That's going to be a great opportunity for Alex to get his teeth into something he really loves, footy,' he told Sky Sports Radio.

'He's inspiring young men and everyone in the club will be really happy to see him back.'

Ever the optimist, McKinnon proposed to Teagan just days after getting the devastating news that he will never play his beloved game of football ever again. 

McKinnon proudly announced the engagement on Instagram at the time.

'This girl is my soldier, I am truly overwhelmed with the support and wishes from everybody in the rugby league society and the community at large. Your ongoing support will never be forgotten,' he wrote.

'PS. When life throws you struggles respond with a smile. So happy to announce Teigan and my engagement.#throughthickandthin #iwillwalkherdowntheisle.'

The horrendous news rocked the entire NRL community - but no one more than former Knights coach Wayne Bennett.

The normally stoic man, who is now the Brisbane Broncos coach, revealed he lost interest in football in the weeks after one of his players Alex McKinnon suffered a devastating spinal injury that ended his career.

'I was very confused with myself, very confused. I didn't feel as emotional as I thought I should and then it dawned on me that I was living a lie and not letting my emotions come through because I couldn't afford to.

'But I've shed a lot of tears since about him...and I suppose I'll shed some more.

'It's good to get it off my chest.'

Bennett said what he wanted for McKinnon now was for him to be happy.

'I saw a bit of myself [in him] when I was younger,' he said.

'I like his style and how he carried himself and I'm really proud of him.'

Speaking at the launch of the NRL's 'Rise For Alex' round in July last year, it's not entirely surprising that McKinnon has achieved  the impossible when all he could think about was focusing on walking again.

His goal is to resume a normal life as soon as possible - adding that although his recovery was going to be a slow and long process he was prepared to give it his best shot.

'As much as I would love to get home and get back to my family and get back to Newcastle and get on with my life, I want to walk again,' he said.

'You see a lot of stories about people who get on with their lives and don't walk again. My focus is to get as much back of my movement as I can and I am slowly improving.

'For example, when I first got diagnosed I was a C4 - all that is shoulder movement. Nothing else. No fingers, no movement in your legs, or anything like that.

'I am slowly progressing with the movement, I am a C7 now.'
