Former Arsenal striker Alan Smith would love to see Danny Welbeck at the Emirates and insists Arsene Wenger can transform him into a 'top player'.

Welbeck has fallen out of favour at Manchester United under Louis van Gaal, and is expected to leave the club before the transfer window closes on Monday night.

Smith believes he could be the solution to Wenger's striker shortage, tellingskysports.com: 'I think he would make an excellent signing for somebody. He's had unfair criticism over the last couple of years really, he's been playing out of position at United and shunted around the park.

'Yes, his finishing hasn't been up to scratch at times but that comes from not playing in your regular position. I think if he was given an extended spell through the middle, where he likes it, you would see a really top player develop. I would love to see him at Arsenal.' 

Giroud's injury looks set to rule him out until the new year, and Wenger may still decide to add to his squad.

When asked to compare Giroud and Welbeck, Smith was quick to point out the difference in styles between the two players. 

'Danny Welbeck's got most attributes. Olivier Giroud is a very good target man and is a very good header of the ball, and he'll get you 20+ goals, so that's not to be sniffed at, but Danny is different. He's very good technically as he's shown with England and he is a bit quicker.'
