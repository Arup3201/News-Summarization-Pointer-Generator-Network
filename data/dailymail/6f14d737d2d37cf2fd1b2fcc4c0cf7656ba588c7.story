It seems couples who gym together stay together – at least if you take the advice of these superfit grandparents.

Bobby and Irene Simpson, who celebrated their 80th birthdays last month, have been going to the gym twice a week for 15 years.

The couple live in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire and have been married for 58 years after falling in love at a cycling club aged 16.

Staying fit: Bobby and Irene Simpson, both 80, have been regulars at the gym for 15 years

Bobby and Irene also go for a six-mile hike every Sunday, no matter the weather, and despite their old 
age they have no intention of stopping.

On top of their shared exercise regime, Bobby still finds the energy to play two full rounds of golf each week.

Irene, who was at the gym for a two-hour workout today, said their age surprises people.

‘There are a few pensioners that regularly attend the gym but I don’t think any of them are quite our age.

‘We get out and get to know people we would never meet sitting around watching the television.

‘Staying
active is very important. We live at the top of a flight of stairs 
which we can both still manage, though I don’t run up them any more.

Fe-row-cious workout: Twice a week the couple get an early start and spend two hours at the gym doing cardio, weight lifting and rowing

Bobby met Irene as a member of the National Clarion Cycling Club in the late 1940s.

Two years later the teenager was sent off on national service but upon his return in 1954 the couple got married.

They had daughter Irene Wallace, now 53, and have two grandchildren.

Bobby worked as a painter and decorator and then as a construction equipment assembly worker while Irene worked as a cleaner.

When she retired 25 years ago, restlessness led to her joining the nearby gym and when Bobby retired ten years later he joined her.

For the past five years they have been attending DW Fitness in Coatbridge and at 7am every Monday and Friday the couple head to the leisure centre.

Bobby and Irene’s rigorous work-out includes up to four miles on the treadmill, half an hour on the rowing machine, up to an hour lifting weights and 15 minutes on an exercise bike.

Irene finishes her workout on the inflatable medicine ball and the pair head off for a well-earned rest in the steam and sauna rooms.

Irene said: ‘Bobby was in the men’s racing team when I first met him.

‘I was in the women’s touring team but we still saw each other now and again, he was very dashing.

‘We had to stop cycling when we began to work and had a family but I started again when I retired.

‘We go in at 7am and work out for over two hours. I went four times a week up until a couple of years ago.

‘We like to keep fit. It gets you out and I look forward to it. There is a group of us that have moved around various gyms throughout the years so we know lots of people.’

Every Sunday the couple set out from their Coatbridge home for a three-mile walk to nearby Airdrie across the town’s park, no matter the weather.

Irene said: 'When it snowed a couple of years ago we didn’t see a soul. It was just us in the park surrounded by blankets of white snow, it was beautiful.'

Bobby said: ‘We carry out that walk without fail every Sunday. It doesn’t matter what the weather is like.

‘We change our routine every now and again to keep it interesting but we keep going. At our age it’s important to keep fit but we have always been active.’

Healthy love: Bobby and Irene met in the early forties at a local cycling club and married in 1954
