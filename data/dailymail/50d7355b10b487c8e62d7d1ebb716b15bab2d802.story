The fire that ravaged a Tesla Model S electric car earlier this week began in the vehicle's battery compartment, it has been revealed, after the driver hit a large piece of metal debris.

When pictures of the blaze first surfaced on the internet, the California-based car maker's stock dropped. By the end of trading, it had fallen a total of six per cent, closing at $180.95 (£111.55) - down by $12.05 (£7.43). 

In an incident report, released under 
Washington state's public records law, officials wrote they 
thought the fire had started in the car's battery compartment.

Shares of Tesla Motors fell more than six per cent on Wednesday after an online video showed one of the firm's electric Model S vehicles on fire in Seattle, pictured. Despite appearing to have the fire under control, firefighters wrote in an official report the flames reignite meaning they had to use a dry chemical extinguisher

In August this year, the Tesla Model S was awarded a five-star safety rating by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) - not just overall, but in every subcategory.

Approximately one percent of all cars tested by the federal government achieve five stars across the board.

NHTSA does not publish a star rating above five, however safety levels better than five stars are captured in the overall Vehicle Safety Score (VSS) provided to manufacturers.

In this guide, the Model S was shown as having a combined score of 5.4 stars - one of the highest ever recorded. 

It also set a new record for the 'lowest likelihood of injury to occupants.'

However, it was actually caused by the driver hitting a large piece of metal debris, which damaged the battery part of the car - and was not due to a fault.

The Model S has previously been touted as 
the safest car in America and it received among the highest scores ever 
recorded from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
in August.

Despite appearing to have the fire under control, firefighters wrote in the report that the flames reignited and water intensified the burning, meaning they had to use a dry chemical extinguisher.

The liquid-cooled 85 kilowatt-hour 
battery in the Tesla Model S is fitted below the car on the passenger side of the vehicle. It uses lithium-ion similar to the batteries in laptops and phones.

Investors and companies have previously voiced concerns about the fire risk of such batteries after issues were reported in recent years involving the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid car 
and Boeing's 787 plane.

Company spokeswoman Liz Jarvis-Shean said the fire Tuesday was caused by the crash after a large metallic object was thought to have hit one of the battery pack's modules in the Model S.

'A Model S collided with a large metallic object in the middle of the road, causing significant damage to the vehicle,' the company said in a statement.

'The car’s alert system signalled a problem and instructed the driver to pull over safely, which he did. No-one was injured, and the sole occupant had sufficient time to exit the vehicle safely and call the authorities.

Shares of Tesla have risen more than 400 per cent this year, but they fell $12.05 (£7.43) to $180.95 (£111.55) on Wednesday, chart pictured. R.W. Baird analyst Ben Kallo also cut his rating on the motoring firm's stock from 'Outperform' to 'Neutral', which may have affected its price

In an incident report, officials wrote they thought the fire, pictured, started in the car's battery compartment

'Subsequently, a fire caused by the substantial damage sustained during the collision was contained to the front of the vehicle thanks to the design and construction of the vehicle and battery pack.

'All indications are that the fire never entered the interior cabin of the car. It was extinguished on-site by the fire department.'

After dismantling the front end of the vehicle and puncturing holes in the battery pack, the fire crew used a circular saw to cut an access hole in the front section to apply water to the battery, according to documents.

The incident happened as the Tesla's driver was traveling southbound on state Route 167 through the Seattle suburb of Kent, said Trooper Chris Webb of the Washington State Patrol.

The driver believed he had struck some metal debris on the freeway so exited the highway, where the vehicle broke down. The driver told authorities he began to smell something burning and then the vehicle caught fire.

Firefighters arrived within three minutes of the first call, and although it's not clear from the records how long the fire lasted, crews were said to have remained on scene for two and a half hours. 

Tesla's battery system and the Model S, pictured, have received rave reviews including a top crash-test score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It also achieved one of the highest auto ratings ever recorded by Consumer Reports magazine

Tesla said the flames were contained to the front of the $70,000 vehicle due to its design and construction. 'This was not a spontaneous event,' Jarvis-Shean said. 'Every indication we have at this point is that the fire was a result of the collision and the damage sustained through that.'

There was too much damage from the fire to see what damage debris may have caused, Webb added.

The motoring website Jalopnik posted photos of the blaze claiming they were taken by a reader, along with a video.

Shares of Tesla have risen more than 400 per cent this year, but it is thought some investors may have been alarmed by the fire. Tesla shares fell $12.05 (£7.43) to $180.95 (£111.55) on Wednesday.

Also contributing to the stock's 
decline was an analyst downgrade; R.W. Baird analyst Ben Kallo cut 
his rating on the stock from 'Outperform' to 'Neutral'.

He is reported to have told investors that while he's still 'bullish' on Tesla's long-term prospects, 
the company has 'significant milestones' during the next 18 months that 
come with risk.

Tesla said the flames in the Seattle fire were contained to the front of the vehicle, a press shot of the car is pictured, due to its 'design and construction.' 'This was not a spontaneous event,' spokeswoman Jarvis-Shean said. 'Every indication is that the fire was a result of the collision'

The 
company's battery system and the Model S have received rave 
reviews, including a top crash-test score from the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration. It also received one of the highest auto ratings ever
recorded by Consumer Reports magazine.

Yet lithium-ion batteries have raised concerns in other vehicles.

Two years ago, battery fires broke out in three Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid cars after crash-testing, but NHTSA investigators determined that the Volt was no more risky than vehicles with conventional gasoline engines.

Officials from General Motors, and the government, believed the fires were caused by coolant leaking from damaged plastic casing around the batteries after side-impact test crashes. At the time, they said there were no real-world fires in any Volts.

Earlier this year, Boeing's worldwide fleet of 787s was grounded because lithium-ion batteries overheated or caught fire. Flights resumed four months later after a revamped battery system was installed.
