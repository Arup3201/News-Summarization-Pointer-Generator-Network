Bangladeshis packed into - and onto - trains in the capital Dhaka tonight as they raced home to break their last fast of Ramadan.

The annual Muslim fasting period has come to an end and these commuters were trying to get home as quickly as possible to prepare for the festival of Eid al-Fitr, which begins tomorrow.

For the past month observant Muslims across the world have refrained from eating or drinking anything from dawn to sunset in a show of spiritual devotion.

Party time: Tonight is the start of a three-day national holiday in Bangladesh, where people will take time to visit friends and family as well as attend mass religious gatherings

Room for one more? For the past month observant Muslims across the world have refrained from eating or drinking anything from dawn to sunset in a show of spiritual devotion, but that ends tonight

Time to eat... lots: Eid is a particularly special time for children, who are often given presents

But tonight, after the sun sets, they will start tucking into feasts which, in Bangladesh at least, mark the beginning of a three-day national holiday.

In the morning, many will attend mass prayer gatherings called Zakat ul Fitr - with those taking place outside Dhaka reputed to be the biggest anywhere in Asia - before visiting friends and family to enjoy private celebrations.

They will greet each other with the traditional Muslim greeting of Eid Mubarak, which translates roughly as 'Eid blessings' and is more or less equivalent to 'Merry Christmas'.

As well as the special prayers and celebrations, customs of Eid include dressing up in new clothes, eating special delicacies, giving presents and, for women, decoration of the hands with henna.

A U.S. military spokesman says prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay prison will be served traditional holiday meals to mark the end of Ramadan.

Navy Capt. Robert Durand says he expects most of the 166 prisoners at the U.S. base in Cuba will take part in the prayers and meals for the holiday known as Eid al Fitr.

It's not known whether a long-running hunger strike will surge again.

The U.S. says 55 prisoners still met the criteria to be classified as hunger strikers as of Wednesday even though most have been eating at least once a day.

The number dropped by half since the start of Ramadan in July.

Lawyers for prisoners say some likely gave up the strike because of Ramadan or were just worn out by the protest.

Jack Khan, a British-Bangladeshi Muslim, told MailOnline that some of the special dishes being passed round Eid tables may include shemai, a sweet made with vermicelli and milk, and fita, fried dough balls made with rice flour and drizzled with ghee - which he described as 'delicious'.

For those who can afford it in Bangladesh, there would also be lots of different types of roasted meat on offer, served with that perennial favourite, pilau rice.

Many will be feeling a sense of relief at the end of Ramadan, a month of fasting during which observant Muslims are encouraged not to eat or drink anything - even water - during the hours of daylight.

A time of spiritual reflection and increased worship, during the period Muslims are expected to pay more attention to the teachings of their religion, also refraining from sexual relations with their spouses as well as generally sinful behaviour.

It is believed to help teach devotees how to better practice self-discipline and sacrifice, but also inculcate empathy for those less fortunate than themselves and encourage generosity and charity.

Charity is also an important part of Eid. Mr Khan explained: 'I have to give a minimum of £5 per person in my family - which is the equivalent of a bag of rice.

'This time of year, because it's the New Year, a lot of people also give their Zakāt, which is 2.5 per cent of your wealth, irrelevant of much you earn.

'So my wife has to give 2.5 per cent of the value of all her jewellery, which she can either do by selling some of it... or I can pay for it.

'If you watch the Muslim TV channels you would have seen there has been a massive amount of fundraising going on over the past month.'
