Lee Halcrow, 38, admitted vehicle interference at court after he tried to steal a car but was knocked out by its owner

A thief with 116 previous convictions has appeared in court today after he was knocked out by the owner of the car he was trying to steal.

Lee Halcrow was hit unconscious by the owner when he spotted the interior light of his car switch on when it was parked outside his house. 

When the owner and his brother went out 
to challenge him, Halcrow, 38, ran off but was eventually caught by 
the pair, who knocked him unconscious and called the police.

Halcrow pleaded guilty to vehicle interference when he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court.

It is the latest in a string of convictions
for the former drug addict that go back to 1989.

He has more than 
60 theft-related offences and numerous counts of drunk and disorderly 
and drug-related crimes.

John McGlone, prosecuting, told the court that the owners of the car were in their home with the husband's brother and his wife when they saw the inside light of the car turn on.

He said: 'The men went outside and asked what he was doing.

'Halcrow said someone had told him to get it and ran off towards Chichester Road.

'They caught up and detained him while waiting for the police.'

Mr McGlone told the court that Halcrow was hospitalised for three days because of his injuries.

He was arrested after being discharged.

Christopher Brown, defending, said: 'He can’t get away from the fact that he now has 116 convictions.

'He has very little recollection of this at all, because as a result of the pursuit of him he was  hospitalised for three days.

'However, he didn’t cause any damage to the car or steal anything.

'He has moved outside of the area under a resettlement programme, to try and make a positive change in his life.'

Magistrates adjourned the case until Friday for the probation service to prepare a report about Halcrow.

Halcrow pleaded guilty at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court and the case has been adjourned to Friday

He was granted unconditional bail until then.

Halcrow is originally from South Shields but 
has been moved to Stanley in County Durham in an attempt to stop him 
committing crimes.

He was once banned from every store in the shopping area of King Street, South Shields, due 
to his record, and was jailed in 2011 after stealing a 
£15,000 car from outside a pub in the town and selling it for just £150.

In 2002, he became the first person in the borough to be placed on the then-new drug treatment and testing order by magistrates after he admitted stealing 48 selection boxes to fund a heroin habit.

In June 2011, Halcrow was given a daytime curfew for six weeks and banned from South Shields Asda as well as every shop in King Street after stealing a laptop from Currys.
