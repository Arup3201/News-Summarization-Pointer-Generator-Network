Amateur radio - also called ham radio - operators were dealt a treat this weekend, when Russians aboard the ISS communicated with Earthlings.

And one first-time enthusiast received a welcome surprise when, using a USB dongle and other equipment, he was able to receive the transmissions from the cosmonauts orbiting Earth.

By analysing the bits of data they sent, he was able to piece together images and sounds from the space station that commemorated moments in Russia and the Soviet Union’s space history.

A ham radio operator from Poland has received images from the ISS. On Reddit he revealed his low-cost method to talk to cosmonauts. He used a USB dongle known as an RTL-SDR to receive sounds. When decoded these were revealed to be images of Russian space history (postcard of Yuri Gagarin shown)

The amazing images were posted to Reddit by 22-year-old student Radoslaw Karwacki, from Poland.

'These images are not transmitted regularly. I was really lucky to receive them, because it was my first experience with this kind of equipment,' he told MailOnline.

'I blindly tuned in on that frequency during ISS flyby and happened to receive the signal.' 

Astronauts and cosmonauts on the station regularly communicate with people back on Earth using ham radio.

Indeed, anyone with a radio licence and the right equipment can transmit to the crew and talk to them. A licence is not required to listen in, however.

Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998.

It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three.

The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km).

It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house.

It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour.

It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. 

Over the weekend, the Russians decided to use a picture transmission method known as slow-scan television (SSTV) to relay images to Earth.

In this instance the images included several of Yuri Gagarin, who became the first human in space on 12 April 1961 - and was born more than 80 years ago on 9 March 1934.

Gagarin is seen in his spacesuit preparing for launch, while the rocket that took him to space - an evolution of which is still in operation today - was also transmitted with the images. 

'I think it's a great way to commemorate the first person that went to space,' Mr Karwacki added.

'Having an international crew on the station all the time is something to really think about and appreciate.

'It shows that our civilisation can cooperate to achieve great things, and I'm sure that is something that will grow.

'And it's great that they still remember about their roots.'

By listening to the transmitted sound broadcast on voice frequencies, receivers were able to decode the incoming messages and see the pictures the cosmonauts on the ISS decided to send.

‘Images are transmitted using the Slow Scan Television (SSTV) protocol,’ Mr Karwacki explained on imgur, where he posted the images.

‘Before the picture transmission started, I could hear an astronaut voice - "This is Romeo Sierra Zero India Sierra Sierra" - which is RS0ISS in the Nato phonetic alplabet.

RS0ISS is the Russian callsign from the station, while the Americans used the callsign NA1SS when they communicate with ham operators.

To receive the images and sounds, Mr Karwacki said he used an RTL-SDR USB dongle (shown), an antenna, the SDRSharp programme to receive the data and MMSTV software to decode it

To receive the images and sounds, Mr Karwacki said he used an RTL-SDR dongle, an antenna, the SDRSharp programme to receive the data and MMSTV software to decode it.

The software is available free online, while such a dongle costs around £10 ($15). 

According to the website ISS Fan Club, the transmissions took place on Saturday 31 January and Sunday 1 February.

In total 12 images were sent by the Russian ISS crew.

To make contact, line-of-sight with the station is required, so ham radio operators  tune in when the ISS is flying over their location.

ISS crew members often make unscheduled calls back to Earth with ham radios when they have a spare moment.

And by picking up a few bits of equipment you, too, could listen and talk with the astronauts and cosmonauts on the station.
