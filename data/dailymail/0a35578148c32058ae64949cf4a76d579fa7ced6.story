A Navy recruiter has shot two soldiers near a Tennessee navy base after reportedly being fired.

The gunman allegedly shot one soldier in the foot and another in the leg at the National Guard Armory in Millington following an altercation just after 12.30pm on Thursday.

Both of the injured soldiers were taken to the Regional Medical Center in Memphis, where they remain in non-critical condition.

The shooter, whose identity has not been released, was reportedly apprehended by National Guardsmen at the scene before police arrived. He was then taken into police custody.

The gunman refused transport to the hospital, suggesting his own injuries were not that serious.

Local reports said he had been relieved of duty today and returned to the site with a handgun.

Photos sent to the local stations showed police crime-scene tape and several medics on site.

Witnesses said they saw the injured men in uniform and covered with blood, while others said police apprehended a white male, who was also in uniform.

As the first reports of the shooting began to emerge, the U.S. Navy had tweeted: '#BREAKING: #USNavy can confirm incident near Naval Support Activity Midsouth in #Millington.'

Preliminary reports had suggested that the shooting took place within the facility, but the Navy has now acknowledged that the shooting occurred at an armory on naval property.

WMC-TV said the incident occurred in a 
'non-secured' area near the Naval Support Activity Mid-South base, close
to Tennesseeâ€™s border with Arkansas and Mississippi.

The base was initially under lockdown but this has now been lifted.

Naval Support Activity Midsouth is a human resources center for the U.S. Navy. More than 7,500 military, civilian and contract personnel work there, according to its Facebook page.

Millington is about 20 miles northeast of Memphis.

The shooting on Thursday comes about a month after 13 people were killed in the attack at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.
