Liverpool's first team stars got back down to business following news of Steven Gerrard's decision to leave Anfield at the end of the season by stepping up their preparations for their FA Cup clash against AFC Wimbledon.

Reds manager Brendan Rodgers put his side through their paces ahead of Monday night's encounter at Kingsmeadow.

Jordan Henderson revealed on Friday that his side were 'shocked' by Gerrard's decision to end his affiliation with the club, however the focus at the Merseyside outfit has now shifted to their upcoming fixture.

Henderson, who has been tipped to replace Gerrard as captain, and his Liverpool team-mates will be hoping they can bounce back from their disappointing 2-2 draw with Leicester.

Rodgers said in the build up to their FA Cup tie against the League Two outfit that he had spoken to Gerrard for 'quite a while' before his announcement was made public.

'I've been in conversations for quite a while with Steven and had an idea of his feelings moving forward,' said Rodgers.

'He had always been really respectful in terms of once he made his final decision, he wanted me to know first. In fairness to him, we had a chat a few days before the announcement was made.

'I've been fully aware all the way along. He is someone who deserves the utmost respect and that's why I said in the last press conference when we were talking that [because of] what the guy has done in the game and how he is as a person, he deserves the time to make his decision.'

Rodgers added that he will not include Gerrard in his starting line-up for sentimental reasons despite knowing the 34-year-old is edging closer to his final appearance in a Reds shirt.

He added: 'I'll always pick what I think is the best team for the games.

'Every football player is the same - they want to play every minute of every game, and Steven is no different.'

Mario Balotelli will be hoping to return to action on Monday after being left out of Liverpool's squad to face Leicester on New Year's Day.
