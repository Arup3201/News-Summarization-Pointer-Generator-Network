IT was the second most highly-anticipated birth of the year.

But Britain will have to wait for its first baby panda after it emerged that Tian Tian has lost her much longed-for cub.

After weeks of high hopes for an historic captivity-bred newborn, Edinburgh Zoo yesterday announced that the animal – also known as Sweetie – had lost the baby late in the pregnancy.

Tian Tian, Britain's only female giant panda, is believed to have lost her cub

Experts noted signs in August that the artifical insemination in April had been successful and a panda cub had been expected for last month

Professor Chris West, chief executive 
of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: ‘Everyone is saddened
 by this turn of events after so many weeks of waiting.’

Despite the disappointment, the zoo has vowed to try again with a breeding programme and said it is ‘confident’ of success.

Professor
 West added: ‘The majority of research centres and zoos with giant 
pandas around the world have not successfully bred until their third or 
fourth year and what we have achieved considering we have had giant 
pandas for less than two years is immense.

‘New
 hormone research is beginning to indicate that lost pregnancies are 
more common in giant pandas than first thought, though at the moment no 
one knows why.’

The panda's carers at Edinburgh Zoo had been kept guessing whether Tian Tian was pregnant after she was artificially inseminated in April

Britain’s only female giant panda arrived from China in 2011 in a £6million loan along with a male, Yang Guang.

From the off, it was hoped the pair would be the first giant pandas to breed in Britain during their ten-year stay.

Pandas find it difficult to conceive because females become fertile just once a year for 36 hours between mid-April and May.

Attempts at getting a pair to mate, meanwhile, can often prove fruitless.

Even where they are successful, fertilized eggs remain suspended within the panda until an unknown trigger causes it to implant.

It is then difficult to determine whether they are pregnant because they do not develop a 'baby bump'.

The bears also commonly have phantom pregnancies - Tian Tian had one last year.

Tian Tian then kept everyone guessing over a possible pregnancy when she was artificially inseminated in April.

A public already gripped by the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy was given regular updates on the ten-year-old.

In
 August, the zoo delivered the news that Tian Tian could just be a 
fortnight away from giving birth – and twins were a possibility.

Hormone
 and protein tests and the production of breast milk ‘seemed to suggest’
 she was expecting and the zoo went into panda cub overdrive – putting 
two incubators on standby, beaming CCTV footage of the panda enclosure 
into staff homes and flying in a panda birth expert from China.

But
 over the last few days she has returned to non-pregnancy eating and 
behavioural patterns, leading experts to believe she had lost the baby.

Officials are not sure exactly what went wrong but believe she 
‘re-absorbed’ the tiny foetus, which would have been smaller than half a
 block of butter, back into her body.

Iain
 Valentine, director of the zoo’s panda project, said: ‘Why does this 
happen? We don’t truly understand, but what we do know is this is a 
species which lives on the edge of a balance between nutritional uptake 
and reproducing.

‘If things 
aren’t quite right this can be a reason why they absorb the young and 
cancel the pregnancy. We are determined to learn from this.’
