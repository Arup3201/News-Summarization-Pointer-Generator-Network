Avid fans of the Doctor have been blamed for causing a stampede for online tickets to the Proms - prompting the system to crash and touts to sell them for more than ten times their original value.

The Doctor Who Proms will return for the show's 50th anniversary - and prompted a rush to snap up tickets to the two exclusive performances.

The huge demand for tickets - and subsequent crash of the official website - was criticised as 'atrocious organisation'.

Sell out! The stampede for tickets meant many were left disappointed as they could not get tickets online or on the phone

More than 100,000 tickets sold online, while the rest were bought over the phone, by post or in person from London's Royal Albert Hall

Visitors were greeted with error messages and hopeful attendees complained of spending four hours trying to get tickets to various shows.

Hopeful attendees were left disappointed when their attempts to purchase tickets were abruptly terminated online, or kept for hours on the telephone.

Some tickets were already being sold by touts before the weekend was out, with tickets for the much-anticipated Last Night of The Proms advertised for £1,250 - when tickets should have cost between £27 and £95, The Daily Telegraph reported.

One customer told the Daily Telegraph he would formally complain after spending two hours online and on the telephone, but continuously met 'error' messages

A record 114,000 tickets for the BBC Proms 2013 have sold since booking opened on Saturday, a 17 per cent rise from last year.

More than 100,000 tickets were sold online, while the rest were bought over the phone, by post or in person from London's Royal Albert Hall.

The Proms is the UK's premier classical music festival - and ticket sales have seen a 17 per cent rise from last year

Dr Who fans have been blamed as crashing the website as they clamoured for tickets

Fans had hoped to hear Murray Gold's music from the past eight years, early Doctor Who compositions and the work of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.

But despite the attacks, BBC Proms director Roger Wright described the 'record-breaking' sales as a 'thrill', the BBC reported.

Wright, who is controller of Radio 3, urged people to continue looking.

He added that there were still tickets available for the 'vast majority of events' and that 'you can always come and Prom on the day'.

The 2013 programme has revealed a diverse programme - featuring rap and punk amid the Elgar and Wagner.

The revelation led to the corporation being accused of dumbing down the eight-week festival.

The inclusion of rap for the first time is an attempt to attract a younger audience.

The Urban Classic Prom includes rappers Maverick Sabre and Fazer, as well as soul singer Laura Mvula, interspersed with pieces by modernist classical composers.

Another of the concerts, a 6 Music Prom put together by the radio station’s Steve Lamacq, includes performances from punk veterans The Stranglers and former Catatonia singer Cerys Matthews.
