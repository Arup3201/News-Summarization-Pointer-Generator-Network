Police in Bossier City, Louisiana are searching for the heartless thief who stole $200 dollars from a woman who had just been injured in a car accident.

On Monday, Shannon Slocum was on her way to pay her rent when she ran into an SUV pulling out of a dentist's office parking lot.

Ms Slocum's Toyota rolled over and landed upside down, knocking her out.

Ms Slocum was released from the hospital Wednesday night and spoke with KSLA, saying she was just 'grateful to be alive.'

Ms Slocum, who works as a waitress and relies on tips to make a living, is hurt by the loss of rent money but more hurt behind the robber's through process.

'It hurts me most that money is more important than life,' she said. 

Complete strangers have stepped up since the accident offering to buy her food in random acts of kindness. 

She hopes that whatever her money is being used for 'it makes them happy' because 'it makes me happy to say I'm still here.' 

Police are still looking for the robber. After reviewing security footage, they believe the man is middle-aged, wearing a denim jacket and 5-foot-10.
