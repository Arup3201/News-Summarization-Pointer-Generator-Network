A newborn baby died of severe brain damage after midwives advised his mother to stay at home when she fell desperately ill during labour, an inquest heard.

Lewis Booton-White died in his mother Vicki's arms shortly after being born at the Serenity Unit in Birmingham's City Hospital last May.

The 24-year-old, from Smethwick, West Midlands, had been vomiting and had unknowingly been bleeding heavily during labour, but was told to stay at home by midwives.

Vicki White's newborn son Lewis passed away in her arms after problems occurred during her labour. She had repeatedly informed midwives she was unwell during her labour but told not to attend Birmingham City Hospital

She had been checked out earlier in the day at City Hospital, but was told everything was fine and sent home, the inquest heard.

However, her worried mother later called midwives as her daughter was in so much pain that she could not get to the phone - but she was still instructed not to return to hospital.

Eventually, her concerned family called an ambulance and she was taken back to the Serenity Birthing Unit, where doctors discovered the unborn baby's heart rate was dropping.

Young Lewis was born a short time later but was not breathing and had no heart rate. After being briefly revived by doctors, he was placed on life support.

Medics warned Ms White that if her son did survive, he would be left seriously brain damaged.

After having Lewis baptised, the devastated mother took the decision to stop his life support and he later died in her arms.

The 24-year-old eventually went by ambulance to Birmingham City Hospital (pictured) but Lewis was not breathing when he was born and had no heart rate. He was placed on a life support machine but later died

At an inquest into his death, HM Coroner Louise Hunt recorded a narrative verdict and said: 'Lewis died from acute hypoxia which occurred during labour because he had a small placenta.'

The hospital has denied that any alleged staff failings contributed to the death.

The hearing was told how Lewis was a small baby and there had been a small placenta but previous scans suggested he was growing within the normal parameters.

During an inquest, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospital Trust told Ms White (above) that there were no failings that could have caused her son's death

Lawyers acting for Ms White claimed a Serious Incident Report carried out by Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospital Trust following the death had highlighted some staff failures.

These allegedly included that the midwife team had poor record keeping and the instructions given to the expectant mother about when to return to the unit were not clear. 

A telephone log should have also been used, it was claimed.

Victoria Blankstone, from Irwin Mitchell lawyers, who represented Ms White at the inquest, said: 'Vicki has been left devastated by the death of her baby boy and for the last 15 months has struggled to come to terms with her loss.

'This is a very difficult time for the family and the inquest has gone some way in providing answers to the questions they had about why Lewis died.'

Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospital Trust offered condolences to Ms White and her family and said an internal investigation had been undertaken with findings provided to the coroner.

'Through this investigation we found that whilst there were some areas that could have been improved, there were no failings that could have caused or contributed to baby Lewis' death,' a spokeswoman said.

'We accept the Coroner's finding that baby Lewis died of acute hypoxia which occurred during labour because of an insufficient placenta.'
