The Swiss Army Knife was originally designed for soldiers who needed to survive in harsh conditions, but different sized blades are of limited use if you are trying to open an iPhone case or upload data onto your laptop.

A Scandinavian company has therefore come up with a modern take on the classic multi-tool which replaces underused 
features such as blades and tweezers with USB memory sticks, liquid 
spray bottles and paper clips.

However, the ‘Uniquely Useful Tool’ is not available to buy - instead its makers Clas Ohlson have provided the blueprints so DIY fans can make it themselves.

The company claims the design is the first crowd-sourced tool and reflects the more improvisational approach to DIY that is popular in the 21st Century.

To decide which elements were included in the tool, the Scandinavian hardware chain asked followers on Facebook and Twitter to suggest ingenious uses for everyday items.

The firm said fans responded in droves 
and it soon became apparent that even the most basic of household items 
were being used in useful alternative ways, and it consequently made 
sense to put them all together in a tool.

In the company’s professional version, the tool's wooden casing is made of Swedish oak with rounded corners to hold the nine selected items, although people’s efforts at home might not look so polished.

According to the blueprint, an elastic band can be fixed and housed to one of the ‘arms’ of the tool as the company said it is ‘inferior only to duct tape in its ability to hold things together and you can also place it around a paint tin to stop brush drips’.

The tool incorporates a penny as a substitute screwdriver (pictured) and a paperclip which is popularly used to hold cash together, temporarily repair the hems of skirts and take micro SIM cards out of phones

The tool also incorporates a rubber thumbnail, a penny as a substitute screwdriver and a paperclip which is popularly used to hold cash together, temporarily repair the hems of skirts and take micro SIM cards out of phones.

A rotating magnet gained its place in the blueprint for the tool for people trying to retrieve metal objects down the side of sofas, as well as a napkin holder and a liquid spray bottle to hold useful substances like washing up liquid WD40 and stain remover.

Similarly to some Swiss Army Knives, the tool includes a bottle opener but it also proves it is a tool for modern men and women by including a USB memory stick that holds 8GB of information.

While the creation of the tool might be a fun project, the hardware store told MailOnline the components come in at just under £26.83 for one device, although some of the components have to be bought in bulk so it could prove as much as £79.99.

The blueprint can be downloaded from its Facebook page.
