Jay Whiston, 17, whose funeral was today after he was stabbed while attending a house party that spiralled out of control

A teenager stabbed to death after a party advertised on Facebook spiralled out of control has been buried in a Cookie Monster coffin.

Jay Whiston, 17, died from a single stab wound to his heart after he attended a party being held by a 15-year-old schoolgirl in an upmarket neighbourhood in Colchester, Essex.

Despite efforts from the girl’s family to keep the revellers closely monitored, the event became overrun with up to 100 gatecrashers after it was leaked onto Facebook.

Jay, a student who lived in nearby Clacton, was stabbed to death in the road just yards away from the house.

Police, who are still hunting for the teenager’s killer, have released five teenagers on bail on suspicion of murder.

More than 300 of Jay’s friends and his heartbroken family attended his funeral today held at Weeley Crematorium.

There were so many mourners at the funeral that they spilled out of the chapel and onto the surrounding grounds where they listened to the emotional service from a loud speaker.

A hush descended over the mourners as a horse-drawn hearse arrived with Jay’s electric blue coloured coffin.

The coffin was adorned with images of the Sesame Street character, the Cookie Monster, who was a favourite of Jay’s when he was growing up.

The teenager even had a tattoo of the character and since his tragic death, many of his friends and family have had the same image inked on their bodies in tribute.

Reverend Alan Wright described how Jay’s family had been living 'hell on earth' in the weeks since the killing of their 'hero'.

He said: 'Jay could not tolerate violence, least of all could be stand and remain aloof when his friends were being bullied.'

Speaking on behalf of Jay’s father, 
Stafford Whiston, he said: 'Jay, you were my inspiration - you would 
have been one of this country’s great entrepreneurs who would have 
helped get the country back on its feet.'

Reverend
Wright said Jay believed those who carried knives were 'cowards' and 
called on society to turn their back on those who carry them.

Jay’s
sister Holly broke down in tears as she read a tribute to her brother 
who had hoped to go on to university to do business studies and dreamed 
one day of having two little girls.

Since
the tragedy Jay’s mum Caroline Shearer, 47, has hit out at Britain’s 
soft justice for allowing knives to become rife on the streets.

She
said: 'I have no forgiveness for those that are allowed to roam and 
terrorise our streets. This sort of thing is what you see on the news 
but parents have got to realise that it can happen to you.

'It doesn’t matter how good your son or daughter is - there is always a bad one around the corner.

'There is no deterrent to stop people carrying knives - until that changes we will continue to lose good people like my son.

'It
isn’t right that parents cannot send their children to a party without 
fearing for their safety due to these knife-wielding thugs. Judges need to be given the powers to give punishment that is equal to the crime.'

It is still not clear what triggered the killing which happened earlier this month on September 9.

Alhough police have looked into the possibility that Jay stepped in to help a friend who was being picked on.

Jay was going into his second year studying A-levels at Frinton Technical College having achieved nine grade As from his 11 GCSEs.

He lived with his mum and step dad Michael Shearer, 57, and family, including foster children at their home in Clacton and was described as 'a loving boy dedicated to his family'.

He was already making plans for university next year and had worked at his dad’s pawn broker business since the age of 13 instead of claiming weekly pocket money.

Five teenage boys from Colchester are currently on bail, on suspicion of Jay’s murder.

Two of the suspects are 18 whilst the remaining three are all 17. They are all due to answer bail next month.
