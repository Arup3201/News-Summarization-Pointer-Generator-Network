Los Angeles' Justin Williams scored 4:36 into overtime after a turnover by Dan Girardi, giving the Kings a home win over the New York Rangers in the opening game of the NHL's Stanley Cup finals. 

Kyle Clifford had a goal and an assist for Los Angeles, and Drew Doughty made up for an early mistake by scoring the tying goal in the second period as the Kings came charging back from yet another early deficit in a postseason full of comebacks. Jonathan Quick made 25 saves as the Kings moved one victory closer to their second Stanley Cup title in three years. 

'It certainly helps that we've done it time and time again,' said Williams, the repeat postseason hero dubbed Mr. Game 7 for his knack for series-deciding goals. 'It's a great result of the hockey game for us, definitely, but we have a lot of things to clean up. Certainly not our best game by any standards, especially ours, but we were able to get it done. That's the most important thing.'

Game 2 is on Saturday in Los Angeles. 

Williams' goal came on what was the Kings' cleanest scoring chance of the night. Left alone in the slot after Girardi's pass from his knees went straight to Mike Richards, Williams put his eighth goal of the postseason past Henrik Lundqvist, who made 40 saves in what was almost a game-winning performance. 

'There's a handful of guys who raise their game this time of year,' Kings defenceman Willie Mitchell said of Williams. 'He's one of them, and we're lucky to have him. ... I want him to be Mr. Game 1, 2, 3 and 4. We need four wins.'

Los Angeles outshot New York 20-3 in the third period, becoming the first team to get 20 shots in a finals period in 16 years. 

The Kings also got a power play with 1:36 left, setting up a wild finish to regulation. Moments after Carl Hagelin was denied by Quick on a short-handed breakaway, Jeff Carter was stopped agonizingly short of a wraparound goal by Lundqvist, sending the Kings to their third straight overtime playoff game.

Benoit Pouliot scored on a breakaway and Hagelin got a short-handed goal in the first period to put New York on top, but the Rangers spent much of the final two periods on their heels. 

'Not quite sure what happened there in the third,' Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said. 'Not sure if it was them being that good, or us stopping moving the puck and skating and going north-south. They definitely took it to us in the third, and they were able to get a bounce on the winning goal and put it in the back of the net.'

The Kings and the Rangers played a combined 41 games in the first three rounds of the playoffs - just one fewer than the maximum - to emerge from the middle of the playoff pack. 

'At this time of the year, you're not tired,' Lundqvist said. 'You're excited to be out there playing. We were looking to get the first win here, but we'll try it again in the next one.'

The series is big news in the nation's two biggest cities. The last time a New York and Los Angeles team clashed in a major league decider was when the Yankees took on the Dodgers in baseball's World Series in 1981.
