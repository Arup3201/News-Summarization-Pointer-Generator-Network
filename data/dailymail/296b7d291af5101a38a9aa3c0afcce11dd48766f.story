A Virginia lawmaker who was jailed over a sex scandal with his 17-year-old receptionist has announced that she has given birth to a baby boy.

Delegate Joseph Morrissey, 57, told The Richmond Times-Dispatch on Sunday that Myrna Pride, now 18, had delivered 'a beautiful, healthy 7 lb. 8 oz. baby boy' in Georgia.

'I was with Myrna and she is absolutely thrilled… I am too!' he told the paper, which added that there was no information on the baby's father.

Morrissey, who was re-elected from behind bars in January, was released from jail last week after completing a sentence for a misdemeanor relating to the sex scandal, which emerged last summer.

To avoid a trial, he had pleaded no contest in December 2014 to contributing to the delinquency of a minor in a sex scandal involving the then-17-year-old girl. The plea allowed him to avoid potentially decades behind bars.

He had been accused of having sex with the teenager in his law offices - where she worked - and of possessing a naked photo of her, which he also sent to a friend.

Their alleged relationship emerged after Pride's sisters and father found a nude photo and sexually explicit messages on her phone. They tracked Morrissey and Pride from a restaurant one night in August 2013, and then called police, who found the teenager inside his home at midnight.

Morrissey, a bachelor who has fathered three children with three different women, has denied having sex with the teenager. She has also denied the relationship.

Morrissey claimed that Pride came to his home that night in August 2013 not to have sex, but to get his legal help recovering child support from her father, Coleman Pride. 

Then earlier this year, he was indicted on four new felony charges for allegedly forging a document relating to payments Pride's father owed her. Morrissey allegedly vouched for the document in court and persuaded the girl's mother to swear to its authenticity as well.

The document had been presented in court to support his version of events from the night the girl was found inside his home. 

It appeared to be a court order showing that Coleman Pride, Myrna's father, had agreed to pay $50 a month into a college fund for his daughter. But prosecutors said there is no court record of any child support order, and that the document 'appears to be a fabrication'.

Myrna's mother, Deidre Warren, was also indicted on perjury and forgery charges.

Morrissey faces up to 10 years on each count if convicted.

He is preparing for a trial on the charges and Pride, who will turn 19 later this month, has appeared at his recent hearings, the Times-Dispatch reported. 

Morrissey, an attorney known as 'Fighting Joe' since his 1993 courthouse fistfight with another lawyer, said earlier this year that the charges are false and he vowed to beat them.

'This is a very harmful and mean-spirited blow, but I'll do what I've always done. I'll prevail,' he said.  

After his conviction, the four-term Democrat announced his resignation under pressure from his colleagues but angered them by running as an independent in the special election called to choose his successor. He won the election in January. 

That month, the Associated Press reported that his colleagues largely ignore him.

House Speaker William J. Howell stripped Morrissey of his committee assignments, and legislative leaders from both parties are debating whether to censure or expel him.

'This is a truly painful and embarrassing chapter for the oldest continuously operating legislative body in the New World,' Howell said after learning of the new charges. 'The House will evaluate these new indictments as it pertains to disciplinary action.'
