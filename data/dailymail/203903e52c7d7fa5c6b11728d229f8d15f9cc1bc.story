At the Buddhist monastery in Darjeeling, the ancient Tibetan monk lit a fragrant stick and sprinkled herbs into a phial of holy water. His rumbling mantra sounded like a stream running over a bed of pebbles.

'Drink,' said Naresh, our Nepalese guide. The priest poured liquid into my cupped palms. I swallowed the brackish concoction and grimaced.

'He says there is too much going on in your head.' He was right. My head had been spinning and after a week of no sleep and rampaging blood pressure, my friend Ana persuaded me to seek holy help. The problem, I thought, was to do with high altitude and a lack of wine with dinner.

But I left the Druk monastery with a spring in my stride and marched up the steep slope to Chowrasta Square to see the chemist. It was the first time I hadn't had to stop and catch my breath.

'I can't believe this,' he said, as he put his stethoscope away and handed me a handwritten bill for 23p. 'Last night your blood pressure was 160 over 130, now it's normal.' Little surprise, perhaps, in an area famous for levitating Tibetan magi.

I strode up the Nehru road to the Mahakal Hindu temple at the top of Observatory Hill, past the beggars and monkeys, the prayer bells and flags. Below me, the verdant Himalayan foothills.

Back at the verandah of the Elgin hotel, we watched the sun slide slowly behind the ridge of Ghoom. Then the clouds parted to reveal the snowcapped summit of Kanchenjunga. 

Tea time: A picker at work in the fields

The world's third-highest mountain was bathed in golden light as Sanjit the waiter arrived with a chilled bottle of Kingfisher. I was, at last, at one with this strange new world. 

The great tea town of Darjeeling is perched 7,000 ft up in the Indian sector of the Himalayan foothills and still has splendid remnants of the last days of the Raj.

The Elgin was built in 1887 as a summer retreat for the Maharaja of Cooch Behar and is a living celebration of a bygone era, when Darjeeling was Queen of the Hill Stations. Here the top brass from British India retreated en masse during the summer from Calcutta.

It still oozes Edwardian opulence. More than can be said for the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, which grinds its way up and down to Kurseong (and all the way to the plains of Siliguri, once the line is fixed).

We went up to Ghoom, to the railway museum and the Choling monastery, where we spun the prayer wheels, passing within feet of rickety stalls selling fish, meat, mangoes and vegetables.

The 2ft-guage 'toy train' is a World Heritage choo-choo and has been wheezing its way from the plains into the foothills, to its 7,500-ft high point, since 1881. From its carriages you get a glimpse into local life, as it weaves between beasts, shacks and people.

At Darjeeling's Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, I couldn't resist touching the Union flag planted by Sir Edmund Hillary on the summit of Everest 61 years ago.

You can see the kit they wore — Sherpa Tenzing's crampons look like medieval torture implements. It is a moving celebration of man's insuperable instinct to conquer. 

Bygone era: The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway grinds its way  down to Kurseong

The potholed roads here require a local driver and short journeys can take a long time. One of the high points was a 30-mile drive to Kalimpong, on the Silk Route between India and China.

Lover's Point commands views into Sikkim and Western Bengal, across the valley where the rivers Teesta and Rangit join before flowing into the Ganges.

Tea is, of course, the main business and we visited Happy Valley, suppliers to Harrods, and the Tukvar Tea Estate, where 1,500 women pluck the delicate leaves and stamens to make the white, black, green and oolong teas that command high prices around the world. The finest grow above 4,000 feet.

No trip to the hill stations would be complete without at least one night in the old capital of Calcutta.

The driver dropped us in front of Mother Teresa's house, where the Missionaries of Charity carry out their work. Nearby is the Marble Palace, a treasure trove of Western art boasting Rubens, Reynolds, Titian, Murillo and a 10ft statue of Queen Victoria.

We retreated to the air-conditioned splendour of the Taj Bengal hotel, where a tea wallah served up another wonderful brew.

'I have fallen in love,' said Ana. I knew exactly what she meant.
