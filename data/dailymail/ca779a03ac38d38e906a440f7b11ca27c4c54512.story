It's the age-old debate that has split Beatles fans straight down the line for decades. And now celebrities are weighing in on the question: John Lennon or Paul McCartney?

A 34-minute video recorded over a decade shows the responses of 550 celebrities to the simple question, which they told they were only allowed to answer with one word.

Among the famous faces responding were the likes of Robert De Niro, Sylvester Stallone, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch.

John Lennon or Paul McCartney? Some 550 celebrities weigh in on the age-old Beatles question

Even youngsters Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez and Carly Rae Jepson weighed in on the question.

Predictably, there were fans of both Beatles, although some artists veered off course to answer Harrison - and one artist even said 'neither' before offering 'Hendrix'.

The description that accompanied the video read: 'Some stuck to one, some said more, some answered quickly, some thought it through, and some didn't answer at all.'

Those who take the time to watch or listen to the video will learn that Robert De Niro prefers John Lennon, Katy Perry Loves McCartney, and Lady Gaga is 'a Lennon girl'.

The celebrities are organized alphabetically by first name, and each appears for just a few seconds - just long enough to answer the question - before the video moves on.

The video is the brainchild of film, TV and web series production company called Scared Goose Productions run by Matt Schichter in Los Angeles.
