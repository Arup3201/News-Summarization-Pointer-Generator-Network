‘You have seen a little glimpse of the future and that is what this club is about,’ said an emotional Ryan Giggs after watching 18-year-old James Wilson live up to the finest traditions of Manchester United by scoring twice on his debut against Hull City on Tuesday night.

But it’ll be the club’s next manager Louis van Gaal rather than Giggs who has the ultimate responsibility to ensure the Class of ’14 – Wilson, Tom Lawrence, Adnan Januzaj and others – become the future legends of Old Trafford.

It’s been United’s way since the days of Matt Busby to trust young players. Sir Alex Ferguson thought David Moyes would be a good custodian of the tradition, but he was wrong.

History: United have always brought academy players, like Wilson, into their first team

New blood: Youngster James Wilson (second from left) volleys home his first goal for Manchester United

Graduates: (From left to right) Paul Scholes, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs all came through at United

Values: Louis van Gaal has a record of bringing through young talent at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich

Despite his reputation, Van Gaal may actually be a better fit for Wilson and the other teenagers picked by Giggs in his last home game as interim manager.

Scratch beneath the surface with Van Gaal – he's renowned for being arrogant, demanding and a disciplinarian – and you’ll find a very impressive track record in developing young players.

Some would point out that Ferguson’s decision to throw in the kids at Manchester United in 1995 – David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes – came only a few months after Van Gaal had won the Champions League with an Ajax team packed with youth; Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Marc Overmars, Patrick Kluivert and Kanu among them.

It was 18-year-old Kluivert who scored the winning goal against an AC Milan team previously regarded as invincible in the final.

Andreas Pereira

Attacking midfield, Age: 18

Real flair player, very skilful. Signed from PSV Eindhoven and has an eye for scoring spectacular goals such as the one against Liverpool in the Premier League U21 semi final last weekend. Belgian -born but qualifies for Brazil also.

Joel Castro Pereira

Goalkeeper, Age: 17

Born in Switzerland but is Portugal U18s number one. Highly-rated goalkeeper joined after a trial and is tipped to carve out a career at the top. Has excellent attitude, is 6ft 3ins tall, a good shot-stopper and not afraid to come for crosses.

Sean Goss

Midfield, Age: 18

Cultured 6ft 3ins tall midfielder who was signed from Exeter City for £100,000. Sprays the ball around very well and always finds time on the ball. Not had opportunities to break into U21s due to amount of midfielders but has excelled in U18s.

Marcus Rashford

Attacking midfield, Age: 16

One of the top talents in the country for his age group; Highly sought after by England's top clubs, is skilful midfielder who is also comfortable playing in the second striker role. Has played above his age group throughout his young career.

Ro-Shaun Williams

Centre-back, Age: 15

Tall for his age at 6ft 2ins, Williams is a dominant centre back but has good feet and is able to bring the ball out of defence with an eye for a pass also. Has made number of appearances for United's U18s and has been capped by his country.

It’s a 
pattern that has emerged throughout the Dutchman’s career. At Barcelona,
 he gave Andres Iniesta his debut at the age of 18. With Bayern, Thomas 
Muller and other young German players got their chance under Van Gaal.

Why?
 First of all, Van Gaal likes attacking football. He spends far more 
time working on that than defence and young players have the pace, 
energy and sense of adventure you need in an attack-minded team.

The way the Ajax side of ’95 dismantled ageing legends like Franco Baresi by playing with a fast, positive tempo marked a seachange in European football. Their average age was only 23 and that included veteran Frank Rijkaard.

Secondly, Van Gaal likes there to be only one voice in decision-making – his own.

Young 
players are more likely to be open to new ideas from the coach. 
Essentially, they want to play and they want to please, and are happy to
 be guided by a figure like Van Gaal. Older professionals may backchat 
or be more resistant. Ferguson may have found the same with United.

At
 United, Van Gaal will find plenty of young players to assess. Not only 
those like Wilson, Januzaj and Lawrence who made such an impression 
against Hull, but others like Nick Powell and Michael Keane who have 
been on loan this season in The Championship. Even Ferguson’s last 
signing Wilfried Zaha, who fell out badly with Moyes, is still only 21.

There is one proviso of course. They have to be good enough.

When the 
name Fergie’s Fledglings was coined, it wasn’t for the Class of ’92 of 
Beckham, Scholes, Neville etc – but for the previous generation; Russell
 Beardsmore, Mark Robins, Lee Martin.

They were given their first-team chances early by Ferguson and helped him win his first trophy, the FA Cup in 1990.

But
 ultimately despite their youth and energy bringing a feelgood factor to
 Old Trafford, Ferguson decided they weren’t good enough for the highest
 level.

It’s
 a sobering thought for the group who may yet become 'Van Gaal’s 
Vanguard'. But they will at least get their chance. As Giggs, microphone
 in hand on Tuesday night, reiterated: ‘This club always gives youth its
 chance.’

Future star: Van Gaal helped Thomas Muller emerge from Bayern Munich's academy and into the first team

Wise words: Van Gaal gives Muller some advice during a Bundesliga clash with Nuremberg in September 2009

Target? Van Gaal is believed to want a reunion with Bayern star Toni Kroos at Old Trafford after helping to develop him at the Allianz Arena

Room for improvement: Wilfried Zaha has been on loan at Cardiff after failing to make an impression under former boss David Moyes

Experience: United youngster Nick Powell (left) has impressed on loan at Championship side Wigan this season

AJAX

He
 made them one of the most remarkable teams of the Champions League 
era. With an average age of just 23, they took the Dutch ideal of Total
 Football to new heights and beat mighty Milan 1-0 to win the 1995 
Champions League.

They also reached the final the following year against
 Juventus which they lost on penalties, making them the team to have 
come closest to retaining Europe’s biggest prize.

Eventually their best 
players were sold on but that young Van Gaal team of ’95 will still go 
down in history as one of the best-ever.

It was: Edwin van der Sar, 
Michael Reiziger, Danny Blind, Frank de Boer, Frank Rijkaard, Clarence 
Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Jari Litmanen, Finidi George, Marc Overmars, 
Ronald de Boer. Subs – Patrick Kluivert, Kanu.

Half the team were aged 
22 or under and Seedorf, Kluivert and Kanu were all teenagers.

BARCELONA

He
 had two spells at the Nou Camp and though his second stint (2002-03) 
was unsuccessful with Barca going through a transitional phase, history 
shows Van Gaal was an important catalyst for the success that followed.

He
 gave 18-year-old Iniesta his debut in the Champions League against 
Bruges, and the youngster gave a performance described in the next day’s
 Catalan press as 'sensational'. He proved to be a good judge, Iniesta 
came to win everything in the game with Barca and scored Spain’s winning
 goal in the 2010 World Cup final.

Carles Puyol and 22-year-old Xavi 
were also regulars in his team. The midfield partnership of Xavi and 
Iniesta came to symbolise the domination of Spanish tiki-taka football 
for a decade.

BAYERN MUNICH

Bayern
 was in chaos when Van Gaal arrived – in civil war after unsuccessful 
spells in charge by Felix Magath, Ottmar Hitzfeld and Jurgen Klinsmann.

Van Gaal did things his way, strong leadership and emphasis on young 
players, introducing 20-year-old Thomas Muller and Holger Badstuber, 19,
 into a team that won the Bundesliga.

Toni Kroos, 20, also forced his 
way into the line-up after serving a spell on loan at Bayer Leverkusen.
