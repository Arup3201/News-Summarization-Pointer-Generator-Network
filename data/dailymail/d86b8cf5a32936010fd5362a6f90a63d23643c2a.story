Santi Cazorla has urged his Arsenal team-mates to forget their 'nightmare' against Anderlecht and finish the Champions League group stage campaign on a high.

The Gunners take on Galatasaray in Istanbul on Tuesday night knowing that they must win to have a chance of finishing top in Group D.

But their chances remain slim as they are also relying on a slip-up by Borussia Dortmund against Anderlecht, who came from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 with Arsenal at the Emirates last month.

And that slip-up looks as if it will end up costing the Gunners in terms of last-16 opposition as they are now likely to finish second in their group.

Cazorla told FourFourTwo: 'The Anderlecht game was a nightmare for us. To be leading them 3-0 and then allowing them to come back from three goals down in your own home is unacceptable.

'It’s something inexplicable that happened to us and we have to get over it, we have to show everyone that we can react well and in the right way, even though it looks like we’ll be second in the group instead of first.

'We know it’s worse because we’re going to have to play opponents who finished first and are at a really high level, like in the last few seasons when we met Bayern Munich. But ultimately, if you want to win the Champions League or have ambitions to win it you have to play the best. 

'We’d obviously prefer to play a weaker rival, but if we end up against a first class opponent then we have to get on with it and try to beat them if we want to achieve something big. Qualifying is the main thing.'

Cazorla will not feature in Tuesday's match with the Spanish midfielder staying at home in England to rest.
