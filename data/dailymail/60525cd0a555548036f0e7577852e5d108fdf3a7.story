June ‘Mama June’ Shannon has revealed for the first time the real father of daughter Pumpkin amid accusations she was fathered by Mark McDaniel, the man who was convicted of molesting Pumpkin's sister, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell.

In a sit down multi-part interview with Entertainment Tonight, which will start Thursday night, the 35-year-old TLC reality star and mother of Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson said Pumpkin's biological father is Michael Anthony Ford, another convicted sex offender who is prison for the sexual exploitation of minors until 2026.

Ford is also the father of Mama June's second eldest daughter, Jessica, 18.

June claimed to have only seen McDaniel twice since he was released from prison in October after serving 10 years for aggravated child molestation of an eight-year-old in 2004, who Anna says is actually her.

Revelations: June ‘Mama June’ Shannon sits down for an interview with Entertainment Tonight's Brooke Anderson following claims she has rekindled a relationship with Mark McDaniel, the man who molested eldest daughter Anna and is thought to be the father of middle daughter Lauryn, AKA Pumpkin

Truth: Mama June claims Michael Anthony Ford (left), a convicted sex offender, is the biological father of both middle daughters Jessica and Lauryn, AKA Pumpkin, and not Mark McDaniel (right), who molested her eldest daughter Anna

June said one meeting she had with McDaniel was coincidental, and the other was to give closure to Pumpkin, who had been raised believing McDaniel was her father.

'Since two months to almost six years, (Pumpkin) knew nobody but (McDaniel),' June explained.

'She was starting to resent Anna and she was starting to ask me questions. 

'I can't answer those questions for Pumpkin.'

June said she lied to her family about who Pumpkin's father really was because Ford had never been around for Jessica. 

She said 12 other people were in the room when she took Pumpkin to see McDaniel.

June, who will also be interviewed by Dr Phil, has spoken out after claims by daughter Anna that Pumpkin - real name Lauryn Thompson - believed McDaniel was her father.

June has maintained her four daughters are from four different men.

The claim means Ford father two of the girls, middle daughters Jessica and Lauryn 'Pumpkin'.

Eldest Anna's father is David Dunn, who was sentenced for stealing a handgun in 1995 and again in 1998 for stealing cigarettes.

The father of the youngest, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo', is Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, who split from wife Mama June earlier this year.

Speaking out: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell spoke to Dr Drew recently about how her sister Pumpkin was raised to believe Mark McDaniel - who Anna says molested her as a child - is her father

Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell caused headlines last week in another interview by revealing what June has now confirmed- that Pumpkin was raised to believe McDaniel was her father. 

'You know, out of all the kids we have, Mama does not know who Pumpkin's dad is. And Pumpkin thinks it's Mark which kind of hurts my feelings, because Mama is making her believe that someone who did that to me is her father,' Anna told Dr Drew on HLN recently.

'Now Pumpkin hates me for it... I don't really care. Me and Pumpkin have never been that close... Now with her cussing me out, [saying ] "screw you" "F you"... I'm just done with it.'

She added that McDaniel, 53, may have originally come back into Mama June's life earlier this year because he wanted to 'surprise' Pumpkin after he got out of prison.

He served 10 years after pleading guilty to child molestation following Anna's claims that he had sexually assaulted her - sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was in bed beside her.

After Anna told her teacher and police about the assaults, her mother refused to believe her, she said.

Denial: Honey Boo Boo and her mother Mama June are seen outside their home last month

'Mama didn't believe me for a while,' she told HLN. 'She would say, '"Why would you do that to me?" And I would say, "Mama, he did it, I can't take the past back".

'He's apologized for what he's done but she won't... I'm hurt now and I was hurt then.'

But Anna added that she is still in touch with her mother and that they are 'working on things'.

Pumpkin, now 14, has repeatedly defended her mother in interviews and on social media, while Mama June herself has insisted that she hasn't seen McDaniel in 10 years.

But photographs appeared to tell a different story.

She has been pictured house hunting with McDaniel, while another image shows them together with Honey Boo Boo. In that image, McDaniel has his hand on the nine-year-old girl's shoulder. 

Together: Images, such as this one, have emerged showing Mama June with McDaniel. In this photograph, they are pictured with Mama June's daughter, nine-year-old Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson

The children's uncle, Uncle Poodle, has also claimed in an interview that he witnessed the young girl sharing a bed with McDaniel and Mama June during a trip to North Carolina in September.

'I'm disgusted with June for not protecting Alana from Mark,' Uncle Poodle - real name Lee Thompson - told the National Enquirer. 'This guy can't be trusted. He needs to be locked up and have the key thrown away.' 

Since the reports emerged, the family's show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, has been canceled.

Mama June's three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying Michael Cardwell.
