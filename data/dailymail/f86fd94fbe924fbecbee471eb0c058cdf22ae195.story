Whether its champagne, a private island or a Gary Barlow impersonator, sisters Tiffany Wright, 34, and Amanda Brown, 44, know how to make the perfect first date happen.

The sisters, both from London, set up their The One Romance planning business two months ago and say it all came about following a dinner party conversation.

Since then, they have put together everything from romantic picnics to beaches strewn with loving messages in a bottle for their clients.

‘It all started a few years ago when Amanda and I were at a dinner party in Chelsea one evening with some friends,' explains Tiffany.

‘The following day was the first wedding anniversary of the couple who were hosting the evening and at the end of the dinner the host stood up and said he wanted to give his wife her anniversary present – and whipped out a pair of keys.

‘Everyone around the table presumed he had bought her a car and dashed to the window to look outside. But what did we see? A sit on lawn-mower! 

'It was at that moment we realised that some people really do just need a bit of help when it comes to romance.’

‘After the 'lawnmower incident', everyone around the table started chatting about the most unromantic things their husbands had done and Amanda and I found ourselves giving suggestions.

‘At the end of the party, we had 22 business cards in our hands from husbands who wanted our help.

'We now have the business cards framed, with our logo above, hanging in our office. It reminds us of how it all started.’

The sisters combined their experience of proposal planning (Tiffany) and production (Amanda) to set up the business, which has gone from strength-to-strength.

'When people plan something romantic they are often nervous, so seeing a smiling face is always important to them,' explains Tiffany.

'You also have to be incredibly creative. One of our guarantees is that we will never arrange the same romantic experience twice.

‘In terms of our roles, I would say I am the ‘creative’ one. I come up with all of the ideas but sometimes I can get a bit carried away and Amanda has rein me in. 

'She’s more organised than me so she makes sure everything goes off without a hitch!'

Her favourite moments are many, although one - a first wedding anniversary surprise - stands out. 

'We recently planned a gorgeous first wedding anniversary surprise for one couple,' she smiles.

'They came from London but used to visit Devon quite a lot so on their  anniversary they headed to the coast for a romantic weekend.

‘On the Saturday afternoon, the husband suggested they go for a walk along the beach. There his wife kept stumbling across bottles in the sand with messages in them. 

'Each message was a love note and in the last bottle there was a map to a personalised picnic we had set up for them.

‘Around the picnic were reasons he loved her and promises he wanted to make to her. The food was the same food that had been served at their wedding – that was a big challenge!

Tiffany said that sourcing the food for their picnic - what they had eaten at their wedding - was a bit of a challenge!

‘While they were having their picnic, Amanda and I were back at their house unveiling his anniversary gift to her - a huge marble table top, engraved with the signatures of all the guests who had been at their wedding. His wife was totally speechless when she saw it.’

Successes like that, says Tiffany, are all the result of planning. ‘We always try and meet with clients face to face as we feel that’s important,' she explains.

'We will usually meet somewhere glamorous like Soho House or Claridges. Although we’re happy to travel outside of London if that’s where they’re based.

‘We try to find out as much as we can about their partner - from their likes and dislikes, to the type of person they are - sometimes we even ask for their Facebook and Twitter accounts so we can check them out for ourselves!

‘Once we have found out as much as we can, we then go away and come up with two personalised ideas. 

'When we give the ideas back to the guy (complete with mood boards so he can really envisage what its about) it’s up to him if he wants to plan it himself or if we wants us to do it. 

'If we end up planning the whole experience then we still work with him throughout to make sure it is perfect for his partner.

‘Most of our client's partners want to meet us after the event and in some cases we have become lifelong friends,' she continues.

'Just because a guy hires romance planners, it doesn’t mean he hasn’t put any effort in. In fact, we really force our men to contribute as much as possible.

'He needs to know his girlfriend really well if we are to plan something perfect for her - that way he gets to take loads of credit too.’

When Piers decided that he wanted more from his 18 year friendship with his pal Bella, he called on Tiffany and Amanda to organise what can only be described as the most over the top date ever. 

Not only did he hire a Bentley to pick her up from her home in London to take her to the coast, he hired out an entire island for her and organised performances from a Gary Barlow impersonator (he's Bella's favourite performer) and a burlesque dancer. 

Piers hired out Spitbank Fort for his date with Bella as she had always wanted to be stranded on an island with her perfect man

Luckily Piers and Bella's date went well and they are now a very happy couple

At the end of his date he even revealed that he would soon be not only taking her to dinner at Claridges, one of London's finest restaurants, but he'd booked the pair of them a trip to Paris.

According to Tiffany all of his (and their!) hard work paid off and the couple are now happily together. In fact Bella described the first date as having been, 'out of this world.'
