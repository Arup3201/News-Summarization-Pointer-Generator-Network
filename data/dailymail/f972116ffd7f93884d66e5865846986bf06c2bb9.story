A Nato air strike hit a civilian house in Tripoli and killed nine residents, the Libyan regime said yesterday.

Nato admitted on Sunday that its weapons destroyed a house in Tripoli in an incident likely to sow new doubts inside the alliance about its mission in Libya.

The strike on the house was the clearest case yet of a bombing causing multiple civilian casualties, and comes at a time when the alliance is already under strain from a campaign that is taking more time and resources than its backers had expected.

Nato last night admitted that a ‘weapons system failure’ may have been responsible for a missile going astray.

Nato spokesman Wing Commander Mike Bracken said: 'The intended target was a military missile site.

'However from our initial assessment of the facts it appears that one weapons did not strike the intended target due to a weapons system malfunction.

‘Nato regrets the 
loss of innocent civilian lives and takes great care in conducting 
strikes against a regime determined to use violence against its own 
citizens.

‘Although we are still determining 
the specifics of this event, indications are that a weapons system 
failure may have caused this incident.’

Nato did not disclose which country’s
aircraft were involved, although the Ministry of Defence said RAF 
warplanes were not operating in the area at the time.

Libyan government officials took 
reporters to a residential area in Tripoli’s Souq al-Juma district, 
where they saw a body being pulled out of the rubble of a destroyed 
building.

Later, in a hospital, they were shown
the bodies of a child and two others who, officials said, were among a 
total of  nine people killed in the strike.

‘There was intentional and deliberate
targeting of the civilian houses,’ deputy foreign minister Khaled Kaim 
said. ‘This is another sign of the brutality of the West.’

Nato has been pounding targets in 
Libya for months in what the  alliance says is an operation to protect 
civilians who rebelled against Colonel Gaddafi’s 41-year rule. Strains 
are appearing within Nato member states as the campaign drags on for 
longer than most of its backers anticipated and Gaddafi remains in power
– even making a show of defiance last week by playing chess with a 
visiting official.

Rebels from the city of Misrata, 
about 130 miles east of Tripoli, have been trying to push west towards 
the capital but on Sunday they took heavy casualties when they came 
under fire from pro-Gaddafi forces.

A doctor at a field hospital near the
front line in Dafniyah, just west of Misrata, said eight fighters had 
been killed and 36 wounded.

After four months of civil war, 
rebels control the eastern third of Libya, the port city of Misrata and 
much of the Western Mountains region. But they are a long way from 
seizing their prize – Gaddafi’s powerbase of Tripoli and its hinterland –
despite air support from the world’s most powerful military alliance.
