An investigation into the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, initially scheduled for completion this month, is only likely to be finished in September, FIFA said in a statement on Monday.

'We expect to deliver our report to the adjudicatory chamber by the first week of September 2014,' said a statement issued by FIFA on behalf of its ethics committee.

Former United States attorney Michael Garcia has been leading an internal probe by FIFA's ethics committee into allegations of corruption in the run-up to the vote in December 2010, which awarded the tournament to the Gulf state.

Hosts: Qatar held off competition from Australia to win the rights to host the 2022 World Cup

Garcia, who began his investigation 18 months ago, had said in June that he expected to deliver his report by the end of this month.

When complete, Garcia's report will be handed to German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, head of the ethics committee's adjudicatory chamber, and if he finds corruption, Qatar could face a challenge to its position as host either through a re-vote or other processes.

Shortly before the World Cup in Brazil, The Sunday Times reported that some of the 'millions of documents' it had seen linked payments by former FIFA executive committee member Mohamed Bin Hammam to officials to win backing for Qatar's World Cup bid.

Qatar has denied all allegations of corruption.
