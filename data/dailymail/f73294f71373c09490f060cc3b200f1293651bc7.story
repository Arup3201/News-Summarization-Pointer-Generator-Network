Nearly 400 family doctors have signed a petition protesting against controversial plans to close  a highly regarded Accident and Emergency department.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is due to make a decision this week on whether to accept a recommendation by his officials to close the A&E and maternity wards at Lewisham Hospital in South-East London.

But every single GP working in Lewisham – plus hundreds more from the surrounding area – have now written to the Department of Health to express their ‘dismay’ at the plans, which they say ‘ignored overwhelming opposition from the people and from us’.

Plans: There is a recommendation to close A&E and maternity wards at Lewisham Hospital in London

Anger: Protesters from around the country marching past Lewisham Hospital in protest against proposals to scrap the 'high performing' hospital's A&E department

Both Mr Hunt and David Cameron have insisted A&E departments should close only if all of the Government’s four ‘reconfiguration tests’ are met.

But the petition means the plan to close Lewisham fails on the very first of those tests – which requires support from local GPs. The petition will be presented to the Government on Wednesday ahead of Mr Hunt’s decision, which is due by Friday.

Dr Helen Tattersfield, a local GP and chairman of Lewisham Clinical Commissioning Group, said: ‘I know of no GP who supports these proposals across the whole of Lewisham. 

Demand: Nurses who took part in the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony wear their costumes as they join demonstrators in South-East London

Replace: Under proposals being considered by the Government, Lewisham Hospital would see its emergency department replaced with an 'urgent care' ward

‘Everyone is convinced it will be a disaster.’ Dr John Miell,  consultant endocrinologist at the hospital, added: ‘Ripping the heart out of a deprived rainbow community does not fit the normal demographic for healthcare modelling.’

Yesterday an estimated 15,000 people marched through Lewisham in protest against the proposals which are intended to save money for a bankrupt neighbouring Trust – even though Lewisham itself is not in debt.

A spokesman for Mr Hunt said no decision had yet been made. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Doing nothing is not an option.’
