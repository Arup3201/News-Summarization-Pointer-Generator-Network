A hopelessly romantic OCD sufferer says she is unable to meet Mr Right because her illness means she is terrified of love.

Heather Bayliss, who also has Asperger syndrome, would like nothing more than to find a man, but says her crippling obsessive compulsive disorder makes it impossible.

The 39-year-old dreams of the day she can get her debilitating condition under control and settle down with her ideal partner.

But dating poses a horrifying number of issues for Ms Bayliss, who hasn’t invited anyone into her flat for more than three years and who only leaves home to shop or visit her mother.

She finds it extremely stressful to meet new people and to spend time in public places, and her aversion to eye contact means any first date could be disastrous.

Ms Bayliss, from Dorset, said: ‘Any relationship I did have would have to be completely non-contact - an old-fashioned Jane Austen style courtship.

‘My main worry is contamination from other people so there couldn’t be any physical interaction - no hugs, kisses, hand holding - I would need to trust someone before anything like that could happen.

‘If I could meet the right person I would be so happy, but there are just so many extra obstacles that stand in my way because of my OCD and Asperger syndrome.

‘My fear of germs makes it hard for me to go out for food in public too, even something as simple as sitting on a seat in public scares me.

Ms Bayliss is terrified of germs so will not hold hands with anyone, kiss or cuddle. She only leaves her home to go to the shops and to visit her mother. She has not invited anyone into her flat for more than three years

‘And I find social interactions very difficult especially with people I don’t know or have never met before - it’s all very stressful for me. Dating just throws all of these problems at me in one go.

‘As much as I hope I might meet that special someone - I know they would have to accept who I am and be open about my mental health issues.’

Ms Bayliss - who was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome two years ago - believes that it has been subconsciously affecting her relationships her entire life.

Obsessive compulsive disorder:

OCD is a condition that causes a person to have obsessive thoughts and to practice compulsive behaviours.

They experience unpleasant thoughts which cause anxiety.

They also feel compelled to carry out repetitive actions to prevent the unpleasant thoughts coming true.

Symptoms can range from mild to severe and treatment options include cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressants.

Some people with OCD also go on to develop depression.

Asperger syndrome:

Asperger syndrome is a form of autism which is a lifelong condition that affects how a person understands the world and relates to other people.

People with Asperger syndrome tend to struggle with social interaction but are often very intelligent.

They can have difficulty reading facial expressions and tone of voice and can be very literal in their interpretation of language.

They often also struggle to make friends and can behave in an inappropriate manner.

People with Asperger syndrome also tend to like routine and can have obsessive hobbies.

Asperger syndrome is a form of autism which affects how people interact socially and communicate with others - making first dates especially hard for her.

She said: ‘I was only diagnosed with Asperger syndrome two years ago so that has affected all of my relationships without me even knowing.

‘But I found it was a huge relief when I was diagnosed. I had always known there was something different and not quite right.

‘I think I can live with the Asperger syndrome, that’s part of who I am. But I can’t live with the OCD being as bad as it is now - it’s pretty much as bad as it gets.

‘People think OCD is all about cleaning, but it’s not. For me, it’s all about fear and fear completely controls my life and I need to do something to make life a bit more liveable.

‘It’s like a snowball, it slowly gathers speed and over the years things have slowly got worse and worse. And the older I’ve got, the more I have found to worry about.’

Ms Bayliss’s extreme OCD has left her terrified of even the most simple interactions leaving her confined to her flat for the majority of the time.

The extremity of her condition has increased over the past five years and Ms Bayliss turned to internet dating with the hope of meeting someone to share her life with.

Reluctant to give up her search for ‘the one’, she said: ‘I have used internet dating sites in the hope of meeting someone special but it is so hard to know when to be honest with people.

‘I have been open and honest on my profile straight away, and had absolutely no messages from anyone.

‘And I have hidden my mental health 
issues from people and we’ve started talking, but as soon as I have been
 honest they have dropped off the radar and I never hear from them 
again.

‘It’s just so difficult to know when to open up, but I just feel like why should I have to hide who I am?’

Ms Bayliss says she has tried internet dating but that potential partners lose interest in her when they learn about her OCD and Asperger syndrome

Ms Bayliss said: 'As much as I hope I might meet that special someone - I know they would have to accept who I am and be open about my mental health issues'

Caroline Hattersley, from the National Autistic Society, said: ‘Asperger syndrome is a form of autism, a lifelong developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with and relates to others.

‘For some people with autism, even ordinary, everyday conversation and social interaction can lead to misunderstandings, confusion or upset, and so negotiating the ‘minefield’ of more intimate relationships can be challenging.

‘The social and communication difficulties that people with autism experience can sometimes make it hard for them to form close friendships and relationships, but the majority would like to have more friends.

‘It’s vital that more is done to support those with the condition so that they do not become isolated, and befriending services and social groups can make a world of difference.’
