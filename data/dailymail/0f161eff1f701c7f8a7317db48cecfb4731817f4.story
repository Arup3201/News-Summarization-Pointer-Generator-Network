Roberto Mancini is at loggerheads with his captain Vincent Kompany after claiming the Belgian defied him by playing for his country in midweek.

Having not played for Manchester City since injuring his calf at the end of January, Kompany surprised everybody by playing for Belgium in their World Cup win over Macedonia in midweek.

Despite the Belgian FA telling Sportsmail last night that Mancini’s medical staff were fully aware of Marc Wilmots’ intention to play Kompany, the City boss launched a wide-ranging attack at the player and his national coach.

Defiant: Roberto Mancini says Yaya Toure will not leave Manchester City this summer

How they stand: City are 15 points behind United

Mancini said: ‘I said to him, “Stay 
here to have more treatment but don’t go to play because it would be 
taking a risk for us because these next two months are really 
important”. He said that the manager called him and he should go.

‘I can’t put him in jail for two 
weeks, can I? It is OK for him to go there and have a fitness test with 
their medical people but after that he should come back.

‘It was important that Vinny worked 
here and prepared well for the last two months of the season because he 
hasn’t played for us for 60 days.

‘I hoped he would come back after one 
day, two days. I think sometimes the player has to understand that the 
club is more important.

‘I’m not saying that international football is not important because I never say to my players, “Don’t go to the national team”.

‘But there are some cases when the 
club is more important. If he had got another injury, or if on Saturday 
he is not ready to play because he played for the national team, and I 
lost him for another month, for me this is not correct by the player or 
the manager.’

Last night the Belgian FA hit back at 
Mancini. A spokesman said: ‘We’re surprised by Mr Mancini’s reaction as 
he did know Vincent was playing the second game, as there were close 
contacts between our medical staff and the doctors at Manchester City.

‘Vincent wasn’t fit to play against 
Everton two weeks ago or in our first game but our medical staff made 
him ready for the second game. We don’t understand why they are 
complaining. They got their player back in full fitness.’

Professionalism: City's stars will be hoping to seal second place, starting with a victory over Newcastle

Wrapped up: Sergio Aguero in City's bootroom ahead of training

Mancini hopes Kompany will be fit for tomorrow’s Barclays Premier League game against Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium.

‘I don’t know if he is OK or not — we will see his condition today,’ he added.

‘He didn’t play for us for 60 days and
went to play for the Belgian national team. I did not agree with it. 
Managers of national teams should understand. These players play for 
their clubs, and every month the clubs pay their salary.

‘I tried to talk to the Belgium manager when Vinny was first injured. But probably he didn’t understand very well.’
