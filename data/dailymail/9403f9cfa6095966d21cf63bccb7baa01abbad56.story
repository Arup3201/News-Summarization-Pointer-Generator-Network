Missouri L-G Peter Kinder has asked for an expense account due to his 'gradual impoverishment'

Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder wants more money for doing his job.

The Republican officeholder is asking legislators to put money in the budget for a daily expense allowance when he is working in Jefferson City.

Kinder lives in Cape Girardeau and maintains a second home in Jefferson City. 

He receives an annual salary of about $86,000. But Kinder says he's experienced 'gradual impoverishment' during his decade in office.

His salary is less than other statewide executive officials, but well more than the $36,000 that legislators receive.

One of the lieutenant governor's duties is to preside over the Senate. 

Kinder, who is the number two to Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, wants to receive the same allowance that legislators get, which is $103 a day.   

He's seeking a per diem whenever he's in Jefferson City, not just when the Legislature meets. 

The median household income for Missouri in 2010 was $44,306, according to the US Census Bureau Small Area Estimates Branch. 

Kinder's Cape Giradeau home is worth an estimated $186,000. 

Kinder's salary is lower than what other statewide officials earn. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koser was paid $116,000 last year. Secretary of State Jason Kander made $106,000. Governor Jay Nixon earned $134,000.

Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from Mr Kinder's office on Thursday. 

Prior to entering public office, Kinder was an attorney and then later went into real estate, reportedly working for the Drury Hotel Group.

In 2011, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported that over five years, the public official had billed the state for around two months per year at hotels around St Louis. 

The bill was $35,000 for hotels, with the most nights spent at the Chase Park Plaza hotel in St Louis. 

St Louis is about a two-hour drive from Jefferson City and 90 minutes from his home in Cape Girardeau.
