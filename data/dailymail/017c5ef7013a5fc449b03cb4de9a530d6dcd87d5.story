As if seeing the Northern Lights wasn't special enough, Scotland has also been treated to rare displays of fireballs streaking across its skies this week.

One of the fireballs was seen lighting up the sky above Sligachan on the Isle of Skye.

The rare event was accidentally captured by landscape photographer Marcus McAdam, who has been working on a time lapse video showing a year on Skye condensed into minutes.

Recently, Mr McAdam set his camera to record the stars over the Cuillin Mountains overnight.

Describing what he discovered the next day, Mr McAdam said: ‘As I was loading the images onto my computer, one thumbnail stood out as being quite different to the others, so I enlarged it and saw a huge streak across the sky’.

Unsure what he had captured, he asked his Facebook followers and they pointed to a news story about reports of a fireball seen in the sky.

Amazingly, he has since discovered that the phenomenon he recorded was a different fireball - meaning there two within 50 miles of each other at around the same time.

Mr McAdam said: ‘I've since learnt that this is an extremely rare event, and even rarer to be photographed, as the whole thing happens in less than a second.’

Other images were captured by amateur photographers Ewan Miles and Byron Griffiths in the west Highlands on Monday night.

Mr Miles’ snaps were taken from Salen Bay, east of Ardnamurchan Point, when the shooting light suddenly flew through the atmosphere.

He said: ‘The solar winds were blowing on and off all throughout the night and visible through the breaks in the cloud.

‘A huge fireball was a real highlight, which lit up the surrounding landscape for a couple of seconds as it burnt through our atmosphere.

Byron Griffiths took this spectacular pictures while out waiting for the Aurora Borealis to show above the Isle of Lewis. The photo was taken at around about half past eight on Monday night. He said: 'I was out to try and photograph the Aurora Borealis and by nothing more than luck the fireball appeared and fell through the field of view of the camera'

‘It was the biggest one I have ever seen and there were plenty of other meteors showing, which could be part of the annual Orionid (corr) shower.’

The Northern Lights are created when particle streams from the sun crash into atoms high up in the atmosphere.

Earlier this month, a powerful solar flare directed at Earth has put on majestic display of the northern lights across parts of Canada, the U.S and Ireland.

The effects are greater at the magnetic poles and weaken as they move south from the Arctic or north of the Antarctic.

The intensity and frequency of Northern Lights activity is governed by solar cycles that lasts for 11 years.

Nasa scientists have predicted that the current period of solar activity will reach a new peak in December.

On an official NASA video, Todd Hoeksema, the Director of the Wilcox Solar Observatory at Stanford University, said that by December there should be what is termed a ‘solar flip’.

This is when the conditions for viewing the lights would be at their best.
