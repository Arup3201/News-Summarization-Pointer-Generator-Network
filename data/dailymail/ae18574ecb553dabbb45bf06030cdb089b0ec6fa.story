Not only is Michael Phelps the most decorated Olympian of all time, with 18 swimming golds to his name - he's also a natural at golf.

The U.S. sportsman holed the longest putt ever recorded on TV from more than 150ft (50 yards) at the famous Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland.

His effortless skill was showcased on Friday at the Kingsbarns course, six miles east of St Andrews, where he proved his sporting prowess extends well on to dry land.

His putt was only slightly shorter than the length of an Olympic swimming pool - a distance he knows very well.

He smashed the existing world record of 99ft (33 yards), which was set by broadcaster Terry Wogan at 
Gleneagles in 1981.

The jaw-dropping putt, which took a full 17 seconds to drop, probably even elicited envy from his partner, former Ryder Cup player Paul Casey.

'It was the longest putt I've ever had and to see it go in was a pretty cool feeling,' Phelps, 27, said afterwards.

'I will never forget it. I just tried to get it to the top of the rise in the green and I couldn’t believe it when it then ran down the other side and all the way into the hole.

'It was a great moment. I just had to give a bit of a Tiger-esque fist pump.'

Casey's caddy said he believed the putt was from 153ft, or 51 yards.

The monster putt was selected as the ‘Shot of the Day’ by Sky Sports commentator, Ewen Murray.

Murray said: 'It was quite simply the perfect putt. Travelling down three different levels at the perfect pace it was well over 150ft (50 yards) in length.

'It was made all the more amazing 
because he hit the worst shot of the day on the 18th at Carnoustie, not 
even making the bairn with a 40-yard approach shot.'

The putt gave the 'Baltimore Bullet', who was playing off a 16-handicap, a net hole-in-one at the 337-yard sixth hole and he followed that up with a net eagle (two under par) at the seventh.

Olympian feat: 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius also shone at the Championship in St Andrews

It was an eventful round for Phelps and 
Casey, as a dog - later named on Twitter as Digby - ran on to the green 
at the 12th and stole Casey's ball.

Unfortunately, the swimmer's second-round success was not enough to bring him triumph here, and he and his partner finished 15 under par.

Olympian Oscar Pistorius also took part in the tournament, sinking a birdie putt on the 18th green at St Andrews.

The South African 'Blade Runner' said: 'That was a wonderful way to end what has been such a great week. Playing in this tournament has been phenomenal, and even better than I expected it to be.'
