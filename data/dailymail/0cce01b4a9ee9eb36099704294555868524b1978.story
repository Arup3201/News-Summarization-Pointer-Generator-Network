Even amid the tumult, his last words are said to have resounded clearly. 'Gentlemen, I bid you farewell.'

With that, Wallace Hartley, bandleader of the Titanic, was washed away - with his precious violin, in its case, strapped to his waist.

Folklore has it that, moments earlier, in an incredible act of stoicism, he struck up the hymn Nearer My God To Thee to calm passengers as the doomed liner slid beneath the icy waters of the North Atlantic.

Perhaps the story has been embellished a little over the years since. Certainly it is one of the most memorable scenes from the James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic.

Yesterday, the violin of Wallace Hartley, bandleader of the Titanic, sold at auction for more than £1me

Yesterday, Mr Hartley's story reached its extraordinary conclusion in the sleepy Wiltshire town of Devizes. There, his precious violin - which memorabilia hunters regarded as something of a Holy Grail and assumed had been lost forever - was sold at auction for more than £1 million to a British Titanic 'connoisseur'.

Hartley and his seven fellow band members all died in the tragedy in 1912. Their bodies were recovered two weeks later.

A gift from Hartley's fiancee Maria Robinson, the violin was inscribed 'For WALLACE on the occasion of our engagement from MARIA'. 

Wallace was the son of a humble Lancashire choirmaster but Miss Robinson, 32, was a woman 'of private means' - the daughter of a wealthy cloth manufacturer. She paid around £40 for the violin in 1910, the equivalent of £2,630 today.

The fate of Hartley's violin has always been a mystery to Titanic scholars. The bodies of the band leader and two other musicians were pulled from the water by a search crew from the CS Mackay-Bennett and taken to Nova Scotia, Canada.

Violinist John Law Hume from  Dumfries in Scotland and bass player John Frederick Preston Clarke from Liverpool were laid to rest in Halifax but Hartley's body was repatriated  to England and buried at Colne,  Lancashire, the town where he was born and raised.

Newspapers at the time reported that 
Hartley was found fully dressed with his violin strapped to his chest. 
However, when the effects of Body 224 were itemised by The Office of the
 Provincial Secretary in Nova Scotia, there was no mention of it.

Other
 than his clothes and spare change, he had only a ring, a pen, a silver 
matchbox, a gold cigar holder, a watch and chain, a collar stud, a pair 
of scissors and two pieces of correspondence. It was not among the 
possessions handed back to his father Albion Hartley, who collected the 
 body from the  ship The Arabic at Liverpool docks. The assumption has 
long been that the instrument was spirited away by someone involved in 
collecting the corpses.

So 
when the violin re-emerged in 2006 - it was found in an attic in North 
Yorkshire - its rediscovery prompted feverish debate over its 
authenticity.

Titanic 
specialist auctioneers Henry Aldridge & Son insist that nearly  
seven subsequent years of research and tests have proved it to be the  
genuine article.

For while the violin was never included on any official inventory, it had indeed been recovered. This was because Maria, devastated at Wallace's death, wrote to the authorities explaining its sentimental importance and asking for it to be sent directly back to her.

The draft of her subsequent thank-you letter to the authorities in Maria Robinson's diary reads: 'I would be most grateful if you could convey  my heartfelt thanks to all who have made possible the return of my late fiance's violin.

'May I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to you  personally for your gracious intervention on my behalf.'

Steve Turner, author of The Band That 
Played On, which tells the story of 33-year-old Hartley and the 
Titanic's band said: 'The story behind the violin involves love as it 
was a gift from his fiancee. And it of course symbolises bravery and 
religion.

He added: 'It sums up all that you would like to believe from the tragedy. You can't imagine anything more iconic.'

He
 added: 'Because the violin was a gift from Maria to Wallace on their 
engagement, it makes sense that she was the rightful heir rather than 
Hartley's parents. I wonder whether Hartley clung on to it so tightly 
because it was a gift from his wife-to-be. Otherwise he might just have 
let it go.'

The violin 
remained Maria's most treasured possession and she never married. On her
 death in 1939, it was passed to her sister Margaret Robinson who in 
turn donated it to the Salvation Army at Bridlington, East Yorkshire.

'Then
 it was passed to a Salvation Army music teacher who played the violin. 
She passed it to one of her pupils called Eve, who held on to it until 
she died in the 1980s,' said Mr Turner. 'When her son, a lecturer, came 
to clear out her loft he fondly remembered playing it as a youth and put
 it in his own attic.'

There
 it remained until 2006 when, unaware of its provenance, he began to 
wonder whether 'it might be worth something' and asked an expert to 
'cast an eye over it'.

By 
the time the experts arrived at his modest three-bedroom bunglaow, he 
had already worked out that it was 'Titanic related' and 'might be of 
interest'.

But
 in an yet another twist it emerged yesterday that the lecturer, who has
 not being named, died two months ago. 'His family has become the main 
beneficiary,' said Mr Turner. 'He wanted a lot of the money to go to 
charity.

'It was never about the money with him, though, as he would have sold it years ago.

In
 yesterday's auction, the violin had a reserve price of between £200,000
 and £300,000 and was expected to reach as much as £400,000. About 200 
people packed out the sale room in the hope of  capturing a piece of 
history. Many stood at the back of the room as there were not enough 
chairs.

Within a couple of 
minutes, bidding had broken £100,000 and soon passed the £220,000 world 
record for Titanic memorabilia as the competition between four telephone
 bidders hotted up. There were gasps from the audience as the price 
reached £350,000 and then raced upwards to £600,000.

The room fell silent when bidding hit £750,000.

The violin eventually sold for £900,000 (£1,185,000 once commission and VAT were added) after fierce bidding between two telephone bidders. Selling the violin had taken just ten minutes.

Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge  said the 'ecstatic' new owner was British. 'He is a very knowledgeable Titanic connoisseur.

'He will enjoy it and probably put it on public display in the future. He's a very successful individual.'

The violin has been on exhibition since May at Titanic Branson and Titanic Pigeon Forge in the United States where more than 315,000 viewed it and later at Titanic Belfast, the award-winning visitor attraction in Northern Ireland.
