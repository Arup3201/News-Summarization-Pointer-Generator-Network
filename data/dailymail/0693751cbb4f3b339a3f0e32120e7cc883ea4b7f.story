That tearful, emotional cuddle between Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho before Sunday’s game at Old Trafford made me feel sick.

What was all that about?

This is Chelsea at Old Trafford to take on Manchester United. These are the two clubs who fought out a fierce rivalry from 2004 when Arsenal bid the big-time farewell and settled for mediocrity, all the way through to 2012 when Manchester City emerged as champions.

Sure there was respect between Fergie and Jose, but you didn’t have an emotional hug in the tunnel pre-match.

I don’t care if they know each other and worked with each other, they are now sworn enemies.

Van Gaal should have disarmed Mourinho by blanking him completely until after the game. It might not have affected Jose, but hugging him?

You’ve got a lot to learn Louis, the Premier League is all about the rivalry, so cosying up to the manager of Chelsea is not the way things are done.

Their faces were sterner after the game but they still found time for another hug

Ten years on from Fergie having pizza thrown at him in the tunnel by fierce enemies Arsenal, we had a love-in at Old Trafford this weekend.

Mourinho normally disrespects opposition managers by offering a handshake before the final whistle. At Old Trafford he couldn’t wait to charge up the steps to the United dug-out to embrace Van Gaal.

It’s only a couple of years ago Mourinho was going too far with his antics, thrusting his finger into the eye of an opposition coach, the late Tito Vilanova. He was getting under the skin of a great like Pep Guardiola to the point where Pep left Barcelona because he was so stressed by the pressure.

'He is special,' said Van Gaal of Mourinho, pre-match.

Yes we know, he told us that himself years ago.

Mourinho is showing us some true quality managing Chelsea this season. So this isn’t about the football on the pitch. It’s about the rivalry of two great clubs.

Thankfully the United fans launched into songs targeting Mourinho from the first whistle – that’s what this fixture should be about.

The 1-1 draw was gutting for Jose, but I almost got a sense that he was happy to give his friend – football friend – a point in his fight to get United back to where they think they belong.

Message to Van Gaal, instead of whispering sweet nothings into Mourinho’s ear, you should have spent more time getting the message out that Rafael can’t possibly be designated the role of picking up Didier Drogba at a corner.

Message to Mourinho – are you going soft as you get older? Show some edge when you go to United, don’t roll over and let your old boss tickle your tummy like a pussycat.

Chelsea should not be friends of Manchester United. They should be arch-rivals.

The respective managers should be conscious of that and save the love-in until after the main event is over.

Throw some pizza instead of hugging each other like long-lost lovers.
