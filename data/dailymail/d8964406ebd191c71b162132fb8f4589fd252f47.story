Sandra Howard has picked her way through 60 of M&S's collection of party dresses and come up with the best eight to cover all party occasions

This time last year I stepped through the door to Jeffrey Archer’s magnificent London penthouse feeling great.

Sportsmen, politicians and a few showbiz faces filled the room, with its sensational views of the Thames.

But in my new little black dress, complete with flattering scooped neckline and flouncy full skirt, I felt I held my own.

The dress was a High Street number — classic and understated rather than attention-grabbing, but I received more compliments on it than I can remember.

I felt stylish, comfortable and, more importantly, sexy. (Judging from the look on my husband Michael’s face, he agreed.)

Such is the power of the Little Black Dress, or LBD, a garment which can take a woman from frumpy to fabulous in the time it takes to do up a zip and slip on some stockings. 

And — joy! — never have we had more varieties from which to choose.

After months of unflattering jumpsuits and garish neons being the height of fashion, the LBD is back with a vengeance on the High Street this season, nowhere more so than at Marks & Spencer, which has produced an incredible 60 LBDs in time for the Christmas party season.

Its range promises cuts and fabrics to suit any age and occasion, but is there anything on offer which can hold a candle to the dress which caused interested looks at Jeffrey’s glamorous party?

To save you time, I’ve reviewed all M&S’s Christmas LBDs, and here are my pick of the best...

The secret support dress, £59, (left) has been voted best for a hot date while the £45 black ruched dress with sleeves scored a perfect 10/10 for dressing up or down

BEST FOR A HOT DATE

Secret Support Dress, £59

Maybe I am being a little prim, but this is too fitted for me.

I feel like I am wearing a girdle, and it does pull in tummy, thighs and waist to give an hourglass shape.

It’s a dress for a date. But at 73 years old, dates don’t come along that often!

It’s also a little short for me. However, at this time of year Michael and I often have parties to go to and he would love to see me in this. 

6/10

BEST FOR DRESSING  UP — OR DOWN

Black ruched dress with sleeves, £45

This is my favourite. It drapes beautifully, giving a lovely, feminine silhouette and is comfortable, too.

It would work well for a New Year lunch in town or for a casual supper with friends.

It’s can be dressed up or down, as well as being impossible to crease.

10/10

For glamour, Sandra recommends the Autograph leather pencil dress, £249 (left), and for attending winter parties the velvet sparkly dress, £45, provides a touch of fun

BEST FOR GLAMOROUS DAYWEAR

Autograph leather pencil dress, £249

Nobody’s too old for leather if it’s cut well and I love that this dress fits like a glove. It reminds me of a Sixties sheath dress and it feels very soft against bare skin.

I think I’d go up a size — I’m usually a ten — so that I could wear it with a shirt underneath, which would work for a daytime look.

This would be a great dress to go from desk to drinks in, but my only gripe is the length: I would prefer another inch or so.

It’s more expensive than the other dresses, but still very good value for leather.

8/10

BEST FOR A WINTER PARTY

Velvet sparkly dress, £45

This is fun and I love the puffed sleeves.

The material is stretchy (no need for a zip) and it drapes well so doesn’t feel tight but holds its shape.

If, like me, you are a woman of a certain age, I would recommend wearing this with a statement necklace, because there is quite a bit of decolletage on show.

I am a little self-conscious about my scraggy neck, but chunky jewellery works wonders.

Pick up the gold fleck in the fabric with a pair of gold heels.

9/10

For any business dinners look no further than this hand beaded dress with lace sleeves, £79 (left), while the elegant black lace dress £69 (right) is perfect for cocktail parties

BEST FOR A BUSINESS DINNER

Hand-beaded dress with lace sleeves, £79

This is a very formal style which can be a little ageing. It’s safe for any occasion, but almost too demure and conservative.

Lots of women my age will like the cut, but I prefer a little more flair. It would look better on someone with a bit more cleavage than me. But the lace is good quality, and soft rather than itchy.

6/10

BEST FOR  COCKTAIL PARTIES

Black lace dress, £69

My head is not usually turned by fads, but lace does seem to be everywhere this year, and I’d rather buy this from M&S than spend a fortune on a designer version.

It’s a great party dress — the neckline and sleeves are flattering, adding shape to the decolletage.

My husband would love this because it’s demure, but a bit flirty, too.

9/10

Adventurous under-30s willing to show a bit of leg could opt for the Limited Edition skater dress with embellished neckline, £59, (left) while for the all-important Christmas day the velvet dress with sweetheart neckline and lace sleeves has it covered at £45

BEST FOR THE UNDER THIRTIES

Limited Edition skater dress with embellished neckline, £59

For a sleeveless dress, this is rather forgiving. The cutaway shoulders are flattering and the pretty neckline draws the eye from any glimpse of the dreaded bingo wings.

But while the fabric looks and feels expensive, it is far too short for mature ladies like me.

5/10

BEST FOR CHRISTMAS DAY

Velvet dress with sweetheart neckline and lace sleeves, £45

This is what I would describe as a Christmas-y dress because I would be unlikely to wear it at any other time.

It just screams festive. And you really can’t beat the warmth of a velvet dress with sleeves.

The dress could be an inch shorter — on the knee rather than below. But the sleeves are lovely, and I like the little heart print which is very on-trend.

7/10

SANDRA’S VERDICT:

M&S has done itself proud! The LBD should fulfil two purposes: to make its wearer feel elegant and chic; and to draw admiring glances. These certainly tick both boxes.

I’m overjoyed that most of the new black dresses from M&S come with sleeves, as, like most mature ladies, I don’t usually like to reveal my arms.

There are plenty of versatile styles here that could take me from glitzy parties to casual dinners over the next few weeks without breaking the bank.

Now there’s just one problem: which LBD to choose?
