Actor Brian Cobby, who was immortalised as the voice of BT’s speaking clock, has died. 

Mr Cobby, 83, of Brighton, was the famous voice of the service for 22 years and died last week following a series of health problems.

Clive Cobby, his brother said: 'He was a man of the world, who loved life and lived it to the full.'He was larger than life. 

Brian Cobby was the voice of the speaking clock for 22 years and was the first male to to do it. Brian's recording was replaced by that of Sara Mendes da Costa in 1997

'He never married and some people assumed he was alone, but he had a large family and was very popular.

'In every sense, he was an actor. He was very outgoing.'

Mr Cobby had a very successful career prior to becoming the speaking clock from 1984 to 2007.

In the sixties, he was known as 'The 
Voice' and was one of the nation’s best known voiceover artists - 
launching a thousand soapflakes, prescribing every headache cure known 
to man and convincing the country they couldn’t tell the difference 
between Stork and butter.

His recording of 'on the third stroke' was heard an estimated two billion times by users of the speaking clock

Another
famous recording he did was the well-known 'Five, four, three, two, 
one, Thunderbirds are go,' for the TV series, although some believe 
another voice actor did the announcement.

He
also appeared alongside Madonna in the film Evita. Consummate 
professional Brian took just one hour to record the 86 words that make 
up the speaking clock’s 8,640 daily announcements.

Mr
Cobby's voice was heard to say 'on the third stroke' an estimated two 
billion times and he was regularly stopped in the street and asked the 
time.

Following a kidney transplant 15 years ago and a heart attack last year, his health had been deteriorating and he died at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.

His funeral will include a show reel of his most famous recordings.

Thunderbirds Are Go: Millions fondly remember the dramatic '5.4.3.2.1.' opening sequence of the hit TV show. Mr Cobby provided the voice
