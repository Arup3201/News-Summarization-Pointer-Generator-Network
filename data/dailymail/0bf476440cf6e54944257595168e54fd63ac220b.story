The mother of a girl with a fatal disease yesterday begged to be allowed to have Britain's first 'three-parent' baby.

Vicky Holliday wants to be able to implant DNA from a donor egg into one of her own eggs which would be fertilised by her partner's sperm.

This would stop her passing on her own faulty genetic material to a second child, who would effectively have three parents. 

British scientists have spent 15 years researching the IVF technique – and MPs will vote tomorrow on whether to make it legal.

Supporters – including five Nobel prize winners – have hailed it as a godsend to parents who need to avoid passing incurable diseases to their children.

Opponents say that creating 'designer babies' crosses an ethical line and the science is unproven.

Miss Holliday's daughter Jessica, who was born in 2013, has Leigh syndrome, which is caused by her mother's faulty mitochondrial DNA.

The crippling illness targets the vital organs and means the one-year-old will never walk or talk and is likely to die within a few years.

Miss Holliday, a 38-year-old management consultant from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, told the Sunday Times: 'We adore Jessica. To us she's special and unique but to have another child knowing what they could suffer doesn't bear thinking about.

'If MPs vote to allow the treatment it will not only be fantastic for us but help so many others too.

'When you're given the worst possible news it helps to have a little bit of hope. It would mean so much to us to be able to have a healthy child.'

Around one in 5,000 Britons are believed to suffer from mitochondrial disorders, which are passed from mother to child, and researchers believe around 2,500 women of child-bearing age are carriers.

The Rev Dr Brendan McCarthy said the Archbishops’ Council did not believe there has been sufficient scientific study or consultation into the ethics, safety and efficacy of the technique

Many children with the conditions are disabled and die in infanthood and women carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly.

International charities and campaigners wrote an open letter to MPs to lobby them to change the law, saying it 'offers families the first glimmer of hope that they might be able to have a baby that will live without pain and suffering'.

It said: 'Mitochondrial disease is unimaginably cruel. It strips our children of the skills they have learned, inflicts pain that cannot be managed, and tires their organs one by one until their little bodies cannot go on any more.

'We know that no novel medical procedure is without risk. We have absolute confidence in the expert scientific panel that has extensively scrutinised these techniques.'

Miss Holliday is being treated by Doug Turnbull, a neurology professor at Newcastle University who has pioneered the mitochondrial replacement technique.

He is expected to be the first to carry out such treatment, which involves replacing faulty mitochondrial DNA in a mother's egg with healthy cells from a donor.

Sally Davies, the Government's chief medical officer, has likened the technique to 'changing a faulty car battery'.

But critics including Lord Deben – former Tory minister John Gummer – want a committee to consider if the science is safe before any change to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.

A recent safety report by the watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, said the procedure should not be used to create babies until further tests had been carried out. Miss Holliday hopes to watch the vote in the House of Commons from the public gallery with daughter and her partner Keith Newell. If the change is approved by MPs and peers, it will not become law until October.

The Church of England has warned against making a decision without knowing more about how hereditary characteristics are passed on by mitochondria – the tiny 'engine rooms' that power cells in the body.
