Forgetful: Ellie Palin, 14, with all that remains of the hair straighters, which sparked the blaze

Fire tore through a family home gutting a teenager's bedroom after she FORGOT to unplug her hair straighteners... a day after her angry parents berated her for leaving them on.

Ellie Palin said she is consumed by guilt after leaving the straighteners on in her bedroom as she got ready to go out with friends on Monday night.

The hot wand sparked a blaze, which ravaged Ellie's bedroom, consuming a wardrobe and destroying the room.

The 14-year-old's older brother Callum raised the alarm after smelling smoke and spotting the flames when he went in search of a snack.

The family have been forced to move in with relatives while their bungalow in Knypersely, near Biddulph in Staffordshire is repaired.

Ellie said: 'I had turned the straighteners off but not unplugged them.

'I thought my mum was joking when she told me what happened. It was quite a shock.

'I
feel really guilty about it because it was my fault and it's affected 
the rest of the house. I'm going to be really paranoid about my 
straighteners now.'

Furious mother Marianne, 44, said her daughter had been repeatedly warned at the weekend about leaving the straighteners on.

The teaching support assistant said she arrived home to find her son standing in the drive, and opened the door to a wall of thick black smoke.

'My husband shouted at her on Sunday about leaving them on,' said Mrs Palin.

'She feels very guilty about it. It has been a very harsh lesson for her. My son was the only one in the house at the time.

Consumed by guilt: Ellie said she feels 'very guilty' after the family were forced to move out of their home while repairs are carried out. Her parents repeatedly reminded their forgetful daughter to turn off her straighteners

'He happened to come down from the loft conversion for something to eat and smelled the smoke.

'The smoke alarms didn't go off. I came back shortly after and Callum was standing on the drive. He told me not to go in.

'I opened the front door and saw this wall of black smoke.

'We are all in shock. I think it's still sinking in. Luckily we are fully insured.'

Callum, 15, added: 'I only came downstairs because I got hungry.

Paranoid: The forgetful teen said: 'I feel really guilty about it because it is all my fault and it's affected the rest of the house. I am going to be really paranoid about my straighteners now'

Lucky escape: Ellie's older brother Callum, 15, said he was lucky the fire hadn't spread by the time he got up to make a snack

'When I looked in my sister's room I could see the wardrobe on fire. I shut the bedroom door and called the fire brigade.

'I feel lucky because it could have spread and I would have been stuck upstairs.'

Firefighters called to the home in Knypersely, Staffordshire battled the flames for around three hours.

Station manager Carl Mason, from Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'It 
is vital that after using hair straighteners, you turn them off at the 
socket and unplug them immediately.

'They can reach up to 200 degrees so should always be treated with extreme care and left to cool on a heat proof surface.

'By taking these simple steps, you could avoid devastating consequences.'
