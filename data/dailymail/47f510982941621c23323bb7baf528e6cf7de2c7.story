A Washington man injected his 4-year-old son with heroin on the day his divorce from his wife was finalized, in an attempt to kill the boy with an overdose, police have revealed.

Eric Emil Lehtinen, 37, is accused of repeatedly jabbing in young son with needles and injecting him with heroin and a cocktail of other drugs, among them ketamine, morphine and codeine.

He then injected himself with high doses of drugs, as well. When the boy's mother when to Lehtinen's Redmond, Washington, home to pick her son up, she found both Lehtinen and the child unconscious.

A needle was still sticking out of the boy's chest, according to police.

The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports that Lehtinen's wife of six years allowed the couple's son to stay with Lehtinen while she went out of town for a job interview - despite her husband's history as both a heroin addict and a heroin dealer.

She returned to Redmond last Tuesday - on the very day that her divorce from her husband was finalized, authorities say.

Both Lehtinen and the child were rushed to the hospital. Both survived.

The child is still recovering at Seattle Children's Hospital. It is unknown whether he will suffer long-term damage from the drugs that were pumped into his system.

Prosecutors believe Lehtinen was trying to kill the boy and himself with drugs - but failed.

Lehtinen is charged with attempted murder.

Lt. Charlie Gorman told q13fox.com: 'In 35 years as a police officer I’ve never run across anything like this.'

A neighbor added: 'I just don’t understand how messed up you have to be to inject your 4-year-old with heroin.'
