They say if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen - and that's exactly what happened to one hapless cook who had to be rushed off to hospital after tasting a hot chilli sauce at his restaurant.

Arif Ali, 26, suffered a severe reaction as he tried out the concoction, which had been prepared for a Man v Food-style hot wings challenge at Jimmy's restaurant, in London's O2 arena.

The sauce contained Naga Jolokia chillis, which measure 250,000 on the Scoville scale of chilli strength - far hotter than pepper spray and so potent that they should only be handled using latex gloves.

According to one onlooker, Mr Ali happily tasted the food as customers cheered him on, but he began sweating. After drinking some milk, he carried on eating two more of the flaming hot chicken wings.

'But then he started gasping. The sweat was pouring off him and he collapsed at the table,' the witness told The Daily Star.

'He was then carried off by a few staff into a car and rushed to hospital. One minute he was fine - the next he passed out and was in real trouble.'

Staff drove him to Hillingdon hospital, where he was treated and later discharged, but Mr Ali spent the next week suffering severe stomach cramps and diarrhea.

The restaurant had wanted to challenge the boldest among customers with its fiery sauce, in the style of television series, Man v Food, where enthusiast Adam Richman takes on a range of extreme eating challenges.

But the sauce has now been shelved.

Restaurant manager Salim Khan said: 'We have now decided in the interests of customer safety not to put this particular item on our menu.'

Chilli collapse: Arif Ali was rushed to Hillingdon Hospital, where he was treated following his hot sauce reaction.

Richman style: Jimmy's restaurant had tried to challenge customers in the same way Man V Food presenter Adam Richman explores extreme eating in his television series.
