A severely autistic
20-year old about to graduate from high school has made a touching appeal
to President Obama to help him get a place at college.

Tugging on the heart-strings, Billy Pagoni, from Naples,
Florida, made his appeal to the leader of the free world via Facebook after struggling
to find an institution willing to accept him.

Diagnosed with severe autism aged 18 months, Billy is so
affected by the disorder that he still has trouble speaking fluently.

Presidential Address: Reading from a sheet, Billy Pagoni has asked President Obama for help getting a college place

With seemingly no available programs across the nation able
to take on someone with his specialised needs, Billy’s direct video to
President Obama has become widely viewed across the internet.

‘Dear President Obama, my name is Billy Pagoni,’ explained the hopeful student who appears slightly nervous with his address to the Commander in
Chief.

‘I want to be a baker. I am a great student. I never miss a
day of school.

‘I get straight A’s on my report card. Please, can you help
me get to college?

‘I am an American. I am autistic.’

Going to the top for help: Posting his video on Facebook, Billy is hoping to raise awareness of severely autistic children's plight gaining a college place

Giving the camera a cute wave at the end of his public plea,
Billy is struggling with a system that doesn’t seem to cater for college
applicants who have autism.

With universities across the country currently offering
programs for blind, deaf and high functioning Asperger’s students, the options
for severely autistic high school students are small to nothing.

‘When you look online, it looks like, yes there are programs
for these students,’ said Billy’s mother Edith Pagoni the director of KNEADS, a non-profit social and vocational program for adolescents and young adults with autism in Naples.

‘But what universities actually have are programmes for
extremely rare, high functioning, savant-like autistic children.

‘There is nothing for kids who have splintered skills - for
those who are excellent with computers, but may need a subject like geography
broken down for them.

'I am an American. I am autistic.' Billy's plea to President Obama has spread across the internet

‘There’s a complete generation of these kids who are aging
out of school, who will have nothing to do.

'If colleges had a program for autism that addresses
specific skills for these kids, there would be people at the door waiting.’

Billy is known around his Naples as the ‘puzzle-boy’ as he is adept at
gluing puzzles together and handing them to people around town.

He is also a talented artist and sells his work through Florida’s yearly Bonita Springs Art
Festival.

His love of baking came after Edith took him to a German bread 
baker in Florida.

Because of his enthusiasm for the process of baking she enrolled him in classes who 
were accommodating of his autism.

Now, 
Billy cooks most of his own meals.

Heart-Felt Plea: Billy Pagoni is hoping the top man hears his request

'He really wants something a little more than that, where he can take a 
vocational skill as a prep chef or a sous chef,' said Edith

However with Billy one year away from graduation he can not find a college that will 
accept him.

Applying to multiple institutions in the Naples
area Billy has been denied from
every one.

'They tell me there’s no place for him,' Edith said.

'He goes to school
every day, he gets A’s in a specialized curriculum, but he’s being 
denied a post-secondary experience.'

According to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, one in 88 children in the U.S. have been identified
with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

When Billy was first diagnosed, nearly 18 years ago, the
rate was two in 10,000.
