Motorists on a busy dual carriageway faced lengthy delays after an unusual accident led to the road being blocked by a car-sized boulder.

The huge lump of stone fell from the back of a transporter lorry after it entered the A303 near South Petherton, Somerset, from a roundabout at rush hour.

It tumbled off the truck and landed in the middle of the road, causing traffic chaos for drivers on their way home from work.

Boulder: The road was closed for more than an hour, causing traffic chaos

Luckily there were no cars travelling close to the HGV at the time, preventing a serious accident.

The strange incident happened at around 5pm yesterday.

Officers from Avon and Somerset Police arrived at the scene and managed to deal with the situation as the boulder sat in the middle of the dual carriageway.

The road was shut for more than an hour with the boulder eventually removed at around 7pm.

A man who saw the unusual scene said it looked as if a giant had simply dropped it in the road

Inconvenience: The boulder fell at rush hour, causing traffic tailbacks

Clive Hearn, 38, from Wellington, Somerset, was driving on the A303 when he came across the huge rock.

He said: 'The boulder was massive, just sat there in the middle of the road making everyone's trip home an absolute nightmare.

'It was such a bizarre sight, it looked as if a giant had just picked it up and placed it there.'

A spokesman from Avon and Somerset Police said the lorry driver had contacted them as soon as the rock fell and no criminal investigation was underway.

Luckily there was no vehicle behind the lorry when the rock fell
