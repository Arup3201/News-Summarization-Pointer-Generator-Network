A mother and daughter were found dead in their Orlando home Thursday after four men broke into their house following a crime spree.

Four suspects were arrested Friday for the crime spree that started with a pawn shop robbery, led to a shootout with a police officer, and ended with the killings of Patricia Moran, 72, and her 51-year-old daughter, Deborah Royal.

Michael Gordon, 34, was charged Friday with two counts of first-degree murder. He also was charged with armed robbery and attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, along with 22-year-old Devonere McCune, 25-year-old Jovan Lamb and 29-year-old Terrell Williams.

Detectives were still determining if there was a prior relationship between the suspect and the two murder victims.

'We don't know yet,' Polk County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Carrie Horstman said in an email.

Grady Judd, Polk County sheriff, did not give details of how the women were killed in a news conference Friday but said they were 'viciously murdered' in a manner 'much too graphic to describe,' ABC News reports.  

The crime spree began Thursday evening with a robbery at an Auburndale pawn shop. Witnesses reported that three men wearing hoodies robbed the store while one man waited outside in a red GMC Jimmy.

Judd said the robbery was 'well thought out and well designed.'

'It was designed to create the maximum terrorism of the people in the store.,' Judd said in a news conference Friday. 

'It was created to obtain not only their cooperation but take away any chance that they may fight back.'

An officer in nearby Haines City spotted the culprits' vehicle and attempted to pull it over as the suspects opened fire through the windows. The officer was not injured. 

The vehicle eventually became stuck in some sand and all four men ran. Authorities caught up with McCune when he was bitten by a Sheriff's Office K-9.

A short time later, officers learned from a resident about suspicious activity at a neighbor's house.

The neighbor told authorities that she heard women screaming 'no' repeatedly from inside the home, the Orlando Sentinel reports.  

When authorities surrounded the house, a blue car came barreling out of the garage, straight at them. 

Judd said officers fired 'many times.' 

The vehicle went a short distance before it also got stuck in sand. Gordon was the only person in the car and he was arrested. He suffered gunshot wounds and bites from a K-9. His injuries were not life-threatening.

Officers then found the bodies of Moran and Royal inside the house.

'Viciously Murdered:' Grady Judd, Polk County sheriff, did not give details of how the women were killed in a news conference Friday but said they were 'viciously murdered' in a manner 'much too graphic to describe'

Later Friday morning, authorities arrested Lamb and Williams.

Before all the suspects were taken into custody, deputies were knocking on doors in the neighborhood, checking on residents and urging them to call 911 if they saw anything suspicious.

'Don't start shooting through your front door,' Judd said at a late night news conference. 'That wouldn't be good.'

All of the men have long criminal histories, the Sentinel reports, with each racking up multiple charges ranging from armed robbery to drug possession and, now, murder or attempted murder. 

The Polk County Sheriff's Office, the Auburndale Police Department, and the Haines City Police Department are investigating the crime spree.

The Daily Ridge reports that authorities were called to a vacant house in reference to a shooting that may have involved the four men just minutes before the pawn shop robbery.
