Indianapolis Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson has been arrested for punching a pizza delivery guy in the face and the back of the head during an argument over a parking space, police have said.

The 31-year-old football player was arrested on a misdemeanor assault charge after the dispute around 8pm in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday.

The pizza delivery worker told Jackson he was going to use the space on 12th Street NW momentarily, but Jackson allegedly became angry, according to ABC7.

He told the man to 'get the [expletive] out of' his parking space before punching the driver in his face and on the back of his head, according to the police report.

By his side: Jackson, pictured with his girlfriend Christina, allegedly punched the man after becoming angry that he wanted to momentarily take his space. He was taken into custody and released Tuesday night

Jackson was released on Tuesday night but will have to return to court at a future date. 

On Wednesday the Colts released a statement. 

'The Indianapolis Colts have been made aware that D'Qwell Jackson was charged yesterday in Washington, DC with a count of simple assault,' it said. 'When the Club learns more of the surrounding facts, it will make an appropriate statement.'

In just the last month, two other Colts have been arrested.

Backup linebacker Josh McNary was charged with rape and has been placed on the commissioner's exempt list pending the outcome of his case.

Linebacker Andrew Jackson was also arrested for DUI last month and pleaded guilty later that day. 

D'Qwell Jackson played for the University of Maryland before being selected by the Cleveland Browns in the second round of the 2006 NFL draft.

Scene: He allegedly punched the man on this Washington D.C. street. He lives in the city in the off-season

He played for the team through the 2013 season and was signed by the Colts - in a four-year, $22 million contract - as a free agent in March 2014.

Most recently, he intercepted a Tom Brady pass in the AFC Championship Game, which led to the NFL's probe into whether the Patriots' balls had been under-inflated, in what became known as 'deflategate'.

Newsday reported that the investigation was sparked when Jackson gave the ball to a member of the Colts' equipment staff, who noticed it was not fully inflated.
