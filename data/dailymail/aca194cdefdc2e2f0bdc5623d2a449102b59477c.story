The nephew of former Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home shot himself dead after becoming depressed about his work as a racing journalist, a coroner heard.

James Douglas-Home, known to friends and family as Jamie, was found dead in the bedroom of his large country home by his sister, Sarah Dent.

An inquest yesterday heard that the former racehorse trainer, who held the title the 28th Baron Dacre, had struggled with depression for two months and had been prescribed medication after seeing his GP and a consultant psychiatrist.

Tragedy: Mr Douglas-Home's body was discovered by his sister Sarah at his property in Lockinge, Oxfordshire

Mr Douglas-Home, aged 61 years, whose wife Christine died in 2008, had refused an offer to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital the day before he shot himself, telling a doctor and his daughter he did not feel suicidal and preferred to remain at home.

His uncle, Sir Alec, was the 14th Earl of Home and succeeded Harold Macmillan as Prime Minister in October 1963.

His father, William, was also a politician and a playwright.

He had trained horses in the 1970s and 1980s and wrote a book entitled Horse Racing in Berkshire and numerous magazine articles on the subject.

Peter Clark, assistant coroner for Oxfordshire, read evidence from Dr Andrew Allen, Mr Douglas- Home’s GP, which said that the racing journalist had reported feeling tired and suffering from a lack of drive during three appointments in March.

'He admitted some concerns about a new book he was writing, which might take a year to research,' said Mr Clark. 'He was concerned he might not be up to it.'

Mr Douglas-Home was referred to another GP, Dr Simon Moore, in April and told him he had been 'down in the last two months.'

Dr Moore said in a statement: 'He had some thoughts about death but told me he would never actually contemplate doing this.'

He was prescribed sleeping tablets and Escitalopram for anxiety after being diagnosed with 'acute depression.'

On May 7, Mr Douglas-Home attended the Capio Nightingale Hospital in London with his daughter Emily.

Dr Christopher Muller-Pollard, consultant psychiatrist, told the inquest in Oxford that he had been happy and busy with varied work up until Christmas, but this had slowed in February and March.

'He had been commissioned to write a book on horse racing shortly after Christmas and been paid a portion of his fee in advance and was feeling anxiety about being able to fulfil that brief,' he said.

'He told me he was feeling suicidal two days prior to his appointment with me but was no longer feeling suicidal.

'I explained that some anti-depressant medicine could rarely cause an increase in suicidality, but that was more in young people and women.'

Dr Muller-Pollard reserved a bed at the hospital and told Mr Douglas-Home it would mean he could 'take a break' for a while, but he refused.

'Jamie reassured me he didn’t need any supervision as he was not currently suicidal. He would prefer to go home,' he said.

The inquest heard that, after this was explained to his daughter Emily, Mr Douglas-Home stayed at her home in London that night and appeared well.

The next day, Thursday, May 8, he returned to his home in Park Lane, East Lockinge, Wantage, Oxfordshire, and spoke to family friend Penelope Enthoven when she returned his two dogs at 12.30pm.

'I recalled him saying words to the effect of "Let me say thank you, you’ve been amazing throughout all this",' she said.

Mrs Dent had been due to stay with her brother at his home of 25 years that night and arrived at Didcot train station at 4.50pm, expecting him to pick her up.

'When I arrived and did not see my brother I thought that was strange as he was usually very punctual,' said Mrs Dent, who lives in Ireland.

She tried to call his mobile phone and landline several times but got no answer. Concerned, she took a taxi to his home, arriving at 6.30pm.

The deceased's father was British playwright William Douglas-Home, left, and his cousin's daughters are Lady Mary and Lady Iona, right, friends of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

She asked the driver, David Craske, to wait as she entered the house through the back door.

'I went upstairs and straight into the bedroom. As soon as I entered I saw Jamie laying there on the bed,' said Mrs Dent.

'It appeared he had shot himself because of the blood all over the bed and wall.'

She ran out to Mr Craske, who called the police. Mr Douglas-Home was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. Police found no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement. The shotgun used was one of two legally owned by Mr Douglas-Home.

A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the head.

Mrs Dent told the inquest her brother had mentioned he had felt worse after starting his medication and questioned the logic of leaving the decision of whether to admit her brother with him, due to his indecisiveness and mental state.

Mr Clark said: 'His apparent preference was to return home.

'It is clear from the statements that there is this issue that you feel slightly worse before you are meant to feel better, which is a very difficult judgement call to make.'

Mr Clark recorded a verdict of suicide, adding that the 'catastrophic method' chosen indicated no desire to be discovered and helped.
