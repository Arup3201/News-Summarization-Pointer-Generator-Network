The bells of St John's Church have been ringing since the first half of the 18th century, when German composer Handel donated them in exchange for the church's organ. 

They have been a part of daily life in Keynsham near Bristol, ever since, but they may be silenced after almost 300 years, because one person thinks they are too noisy.

A petition by local residents urging the church to keep the bells playing has prompted talks between the frustrated resident and the vicar of the 13th century Anglican church, Reverend Stephen M’Caw.

Threat of silence: The bells of St John's Church in Keynsham near Bristol may be forced to stop ringing after one resident complained that they are too noisy

Historic: The church had an organ when it was built in 1250, but German-born composer Handel swapped it in the 18th century for a peal of bells because he liked the 'mellow tones' 

The  Grade II listed church was built in 1250 and had an organ until Handel, a Baroque composer famous for his operas and oratorios, is said to have swapped it for a peal of bells in the 18th century - simply because he liked its mellow tones .

Some of the bells were made by the Bilbie family from nearby Chew Stoke.

An inscription on the smallest bell says: 'I value not who doth me see, For Thomas Bilbie casted me, Althow my sound it is but small, I can be heard among you all.'

The petition against the single complaint, which is growing strength, asks the church to take 'no action'.

It describes the bells as 'a valued local tradition and need to be retained to reach the proposed extensions to the town'.

Reverernd M'Caw, who wants to come to an agreement with the aggrieved party, said: 'At the end of the day, we want to be good neighbours to everyone. There is a wonderful community spirit here in Keynsham' he said.

'Our churches are a key part of it and celebrating and enhancing that spirit is very important to us.'

Campaigner, Nick Dewfall, 52, a sports coach, said: 'I’ve lived in Keynsham most of my life and everyone I’ve spoken to likes the bells regardless of whether they go to church or not.

'The church is 700 years old so bell ringing isn’t new and tends to have a positive association, plus the bells aren’t constantly ringing.'

Fed up: The complaint is said to have been made in the Old Vicarage Green, which is 300m away

The complainer is said to live near the church in Old Vicarage Green, a development of retirement flats 300m away from the church.

But none of the occupants spoken to have owned up to being the voice of protest.

Pam Redwood, 67, who has lived there for 14 years, said the place used to have a 'nice community spirit' but recently people had started to disagree over things like parking.

She added: 'Don’t buy a house near the church if you don’t like the bells, simple as that.'

Bernadette White, 69, said: 'They used to go off a lot more - before I even got up in the morning - but they haven’t as much for the last few week since somebody complained.

'If they were right on top of me I might feel differently, but I don’t mind them at all.'

Campaign: Around 70 local residents have signed a petition urging for the church not to take action 

Retired Edward Kirkland, 67, added: 'Surely there are more important things in this world to worry about than church bells.

'They are lovely. They don’t just ring them, they play hymns and songs and they really are lovely. I don’t see why they should stop because one person complains.' 

Bath and North East Somerset Council said its environmental health department had not received any complaint about the bells.

Two years ago church leaders at the All Saints’ Church, in Wrington, North Somerset, 17 miles away were given a noise abatement notice after a newcomer complained about their bells.

Reverend Nicholas Maddock was told by North Somerset Council environmental health officers not to switch off bells between 11pm and 7am or face prosecution.

The switching off caused fury among residents, many of whom said they relied on the chimes to know the time. 

Messiah composer: George Frideric Handel 

George Frideric Handel was born in Germany in 1685 and, despite being told not to meddle with instruments by his father, he developed a propensity for music in his childhood. 

In 1712, he decided to settle permanently in Britain following a number of visits and popular performances.

He then became a naturalised British subject, with the backing of Queen Anne, in 1727 and would go on to complete one of his most famous compositions, Messiah, in London in 1742. 

When he arrived, he travelled around the country, visiting various schools and churches, including St John's in Keynsham, to perform his oratorios or simply listen to music. 

But his time in Britain was mainly based on writing Italian opera for the British stage, which came with a mixed success.

Between 1711 and 1739, more than 25 of Handel's operas were premiered in the Haymarket (now the Her Majesty's) theatre.

But after losing money on his productions, he turned his attention to oratorios, an area where he had already received royal approval.   

One of his four Coronation Anthems, Zadok the Priest (1727), composed for the coronation of George II of Great Britain, has been performed at every subsequent British coronation, traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. 

Handel composed more than forty operas in over thirty years, and since the late 1960s, with the revival of baroque music and historically informed musical performance, interest in Handel's operas has grown.

After his death in 1759, he was buried in Westminster Abbey. 

Talks: Reverend Stephen M'Caw , who is believed to be setting up a meeting with the frustrated resident, said: 'At the end of the day, we want to be good neighbours to everyone'
