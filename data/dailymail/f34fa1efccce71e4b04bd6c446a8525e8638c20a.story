Traffic wardens gave out one ticket every four seconds last year, earning £255million for councils.

Some 7.8million penalty charge notices were left on windscreens in 2013, according to information obtained under Freedom of Information laws.

Experts warn the number of fines is likely to rise even higher unless councils refrain from hitting drivers with ‘opportunistic’ penalties.

And the figures could be underestimated as only 187 of 435 UK councils responded to the Freedom of Information request by Churchill Car Insurance – meaning some may be hiding that they are among the top earners.

The data showed the average number
 of Penalty Charge Notices issued per council was more than 23,000, 
while one in 15 parking fines were successfully challenged.

The research by the company also found Westminster City Council issued the equivalent of more than four PCNs per resident last year - 455,000 in total, worth £24million.

Outside of the capital, Cardiff Council issued the highest number of parking fines at 57,000 and North Somerset Council generated the most revenue at £2.25million.

In addition, the number of tickets issued by councils fell by only 1.5 per cent between 2012 and 2013 - despite pleas from Communities Secretary Eric Pickles for them to sharply cut down this figure.

In some councils the figures actually rose - with St Edmundsbury Borough Council in Suffolk hitting motorists with 9,442 tickets last year, compared to 1,652 in 2012 - a rise of 472 per cent.

Meanwhile, there were also increases 
seen at Runnymede Borough Council in Surrey and Kingston Council in 
south-west London of 55 and 29 per cent respectively, reported The 
Sunday Times.

Mr Pickles, 61, 
said last year: ‘Local authorities should not use parking as a tax or 
cash cow, and we are currently looking into the potentially illegal use 
of councils’ parking contracts.’

While councils keep the cash raised from penalty notices, it must be spent on transport-related work. Most car parking penalties are £40 or £60, with ‘on the road’ offences coming in at £50 or £70.

Steve Barrett, head of car insurance at Churchill, said: ‘Parking regulations are a hugely important part of keeping roads safe and clear, but it’s also essential that fines are fair and proportionate.

'There is a fine line between fair and opportunistic that councils shouldn’t be tempted to cross'

Steve Barrett, Churchill

‘In many areas, parking restrictions can be confusing and appear inconsistent, so we’d urge motorists to be vigilant when parking their vehicles to avoid hefty fines.

‘The capital is extremely congested so we’d expect to see a higher number of restrictions in place and penalties being issued. However, there is a fine line between fair and opportunistic that councils shouldn’t be tempted to cross.’

Some 187 of the 435 councils contacted by Churchill, which is part of the Direct Line group, replied to the Freedom of Information requests they were sent.

The following data shows 2013 figures for councils which responded to Churchill's requests:
