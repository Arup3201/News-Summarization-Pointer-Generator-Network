It is the fast food chain famous for its Happy Meals and 'I'm lovin' it' slogan. 

But a disabled pensioner was left furious when he was fined £200 for falling asleep in a McDonald's car park, after buying a Happy Meal. 

John Colliver, 71, from Caerphilly, who used to think of himself as McDonald’s most loyal customer, has now switched allegiance to rivals Burger King.

Not lovin' it: Pensioner John Colliver, 71, was fined £200 for falling asleep at the McDonald's car park in Blackwood, South Wales (pictured) after buying an early morning Happy Meal 

Mr Colliver, who runs an animal sanctuary from his small farm, dozed off in his car after treating himself to a 5am Happy Meal at the McDonald's in Blackwood, South Wales on April 4.

But he later received a £100 fined for overstaying the 90 minute maximum free parking. 

The furious pensioner - who would visit McDonalds six times a week - refused to pay and the fine was doubled with McDonald's citing 'court costs'. 

Mr Colliver, who has diabetes, said: 'I bought a Happy Meal – a burger, chips and white coffee – and after eating it, I sat in my car listening to Classic FM and dozed off.

'I often get up early when I’ve got a lot of work on and would have an early meal because it’s good value and sets me up for the rest of the day.

'I thought I had just dropped off for a minute, I do that in the car when it’s hot. It’s not until the fine dropped on my mat at home that I even knew about it.'

He added: 'I’d been working long days at the sanctuary and when I get in the warm after eating I can fall asleep.

'But this feels like victimisation. I was probably the most loyal customer McDonald’s ever had. I used to eat there five or six time a week, spend up to £50, and sometimes call in twice a day.

Snubbed: Mr Colliver, formerly a loyal McDonald's customer, was given the fine for falling asleep in a car park

The 71-year-old said he was now boycotting McDonald's because of his treatment.

'I eat at the town’s Burger King now,' he said.

'Wanting me to pay £200 for a Happy Meal, that’s got to be the most expensive burger and chips in the world.

'I’m a pensioner, I can’t afford that sort of money. I used McDonald’s because it was cheap and I like the food. If I did pay it I couldn’t go back there, I’d choke on my chips. 

It is unclear whether he is still liable to pay the extra £100 court costs added to the amount.

In response, a spokesman for McDonald’s said Mr Colliver had failed to respond to earlier notifications or make a formal appeal within the time necessary.

However, the firm said it had since cleared his fine.

It is unclear whether he is still liable to pay the extra £100 court costs added to the amount. 

A spokesman for the company said: 'In instances where a customer feels that a Parking Charge Notice has been issued in error, we ask that they follow the procedure outlined by the ticket issuer to make an appeal.

'It is with regret that in this case the customer did not appeal the charge notice and did not respond on the several occasions he was sent notifications by the ticket issuer on this matter.

'We were therefore unaware of his case until court action had been taken.

“The fine has since been cleared and we have informed the customer that should the situation arise again he must contact the ticket issuer to appeal it.'

ParkingEye Limited, which runs the car park in question, was unavailable for comment.
