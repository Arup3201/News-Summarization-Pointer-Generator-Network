A law graduate is accused of strangling a woman into a 'stupor' with 50 Shades Of Grey-style BDSM toys in his Manhattan apartment.

Ryan Hemphill, 33, was arrested in April 2013 after his alleged victim 'lost consciousness', the New York Post reports.

According to the paper, police discovered 'a baton sword, daggers and sheaths' as well as masks, handcuffs and metal materials in his Murray Hill property.

Ryan Hemphill, 33, is accused of using 50 Shades Of Grey-style equipment to strangle a woman 

Hemphill, who attended Hofstra University School of Law in New York before working as a legal advisor, will appear before a judge next month, according to Manhattan court records.

He has been charged with second-degree strangulation, menacing, criminal obstruction of breathing and weapon possession, the Post reported.

A document read by the paper says the victim was left with cuts on her mouth and bruises to her wrist and elbow.

He is accused of saying 'if you don't leave I will slit your throat' as he held a knife to her neck, the paper reports.
