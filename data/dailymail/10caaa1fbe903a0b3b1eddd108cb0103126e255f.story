Pro basketball’s first openly-gay player has yet to be signed by an NBA team.

No NBA team has signed Jason Collins, 34, despite a solid 12 year career spent with six different teams, most recently the Boston Celtics, and he doesn't understand why.

The seven-foot-tall center told the New York Times that three teams have contacted his agent, but ultimately went in a different direction. He will not consider playing in Europe, he said.

Mr Collins announced his sexuality in the May 6 issue of Sports Illustrated, on the cover.

‘I'm a 34-year-old NBA center,’ he wrote. ‘I'm black. And I'm gay.’

A free agent at the time, there were some grumblings Mr Collins might not be signed by an NBA team by the beginning of this season.

Training camps have opened, but the respected player is without a team.

Despite championship experience at every level he’s played – two state championships in high school, the NCAA’s Final Four and two NBA Finals across nine playoff appearances – many worry he will not suit up again.

At 34, the Los Angeles native is no longer in the prime of his career. Though considered a reliable bench presence, his career statistics of 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds per game are hardly earth shattering.

As a 21-year veteran, Mr Collins can not sign for any less than just under $1.4million, per the contract agreed upon between the player’s union and team owners. Younger players with upside potential can be had for less.

But is that the only reason?

‘You don’t want to speculate — I don’t go there,’ Mr Collins said to the Times. Admitting that his name isn’t going to be the first called off any team’s bench, he still doesn’t understand why he isn’t on an NBA roster.

‘I feel there are players in the league right now that, quite frankly, I’m better than,’ he added.

One of the teams that kicked the tires on Mr Collins, the Detroit Pistons, ended up signing third-year player Josh Harrelson for $900,000, he told the Times.

Other teams, including the Brooklyn Nets, for whom he played when they were still in New Jersey, were also considered landing spots, the Times noted, but luxury cap penalties this year made that impossibility.

Despite having previously played with current Nets coach Jason Kidd, any contract he could sign would be penalized at four times his salary because it would put the Nets over the league salary cap, the Times explained.

‘It shouldn’t be about that,’ Mr Collins told the Times. ‘The N.B.A. is for the best players, not for the most affordable players.’

The league office told the paper it does not feel the former Atlanta Hawk, he played three seasons for the team, is unsigned because he is gay – one team official disagreed though.

‘Some teams just might not want to deal with it because of the media implications,’ a general manager who refused to be named told the paper, echoing comments about the circus surrounding NFL player Tim Tebow’s every move with both the Denver Broncos and New York Jets.

Many feel Jason Collins being on the court after coming out is just as important as him going public about his sexuality.

‘I do think it’s important for him to be in the league as a visible symbol,’ activist Richard Lapchick told the Times. ‘If he makes this courageous stand but then disappears from the locker room, it would not do it justice.’

Mr Lapchick did acknowledge to the paper that the new salary cap penalties may make it difficult for Mr Collins to find a fit.

‘The decision to sign him rests with individual team owners’ gay athlete advocate Hudson Taylor said to the Times, ‘one of them has to step up.’

Former Boston Celtics Coach Doc Rivers, now at the helm of the Los Angeles Clippers, is open to signing the veteran big man – but only as an insurance policy should one of his guys go down with an injury.

‘Let me put it this way: if one of my bigs goes down and he’s not signed, I’m signing him,’ said Mr Rivers. ‘I’m not signing him because he’s gay. I’m not signing him because it’s a story and it brings us attention.’

‘I’m signing him because he has a value to help us win,’ the coach added, ‘I do have the advantage that I coached him, and I know what type of guy he is, how tough he is.’

Despite having no roster to call home, Mr Collins remains upbeat.

‘This is not an unprecedented situation, as far as being a veteran and not joining a team until later in the season,’ Collins told the paper. ‘So there are a lot of ways that this can play out.’

Asked whether he would consider playing abroad, as many fringe players do, Mr Collins immediately shot down the notion.

‘’I’m an N.B.A. player. I want to play in the N.B.A,’ he told the Times. ‘I just have to stay in this mode of handling this test, of having patience. You know, I have faced worse in my life.’

It remains to be seen whether he will be signed by an NBA team this season, anything can happen. Kenyon Martin signed with the New York Knicks so late last season he only played 18 games – but played an integral role.

Already wealthy from his playing career, Mr Collins does not need to worry about money. As he wrote in Sports Illustrated, he just wants to play the game.

‘I've reached that enviable state in life in which I can do pretty much what I want. And what I want is to continue to play basketball. ‘
