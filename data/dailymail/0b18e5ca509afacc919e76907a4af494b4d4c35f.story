The new boss of Royal Bank of Scotland has promised to ‘obsess about customers all day every day’ in a rousing speech to his staff.

Describing his ‘high level of trepidation’ at taking on one of the toughest corporate jobs in Britain, Ross McEwan acknowledged that the bank can be ‘too hard’ to do business with, and promised to ‘make it easier’ for customers to work with the bank.

His comments were widely interpreted as a hint that the bank would do more to offer much-needed loans to the country’s struggling small firms - something his predecessor Stephen Hester was heavily criticised for failing to do.

Addressing 300 staff at the bank’s offices in London, the 56 year old New Zealander pledged to create a bank ‘known for exceptional customer service and not for failure’.

He added he would repay British taxpayers for the ‘money and faith they have put in us’.

‘I’m delighted to have the role and slightly fearful of the task I’ve taken on board, which I suspect is a good thing,’ he said.

‘I look forward to being your leader as we change this organisation and refocus it so we obsess all day every day about our customers.’

Addressing criticism of the bank’s lending record, he said: ‘We know sometimes we make it too hard for our customers to do business with us.

‘My aim is to make RBS one of the easiest banks to do business with.’

Last night MPs applauded the comments and urged Mr McEwan to ‘to turn RBS into an engine room’ for UK plc’.

Mr McEwan was poached by RBS from Commonwealth Bank of Australia last Summer to run its retail bank.

The retail banking credentials of the little known Kiwi meant he was regarded as a front runner to replace Hester, who was ousted in June.

RBS has been mired in a string of scandals since it received a £46 billion bail-out from British taxpayers in 2008 and 2009.

Earlier this year it was fined £290 million by UK and US authorities for rigging crucial Libor interest rates. So far it has been forced to put aside £2.2 billion compensation for mis-selling payment protection insurance.

RBS has also been widely criticised for failing to lend enough to small businesses.

Mr McEwan, who arrived at the 250 Bishopsgate offices at 7.15am yesterday, paid tribute to Hester for his ‘remarkable achievement’ in putting a bank ‘which stood on the brink of collapse’ onto a stable footing.

Mr Hester has been criticised for being out of touch with the public - particularly over pay as he initally refused to give up his bonuses.

Photos of him resplendent in hunting gear or jogging around Hyde Park have proved an irritation.

But at his leaving dinner last week, Mr Hester showed he has sense of humour, handing a riding hat to Mr McEwan as a gift.

In a bid to avoid the rows over fat cat pay that dogged his predecessor Mr McEwan has already announced that he will forfeit his annual bonus worth up to £2m illion until 2015.

But he will still pocket a basic package of more than £1.3 million in 2014 and up to £3million in long term share awards which could pay out in 2017.

Mr McEwan becomes the just the latest new bank boss to promise sweeping change.

Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins has ordered staff to sign up to five ‘core values’ including respect and integrity as part of an overhaul of its culture.

Chris Leslie, shadow treasury minister said: ‘RBS now needs to start behaving like an engine room for UK plc. The time has come to focus on supporting growth.’ end Chris Leslie, shadow treasury minister said: ‘RBS now needs to start behaving like an engine room for UK plc.
