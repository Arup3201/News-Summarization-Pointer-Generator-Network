A nine-year-old boy has died after falling from a window while on holiday.

Tributes have been paid to tragic Matthew Hamer, who is thought to have died in the accident at the hotel where he was staying in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Matthew, of York, was a popular member of an under-nine’s cricket team.

His coach Alan Fletcher said: 'It is devastating news.

'Matthew was a good member of the under-nines team, he had been with us for three years and he was a smashing young lad.

'He never got up to any mischief, he listened to what he was told and got on with it. He tried really hard with his cricket and showed talent on the pitch.

'We understand he fell from a window or fire escape, though the detail is sketchy on precisely what happened.'

The Foreign Office confirmed a British national had died in Kuala Lumpur but said it could not give further information as the death involved a child.

Matthew’s mother Jane and father Keith, a university lecturer, are understood to still be in Malaysia.

Neighbour Paul Burland, 46, said: 'We are going to miss him terribly. He was a lovely, friendly active boy. He was a close friend to our children, we are all very sad.'
