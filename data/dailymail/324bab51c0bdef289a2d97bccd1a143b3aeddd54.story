Tottenham progress 5-1 on aggregate following a 3-0 home victory.

Mauricio Pochettino's men gave a professional performance and progress to the next stage of the competition.

Hull's European adventure over before it really began as the Tigers crash out on away goals.

A valiant effort from last season's FA C up finalists - winners on the night but out on away goals.

85 mins: 18-year-old defender Veljkovic comes on for the final few minutes of the game.

The winger hit a terrific strike towards goal which looked destined for the roof of the net but Romero in the Limassol goal did well to tip over. 

Plain sailing for Tottenham.

77 mins: Sandro has played well this evening and is replaced by Holtby.

Leading 2-1, as it stands Hull will go OUT of the Europa League on aggregate as Lokeren have that vital away goal.

64 mins: Andros Townsend scores from the spot!

60 mins: Paulinho with another good touch - the Brazilian has been tidy tonight - to take the ball away from the onrushing goalkeeper on the edge of the area before laying it off to Aaron Lennon who dinks the ball towards goal but it is cleared on the line by Carlitos.

Unlucky, would have been a great goal.

48mins: Spurs have made a hell of a start to this second half, continual pressure on the AEL goal, and it's rewarded when Paulinho scores. The Brazilian burst into the box down the right-hand channel, and slotted home beautifully across the keeper. 

It's all kicking off here! Hull are right back in this, as Robbie Brady bags his second of the night, sending the keeper the wrong way.

An Elmohamady cross strikes a Lokeren hand, and the referee points to the spot. Big call and a big chance for Hull.

49 mins: Disaster for Hull City at the start of the second half. A Lokeren corner isn't cleared properly, and it falls to Jordan Remacle. The Lokeren man smashes it into the top corner past McGregor. 

City now need AT LEAST two goals to go through. One would see them go out on away goals. 

Everyone's favourite charitable craze of the moment got a run out at half time here. Tottenham's mascot Chirpy gets a bucket of ice cold water poured over his head. That'll be an uncomfortable second half.

Incidentlly he nominated Children in Need's Pudsey. These mascots stick together don't they!

Craig Hope at the KC Stadium: You get the feeling the next goal will decide this one. Lokeren were by far the better side for the remainder of the opening half following Brady’s early breakthrough.

They’re bright on the ball, the man in possession always has an option and, in Vanaken and Dutra, they boast a front pair not afraid to take aim. ‘Delicately poised’ is what any half-decent commentator would be trotting out now, were it on TV, that is.

So, Tottenham and Hull both lead at half-time.

Spurs look to be on their way to qualifying for the Europa League for the fourth successive season European compeition in succession while Hull are level with Lokeren on aggregate.

Should the Tigers concede a nasty away goal, Steve Bruce's men will need to win by two goals on the night.

45 mins: Paulinho does excellently to dispossess Limassol in their own half before sliding in Harry Kane who places the ball into the corner of the net. Cool finish by the young striker.

Tottenham have been pressng high all half and finally forced Limassol into a mistake.

Spurs now lead 3-1 on aggregate.

Seven minutes of injury time to be played following Fegrouche's nasty injury while at Hull, the referee blows for half-time.

41 mins: Limassol's Brazilian is booked for a foul on Tottenham wideman Andros Townsend.

The referee pointed to three different areas of the pitch - looks like that's a warning for a number of fouls by Bebe.

Craig Hope from the KC Stadium: 6 mins - Steve Bruce said Hull could do with an early goal and that’s exactly what they’ve got. Lokeren goalkeeper Jerry Verhulst was their hero seven days ago but he hardly covered himself in glory with the hesitancy which allowed Robbie Brady to steal in for an easy opener.

This tie is still level, remember, and Hull will need at least one more before they’re planning trips to the San Siro.

11 mins: Kane fires the ball straight down the middle but Romero, called into action immediately after coming on to replace Fegrouche, saves with his leg.

What a start! It remains 2-1 to Tottenham on aggregate.

10 mins: Long delay here at the Lane while Fegrouche gets treatment following the decision to award a penalty. Surprised the keeper only gets a yellow. Felt it was a red.

Fegrouche will play no further part as the stopper is stretchered off the field.

3 mins: Kyle Naughton is hauled down by the AEL Limassol goalkeeper and a penalty is awarded to Spurs.

However, Kerim Fegrouche took a whack to the face and is down receiving treatment. 

So, the next ninety minutes or so will decide whether Hull and Tottenham are in the hat for tomorrow's draw.

As mentioned previously, Everton, who finished fifth last term, have gone straight into the group stage without having to qualify.

Those teams, like the Toffees, who already have their places in the group stage assured include: Last season's winners Sevilla, Fiorentina, Wolfsburg, Dynamo Kiev and Lille.

Celtic and Rafael Benitez's Napoli will also compete in this season's tournament following their elimination from the Champions League via the play-offs this week.

As it's Hull's maiden voyage into Europe, supporters won't be too fussy about who the Tigers line up against should they progress this evening.

Meanwhile for Spurs, a European jaunt is often an annual occurence and Mauricio Pochettino's men will be fancied to go quite far in this year's competition.

McGregor, Figueroa, Rosenior, Chester, Davies, Elmohamady, Meyler, Livermore, Brady, Aluko, Sagbo.

Lloris, Naughton, Vlad, Kaboul, Davies, Dembele, Sandro, Paulinho, Lennon, Townsend, Kane.

Can Tottenham and Hull join Premier League rivals Everton in Friday's draw group stage draw?

The Tigers will be desperate to progress in their first-ever foray into Europe while Spurs will be confident of maintaining their lead against Cypriots AEL Limassol.
