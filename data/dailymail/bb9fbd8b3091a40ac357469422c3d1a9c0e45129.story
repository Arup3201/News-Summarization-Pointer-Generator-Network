A rookie female firefighter - just 24 years old - was among the four first responders killed in a devastating blaze in a Houston hotel on Friday, which also saw another crew member lose both his legs.

The Houston fire department team were heroically searching for survivors in the Southwest Inn - a hotel and restaurant which became overrun with flames just after noon - when the roof caved in.

Three firefighters were declared dead at the scene and another died in hospital. A further five were injured including one critically, who is said to have lost both legs.

Field reports indicate that the firefighters were caught in a roof collapse, said Jeff Caynon, president of the Houston Professional Fire Fighters Association.

'I don't know if that was folks outside next to the structure or inside when it collapsed, but the collapse is going to be the cause,' he said after visiting with firefighters at Memorial Hermann Hospital.
