Hand crafted out of ferro-cement and designed to look like a rock which follows the natural formation of the land, the Hollander House is on the market and looking for a new owner.

Built between 1969 and 1971, the quirky home on Newport Beach in New South Wales, is expected to fetch well into the million dollar range if property seekers can embrace the home's psychedelic vibe.

'We haven't actually created a house price, there has been a couple of projections in the press which have been... interesting. At this point we just have to see what the market dictates,' Director of Modern House estate agents, Marcus Lloyd-Jones told the Daily Mail Australia.

Despite there being no set house price and the estate agents waiting to see 'what the market dictates', the press has estimated it will go for aroun $1.5 million

He then added: 'It is worth a lot of money though. If you were to try and build that today, it would certainly be well over one and a half million. So then when you add in the land area, 904 square metres - well, you do the sum.'

Likening it to architectural designs by Barcelona's Antonio Gaudi, Modern House describes the property as being made up entirely of curves, columns and dome-shaped ceilings.

Designed by David Hollander as an 'organic' structure, each room is said to flow into the next in a natural way.

'The elliptical walls are not governed by mathematics but as the architect told a journalist in an interview as the house was nearing completion, "I chose curves which I thought were correct aesthetically",' the Modern House website states.

The director of Modern House estate agents, Marcus Lloyd-Jones hinted to the Daily Mail Australia that he expects selling price to far exceed $1.5 million

The house was designed by David Hollander and hand crafted out of ferro-cement reinforced with steel

'You can add a bit on a normally straight wall or take a bit off, and it won't really make that much difference to the rest of the plan. But with a house like this, altering one curve means everything is out!' David Hollander said of his design according to the property agent.

The current owner of the home, interior designer Nancy Renzi, has put a great amount of effort into bringing the home back to its originally intended design conditions.

She is the third owner of the home, buying it in 2011 for about $875,000 before stripping down everything and completely renovating it, from the floors and lighting to the gardens and even painting every one of the textured walls.

'I bought it as a project  - that was the intention all along, to restore it and reinvent it to its original design and when I finish I’d sell it and move along,' Ms Renzi said.

It's design is considered 'organic' in that it follows the natural formation of the land and looks as if it is 'growing out of the site', according to Modern House

Ms Renzi's additions to the home included an outdoor bath on the large private deck attached to the main bedroom as well as an entertaining deck attached to the kitchen which features an outdoor fireplace

'Shes actually added to that house in a very respectful fashion and I would say its added to its appeal,' Mr Lloyd-Jones said.

'She has brought it back and made it sing again and that's a special thing to have done.'

It's also not the first time that the property has made headlines, featuring in Australian House and Garden magazine in 1971, Vogue Australia in 1975 and even recently, the Sydney Morning Herald's Sunday Life this year.

It was also voted one of the top five houses of the year in 1973 in the Australian House and Garden magazine.

Mr Lloyd-Jones described the house as timeless, 'It feels as though it could have been built today and it will still feel modern in 30 years time'

'It's difficult to write about a house like this unless you've been inside, the recently published articles just don’t do it justice,' Mr Lloyd-Jones said.

'It's one of the most sublime spaces I've ever been in. It's beautiful, relaxing and invigorating - it's an extraordinary space.

'It feels as though it could have been built today and it will still feel modern in 30 years time, it's one of these unique pieces of architecture that truly is timeless.'
