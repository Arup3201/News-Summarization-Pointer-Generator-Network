A U.S. Marine who went into
the sea from a V-22 Osprey during a flight mishap over the
northern Gulf this week is the first American to be killed in U.S.
military operations against the Islamic State group in Iraq and
Syria.

Corporal Jordan Spears, 21, of Memphis, Indiana, was a
crewman aboard a V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft flying off the USS
Makin Island and went into the sea when the aircraft lost power
shortly after takeoff, the Navy said on Friday.

The V-22 descended to the surface of the ocean during the
mishap on Wednesday. 

Spears and a second air crewmen went into
the water when it appeared the tilt-rotor aircraft was about to
crash, but the two pilots were able to regain control of the
craft and landed it safely back on board the Makin Island.

One air crewman was recovered and was in stable condition
aboard the Makin Island. A search and rescue operation for the
missing crewman was called off on Thursday and the Navy said he
was presumed lost at sea.

Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary,
confirmed on Friday that the Marine's unit had been supporting
current operations in the Gulf, including the current battle
against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

'That squadron and that ship were in the Gulf supporting
Central Command operations,' Kirby said, referring to the
combatant command responsible for U.S. forces in the Middle East
region.

'Some of those operations included operations in Iraq and
Syria, at least tangentially,' he said.

'So there's no question
that this Marine's death is related to the operations that are
going on in some form or fashion.'

The Navy and Marine Corps are investigating the cause of the
mishap.

The V-22 takes off and lands vertically like a helicopter
but the twin rotors at the end of its wings tilt after takeoff
and allow it to fly like an airplane.

The V-22 had a rocky start because of mishaps during
development, but it has won kudos for performance since entering
into service.
