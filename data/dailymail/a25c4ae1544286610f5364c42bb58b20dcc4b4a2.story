Rebekah Brooks’s husband tried to hide a stash of pornography from police investigating the phone-hacking scandal, a court heard yesterday.

Charlie Brooks says he dumped a porn magazine called Lesbian Lovers and seven DVDs in a jiffy bag behind some bins on the day his home was raided by police following his wife’s arrest.

They were in bags allegedly taken away by Mrs Brooks’ security staff as the property was searched, and then later returned in a black bin liner.

Charlie and Rebekah Brooks deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by hiding material from police

CCTV footage of what the prosecution claim was an operation to hide hacking evidence was shown to the Old Bailey a day earlier.

The
 bin liner, which contained a brown leather bag and a black nylon one 
was found by a cleaner, who took them to his boss, facilities manager 
Alan Ramsay.

Giving 
evidence yesterday, the cleaner Fernando Nascimento said he remembered 
there was a computer in one of the bags and an iPad in the other.

The jiffy bag containing the pornography was hidden in the brown leather satchel.

The cleaner said he did not see any explicit material.

Jurors
 laughed yesterday as Neil Saunders QC, counsel for Brooks quipped: ‘If 
you had opened it, you would not have forgotten it because inside there 
was a magazine whose title was Lesbian Lovers.’

Brazilian cleaner Fernando Nascimento found two laptops and an iPad along with paperwork in two bags stuffed into a bin liner during his morning rounds emptying bins in the underground car park of the Brooks' London home, the court heard

Mr
 Nascimento replied: ‘I don’t understand English, the only thing I 
noticed were the computers.’ Mr Saunders joked: ‘There wasn’t much 
writing in the magazine.’

He added:  ‘I noticed there was a black bin liner 
behind one of the black bins.

‘I went around the car park to collect all the bins, and after that I went back to the bag.’

He
 added there were also seven DVDs in the bag, which was handed to the 
facilities manager on July 18 2011, the day after Rebekah Brooks was 
arrested.

Mr Ramsay said he had found a cheque book with the name ‘Mr and Mrs Brooks’ on it, so had an idea who the bags belonged to.

He
 said he contacted Charlie Brooks about the contents, but then decided 
to hand them to police given the ‘incidents of the day before’.

The
 facilities manager said Charlie Brooks told him the items had ‘been 
dropped off by a friend for him to collect and there had been some kind 
of mix-up’.

He added: 
‘But in the back of my mind was the incidents of the day before, which 
made me think twice about should I contact the police or return the 
property to the owner.

‘I
 decided to discuss with my officers various scenarios why the bag would
 have been found where it was just to try and understand if there was 
any rational explanation.’

Charlie
 Brooks came looking for the missing bags but security staff opted to 
call police instead of returning the possessions, the court heard.

The court later heard that Brooks 
came looking for the missing bags - but security staff opted to call 
police instead of returning the possessions.

Facilities
 manager Alan Ramsay said Brooks claimed there had been a 'mix-up' in 
the collection of the bags and was trying to find them.

But
 Mr Ramsay said he decided to call police rather than hand the bags back
 to the horse trainer because of the police searches the previous day.

'I had to make a decision whether to contact the owner of the property and return it', he said.

'But
 in the back of my mind was the incidents of the day before, which made 
me think twice about should I contact the police or return the property 
to the owner.

'I decided to discuss with my officers various scenarios why the bag would have been found where it was just to try and understand if there was any rational explanation.'

Mr Ramsay had been handed the bags by an employee, and had put them into secure storage.

He had found a cheque book with the name 'Mr and Mrs Brooks' on it, so had an idea who the bags belonged to.

He told the court a porter contacted him when Brooks came looking for the bags

'He said he had lost a couple of bags and he had spoken to a cleaner', he said.

'He said the cleaner had told him the bags had been found and handed in to our office, which was why he had approach me.'

Prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron said: 'You took his details and description of the missing bags, and you asked him about their whereabouts.'

Mr Ramsay replied: 'I asked him how they came to be in the car park.

'He said they had been placed behind the bins in the car park, dropped off by a friend for him to collect. There had been a some kind of mix-up.'

Brooks said the drop-off had been made at 8pm the previous evening.

Mr Ramsay told the court he called police at 1.40pm, around twenty minutes after speaking to Brooks.

Rebekah Brooks denies conspiring with others to hack phones.

She
 further denies two allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of 
justice – one with her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 49, and a
 second with her husband Charlie and Hanna. They also deny the charges.

The trial continues.
