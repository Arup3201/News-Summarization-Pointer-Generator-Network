An over-paying cash machine is such a rarity that to some it could feel like small windfall.

Devon Gluck, a student at the University of Delaware, thought it was his lucky day when a campus ATM made an error and dispensed $1,800.

Devon, who is originally from Ellicot City, Maryland, says he was making a withdrawal with his debit card at the start of February when he noticed the machine began making strange noises.

Then, he says, it suddenly spat out 18 crisp $100 bills.

Unexpected bonus: Devon Gluck made a withdrawal at his University of Delaware campus branch of PNC Bank. A faulty ATM gave him $1800 in $100 bills

Speaking to the The News Journal, Devon, who is studying finance, said he could do nothing but stare at his pay-out. 'My eyes just opened really wide, and I was like, ‘Oh my god, this is $1,800 right here, it’s pretty crazy.'

As an out-of-state student, Devon has to pay $27,500 a year in university tuition fees so he took the money initially to try and figure out what to do with it.

Friends told him that he should keep the money or spend it on a trip to England.

Four days later, Devon said that after speaking with his father he decided the right thing to do was to return the cash.

A manager at PNC bank thanked him for returning the money.

Dilemma: The senior finance major at the University of Delaware (pictured) stared at the cash. Devon took the money so he could think about what to do with it. He returned all of it four days later

Cash payout: Fees at the University of Delaware are $27,500 a year but being a economics student, Devon felt he could make better use of the cash by returning it to the bank and making a good contact for his future career

PNC spokeswoman Marcey Zwiebel could not comment on the details of the incident but did confirm that a student had returned money that had been dispensed by the ATM.

“Honesty is always the best policy when talking about money, and keeping money that you’re not authorized to have for any amount of time is unlawful,” Zwiebel said.
