Suspended 2000ft above the ground, a Georgia bride and groom were literally floating on air on their big day as they  tied the knot on a hot air balloon.

Sara and Joseph Stewart, from Canton, exchanged their vows during the unusual ceremony, watched by a single friend.

But it wasn't all plain sailing, as the loved-up pair had had to keep their unique choice of venue a secret until the last moment in case the flight was cancelled due to bad weather.

The unusual choice of venue also meant that Mrs Stewart's father was unable to be with them as they exchanged vows, although he did give his daughter away beforehand.

In the event, the only close friend to share the couple's magical moment was Leslie, a military chaplain who performed the ceremony.

Rather than sending their friends invitations to a wedding, the couple invited them to their house the following day to watch the  footage of the quirky ceremony and celebrate their marriage.

Mrs Stewart, a wedding photographer, came up with the idea after her new husband revealed he had planned to pop the question on a hot air balloon, but decided it was too expensive.

'In my line of work I had seen so many different weddings and I didn't want to copy anyone else's,' she says. 'I wanted to do something different.'

'I wanted to do something I had never seen before. Joey told me that he had thought about proposing to me on a hot air balloon, so then I came up with the idea of getting married in one. He thought it was an awesome idea.'

The couple married in August 2012 after dating for two years - but the soulmates had been friends since meeting during an American Football game at university in 2007.

'We got a lot of great reactions from our friends and family,' added the happy bride. 'I'm sure a lot of them thought we were weird for doing it, but I think after everyone watched the video they agreed that it was a pretty cool idea.

'We actually didn't tell them about the balloon because we weren't 100 per cent sure that we would be able to fly so we kept it a secret in case we needed to change plans.

'It really was the best day of my life. I loved when Joey was saying his vows to me because we were completely surrounded in a cloud of white. It was perfect, so still and beautiful.

'We started the ceremony on the ground so that my father could still give me away, and only immediate family came to see us fly. It was perfect.'
