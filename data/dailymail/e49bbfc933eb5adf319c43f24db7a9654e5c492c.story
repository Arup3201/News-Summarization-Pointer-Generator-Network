Police still searching for the parents of a Texas baby found abandoned in a Walmart bag are exploring whether her rare newborn tooth could help them track down her parents, they said today.

Chloe, who was named by hospital staff, was discovered by a dog walker abandoned outside an apartment block in Cypress on February 19.

Police have since tried to find the infant's parents and hope the tooth may prove a link to her family history according to ABC News.

An early or natal tooth is seen in 
just one in 2000 births and is an extra tooth which is either removed or
goes away before normal baby teeth arrive. 

Police believe Chloe's mother did not
receive pre-natal care which is why it is proving so difficult to track
her down but say they hope other relatives realize the tooth link and 
come forward.

Houston police previously released composite sketches of what Chloe's parents could look like in a bid to try and find them.

The
pastel renderings created by a forensic sketch artist depict a man and a
woman with facial features combining Chloe's traits, like her grey eyes
and thick dark hair.

The 
Harris County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that the portraits 
are based solely on Chloe's photo and not on the description of any 
possible witnesses.

Artist Lois Gibson did an age 
progression of what Chloe would look like as a young woman to deduce 
what her mother and father could look like.

‘It might just look half like one and half like the other,’ Gibson told the Houston Chronicle. 'I think I have a 50 per cent chance of the sketches looking more like one than the other.’

The artist conceded that such factors as weight gain, dyed hair and acne make the process less precise.

Gibson, who made it into the 2008 
Guinness Book of World Records as the World's Most Successful Forensic 
Artist, has created age progressions in other cases involving children, 
but never as young as Chloe.

It is believed Chloe, who weighed just four pounds and still had about three inches of umblical cord attached, was premature.

She was
naked, but her body temperature was normal, suggesting that she had not
been outside for a long time and someone had cleaned her up after the birth.

She was treated and named at Texas Children's Hospital before being released into foster care.

'She was very healthy… didn't have a fever,' Estella Olguin with the Child Protective Services told KHOU.

'Fortunately, she did not suffer from being exposed to the elements
that evening.'

Olguin said the parents do not have to claim the baby but that a discussion with them would be useful to identify Chloe's family's medical history.

'So the person who is adopting this baby can have some more genetic 
family medical background on the baby to be able to raise her with more 
knowledge or information about her,' Olguin said.

Tomorrow a hearing will be held to decide whether Chloe should continue in temporary care or the adoption process should begin.

Harris County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Christina Garza said 
once custody issues are resolved they had no doubt they could settle her into a new home.

'[Chloe] will be placed in a loving 
home,' she said. 'There is no shortage of people who want her'.

Officials with the Harris County 
Sheriff's Office Crimes Against Children Unit said they have few leads on the parents as there were no surveillance cameras in the area where she 
was abandoned.

'If it had not been for the 
resident that came out to walk her dogs, that child may have laid there 
all night, possibly would've died,' an officer said.

The case was particularly bizarre as Texas has a Safe Haven law which allows anyone to drop off a child with the authoritioes without facing any legal repercussions.
