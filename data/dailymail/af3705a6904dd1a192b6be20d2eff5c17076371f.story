North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's aunt was conspicuous by her absence in official photographs published by the regime today - days after her husband's execution.

Kim Kyong Hui, sister of the young despot's father, was not present at any of the state ceremonies marking the second anniversary of her brother's death.

It comes soon after Kim had her husband Jang Song Thaek, regarded as North Korea's second-most powerful man, summarily executed on charges of corruption, drug abuse and womanising.

This image, taken from a video, appears to show Kim Jong-Un with his wife, Ri Sol-Ju, who was feared missing

They appear to be seen at a memorial service for the second anniversary of Kim Jong-Un's father's death

Ri Sol-Ju and Kim's aunt, Kim Kyong Hui, are the two women to whom the unpredictable Kim turns for advice

Meanwhile Kim's wife cut a gaunt, unsettled figure as she appeared on state TV amid rumours she too had fallen out of favour.

There
 had been speculation that Ri Sol Ju was the latest member of the young 
despot's inner circle to fall victim to recent purges after she was not 
seen for a number of weeks.

But
 footage transmitted today by North Korean media appeared to show Kim 
and Ri side-by-side at a memorial service for his father.

Although
 it is not conclusive proof - because it is not certain the film was 
recorded today - the footage partially eases fears for Ri's safety.

Ri,
 along with Jang's widow, Kim Kyong Hui, are regarded by North Korean 
observers as the power behind the throne – two women to whom the 
unpredictable Kim turns for advice.

But
 their absence from official photographs has led to speculation she 
could have fallen out of favour with a husband and nephew who is swift 
to deliver punishment to anyone who shows the slightest sign of 
disloyalty.

Happy leader: Kim Jong Un was photographed laughing heartily with a handful of generals as he toured the warehouse - stage one of a series of 'field guidance' trips that also included a military design centre and a luxury ski resort

Happy leader: State-controlled news agency KCNA said he 'couldn't hold back joy or stop smiling' after being told fish production had grown dramatically this year

Tour: Kim's wave of public appearances around the country were intended to demonstrate his firm grip on power following the shock execution of his uncle, said analysts

The despot spent the anniversary of his father's death laughing heartily at a fishery today - just days after he executed his uncle.

Kim
 was photographed joking with a handful of generals as he toured the 
warehouse, in an undisclosed location in the hideaway state, where he 
praised the piles of fish as being like 'an ammunition depot full of 
artillery'.

The official 
visit formed stage one of a series of 'field guidance' trips that also 
included a military design centre and a luxury ski resort.

The
 cheerful visit was a marked contrast to a ceremony being held in his 
absence in Pyongyang that saw thousands of North Koreans pledge their 
loyalty to him and remember his father who died on December 17 2011.

The cheerful visit was a marked contrast to the ceremony being held in his absence in the square outside the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, home to the embalmed bodies of his father and grandfather.

'Our sole centre': The first to pay tribute were soldiers, wearing dark olive green uniforms and winter hats, who swore to safeguard Kim with their lives beneath a banner that read: 'Let's hold great comrade Kim Jong-un in high esteem as the sole center of unity and leadership'

'He couldn't hold back joy or stop smiling [after being told fish production had grown dramatically this year],' state-controlled news agency KCNA said.

'(Kim) smiled radiantly looking at the warehouse packed with stacks of fish, saying it looked like an ammunition depot full of artillery,' it added.

Pertinent: Citizens lay flowers at the site under the shadow of a nationalistic sculpture of workers cheering their leaders

Tribute: Chinese Ambassador to DPRK Liu Hongcai (Front) pays tribute to the bronze statues under the watchful eyes of North Korean military chiefs

He smiled and 'highly praised' the manager of a fisheries station controlled by a military unit as a 'hero' for catching big hauls of fish during his visit, the KCNA said.

Analysts claim Kim's whirlwind weekend tour around the country was intended to demonstrate his firm grip on power following the shock execution of his uncle.

Meanwhile in Pyongyang, thousands of soldiers, wearing dark olive green uniforms and winter hats, swore to safeguard Kim with their lives during a memorial service in a square outside the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, home to the embalmed bodies of his father and grandfather.

The synchronised troops carried huge banners that
 read: 'Let's hold great comrade Kim Jong-un in high esteem as the sole 
center of unity and leadership.'

Pictures released by the North's official news agency showed crowds kneeling silently in the shadows of two giant bronze statues of Kim Il-Sung, the country's founder, and his son Kim Jong-Il.

They were followed by citizens who laid wreaths at the sacred site in honour of the dead former leader.

Love reaffirmed: Soldiers assembled outside the Pyongyang landmark reaffirmed loyalty to the young leader, according to the caption of one picture

Under watch: Another photo showed a march by soldiers carrying red flags and flowers, watched by military leaders. It was not clear whether Jong-Un was among them

Stage-managed: Images of the memorial were beamed across the world - days after Kim Jong Un executed his uncle for treason

Sombre: It wasn't the joyous affair one might expect at a celebration of loyalty

Kim Jong-Un took power after his father's death, in the country's second dynastic succession.

Soldiers and citizens assembled outside the Pyongyang landmark reaffirmed loyalty to the young leader, according to the caption of one picture.

Wake: Yesterday Kim met with bereaved family members of Kim Kuk Thae, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, who died on Friday aged 81

Mighty fall: North Korea stunned the world last week by announcing the execution of Jang Song-Thaek (pictured being dragged into court to hear his death sentence), the uncle of the young Kim and the man once seen as his political regent

North Korea stunned the world last week by announcing the execution of Jang Song-Thaek, the uncle of the young Kim and the man once seen as his political regent.

His execution Thursday for corruption and plotting to overthrow the state - just days after he was ousted from all his party and military positions - marks the biggest political upheaval since Jong-Un inherited power.

The Kim dynasty has ruled the isolated country for more than six decades with an iron fist and a pervasive personally cult.
