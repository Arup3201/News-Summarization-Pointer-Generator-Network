A man is so addicted to eating plastic bags he even steals them from grocery stores to satisfy his cravings.

Robert, 23, from Oakland, Tennessee, has been eating plastic bags since he was seven years old.

Since his addiction began he has consumed a staggering 60,000 bags, which is enough to cover an entire US football field.

That's a LOT of bags: Since his addiction began he has consumed a staggering 60,000 bags, which is enough to cover an entire US football field

He starts off his day by eating a bag for breakfast - and he prefers the blue plastic bags that newspapers are delivered in. 

Sometimes he even drives around the neighbourhood looking for newspaper bags that have been left outside to satisfy his cravings.

And he even steals the see-through plastic bags on display for fruit and vegetables at the grocery store.

Robert believes that different coloured bags have different tastes but speaking on TLC's My Strange Addiction, he says the blue ones are 'just delicious.'

Sometimes he survived for a day and a half without proper food after gorging on plastic.

But fiancee Ashley is concerned over his addiction - and wants him to stop before their wedding in six months time.

Check-up: Even though eating plastic can cause liver damage and intestinal blockages, Robert's tests come back OK but he is going to try and cut down

The final straw for Ashley comes when the couple go to taste wedding cake - and Robert refuses to eat any because he's so full from eating plastic.

Later on he complains he has stomach ache - so he reluctantly agrees to see a doctor.

Even though eating plastic can cause liver damage and intestinal blockages, Robert's tests come back OK and he promises to Ashley he will try to cut back on eating plastic.

For love: Robert has promised his fiancee that he will try and curb his obsession in time for the couple's wedding
