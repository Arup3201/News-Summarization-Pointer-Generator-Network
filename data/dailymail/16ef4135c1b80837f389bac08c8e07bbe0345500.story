Gennaro Gattuso has been filmed working in McDonald's as part of the fast food outlet's new advertising campaign.

The former Italy and AC Milan midfielder, who has recently returned to coaching with Greek side OFI Crete, got stuck in behind the counter with fellow employees, although judging by the video clip he spent more time posing for pictures and signing autographs for fans.

Gattuso's remit in the Italian advert involved him acting as a McDonald's employee for two hours and he did not hesitate to help out serving customers.

As a midfielder Gattuso was known for his no-nonsense style of play which often involved hard tackling, and the Italian recently had some tough words for England coach Roy Hodgson ahead of England's World Cup opener against the Azzurri on June 14.

Hodgson included young, inexperienced players like Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling in his 23-man squad for Brazil, a tactic which Gattuso feels will hinder England's chances of success.

He said: 'I don’t really agree with Hodgson’s youth policy. Experience – it’s not something you buy at Tesco.

'It’s something you earn, bit by bit, and it matters because I am dead sure that, when youngsters are there listening to the national anthem, their legs will be shaking.

'And, in those cases, you need expert players. Without experience, it can really be tough.'

High hopes: Gattuso reckons Wayne Rooney will star for England at the World Cup in Brazil

Gattuso also revealed that he expects Wayne Rooney to star in Brazil, despite struggling to find his best form in the run-up to the World Cup and having never scored in his previous two appearances at the tournament.

He said: 'Personally, I expect a big World Cup from Wayne Rooney because this season he has been ­experiencing ups and downs and this World Cup can be the ­occasion to cement his place in history.'

'Generally speaking, I think that every player like Gerrard or Lampard, who are 35-36 years old, when facing that humidity, must really be careful.

'They’re not 25 anymore and that can be a real variable. England will need their experience both on and off the field. They just need the right mix.'

Short stay: Gattuso won't be working full-time at McDonald's after recently taking over Greek side OFI Crete
