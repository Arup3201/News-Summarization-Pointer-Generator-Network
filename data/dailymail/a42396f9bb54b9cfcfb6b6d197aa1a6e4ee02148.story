The NHS could collapse within five years if the Government does not increase health spending, senior MPs have warned.

Former Conservative Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell called on David Cameron to boost the NHS budget as the economy recovered to avoid a crisis. 

He was joined by the new chair of the Health Select Committee, Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who warned that it was 'hard to see how we could maintain current levels of service'  if spending was not increased.

Paul Burstow, a Lib Dem former health minister, meanwhile said that the NHS needed an extra £15 billion  over the next five years 'if you don't want the system to collapse during the course of the next parliament'.

Conservative former Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell and the new Health Select Committee chair Sarah Wollaston have called for an increase in spending on the NHS

The warnings come amid growing concern in the Government over the pressure on A&E departments.

The NHS says 299,031 patients arrived at A&E departments last week – the highest number on record.

Emergency waiting time targets were missed for the 49th consecutive week and a record number of beds were filled last month by patients who could not be released from hospital, often because community or social care services were not in place.

The NHS must receive a real terms increase in spending over the next five years if it is to function properly, the three senior MPs claimed.

For the past four years, the government has ringfenced the health service budget from cuts and raised its funding only in line with inflation.

Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said David Cameron's decision to introduce far-reaching reforms of the NHS had been his 'biggest mistake by far'

But amid growing demand for treatment and a growing elderly population, the health service has been forced to find £30 billion in 'efficiency savings'.

Mr Dorrell, who claimed that the challenge to make £30 billion worth of efficiency savings had failed, said he would be ashamed if the NHS budget did not receive a boost in income at a time when the economy was growing.

He said: 'I am in favour of the government not denying what 5,000 years of history tells us is true, which is that every time a society gets richer it spends a rising share of its income on looking after the sick and the vulnerable.

Mrs Wollaston, a GP for 20 years before becoming an MP in 2010, said: 'If there is not an increase, it is hard to see how we could maintain current levels of service given the rising demand.

'The NHS budget has been protected in line with background inflation but that does not keep pace with inflation in health costs from rising demand and demographic changes.

'I don't want to see any reduction in services; I would like to see further improvements and that will require an increase in funding.'

Chris Ham, chief executive of the health thinktank, the King's Fund, and a former Downing Street adviser, warned of another NHS disaster on the scale of the Mid Staffordshire scandal if more money is not found.

He said: 'The well-publicised failures of care at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation were caused by precisely this kind of cost cutting, with tragic consequences for the families concerned."

The NHS is looking likely to be a key battleground at the general election. This week a private member's bill will be introduced to repeal the Coalition's controversial health and social care act, which ushered in greater private sector involvement in the NHS.

The bill, which will be put forward by Clive Efford MP and debated in November, would scrap the rules which force companies to compete to provide health services.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham claimed the vote on the bill would 'without doubt be the defining moment of what remains of this parliament'.

He added: 'Cameron's biggest mistake by far is his decision to break the coalition agreement promise of "no top-down reorganisation of the NHS".'
