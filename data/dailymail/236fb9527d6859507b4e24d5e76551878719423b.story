Falkirk starlet Conor McGrandles has clinched a dream move to Norwich City in a record £1million deal for the Bairns.

Although they refused to disclose the precise fee, it is understood they are set to rake in a seven-figure sum with add-ons. 

Falkirk hailed it as the highest ever received by the club and ‘a remarkable achievement’ for their famed youth academy.

Big move: Conor McGrandles has left Falkirk to join Norwich in a £1million deal

It certainly marks an incredible rise for the athletic 18-year-old midfielder who made his first-team debut nearly two years ago, just five days after his 17th birthday, and has gone to make 72 appearances.

Aston Villa also showed interest but McGrandles joined the Championship side on the recommendation of former Falkirk boss Gary Holt, who returned to the Canaries in the summer as assistant to Neil Adams.

McGrandles will be the third talented youngster to leave the Bairns in the space of just seven months, with midfielder Jay Fulton and defender Stephen Kingsley having departed for Swansea City in January and June respectively.

Manager Peter Houston said he was ‘gutted’ to see McGrandles leave but thrilled the teenager has earned a shot at the big time.

‘Conor was always a player who was going to move on and play at a higher level,’ he said. ‘This was a fantastic opportunity for him and we wish him well at Norwich. It is also fantastic for our club – an endorsement of our commitment to our Academy and to bringing young players into the first team at a very early stage.

‘We said we will only sell another player this window if the offer was absolutely exceptional. This was – and it allows us to strengthen the team and have the funds to look at other developments at the club.’

Meanwhile, a Falkirk statement read: ‘The precise fee is undisclosed but is the highest ever received by the club. This is remarkable achievement for the club and its youth policy. Even before taking add-ons into consideration, the fee exceeds previous high fees from the sales of John Hughes, Scott Arfield, Murray Wallace and Stephen Kingsley.

‘The income from the transfer gives the club more financial security than ever before. The funds will not simply be used to fund operating losses. More budget has been given to Peter Houston to strengthen the first team squad and he will be working to see what new faces he can bring in.

‘It is also an exceptional achievement for Conor McGrandles. He has proved himself at our level and fully deserves his opportunity to play and earn at a much higher level. Conor has demonstrated what can be achieved through the Academy and at the club.

‘The club will never hold a young ambitious player back and fully accept this is a natural progression for such a talented player.’
