Vacant: A city has spent a month without a police department after the last two cops quit

The city which has a population of 1,500 lost their Chief of Police when he resigned back in December to take a job with the Crosby County Sheriff's Department.

Then in January another officer resigned on January 11th to move to Garza County, reported KCBD.

Lorenzo City Manager Rusty Forbes was quick to reassure residents that they were not completely alone saying nearby Ralls, which is eight miles away, has two police officers who have 
been helping respond to calls.

Issue: Lorenzo City Manager Rusty Forbes says the main problem is the town's dwindling population and the struggle to keep police officers wanting to stay in small towns where their salaries are much lower

Crosby
County Sheriff Deputies have also been patrolling and are on standby to help out.

He says the main problem is the 
town's dwindling population - in small towns the salary for police officers is much lower.

'Small towns kind of seem to be the
stepping stone,' Mr Forbes said.

'Right now our council is looking at 
whether we're going to hire another Chief of Police or contract out with
the county.'

Mr Forbes says this option is economical because it would 
actually save the city money, and still provide just as much protection 
for the citizens.
