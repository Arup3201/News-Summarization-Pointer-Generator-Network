A cautious boost was given to the housing market today as it emerged prices were rising –with London seeing a 5.4 per cent increase pushing the cost of an average home just shy of £300,000.

And it was good news for most homeowners across the UK as lenders Nationwide reported a ‘surprisingly resilient’ increase of 1.1 per cent across the board pushing the average house price up to £163,822 despite a 0.2 per cent month-on-month fall in December.

But just as prices in London rocketed, despite the deepening recession, it was a year of contrasting fortunes with Northern Ireland seeing a staggering drop of 8.9 per cent.

And the good news comes with a bitter aftertaste as Nationwide warned demand and supply remain weak, with mortgage approvals standing at around half their long-term levels.

Its report said Northern Ireland and London stood out over the past 12 months, with the sharp drop in house prices felt by Northern Ireland being a marked contrast to the relative stability seen overall.

Averaging £113,614, house prices in Northern Ireland have been slashed to half their 2007 peak levels and it was named as the worst-performing area for the fourth year in a row.

Homes in Northern Ireland have become more affordable than anywhere else in the UK however, with an average house price to earnings ratio of 4.1, down from 9.2 in 2007.

Belfast was the worst-performing city over the year, with prices nose-diving by 19 per cent to average £161,326.

At the other end of the spectrum, prices in London, which is popular with overseas buyers, are just shy of £300,000 and are 1.6 per cent below their all-time highs, compared with prices across the UK which are 10 per cent below their peak levels.

Prices in the London areas of Camden, Greenwich, Hackney and Westminster have doubled over the last decade.

But London is also the least affordable region, with a house price to earnings ratio of 7.4.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said: 'The 1 per cent rise in house prices recorded over the past 12 months can hardly be described as a strong performance, but against a backdrop of anaemic economic growth and a deteriorating labour market, UK house prices are surprisingly resilient in 2011.'

He continued: 'Although high rates of unemployment, falling real wages and the uncertain economic outlook kept many potential homebuyers on the sidelines, the supply side of the market was similarly squeezed.

'Thanks to continued low interest rates, the number of forced sales remained low. Together with a dearth in building activity in recent years, this prevented a glut of unsold homes from accumulating on the market.

'This meant that although demand and supply were both weak, they remained relatively well-matched.'

Scotland saw an annual house price fall for the second year in a row, but remains one of the more affordable areas of the UK, with a house price to earnings ratio of 4.5.

Prices in Wales saw an increase slightly above the UK average, although North Wales and Mid and West Wales were the weakest-performing areas of the country and saw prices fall by 1 per cent.

Despite the London price hikes, the Yorkshire city of Bradford was named as the best-performing city over the year, with prices rising by 10 per cent to average £158,401.

Mr Gardner said labour market conditions are likely to remain 'challenging' in 2012, putting off potential buyers, which could tip the market in buyers’ favour.

He said: 'The housing market in 2012 looks likely to be characterised by low levels of activity once again, with prices moving sideways or modestly lower over the course of the year.'
