Scarlett Johansson has resigned as an ambassador for humanitarian group Oxfam in a row over her support for an Israeli company.

The 29-year-old actress is promoting Soda Stream and is set to appear in an advert for the company during the Super Bowl.

But left-leaning critics and Oxfam oppose the company because it has a large factory in an Israeli settlement 
in the West Bank - a territory captured by Israel in 1967 and claimed by 
the Palestinians.

Oxfam opposes all trade from Israeli settlements because 
they say it is illegal and denies Palestinian rights.

In response to criticism, Johansson yesterday severed ties with Oxfam after eight years saying she supports trade and 'social interaction between a democratic Israel and Palestine'.  The charity had earlier said her Soda Stream deal was 'incompatible' with her role as an ambassador.

The controversy has come at a delicate time for U.S.-backed peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli officials fear that if the talks fail, a nascent call for an economic boycott of Israel and its settlements might grow.

A statement released by Johansson's 
spokesman yesterday said the 29-year-old actress has 'a fundamental 
difference of opinion' with Oxfam.

'Scarlett Johansson has respectfully decided to end her ambassador role with Oxfam after eight years,' the statement said.

'She and Oxfam have a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. She is very proud of her accomplishments and fundraising efforts during her tenure with Oxfam.'

The political divisions fueling the controversy over Scarlett Johansson's Soda Stream deal date back decades to the creation of Israel in 1947 and its decades of conflict with neigbouring Arab countries.

Critics say Soda Stream should not operate a plant in an Israeli settlement on the West Bank - which was occupied by Israeli forces in the aftermath of the Six Day War in 1967.

Before that, the area was part of Palestine. Palestinians say the land is rightfully theirs and international law has declared Israeli occupation of area technically illegal for decades.

In 1967, Israel launched an attack on Egypt and then also went to war with Jordan and Syria believing its very survival was at stake.

The attack had followed months of military build up and rhetoric from Jordan, Syria, and Egypt and generals in Tel Aviv believed striking first was essential to their country's survival. 

After a surprise air attack on Egypt that wiped out that country's air force, The Israeli Defence Force routed the combined forces of Jordan, Egypt and Syria. In the aftermath,Israeli took control of the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan heights.

Tens of thousands of Palestinians fled and Israel established de-facto control over all of the area that was originally Palestine. Israeli leaders insist that they had to have control over the area to ensure the survival of the their state.

In the decades since, Israel has since built scores of settlements on the occupied territories which have been condemned by the international community including the United States and Britain.

Israel has since withdrawn from most of the West Bank under a series of peace deals, but many settlements including Maale Adumin, where the Soda Stream plant is, remain.

The plant employs both Israelis and Palestinians. But activists including Oxfam say that trade with Israeli companies which operates in settlements legitamize the technically illegal towns and contribute to the continued poverty and denial of rights to Palestinians.

However, the Soda Stream plant employs both Palestinians and Israelis and the company says it is a model of peaceful cooperation.

Both settlers and Palestinians receive equal wages and at the plant, which makes the Palestinians who work there far higher paid than average. In return, activists say Palestinians have few other employment options and are being taken advantage of.

Unequal rights? Critics including Oxfam say that companies should not trade with companies that operate in Israeli settlements because it deprives Palestinian of their rights

Representatives of SodaStream, which is listed on Nasdaq in New York, say the Israeli and Palestinian workers at the plant Maale Adumim in receive equal wages and benefits that far exceed those offered in Palestinian-run areas.

However campaigners say they have testimony from Palestinian workers who say they are treated like 'slaves' and are fired if they become ill.

Earlier this month, Johansson signed on as the first global brand ambassador of SodaStream International Ltd., and she's set to appear in an ad for the at-home soda maker during the Super Bowl on Sunday.

In response to the criticism, 
Johansson said last week she was a 'supporter of economic cooperation 
and social interaction between a democratic Israel and Palestine.'

Oxfam
 took issue with Johansson, noting it was 'considering the implications 
of her new statement and what it means for Ms. Johansson's role as an 
Oxfam global ambassador.'

Support 
 for complete boycotts of Israel goods is composed mostly of 
pro-Palestinian intellectuals and bloggers, advocates for a blanket 
boycott of all Israeli goods and questions the state's legitimacy.

But there is a different consensus among international rights groups like Oxfam, however, which discourages trade only with Israeli firms located on land in the occupied West Bank.

'The very existence of (Israeli settlements) amounts to a serious violation of international law," the New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Wednesday.

'It is impossible to ignore the Israeli system of unlawful discrimination, land confiscation, natural resource theft, and forced displacement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, where SodaStream is located,' the rights group added.

There are increasing fears in Israel that such calls for a boycott of its goods are growing. Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid warned this week that his country risks the 'reality of a European boycott, even a very partial one,[and] Israel's economy will retreat backward and every Israeli citizen will feel it straight in the pocket.'

Super commercial: Scarlett will be featured in a SodaStream commercial airing during the Super Bowl game on Sunday

Johansson had served as a global ambassador for Oxfam since 2007, raising funds and promoting awareness about global poverty.

In her role as an Oxfam ambassador, she traveled to India, Sri Lanka and Kenya to highlight the impact of traumatic disasters and chronic poverty.

A spokesman for Oxfam said: 'Oxfam has accepted Scarlett Johansson’s decision to step down after eight years as a Global Ambassador and we are grateful for her many contributions.

'While Oxfam respects the independence of our ambassadors, Ms Johansson’s role promoting the company SodaStream is incompatible with her role as an Oxfam Global Ambassador.

'Oxfam believes that businesses, such as SodaStream, that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support. Oxfam is opposed to all trade from Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.

'Ms Johansson has worked with Oxfam since 2005 and in 2007 became a Global Ambassador, helping to highlight the impact of natural disasters and raise funds to save lives and fight poverty.' 

SodaStream had to make revisions to its Super Bowl ad after it was initially banned for making references to Coke and Pepsi, which are sponsors of the American football championship game.

But in an In an interview on Wednesday, SodaStream's chief executive, Dan Birnbaum, shrugged off the boycott campaign.

'To the best of my knowledge, we have not lost a single customer," he said. "If anything, it advances our awareness around the world, because people are talking about SodaStream.'
