Superbrain: The Victorian naturalist Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection revolutionised understanding of life

It was an era of glorious scientific discovery.

And the reason for the Victorians unprecedented success is simple – they were ‘substantially cleverer’ than us.

Researchers compared reaction times - a reliable indicator of general intelligence – since the late 1800s to the present day and found our fleetness of mind is diminishing.

They claim our slowing reflexes 
suggest we are less smart than our ancestors, with a loss of 1.23 IQ points
 per decade or 14 IQ points since Victorian times.

While
 an average man in 1889 had a reaction time of 183 milliseconds, this 
has slowed to 253ms in 2004.

They found the same case with women, whose 
speed deteriorated from 188 to 261ms in the same period.

The
 research team from Umea University, Sweden, the University of Amsterdam
 and University College Cork said IQ scores are excellent predictors of 
job performance and those with higher intelligence are both more 
productive and creative.

But
 the scientists were unable to directly compare IQ from different eras 
as earlier generations had limited access to education, improved 
nutrition and hygiene, which would have boosted modern results.

Instead,
 they compared reaction times, which they claim ‘can be used to 
meaningfully compare historical and contemporary populations in terms of
 levels of general intelligence’.

The
 figures indicate a decline in brainpower since the Victorian era, which
 contradicts the so-called Flynn effect, which has found a worldwide 
increase in measured IQ scores of three points a decade since the Second World War.

Researcher Dr Michael Woodley said: ‘They actually indicate a pronounced decline in IQ since the Victorian era, three times bigger than previous theoretical estimates would have us believe.’

The report in the journal Intelligence found: ‘The Victorian era was characterized by great accomplishments. As great accomplishment is generally a product of high intelligence, we tested the hypothesis that the Victorians were actually cleverer than modern populations.

‘We used a robust elementary cognitive indicator of general intelligence, namely measures of simple reaction times.’

And with the research looking at historical reaction time data, the scientists claim the drop in modern IQ could be even more dramatic than predicted.

‘It should also be emphasized that whilst our value of a −14.1 IQ point decline is an estimate based on the best meta-analytical data available, a simple inspection of our figure shows there is a non-negligible amount of scatter around the regression line.

‘The real magnitude of the effect might therefore be several IQ points lower or even higher,’ they wrote.

‘In conclusion however these findings do indicate that with respect to "genetic g" [general intelligence] the Victorians were indeed substantially cleverer than modern populations.’

Commenting on the study, Dr James Thompson, honorary senior psychology lecturer at UCL and member of the British Psychological Society, said: ‘This is a very intriguing paper, which seems to give the lie to the comforting notion that we have all been getting brighter for the last three or four generations.

‘Reaction times are a real measure, with a reasonably large correlation with IQ, so this is an alarming finding and needs further investigation.’
