With his  hipster beard, his trendy bow tie and numerous tattoos sprawled all over his body, Rob Popejoy is clearly no ordinary man of the cloth.

Instead, this 30-year-old college chaplain travels on his skateboard, sings along to hip-hop - and even bares his tattoo-laden chest for part-time modelling.

Not only does Mr Popejoy use a motorbike to get to work, he is also covered in body art, including a huge tattoo of Jesus, which stretches across his chest.

College chaplain Rob Popejoy has a bushy beard, listens to hip-hop and has a huge tattoo of Jesus on his chest - all of which he says helps him connect with parishioners

Mr Popejoy admits he is not particularly orthodox and rides into work on either his motorbike or his skateboard

And although he's not exactly orthodox by Christian standards, the 30-year-old is proud of his ‘less than conventional’ style, saying it helps him relate to his parishioners on a one-to-one level.

He said: 'I try to do things differently. As I am representing religion and faith, I think we need to challenge the old traditional ways to keep religion fresh and approachable to all.  

'You can still be religious, be who you want to be, and be up for a good laugh.

'There is a common misconception that church leaders tend to have a certain holier than thou look to them, but I am just me.'  

His body art includes 'A New Hope' written across his knuckles. He also proudly sports the Star Wars rebellion logo and has his baptism date on his arm. 

He added that students can relate to him because he is more like them. His hobbies include snowboarding, football and hip-hop music.

The vicar, chaplain at City of Bath College, added that students can relate to him because he is more like them

Bucking the trend even more, his usual modes of transport are motorbike or skateboard.  

Mr Popejoy even agreed to do part-time modelling for photography and art pupils at the City of Bath College, where he works. 

The vicar agreed to be photographed bare-chested wearing a bow tie, while covered in paint, for a project by student Harriet Evans. 

His artwork includes 'A New Hope' written across his knuckles (left) and the Star Wars rebellion logo, as well as his baptism date on his arm (right)

Photographs of the multi-faith chaplain's heavily tattooed hands are on display in the corridor of the art and design department at the college.

Student Fen Marren also took photographs for her end of year project.

He said: 'It's great that people recognise I look different and think I look good in photographs, but I am not about to give up my day job and launch a modelling career.'

He started at the college in February last year having previously worked as a teaching assistant, a youth worker and a basketball coach.
