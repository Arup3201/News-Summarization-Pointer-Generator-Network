Celebration: Brash and friend at the Greenwich party on Monday

He said he hoped winning a gold medal would improve his chances with the ladies.

But show-jumper Scott Brash yesterday admitted it hadn’t quite worked out.

The single 26-year-old – who won a team gold in the show-jumping on Monday – was seen out celebrating that night in Greenwich.

But yesterday, the day he competed in the individual event, he revealed he ended that evening without a lady in tow.

He had earlier told BBC presenter Claire Balding, who asked him how the win would change his life: ‘I really hope this win improves my pulling power with women, if I’m honest! That’s about it.’

But yesterday the rider from Peebles said things hadn’t gone to plan.

‘The medal hasn’t had the good effect I hoped for,’ he admitted – adding: ‘I had too good a celebration and a sore head the next day.’

Brash, 26, was one of the British riders who won gold in the team show-jumping on Monday.

Both he and veteran Nick Skelton competed again yesterday for individual medals – but both narrowly missed out after incurring faults on the final round.

Skelton’s hopes were dashed in Greenwich Park when he hit a fence called Cutty Sark. It was his first error over six rounds of team and individual jumping but it meant he slipped from a potential gold medal jump-off to finish equal fifth with Brash.

Despite his disappointment, popular Skelton, who became Britain’s oldest medallist on Monday, received a standing ovation after his performance.

Although he had a hip replacement last year, a shoulder operation the year before that, and has ‘problems walking about’, Skelton was instrumental in Team GB’s victory in team show-jumping on Monday.

It was an amazing comeback for the colourful rider, who feared he would never ride again after he was thrown from his horse 11 years ago, broke his back and almost died.

When asked about his injuries, Skelton joked: ‘I’ve had two cartilage operations, a shoulder replacement, a hip replacement, a broken neck and I’ve got to get a back replacement – but apart from that I’m fine.’ 

After finishing his round, the rider shrugged and smiled before taking his hat off for the crowd and clapping the spectators.

He was rewarded with an enthusiastic send off, with 23,000 spectators cheering and stamping for the popular rider.

Afterwards, the 54-year-old - who is on his sixth Olympics - said he was ‘disappointed’ not to get another medal.

Skelton added: ‘That is our game, you know. You touch one pole, and you can’t get it back. At least we’ve come away with a gold medal, which is brilliant. It is great for the sport, great for me.’

Steve Guerdat, 30, ended an 88-year wait for a Swiss gold medallist in individual show-jumping.

Ireland’s Cian O’Connor won the bronze, the nation’s first medal of the games.
