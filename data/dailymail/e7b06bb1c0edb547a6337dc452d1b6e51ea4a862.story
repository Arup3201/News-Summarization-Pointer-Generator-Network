Congressman Michael Grimm's ties to his former colleagues in the FBI were not as pleasant as he portrayed as a new report reveals that he was banned from the agency's offices since he left in 2006.

The Republican, who was indicted two weeks ago on 20 counts including tax evasion and fraud, worked as an undercover FBI agent for years before running for office but the extent of the scorched earth he left behind was not evident until today.

DNAinfo reports that security guards were given explicit orders to keep Grimm from entering either of the two New York City FBI offices after he resigned.

They even posted his photo in the security stations to make sure that the guards would not allow him in the buildings along with about two dozen other disgruntled former agents and employees.

'He is not welcome,' a former FBI official said, according to DNAinfo.

The unidentified former official said that the people- like Grimm- who were banned from entering the FBI buildings 'are all employees who were fired, or they were under circumstances where they were forced out or felt they should leave, and all are no longer welcome back.'

Grimm left the agency in 2006 when he was reportedly the subject of an internal review in light of two troubling concerns.

There were allegations that he told a female source that he was working undercover while still working on a case, and there were also questions raised about expenses he had filed.

After leaving the agency, he went on to work in private businesses and got involved in a health food restaurant called Healthalicious, which has come back into the fold since the charges against him stem from allegedly illegal payment practices at the Upper East Side restaurant.

In 2010, he was elected to Congress amid a wave of Tea Party support, but that didn't mean that all was forgiven over at the FBI.

'Some of us thought it was kind of a joke after he was elected to Congress that his picture stayed up,' the unidentified former FBI official said.

Grimm, who was caught on camera threatening to throw a reporter off the balcony of the Capitol building earlier this year, has maintained his innocence in the tax evasion and fraud case and a spokesman denied any knowledge that he had left the FBI on bad terms. 

'False rumors and malicious lies relating to the congressman’s tenure in the FBI have been reported on since 2010 and have been repeatedly refuted,' the spokesman told DNAinfo.

Earlier this week, Grimm's ex-girlfriend Diana Durand entered a not guilty plea on the charges she faced for allegedly arranging accounts for fake donors to contribute to his 2010 congressional campaign.

Both she and Grimm are free on bail as he awaits further hearings in his case.

He has maintained his innocence throughout the process and has not announced any plans to resign from his position, but he did step down from his role on the House Financial Services Committee.

Grimm sent House Speaker and Majority Leader John Boehner a letter removing himself from the committee due to the arrest, but said that he hopes to be reinstated when he is cleared of all charges.

He is charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and tax fraud, all of which are connected to his involvement with Healthalicious when he was an investor before launching into his political career in 2010.

The lengthy indictment charges Grimm with two different types of fraud- mail and wire- as well as obstruction of justice, perjury, employing illegal immigrants, and conspiracy to defraud the United States.

He is accused of concealing more than $1million in receipts, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars that were kept away from employees.

While helping run the Manhattan restaurant, Healthalicious, Grimm is accused of keeping two sets of payroll records.

The one he turned over to the restaurant's accountants, who used them as the basis for their tax returns, showed lower payouts to employees than he was actually paying them- as he opted for cash payouts of either half or all of their earnings so that there was no trail.

The perjury charge, however, comes from a deposition in January 2013 where he allegedly lied under oath. 

The deposition came when former employees accused Grimm of paying them less than minimum wage.
