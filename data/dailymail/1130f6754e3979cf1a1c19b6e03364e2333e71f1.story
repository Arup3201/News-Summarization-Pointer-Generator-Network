It has been a long four years for Jenn Suhr, whose dramatic journey had her fighting back from a debilitating illness and other injuries to defeat the Russian favourite and come out on top with Olympic gold in the pole vault.

Suhr, 30, had a tough foe in Yelena Isinbayeva, of Russia, who was aiming to be the first woman in track and field history to win the same individual event in three straight Olympics.

She was Jenn Stuczynski back in 2008 when she competed against Isbinbayeva in the pole vault at the Beijing games.

But it was her Russian rival who triumphed, breaking her own world record and clearing a height of 16 feet and seven inches.

The world was watching when, after coming up short against Isinbayeva and picking up the silver medal, her coach, Rich Suhr, could be seen berating her.

What the world didn’t know was that the athlete and her coach were dating, and in 2010, they were married.

With Beijing in her rear-view mirror, Mrs Suhr began to focus on the London games, but it didn’t come easy.

While training last year, she was having difficulty bouncing back from workouts and was constantly feeling weak and suffering abdominal pain.

She later found that she had Celiac disease, a digestive illness caused by the protein gluten.

There is no cure for the disease, but its symptoms can be avoided by switching to a gluten-free diet, which she did in order to continue her training.

The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported that her Olympic journey hit another snag in May, when she tore her right quadriceps muscle.

Throw in an Achilles injury, and the odds were dramatically against her.

Suhr's husband could not help but recall another underdog story, the 1980 U.S. hockey team, who beat the odds and beat their Russian rivals in the Lake Placid.

Celiac disease is a digestive illness that is caused by a reaction to the protein gluten.

The condition can cause damage to the walls of the small intestine making it difficult to absorb certain nutrients, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Gluten is primarily found in foods like pasta, bread and pizza crust.

There is no known cure for the disease, and patients are advised to switch to a gluten-free diet to avoid symptoms, which include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and fatigue.

Like the Americans on the ice, Suhr came back stronger than ever, and blew away the competition - including Isbinbayeva, who wound up with the bronze.

It was a shining moment for the 30-year-old as she embraced her husband, who wrapped an American flag around her as she sobbed.

Following her success, Suhr wrote on Facebook: 'It’s very emotional. It’s something that you work so hard for, for four years, and heartbreak and joy, and then some more heartbreak.

'To overcome it and come out on top is something that whenever I thought of I started crying, so I knew it was just going to be emotional, whenever I thought about how it would feel to win gold.

'Then I would think of how it would feel to be fourth, and I'd cry over that too. It was definitely something that I’ve wanted, I don’t think I've ever wanted anything so bad.'
