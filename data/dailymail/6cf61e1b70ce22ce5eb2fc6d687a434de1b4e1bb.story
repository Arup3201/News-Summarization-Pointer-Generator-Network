Hans Riegel, the boss of German gummy bear maker Haribo, has died at the age of 90

The gummi bear baron who built the Haribo sweet empire has died at the age of 90.

Hans Riegel, the driving force behind Germany's Haribo confectionary and much-loved gummi bears, died of heart failure today in Bonn, according to his office.

Mr Riegel, who spent almost seven decades at the helm of the company, invented its world-famous 'kids and grown-ups love it so' slogan.

He also made Haribo's gummi bears - beloved for their bright colours and teddy-bear shape - a sugary staple across the globe.

Mr Riegel, who inherited the company from his candymaker father in 1946, built it up into a candy giant that now employs more than 6,000 people.

It has an annual turnover of about $2.5billion (£1.6billion) and claims to churn out 100 million gummi bears every day.

It also makes a range of jellied sweets, including cola bottles, hearts, milk bottles, liquorice and dummies.

The brand, which has become a global household name, has 15 factories across Europe and exports to 100 countries.

In a tribute to Mr Reigel's success in making Haribo a 'global brand', German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said: 'Wherever I travelled in the last few years, the gold bears had already long been there.'

Mr Riegel's father, also named Hans, founded Haribo - an acronym for 'Hans Riegel Bonn' - in 1920.

In 1922, the candymaker invented the 'dancing bear' - a small bear made out of fruit gum that laid the 
foundations for Haribo's later success. He died in 1945.

After their release as allied prisoners in the Second World War, Mr Riegel and his younger brother Paul set about rebuilding the family firm.

At the time, the company had only about 30 employees - however, five years later, the Riegel brothers were in charge of at least 1,000 members of staff.

Paul Riegel, who died in 2009, focused on
production, while Hans Riegel took charge of marketing and sales - coining the much-quoted jingle 'kids and 
grown-ups love it so, the happy world of Haribo'.

According to Haribo, Mr Riegel was inspired by children's magazines and comics.

'I love children. They are my customers. I have to be informed 
about what they want to nibble, what they think, what language they 
speak,' he once said. 

In the 1960s and 1970s, the company acquired businesses in the Netherlands, France and Britain, before setting up a sales office in Baltimore, America, in 1982.

Its worldwide success may have been encouraged by the fact that, in 1985, Disney launched an animated television series called 'Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears'.

Despite no direct link to the sweets being made, the cartoons were shown around the globe.

In 2000, Haribio was criticised for refusing to contribute to a fund set up by German businesses and the government to compensate forced labourers during the Nazi period.

The company insisted there was no evidence it had ever benefited from forced labour.

Mr Riegel was awarded Germany's highest honor, the Federal Cross of Merit, in 1994.

The award recognised not only his successful business career, but his commitment to social issues, such as his encouragement of the training of talented young people and sports.

At the time of his death, Mr Riegel had been recovering from an operation to remove a benign brain tumour.

He remained a co-owner and active participator in Haribo until the end.
