Darren Fletcher says the rivalry between Manchester United and Liverpool will be as intense as ever when they meet in the final of the International Champions Cup on Monday - even if it is still pre-season.

The Scot has played more minutes on United's tour of the United States than any of his team-mates and is likely to feature again when the old foes meet in Miami.

After three years of pain and frustration as he battled ulcerative colitis, the 270 minutes Fletcher has played on the tour finally proves he is on the road to recovery.

Pumped up: Darren Fletcher is desperate to land the first blow of the season as Manchester United prepare to take on old rivals Liverpool in the Miami final of the International Champions Cup on Monday

Back in action: After three years of setbacks as he struggled with ulcerative colitis, Fletcher has played more minutes on United's pre-season tour of America than any other player

Good start: United have won the first four matches of the Louis van Gaal era, beating LA Galaxy, Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid on their Stateside tour

He is confident of overcoming a calf injury to play in the final and stoked the rivalry ahead of the coming Barclays Premier League season.

'It’s Man Utd vs Liverpool. It doesn't matter if it’s pre-season. We want to win,' he said.

Fletcher captained Manchester United to their fourth and most impressive pre-season win on Saturday when they defeated Real Madrid 3-1 at Michigan Stadium in front of 109,318 spectators.

With all the focus being on Louis van Gaal, the story of Fletcher’s return to the first-team has flown under the radar over the last fortnight.

In 2011 Fletcher was diagnosed with the chronic bowel disease.

The debilitating illness left Fletcher 'running to the toilet 10, 20, 30 times a day,' he explained recently.

As a result, Fletcher has spent nearly two of the last three years on the sidelines.

It is no surprise, therefore, that he is happy to be back to full fitness.

'I don’t want to look back, but everyone knows I've been through a lot,' Fletcher said.

'I have not had a pre-season for three years.

'But now I am back in the gym and I am feeling the benefits from that.

'I am getting stronger and hopefully I can get as fit as possible.

'I am looking forward to the new season.'

For a man who has dedicated the last 19 years of his life to Manchester United, last season’s seventh-place under David Moyes was hard to take.

The midfielder and his team-mates want to prove that was nothing but a blip.

'Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea all finished above us last year so it was disappointing for us,' he said.

'Next season we all want to show what we are capable of.

'We have got a fantastic team spirit. We were talking about it the other night among ourselves.

'We are all pulling in the right direction and we all want the best for Manchester United.

'We realise some experienced players have gone and it’s up to us to come together and get us back up there.'

It may just be pre-season, but the fact that three of United’s four wins on tour have come against some of Europe’s top clubs has given the squad optimism about the season ahead.

Van Gaal must take credit for installing that confidence among the playing staff.

The contrast between the atmosphere in the camp and the final weeks of Moyes’ reign could not be greater.

The players are happy to undertake double training sessions under their new manager and they have adapted well to Van Gaal’s 3-4-1-2 formation.

The players are smiling again. And so is the manager, who was happy to chat and pose for photographs with fans after the match in Ann Arbor on Saturday.

'We are just enjoying it,' Fletcher said when asked about the difference between this season and the last.

'The manager expects a lot from us and he thinks we have got the ability to do it.

'He demands a lot, but the players have responded.

'We are enjoying playing in a new system and under him.'

Just like United, Liverpool have experienced a summer of upheaval, with star striker Luis Suarez departing for Barcelona.

The Reds have registered wins over Manchester City, AC Milan and Olympiacos while in the US though so they will be confident of taking home the one million US dollar prize (£600,000) too.

Liverpool will be without Daniel Sturridge as he has been sent home for treatment on a hamstring injury which kept him out of Saturday’s 2-0 win over AC Milan.

'Dan has flown back to the UK,' Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said.

'He had a really, really slight feeling in his hamstring. It’s nothing major.'
