The song is straightforward and carries the usual expletive, for semi-rhyme as well as effect. Gabby Agbonlahor, cry Aston Villa fans to the tune of Karma Chameleon, is rather fast. That’s the clean version.

The frequency with which the words are heard from now until the end of the season will prove largely correlative to Villa’s chances of remaining a Premier League team.

They have not been sounded all too often this campaign. But at Villa Park on Tuesday night, especially during the first half, Agbonlahor produced a performance to warrant adulation.

It was arguably his best display in years, a return to those days when his speed and strength shot him into the England set-up.

Agbonlahor consistently harried Gareth McAuley and Joleon Lescott, chasing down balls he had no obligation to reach, using his stocky physique to keep hold of possession when under threat.

Christian Benteke got the headlines for his late winning goal, but it was Agbonlahor who set the tone. His goal was a classic case of pace proving the difference. He latched onto Benteke’s nodded flick and finished while making statues of the West Bromwich Albion central defenders.

He did similar when creating a pass out Ashley Westwood’s hopeful ball, sprinting to startle the opposition backline and only being denied a second by Lescott’s goalline clearance. Boy George’s ditty rang loud. 

Agbonlahor beat Foster again shortly after but Joleon Lescott raced back to clear the ball off the line

Foster initially caught the shot from Agbonlahor but it then slipped through his legs and he had to react quickly

In all, he had three shots on target – including the badly fumbled effort by Ben Foster than nearly trickled over the line – which is a significant uplift of recent matches. 

In this statistic, the sequence of his last 12 games reads: 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1. Fantastic figures should Jimmy Anderson be bowling a couple of overs at the death in the World Cup. As shots on target for a Premier League striker? Not so much.

Agbonlahor failed to test the goalkeepers of Newcastle, Chelsea, Arsenal (admittedly as a substitute), Liverpool, Leicester, Crystal Palace, Manchester United (albeit sent off unjustly after 65 minutes) and West Bromwich Albion.

His inability in that period to make a difference in opponents’ penalty areas is symptomatic of Villa’s wider attacking paralysis, stymied by a style that ranked possession over purpose to an adverse extent.

It is hard as a centre-forward to strike for goal if the ball is rarely within 30 yards of the target. Agbonlahor would often operate on the wings under Paul Lambert too.

This is not to absolve the 28-year-old. As one of the club’s senior figures his form has been disappointing, particularly since he signed a new four-year contract last September.

Born locally and graduating from Villa’s youth set up he is a supporter of the club and the depth of his feeling has been clear in his commitment since he broke through to the first team nine years ago.

So it has been odd to see his on-field demeanour at certain times this season, exhibiting none of the vim Villa fans know well.

That was back with a bang against West Brom. Tim Sherwood restored Agbonlahor up front alongside Benteke and allowed for the direct style that suits their attributes.

Agbonlahor found the net for the first time in 14 matches and it proved valuable. Each one of his four Premier League goals has counted for something: a draw against Southampton and wins against Liverpool and Hull, accompanying the West Brom victory. Seven extra points in total.

Sherwood knows the worth of the player whose speed is celebrated in chant. The Villa manager needs to continue utilising his talents for the final 10 Premier League matches to make sure this spark of brilliance does not fizzle out.

Agbonlahor on song means Villa should stay up.
