Manchester United have revived their interest in PSV Eindhoven contract rebel Zakaria Bakkali.

The 18-year-old Belgian winger has been demoted to the PSV B squad this season after refusing to consider new contract talks. His current deal expires in June. 

Bakkali, who has also been watched closely by Liverpool, was set to join Atletico Madrid in the summer, only to pull out amid claims his representatives had held promising talks with United.

United could secure Bakkali on a pre-contract from January 1 ahead of signing him on a Bosman in June.

Meanwhile, Rotherham United have signed Manchester United left back Reece James on an emergency loan deal until January 10.

James impressed during Manchester United's pre-season tour of the US but has not featured under Louis van Gaal since appearing in his side's 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat against MK Dons in August.
