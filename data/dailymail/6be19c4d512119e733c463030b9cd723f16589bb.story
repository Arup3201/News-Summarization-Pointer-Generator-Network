More than 80 cave rescue specialists are fighting to save the life of a man injured by falling rocks in a grotto a kilometre beneath the German Alps.

The rescue could take days, police warned, as experts negotiate a labyrinth of vertical shafts and bottlenecks in the Riesending cave system, near Berchtesgaden, south-east Germany.

Mountain rescue official Klemans Reindl said his colleagues were at work 'in one of the most difficult caves in Europe', access to which is complicated by water and tight spots.

'We have shafts that go straight down 350 metres (1,150 feet), where you have to rappel down and climb back up on a rope,' he told Germany's n-tv television.

A four-member rescue team reached the 52-year-old German cave researcher early today. He had suffered head and upper body injuries a day earlier in a rockfall deep inside the caves.

One of his two companions made a 12-hour solo climb back to the cave entrance to call for help, while the other stayed with him.

The victim is stuck nearly 1,000 metres (3,300ft) beneath the ground. Officials said he is around three miles from the cave entrance. He is believed to be in stable condition.

More than 80 mountain rescuers from numerous countries have been working to free him

Mr Reindl said the cave system has tight spots where only a slim person can squeeze through, and explorers also have to contend with water.

Another mountain rescue official, Stefan Schneider, told a televised news conference that a doctor was in the cave, but it wasn't clear when he could get to the patient.

'It's going round the clock, and it's going to last a few more days,' Mr Schneider said.

Rescuers working in several small teams of up to four people each have laid a telephone line several hundred metres along the route to help with their efforts.

Others have set up camps inside the cave system, which lies on the border with Austria. Fifty-two cave rescue specialists from Bavaria, 28 from Austria and some from Switzerland were at the scene.
