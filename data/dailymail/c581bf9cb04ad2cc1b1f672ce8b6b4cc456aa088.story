The Lib Dems were accused of losing their ‘moral compass’ last night after Lord Rennard was allowed back into the party despite claims he groped a string of women activists.

Alleged victims reacted with fury, saying the party’s reputation had been ‘torn to shreds’ and women would desert it in droves.

It also emerged last night that Lord Rennard will keep his position on an influential party policy committee – and will be free to stand for high office within the party and campaign at next year’s General Election.

Susan Gaszczak today hit out at the decision to clear Lord Rennard of bringing the party into disrepute

Business Secretary Vince Cable said the Lib Dems could still consult Lord Rennard and ‘use his expertise’ in the forthcoming campaign. Mr Cable said: ‘I’m sure people will want to use his expertise. But my understanding is that won’t be in a major full-time role.’

There was outrage at the party’s handling of the announcement, with alleged victims told only moments before the news broke on Twitter, late on Tuesday night.

In a statement, the peer said he was ‘pleased’ with the outcome, stressing that none of the claims against him had been proved.

He even warned media outlets against repeating the accounts of the women who claim he groped them, which he said were ‘defamatory’.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the party had ‘taken a long hard look in the mirror’ over the allegations and insisted changes had been made.

Party officials said Lord Rennard would have no role in the manifesto process nor in the party election campaign. But there will be nothing to stop him campaigning as a Lib Dem supporter and he remains an elected member of the policy committee. 

Lord Rennard was feted by senior party figures because of his skill in masterminding many of the party’s past triumphs at the polling booths, and can now retake his place among the Lib Dem group in the Lords.

He was suspended last year during a disciplinary process after four activists – Bridget Harris, Alison Goldsworthy, Alison Smith and Susan Gaszczak – publicly accused him of touching them inappropriately. In May last year he issued an apology for encroaching on their ‘personal space’ – prompting several of his alleged victims to call for him to be permanently expelled.

After police dropped their probe into the allegations, a QC, Alistair Webster, was asked to produce an independent report.

He concluded that although the evidence against the peer was ‘broadly credible’, the allegations could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt.

Then last night the peer was formally reinstated by a party committee which concluded he had not brought the party into disrepute by refusing to apologise for what happened.

Miss Harris, a former aide to Mr Clegg, said she was ‘very disappointed’ by the decision.

Miss Gaszczak, 42, quit the Lib Dems in fury over the handling of her case. ‘People, especially women, are telling me they will never vote Lib Dem again,’ she said.

‘You are risking a lot when you are a woman when you come forward with a story like this and nothing has happened.

‘We’ve been told we’re “credible” in our claims but then ignored. It’s not like when the party went against its policy on student fees – we’re talking about half the population with women voters. All they have done is pay lip service to those who came forward with claims. 

Mrs Gaszczak, a former ward councillor in Bedfordshire, added: ‘There has been no change in the party, just an awful lot of words and no action. I think he has got away with it – he’s been extremely lucky. I just hope he reflects on it and doesn’t do it to anyone else.

The mother of three said: ‘The party has shown no leadership on this matter. They just don’t have a moral compass when it comes to things like this.

‘I found out about five minutes before it broke on Twitter.’

Another former Lib Dem female worker, who made complaints about Lord Rennard but does not wish to be named, said young women would be reluctant to vote for Mr Clegg.

She said: ‘The parochialism of the party has engineered a no-verdict rule on Rennard, allowing him to get off scot-free.

‘A dubious character had gotten off on a technicality, but his reputation and that of the party has been torn to shreds.

‘Young women will be looking at this and think: “I can’t vote for Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems if this is how they treat women”.’ Mr Clegg acknowledged that many women felt ‘let down’ but insisted the party had changed to ensure complaints would be handled better in the future.

He said: ‘The Liberal Democrats have taken a long, hard look in the mirror since these allegations were made last year and I am confident that the party has changed.

‘It is clear that a number of women in our party felt let down that the party failed to act on their complaints appropriately. I am determined that no member of our party should find themselves in that position again.’

Lord Rennard said: ‘I am pleased that all disciplinary investigations against me have been brought to an end and that the suspension of my party membership has been lifted.’

Friends of Lord Rennard, pictured, said he had been subjected to a 'witch hunt' over the past several months
