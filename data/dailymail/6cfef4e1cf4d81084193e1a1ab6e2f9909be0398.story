A Wisconsin grandmother has been memorialized by her relative using all of her quirks, painting a picture of the woman for those who never met 'Pink'.

Mary 'Pink' Mullaney was 85-years-old when she passed away in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin on September 1, but the obituatary created by her six children and 17 grandchildren makes her seem full of life.

'If you're about to throw away an old pair of pantyhose, stop,' it reads in the opening line.

'We were blessed to learn many valuable lessons from Pink during her 85 years, among them: Never throw away old pantyhose. Use the old ones to tie gutters, child-proof cabinets, tie toilet flappers, or hang Christmas ornaments.'

Woman with quirks: Mary 'Pink' Mullaney's relatives worked together to write an adorable obituary

The lengthy obituary is made up by a 
long list of anecdotal truisms that the grandmother espoused, showing 
her love of both underprivileged humans and scorned animals.

'If
 a possum takes up residence in your shed, grab a barbecue brush to coax
 him out. If he doesn't leave, brush him for twenty minutes and let him 
stay,' the obituary suggests.

Her
 Catholic faith appears to be a constant theme throughout the collection
 of stories, and her funeral was held at her local church on Friday.

Â 'Let
 a dog (or two or three) share your bed. Say the rosary while you walk 
them. Go to church with a chicken sandwich in your purse. Cry at the 
consecration, every time. Give the chicken sandwich to your homeless 
friend after mass,' the obituary read.

'When you learn someone's name, share their patron saint's story, and their feast day, so they can celebrate.'

Frequent visitor: 'Pink' was a devout Catholic and her funeral was held at St. Monica's Catholic Church in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin. She would regularly attend mass with a chicken sandwich in her purse for a homeless friend

Her three surviving siblings live in New 'Joisey' but Mrs Mullaney's children were the ones to write the obituary.

'We wanted it to portray who she was and her love for people and just her funny ways of going about it. She was an extraordinary person in an ordinary way,' her son Kevin Mullaney told ABCNews.com.

One funny example of her child-rearing tactics shows her sense of humor: 'Put picky-eating children in the box at the bottom of the laundry chute, tell them they are hungry lions in a cage, and feed them veggies through the slats'.

The write-up describes her as a warm-hearted person who welcomed 'new friends' to Thanksgiving dinner and was kept busy by a roster of pen pals.

'Take magazines you've already read to your doctors' office for others to enjoy. Do not tear off the mailing label, "Because if someone wants to contact me, that would be nice,"' was another piece of advice.

If you're about to throw away an old pair of pantyhose, stop. Consider: Mary Agnes Mullaney (you probably knew her as "Pink") who entered eternal life on Sunday, September 1, 2013. Her spirit is carried on by her six children, 17 grandchildren, three surviving siblings in New "Joisey", and an extended family of relations and friends from every walk of life.

We were blessed to learn many valuable lessons from Pink during her 85 years, among them: Never throw away old pantyhose. Use the old ones to tie gutters, child-proof cabinets, tie toilet flappers, or hang Christmas ornaments.

Also: If a possum takes up residence in your shed, grab a barbecue brush to coax him out. If he doesn't leave, brush him for twenty minutes and let him stay. Let a dog (or two or three) share your bed. Say the rosary while you walk them. Go to church with a chicken sandwich in your purse. Cry at the consecration, every time. Give the chicken sandwich to your homeless friend after mass.

Go to a nursing home and kiss everyone. When you learn someone's name, share their patron saint's story, and their feast day, so they can celebrate. Invite new friends to Thanksgiving dinner. If they are from another country and you have trouble understanding them, learn to "listen with an accent." Never say mean things about anybody; they are "poor souls to pray for."

Put picky-eating children in the box at the bottom of the laundry chute, tell them they are hungry lions in a cage, and feed them veggies through the slats. Correspond with the imprisoned and have lunch with the cognitively challenged. Do the Jumble every morning.

Keep the car keys under the front seat so they don't get lost. Make the car dance by lightly tapping the brakes to the beat of songs on the radio. Offer rides to people carrying a big load or caught in the rain or summer heat. Believe the hitchhiker you pick up who says he is a landscaper and his name is "Peat Moss." Help anyone struggling to get their kids into a car or shopping cart or across a parking lot.

Give to every charity that asks. Choose to believe the best about what they do with your money, no matter what your children say they discovered online. Allow the homeless to keep warm in your car while you are at Mass. Take magazines you've already read to your doctors' office for others to enjoy. Do not tear off the mailing label, "Because if someone wants to contact me, that would be nice."

In her lifetime, Pink made contact time after time. Those who've taken her lessons to heart will continue to ensure that a cold drink will be left for the overheated garbage collector and mail carrier, every baby will be kissed, every nursing home resident will be visited, the hungry will have a sandwich, the guest will have a warm bed and soft nightlight, and the encroaching possum will know the soothing sensation of a barbecue brush upon its back.

Above all, Pink wrote - to everyone, about everything. You may read this and recall a letter from her that touched your heart, tickled your funny bone, or maybe made you say "huh?"

She is survived by her children and grandchildren whose photos she would share with prospective friends in the checkout line: Tim (wife Janice, children Timmy, Joey, T.J., Miki and Danny); Kevin (wife Kathy, children Kacey, Ryan, Jordan and Kevin); Jerry (wife Gita, children Nisha and Cathan); MaryAnne; Peter (wife Maria Jose, children Rodrigo and Paulo); and Meg (husband David Vartanian, children Peter, Lily, Jerry and Blase); siblings Anne, Helen, and Robert; and many in-laws, nieces, nephews, friends and family too numerous to list but not forgotten.

Pink is reunited with her husband and favorite dance and political debate partner, Dr. Gerald L. Mullaney, and is predeceased by six siblings.

Friends (and strangers she would love to have met) can visit with Pink's family at the Feerick Funeral Home on Thursday, September 5, from 3 until 7 PM with prayer service at 6:45 PM. Mass of the Christian Burial will be celebrated at St. Monica's Catholic Church in Whitefish Bay on Friday, September 6, at 3 PM. Dress comfortably with a splash of pink if you have it. In Pink's memory donations may be made to Dominican High School, 120 E. Silver Spring Dr., Whitefish Bay, WI 53217, or Saint Monica Parish, 160 E. Silver Spring Dr., Whitefish Bay, WI 53217, or any charity that seeks to spread the Good News of Pink's friend, Jesus. Valet Parking in front of the funeral home on Thursday.
