President Obama today presented the Medal of Honor to a Marine who lost an eye and most of his jaw after fearlessly shielding a comrade from a grenade blast in Afghanistan - and told him that his heroism 'will inspire for generations'.

Retired Corporal William 'Kyle' Carpenter, 24, from Flowood, Mississippi, received the nation's top military award in the East Room of the White House, becoming the eighth living recipient for actions in Afghanistan or Iraq.

It comes nearly four years after he threw himself on top of a grenade to save his friend, Lance Cpl. Nicholas 
Eufrazio, while they stood guard on a rooftop in the Helmand province in November 2010.

'Anybody who has had a chance to get to know this young man, you're not going to get a better example of what you want in an American or a marine,' Obama said at the ceremony.

A hero honored: President Obama presented Retired Corporal William 'Kyle' Carpenter, 24, with the Medal of Honor on Thursday - the nation's top military award - for his service in Afghanistan

Proud of his scars: Carpenter lost his right eye and suffered multiple other injuries when he jumped on a grenade to save a comrade in the Helmand Province in 2010. He has since been fitted with a glass eye

'If any American seeks a model of the 
strength and resilience that defines us as a people, I want you to 
consider Kyle... Kyle, you not only saved your brother in arms, you displayed heroism in a blink of an eye that will inspire for generations.'

Carpenter had been in Afghanistan for just five months when enemy forces, hidden behind walls, lobbed three 
grenades into Carpenter's patrol base. One of the grenades injured an Afghan National Army 
soldier, the second did not detonate and the third landed close to Carpenter and Eufrazio.

Carpenter, who was working as a machine gunner, threw himself between the 
grenade and Eufrazio to shield him. The blast deflected down, with 
Carpenter absorbing most of the explosion.

'The man you see before you today should not be alive today,' Obama said at the ceremony. 'Hand grenades are one of the most awful weapons of war... If one lands nearby you have mere seconds to find coverage... Up close it's almost certain death.'

Thankful: Obama shakes hands with Kyle Carpenter, 24, after presenting him with the award on Thursday

Proud: Carpenter, who is from Mississippi, smiles as the president gives him a round of applause

Tribute: Obama said Carpenter would wear the medal for others who'd served and who didn't make it back

While
 Obama has awarded nearly 40 military members with the Medal of Honor, 
Kyle Carpenter will be only the third Marine to receive the Medal of 
Honor since the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.

In 2007, Corporal Jason Dunham
 was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for covering a grenade with
 his body during an attack in Iraq in 2004. He was mortally wounded but 
saved the lived of at least two fellow Marines.

In 2011, Dakota Meyer became
 the first Marine Medal of Honor recipient out of the war in 
Afghanistan. In 2009, he had ignored orders to stay put and fought his 
way into an ambush to help rescue three dozen Afghan and American troops
 and to recover four dead Americans.

Carpenter
 will become the youngest living Medal of Honor recipient when he is 
awarded; currently, the title is held by Meyer, who is 25.

Carpenter was conscious in the moments after the explosion and, believing he was going to die, he made peace with God.

'I
 thought about my family and how devastated they would be that I was 
killed in Afghanistan and never made it home,' Carpenter told Business Insider.

'My
 last thought [was to] make peace with God, because I knew from how I 
felt and how much blood that I could feel I was losing - I knew that I 
was not gonna wake up.'

But
 he did wake up - in a survival that Obama called 'miraculous'.

Eufrazio also survived the attack but
 the frontal lobe of his brain was seriously injured by shrapnel and it 
took him more than two years to be able to talk again.

Carpenter was left with life-changing injuries; he lost his right eye and most of his teeth and suffered a broken jaw and 
arm, which left him heavily scarred.

But Obama pointed out on Thursday that the Marine proudly wears the signs of his service - and even said women loved them.

'I'm
 quoting him,' Obama quipped during his speech. '"The girls definitely 
like them". He's working an angle on this thing. I wasn't sure if i was 
supposed to say this in front of mom,' he said to laughter.

Audience: Mrs Obama joined Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough (2nd L) and other officials for the ceremony in the East Room of the White House

But getting to this point has taken years of doctors at Walter Reed
 National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland putting him back together, Obama said.

After the blast, Carpenter was in a coma for five weeks before undergoing more than 30 surgeries, including brain surgery, and being fitted with a glass eye. He spent two-and-a-half years in hospital.

Yet he's not bitter about it.

'I look back and I'm actually very appreciative I had those two and a half years, because those years put things in perspective more than a whole lifetime of things could if I wasn't there,' Carpenter said, according to the Marine Corps.

Before he received the honor, his doctors from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center said they had been moved by his stoic recovery from injuries that saw his lungs and heart stop several times.

In a moving video tribute, Debra L. 
Malone said he never once complained as he battled for his life and 
always giving 110 per cent during recovery.

Brave: Carpenter, from South Carolina, had been in Afghanistan for 5 months before the explosion

'I
 honestly believe Kyle made an effort to protect his family and his 
fellow marines. I don't think he wanted to see his fellow marines see 
him suffer,' Dr Malone said.

'He
 knew that his fellow marines would be at some point going off to war 
and they might be faced with the same type of challenge. You would never
 know what he's been through. All his injuries have become a part of 
him, and he's proud of his injuries.’

There has been some debate over 
exactly what happened before the explosion, as Carpenter said he was 
unable to remember what had happened and there were no witnesses to the 
event.

But troops have said they have no doubt Carpenter had acted to save his friends life.

Hospitalman
 3rd Class Christopher Frend, who was the first to treat the men, said 
the injuries were consistent with Carpenter covering the grenade.

He added that the part of the grenade that detonated was found beneath Carpenter's torso.

Still smiling: He has undergone 30 surgeries, including on his right arm which broke in numerous places

Fighter: Carpenter, 24, lost his right eye and most of his teeth in the blast. He also suffered a shattered jaw

'Grenade blasts blow up; they don't 
blow down,' Frend told Marine Corps Times in 2012. 'If he hadn't done 
it, what we found would have looked completely different.'

Scars: Carpenter sustained wounds to the right side of his body and now wears a glass eye

Still, the veteran, who had been in 
Afghanistan for five months before the blast, previously told the Washington Post that he 
wasn't comfortable with wearing the Medal of Honor.

'There
 are guys who I was with who didn't come back, so it’s hard for me to 
wear this and have the spotlight on me the rest of my life when they 
lost their life on a hot, dusty field in Afghanistan and most people 
don't even know their names,' he said.

'Even
 at Walter Reed, I recovered with quadruple-amputees. How am I supposed 
to wear this knowing and seeing all the hardships that are much worse 
than mine that guys have gone through without any recognition?'

Even though he has since left the 
Marines, Carpenter has maintained close ties with them and has been 
featured as a guest of honor at several command events.

The Marine has also been celebrated 
as a hero across the nation - appearing on Katie Couric's show to talk 
about his experiences, and garnering thousands of fans on his Facebook 
page.

Carpenter was a patient at Walter Reed until he 
medically retired last July. He is now a student at the University of South Carolina.

Still smiling: On Tuesday, Carpenter visited the Nationals Park ahead of a game against the Houston Astros

Patriot: He holds his arm - which is heavily scarred from his injuries - to his chest during the national anthem

'He
 skis, he snowboards, he's jumped from a plane, he's completed the 
marine corps marathon, he's a motivational speaker, an advocate for his 
fellow wounded warriors,' Obama said.

So far in his presidency, Obama has presented the medal of honor to 39 members of the armed services.

But Corporal Carpenter is just the third Marine to receive the Medal of Honor since the start of the Afghanistan and war in 2001.

Dakota Meyer became the first Marine Medal of Honor recipient from the war in Afghanistan in 2011 and Cpl. Jason Dunham was recognized posthumously for smothering a grenade in Iraq in 2004.
