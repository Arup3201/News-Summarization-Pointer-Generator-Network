This is the terrifying image that plunged the Twitter abuse row to a new low yesterday.

The horror photo of a masked man brandishing a large knife was sent to MP Stella Creasy by an internet troll, who warned her: ‘I’m gonna be the first thing u see when u wake up’.

It is the latest menacing attack on high- profile women on Twitter.

Chilling: An abusive Twitter user has sent this horrible image to a female MP as trolling of women online appears to be getting out of control

Suspended: The man, who goes under the name @Murkztah_ has been thrown off Twitter and reported to police for telling Stella Creasy: 'I'm gonna be the first thing u see when u wake up'

On Sunday, television historian Mary 
Beard was sent a bomb threat, and she and Miss Creasy, 36, have both 
been threatened with rape.

They were targeted because they backed 
campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who received rape threats after she 
led a campaign for women to be featured on bank notes.

Labour MP Miss Creasy, a shadow Home 
Office minister, retweeted the chilling message as an example of what 
trolls have threatened her with. The user who posted the image – 
@Murkztah – has been reported to police and suspended by Twitter.

Miss Beard, a professor of classics 
at the University of Cambridge, contacted police after receiving a 
message claiming a bomb had been left outside her home. Yesterday she 
called for repeated ‘threats of violence and death’ against her and 
other women on Twitter to be distinguished from mere abuse.

Outrage: Stella Creasy is one of several high-profile women threatened with bombing, rape and violence because they backed having Jane Austen on a £10 note

The 58-year-old academic added: ‘I’ve
had lots of abuse, but only recently have I had these things actually 
threatening violence, rape and death.

Professor Mary Beard was sent a bomb threat on Twitter. It is one of many in a series of threats and vulgar insults she has sent

‘I think we’ve got to be quite 
careful about drawing a distinction between those things because abuse 
is very nasty, it’s sexist, it’s misogynist but I think in some ways you
can cope with that . . . [but] these are criminal threats, they are 
threats of violence and death and all you can do is take them to the 
police.’

Prof Beard added: ‘There is no two 
ways about it, threatening to kill someone is a crime.’ Meanwhile, Miss 
Creasy has taken screen grabs as evidence of the vile abuse directed at 
her.

One abuser, calling himself @killcreasynow, threatened to behead the Walthamstow MP and carry out grotesque sexual violence.

Although suspended quickly by 
Twitter, another account called  @eatcreasynow emerged that appeared to 
have been set up by the same person. He gloated: ‘HI AGAIN S***!! IT 
TOOK TWITTER 30 MINUTES TO BAN ME BEFORE . . . I AM HERE AGAIN TO TELL 
YOU I WILL RAPE YOU TOMORROW AT 6PM.’

Another sick user – hiding behind the
pseudonym @rapey1 – said: ‘I will rape you tomorrow at 9pm . . . shall 
we meet near your house?’

Scotland Yard has launched an investigation into allegations of online abuse and threats.
