Global warming has been blamed for polar bears straying into residential areas to scavenge for food in recent years - but strolling through downtown Tokyo seems a stretch too far. 

As does this polar bears placid nature, as it ambles on a leash across a pedestrian crossing at the Shibuya Scramble. 

Footage of the bear and its female handler - a blond in a short skirt - has spread across social media in China as debate has raged about whether the bear is real or not, and just why it is out for a walk.

Crowds gather around the busy crossing to take photos which are quickly uploaded to social media accounts

The stunt was performed by a Russian group called LASH, which is written on the handlers clothes

Most onlookers are convinced that the bear was either a robot or had somebody dressed up in a sophisticated costume underneath, as polar bears have been known to kill humans, and consent to walk the bear on the busy crossing would be unlikely to be granted.

Nevertheless, the debate over whether the polar bear was real or not, did nothing to quell excitement about the unusual happening, or speculation around what the stunt might be promoting. 

The most popular theory was that it was a PR stunt for Lady Gaga, however, others suggested it was to promote everything from ice cream and cosmetics through to global warming.

All that was known was that the woman and the men involved were wearing T-shirts with the words 'LALSH' printed on them. 

It is not known what, if anything, the stunt is promoting but LASH say all will be revealed later this month

The group has a Facebook page which was set up in March, and shows photos of the polar bear being walked in Yokohama where it caused an equal amount of hysteria.

The page, offers little insight into what the organisation is about, but a post says 'all will be revealed' in Shinjuku on October 24. 

As well as pictures of the polar bear, the page also shows those linked to the organisation dressed up in shirts printed with their logo.

Polar bears are not known to be friendly to humans. In the past 20 years, six people have been killed by the animals in Canada alone and recent studies have suggested that attacks are on the rise.

Climate change has been sighted as one of the main causes, as the bears are forced to roam further to find food.
