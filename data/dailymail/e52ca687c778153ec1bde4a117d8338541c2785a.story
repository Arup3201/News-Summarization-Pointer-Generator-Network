Heroic pet: Rachel Hayes, 40, with her five-year-old springer spaniel dog Mollypops, who saved her life

A dog owner revealed today how her pet saved her life by hitting her on the back.

Rachel Hayes, of Carmarthenshire, West Wales, thought she was going to die as she choked on a strawberry sweet while sitting in her kitchen.

But as she gasped for air, the 40-year-old woman's faithful springer spaniel Mollypops sprang into action and hit her so hard on the back with her paws that the sweet popped out.

Miss Hayes said: ‘She is an absolute hero - If it had not been for Mollypops I would have died.

‘I was sat down and this sweet just got stuck in the back of my throat, and I was trying to get it up but I couldn't, and I didn't know what to do.’

Miss Hayes, who lives with Mollypops in the rural village of Drefach Felindre, could not call out.

She said: ‘I couldn't phone anyone because I couldn't talk. I was having difficulty breathing and was doing my best to get it out. But Mollypops's sixth sense kicked in and she knew I was in trouble.

‘I kept pushing her away because I couldn't really breathe but then she came up behind me, put her paws on me, and bashed on my back with such a force that the sweet came out.’

Miss Hayes said she could have died if ‘best friend’ Mollypops had not performed the manoeuvre.

She said: ‘When she forced the sweet out I just burst out crying and said: “I love you”. She came over for a cuddle and I cuddled her. I told her she was a hero.

‘I think she's glad to have me alive otherwise she would have been left all on her own. But I don't think she knows quite what she has done.’

It comes three months after trainee guide dog Nell saved 61-year-old IT technician Lesley Hailwood's life by knocking a chocolate out of her mouth while she was choking on New Year's Eve in Liverpool.

Upon publication this article stated Mollypops had performed the Heimlich manoeuvre on Rachel Hayes. However, it has since been brought to our attention that this was in fact not the manoeuvre used. The article was amended on March 30 to remove references to the manoeuvre.
