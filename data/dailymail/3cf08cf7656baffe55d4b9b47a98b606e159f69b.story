The migrants rescued from a shipping container in a British dockyard were ‘20 minutes from death’, it emerged yesterday.

The 35 Afghan Sikhs had been locked inside the ‘metal coffin’ for 18 hours during their desperate attempt to reach the UK and were beginning to run out of air.

During their terrifying journey on a cargo ferry, one man in his 40s – named last night as Meet Singh Kapoor – died as his wife and their two sons, aged just nine and 12, slept nearby.

The surviving Afghans told rescuers they
 were slowly suffocating before they were freed at the port of Tilbury, 
in Essex, when staff heard screaming and banging coming from inside the 
container.

Kamaljit Singh 
Matharu, who acted as a translator for police, said last night: ‘They 
were 20 minutes from death. One woman told me they were drifting in and 
out of consciousness because they had no air.

‘They
 were banging on the container every hour in the hope that someone would
 hear them during the ferry crossing. But no one heard them. It was 
pitch black, without any air. It soon became extremely uncomfortable. It
 was only by good fortune that they were found in time.’

People-traffickers
 are understood to have taken the 35 migrants – all from Afghanistan’s 
Sikh community – by road in a lorry from Kabul to Europe.

Once inside the EU, they put them in a ‘custom-made’ shipping container before locking them inside.

The
 metal box was modified by the smugglers so that the Afghan families, 
who included 13 children, had separate compartments to sleep in. Boxes 
of cleaning chemicals were piled up round them so they would not be 
found if port officials opened the container for a random search.

from a shipping container, after being discovered

In the footage, the immigrants - now confirmed as Afghan 
Sikhs - can be seen crawling helplessly around the floor, while 
harrowing screams echo around the dock

Police and border officials are seen trying to help the immigrants, as 
several collapse onto the floor, letting out desperate cries for help

Essex police have confirmed the group included nine men and eight women aged between 18 and 72, as well as 13 children, aged between one and 12 years old

Thirteen children, aged as young as one, were among the Afghan Sikhs rescued from a shipping container on Saturday

Some of the survivors, who are aged from one to 72, were so dehydrated that they had to be lifted out by police.

Mr
 Matharu, 46, whose family cut short his daughter’s 21st birthday party 
to help, said: ‘When I went down to see them they were really distressed
 and exhausted. They had been in a container for 18 hours.

‘They
 were in a bad way when I saw them.’

He said all the migrants told him 
they risked their lives because they ‘would rather die than live in 
Kabul any longer’.

Dock
 workers made the shocking discovery at 6.37am on Saturday morning after
 they heard 'screaming and banging' coming from inside one of the ship's
 containers 

A Belgian police spokesman said it would be 'impossible' for the illegal immigrants to have boarded the vessel (pictured at Tilbury Docks yesterday) at Zeebrugge

‘In Kabul 
they were persecuted,’ he said. ‘Their hair would be pulled and their 
clothes tugged if they left the house because they were Sikhs.’

The
 translator was asked by police to gently question the dead man’s sons. 
‘I was asked to find out if their father had paid anyone to get to 
Britain, but they didn’t know,’ he said. ‘I think the police found some 
euros in their father’s pocket.’

The dead man is understood to have a brother who lives in Feltham, West London.

The
 Afghans, who were rescued from the container on Saturday morning, have 
been questioned by police about the smugglers who put them in the 
container.

British detectives have launched a murder inquiry and are working with Interpol in a bid to track down the traffickers.

were treated for severe dehydration and hypothermia after they were 
found 

The
 A&E department of Basildon University Hospital in Essex was closed 
off as a 'decontamination area' as the suspected immigrants were 
treated

A Home Office spokesman last night said all the surviving migrants were now in the process of claiming asylum in the UK.

Two children and an adult from Iran were found in the back of a 
refrigerated lorry close to the French entrance to the Channel Tunnel.

The youngsters – understood to be aged less than ten – sneaked onto the lorry as it prepared to cross to the UK from France.

A
 French source said the three migrants were taken to hospital in Calais 
but did not require medical treatment as they had not been in the truck 
long enough for hypothermia to set in.
