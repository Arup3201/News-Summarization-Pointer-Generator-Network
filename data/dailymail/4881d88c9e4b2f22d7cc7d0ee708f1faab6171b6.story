Dozens of people rolled up their sleeves yesterday in Mexico City to help create a monster sandwich.

Measuring an impressive 53-metres in length (173-feet) the massive sandwich didn't break the world record, but still manged to become the biggest that Latin America has ever created.

Local authorities and 55 local business rolled up their sleeves to prepare the sandwich - known as 'torta' in Mexico.

Thousands of pieces of bread, lettuce, onion and tomato were mixed with more than 70 ingredients, including hundreds of litres of mayonnaise, mustard and spicy sauces.

Each section of the 700 kg (154 lb) super torta had a different flavour cooked up by local chefs.

Organised by local government in the Mexican capital, officials hope the mammoth sandwich will give the nutritious Mexican torta a much-needed boost in sales as it struggles to compete with imported fast food chains.

'What we are trying to do is to support the social development of small businesses which are normally family businesses.

'In the last ten years, the sale of the torta has fallen 60 percent due to foreign fast food which does not have the same nutritional value of the torta,' said local government official, Elena Edith Segura Trejo.

Despite its super size, the sandwich didn't quite make it into the big league of sandwiches.

Breaking bread: Pieces of the gigantic torta were handed out to the hungry crowd for free

According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the largest sandwich ever made was in 2005 in the United States and weighed 2,467.5 kg (5,440 lb), while the honour of the longest sandwich goes to two Italians who constructed a sandwich over 630 metres (2066 feet) long in 2004.

For organisers, the sandwich exceeded the record they set one year ago when they prepared a baguette some three metres (9 feet) shorter than Wednesday's (August 01) effort.

'It's great that they broke the record; I think it was 53 metres and the torta is very tasty,' said fair participant, Ivon.

With large crowds waiting for a taste of the mammoth sandwich, torta lover Paulina Barrera gave chefs the thumbs up for their creation.

'It was worth waiting; it is delicious. I'm eating the turkey, delicious, very good,' she said.

The long torta challenge is part of a three-day fair that looks to support the traditional Mexican sandwich and more than 20,000 local businesses across the country dedicated to producing the delicious baguette.

Event organisers expect more than 350,000 visitors during the fair and hope to sell hundreds of thousands of tortas.
