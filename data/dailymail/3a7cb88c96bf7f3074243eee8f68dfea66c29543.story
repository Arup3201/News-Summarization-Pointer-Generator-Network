Within a month of Apple's latest handsets going on sale, figures have revealed its customers flocked to buy the smaller model.

The iPhone 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through September and into early October, while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent.

Apple's cheaper iPhone 5S and 5C handsets made up the rest of the sales.

Following last year's launch, the 5S and 5C accounted for 84 per cent of total iPhone sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular.

The skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the iPhone 6 Plus are lower because Apple is struggling to complete orders.

The figures come from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIPR) analyst Steven Milunovich. 

He also noted that more people are buying larger models of the devices, in terms of storage, with the average capacity reported as 48GB. 

As Apple Insider points out, this is almost double last year's figure, but may be due to the fact Apple has removed the 32GB model from the range, offering a 16GB, 64GB and 128GB as standard. 

A separate CIPR report, from analysts Joshua Lowitz and Michael Levin, found that fewer people switched from Android to iOS this year, compared to last year. 

In September 2013, 23 per cent of iPhone customers said they had previously owned an Android phone, but this year the figure was closer to 12 per cent.

A separate CIPR report, from analysts Joshua Lowitz and Michael Levin, found that fewer people switched from Android to iOS this year, compared to last year. 

In September 2013, 23 per cent of iPhone customers said they had previously owned an Android phone, but this year the figure was closer to 12 per cent. 

But, it explained that although there were fewer people making the switch, those who did, chose the more expensive iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models, rather than the iPhone 5C and 5S. 

Typically, Android owners opt for cheaper iPhones - but this year was an exception. 

Last month, T-Mobile boss chief executive John Legere said the iPhone 6 Plus was 'exceeding expectations' - and was on par with the smaller iPhone 6 model.

He said he had expected the Plus model to make up around 20 per cent of sales, but this figure has been closer to 45 per cent.

Mr Legere was talking at Recode’s Code/Mobile event in Moon Bay California.

He admitted the figures were more than twice the sales his firm had expected.

These figures bolster those observed on the weekend the two devices were released back in September.

A Piper Jaffray survey found the larger model was outselling the smaller version, and analyst Gene Munster said at the time the Plus was ‘more popular’.

Following the launch, Apple reported it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models (pictured) in a weekend - a three-day record for a new model. This beat the previous record of 9 million for last year's iPhone 5S and 5C. The 5S and 5C accounted for 84 per cent of total iPhone sales in the first 30 days in 2013

In a survey, 57 per cent of shoppers intended to buy the iPhone Plus; with the larger screen, as well as the storage options, cited as the main driving forces.

The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, while the iPhone 6 Plus 5.5-inches.

Both models include the Apple-designed A8 chip with second generation 64-bit desktop-class architecture, said to boost performance and power efficiency.

They also have advanced iSight and FaceTime HD cameras, and users in the US can also to use the devices to pay for goods using Apple Pay.

Besides larger screens, the new phones offer faster performance and a wireless chip for making credit card payments.

In the US, the iPhone 6 starts at $199 for 32GB on a two-year contact, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB.

A SIM-only handset starts at £539 in the UK.

The iPhone 6 Plus costs $299 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $399 for 64GB, $499 for 128GB.

Unlocked, the handset starts at £619 in the UK. 

Prior to the release, the firm said it expected customers would ‘overwhelmingly’ prefer the smaller iPhone 6 - seen as the direct upgrade to the iPhone 5S.

Figures from marketing firm Localytics earlier this month, however, reported a skew in the opposite direction.

By studying app usage and analytics across a range of devices, its figures show the iPhone 6 taking 6 per cent market share, compared to the Plus model’s one per cent.

The firm also found that the iPhone 6 is being adopted at twice the rate of its iPhone 5S predecessor - which had a three per cent share of all iPhones at this time last year.

Although people who have bought the larger model are using it more.

According to Localytics, the iPhone 6 Plus has ‘stronger user engagement’ with 13 per cent longer session length, and 11 per cent more app launches than the iPhone 6.

Currently, last year’s iPhone 5S is the most popular model among consumers at 27 per cent of all iPhones. 

Following the launch in September, Apple reported it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models over the first weekend - a three-day record for a new model. 

This beat the previous record of 9 million for last year's iPhone 5S and 5C.

According to app analytics firm Localytics, the iPhone 6 Plus has ‘stronger user engagement’ than its smaller cousin, with 13 per cent longer session length, and 11 per cent more app launches than the iPhone 6

During initial benchmark tests by Anandtech, the iPhone 6 was found to have the fastest web browsing and page loading times on any device, just ahead of the iPhone 6 Plus.

The iPhone 6 also performed well in graphics testing, coming second with an average frame per second rate of 49.5. This was only behind the NVIDIA Shield tablet, on 57.1.

The iPhone 5S was third, on 40.2, followed by the iPhone 6 Plus on 34.4.

Furthermore, the display on the iPhone 6 Plus was praised by experts at DisplayMate, who called the screen ‘the best performing smartphone LCD’ the site has ever tested.

Separate figures from Localytics report a sales skew in the same direction. By studying app usage and analytics across a range of devices, its figures show the iPhone 6 taking six per cent market share, compared to the Plus model’s one per cent (pictured)
