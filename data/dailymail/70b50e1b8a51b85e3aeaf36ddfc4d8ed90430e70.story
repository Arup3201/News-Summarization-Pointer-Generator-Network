These breathtaking photos show groups of hikers who really aren't afraid of living on the edge.

They are standing on a well-known spot called Trolltunga - Troll's Tongue in English - which is located in southern Norway and is named so because of its bizarre shape.

As they pose for the unique souvenir photos, the pranksters are dwarfed by the immense scale and beauty of the sub-Arctic landscape arrayed before them.

Each photo features hikers striking a pose with a stunning view of the Norwegian Fjords in the background.

But only those with brave hearts have the courage to stand or sit on the edge of this outcrop, which sticks out into space 1,150ft above the cold waters below.

The incredible images were taken by hiking guide Jostein Soldal, who has been taking photos of tourists he's taken to the scenic spot for the past four years.

'Since 2009, we have arranged guided hikes to Trolltunga,' he said.

On the top we arrange a photo shoot, and take pictures of the participants posing on the Trolltunga.

'It seems like the groups then challenge and inspire each other to come up with better or funnier pictures.'

Jumping for joy: Three happy hikers click their heels Hollywood style after reaching Trolltunga, which is an eight to ten hour trek from the nearest town

Mr Soldal, 42, has even captured a wedding proposal on the rocky outcrop.

'The tourist track to Trolltunga starts in Skjeggedal and it usually takes 8-10 hours to do this hike, most people do this hike without a guide,' he added.

'I really like the photos where big groups of people are jumping and you capture the perfect moment mid-air.

'It's a shame sometimes that it's so cloudy because when it's blue sky its absolutely beautiful.'
