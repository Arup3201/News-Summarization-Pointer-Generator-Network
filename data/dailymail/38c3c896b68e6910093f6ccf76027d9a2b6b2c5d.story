Serena Williams has spoken of her close friendship with tennis rival Caroline Wozniacki.

Appearing on the front cover of US Vogue, the American world No 1 admits that times can get tough at the top and that she is glad to have Wozniacki and sister Venus around for support.

'It’s hard and lonely at the top,' Serena confessed to Vogue. 'That’s why it’s so fun to have Caroline and my sister, too. You’re a target when you’re number one. Everyone wants to beat you. Everyone talks behind your back, and you get a lot more criticism. God forbid I lose.'

Last May, it was Caroline who needed Serena's support. When Serena got word that Caroline had been dumped by fiance Rory McIlroy, she immediately picked up the phone.

'I was devastated. I had planned the bachelorette party,' Williams said.

Serena and Caroline both sat down to chat about the event six months after the fact. 

'My phone was going crazy, but I didn’t want to talk to anyone,' said Caroline. 

'I kept calling,' Serena said.

'First she texted, "If you don’t pick up, I am going to fly to Monaco." And then, "If you don’t answer the door, I am going to knock it down."

'So I thought, OK, I better answer the phone. And I am so glad I did. She wasn’t pitying me, like a lot of people were. I mean, it’s not like anyone died.'

Wozniacki added: 'I was in shock, but she was really helpful because she had been through it before. She didn’t sugarcoat it, and she didn’t look down on me.

'She was really there for me when I needed her the most, and that’s why I think our friendship is so strong now.' 

'I was impressed with how strong she was,' Serena said, before continuing: 'And you know, there will be other engagement parties... many.'

Serena indicated that Caroline won't have problems finding another guy, as they literally swarm her when the girls go out at night.

'I am really shy. I don’t talk to guys,' Serena conceded. And although she had once wished for a family and children of her own some day, she's not in any particular hurry.

'I guess,' she said. 'I’m not even looking for it.'

On the court, it's a different story.

Serena went on to say: 'On the court, I am fierce! I am mean and I am tough. I am completely opposite off the court. My confidence just isn’t the same. I wish I was more like I am on the court. Nobody would know that I am constantly crying or complaining.'

Williams said: 'On the court, I am fierce! I am mean and I am tough. I am completely opposite off the court'
