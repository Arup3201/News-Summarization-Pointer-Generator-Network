Bastian Schweinsteiger started on the bench against Manchester City but the match still allowed him to renew an old acquaintance with Frank Lampard. 

The pair's mutual admiration is well documented and they swapped shirts after the infamous 4-1 England defeat in Bloemfontein 2010. 

Schweinsteiger was later pictured playing football in a public park in Munich wearing Lampard's shirt.

Champions League fever is yet to sweep through the Etihad. There might at least have been a capacity crowd for the visit of the 2013 winners but the build-up was distinctly flat, more akin to a Capital One Cup tie. 

City's grandiose pre-match film boasts of a 'thunderclap of noise' which will greet the team. 'Smattering of polite applause' would be nearer the mark.

Manchester City fans have yet to embrace the Champions League, which is evident from crowds at the Etihad

The most passionate the City fans do get is when the UEFA Champions League anthem is played - which is roundly booed, adding to the sense of dislocation from the tournament. 

It seems the grievances with Michel Platini's financial fair play regulations and the perceived injustice over the CSKA fan ban in Moscow - which saw locals manage to breach the prohibition of fans - still runs deep.

Manchester City and Premier League clubs can only look on enviously as Bayern Munich plan their month-long winter break, with a holiday followed by a Qatar training camp. 

Meanwhile, City contemplate games against Crystal Palace, WBA, Burnley, Sunderland and the FA Cup third round in a two-week spell. 

One of these nations is the second-most successful World Cup football team of all time; the other is England.
