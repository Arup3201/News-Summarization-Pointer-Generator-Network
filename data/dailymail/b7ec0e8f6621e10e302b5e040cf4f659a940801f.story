Even the world-renowned composer himself might have struggled to orchestrate better than Arsenal's 'Little Mozart' on his day.

Rosicky earned that nickname during his five years with Borussia Dortmund, yet it was in Germany where he was labelled 'wasted talent' and Arsenal gladly signed the maestro in May 2006.

'When he is fit...' seem to be the same, old four words that crop up when Rosicky becomes the topic of discussion yet, even at the age of 34, he still knows how to make Arsenal tick.

Rosicky has found minutes hard to come by at Arsenal previously but injuries can prove problematic

Pulling on the yellow of Dortmund from 2001, the all-round midfielder's potential was recognised.

Remember Nike's Scorpion advert in 2002? 

Francesco Totti, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Luis Figo and Ronaldinho, among others, playing in a 'secret tournament' hosted by Eric Cantona. 

Then, among the world's finest footballers, was a 20-something Rosicky. 

More than a decade on he is in his mid-thirties, and getting better with age. 

Take the former Sparta Prague youth's cameo against Everton on March 1, for example.

There was a moment when Rosicky chased the ball from Phil Jagielka, to Ross Barkley, to Steven Naismith, then back to Barkley, and won the tackle. It merited a standing ovation, before he settled the bag of nerves the Emirates Stadium had become with an 89th-minute goal to make it 2-0.

'This geezer's unreal, how is he 34? Still producing moments of class like that, he's a brilliant player,' one supporter said in his analysis on ArsenalFanTV afterwards.

Rosicky should start against Manchester United but is not guaranteed to do so under Wenger

87 - vs QPR (March 4)

8 - vs Everton (March 1)

9 - vs Monaco (February 25)

14 - vs Crystal Palace (February 21)

18 - vs Middlesbrough (February 15)

That's exactly how it comes – in 'moments'. The Czech Republic captain doesn't devastate week in, week out yet he is guaranteed to put in a shift.

The mentality to pass sideways is lost on Rosicky, who prefers to move the ball quickly and forward, showing as much energy and pace as those with years on him in the Premier League.

Yet Rosicky – a one-two kind of player, who bleeds the Arsenal way – has averaged just 19 games per Barclays Premier League season under Wenger in his nine years in north London.

The injury-prone playmaker has been unlucky, rupturing his knee tendon in 2008 before requiring surgery on an Achilles tendon in 2012. 

It cost him more than two years, and a niggle has always seemed to be round the corner since.

Minutes have been hard to come by. Eighteen against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup, 14 against Crystal Palace in the Premier League, and just nine in the 3-1 defeat by Monaco in the Champions League at the Emirates.

His eight minutes against Everton led to a rare start against Queens Park Rangers, and Wenger should persist with the playmaker.

There is no doubt the Arsenal manager likes the man due a testimonial next year if he signs a contract extension. 'If you love football, you love Rosicky,' purred Wenger after their 3-2 win against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup fourth round.

Rosicky treated that match as an exhibition. His assist for Mesut Ozil's first half goal was ridiculous enough before a no-look pass led to a one-two that allowed Rosicky to score a volley in the second.

You may remember it better for Phil Neville declaring he would 'two-foot him' if he tried that in his neck of the woods, but most saw it as sheer class from a thinker that views football akin to chess.

During interviews Rosicky can look uneasy, like a teenager making a television debut, not a player just one cap short of a century for Czech Republic. Modesty, can be another way to put it.

This week we heard Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 33, has years left. Can Rosicky keep being his tireless self? 

Well, a Jaguar Land Rover may be aged but, when it's only got so many miles on the clock, it runs as good as any. Rosicky has been seen to by mechanics on the treatment table far more than he deserves but, with him now fit, Wenger should start the 34-year-old against Manchester United on Monday, then watch him go.
