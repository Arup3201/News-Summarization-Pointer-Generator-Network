Too frightened to talk to strangers, Owen Howkins had become a withdrawn little boy who hated being in public because of his rare genetic disorder.

But the eight-year-old has overcome his anxiety with the help of a three-legged dog who has 'changed his life'.

The pair have become inseparable after the family pet helped Owen - who suffers from a rare genetic disorder - overcome his nerves around strangers.

Heartwarming: A book has now been written about how the pair have become inseparable

The true story of Haatchi and Little B is a heartwarming novel about the pair's friendship

And now the youngster has helped pen a book - called Haatchi and Little B - about how the dog has completely transformed his life.

Owen told ITV's This Morning: 'He's my best friend in the whole world.'

Speaking about the moment he met Haatchi, he said: 'He put his head on my lap and that's how we became best friends forever.'

The story of how the pair have become firm friends describes how Owen became 'withdrawn' at school when he realised a rare genetic condition made him different to other boys and girls.

It left him scared to talk to people and worried about leaving his home in Basingstoke, Hampshire.

But now the little boy has flourished after Haatchi - an Anatolian shepherd dog - has given Owen a new lease of life.

Speaking on This Morning on ITV, the confident schoolboy now says his life has transformed because of his pet. 

He said: 'I used to be scared of strangers and I used to put head (down) like that before Haatchi came.

'But when Haatchi came I wasn't scared.

'He changed how I felt about being in a wheelchair. He's special because he changed my life.'  

Owen suffers from Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, which means his muscles are always tense.

The schoolboy's father, Will Howkins, 
adopted the pet from a rescue centre. The pair can be seen walking down 
the road together after becoming the best of friends.

Will said that when he and Owen’s step-mother, Colleen Drummond, went to get the dog they did not know it would have such a strong impact on their boy, explaining that they wanted Haatchi as a dog for the family.

‘We had no idea that it was going to help Owen,’ he told MailOnline.

‘About three weeks after we brought Haatchi home Owen wanted to take him for a walk in his wheelchair.

‘That day he was still hiding in his wheelchair. But he got more confident when people were complimenting his dog and then he realised that people were looking at Haatchi more than him in his wheelchair.’

Will said that he and Colleen were initially hesitant to go about writing a book but decided to try it after Owen and Haatchi’s victory at Crufts.

‘We spoke to Owen about it and he loved the idea. And that’s how it started,’ Will said.

‘He likes the fact he is now an author and he is thrilled by it. He loves the fact people are able to read about his syndrome and understand it.’

Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, which is an inherited disorder, causes muscle stiffness and weakness.

There are two types of Schwartz-Jampel syndrome – one which becomes apparent in later childhood, and another which is apparent at birth.

The disease, which cannot be relieved by medication or sleep, leaves muscles permanently tense.

Other symptoms can include joint deformity, a curved spine and a short stature.

Speaking about his decision to bring Haatchi into the family, Will said: ‘It was more he chose us than we chose him.

‘At
 the foster home, they brought Haatchi in and he came bounding up to her (Colleen). And it was the first time he had wagged his tail since the 
operation.

‘She broke down and had to persuade me to take him – and it didn’t take a huge amount of persuading.’

Haatchi himself had a difficult start 
in life, suffering horrific injuries when he was tied to a railway line 
and hit by a train. He was found days later, cowering, with a mangled tail and back leg.

By the time he was taken to a vet's surgery, nothing could be done to save his leg and tail and both had to be amputated.

Haatchi's future looked bleak as the RSPCA and UK German Shepherd rescue centre struggled to find him new home.

But he was eventually adopted by father Will and his wife Colleen Drummond who read about the animal's plight on Facebook.

Colleen, who has been part of the family 
since Owen was three, said: 'As soon as they met, the effect Haatchi had
 on Owen was incredible.

The dog and boy quickly became inseparable and Owen now loves taking Haatchi to dog shows

The family pet helped Owen - who suffers from a rare genetic disorder - overcome his nerves around strangers

'Before his arrival, Owen didn't like going out.

'When he first started school, he became more aware of being different, and he became even more withdrawn.'

Owen's condition requires regular hospital treatment but the simple joy of being around the 'energetic puppy' makes it easier for him to cope with.
