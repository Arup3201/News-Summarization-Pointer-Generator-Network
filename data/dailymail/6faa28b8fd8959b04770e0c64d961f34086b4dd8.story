If you're horrified by the piles of wrapping paper discarded after the Christmas morning frenzy, now you don't have to feel so guilty.

A Gloucester-based design group has created Christmas gift wrap that is embedded with vegetable seeds so that you can bury it and grow your own food.

The company, BEAF, is currently raising funds to launch its £5 sheets of ‘Eden’s Paper’ before Christmas in flavours including onion, broccoli, chilli, tomato or carrot.

A Gloucester-based design company has launched an ingenious Christmas wrapping paper laced with vegetable seeds that can be planted after use rather than thrown away

The group created the wrapping paper in an effort to reduce the problem of waste it creates during the holiday season.

Last year, it was estimated that 227,000 miles of wrapping paper went to waste in the UK alone - enough to wrap the world nine times.

Each 27 inch by 17 inch sheet has around 700 seeds nestled in rows between layers of tissue paper embossed to hold them in place

‘Despite everyone's best intentions the vast majority of wrapping paper at Christmas and birthdays ends up in the bin,’ said BEAF’s Nikolas Venios.

‘We wanted to do something to change that, so we have come up with a wrapping paper that contains vegetable seeds in it.

‘Instead of throwing it away you can plant it. It's a way of giving something to the consumer and giving something back to the planet.’

The seeds are in rows down the paper to create a row of vegetables in group.

The paper is 100 per cent biodegradable, no glue is used and even the ink is made from vegetables.

‘The paper comes in five varieties of vegetable and we're looking to expand it to include herbs, fruit and wild flowers,’ said Mr Venios.

‘It's cheaper than luxury wrapping paper and it's almost like giving a person a second present in the form of a plant.’
