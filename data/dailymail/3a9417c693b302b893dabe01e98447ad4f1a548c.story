If apps designed especially for couples weren’t bad enough, a New York-based firm has created a way for people in relationships to ‘touch’ their partners even when they’re apart. 

The TapTap wristbands are sold in pairs and one is worn by each member of a couple. 

When one person taps their wristband, the other person’s band vibrates to the same pattern - either as way of letting them know they’re thinking of them, or to communicate discreet messages.

Dimensions: 49 x 18 x 12 mm

Wristband width: 24mm

Weight: 30g

Battery: 80 mAh with up to seven days use on a single charge

Charging time: 80 minutes

Smartphone compatibility: iPhone 4s, iPhone 5 and above, any Android Smartphone with Bluetooth 2.1 and above

Colours: Black, blue, orange, silver, yellow and pink

Each band is said to last around seven days on one charge and includes LED lights to remind people of missed taps.

TapTap is the brainchild of designers Woodenshark and the firm has created a Kickstarter campaign to get funding for the product.

A pair of wristbands costs $130 (£80) and are fitted with a capacitive sensor and accelerometers to sense the taps. 

To connect a pair of wristbands, users need to download a free smartphone app to their Android or iOS device and enter their email addresses. 

The app also also lets users send and receive taps from their phone.

The majority of the band is made of hypoallergenic plastic with a silicon TapSpot on the top. Each member of a couple is called a TapMate.

According to the firm’s Kickstarter page: ‘TapTap connects you and your beloved one as if you never left each other. It is a way to say the most important thing to the most important person.

‘Your beloved is the only one who will feel that you touched your wristband. No matter how far away you are from each other, it feels like you just touched his hand.

'Two TapTap wristbands are connected only to each other, same as you two are.’

The company claim that a couple could use the wristbands to create secret languages, or send messages similar to Morse Code.

‘It is your secret language, whether you
want to say “I love you”, “I miss you”, “I’m thinking of you”, or “I’m 
waiting for you”’, continued Woodenshark.

Future models of the wristband, pictured, could be connected to game controllers, to record movement for example, or smart alarms to wake people up in the morning. Woodenshark is asking for $130,000 (£80,800) funding via a Kickstarter campaign and have currently raised $79,000 (£49,000)

The campaign ends on Friday and, if successful, the first bands will be shipped shortly after initially in the U.S. and Europe. Later batches will be available in China.
