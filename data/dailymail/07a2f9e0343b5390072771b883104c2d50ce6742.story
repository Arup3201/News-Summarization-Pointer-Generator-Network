This is the dramatic moment when a drunk driver's car barrel-rolled through the air, demolished a wall and landed right way up on a garden lawn.

CCTV footage from a neighbouring house captured the incredible crash of Eliot Nutt’s blue Peugeot 206 after he lost control following a night out drinking.

The 20-year-old, who walked away amazingly uninjured, was found to be almost twice the legal drink-drive limit when he crashed his car in Marlow, Berkshire, magistrates heard today.

Airborne automobile: Eliot Nutt's incredible crash, where he ran into a garden wall and flipped his car just outside a house, was captured on CCTV

Safe landing: After smashing through two garden walls and flipping, the Peugeot 206 incredibly landed right way up and Nutt was amazingly uninjured

The footage shows an approaching car breaking hard as the driver sees Nutt’s car travelling toward him.

Moments later Nutt's Peugeot swerves and the bonnet ploughs into a garden wall before flipping and smashing into another wall and landing right way up.

Severe swerve: A car was seen breaking (far right) as Nutt's car swerves and ploughs into the garden wall after dropping his friends off after a night drinking

Drink-driving: Nutt's car then becomes airborne in the crash in which he admitted a single charge of drinking excess alcohol

Not okay: Nutt said in court today that he thought he was okay to drive 'but clearly I wasn't'. He told police at the time that he had his last drink at 11pm

Disqualified: Nutt was disqualified from driving for 18 months, but could have it reduced by four months if he completes a drink drivers' rehabilitation course

Nutt admitted a single charge of driving with excess alcohol at Amersham 
Magistrates Court in Amersham, Buckinghamshire.

The man from Caversham, Berkshire, 
said: ‘I was driving some friends home from Reading who had no way of 
getting back and I thought I was doing them a favour.

‘I thought I was okay to drive, but clearly I wasn’t.’

The court heard that Nutt had just dropped off his friends and was heading home at 6.50am on October 28.

Nutt said: ‘I had all the heaters on fall blast and I just lost control.’

When
interviewed by police, he told officers that he had last had a drink at 11pm the 
previous evening but he failed a roadside breath test with a reading of 
61mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mg.

Andy Callander, prosecuting, told how residents were alerted to a loud bang outside their houses.

He said: ‘The vehicle collided with the outer wall of numbers 57 and 59.

‘It then rolled over and landed in the garden of number 59.’

Presiding magistrate Frank Hawkins 
disqualified Nutt from driving for 18 months but told him that it could be reduced by four months if he completed a drink drivers’ 
rehabilitation course by November next year.

He also fined him £110, and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a £20 victim surcharge.

On
passing sentence Mr Hawkins said: ‘It is very important that you 
release the offence of drink-driving is very serious and you must follow
the disqualification rules.’

Nutt represented himself during the short hearing.
