Police have seized yet another supercar after its driver collided with a cyclist and was found to be uninsured.

The £170,000 McLaren M4, which can go from 0-60mph in just three seconds, was taken off the road on Old Street in central London last week.

A 41-year-old cyclist was taken to a nearby hospital with minor injuries, while the driver will be punished because he lacked the appropriate insurance.

The MP4, also known as the 12C, has a top speed of 204mph and is the first production car designed by McLaren since its famous F1 model from 1998.

 Last month a Lamborghini Aventador, worth £400,000, was seized and towed away by police after they found that its driver's insurance policy did not cover him to be behind its wheel.

After another case last week, it appears that people owning them may be unaware they require extra insurance to drive one.

'No arrests were made'.
