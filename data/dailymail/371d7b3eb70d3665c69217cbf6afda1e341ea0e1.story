The home towns of the terrorists responsible for last week's attacks in France do not want to bury the gunmen amid fears their graves will become shrines for Islamic extremists. 

Town officials have admitted they want to 'avoid' burying Said and Cherif Kouachi, behind the massacre at Charlie Hebdo, and Amedy Coulibaly, shot dead after a siege at a Jewish deli in Paris.

Under French law, the burials must take place either in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed.

Concerns are growing over where the terrorists responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre will be buried, with towns fearing the graves of Cherif (left) and Said Kouachi (right) could become Islamic extremist shrines

The hometown of Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four in the kosher deli in eastern Paris before being killed in a hail of police gunfire, isn't keen to bury the terrorist

The Kouachi brothers were shot dead by the police as they charged out of a printworks in Dammartin-en-Goele, north east of Paris, meaning they could be buried nearby.

Their father died when they were young and they were taken into care, meaning they have no immediate family who wish to organise a possible funeral and burial elsewhere.

A spokesman for Dammartin-en-Goele's local council told The Times: 'If we have to bury them here, we will obey the law, but we'd rather avoid it.'

Chérif Kouachi lived in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris, and his brother lived in  Reims, northeastern France.

Both town councils refused to comment but it is understood that they want to avoid the terrorists being buried in their regions.

Coulibaly died in a hail of police gunfire in Paris after murdering four of his hostages at the kosher supermarket.

Funerals were held today for some of those killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack, including police officer Franck Brinsolaro

Officers applauded when the coffin of Brinsolaro was carried out of a church draped in the French flag

Hundreds gathered outside the town hall of Montreuil, Paris, for the funeral of Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac

He lived in Fontenay-aux-Roses, a Paris suburb. A spokesman for the town's mayor said: 'If his family decide to bury him here, I don't think we'll be able to avoid it. The law is strict. But we hope he will be buried somewhere else.'

Meanwhile funerals are being held for staff killed in the attack on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo amid continued demand for its first edition since the massacre killed 12 people.

Hundreds gathered for the ceremonies for Franck Brinsolaro, the killed police officer whose job it was to guard Charlie Hebdo editor and cartoonist Stéphane 'Charb' Charbonnier.

Policemen broke into applause as the coffin of Mr Brinsolaro was carried into a church in the town of Bernay this morning.

Otter funerals to take place were those of cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac and psychoanalyst and Charlie Hebdo columnist Elsa Cayat.
