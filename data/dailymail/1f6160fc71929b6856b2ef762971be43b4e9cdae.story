James Dasaolu has been selected to run the 100 metres at August’s European Championships but Chijindu Ujah - the only British man to break 10 seconds this season - must make do with a relay spot.

Dasaolu, 26, has convinced the selectors of his fitness after running 10.03secs in each of his two races so far this season, but 20-year-old Ujah will only compete in the 4 x100m despite clocking 9.96secs last month.

Both sprinters have already missed out on selection for the Commonwealth Games, meaning Ujah will not run an individual event at a major championships in his breakthrough year.

Gunning for gold: Dasaolu has been handed the third and final 100m spot for the European Championships

Relay spot: Despite running 9.96secs this season, Chijindu Ujah must settle for a 4x100m place

Dwain Chambers and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey were already assured of the other two 100m spots after finishing first and second at the Sainsbury’s British Championships, while Adam Gemili has opted to contest the 200m along with James Ellington and Danny Talbot.

Double Olympic and world champion Mo Farah remains a serious doubt for the Commonwealth Games, but has been selected to run in the 5,000m and 10,000m in Zurich next month.

World 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu will only run in the 4x400m at the Commonwealths, but has been picked for the individual event at the European Championships, while former world 400m hurdles gold medallist Dai Greene has also been selected although he has not run the ‘A’ qualifying standard.

Former world triple jump champion Phillips Idowu returns to the British team for his first major championships since London 2012.

Picked: Katerina Johnson-Thompson achieved a personal best in the long jump in Glasgow on Friday

Katarina Johnson-Thompson, 21, will only contest the long jump after she attempts to win heptathlon gold in Glasgow, while 17-year-old Morgan Lake will compete in the high jump in Zurich after completing the heptathlon at the World Junior Championships in Oregon, USA.

There is also a place in the British team for 19-year-old Matthew Hudson-Smith, who will compete in the 400m and 4x400m relay, after the teenager ran the second quickest time in Europe as he set a new personal best of 44.97secs last weekend.

British Athletics performance director Neil Black said: ‘The fact that there were so many tough selection choices reflects on the depth and strength we have in some events this summer.

‘It is great to see young talent coming through such as Morgan Lake in the high jump and Matthew Hudson Smith in the men’s 400m.

Confident: Performance Director Neil Black has high hopes for British team at European Championships

'At the same time, the calibre of individuals such as Dai, Chrissy and Goldie Sayers in the javelin will ensure the team has a bedrock of championship experience within it.

‘There is an expectation for members of this team to be winning medals or challenging hard at the top end in their finals with youngsters coming through from junior ranks and our experienced medallists performing as strongly as they have in previous years.

‘I’m genuinely excited as to the strength of the team headed for Zurich and looking forward next month’s championships in Switzerland.'
