Sir Jimmy Savile was labelled ‘one of the most prolific sex offenders of all time’ last night as police prepared to arrest his suspected accomplices.

Surviving celebrities and former BBC staff linked to the entertainer will be questioned.

Police now believe more than 200 people may have fallen victim to the Top of the Pops presenter and other predators.

Criminal investigation: Scotland Yard has identified more than 200 potential victims of shamed Top of the Pops star Jimmy Savile

Involved? Claims have also emerged about fellow entertainer Gary Glitter - real name Paul Gadd

Detectives confirmed yesterday they have received growing evidence of rape and other sexual assaults by other alleged offenders that must be formally investigated.

Those who face questioning may include disgraced pop star Gary Glitter.

Another man facing arrest is one of Savile’s BBC staff who is accused of raping a former beauty queen and working as an accomplice for the Jim’ll Fix It star.

The woman was 23 when she had consensual sex with Savile in his caravan in 1970 after writing to him asking for work experience. A week later she was invited back to the BBC by his colleague where he violently attacked her in a locked storeroom.

The Met Police's criminal investigation into Savile's alleged child abuse centres around the shamed TV presenter.

The
probe, called Operation Yewtree was launched today by Scotland Yard. 
Detectives have now established that those who were involved in or knew 
about the alleged abuse include some 'living people that require formal 
investigation'.

Met Police 
have refused to name those being investigated but a spokesman told 
MailOnline they would include people who actively engaged in the alleged
abuse; people who facilitated or knew the alleged abuse was going on; 
and people involved in any conspiracy to cover up the alleged abuse.

The
investigation will look at the involvement of those who have since 
died. They cannot be prosecuted but their alleged offences can be 
investigated and used to bolster the investigation as a whole.

The woman believes Savile conspired with her attacker to plan the assault.

Yesterday the NSPCC said Savile is likely to be one of the most prolific sex offenders the charity has encountered.

Commander Peter Spindler, who is leading the inquiry for Scotland Yard, said his team is now pursuing more than 400 leads passed to police over the past fortnight.

He said: ‘What we have established in the last two weeks is that there are lines of inquiry involving living people. The public’s response to this issue has been astounding. We are dealing with alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale.’

A flood of calls to Scotland Yard and referrals from other forces has left senior officers shocked at the scale of Savile’s abuse. The entertainer died last year aged 84.

Police chiefs have pledged to record the complaints of his victims and publish the results  of their review as soon as  next month.

But yesterday they revealed for the first time that others in and around his celebrity circle face  investigation. It is understood that the vast majority of more than 200 potential victims accuse Savile of being their tormentor.

But there are a small number of alleged attacks where victims have pointed the finger at others. Among them is believed to be Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, accused of raping a girl of 13 in Savile’s BBC dressing room.

Separate and less serious allegations concern entertainer Freddie Starr. Starr, 69, yesterday again angrily denied claims he groped a 14-year-old girl after a Savile TV show.

Convicted paedophile Jonathan King is also likely to be questioned as well as other ex-colleagues at Radio 1 and BBC TV.

The fall-out from the Savile scandal continues to pile pressure on the BBC, three hospitals who hosted the star and some of his former colleagues.

Scotland Yard gave the broadcaster the green light to begin a formal review in parallel to its criminal inquiry yesterday.

Former High Court judge Dame Fiona Reynolds will examine whether the culture at the broadcaster enabled the abuse of children to ‘continue unchecked’.

Two other reviews will examine why Newsnight dropped an investigation into Savile and claims of sexual harassment.

A Department of Health investigation will also take place into Savile’s conduct at three hospitals – Stoke Mandeville, Broadmoor and Leeds General Infirmary.

The BBC and others could face a huge compensation bill if it is found they were negligent.

Peter Watt, of the NSPCC, said: ‘It’s now looking possible that Jimmy Savile was one of the most prolific sex offenders the NSPCC has ever come across.

‘We have received over 136 calls directly relating to allegations against him which we’ve passed to the police.’

A team of ten officers from the Met’s child abuse command are overseeing the inquiry, known as Operation Yewtree.

The investigation into alleged child sex abuse by Jimmy Savile has been become a criminal investigation after Scotland Yard identified more than 200 potential victims of the shamed presenter.

The Met had originally been conducting an 'assessment' into the claims against 
Savile, but now it appears that the Top Of The Pops presenter is 'one of the most prolific sex offenders' Britain has ever seen, according to the NSPCC.

But today Scotland Yard launched Operation Yewtree after detectives established that those who were involved in or knew about the alleged abuse include some 'living people that require formal investigation'.

Victim: Kevin Cook, (circled) Savile's youngest alleged victim, claims he was lured to a dressing room with the promise of receiving a Jim'll Fix It badge after appearing on the programme in 1976 when he was nine

Claims: Caroline Moore, left, claims she was a wheelchair-bound 13-year-old recovering from an operation to fuse her spine when Savile abused her during a visit to Stoke Mandeville hospital, while right Savile is snapped with another patient from the infirmary

Anyone with information or concerns should call NSPCC on 0808 800 5000.
