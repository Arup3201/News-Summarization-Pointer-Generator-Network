Four questions for Manchester United fans:

1) Does David Moyes know how to get the best out of Juan Mata?

My
 view: time will tell but the early signs are not convincing. Mata was 
desperate to play in a central role but when Wayne Rooney dropped deeper after
 Michael Carrick moved to centre back at Stoke, the whole system seemed 
confused. It made me wonder why Moyes didn’t bring Darren Fletcher on.

Moyes 
said United were the better team. Surely United fans don’t agree with 
that? Moyes will be scrutinised heavily as United manager – he better 
get used to it. And he can’t afford to say anything that might be 
interpreted as treating the club's supporters like idiots.

Back to the drawing board: David Moyes watched his side lose 2-1 at Stoke on Saturday

My
 view: in the press conference after the game, Moyes said how pleased he
 was that his players got to the bye-line and put balls in. When you play 
with wingers you risk having nine players every game, especially if you 
trust Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia to deliver. United should be 
better than that.

3) Will Tom Cleverley ever deliver?

My
 view: I honestly didn’t realise Cleverley was playing at Stoke until 
the end of the first half when I saw him standing over an injured Phil 
Jones.

He doesn’t dominate midfield, he doesn’t score, he doesn’t spray 
passes around, there is no killer ball, he is no tough tackler and there
 is no dynamism in his game.

When Carrick left his side to fill in at 
centre half he was exposed. He’s been given a fantastic opportunity to 
run Manchester United’s midfield. But he isn’t taking that opportunity.

4) Danny Welbeck – is anybody sure yet?

At
 times I’ve watched Welbeck play and felt confident he would go on to 
become an England regular. Then there was Saturday at Stoke when I 
thought it would be just plain wrong to take him to the World Cup. His 
impact on the game at Stoke was close to zero.

As an England fan I want 
him (and Cleverley) to do well. But given a great opportunity he simply 
doesn’t seem capable of leaving observers in no doubt that he really is 
the man to take United and England forward. Please prove the sceptics 
wrong Danny.

Jury's out: Neither Welbeck (left) nor Cleverley have convinced for Manchester United this season

Arsene Wenger and his scouting staff had 31 days of the transfer window to find a striker who’s better than Nicklas Bendtner. Astonishingly, they failed in that quest. It was Mission Impossible. Impossible to fail.

Maybe a world class striker wasn’t available. But they weren’t looking for the best in the world, they were looking for someone better than Bendtner.

I wonder if the Arsenal scouts went to watch January opponents Southampton in the FA Cup third round right at the start of the window.

No deal: Arsene Wenger opted not to sign a striker in the January transfer window

If they did they would have seen not one but two strikers who are both better than Bendtner.

Danny Ings and Sam Vokes both scored and played superbly at St Mary’s on January 4. You can look at the goals tally for both (Ings 22 all competitions, Vokes 15) but it’s the variety of the goals they score, the intelligent running, the link up play. And Burnley play very good football, they’re not long-ball merchants.

Are players from Burnley good enough for Arsenal? It would be pompous and ignorant to suggest they can’t be. Look at Jay Rodriguez if you disagree. Technically brilliant, and he can finish.

Ings and Vokes are better than Bendtner. So why didn’t Arsene Wenger go for either of them? £10million would be the maximum needed for either. Maybe it's because he hasn’t got a clue about anything outside of the top flight in England. I’m talking about spotting players in the lower leagues, not signing heralded youngsters like Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Carl Jenkinson.

I remember Arsenal winning a penalty shootout in the League Cup against Doncaster in 2005, and after the game Wenger said he thought some of the Rovers players would have a future in the Premier League. Not one of them went on to play in the English top flight.

Clearly Wenger’s encyclopaedic football knowledge doesn’t include the Football League. That’s a shame for Arsenal, because if you look closely, you’ll see there are strikers down there who are clearly better than Bendtner.

Out of Nick: Bendtner is Wenger's only real alternative to first-choice Olivier Giroud

I was at Stoke on Saturday to watch them beat Manchester United 2-1, and it’s good to see Charlie Adam rediscover his form since I questioned what he brings to the Premier League a few weeks ago. His winning goal was a joy to commentate on and take nothing away from Stoke, they deserved to win the game in my opinion.

But referee Neil Swarbrick was guilty of blatant inconsistency during the game. At one end Stoke’s Marc Wilson had his arms around Robin van Persie’s neck in the box – nothing given. Minutes later Chris Smalling has his arms around Jon Walters’ waist, Swarbrick gives a free-kick and Stoke score the opening goal.

The ref had a clear view of both and he simply cannot give one decision and not give the other.

Penalised: Chris Smalling gave away the free-kick that led to Stoke's opening goal

Why doesn’t anyone talk about Jack Colback for England? Is it because he’s ginger? How many gingers have worn the Three Lions with any success? Alan Ball in 1966 of course. But since then Ray Parlour scandalously won only 10 England caps, Paul Scholes quit England because he was being wasted on the left, and that’s about it.

I’m not saying Colback should be picked because he’s ginger.

But he certainly shouldn’t be overlooked because of the colour of his hair.

Is he good enough? He’s better than Tom Cleverley that’s for sure.

Fine form: Jack Colback has been outstanding for Sunderland since Gus Poyet took charge

Edwin van der Sar holds a world record – when he was at Manchester United he went 1,311 minutes without conceding a goal in the Premier League. That record is under threat. Celtic’s Fraser Forster is currently on 1,035 minutes in the Scottish Premiership.

But don’t you think it would be an absolute scandal if Forster took that record off the Dutchman? Celtic are a heavyweight champ bossing the ring, seeing off a succession of flyweights week in, week out. Every game is a mis-match for Celtic, it will be an embarrassment if Forster doesn’t break the record.

It’s no criticism of the England man – he’s just doing his job. But it would be so wrong for a keeper at such a dominant club in such an uncompetitive league to take such glory.

Dutch master: Edwin van der Sar broke all manner of records as Manchester United goalkeeper

On Sunday, Forster broke Celtic’s clean 
sheet record when he shut out St Mirren, making it 11 in a row. Charlie Shaw – a 5ft 6in keeper, Celtic captain and legend - set the original 
record in 1922. Neil Lennon described Forster’s achievement as 'a 
testament to him and the players in front of him.'

Really?

As Lennon also said, Forster wasn’t 
'overly worked' during the 1-0 win over St Mirren. He’s not been overly 
worked all season in the Scottish Premiership.

Celtic’s wage bill is more than six times
 bigger than the next highest in the top flight north of the border. 
Rangers are out of the picture, and there is no serious challenge.

So any records broken by Celtic at this 
time when the Scottish Premiership is so moribund should be wiped from 
history. Not only are they totally meaningless, they’re an insult to 
those who worked so much harder to break the record previously.

We should all tip our hats to Jose Mourinho, he studied Manchester City and he worked out a way to beat them. Chelsea were brilliant, and they didn’t need to park the bus. They could have scored five.

There were plenty of 10 out of 10 performances among the Chelsea players in their 1-0 victory. John Terry and Gary Cahill were imperious; Nemanja Matic showed Yaya Toure how it’s done; Willian was non-stop; Branislav Ivanovic was the match-winner. But only one man was 11 out of 10 and that was Eden Hazard. He was simply stunning – strength with technique and end product, and I would happily pay good money to watch the Belgian.

His role in the winning goal was fantastic. He’s the kind of player you want to take your children to see just so they can say they saw him at his best.

If people simply total up goals then Luis Suarez or Sergio Aguero or maybe Aaron Ramsey will win Player of the Year. But for me Eden Hazard has been the best player in the Premier League so far this season. He’s got everything.

Stunning performance: Chelsea's Eden Hazard embarks on another mesmeric run

How can a man facing charges of attempted embezzlement in Italy (which he denies), with an arrest warrant issued for him stating he has 'marked criminal tendencies…capable of using every kind of deception to achieve his ends', get anywhere near the front door at Elland Road?

The Football League issued a statement on February 1 saying it was having 'conversations' with Eleonora Sports Ltd, the group led by Massimo Cellino. By that time the Italian had sacked Brian McDermott through his solicitor, signed a player (Andrea Tabanelli), and attempted to put the man he wanted to take over as manager (Gianluca Festa) in the dugout for the game against Ipswich, he was already making decisions at Leeds United.

It's absolutely pathetic from the Football League, which needs to take a long, hard look at itself. After what’s happened at Leeds in the past few days, you have to question whether the League is carrying out its duty of care to clubs.

Brian McDermott deserves so much better, and so do the Leeds United fans.

Back in the hotseat: Brian McDermott was sacked then reinstated in a bizarre few days
