An ISIS-inspired teen in Tokyo has been caught 'practicing murder' with a junior school's pet goat, according to the Tokyo metropolitan police. 

The 14-year old boy, who can not be named for legal reasons, said he wanted behead the kid goat before he attacked a human victim after viewing videos of the recent killings of Japanese hostages by ISIS.

Police in Tachikawa, a middle-class bed-town serving central Tokyo, said that the boy had been found attacking the goat with a crowbar at 1am in the morning on March 16.

Victim: Inspired by watching horrendous videos of ISIS executions, a teenager in Tokyo tried to behead a goat (pictured) as 'practice' before attacking a human

Lucky escape: The boy was found attacking the goat with a crowbar at 1am in Tachikawa, a middle-class town serving central Tokyo

Chilling inspiration: Police quoted the boy who tried to behead the goat (pictured) as saying: 'I wanted to murder somebody, anybody, after viewing videos of the Islamic State'

Safe: The goat escaped any serious injuries and the boy - who is a minor - does not qualify for Japan's capital punishment laws despite calls on Twitter to give him the death penalty

Police said they were alerted to the assault when a passing police officer heard the repeated bleatings of the goat. 

The teen was caught chasing it and was found to be carrying a saw and other workman's tools.

'I wanted to murder somebody, anybody, after viewing videos of the Islamic State. But first I decided to kill the school goat for practice,' the police quoted the boy as saying.

The attempt on the animal has parallels with another ISIS inspired attack in suburban Kawasaki, adjacent to Tokyo, earlier last month. 

Like the chief suspect in the Kawasaki murder, the goats' assailant was also a dropout, according to the police, and a 'hikikomori' a shut-in - common among the young in Japan. 

One of the three high school boys charged with stabbing a 12-year-old boy to death in Kawasaki proclaimed himself and the rest of his 'team' as the 'Kawasaki State' - following the same naming pattern as the terrorist organization ISIS. 

The gang terrorised other students in the port city declaring: 'We're above the law. We run by our own rules. We are Kawasaki State. If you go against us, we'll cut off your head while you're still alive!' 

Punishment: Police said the goat's assailant will be charged with trespassing and is now in the hands of Tokyo's juvenile court

Anger: In light of the attack on the goat, some have blamed Japanese parents for not knowing how to control their children's internet usage

The three are due to be tried for murder in a juvenile court later this year. Both the Kawaski murder and the attempt on the goat have generated thousands of tweets in Japan calling for the death penalty for minors in the case of heinous crimes. 

The perpetrators in both cases are all minors - under 20-years-old in Japan - and are not subject to the country's capital punishment laws.

'Murder must be punished by the death penalty whatever the age,' was one reaction.

Other blamed Japanese parents who do not know how to control their children's internet usage because they are allegedly technologically illiterate.

Violent viewing: The computer of the boy who attacked the goat contained videos of hostage beheadings - including those of Japanese hostages Kenji Goto (left) and Haruna Yukawa (right)

Police in the Tachikawa case confirmed that the boy's computer showed a long history of downloaded videos of Islamic State beheading hostages - and that the suspect had viewed them repeatedly. 

The most viewed were the beheadings of two Japanese hostages in January - journalist Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa, a security contractor.

Police said the goat's assailant will be charged with trespassing and is now in the hands of Tokyo's juvenile court. They added that the goat escaped any serious injuries.
