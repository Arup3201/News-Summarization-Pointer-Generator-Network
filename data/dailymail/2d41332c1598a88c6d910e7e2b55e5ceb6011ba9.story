A planned three-day strike by London Underground workers in a row over Tube ticket office closures was today dramatically called off after last-ditch talks.

Rail, Maritime and Transport union members were due to walk out from 9pm, but a breakthrough was made at a meeting with LU. The union said the industrial action had been suspended.

London Mayor Boris Johnson described it as a ‘victory for common sense and for Londoners’.

But RMT acting general secretary Mick Cash said: ‘Due to the solidarity and determination of our LU members, and their delivery of rock-solid industrial action last week, we have been able to secure real movement and significant progress on the issues at the heart of this dispute in talks with the Tube management over the bank holiday weekend.

‘Pre-conditions
 have been removed, protection of earnings has been agreed and we now 
have a viable framework for a proper review of the cuts and closures 
programme.

‘As a result of 
that progress, secured directly through our members campaign of 
industrial action and the union's drive to get the facts across to the 
people of London, we are able to suspend the action due to commence this
 evening and further talks around the fundamental issues of cuts to 
jobs, services and safety will now take place.’

Phil Hufton, chief operating officer of 
London Underground, said: ‘I am pleased that Londoners will not have to 
endure further strike action this week.

‘The only way to resolve this
 dispute is for the RMT leadership to work with us to shape the future 
of the Tube in a changing world. It is good that they have committed to 
doing so alongside the three other unions involved.

‘As we have always said, we are, of course, open to discuss any proposals our staff or the unions may offer.

‘Modernisation
 of the Tube means that it is our intention to close all ticket offices,
 used in less than 3 per cent of journeys, and instead deliver a vastly 
better customer service by bringing more staff than ever before out on 
to the concourses of stations at ticket machines, ticket gates and 
platforms - just as we delivered during the London 2012 Games.

‘This 
will also allow us to save £50million per annum to reinvest in better 
and more reliable train services and to keep fares down.’

The development followed talks at the 
conciliation service. An Acas spokeman said: 'We are pleased that we 
have been able to assist 
the parties to reach an understanding that allows the industrial action 
this week to be withdrawn.'

Mr Johnson said: ‘This is a victory for common sense and for Londoners. The RMT leadership has finally seen that their tactics aren't working.

‘I always said these strikes were pointless, and by getting so many people to work during last week's stoppage Transport for London has shown the RMT that its actions, supported by a minority of its members, will achieve nothing.

‘It is vital that we continue to reform the Tube for the benefit of our passengers. I'm delighted that hard-working Londoners and businesses across the capital will now be free to go about their work without the threat of needless industrial action.

‘It is essential we get on with our modernisation programme and that includes the closure of 260 ticket offices, saving £50million a year that will be reinvested into the network.

‘This will get more staff out from behind glass screens and back offices to help passengers, and all without any need for compulsory redundancies.

‘There is no justification at all for holding London to ransom. Tomorrow the Government will announce their support for my proposals on ballot thresholds which will limit the power of unions to disrupt the capital in the future, on a whim and without majority support.

‘That Government backing is very welcome, as is this morning's decision to call off the strike.’
