Sarah Andrews was resigned to feeling ill forever. 

For four years she lived with debilitating bouts of dizziness, distorted vision and chronic tiredness, with doctors at a loss to explain what was wrong.

Sarah had also become sensitive to light and noise. 

‘Gradually my symptoms became more and more frequent until they occurred daily and meant I couldn’t work for ten months,’ says Sarah, 42, a customer service adviser who lives in Liverpool with her partner Ian, 49, who works in retail.

She had been back and forth to doctors dozens of times and wrongly told she had everything from the ear complaint labyrinthitis to chronic fatigue syndrome to vertigo. 

For four years Sarah Andrews, 42, lived with debilitating bouts of dizziness, distorted vision and chronic tiredness. Her symptoms were actually migraines, brought on by the early stages of the menopause

The correct diagnosis, when it finally came, was a surprise. Her symptoms were actually migraines, brought on by the early stages of the menopause.

‘I hadn’t had any other menopausal symptoms, such as night sweats or hot flushes,’ says Sarah. 

‘And I had no idea migraines could be a sign of the menopause or that migraines could occur without a headache.’

Many women, like Sarah, are unaware that the onset of migraines, or experiencing more frequent or severe migraines, can be a sign the menopause is approaching — but experts say it’s surprisingly common.

The problem is that these women may not necessarily develop headaches — the symptoms vary widely and can include visual disturbances such as seeing flashing lights and zig-zag lines, fatigue, neck pain, mood change, poor memory, restless legs, dizziness and sensitivity to light and noise.

Usually these occur in the days preceding the headache — known as the premonitory phase of the migraine — but in some people the headache never strikes.

‘I regularly see female patients in their 40s whose migraine became chronic, meaning they occur on more than 15 days each month in the lead up to the menopause,’ says Dr Nick Silver, a consultant neurologist from the Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust in Liverpool, who treated Sarah. 

‘Often they haven’t realised they are perimenopausal. Some have never had migraine before.’

The perimenopause — when women start to experience menopausal symptoms — lasts, on average, for four years before a woman stops having periods and the menopause starts. 

Research recently presented to the American Headache Society found women get as many as 60 per cent more migraines in the years before and at the start of the menopause, and that along with hot flushes and depression, migraine can be a symptom of the menopause.

There is a strong hormonal link to migraines — which may explain why women are more likely to get them than men.  

The perimenopause — when women start to experience menopausal symptoms — lasts, on average, for four years before a woman stops having periods and the menopause starts

And, says Dr Silver, it’s not just when a woman is menopausal — migraines often occur at stages of hormonal change, but because they can bring a variety of symptoms they can be easily overlooked or misdiagnosed.

‘Oestrogen drops in the middle of the menstrual cycle and just before each period starts, which are the most common times for migraine to occur in women,’ says Dr Silver.

‘When a girl’s periods first start, they may experience a headache and/or a form known as abdominal migraine — causing predominant tummy pain.  

'Because they can occur without headache, this can sometimes be dismissed as period pains.’

Many women find their migraines improve during pregnancy when the hormones remain relatively constant. 

After pregnancy, however, they often return, but the symptoms, which can include fatigue and depression, may be mistaken for post-natal depression especially as these symptoms can seem more prominent than a headache.

‘Women may be given anti-depressants unnecessarily, but because they can improve migraine in some people, they think a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis was correct, though other treatments may be more appropriate,’ says Dr Silver.

But it’s not just these women who get misdiagnosed. Dr Silver says: ‘Up to 80 per cent of migraine and headache disorders may be given the wrong diagnosis,’ and often people mistakenly get told they have psychological problems or even stress instead.

Migraine is a disorder of brain nerve cells and receptors. When they function inappropriately they can cause increased sensitivity to light and sound.

When it comes to treating hormone-related migraines, there’s some disagreement among specialists.

‘When evidence clearly shows women are having migraine related to hormones, for example during the perimenopause or at the start of every period, an oestrogen gel which stabilises oestrogen levels can be prescribed by GPs,’ says Professor John Studd, a former consultant gynaecologist at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, West London.

‘This virtually always stops migraines for good. But not enough people are treated with it as they should be, because neurologists and GPs often try preventative anti-migraine drugs instead. 

'They aren’t aware of the oestrogen treatment or don’t always realise the migraines are linked to hormones.

‘Women put up with a lot of suffering without treatment.’

Migraine is a disorder of brain nerve cells and receptors

However, Dr Silver disagrees and believes hormone treatment should typically be a last resort, saying it can occasionally be risky and have side-effects. Instead, he says these patients should be treated the same as others with migraine.

Changing lifestyle factors can dramatically improve migraine in 40 per cent of patients, he says — this includes drinking more water, eating meals regularly, sleeping and waking at the same time each day, avoiding caffeine (in coffee, tea, green tea, cola and chocolate) and regular use of painkillers.

If this doesn’t help, the next options are drugs such as candesartan, propranalol or topiramate that are also used to treat epilepsy and high blood pressure or anti-depressants which work on chemical messengers in the brain.

Botox injections are also used and are thought to reduce pain signals from various receptors to the brain. 

‘When none of these measures work we can look at hormonal treatments, usually a low-dose HRT patch,’ says Dr Silver.

HRT works like oestrogen gel, to balance out levels of oestrogen in the body. Some may also contain a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone.

However, in women under 50 who experience problems with aura — usually visual disturbances such as flashing lights or zigzag lines — this treatment doubles their risk of stroke, although the overall risk is still very low. 

Most women with hormone-related migraines will find they stop or become less frequent after the menopause.

Sarah finally discovered what was causing her crippling symptoms when a physiotherapist helping with her balance issues told her she had migraine-associated vertigo, not headaches, and referred her to Dr Silver.

By then, her migraines had taken over her life.

‘Ian and I used to travel and socialise a lot but by then we couldn’t even watch telly together because the screen would set me off, and I couldn’t stand any noise without it causing pain,’ says Sarah. 

Migraine is a disorder of brain nerve cells and receptors. 

When they function inappropriately they can cause increased sensitivity to light and sound.  

Migraine is among the three most prevalent health conditions worldwide, along with anaemia and hearing loss.

Severe migraine attacks are classified by the World Health Organisation as among the most disabling illnesses, comparable to dementia, quadriplegia and active psychosis.

It is the least publicly funded of all neurological illnesses relative to its economic impact.

In the UK there are an estimated 190,000 migraine attacks every day.

‘Sometimes my fatigue was so bad I’d sleep for 14 hours and then by the time I got down the stairs I’d feel exhausted again.’

When Dr Silver looked back through her medical history, he could see she had been having hormone-related migraines earlier in her life. 

'Sarah hadn’t realised what it was, but as a teenager she had felt ill on the first day of each period for a couple of years.

‘I would get awful stomach ache which I thought were just period pains.’ she says.

‘I’d never thought they were migraines as I didn’t have headaches, but looking back I realise they were — as well as abdominal pain, sometimes I saw flashing lights, my hearing would go, and I’d feel sick and faint.’

When Dr Silver explained the link between her latest symptoms and the menopause, it immediately made sense.

‘Shortly after the dizziness and visual symptoms started, my periods became lighter and less regular — signs of the perimenopause,’ explains Sarah, whose mother and grandmother both had an early menopause at 40.

As she was under 50 and experienced migraine aura she was not given HRT, but tried a number of treatments that didn’t work. 

However, since last August she has found taking candesartan blood pressure pills, prescribed by Dr Silver, combined with Botox, acupuncture and reflexology has reduced the severity of her migraines, so she can now work from home and socialise again.

‘My life still isn’t back to normal,’ says Sarah. ‘I never knew the menopause could trigger anything like this, or that migraines could be so debilitating.’
