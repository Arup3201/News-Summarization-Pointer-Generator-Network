Spectacular images of giant sea turtles on the Great Barrier Reef illustrate perfectly why the majestic animals are known as the ancient mariners of the sea.

Captured swimming through the water in all their glory, the turtles are not phased by nearby snorkelers and divers, including German photographer Christian Miller, who took the breathtaking photos.

Using their fins to effortless carve through the water, one turtle is pictured pushing a diver out the way - possibly more intent on finding a good feeding area.

But hoping for some interaction, the diver attempts to give the turtle a kiss, which goes ignored.

The turtles have become used to the presence of humans underwater on the reef and can swim within touching distance of divers

Mr Miller, 36, now lives in Cairns in said his underwater photo shoots of the animals had seen him develop a close affection towards the turtles.

'When you're working this near to animals, you start to become close to them. Sometimes I have to put the camera aside just to enjoy their beauty through my own eyes,' he said.

'On most dive sites here in local reefs the sea turtles are used to human interaction and are quite friendly. They are most likely happily feeding on some algae or sea grass.'

Mr Miller's dives with the turtles take about an hour and offer him a truly unique viewpoint as he watches the animals become inquisitive of divers and swim within touching distance.

Prehistoric: Turtles have been on earth for about 150 million years and date back to the dinosaurs, helping them earn the moniker ancient mariners of the sea

The animals have lived in the sea for 150 million years, dating back to the dinosaurs and leading to them being called ancient mariners of the sea.

Six sea turtle species including the green sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, flatback turtle, the olive ridley and the leatherback sea turtle all breed on the Great Barrier Reef.

Mr Miller said there are two things in his life he will never stop doing.

'One is to create art; the other is my passion for animals and nature. Photography merges the two, and so it doesn't get any better for me,' he said.
