Strewn with litter, smothered in mould, this is the squalid home where a charity worker kept three dogs and four cats for up to 10 years.

Dorothy Harland, 58, was a founding member of the Emergency Animal Rescue Service (EARS) in Ripon, North Yorkshire.

But as she spent her days urging people to take in neglected animals, her own were left suffering in a decrepit house.

Horrendous: Three dogs and four cats lived for up to ten years in this home in Harrogate, North Yorkshire

The conditions were so horrendous that officers who eventually discovered the hovel could not stay inside for more than a minute without gas masks.

Harland, who pleaded guilty to five counts of animal neglect at Harrogate Magistrate's Court, has been barred from keeping animals for ten years and ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work.

The court heard the animals tried to burst out of the house when they were eventually discovered on December 14 last year.

As police opened the door to the property in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, Charlie, a German-Shepherd cross, leaped out and started running around in circles.

Bruno,
 a 16-year-old cross-breed, also tried to escape but was too weak to walk
 and kept falling over.

Medical tests revealed he had suffered a stroke 
days before police found them, and vets were forced to put him down.

'Cruel': Jack, a Saluki, was discovered in a rusty cage too small to stand in, with no food or water in sight

When
 RSPCA inspectors arrived later, they discovered a third dog, a Saluki named 
Jack who was kept in a rusty cage too small to stand in. There was no food or water in sight.

Four cats - Murphy, Molly, Polly and Dolly - were also found amongst the rubbish and broken furniture.

RSPCA workers said it was the worst house they had inspecting in 20 years.

'It was disgusting, it really was,' said RSPCA inspector Dave Holgate.

'Someone who works with an animal charity should really know better. 
Somebody working with animals knows what is right and what is wrong, and
 that is wrong.'

The court heard police were alerted to the animals' suffering by a Yorkshire Water contractor investigating a leak at the house.

The officers immediately contacted the RSPCA for emergency support.

PC Raheel Akram told the RSPCA in a memo: 'It was astonishing the level of dirt and I had never seen a premises in such an appalling state.'

Prosecuting on Wednesday, Andrew Davidson said: 'The conditions had built up over a significant period of time.

'She allowed her attachment to her animals as pets to come before their need to have proper living conditions.'

The court heard that Harland, who pleaded guilty to five counts of animal neglect, was suffering from depression and had been living in the appalling conditions alongside her animals.

Defending Nick Woodhouse said: 'She doesn't have close family or friends so no-one visited the house.

'Her animals seem to have been a crutch for her, she says animals are her reason for getting up in the morning.'

Magistrates
 were told that any disqualification order would prevent Harland from 
continuing her work with EARS, a charity which has rescued over 130 
dogs.

Saved: Jack was taken in by RSPCA inspectors and rehomed, along with German Shepherd cross Charlie and four cats. Another dog, Bruno, had to be put down after tests revealed he had had a stroke

Her friend and colleague at the charity, Margaret Wells told the court: 'She does a great job and I don't think we could do it without her.'

Chief Magistrate Michael Poole told Harland: 'From your charity work you were aware that your care was seriously lacking. The RSPCA say it is one of the worst they have seen in years and they were appalled by the state of yours and the animals living accommodation.'

He added that Harland cannot apply to the court for the ten-year ban to be removed for at least five years.

Placed under a 12 month supervision order, she was also ordered to pay £200 of the £4,000 the RSPCA have spent on bringing the case the court, along with a £60 surcharge.

Jack, Charlie and all four cats have since been rehomed.
