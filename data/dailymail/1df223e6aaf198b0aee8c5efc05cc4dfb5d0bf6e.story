Joe Burns looks set to make his Test debut for Australia after Mitchell Marsh pulled out of the squad for the third Test against India due to a hamstring injury.

The Queensland batsman is part of a 13-man squad for the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after impressing Australia coach Darren Lehmann, whom he played under at state level.

The 25-year-old averages 42.54 in this season's Sheffield Shield and has beaten experienced duo Ed Cowan and Adam Voges to a place.

'You're always trying to look ahead when you can, but you're still living in the moment,' Lehmann told the Cricket Australia website.

'We think he's the best man. He can fit anywhere from one to six (in the batting order). He gives us a little bit more flexibility compared to the other two ... and it's a chance to play a guy who is young.'

Burns was obviously delighted to be included.

'It took a fair while to sink in,' he said. 'I'm over the moon at the news as it is the best Christmas present I could ever hope for. I'm just so happy.'

Burns hit 183 against New South Wales in November, impressing the powers that be.

'Trevor Hohns and Mark Waugh saw that and were very impressed,' Lehmann said. 'We think he's got something about him ... hopefully he offers runs, first and foremost.

'He's a very aggressive player, which is always good to see. That's the way we like to play.'

Lehmann also hopes batsman David Warner is fit to play after the opener was struck on the thumb in Australia's run chase at the Gabba, when they made the 130 runs needed with just four wickets in hand.
