Butterfly sightings quadrupled in  the summer heatwave compared to last year’s washout, a survey found.

A record 46,000 volunteers spent 15 minutes a day noting 830,000 sightings in the Big Butterfly Count over three weeks in July and August.

Most popular species were the small white and large white – both rising by 300 per cent – followed by peacocks, up by 3,500 per cent on last year.

Most popular: Sightings of small and Large White butterflies (pictured) rose by 300% on last year's figures

Garden favourite the small tortoiseshell – in a worrying decline – was the sixth most-spotted species with a  rise of 388 per cent. Twelve species’ numbers rose by more than 50 per cent.

Butterfly Conservation spokesman Richard Fox said: ‘We had a really good summer, which is positive for all parts of the butterfly life cycle.

'They’re cold-blooded creatures and their ability to be active in any sense, developing in an egg, feeding and growing as a caterpillar, developing as pupae or flying about as butterflies are all dependent on temperature.'

He said the warmer weather meant they could go through their life-cycle faster and as adults were able to go about the process of successfully breeding.

Second most common: Sightings of Peacock butterflies rose a remarkable 3,500 per cent on last year

This year’s good results showed that butterflies were resilient and could thrive given good weather and suitable habitats, he said.

Several species saw numbers fall back after doing well last year, including ringlet and marbled white, meadow brown and six-spot burnet moths.

Mr Fox said the four species all have a single generation each year, and so low numbers this year are likely to be the result of last year’s poor breeding season.

The poll was promoted by actress Joanna Lumley for Marks & Spencer.

She said: 'Butterflies are magical creatures that are crucial to our environment and this year’s count success shows that by giving up just 15 minutes of our time we can all play our part to help secure their future.'
