It was the quick-fire game show that never gave you a second chance to get it right.

But now Fifteen to One is making a comeback some of its old contestants have finally been given another shot at victory.

The classic teatime quiz will return to Channel 4 tomorrow afternoon after a break of 11 years.

Fifteen to one is set to make a comeback. The show, which originally ran from 1988 to 2003, was seen as one of the most difficult on TV and gathered a loyal following among students and pensioners

While its former host William G. Stewart, 78, has been replaced with Sandi Toksvig, 55, fans of the original show will recognise the same knockout format and fiendish questions.

The show, which originally ran from 1988 to 2003, was seen as one of the most difficult on TV and gathered a loyal following among students and pensioners.

The most eagle eyed among them may spot a few familiar faces on the new series.

Among the new line up of hopefuls are two contestants who were knocked out first time round and are hoping to redeem themselves.

Margaret Burton, 68, first appeared in 2000 and made the final three before crashing out.

Since then her husband Jon, who watched her performance from the green room, has died. After six years as a widow she found love on an internet dating site and remarried.

The retired pub landlady from Lancing, West Sussex said she remembered Mr Stewart as being ‘a little forbidding’.

She added: ‘It had always been my idea of a proper quiz show with lots of questions and no gimmicks. I liked the idea of being able to have another go.’

Also hoping for a second shot at the top prize is solicitor David Stainer, 35, from Hertford.

When he first competed on Fifteen to One, he was a 20-year-old student at Oriel College, Oxford, making his first TV quiz appearance.

Since then, he has married and had a son, and become a game show veteran. He has appeared on University Challenge, Only Connect and won £64,000 on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? in 2001.

He said: ‘I will never forget the question that knocked me out of Fifteen to One. It was “What is the common name of myastotis, the romantic woodland plant?”

‘I now know the answer is Forget-me-not, but my general knowledge is much better now.’

He added: ‘Fifteen To One was always my favourite game show. It is a show for purists because it is so difficult and they don’t waste time.

The no-frills set of the new series is similar to the original, and it has the same format in which 15 contestants answer questions on each episode until there is a winner

‘If anything, it has got harder now because there are more popular culture questions. People may think they are easy, but they require a much broader general knowledge.’

Mr Stewart, who has retired, once claimed he asked 350,000 questions in his 35 series run on Fifteen to One.

The no-frills set of the new series is similar to the original, and it has the same format in which 15 contestants answer questions on each episode until there is a winner.

The top fifteen scorers of the series will compete in a grand final for a £40,000 top prize.

Fifteen to One will start tomorrow at 5.30pm and continue on weekdays at 4.30pm.
