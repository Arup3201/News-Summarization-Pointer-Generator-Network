Brazilian midfielder Kaka is set to become a high-profile signing for new Major League Soccer franchise Orlando City, according to reports.

The 32-year-old will be loaned to Sao Paulo, the club where his career began, before taking on the MLS in 2015.

The AC Milan midfielder will become the second big name to cross the Atlantic this summer after Spanish striker David Villa signed for New York City.

Kaka is currently in his second spell with AC Milan having spent four years at Real Madrid in between.

The Brazilian, who scored 29 goals in 87 caps for his country, holds a Champions League winner's medal as well as Serie A and La Liga titles.

Kaka told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera in March: 'One day, I would like to play in America. At the end of the season, I will talk to [general manager Adriano Galliani]. Not just to speak about bonuses and money -- money is not the main thing for me now, and I think that is understood.

'I want to see what his ideas are and what the clubâ€™s ideas are. If it turns out I need to move, I will choose the MLS.'
