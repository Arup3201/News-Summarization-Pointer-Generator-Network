No huge banners, no pre-match announcement and no chants. Malky Mackay is back in management — but the hearts and minds operation might take some time.

When there was a half-hearted call for a wave from fans early in the first half, the fallen star of the Cardiff pantomime was too busy directing Marc-Antoine Fortune to respond.

A year is a long time to be out of management, yet no time at all in the context of the damage he has done to his reputation. He is back now, though, and the challenge will be to ensure Wigan owner Dave Whelan has not hurt his own name for no tangible reward.

The best way to do that will be through results. It might be disheartening but it is true and, in that regard, a draw against the Championship’s third-placed team will work wonders.

It would have been more had Mackay’s new side held on to the lead gained through Shaun Maloney’s 25th-minute free-kick. But Patrick Bamford, on loan from Chelsea, levelled in the second half and ensured there were only half smiles for Mackay and Whelan. Against the backdrop of a rotten week, that should be enough.

The toll was clear on Whelan’s face as he made his way to his seat ahead of kick-off. Like the League Managers’ Association in the summer, Wigan’s chairman attempted to defend Mackay’s conduct and only succeeded in shooting himself in the foot. He has until early next week to explain his Jewish and Chinese remarks to the FA, amid calls for him to step down. For his part, he has already claimed any suggestion from the authorities that he is racist will lead to his resignation.

Speaking before this fixture, he said: ‘Should they even suggest I’m guilty I would immediately resign from my position as chairman of Wigan Athletic.

‘I hope they don’t and I don’t see anything like that happening because I’m absolutely anti-racist, always have been, always will be. However, if they have any questions I’m willing to answer it.’

It is a dramatic threat and one that would not be popular in these parts.

He was afforded an ovation before the game and 30 seconds into the game there was a chant of ‘One Dave Whelan, only one Dave Whelan’.

Boro’s contingent responded by singing: ‘You’re a town full of racists.’ And: ‘He texts what he wants, Malky Mackay, he texts what he wants.’ Pure pantomime.

Meanwhile, the manager at the heart of this storm was a blur of hand movements and skips in the technical area. His enthusiasm was obvious and, for a time, it seemed like his fortune might turn.

Maloney sounded an alarm with a delightful free-kick in the 10th minute which dipped on to the top of the bar. It was from an identical position on the edge of the area that he scored.

From there it was largely a game controlled by Wigan. In their previous 12 games, they had won only once; in the same stretch Boro had lost only once.

Boro almost levelled shortly before the break. In a move of brilliance, Albert Adomah and Lee Tomlin produced a one-touch sequence to put Kike through on goal, but the striker curled the ball wide of the far post.

Bamford came on 10 minutes into the second half and within three minutes had equalised. Mackay buried his head in his hands, but said later: ‘I didn’t know what the crowd would be like but everyone was so welcoming.

‘I am very proud that on the day my father and son were here and the hairs were up on the back of my neck. I’ve been long time in the Championship and I’ve no doubts as to to the size of the task.’
