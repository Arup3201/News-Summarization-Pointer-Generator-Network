A blast of severe weather has struck a large portion of the Midwest, bringing harsh winds, freezing temperatures and even tornadoes to the region.

A tornado reportedly touched 
down in north central Arkansas, injuring at least four people, damaged 
at least 33 homes and decimated a church.

The twister touched down near Botkinburg in 
north-central Arkansas, said John Robinson, the warning coordination 
meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in North Little 
Rock.

KTHV-TV reported that the Botkinburg Foursquare Church, which was only about a decade old, was leveled when the storm tore through the area. A home was also destroyed and an 18-wheeler was seen on its side.

At least four people have been injured.

ArkansasOnline.com reported that the majority of the damage was done in Van Buren County.

In Missouri, about 15 homes were damaged by high winds believed to be from tornado activity in the suburbs west and northwest of St Louis, the bulk of them in the community of Hazelwood, said Bill Roach, a spokesman for the St Louis County office of emergency management.

Devastation: An unspecified number of tornado touchdowns were confirmed in the St Louis area but gave no estimates of damage

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and issued a bulletin saying that 'a system of strong storms and tornadoes caused damage in the St. Louis region and other areas of the state.'

It said an unspecified number of tornado touchdowns were confirmed in the St Louis area but gave no estimates of damage.

Butch
Dye, a hydrometeorological technician with the National Weather Service
in St Louis, Missouri, said severe weather struck the suburb of 
Hazelwood.

'We won't be able to confirm whether it was a tornado until teams get out there tomorrow,' Dye said.

At
the same time, storms packing snow, ice and dangerous winds have 
knocked out power in communities throughout the Midwest and prompted 
Minnesota's governor to call out the state National Guard to help 
residents.

Stormy weather: Thousands of customers in Minnesota were left without power when the winter storm struck the area

Icy weather left
thousands of people in Minnesota in the dark yesterday, while another 
storm threatens to dump several inches of wet snow in the state later 
today.

Minnesota Gov 
Mark Dayton said the weather was taxing the resources of local and 
county governments, and he issued an executive order activating the 
guard.

The town of Worthington was using backup diesel generators to power sections of the city at a time, public utilities manager Scott Hain told Minnesota Public Radio.

Roughly a quarter to a third of the city of about 13,000 people was without power at any given time, he said.

'With the generation that we have available, we are conducting rolling blackouts through the community,' Hain said.

'From
what we're hearing from the folks that own the transmission that's down
right now, is we expect that we'll be operating under this same 
scenario at least through the rest of today and possibly into tomorrow 
as well.'

The National Weather Service said southwestern Minnesota could get 8 or 9 inches of snow by Thursday morning, while 8 to 14 inches was forecast for a large swath of southern Minnesota, including the Twin Cities, St Cloud, Willmar and Mankato starting on Wednesday night and into Thursday.

In Nebraska, where strong winds 
caused a train derailment in the eastern part of the state earlier in 
the day, also was expecting more snow.

At
the University of Nebraska Kearney, approximately 5,500 of books were 
seen propped open to dry after parts of their library's entire roof tore
off from high winds, causing the books to get wet.

Interestingly the books were sent to a
local refrigeration company to be frozen for the next few months, a 
process recommended by experts in helping them safely dry, according to 
University spokesperson Kelly Bartling.

'We're hopeful that we can let 
students in starting tomorrow to at least some portions of the 
building,' Ms Bartling told MailOnline.

Residents in eastern South Dakota 
were hunkering down Wednesday for the second wave of a spring storm that
already downed power lines and closed roads, schools and businesses.

Tens of thousands of residents in that part of the state remained without power as they awaited more bad weather.

Freezing drizzle was expected to give
way Wednesday night to 6 to 12 inches of snow accompanied by winds of 
15 to 25 miles per hour, said Philip Schumacher, a National Weather 
Service meteorologist.

The 
weather service said the challenging weather could extend into 
flood-prone southeastern North Dakota, where about 3 to 5 inches of snow
is expected through late Thursday.

Although it could contain at least one-quarter inch of liquid, weather service officials said it should not change the current flood forecast.

'Any additional precipitation at this
stage in the game is not necessarily a good thing,' said Peter Rogers, a
weather service meteorologist in Grand Forks. 'But we're not expecting 
that to have an immediate impact on the rivers either.'

In
Wisconsin, rain, ice and snow caused minor flooding Wednesday in areas 
including the Rock River at Afton and Newville, Crawfish River at 
Milford, Sheboygan River at Sheboygan, and Manitowoc River at Manitowoc.

Wisconsin
Emergency Management spokesman Tod Pritchard said another wave of 
freezing rain could sweep across central Wisconsin from La Crosse to 
Green Bay from late Wednesday into Thursday.

That rain could cause more flooding in the region.
