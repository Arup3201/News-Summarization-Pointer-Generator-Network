When Eleanor Scotchbrook turned 30 she lost weight and find out that nothing in her wardrobe fit her any more. 

The marketing manager from Harlow, Essex, 33, had reached 12st 7lb and at 5ft 6in it was the heaviest she'd ever been - but after shedding nearly 3st over the next year, shrinking from a size 16 to a size 10, she had a new problem on her hands.

She said: 'My confidence soared. The only problem was that now, each morning, I was faced with a rail of clothes which were all too big for me.'

Eleanor Scotchbrook could no longer fit into her clothes after dropping 3st - so she revamped her wardrobe using charity shop finds. Pictured: Eleanor in a £4.50 Monsoon skirt and vintage £15 Longchamp bag

Eleanor had let her weight creep up, indulging her sweet tooth and eating large portions until she hit her landmark birthday and decided to go on a health kick.

But a new body demanded a new wardrobe.  

She said: 'I was in danger of looking like a small kid playing dressing up in her mum's closet and my over-sized wardrobe wouldn't cut the mustard in my new marketing officer job at a hospice either.

'Although I could afford to buy a few pieces including an extra skirt or two on eBay, it wasn't enough.'

And before working at St Clare Hospice as a marketing officer, she'd never have stepped foot inside a charity shop.

'Spending hours rummaging through rails in the vain hope of discovering a genuine vintage gem seemed far too much like hard work,' she said.

Eleanor was very pleased with a Dorothy Perkins beige dress (left) which she bought for £5

In her first week she found a pair of Kurt Geiger leather tan and gold studded sandals for only £15. 'A friend later told me she has the same pair in black and they cost more than £100!' she said

She bought a month's worth of secondhand clothes, which set her back just £200. One find was a fitted River Island dress (right) which cost just £7

'And I'd always thought charity shops were just full of Aunty Mildred’s musty old cast-offs.'

But St Clare Hospice had charity shops all around Essex. And so she decided to set herself a challenge.

She said: 'What if I could replenish my wardrobe with second-hand items? I liked the idea of a challenge and I decided to take it one step further. Every day for a whole month I'd wear a different item bought from one of their charity shops.

'I'd also post a selfie of me in my new outfit on social media.'

But she decided if she was going to go ahead she'd want it to be authentic. That meant finding clothes and accessories that she would genuinely pick off the shelf and buy from any other high street shop.

She says: 'My personal style is fairly conservative but I do know what suits me and my body shape. And my finds would have to see me through all different occasions - work, social events and the gym.

Now, the 30-year-old marketing officer (in a £6 Nike top found in a charity shop in Essex) feels fitter and healthier than ever before

'But would I be able to find 31 days' worth of items? And more importantly, would I look a wally?'

Her family and friends were doubtful, as was she at first.

She says: 'People kept saying I wouldn't be able to do it, while others pointed out I wouldn't know who’d warn them, or that they might smell. And I must admit I was a bit dubious.'

But she needn't have worried.

She says: 'On the first day I found a brand new, chic Topshop pencil skirt with the price tag still on it - but instead of £30 it was only £6.

She picked up a tailored white dress for just £6 (left) and a Levi denim jacket for £15 (right)

She asked took selfies and posted them on Instagram and Twitter, with the hashtag #SecondHandstyle

'The next day I found a gorgeous pair of Kurt Geiger leather tan and gold studded sandals for £15. A friend later told me she has the same pair in black and they cost more than £100.'

Subsequent finds included a Levi denim jacket, also £15, a new River Island dress for £7 and a Planet snakeskin shirt for £3.50.

'During other visits my luck continued with all sorts of great pieces, including a Monsoon fusion patterned skirt for £4.50, a Patra blue silky vest top in medium for £4, a Dorothy Perkins beige dress for £5 and a stripy purple and white Gap top for £4.50.

'I also found some fantastic accessories, including a pair of Ray Ban sunglasses for only a tenner and one of my best finds - a real vintage black leather Longchamp bag for £15.

'It had suffered slight wear and tear but I took it home, put some boot polish on it, gave it a buff and it came up looking brand new.'

Amazingly, after just six visits Eleanor had more than enough and couldn't wait to show off what she'd found.

So on the first day of the next month she kicked off her challenge by wearing a pale blue and white nautical dress that she'd picked up for £6.

She asked a colleague to take a picture of her in it and posted it on Instagram and Twitter, with the hashtag #SecondHandStyle and that morning she was inundated with likes, comments and retweets.

Eleanor, who works at St Clare Hospice in Essex, visited several charity shops in the area to find her 31 pieces of clothing and accessories 

Eleanor received a 'like' all the way from America for a Mad Men-inspired £4 St Michael pleated skirt (pictured)

As the month unfolded, her charity finds suited every occasion, a £6 Nike top she'd picked up for the gym, a pair of £4 floral lounge pants from Primark for a girly pizza night, the H&M skirt and denim jacket she'd found the first week which she wore out shopping with her sister.

She says: 'As I mixed and matched the pieces people couldn't believe what I'd managed to find. I had to convince some that it really was all secondhand and I wasn’t pretending.'

By now she'd picked up 600 followers on social media and as the month went by she received endless compliments.

She says: 'People were saying how much I’d inspired them and some asked if I’d go shopping with them.

One of her found treasures was a pair of £4 floral lounge pants from Primark (left), which she for a girly pizza night, and a £4 denim skater skirt £4 (right)

Eleanor (in her £15 Levi denim jacket) says the charity shop challenge has made her appreciate secondhand style, because 'you are very likely to find a one-off item that no-one else will have'

'I was also thrilled to get a "like" all the way from America when I wore a Mad Men-style St Michael’s beige and black check pleated skirt which I had bought for £4, because it reminded me of my maternal nan who used to work at Marks and Spencer.

'Probably at least 20 years old, I paired it with a simple black vest and smart black heels, bringing it bang up to date.'

By the end of the month Eleanor couldn't believe how much success she'd had.

She says: 'I had a wardrobe bursting with new clothes and the best part was it only cost me £200.

'I'd also managed to raise some money for the hospice as well as inspiring others to do the same.

'Now I still wear secondhand clothes every day. I've discovered the beauty of charity shops is you are very likely to find a one-off item that no-one else will have.'
