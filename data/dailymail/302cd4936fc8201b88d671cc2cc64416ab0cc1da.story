You know how the old saying goes when two people fall in love at first sight...their eyes met across a crowded room. Next they were being seduced by the open wounds all over each other's faces and lusting after the blood dripping from their snarling mouths. 

Okay, not quite. In fact not all, unless you're Kelly Buckley and her partner Tim Lamb who are planning a fairytale wedding after meeting as they played zombies in a horror movie.

Kelly, 30, fell for Tim Lamb, 39 after they were cast together alongside 300 other extras as flesh eating monsters who terrorise a community in a British film called The Eschatrilogy.

When Kelly Buckley first met her fiance Tim Lamb (left) it was love at first sight even though they were both covered head to toe in blood, mud and deep gashes (right)

Initially Kelly suffered a  set back when she forgot to get Tim's phone number.

But the pair met by chance again at a ghost hunt earlier this year and realised they had met previously on set. Now the couple are due to tie the knot after Tim popped the question.

Kelly, a mother of two from Sheffield, South Yorkshire said: 'We were going to have a zombie themed wedding but as it is going to be in Australia our latex make up would probably melt in the searing heat.

Kelly said she loved Tim's sense of humour straight away and the pair share a love of comics and superheros

Kelly and Tim only crossed over on the set of the independent movie for one day, losing contact for months

'As we both love comics, we're going to have a superhero themed wedding instead with the female guests playing damsels in distress in summer dresses whilst Tim will wear a Batman shirt. But we'll still be having a zombie element to the wedding as that is how we met - so in the vows we'll be saying we promise to save each other from a zombie apocalypse.'

Kelly met Tim in 2012 after she saw a Facebook post advertising for extras to appear in the movie which was filmed at a disused warehouse in Wakefield. She was among 300 extras who underwent an hour of make-up before the group were split into separate 'zombie hordes.'

She added: 'I had been single for a few years and thought that this zombie extra work would be a great opportunity to make some new friends.

'I arrived at 9am had all my makeup done by 11am and spent the rest of the day high on adrenaline.

'It certainly wasn't the kind of place I thought I would fancy anyone, everyone looked as realistic as the zombies in Walking Dead.

After meeting again by chance and adding each other on Facebook Kelly realised that he was her mystery zombie and within a few months they became a couple

'I just remember hearing this loud bloke a few meters away from me and remember everyone laughing at his jokes about zombies and about how he looked better with the make-up on rather than off - I liked him instantly.

'We really hit it off, both of us liked computer games and comic books but because the day was so busy I didn't have chance to get his number. Filming was ongoing for another three months so I was sure I would see him again - but I was absolutely gutted when he didn't turn up the next day.'

'The problem was I had no idea what he looked like, I spent a good few months keeping my eyes and ears out for him, but I never saw him after that. I spent hours searching for Tim during the three months of filming but unfortunately he'd finished his stint that day.'

Months later, by chance, the pair bumped into each other after she reluctantly went to a ghost hunting night with a friend. It was there she met a man who was also called Tim and they hit it off straight away.

The pairs love of dressing up means they will dress as superheros for their wedding in Australia, though unfortunately the heat means the latex zombie make up would have melted

After adding each other on Facebook Kelly realised that he was her mystery zombie and within a few months they became a couple. Tim moved from Leeds with his son Paul, 11, to be with Kelly and her daughters Paige, 12 and Millie, 6.

In June 2014 Tim proposed to Kelly at the same spot when they first met as zombies. Kelly said: 'When I met Tim again at the ghost hunting event, I didn't even realise it was him and didn't put two and two together.

'I had never seen Tim without his zombie make up on so for all I know he could have been anyone.'

Kelly has since donned her zombie costumes for numerous other events such as Tattoo shows, television work and even for an Alice Cooper.

She hopes to continue her zombie work and couldn't think of a better job.

She said: 'Tim only did extra work that one time, I think he found it quite long as we were there from 9am all the way up till 7pm.

'For me though I absolutely love it, I look forward to dressing up - I find the whole experience fascinating. Plus it gave me the love of my life, even if I didn't know what he looked like as a human. People have been joking with un-dead happy in love.'
