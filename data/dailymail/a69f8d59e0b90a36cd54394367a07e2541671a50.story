Rolling through a Russian shooting range these tanks armed with guns as helicopters fly overhead look like they are heading off to war.

But rather than preparing to go into battle, these tanks are actually taking part in the first International Tank Biathlon.

The competition, dubbed as the Tank Olympics, sees teams from 12 countries taking part in a racing and shooting contest, much like a standard Olympic biathlon competition.

The tanks taking part in the contest must negotiate several different obstacles and contend with Russian helicopters flying overhead

The tournament is being held on a shooting range in Alabino, near Moscow with 12 different countries taking part

The event kicked off last Monday and will run Saturday at the Alabino shooting range, on the outskirts of Moscow.

According to the rules, the tanks must negotiate a 20 kilometre course while facing various obstacles, including a slalom section, river shallows, a steep hill, a pontoon bridge and an escarpment, and shoot a set of targets along the way.

The tanks have also been facing obstacles in the way of Russian aircraft and infantry combat vehicles.

The twelve countries participating are Angola, Armenia, Belarus, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Russia, Serbia and Venezuela.

According to organisers, NATO countries including United States, Italy and Germany and Ukraine were asked to compete in the championships but declined.

All competitors are using the Russian T-72B tank apart from China, who have opted to use ZTZ-96s. So far, Russia have been victorious in the first two stages of the race, and the competition's winners will be rewarded with a Russian UAZ Patriot SUV each.

When the tournament began last week, like most sporting tournaments, an opening ceremony was held, which saw the tanks fire coloured smoke as they 'waltzed' in an almost ballroom dancing formation.

As the host nation, Russia also put on parade a series of historical tanks from World War Two as well as a missiles display.

Russian defence minister Sergey Shoygu also addressed the opening ceremony and was quoted by Interfax as saying: 'The constructed course will not only determine how prepared servicemen are, but also test the strength of the armoured vehicles

'Faced with the complicated international situation, the upcoming competitions are designed to promote trust and understanding between the armed forces of different countries.

'This championship is a testament to the desire and willingness of Russia to work on the development of international partnerships in the military sector.'
