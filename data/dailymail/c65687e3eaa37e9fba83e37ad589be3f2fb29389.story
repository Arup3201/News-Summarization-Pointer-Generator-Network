If there is any indication that you've 'made it', having your clothes styled by Rachel Zoe must surely be it.

That is certainly the case for Amy Heidemann and Nick Louis Noonan, better known as Karmin, the talented duo who shot to fame earlier this year with their single Brokenhearted, after hundreds of millions viewed their YouTube music videos.

Today, Coach released a behind-the-scenes video of the celebrity stylist creating the looks for the real-life couple's newest video, Sleigh Ride.

Scroll down for video and to see Rachel's favorite pieces from the shoot...

Holiday style: Amy Heidemann and Nick Louis Noonan, better known as Karmin, were styled by Rachel Zoe in Coach for their new video, Sleigh Ride

Festive atmosphere: Rachel, Nick and Amy all semed in high spirits throughout the shoot

Nick and Amy, both 26, were dressed 
head-to-toe in winter must-haves from the fashion giant's collection - a
perfect fit for the holiday theme of the video, which will premiere next week.

In fact, even Rachel couldn't resist trying on the furry hats and cosy duffle coats, insisting, in typical style, that they were 'maj' and that she was 'obsessed'.

Sixties siren: Amy looked every inch the retro belle with her bold flicks of black eyeliner

Strike a pose... From fedoras to beehives, Amy pulled off each and every one of Rachel's looks

Amy, who was styled with a towering 
beehive and Sixties-style black eyeliner, admitted that she had long 
been a fan of the stylist's Bravo show.

'I'm much more into fashion than Nick, he's, like, a T-shirt and jeans king,' she said. 'That's his swagger though.'

That didn't seem to stop Nick from getting caught up in the lively atmosphere of the day.

In love: As well as performing together, Amy and Nick are a real-life couple too

He flashed a shy grin as Rachel 
announced, 'I'm anointing you cool', and looked well in his comfort zone
as he jammed with Amy for the on-set team.

Rachel was so impressed, she made sure to record the impromptu performance on her crystal-studded phone.

In turn, her styling got the Karmin seal of approval, both in terms of comfort and being in keeping with their image.

'We
try to incorporate a lot of personality into our music, and the clothes
have to sort of make sense with that,' Amy explained.

'We have to feel comfortable doing it - that's what it really comes down to. Does it feel good? Does it feel like you?'
