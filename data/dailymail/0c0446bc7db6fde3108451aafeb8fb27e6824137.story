A video of a six-month-old baby standing up on his proud father’s open hand has become a global viral sensation.

Lennox Smith balances perfectly on 32-year-old Sandy’s right hand over a bed in the 44-second video which has been viewed more than two million times.

Mother Simone, 32, a make-up artist from Partick, Glasgow, said yesterday: “Ever since I put the video up it’s all been a bit mad. I never expected it would go this far. 

Lennox Smith shows a natural aptitude for balancing on father Sandy's hand, with just a wee spot of help

“It wasn’t planned at all – it was one of those moments that just happens.

“We were trying to help him learn to stand by working his back muscles and Sandy just lifted Lennox up on his hand and then Lennox just let go and he was standing up on his own.

“He has really good balance even though he can’t really stand yet.

“I was really surprised when he stayed standing up on Sandy’s hand. I didn’t expect him to stay upright.

“Sandy plays with Lennox all the time. Lennox is still too young to play with teddies or anything.

“Lennox is so laid back. His nursery say he is one of the happiest babies they’ve ever had.

“He’s very much like us – very happy and easy going.

“Everyone in the family thinks it’s really funny and they’ve all been sharing the video. It’s amazing how it’s taken off.”
