A Canadian model was allegedly involved in smuggling over 50,000 MDMA pills and about 40 kilograms of the drug before being apprehended at a California airport on Thursday.

Krista Marieann Boseley and fellow Canadian Gilles Joseph Pierre Lapointe were both charged in the incident, documents obtained by The Smoking Gun reveal.

Boseley was photographed during an open call for Playboy and is reportedly a real estate agent, according to the website.

Authorities went to John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana on Thursday to search for a plane, '[b]ased on an investigation in another district [...] that the airplane or its occupants may be involved in the smuggling of narcotics or currency,' the documents say.

Boseley and Lapointe were seen by plain clothes investigators arriving at the airport, taking their luggage out the private plane, and going to a rental car desk before they were stopped outside near the rented vehicle, according to the court documents.

Lapointe was spoken to separately by investigators, one of whom wrote in the affidavit that he 'immediately saw a large sum of United States currency' after opening the man's backpack.

The documents say Lapointe told investigators the $13,000 found was actually casino winnings from the Bellagio Hotel.

Boseley reportedly told authorities the $7,500 in her purse was also Bellagio casino winnings

After using a drug dog, authorities later found 'approximately 30,000' MDMA pills in Lapointe's carry-on luggage, according to the documents.

An additional 28,000 MDMA pills and 40 kilograms of the drug were found during a search of the plane, along with a GPS tracker detector, the documents say.

During the investigation, it was revealed 'that Boseley was stopped approximately September 16, 2013, by the Los Angeles Police Department and she was found with over $40,000 in cash. Boseley stated at that time that the money belonged to someone else.' 

It does not appear Boseley is behind bars, though Lapointe currently is, The Smoking Gun reported.
