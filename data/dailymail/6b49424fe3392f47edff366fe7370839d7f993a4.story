A coffee addict splashed out £500 a month at Starbucks after vowing to only eat and drink at the chain for a year.

The mother-of-two named Beautiful Existence set herself the 365-day challenge at the beginning of 2013 and has documented her daily intake online.

The PhD student, from Seattle, Washington, ate breakfast, lunch and dinner at the coffee chain, spending around £16 a day, amounting to nearly £6,000 over the course of the year.

She even enjoyed her birthday, Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas meals at her local Starbucks.

Beautiful, who legally changed her name, said: 'I focused on Starbucks as they are a Pacific Northwest brand and this is my home - I am proud of what we produce for the world.

'I am fearless and wanted to explore new things in my life - I love to test the water and each time I challenge myself, I learn a lot.

'During the year there's not been anything I have really hated, with a limited menu you learn not to be a picky eater pretty quick.

'But there's only a few days left before I get to eat what I want again, needless to say I'm very excited.'

Breakfast:

Blueberry oatmeal £1.80

Latte from Verismo coffee machine £0.61

Banana £0.61

Evolution Fresh Orange Juice £1.80

Lunch:

Protein Bistro Box £3.65

Snack:

Evolution Fresh bar £1.80

Dinner:

Tomato & Provolone Panini £3.65

Dessert:

Chocolate croissant £1.20

Latte from Verismo coffee machine £0.61

TOTAL DAILY SPEND: £15.73

The full-time mum Beautiful has whittled her way through the entire menu dozens of times over.

She
 usually starts her day with a latte, blueberry porridge, fruit and 
glass of fruit juice before tucking into a hot sandwich at lunch.

Beautiful then enjoys either salads or paninis for her evening meal, all the while downing caffeine drinks along the way.

She admits it wasn't always easy sticking to such a restrictive diet.

Beautiful added: 'There's only a few 
more days to go before I can eat something different for a change and I 
can't wait - it'll probably be a favourite meal from my childhood.

'The 
first few months were extremely easy but as the months ticked by I had 
to really remain focussed on getting to the end.

'The countdown to the 
end has finally begun - and I can finally give in to my cravings.'

After successfully completing her challenge, Beautiful has set herself the aim of completing a new annual challenge for the next 20 years.

Beautiful added: 'The first year long challenge I did was so fantastic that it has lead to me map out more than 25 years worth of personal challenges that I am yet to explore.

'Everything from politics to pennies, coffee to communities and everything in between. I just want to explore what defines our existence and write all about it on my blogs.

'I had no idea that the world would hear about my challenge, let alone be so passionate about it. But what all my challenges come down to are the connections I make with my readers.

'The people that all become part of my year and how they help to shape my challenge day-by-day.'
