Valentine's Day provides the perfect romantic opportunity for smitten partners to pop the question and from flash mobs to flying banners, proposal methods are getting more and more lavish.

But for hopeful romantics feeling the pressure of finding an original and romantic way of getting down on one knee, help is at hand.

Luxury website, VeryFirstTo, is offering one individual the opportunity to propose to their loved one in the UK's first-ever Valentine's Day marriage proposal advert on national TV.

Not one to stick to traditions? Now you can propose on TV in the UK's first wedding proposal on Channel 4

The romantic stunt will cast the proposer as the star of a specially crafted commercial on Channel 4 dedicated to persuading his/her loved one to say 'yes' - but it doesn't come cheap.

The 30-second ad will cost the hopeful romantic a staggering £135,000.

But no expense will be spared as the commercial will be produced by the world's leading visual effects studio for advertising and film, MPC, which has helped craft numerous famous ads including recent favourites for John Lewis, Virgin Atlantic and Channel 4 Paralympics.

MPC will work closely with the ad's hero to ensure that the 30-second film best delivers the message he or she wants to convey.

Lavish proposal: The TV opportunity will set you back a cool £135,000

While costs include the creation and production of the 
ad, plus buying the air time, a £2,000 donation will be made to the 
Variety Club Children’s Charity to mark the momentous event.

Marcel Knobil, brand expert and VeryFirstTo founder said: 'We are delighted to offer the ultimate opportunity to literally broadcast one's love.

'This is yet another example of VeryFirstTo's commitment to enable individuals to be the very first to have newly launching luxury products and experiences.'

VeryFirstTo.com dubs itself 'the first website for individuals to learn about, and have, newly launching luxury products and experiences.'

Luxury website: The opportunity is available on VeryFirstTo's website which also sells the £160,000 Azature nail polish and £315,000 Z. boat

It aims to showcase the most desirable 
items within the world of technology, fashion, home, leisure, beauty and
beyond; as well as the latest must attend venues and events.

Extravagant items to have featured include the £160,000 Azature 267 carat black diamond nail polish that Kelly Osbourne made famous, a £315,000 Z.Boat by Zaha Hadid and a £4,500 24-carat Faberge-inspired egg.

All the items have been hand-picked by connoisseurs such as model Poppy Delevingne and It girl and DJ Bip Ling.
