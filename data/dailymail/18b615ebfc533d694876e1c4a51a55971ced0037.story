At least 10 children are believed to have drowned when a boat carrying around 250 migrants capsized off the Italian island of Lampedusa yesterday, following a shipwreck last week which left more than 300 dead.

Authorities said 221 people were rescued in a joint Italian-Maltese operation following the incident about 60 miles (100 km) south of the island.

However the Italian news agency ANSA reported that around 50 dead bodies have been sighted, 10 of which were children.

The capsizing of the boat occurred in waters where Malta has search and rescue responsibilities.

The coastguard received a
satellite phone call from the boat and was able to locate it based on 
the satellite coordinates.

A Maltese armed forces aircraft spotted the wreckage initially and asked for Italy's help.The boat was spotted in difficulty by a Maltese military plane at around 1400 GMT, which dropped a liferaft.

Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told a news conference in Valletta there were indications at least 27 people had died 'and the number is expected to rise, possibly drastically'.

He said 150 survivors were rescued aboard a Maltese ship. An Italian patrol boat had another 56 survivors, while a fishing boat had 15, said Cmdr. Marco Maccaroni of the Italian navy. 

'This is not just another wake-up 
call for Europe. This is the time for action,' Muscat said, adding he 
had spoken to Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta to discuss the latest 
disaster.

'This is a European problem, not a problem for Italy or Malta only.'

In a separate incident 12 migrants were killed when a boat sank off the Egyptian coast yesterday leaving 116 survivors.

The Egyptian navy responded to a 
distress call near the city of Alexandria, the official news agency 
said, adding that 72 Palestinians, 40 Syrians, and four Egyptians 
survived the shipwreck.

Italy is asking for more European Union support and an overhaul of the bloc's immigration rules after last week's shipwreck.

Last
week, a ship carrying some 500 Eritrean and Somali migrants capsized 
off Lampedusa, killing more than 300 people. Only 155 survived.

The
deaths have prompted calls for the European Union to do more to better 
patrol the southern Mediterranean and prevent such tragedies.

Last
week's disaster was one of the worst in a long migrant crisis that has 
seen tens of thousands of people arriving in small, unsafe boats in 
southern Italy.

Earlier today, at least 500 more 
migrants in at least three separate boats arrived or were rescued on the
way to different parts of Sicily.

In
the first operation, a Maltese vessel rescued around 200 migrants on 
two rubber dinghies who had put out an SOS call while still in Libyan 
waters.

Meanwhile, a 
boat flying a Bahamas flag came to the aid of 118 migrants - and in a 
third incident, a Navy vessel called on a tugboat to rescue 175 migrants
from another two boats.

Lampedusa, a tiny island located midway between Sicily and Tunisia, has borne the brunt.

According
to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 32,000 have 
arrived in southern Italy and Malta this year alone, around two thirds 
of whom have filed requests for asylum.

Although most migrants come from 
sub-Saharan Africa, this year many are fleeing the Syrian civil war or 
political turmoil in Egypt and other parts of North Africa.

Many are drawn by hopes of finding work in Europe and often do not stay in Italy.

'Refugees from Syria have fled the depths of despair to seek safety in Egypt,' said Amnesty expert Sherif Elsayed-Ali.

'But
instead of providing shelter and hope for a new life, the Egyptian 
authorities' actions are compelling many refugees from Syria into 
life-threatening situations, including entrusting their lives to 
smugglers in order to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean
Sea."

Once welcomed with open arms, many of the Syrians who took 
refuge in Egypt are now targeted by hate speech and intimidation.

Their 
dramatic change in fortune is one of the unexpected consequences of the 
Egyptian military's ouster of President Mohammed Morsi, whose 
Islamist-dominated government had offered them favorable conditions.

Lampedusa is also the destination of choice of smugglers ferrying migrants from Libya or Tunisia to Europe.

They usually charge more than 1,000 euro (£850) a head and cram the migrants onto boats that routinely run into trouble and require rescue.

During a visit to Lampedusa this week, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso promised Italy some 30million euro in EU funds to better care for newly arrived migrants, and Italian officials pledged to put the issue on the agenda of an upcoming European Union summit.
