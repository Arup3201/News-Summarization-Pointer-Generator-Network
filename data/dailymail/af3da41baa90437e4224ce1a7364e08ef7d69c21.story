In an interview in 2010, when taking a post in the Wounder Warrior program, he said: 'The best day and the worst day of my life was when I served in Mogadishu, Somalia, on October 3, 1993, as a part of Task Force Ranger.

'It was the worst day, because we lost 18 Soldiers and 84 others, including myself, were wounded. It was the best day of my life because it showed the incredible performance of our warriors in long-protracted battle under extraordinary circumstances in an urban environment. 

'Throughout it all, the warriors that fought that day performed in a manner that was consistent with the values of our nation, and I was very proud of that.'
