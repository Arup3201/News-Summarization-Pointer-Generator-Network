A study published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that 'consumers who use products to boost their sense of self-worth tend to dwell on their shortcomings'

Hitting the shops after heartbreak or not getting a promotion does not make you happy and even backfires by making you think more about your failures, a new study warned

Retail therapy is thought to make you feel better when you treat yourself to that luxury watch or bag that you have always coveted when faced with a disappointment.

But in fact you are more likely to dwell on your problems than others.

Researchers found consumers who buy luxury products after a personal failure are simply masking the issue rather than recovering.

The study by Monika Lisjak of the Erasmus University, Andrea Bonezzi of New York University, Soo Kim of Cornell University, and Derek Rucker of Northwestern University showed shoppers who buy to boost their self-worth could actually feel worse.

They said: “When consumers experience a psychological threat to how they would like to see themselves, buying products that signal accomplishment in the same area of their life could ironically cause them to dwell on their shortcomings.

“This can strip consumers of their mental resources and impair their self-control.”

The study invited participants to recall a time when their intelligence was undermined and what they did about it.

Results showed that those who opted for a form of retail therapy were unhappier in the longer term.

The researchers concluded: “Consumption can sometimes compensate for our blunders and failures, but this doesn’t always work.

“Consumers who use products to boost their sense of self-worth tend to dwell on their shortcomings and their ability to exert self-control is impaired.

“After experiencing a setback in one area of their life, consumers might be better off boosting their sense of self in a different area of their life.

“For example, a consumer whose intelligence is undermined might be better off signalling their self-worth socially rather than trying to assert their intelligence.”

The study was published in the Journal of Consumer Research.
