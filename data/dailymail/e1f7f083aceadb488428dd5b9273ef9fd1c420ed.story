Once Sloanes wore Alice bands, pearls and spent the weekends traipsing around the family estate, faithful spaniel in tow. Not anymore.

The Sloane Ranger has evolved into the Sloane Raver: posh, pretty and with plans to party hard - wherever in the world they might be.

Led by the Delevingne sisters, Poppy and Cara, London's coolest new style tribe have upstaged Dalson's hipsters; swapping the girls in pearls stereotype for neon shorts and bovver boots, and their spaniels for Harry Styles.

So who are the Sloane Ravers? Femail makes the introductions.

Sister act: Models Poppy and Cara Delevingne are leading lights of the hard-partying Sloane Raver set

In demand: Cara Delevingne, 22, is one of the fashion world's hottest names and a party circuit regular

THE STANDOUT SLOANE: CARA DELEVINGNE

Never far from the headlines thanks to her penchant for One Direction boybanders and an outlandish approach to fashion, model Cara is the leader of the Sloane Raver pack.

Described as 'the new Kate [Moss]' by Mario Testino, 22-year-old Cara has a background that's pure Sloane and is the daughter of former debs' delight, property developer Charles Delevingne, and his wife Pandora - a close friend of the Duchess of York.

Regularly seen falling out of nightclubs with her 'wifey', singer Rita Ora, in tow, she's no stranger to controversy - most recently when a suspicious looking packet of white powder fell out of her pocket in front of the paparazzi - although that hasn't stopped her from becoming a designer darling. Even the notoriously hard-to-impress Karl Lagerfeld loves her.

THE STYLISH SLOANE: SOPHIA HESKETH

The
Sloane answer to super-stylist, Katie Grand, 28-year-old Sophia is the 
daughter of Tory grandee, Lord Hesketh, 28-year-old Sophia and a 
familiar face on the London party circuit.

Extremely well-connected, Hesketh has worked with everyone from Kate Moss to Lara Stone and has contributed to Vogue Nippon, as well as Motilo Magazine, where she regularly shares her pearls of style wisdom.

Despite her penchant for a party - the heiress splits her time between St Tropez, Ibiza and London - she's no stranger to sport and came second at the National Athletic Championships aged 15.

THE SUPER-COOL SLOANE: LADY MARY FURZE

Model, DJ and style icon in the making, 24-year-old Lady Mary Furze has worked with the fashion world's biggest names and has posed for US and British Vogue, and Vanity Fair among others.

Like her aunt Daphne Guinness, she pushes the boundaries with her unconventional sense of style - even during her wedding to Big Pink guitarist, Robbie Furze, when she wore a daring cutaway gown by Lady Gaga's favourite designer, Pam Hogg and was joined at the altar by her dog, Alfie.

'I always liked clothes but I never really understood them - but then I spent so much time with Daphne and Issy [Isabella Blow],' she revealed in an interview with Vogue.

'She took me to Monaco for a Fashion Rocks event once and just walked up to Donatella Versace and ordered her to dress me.

'Versace were meant to be dressing Mariah Carey for the event but they dropped everything and flew in some clothes to fit me especially  - that's what was so remarkable about Issy. Anyone she talked to - they just did things for  her, anything really. She was amazing.'

THE SOON-TO-BE-ROYAL SLOANE: CRESSIDA BONAS

A recent addition to the Sloane Raver set, Cressida Bonas was relatively unknown until she struck up a relationship with the third in line to the throne.

But Prince Harry's girlfriend has no shortage of blue blood: she's the daughter of Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon and the sister of Prince William's former love, Isabella Antruther-Gough-Calthorpe.

Not surprisingly, the blonde model and dance student, 24, is seriously well-connected and was introduced to Prince Harry by his cousin, Princess Beatrice.

She even attended the same university - Leeds - as Prince Harry's former flame, Chelsy Davy, and once dated Harry Wentworth-Stanley whose father is cousin to the Queen.

Although she's yet to go on record about her royal relationship, Cressida was pictured with Prince Harry at Glastonbury last month and is rumoured to have moved into his apartment at Kensington Palace.

THE SUBTLE SLOANE: POPPY DELEVINGNE

The older sister of model-of-the-moment Cara, Poppy Delevingne might be quieter than her raucous sister but she's just as successful.

The 26-year-old has worked with a who's who of big name brands including Cartier, Agent Provocateur, Anya Hindmarch and Burberry. She's also a brand ambassador for Chanel and has appeared on the runway for Julien MacDonald and Matthew Williamson among others.

Like her sister Cara, she's often pictured out and about in London and joined her younger sibling and their mutual friends at Glastonbury.
