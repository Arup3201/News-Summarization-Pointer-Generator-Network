As her husband George tore into the wrapping paper of his 50th birthday present, Anita Rydzinski tried to suppress a giggle.

She had spent weeks racking her brain over what to buy him. But how do you surprise your husband after 15 years of marriage?

A unique piece of artwork was just the thing, Anita decided. But as George pulled off the bubble wrap, it quickly became clear this gift was not your run-of-the-mill watercolour. It was a life-sized bronze cast of Anita's bottom, in suspenders and a tiny thong.

'George's mouth dropped open, then spread into a huge smile,' says Anita, 40. 'He couldn't believe it, but he did look at me and say, “Very nice . . .” Our daughter Chelsey, 19, thought it was fantastic, but our 13-year-old son George just stared and said, “What is that?”'

So what possessed Anita to commission such an intimate portrait of her posterior?

Anita, who lives in Wraysbury, Middlesex, and runs a turbo engine manufacturing company with her husband, says: 'George is very difficult to buy for, so when I spotted Brighton Body Casting, it gave me an idea.

'I wanted something a bit naughty, so decided on a cast of my bottom.'

Turning body parts or personal objects into art is becoming a major trend - over the past few years it has rocketed in popularity, particularly in showbusiness.

Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden recently admitted she has a cast of her bottom hanging in her bedroom - which was made at the request of her husband Chris in 2006.

Myleene Klass posted pictures of herself on Twitter in 2011 plaster casting her own baby bump when she was pregnant with daughter Hero, now two. 

Casting finally went A-list when the Beckhams reportedly spent £1,000 having daughter Harper's tiny hands and feet cast and plated in gold after she was born.

Sir Elton John, Joanna Lumley and Helena Bonham Carter are also said  to be fans of the technique and are all thought to have commissioned their own or their children's plaster casts.

Plaster casting has been used since the 19th century to create exact replicas of ancient sculptures, but it has now been replaced by alginate, a blue seaweed-based substance similar to the putty used by dentists to take moulds of your mouth.

It sets in two minutes, then turns rubbery, so you just pop a baby's foot - or a woman's bottom - into it then pull it out when it's firm to form a mould.

This is then filled with the chosen material: brass, plaster, bronze, glass, fibreglass, silver or, if you have the cash, gold.

Anita opted for fibreglass, to make it light enough to hang on a wall, which was then covered with powdered bronze. The entire thing cost £2,000.

For the process itself, Anita had to strip down to her undies before Vaseline and then alginate was spread over her bottom, lower back and legs while she stood stock-still for 40 minutes.

Her mother and daughter kept her company throughout. 'I was very nervous beforehand, so it really helped to have them there. It turned out to be fun once I got over my nerves, although it was agony, as I couldn't move an inch or it would spoil the cast.'

The result, she said, was a pleasant surprise.

'I was paranoid it would look awful, so I couldn't believe how much I liked it,' she says. 'It's not obscene, just cheeky, and George loves it. I think we're going to hang it in the lounge. I can't wait to see people's reactions at our next dinner party.'

Judy Wiseman has created casts for numerous celebrities through her company First Impressions - she's rumoured to be the creator of Harper Beckham's golden feet - and has seen many unusual requests.

'One client's husband proposed to her with a ring woven from grass, so she had it cast in silver as a permanent reminder. Another has a piece of bubblegum that she was chewing when she first kissed her husband when they were 14 - that's now mounted on a silver ring.

'I've even cast a shard of wood that was stuck in a man's knee after an accident: he wanted a reminder of how lucky he was to be alive.'

One of the most unusual requests came from 42-year-old artist Angela Jarman, who came up with an unlikely memento of her daughter Flora's birth two years ago. She asked Judy to create a silver pendant replica of the end of Flora's umbilical cord, still in its medical clip.

'It's individual to us, which makes it all the more precious,' says Angela, who lives in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, with her partner David, 41, an insurance broker.

'The cord was a bit gruesome, it shrivelled up and turned black, but I kept it because it represented my life flowing into our daughter. Cast in silver, it really has a magical quality. It's all about capturing a moment in time.'

This seems to be the key to the popularity of casting - preserving a physical memory for ever.

Perhaps that's why body casting has become so popular with women in their 30s, 40s and 50s, eager to capture an image of their body before age takes its toll.

British body caster Jamie McCartney, who opened Brighton Body Casting in 2006 after working in special effects on films such as Casino Royale, says: 'Ninety per cent of my body clients are female. They tend to be slightly older, partly due to having fewer body hang-ups, and partly down to cost.

'The average spend is probably £1,000. You can spend £25 on a pair of lips, but the full body cast I'm doing for an American client will cost more than £10,000.'

Trained sculptor Jamie says breasts, bottoms and female torsos are favourites with customers, but he is keen to point out that casting is not all salacious or sexual.

He says that he provides as a 'cradle to grave' service.

'The most disturbing thing I ever cast was the hand of a baby who had been stillborn at full term,' he says. 'I never met the family - it was done in the funeral parlour with just me and the funeral director.

'It's become increasingly common for families to ask for casts of loved ones who have terminal illnesses. I cast my own father's hand holding a wine glass before he died of prostate cancer, so I can still say “cheers” to him now.'

Another moving experiences involved casting the clasped hands of a husband and wife while she was in a hospice dying of cervical cancer.

Her widower, Chris Cutmore, 42, is a community psychiatric nurse who lives in Maidstone, Kent, with his daughter Rebekah, 17, and son Jamie, seven. His wife Karyn was diagnosed aged 34 with a rare, aggressive form of cancer in October 2007. She died a year later.

During Karyn's final days, Chris heard Jamie talk on local radio about body casting and arranged for him to visit.

'It was such an overwhelming experience,' says Chris. 'It was so tactile, our hands clasped together - it felt like getting married again. It was a little moment of light in an awful year.'

He says that he still remembers the look on Karyn's face when she received the bronze-plated cast the next day.

'The smile that lit up her face was unbelievable,' says Chris. 'The cast sat by her side until she slipped away a day later.

'People take it for granted, holding hands, but sometimes there is nothing more powerful.'

Five years on, the cast is in Chris's living room in a display case, next to glass casts of his two children's hands.

'It's a comfort to have them there,' says Chris. 'Looking at them transports me back to that moment with Karyn more than a picture ever could.'
