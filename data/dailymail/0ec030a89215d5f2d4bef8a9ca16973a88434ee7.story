SCROLL DOWN FOR THE SHOCKING VIDEO

Don't believe in ghosts? A spooky surveillance video from a store in Gilford, New Hampshire has even skeptics reconsidering their opinion of the supernatural.

Footage from the Ellacoya Country Store in Gilford shows a glass cake tray top being mysteriously thrown from the table and shattering on the ground after store employee Heidi Boyd leaves the room.

Upon hearing the noise, Heidi rushes back inside to see what the raucous was and is terrified to discover that a glass object managed to propel itself from the table and into a scattered pile of sharp glass shards.Â

The glass tray merely rests on the store counter

Suddenly the glass seems to fly off the table as if being propelled by some force

The glass becomes scattered all over the floor after flying mysteriously from the counter top

Store owner Steve Buzzota told WMUR that while objects haven't traveled by themselves before to his knowledge, customers and employees have sensed a ghostly presence and have even 'felt their shoulders being pulled. '

The video was first shared on the Ellacoya Barn & Grille Facebook page which is connected to the store, with the tag line, 'Haunted much?'

Since then, skeptics have questioned the validity of the tape. Some say they think that the glass was yanked from a string out the window. As a WMUR reporter pointed out however, the window doesn't open.

The Mail Online called the store to inquire about the event and other ghostly happenings. What employees and neighbors experienced was more chilling tales of the bizarre.

Employee Nicole Brandt was not at the Ellacoya Country Store at the time that they glass shattered but she said that strange sounds occur from time to time with no apparent source.

She said that when she works at the deli
 counter cutting meat, she hears people entering the room but when she 
turns around to greet customers no one is there.

Upon hearing glass shatter, Bonnie re-enters the room to look for the source of the sound

Bonnie is shocked to see the glass scattered on the floor with no explanation as to how it fell

'You can't see who's up front,' she said. 'It sounds like someone's there and no one's there.'

She also said that someone could hear whistling sometimes.

She said that the restaurant connected to the house was originally a barn but that the store was once a person's residence. She doesn't know firsthand who lived in the home.

The tenant upstairs from the store chimed in and said he heard strange noises.

He said that after the store is closed and everyone has left the vicinity, he starts hearing noises downstairs as if someone were there.

He can hear what sounds like someone or something coming from up the stairs walking down to the seemingly vacated room.

A fellow employee enters the store and Bonnie is absolutely horrified by the mysterious happening

She cleans up the mess but the ghostly memory of that day will haunt her forever
