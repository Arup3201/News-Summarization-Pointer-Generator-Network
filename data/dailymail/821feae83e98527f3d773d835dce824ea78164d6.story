The House stenographer who had to be dragged out of the chamber last week after a religious rant at the end of the shutdown debate has been put on administrative leave.

During the vote on legislation to end the debt deadlock last Wednesday, Dianne Reidy began shouting about God, Freemasons and a 'House divided'.

The 48-year-old. who has worked on the House floor for eight years, had been expecting to return to work yesterday, but that has now been delayed.

Outburst: Dianne Reidy is forcibly removed from the House chamber after her about God and the Freemasons

'She's on admin leave pending further review of the incident,' an aide told the Huffington Post yesterday.

Her husband later said his wife had been 
awakened by the Holy Spirit and had been told to deliver a message on 
the House floor.

CSpan viewers caught the rant as they 
watched vote tallies on TV last week. As security officers escorted Mrs 
Reidy to the hallway her shouts could still be heard.

Messenger: Dianne Reidy said she was prompted to speak by the Holy Spirit

Because of decorum rules, the outburst has cast doubt on Mrs Reidy's future in the House, where she earns $126,050 a year.

A spokesman for the House Clerk's Office refused to comment, telling the Huffington Post she was not authorized to discuss personnel matters.

In a written statement after the outburst, Mrs Reidy said: 'For the past 2 and 1/2 weeks, the Holy Spirit has been waking me up in the middle of the night and preparing me (through my reluctance and doubt) to deliver a message in the House Chamber. That is what I did last night.'

Her husband, Dan, said he was proud of his wife, who he called 'a sweet, level-headed wonderful woman of God'.

Mrs Reidy was interviewed by Capitol police before being taken to hospital for evaluation after she took control of the microphone.

'He will not be mocked. He will not be mocked- don't touch me- He will not be mocked,' she had called out.

'The greatest deception here is this is not one nation under God. It never was. Had it been it would not have been. It would not have been.

'The Constitution would not have been written by Freemasons. They go against God. You cannot serve two masters. You cannot serve two masters. Praise be to God. Lord Jesus Christ. Praise be to Jesus.'

On her Facebook page, Mrs Reidy is a fan of several Christian-oriented groups, including the evangelical In Touch Ministries, led by TV preacher Charles Stanley.

She does not drink, do drugs or have any medication issues, and was released from the hospital.

'I’m glad that I fulfilled God’s mission for me, absolutely. It lifted a tremendous burden. It was a very hard burden to carry as you can imagine,' she said in an interview with The New York Post.

Her husband spoke for the majority of the interview, saying that the late nights that she worked during the shutdown drove her to the brink.

'God was preparing her for this vote 
last night, because this was kind of the culmination of everything,' Mr Reidy told The Post.

'This
was the big one. Everybody’s there. And Dianne didn’t know what she was
sharing, she didn’t know when — but she just sensed in her spirit.'

Mrs Reidy has worked as a stenographer for two decades and the past eight of those years were for the House Clerk- a job she reportedly enjoys because she appreciates the archaic parliamentary order to the ways that laws are passed and debates are organized.

Mr Reidy told The Daily Beast that his wife took her job so seriously that she refused to call in sick even when she was suffering from morning sickness while pregnant with the couple's twin daughters.

'This whole mess has just kind of sickened her to the whole process,' he said of her disgust with what had been going on during the federal shutdown.

'The alliances between people who aren’t really allies. The finger-pointing on the dais, [then] the arms around each other… Where are the people being served in this whole deal?

'She was just like, "Gosh, this is not what it’s about."'

Attention: Those in earshot of Mrs Reidy could be seen looking at her during the outburst

The couple are open about their devout
religious beliefs. 'Reading a Bible is not foreign to us, but getting 
up in the middle of the night definitely is. It’s just not a part of our
life,' Mr Reidy told the Daily Beast.

'What
she was finding out was that God was impressing on her heart that He 
had a message He wanted her to share with the House of Representatives.'

CSPAN was recording the scene and had 
the screen blocked with the breakdown of the vote that had just happened
to approve the debt ceiling increase and temporary budget agreement.

Though it was not a clear shot, it was possible to see Mrs Reidy approach the microphone and begin gesticulating.  

A GOP aide told CNN: 'She’s a well-known person, she’s a perfectly nice person, a good colleague, somebody who’s respectable and dependable, and this is very surprising to everybody who works with her. I don't know, she just snapped.'
