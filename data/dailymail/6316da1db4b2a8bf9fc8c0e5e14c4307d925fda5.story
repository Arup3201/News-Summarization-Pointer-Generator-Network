An unsettling new study has revealed a surging number of sexually-transmitted infections in the U.S. - especially among young adults - the CDC reports.

The new survey reports that about 20 million Americans were diagnosed with an STI in 2008 (the most recent year data was available).

That figure brings the total number of existing cases diseases to more than 110 million.

For girls ages 14 to 19, the study found a 56 percent reduction in the types of HPV virus targeted by the shots

A recent study showed that more than 20 per cent of infections (22.1 million) were among women and men aged 15 to 24 years

The study says: 'Of these, more than 20 per cent of infections (22.1 million) were among women and men aged 15 to 24 years.

'Approximately 19.7 million incident infections occurred in the United States in 2008; nearly 50 per cent (9.8 million) were acquired by young women and men aged 15 to 24 years.'

Sexually transmitted infections are 
common in the United States, with a disproportionate burden among young 
adolescents and adults.

The number of new infections in the 
country has been growing over the last couple decades, a startling 
epidemic among sexually active Americans, mostly between the ages of 15 
and 24.

Previous studies reported 15 
million new infections in 1996 and 18.9 million in 
2000.

Though researchers noted that the methods for gathering 
information about new infections back then were slightly different, and 
may account for some discrepancy in the numbers.

At risk: To combat the growing number, the CDC suggests focusing on prevention among young adolescents and at-risk populations to reduce the number and impact of STIs

Totals: Human papillomavirus (HPV) tops the list as the most common infection followed by herpes, trichomoniasis, chlamydia, HIV, hepatitis B, gonorrhea and syphilis

Human papillomavirus (HPV) tops the list
 as the most common infection followed by herpes, trichomoniasis, 
chlamydia, HIV, hepatitis B, gonorrhea and syphilis.

Much of the $16 billion in annual 
healthcare costs that go to STI's is spent on patients with HIV/AIDS, 
who require lifetime care.

But less serious infections aren't always less expensive.

Diseases
 like Chlamydia can lead to complications, especially if they are not 
treated, which can end up costing patients thousands of dollars out of 
pocket.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has revealed that 20 million new sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are diagnosed each year nationwide
