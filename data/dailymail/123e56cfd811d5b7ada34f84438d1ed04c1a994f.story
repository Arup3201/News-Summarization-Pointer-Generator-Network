A car thief and his stripper-girlfriend-accomplice  attempted to escape handcuffs in the back of a cop car by passing an earring during a kiss.

Jonathan Kokontis, 25, and his girlfriend Melissa Elaine Schneider, 27, were arrested on Saturday after trying to steal cars in Seminole County, Florida. 

After 911 calls from the Fern Park neighborhood reported a man and a woman, in pink shorts, stealing cars, officers apprehended the suspects.

Kokonitis at first fled, leaving his girlfriend behind but was later found in a shed. 

Former convict Kokontis was booked on charges including burglary, escape and robbery. He is being held at Seminole County Jail, according to the Orlando Sentinel. 

Schneider, a performer at Dancers Royale strip club in Orlando, was held on her own long list of charges including providing contraband to a felon.

According to the Sentinel, during their arrest, Schneider allegedly rubbed her head against her boyfriend's chest, pulling out an earring in the process which landed on his lap. 

He then tried to unlock his handcuffs with the earring. 

When that failed, Schneider allegedly then reached inside her bra and passed an unindentified object to her boyfriend via a kiss. Police did not identify what that object was.

The arresting officer saw the pair working to try to free themselves, so removed the 25-year-old from the car to recuff him. 

He then took off running to which his girlfriend shouted after him: '******* run!'

He was arrested trying to steal another car and was brought down using a police dog which bit his arm. He was hospitalized and then taken to jail.

Schneider was initially released but then arrested again the next day for beating a pregnant woman who had asked her for a cigarette and being found in possession of marijuana. 

The couple both have multiple prior convictions including grand theft auto.
