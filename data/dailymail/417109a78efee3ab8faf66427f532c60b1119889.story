Around 51 people have been arrested in New York as those observing the one-year anniversary of Occupy Wall Street again descended upon Lower Manhattan, the birthplace of the movement.

More than 300 people participated in the march on Saturday night, brandishing signs bashing the greed of financial giants like Goldman Sachs, and clashed with the NYPD.

Police patrolled the crowd and took at least a dozen people into custody near Trinity Church, which borders Zuccotti Park.

Police confirmed they made arrests 
but did not have the total number, as the arrests were still happening.

However, Susan Howard, the chapter coordinator for the National Lawyers 
Guild confirmed to the New York Daily News that at least 20 had been taken into police custody on Saturday night. By Sunday, that number had risen to 51.

Earlier
in the day, protesters gathered in Washington Square Park in Greenwich 
Village, and headed south down Broadway, chanting things like 'F*** the 
police!'

They
finally ended at Zuccotti Park, at which point the group then thinned 
out. The march was the first of three days of planned events, though the
official anniversary date is Monday.

Occupy Wall Street's protest against economic disparity eventually spread to other parts of the country and world.

However,
the movement has remained long-dormant after it failed to maintain 
momentum and faced strict opposition from New York’s law enforcement 
officials.

The group, which popularized the 
phrase 'We are the 99 per cent,' will attempt to surround the New York 
Stock Exchange and disrupt morning rush hour in the financial district, 
according to a movement spokeswoman.

Monday's
protests will cap a weekend of Occupy Wall Street seminars, music and 
demonstrations in New York, said Linnea Paton, 24, an OWS spokeswoman. 
Demonstrations are also planned in other U.S. cities, other OWS 
organizers said.

The 
grassroots movement caught the world by surprise last fall with a 
spontaneous encampment in lower Manhattan that soon spread to cities 
across North America and Europe.

Occupy
Wall Street briefly revived a long-dormant spirit of U.S. social 
activism, and drew enduring attention to economic injustice.

But the movement's colourful cast of theatrical demonstrators struggled through last winter to sustain the momentum that first drew attention to its patchwork of economic grievances - including corporate malfeasance on Wall Street, crippling student debt and aggressive bank foreclosures on American homes.

On Sunday, organizers will provide live music, including a Foley Square concert featuring Tom Morello, guitarist for the rock band Rage Against the Machine.

At 7am Monday, some protesters will try to surround the NYSE, while others will engage in a loosely choreographed series of 'sit-ins' at intersections throughout the financial district, according to OWS's website.

The tactics are designed to undermine New York police efforts to contain protesters on the narrow, winding streets of the financial district.

A Facebook invitation promoting the event tells protestors to arrive onsite wearing business or business casual clothing, explaining: ' This will help us blend in and make the job of the police more time-consuming.'

Last year's demonstrations featured the spectacle of activists breaking into sudden dashes down one narrow street or another, pursued by visibly frustrated police and television reporters tripping down cobblestone streets.

Sound permits for Sunday's events have been secured, Paton said, but OWS has not sought permits for Monday's protests - which last fall led to mass arrests and clashes between police and protesters. Occupy Wall Street maintains about $50,000 in its bail fund, several organizers said.

Chief New York Police Department spokesman Paul Brown confirmed that no OWS demonstration permit applications were submitted, but said police will be prepared for demonstrations.

'We accommodate peaceful protests and make arrests for unlawful activity,' he told Reuters.

Brown said that based on previous experience with OWS, the NYPD expects that 'a relatively small group of self-described anarchists will attempt unlawful activity and try to instigate confrontations with police by others while attempting to escape arrest themselves ... we expect most demonstrators to be peaceful.'

New York police have made a total of 1,852 Occupy arrests as of September 12, 2012, according to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's office, including the arrest of 700 protesters who spilled into the roadway while marching across the Brooklyn Bridge last October.

On Friday, Twitter was ordered by a New York judge to turn over the tweets of one of the protesters arrested on the bridge.

That case has emerged as a closely watched court fight over law enforcement access to users' social media content.

Six weeks after the Brooklyn Bridge arrests, citing public health concerns, New York authorities entered the Manhattan OWS camp and disbursed protesters. The movement has never regained its initial momentum.
