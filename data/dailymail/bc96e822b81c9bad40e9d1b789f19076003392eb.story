The 25-year-old man who sparked an Australian medical marijuana legalisation crusade has lost his battle with cancer.

Daniel Haslam passed away on Tuesday, after suffering from an aggressive form of bowel cancer for over four years. He was surrounded by his family and friends in Tamworth, regional New South Wales.

After the impact of his powerful national campaign to legalise medical marijuana, Daniel's mother Lucy has vowed she will continue carry on with his bid to legalise medical marijuana in Australia.

Mrs Haslam, a retired nurse who is also a fervent medical marijuana activist, told Daily Mail Australia about Daniel’s final days.

‘He kept fighting until the end, but it was extremely tough. His final days were spent in sheer exhaustion.’

‘I will continue working with NSW premier Mike Baird and will diligently work in the cross party parliamentary drug law reform group in Canberra.’

Mrs Haslam revealed to Daily Mail Australia she is also working with a prominent Australian journalist on a documentary on Dan’s plight called ‘A Life of its Own’.

The project hopes to ‘educate and dispel the many myths surrounding medicinal cannabis.’ 

 Lucy said Daniel was inspiring in his final days and didn't stop fighting until the end

The Haslam family are overwhelmed with the support they have been shown on an international scale

Mrs Harlamhas vowed to continue fighting for legalising medicinal marijuana for those who need it

She said the Haslam family are overwhelmed with the support they have been shown on an international scale.

‘He wasn’t seeking attention or glory, just the truth. Because of this Dan’s story touched thousands of people.’

She urged anyone who could benefit from medical cannabis to speak up and join the cause.

‘Tell your doctors and politicians this is just a medicine. They need to open their eyes to the truth and enable what is an accepted form of treatment throughout the developed world to be available to sick Australian’s,’ she said. 

Daniel had battled cancer for over four years, and found the effects of chemotherapy were devastating. 

Cannabis had provided solace for Daniel, unlike others such as antiemetic drugs which are supposed to relieve him from nausea and vomiting induced by cancer treatment.  

'As parents of three sons, Lou and I have always been opposed to recreational drug use,' Mrs Harlam said in a parliamentary speech in June.

One of Australia's largest nursing unions has taken the significant and potentially controversial step of supporting the use and possession of medical cannabis

'I resent that in a country where we can provide heroin injecting rooms and needle exchanges, where our government collects taxes from cancer causing tobacco and the biggest killer of all, alcohol, we are forced into criminality because our son is unlucky enough to be one of the thousands who has, through no fault of his own, contracted a life threatening disease,' she said.

Mrs Harlam had previously gained support from the NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association.The union, which has 59,000 members, collectively agreed that the drug could benefit patients suffering from constant chronic pain.   

In September the NSW government announced their support for a medical marijuana trial. Premier Mike Baird also declared his personal approval in parliament, and said he was moved by the story of Haslam.

'Why not take a stance to say to the rest of the country, this matters. It's time we did something about it,' Mr Baird said inparliament.

'So I say at the same time, we want to give the terminally ill and those around them, their carers, their family, greater peace of mind.'

In December, Mr Baird announced $9 million would be spent on  three trials of cannabis-derived medicines to test the benefits on patients suffering a range of debilitating illnesses.

He said hundreds of patients are set to take part in the trials.
