Labor senator Kate Lundy has announced her decision to quit politics.

Senator Lundy said she had decided not to contest the ACT Senate seat at the next federal election, a decision which had come after a period of deep reflection.

'Next March will mark 19 years since I was first elected to represent the ACT in the Australian Senate,' she said in a statement.

'I will work with the ACT ALP to ensure a smooth transition over the next six months.'

Senator Lundy, 46, a former union official, was elected to the Senate in 1996, holding a range of opposition and ministerial positions.

She said it had been an honour to serve the people of Canberra for almost two decades.

Senator Lundy said it was important to have a strong opposition to oppose cuts to public service pay and conditions, to protect Medicare and keep universities accessible.

She made the announcement on Twitter on Wednesday night 

'With political battles raging on a range of fronts for the Australian community – challenges such as fighting against APS cuts and condition reductions, protecting Medicare, keeping university fair and accessible, defending the CSIRO and research funding and fighting ABC/SBS cuts make it more important than ever to have a strong opposition,' she said.

'I am heartened that we have a Federal Labor Leader of the calibre of Bill Shorten and caucus of great depth and substance to take up this fight.'

Senator Lundy told the Canberra Times that she plans to work in a technology role.
