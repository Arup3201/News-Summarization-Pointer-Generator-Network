The Louis van Gaal era at Manchester United looks to have started already as the diggers moved into the club’s Carrington training complex.

The Dutchman spoke to the media on Thursday for the first time since being appointed as Manchester United boss and described facilities as 'fantastic' but said something must be done about how windy it gets.

'The (training ground) needs some more intimacy and I have asked (for that) already,' Van Gaal explained.

‘Because now it is an open field and 
there is always wind and wind is not always the friend of the players 
and the football. So we have to do something about that. But the 
facilities are fantastic.’

And
 it seems the work is could already be underway as diggers arrived on 
Friday morning and could get to work on making the changes Van Gaal 
required.

Sir Alex Ferguson 
ensured major changes were made to United's training facilities towards 
the end of the nineties, fearing that they would be inadequate for a 
team looking to dominate the Premier League in the 21st century.

Construction
 work began to upgrade Carrington in 1999, with £22million spent before 
the facilities were opened in the summer of 2000, replacing United’s old
 training ground, The Cliff. Another £8m was spent on the Academy 
Facility, which opened two years later.

And
 in 2013, a medical and sports science facility worth £25m was unveiled,
 taking the club's spending on the overall complex to more than £60m.

Ferguson described the enhanced training headquarters as his 'best signing' and well worth the investment from the club.

'It's
 given us a training facility where all the players are saying, 'Wow, 
this is some training ground now'. It's one of the best. And I think if 
any player were to come here with any doubts about where they should be,
 they'll soon find out that this is a fantastic set-up.'

Straight ahead: Van Gaal said he is proud to be in charge of a club like Manchester United

Van Gaal took time to praise the sense of community he has found since arriving in Manchester on Wednesday.

‘It’s unbelievable how many people are working for the same cause,' he said.

‘It’s also a family and everybody is proud to work for Manchester United.

‘That feeling I have is fantastic.'

The
 former Bayern Munich boss said he was pleased United's season tickets 
had already sold out ahead of the start of the 2014-15 Premier League 
season.

‘I have heard that the season-tickets are already sold out and I am very proud.

‘I hope you support us when we are losing and not only winning, because we will win and lose together.’
