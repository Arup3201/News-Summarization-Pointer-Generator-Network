Dan Grabiner, 24, married Lucy Barber, 38, after the pair met at one London's most prestigious schools

A female teacher at one of London's prestigious schools resigned after meeting a male pupil and went on to marry him.

Geography teacher Lucy Barber left the £22,000-a-year St Paul's School in Barnes, West London, after meeting Daniel Grabiner, who is 14 years her junior.

He is also the son of top barrister Lord Grabiner QC, who is head of One Essex Court Chambers in London.

The pair are now are now living in a semi-detached house worth £1.4million in London and have a child together. 

Mr Grabiner went on to study at Magdalene College, Cambridge, while Mrs Barber is said to have been employed at another school.

A former pupil of the school told the Daily Mail: 'When we heard that they were officially together it was quite a scandal as she was a teacher and so much older.'

'It was a bit of a shock for the family at first, but they've got used to it since Dan and Lucy married and had a baby,' a friend of the family said.

A spokesman for St Paul's confirmed the pair are now married.

They added: 'The pupil left in 2007 and the teacher resigned in 2008 to do a drama course. We are unaware of any allegations being raised at this time.'

Chancellor of the Exchequer George 
Osborne is among the former pupils of St Paul's, which was established 
in 1509 and is considered one of the leading schools in the country.

According to its website, fees are 
£10,411 for a term of boarding and £6,951 per term of days. An Ofsted 
inspection in March 2013 described quality of learning at the school as 
'exceptional'.

Daniel's father, Lord Grabiner QC, who was involved in the sale of Liverpool Football Club, is the head of the prestigious One Essex Court chambers in London

Mr Grabiner, who now works as a 
production developer for ITV, told Mail Online he did not have any 
comment to make about the story.

The revelation comes after a deputy head at a leading private girls’ school has been 
forced to resign because of an affair with a former pupil.

Phil
 Culling, 41, became romantically involved with 19-year-old Helena 
Skelly, an aspiring singer who left Godolphin and Latymer school last 
summer.

Parents received an email from Headmistress Ruth 
Mercer informing them Mr Culling had ‘resigned his position as deputy 
head with immediate effect’ because his role had become ‘untenable’.

St Paul’s and its junior division, Colet Court has recently been mired by a historic child abuse scandal.

The Metropolitan Police began looking into claims after a number of pupils from the 1960s and 1980s came forward with new information.

The allegations were apparently focused on accusations from a number of former pupils that eight former schoolmasters sexually abused dozens of young boys between the mid-1960s and last year.

The victims are thought to have been aged between nine and 17, and were abused in dormitories, classrooms, a swimming pool, inside a car, and at a teachers' homes.

Classics teacher Anthony Fuggle, 57, resigned his post after he was arrested and bailed on suspicion of possession of indecent images.

In February, former St Paul’s master Patrick Marshall, 65, was arrested on suspicion of indecently assaulting a pupil in the 1970s. He denies any wrongdoing.

The pair met at the £22,000-a-year St Paul's School in Barnes, West London. Mr Grabiner is 14 years her junior

St Paul's, which looks across the Thames, boasts a number of
alumni who have gone into positions of prominence.

Poet John Milton, who wrote Paradise Lost, was one of the first pupils of note to attend the London school.

Samuel Pepys, a naval administrator famous for the diary he kept
between 1660 and 1669, was educated there in the mid-17th century.

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne was a pupil
before going on to study at Magdalen College, Oxford.

Ed Vaizey, the Tory Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, is also a former pupil.

Actor Rory Kinnear, who starred in Skyfall and Quantum of Solace,
Professor Robert Winston and TV presenter Dan Snow also attended the
prestigious institution.
