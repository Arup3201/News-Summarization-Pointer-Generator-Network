Roy Hodgson has called Arsenal defender Calum Chambers up to the England squad after John Stones withdrew because of an ankle injury he suffered in Everton's 2-1 defeat at Manchester United.

Stones is set for a spell on the sidelines because of suspected ankle ligament damage, which occurred in the dying minutes of Sunday's game at Old Trafford.

As a result, the Everton centre-back will not report for England duty on Monday ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.

The Football Association (FA) confirmed on Sunday night that Chambers has been drafted into the senior squad from the Under-21s to replace the former Barnsley defender.

A statement from the FA read: 'Following John Stones' injury this afternoon the player will not report to St George's Park for England duty tomorrow.

'England manager Roy Hodgson has subsequently called up Calum Chambers, who was previously due to report for the Under 21s team.'

Stones' injury is a blow to Hodgson, who handed the Everton centre-back his first competitive England start last month against Switzerland.

Although San Marino and Estonia are among the weakest footballing nations in Europe, the England boss would have viewed the upcoming double-header as a perfect opportunity for the young defender to gain more international experience.

Hodgson is already without injured defenders Kyle Walker, Glen Johnson, Jon Flanagan, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones for the games, which take place on Thursday and Sunday respectively.

Stones, who left Old Trafford on crutches with a protective boot on his left leg, will be out of action for some time, according to the club.

A post on Everton's Twitter feed read: 'Martinez confirms Stones has injured his ankle ligaments and will be assessed over the next 48 hours.'

Everton boss Roberto Martinez then said in his press conference: 'John Stones has a problem with his ankle. It will be at least a few weeks (until he recovers).

'I don't expect John to be fit for next week.

'It is such a massive blow because he plays with an incredible arrogance. We will assess him in the next 48 hours.'

Chambers received his first senior call-up for the double-header against Norway and Switzerland last month.

The teenage defender was originally selected for the Under-21 squad this time around as they have an important play-off against Croatia, but Hodgson feels he needs the player for next week's senior games instead.

Chambers' former Saints team-mate Luke Shaw will report for Under-21 action even though he hobbled off in the second half of United's victory on Sunday.

The 19-year-old, who has three senior caps, received a kick to the knee during the match at Old Trafford, but he feels fit enough to join up with the Young Lions.

Shaw said: 'It's not a bad injury - it's a dead leg on my knee.

Chambers made his England debut in the friendly against Norway at Wembley last month

'I felt it in the first 20 minutes when I got caught, but it carried on during the game so I thought it was probably best to come off before it gets any worse.

'I spoke with the doctor and obviously the manager as well, and both feel it's best that I do go [with England Under-21s] as it's not an injury that is going to keep me out.

'Hopefully, I should be training in the next couple of days and can get another two games of 90 minutes.'
