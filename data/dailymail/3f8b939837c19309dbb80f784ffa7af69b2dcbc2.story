A lost squadron of Spitfires that has been buried in the Burmese jungle since the end of the Second World War is to be dug up and brought back to Britain.

Aircraft enthusiast David Cundall spent 15 years and £130,000 of his own money tracking down the aircraft.

Up to 60 planes were buried in transport crates at a secret location 40ft below ground at the end of the war to ensure they didn’t fall into enemy hands.

David Cundall, from North Lincolnshire, discovered 20 Spitfires buried in crates in Burma - and they will now be excavated for display

Saved for posterity: At least 60 Spitfires are believed to be buried - and they will hopefully be proudly displayed once again thanks to the 16-year hunt

The Spitfires are believed to be in good
condition because they were waxed, wrapped in greased paper and had 
their joints tarred by RAF crews.

The excavation is due to start at the end of the month after an agreement was signed with the military regime in Rangoon.

Mr Cundall, 62, a farmer from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, started his 
treasure hunt in 1996 after hearing a throwaway remark from a group of 
US veterans who said they once buried Spitfires in Burma.

The fighter planes – of which there are only around 35 left flying in 
the world – were shipped to Burma and transported by rail to a British 
RAF base in August 1945.

But they were deemed surplus to requirements and unsuited to the 
‘island-hopping’ missions to clear the Japanese of their remaining 
strongholds in the Pacific.

Mr Cundall tracked down an eyewitness who led him to the area where the aircraft were buried.
He eventually located the buried planes using ground-penetrating radar equipment.

His team dug a borehole and sent down a camera to look at the crates, which were said to be in ‘really good condition’.

Images showed the Spitfires inside the containers with their wings packed alongside them.

The planes will now be dug up and brought back to the UK to be 
reassembled. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We hope that many of them
will soon be gracing the skies of Britain.’

The deal went ahead after Prime 
Minister David Cameron signed a heritage agreement with Burmese 
President Thein Sein during his visit to the south-east Asian nation in 
April.

The excavation agreement was signed on
Tuesday by Mr Cundall, Burma's civil aviation chief Tin Naing Tun and 
the Shwe Taung Paw company boss Htoo Htoo Zaw, Mr Cundall's partner in 
the country

Mr Zaw said: 'This will be the largest number of Spitfires in the world. We want to let people see those historic fighters.'

Mr Cundall's treasure hunt was sparked
in 1996 by a throwaway remark from a group of U.S. veterans who said 
they had once buried Spitfires in the Burmese jungle.

The Spitfires, of which there are only
around 35 flying left in the world, were shipped to Burma and 
transported by rail to the British RAF base in August 1945.

Mr Cundall, from Scunthorpe, 
Lincolnshire, persuaded the country's notoriously secretive regime to 
allow him to search for the lost aircraft, winning their trust over 12 
visits.

pieced together their possible location by speaking to the declining 
number of Far East veterans

He said at the time: 'I’m only a small
farmer, I’m not a multi-millionaire and it has been a struggle. It took
me more than 15 years but I finally found them.

'Spitfires are beautiful aeroplanes 
and should not be rotting away in a foreign land. They saved our neck in
the Battle of Britain and they should be preserved.'

Permission to excavate the planes was granted because of the strengthening relations between London and Rangoon.

In the past year, Burma has turned 
away from the repressive policies of the previous military regime and 
has taken a reforming democratic stance.

A Downing Street spokesman said: 'We 
hope that many of them will be gracing the skies of Britain and as 
discussed, some will be displayed here in Burma.'

Mr Cundall said the government had promised him it would not be making a claim for the aircraft.

A law passed by the British when they 
granted Burma independence in 1948 meant that anything left behind 
automatically became the property of the Burmese government.

Mr Cundall is understood to have struck a deal with the Burmese president to take 60 per cent of the profits.
