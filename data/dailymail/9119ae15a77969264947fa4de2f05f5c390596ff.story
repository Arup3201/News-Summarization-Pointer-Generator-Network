Former Liverpool defender Steve Nicol is adamant that the Reds will beat arch-rivals Manchester United to a Champions League qualification spot come the end of the season.

The Merseysiders are just one place and two points behind United, who currently occupy fourth, with 10 Premier League games remaining.

Brendan Rodgers' side are the form team in England's top flight having collected 29 points from their last 11 matches - having bounced back after making a poor start this season.

United too have strung together a decent run of results with Ashley Young's late winner against Newcastle on Wednesday night ensuring that Louis van Gaal's side keep Liverpool at bay in their top-four battle.

The two sides meet at Anfield on March 22 and Nicol believes Liverpool's momentum means it's only a matter of time before they overtake United in the table.

'Man United got themselves into a great position but at this stage of the season it is all about momentum,' he told talkSPORT's Extra Time show.

'You can't argue that Man United are picking up points. But Liverpool at the moment don't care who is put in front of them - they just go about their business.

'The good Liverpool teams of the past have all been about good passing and good movement and this team's passing is accurate, the movement is fantastic, and they are giving anybody that is put in front of them a headache. If they keep playing the way they are, who is going to beat them?

And the 53-year-old feels Liverpool could finish higher than fourth and even challenge for third place with Arsenal.

'If Liverpool continue to steamroll teams, they even have a chance of third place,' he added.

'I think Arsenal are guaranteed [to finish in the top four]. It is Arsenal and Liverpool for third and fourth.'
