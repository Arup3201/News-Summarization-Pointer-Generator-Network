England's cricket calamity has sharpened the minds of their rugby counterparts, who know they are next in line to carry the nation's hopes into a World Cup.

Events in Australia on Monday registered strongly at the Red Rose HQ in Surrey — serving to highlight the pressure that will come with the global tournament on these shores later this year. 

While there are still two rounds of RBS 6 Nations matches to go, Stuart Lancaster is mindful of September's showpiece.

The England rugby coach said there was more expectation from the nation after the poor showing in Adelaide

'It's hugely disappointing to see the cricket guys go out and you understand the expectation and the stakes,' said the head coach. 

'I have a massive game on Saturday and another one the following Saturday, but you can't help thinking ahead to what September is going to look and feel like. With it being in our own country, the pressure and expectation is going to be huge.'

Asked if he empathised with England cricket coach Peter Moores, who faces a fight to save his job, Lancaster said: 'I've met him a couple of times but we haven't spoken recently. 

'Any coach can empathise with another from their country who has had a difficult World Cup. It reinforces the need for us to be as prepared as we can be for our big challenge in six months.'
