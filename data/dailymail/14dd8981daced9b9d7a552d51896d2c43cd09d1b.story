Moeen Ali provided a one-man retort to criticism of England’s selection policy with a 21-ball half-century as the tourists completed a facile victory over Sri Lanka A in Colombo.

With Alex Hales left out of England’s tour opener at the Sinhalese Sports Club, the coach/captain axis of Peter Moores and Alastair Cook appeared to have provided fresh ammunition to those who feel their top-order batting in one-day cricket is too pedestrian to challenge the world’s best.

Instead, Ali hammered all six legitimate deliveries of seamer Vishwa Fernando’s second over for four on his way to a 37-ball 56. Since Cook himself made 54 off 58 deliveries, the big-hitting Hales was hardly missed at all.

Not all the Sri Lankan bowling was of the highest quality, but that is to take nothing away from the cleanliness of Ali’s strokeplay.

Chasing 199 in 43 overs, England began their innings with Cook playing out a maiden. Then came Ali. Four times in the next over he deposited Fernando through or over extra cover; once he produced a lovely on-drive; and he rounded things off with a flick off his legs. Throw in a leg-side wide, and the over cost 25. Ali was up and running.

His fifty came up in the grand style, courtesy of a six launched over long-on off the off-spin of Ramith Rambukwalla which pierced a hole in an advertising banner on the top tier of the stand. If he slowed down after that, then he had proved his point: on slow Asian pitches, Ali has the game to succeed.

Captain Alastair Cook was also amongst the runs as the opener hit a composed half century to match Ali

Cook had his moments, too – especially when he was late-cutting the spinners. One slog-sweep for six was a reminder that rope-clearing is not just something other opening batsmen do. Together, the pair added 94 in 13.1 overs. Tougher challenges lie in wait, but this was a good start.

Bad light stopped play after 25 overs, with England cruising at 145 for 2, and Ian Bell and Joe Root enjoying a gentle net. When the umpires decided to call it a day, the tourists led by 56 runs on Duckworth/Lewis.

Earlier Ali had taken three wickets as England restricted Sri Lanka A to 198 for 6 in their 43 overs, after drizzle had delayed the start for an hour. With Cook’s team looking for the best way to balance their attack in spin-friendly conditions, this contribution was almost as significant as his tearaway half-century.

Ali struck twice in his third over, first persuading Niroshan Dickwella to top-edge a sweep to a diving James Tredwell at short fine leg, then having Sri Lanka’s former Twenty20 captain Dinesh Chandimal caught at leg slip by Cook second ball.

That left the Sri Lankans 49 for 3 after they had batted first, and Ali had a hand in the next two wickets as well – though not before Kusal Perera and Ashan Priyanjan had put on 55 for the fourth wicket.

The dangerous Perera uppercut Steven Finn to third man, where Ali clung on, before Ali removed Thilina Kandamby in the next over, playing too soon and driving straight to Eoin Morgan at short extra cover.

It had been a mixed bag from England’s bowlers. Chris Woakes looked sharp during an opening burst of six over for eight runs, while Finn produced a beauty to get rid of Kaushal Silva in the game’s third over, but also sent down four wides.

In that, he was hardly alone. Woakes also bowled four wides, as did the erratic Chris Jordan, whose five overs leaked 48 and who looks an increasingly luxury in this one-day side. Tredwell was tidy, and three lively overs from Ben Stokes produced the wicket of Priyanjan, caught behind by Jos Buttler.

England will also be disappointed that they failed to finish Sri Lanka A off after reducing them to 122 for 6.

But, with only two warm-up games scheduled before Wednesday’s first one-day international in Colombo, Cook’s side would have settled for this. And, for the time being, they have quietened the debate about their top order.
