The brother-in-law of murdered hostage Alan Henning rounded on the Government yesterday, saying they could have done more to save the aid worker.

Colin Livesey said he was ‘angry’ with Ministers for failing to take more action to secure the release of the father of two when they knew about his capture ‘months and months ago’.

He was speaking after international condemnation of a video released on Friday night that showed the taxi driver from Manchester had been beheaded by a man believed to be British extremist Jihadi John.

Alan Henning was captured by the group on Boxing Day last year as he delivered aid to Syrian refugees

Mr Livesey's anger came as David Cameron, the prime minister, ordered spy chiefs to find the militants killing international hostages so special forces soldiers can go in to either capture or kill them.

Just 12 hours after the video was published all but showing the beheading of Mr Henning, Mr Cameron summoned the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ to his country retreat, Chequers, where he instructed them to track down the Islamic State executioners.

Intelligence chiefs have reportedly already supplied the government with information about the militant unit which is holding the remaining hostages, among them British photojournalist John Cantlie. But the Sunday Times reports that the intelligence assessments are not detailed enough for a special forces raid because the group is constantly on the move around the desert. 

The Prime Minister was said to have told special forces chiefs he wants the militants captured dead or alive.

Mr Cameron said after the briefing: 'The murder of Alan Henning was absolutely appalling. It is senseless; it's completely unforgivable. Anyone in any doubt about this organisation can now see how truly repulsive it is and barbaric it is as an organisation.

'What we see with this organisation is that there is no level of depravity to which they will not sink. The fact that this was a kind, gentle, compassionate and caring man who had simply gone to help others, the fact they could murder him in the way they did shows what we are dealing with.

'We must do everything we can to defeat this organisation. We must take action against it and we must find those responsible.'

Mr Livesey, 47, the brother of Mr Henning’s widow Barbara, denounced the Islamic State militants as ‘scum’ and said he prayed they ‘get what’s coming to them’.

He said: ‘There was just no need. For a person who went there to give aid, to help their kids, their people in Syria, and for them to do what they have done, there is just no sense in it at all. There are no words in the dictionary to describe how I feel towards them. I’ve just got so much hatred for them.’

His accusations were echoed by Majid Freeman, 26, a friend of Mr Henning who was on the aid convoy in December when the 47-year-old was seized.

He said: ‘The Government did nothing to help him. They should have secured his release but instead they abandoned him and left him out there.’ 

Last night, the parents of the latest American hostage threatened with murder, Peter Kassig, issued an emotional video appeal to his IS captors to ‘show mercy’.

His schoolteacher father, Ed Kassig, and mother, Paula, said that the 26-year-old former soldier converted to Islam after he disappeared in October 2013 in Syria, where he was delivering food and medical supplies to casualties of the civil war. 

Mr Kassig said: ‘We implore his captors to show mercy and use their power to let our son go.’

Colin Livesey, pictured, described his brother-in-law Alan Henning's killers as 'scum', adding: 'I just hope and pray they get what's coming to them' 

 In a statement issued by the Foreign Office, Barbara Henning said her family and friends were ‘devastated’ after receiving the ‘news we hoped we would never hear’.

Alan Henning: 'I am Alan Henning. Because of our parliament’s decision to attack the Islamic state I as a member of the British public will now pay the price for that decision.'

Jihadi John: 'The blood of David Haines was on your hands Cameron, Alan Henning will also be slaughtered but his blood is on the hands of the British parliament.'

Jihadi John then steps forward to cut Mr Henning's throat and his body is shown lying on the floor.

Peter Kassig is then shown kneeling next to Jihadi John. 

Jihadi John: 'Obama you have started your aerial bombardment in Sham (Syria) which keeps on striking our people, so it’s only right we continue to strike the necks of your people.'

Mrs Henning, who had issued a series of emotional appeals for her husband’s release over recent days, said she, her son Adam, 15, and daughter Lucy, 17, were ‘numb with grief’.

‘We always knew that Alan was in the most dangerous of situations, but we hoped that he would return home to us. That is not to be,’ Mrs Henning said.

She added that her husband was a ‘decent, caring human being’ of whom she and her family were ‘extremely proud’.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that an Islamic campaign group linked to former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg was at the centre of increasingly frantic efforts to free Mr Henning over recent weeks.

The London-based Cage UK, of which Mr Begg is a director, tried to persuade the jihadis that it would be un-Islamic to murder an aid worker.

Mr Begg, 45, was released from Belmarsh prison on Wednesday after terrorism charges against him were dropped.

David Cameron vowed yesterday to use all available means to hunt down those responsible for the beheading. 

There were hopes that Mr Henning, right, could be freed after a sharia court set up by Islamic State to investigate claims he was a spy found him innocent

The Prime Minister said: ‘We will use all the assets we have to try to help those hostages… and defeat this organisation which is utterly ruthless and barbaric.

‘There is no level of depravity to which they will not sink. No appeals made any difference.’

Lord Dannatt, a former Chief of the General Staff, said his heart went out to Mr Henning’s family and friends but said it was ‘quite harsh’ to blame the Government.

He said: ‘We don’t know what our Government has and hasn’t been doing. But I think we are all united in the fact that the so-called Islamic State and these fighters are an abomination and they have got to be confronted.’

Mr Henning was the fourth Westerner and second Briton – after fellow aid worker David Haines – to be murdered.

As before, the video depicted Mr Henning, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, kneeling alongside his black-clad, masked killer. 

In the recording he recited: ‘Because of our Parliament’s decision to attack the Islamic State, I, as a member of the British public, will now pay the price for that decision.’ 

Muslim leaders had appealed to ISIS over the threat to kill Mr Henning, who was working for an Islamic aid organisation, saying it went against the religion
