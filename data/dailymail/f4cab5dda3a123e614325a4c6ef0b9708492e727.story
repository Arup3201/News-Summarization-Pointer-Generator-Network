A bullying boyfriend was jailed today for attacking an heroic soldier who saved his girlfriend from drowning.

Army Captain Mark Gold, 43, was strolling along the River Taff in Cardiff city centre when he saw Martin Edwards, 43, pushing girlfriend Leanne Ware, 31, into the freezing water.

Captain Gold rang 999 and rushed into the water to drag Miss Ware’s lifeless body from the swollen river in February.

But he was punched by raging Edwards as he dragged her limp body to safety.

A court heard Edwards lashed out and screamed at the soldier: 'F**k off, leave her alone, she’s my girlfriend. I’ll sort her out.'

Captain Gold fought off the attack and pulled unconscious Miss Ware to the river bank.

He then brought her back from the dead by performing CPR.

Prosecutor John Philpotts said Miss Ware was face down in the fast flowing river for around three minutes before Army medic Captain Gold managed to reach her lifeless body on the riverbank.

Mr Philpotts told Cardiff Crown Court: 'Edwards told Captain Gold to “f**k off” and was flailing his arms about.

'Captain Gold managed to pull Miss Ware’s head out of the water but took a blow to his face for the trouble from Edwards.

'By now Miss Ware had been in the water for sometime. She was blue and appeared to be unresponsive.

'Captain Gold shouted at Edwards to release Miss Ware and told him she was dead because that is how it appeared to him.

'Edwards stopped behaving aggressively at that point. Maybe he realised what he was doing.'

The court heard Miss Ware was effectively dead and was at the lowest level a human can possibly be on the Glasgow Coma Scale.

Captain Gold told the court: 'She was blue, not moving and had no pulse. She was dead.

'She had been under the water for close to three minutes and there were no signs of life.'

But Captain Gold, who has served in the Royal Army Medical Corps for 21 years, began CPR on her lifeless body in a vain attempt to bring her back from the dead.

With the help of a passing doctor who performed mouth-to-mouth they miraculously managed to revive her.

Paramedics eventually arrived and rushed Miss Ware to hospital where she made a full recovery.

Captain Gold identified Edwards to police officers at the scene and they arrested him after the attack.

Edwards, of Butetown, Cardiff, was cleared by a jury of attempted murder but was found guilty of unlawfully inflicting grievous bodily harm on Miss Ware and assaulting Captain Gold.

He was sentenced to three and a half years in jail for GBH and seven days for the assault on Captain Gold.
