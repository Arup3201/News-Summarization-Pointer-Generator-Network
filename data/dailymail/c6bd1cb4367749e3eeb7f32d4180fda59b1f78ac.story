She managed to upstage one of world's most-watched weddings in 2011 by wearing a very flattering dress - and now Pippa Middleton has cheekily joked that her bridesmaid gown may have fitted 'a little too well'.

The 30-year-old revealed how the dress she wore to her sister Kate's wedding to Prince William in 2011 transformed her life, during her first public speech.

At a dinner held by the Women in Advertising and Communications London group at the Savoy Hotel, she talked to guests about how her life had changed irrevocably since the Royal Wedding.

As Maid of Honour Pippa Middleton almost stole the show in that figure hugging dress

Referring to the headlines about her figure-hugging dress, she joked: 'As I have found out, recognition has its upside, its downside and - you may say - its backside.'

Wearing a £1,000 black Catherine Deane ‘Simone’ lace panel jersey evening gown Pippa, who was accompanied by her mother Carole for moral support, the socialite was not paid for her appearance.

A guest told the Daily Mirror: 'It was unbelievable how open she was - I don't think anyone was expecting that.

'She came across as really grateful for the opportunities but also talked about the pitfalls of her position'.

Her new role as a public speaker comes just days after the aspiring author was quietly dropped by her American publisher, Viking Press, after selling just 18,000 copies of her cult party planning book Celebrate.

She candidly opened up in front of guests about how 'difficult' it had been experiencing the negative response to her book

But she candidly opened up in front of guests about how 'difficult' it had been experiencing the negative response to her book - which was criticised for offering simple advice about how to host social occasions.

Now the Duchess of Cambridge's sister has turned to former Independent editor Simon Kelner’s PR outfit, Seven Dials, to seek some public relations advice.

The firm boasts the Queen’s former communications secretary, Simon Walker as non-executive director.

Clients include the Queen’s grocer Fortnum & Mason, Global Radio and NJOY electronic cigarettes. Mr Kelner was present when Pippa gave her first public speech on Monday night.
