The father of Jeremy Forrest has collapsed and was then taken to hospital as the jury in his son's abduction case was about to start considering its verdict.

An ambulance was called to Lewes Crown Court this morning when Jim Forrest fell ill in its waiting room.

He has spent more than a week in the public gallery with his wife Julie, Forrest's mother, and daughter Carrie, Forrest's older sister.Â 

His son, 30, is accused of abducting a schoolgirl and going on the run in France for eight days. Forrest denies the charge.

Trial: As Jeremy Forrest's trial came towards its end today, his father Jim (right, today) has collapsed at court

Aid: Jim Forrest is helped into an ambulance outside Lewes Crown Court, East Sussex after he collapsed

Swept away: The ambulance then left quickly for the local hospital with Mr Forrest safely inside

His trial at Lewes Crown Court has heard that the pupil was 15 when she started a sexual relationship with Forrest after developing a crush on him at Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne, East Sussex.

Fearing they were about to be exposed, Forrest booked them on a cross-Channel ferry from Dover to Calais on September 20 before spending seven days on the run in France.

Richard Barton, prosecuting, said Forrest's actions were an abuse of trust and he had not acted with the consent of the girl's parents.

Case: Jim Forrest looked well when he arrived at Lewes Crown Court (pictured) today, but collapsed shortly afterwards

He added that Forrest could be labelled a paedophile who groomed the vulnerable teenager.

Ronald Jaffa, defending, said the teenager was 'desperate and suicidal' and Forrest went with her to prevent her coming to harm.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
