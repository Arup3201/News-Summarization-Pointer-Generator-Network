The uncle of the deceased Boston Marathon bombing suspect can claim his body now that his widow has agreed to release it - but other members of the family risk arrest if they try to claim it.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body has been at the medical examiner's office in Massachusetts since he died after a gunfight with authorities more than a week ago.

Amato DeLuca, the Rhode Island attorney for his widow, Katherine Russell, said in a statement that his client had just learned that the medical examiner was ready to release Tsarnaev's body and that she wants it released to the Tsarnaev family.

Relatives of the deceased Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev will claim his body now that his widow, Katherine Russell, has agreed to release it

Should Tsarnaev's mother decide to travel to the U.S. to claim her son's remains, there is a possibility she could be risking arrest.

FBI agents have confirmed Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is considered a 'person of interest' in their investigations.

Detectives said they were looking into the possibility she may have helped to 'radicalize her son, or had contacts with other people or other terrorist groups'.

Widow: Katherine Russell, seen left in a school picture and right leaving the home she had shared with Tsarnaev the day after he was killed, is co-operating with the investigation, detectives said

Police said Tsarnaev ran out of ammunition before his brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, dragged his body under a vehicle while fleeing the scene.Â 

His cause of death has been determined but will not be made public until his remains are claimed.

'Of course, family members will take possession of the body,' uncle Ruslan Tsarni of Montgomery Village, Md., said on Tuesday night.

'We'll do it. We will do it. A family is a family.'

He would not elaborate. Tsarnaev's parents are still in Russia, but he has other relatives on his side of the family in the U.S., including Tsarni.

Visit: The home of Katherine Russell's parents in North Kingstown, widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev. FBI agents visited the home Monday, April 29, 2013, and carried away several bags

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev lies in a prison hospital after being wounded in the shootout with police as he and his brother made their getaway attempt.

He is charged with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill, a crime that carries a potential death sentence.

DeLuca said Tamerlan Tsarnaev's widow met with law enforcement 'for many hours over the past week' and will continue cooperating.

FBI agents on Monday visited her 
parents' North Kingstown, R.I., home, where she has been staying, and 
carried away several bags.

Until
Tuesday's statement, DeLuca had declined to provide any details about 
Russell's contact with authorities, except to say that Russell was doing
everything she could to assist with the investigation.

In
addition to declining to claim the body herself, which is her right as 
his spouse, Russell has taken other steps to distance herself from 
Tsarnaev since taking refuge at her family's home on April 19, hours 
after her husband was killed.

Her
family released a statement shortly after she was escorted home by 
federal agents that day saying they 'never really knew' Tsarnaev.

Russell has also reverted to using her maiden name instead of the name listed on her marriage certificate, Tsarnaeva.

On Tuesday, DeLuca said Russell mourned the loss of life from the bombings.

'Katherine and her family continue to be deeply saddened by the harm that has been caused,' DeLuca said.

Terrel
Harris, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, said Tuesday 
evening that the state had not yet received Russell's request to release
her husband's body.

He
said arrangements must be made to release the body and once that 
happens a death certificate will be filed and the cause of death made 
public.

He said it is too soon to speculate on when that might happen.
