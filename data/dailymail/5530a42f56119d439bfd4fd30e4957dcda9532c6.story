Some people celebrate the big 4-0 with a big party and others book a thrill-seeking experience like a bungee jump.  

Melinda Bird is determined to mark forty years on this planet by falling in love. 

The milestone is already an enormous achievement for the devout Mormon from Utah - after she was born with a rare condition called sacral agenesis, doctors predicted that she wouldn't make it past her first birthday.

Melinda Bird, 40, from Utah was born with a rare condition called sacral agenesis, which caused her spine to stop growing at the bottom of her rib cage. Doctors told her parents that she wouldn't live past the age of one, but she is now celebrating her 40th birthday

Sacral agenesis is a rare condition that caused Melissa's spine to stop growing at the bottom of her rib cage, leaving the lower part of her body compressed.

Doctors predicted she would never sit up or talk, but now 40-year-old Melinda counts quad biking, boating, surfing and shooting among her hobbies.

And recently she embarked on her most daunting venture yet when she joined the dating scene.

The government admin worker, from Utah, has never been kissed - and hadn't been on a date in twenty years.

But now she is taking the Mormon-dating scene by storm in her quest to find love.

Doctors predicted that Melinda would never sit up or talk, but she defied the odds and now leads a very active lifestyle

Melinda - who walks on her hands and uses a wheelchair - said: 'My condition means my top half is normal, even though my bottom half stopped growing.

'But I've never let my disability get in the way of enjoying life. I love being active and have a great group of friends.

'The one thing missing in my life is a boyfriend. I'd like to find somebody and fall in love.

'I also think I'm judged for my disability. People assume they'll have to look after me, they don't realise how independent I am.'

Melinda's faith also means she is keen to settle down as she can feel like an outcast in the Mormon community because of her single status.

But while she is physically capable of having children, she fears that her biological clock is ticking and she is keen to have a family or adopt.

Melinda said: 'I was raised in the church so the church is very important to me. It's a big part of my life. 

'In a way, you kind of feel left out a little bit if you're not married.

'There has to be a guy out there for me.'

Melinda enjoys a range of thrill-seeking hobbies, including quadbiking

Melinda loves to be outdoors and most of her hobbies are tailored around sport 

Melinda grew up with her mum Carol, dad Pat and older brother Monty, now 44.

She said: 'My parents didn't know I had sacral agenesis before I was born.

'My mum always told me knew something was wrong because the pregnancy was different from when she carried my brother - he moved around a lot more.'

Carol and Pat's excitement at the birth gave way to despair when they were told that their baby had the condition - which affects one in 25,000 births - and wouldn't live to be a toddler.

But despite the grim prognosis, Melinda exceeded all expectations.

She said: 'By the age of three I started shuffling around on my bum to get around, then I learnt to walk on my hands.

'Doctors offered me prosthetic legs, but I didn't want them, I preferred walking on my hands.'

Melinda enjoyed an active childhood with brother Monty and never noticed any differences between them in terms of what they could do.

And as she grew older, she refused to let her disability hold her back, learning to drive and living independently. 

But Melinda never met that special someone and after the death of her parents in recent years, she started to consider her life and what it meant to be alone.

She said: 'I feel like my life is very full. I have a wonderful family that's very supportive, friends, I have a nice home and I live in a beautiful area.

'I think the one big thing that's missing in my life is just that special guy.

'I would like to find somebody and fall in love.'

Melinda started her search by uploading a profile to a dating website, but her quest for Mr Right proved more difficult than she anticipated.

She said: 'I think I'm attractive to the opposite sex, I've had people tell me I'm beautiful. Does that translate into wanting to date? No.'

Melinda was disappointed that she received no hits on her dating profile but, undeterred, she enlisted the help of Mormon dating professionals.

She said: 'I thought maybe there was some areas I needed to improve on in myself and they can do that for me.

'I really think they'll be able to help me find the best me.'

Firstly, the matchmakers sent Melinda for a makeover to improve her confidence and catch the eye of a potential suitor.

And after a shopping spree, a facial, a new hairstyle and new make-up, Melinda was raring to go on the first date arranged by the matchmakers.

A string of other dates followed, including a horse and cart ride, a trip to the aquarium, romantic dinners and even an indoor skydiving session.

Melinda even appeared on local TV to appeal for men to take her out and travelled 800 miles to a Mormon dating convention in California.

And although she still hasn't found that someone special, Melinda is starting to find her stride.

She said: 'I think I've got better at dating. I still have my profile online and I've gotten more hits of late. I haven't given up hope that someday it will happen.

'I'm romantic, I want to give all of myself to someone. There has got to be somebody out there for me.'

Mormon Half Love is on Wednesday February 4, 10pm on TLC.
