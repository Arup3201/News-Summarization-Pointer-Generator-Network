We are down to the
final two and this most enthralling of World Cups will climax with either
Germany or Argentina crowned champion.

They are both
worthy victors, Germany having coupled fortitude with flair on their march to the
final while Argentina have proved resilient and resourceful during their
passage.

But who will come
out on top? Here, Sportsmail examines the likely starting XIs and determines
who has the pick of the players on display…

GOALKEEPER

Manuel Neuer   

The Bayern Wall is a solid foundation upon which to build a team and he has been an impassable presence in Brazil. The world’s number one No1 has proved his standing as thus at the finals and – like Dino Zoff, Gianluigi Buffon and Iker Casillas – is deserving of a World Cup winner’s medal.

Not getting past: Manuel Neuer has been one of the outstanding goalkeepers of the competition

Sergio Romero  

To
 his credit, Romero has ignored – and subsequently silenced - the 
naysayers who deemed him the weak link after a season of inactivity at 
Monaco. He was the star in the penalty-shootout victory over Holland and
 will have to produce similar heroics if Argentina are to triumph.

VERDICT:
 Neuer is the best there is when it comes to the goalkeeping trade and 
Romero, despite impressing, doesn’t come close to the German.

Between the sticks: Romero's penalty heroics helped Argentina through to the final

RIGHT BACK

Philipp Lahm  

Even from full-back he is able to influence affairs with his intelligence and ability to keep the ball and is rarely shown up on a defensive front either.         

Switching up: Philipp Lahm was moved from midfield back to full-back by manager Joachim Low

Pablo Zabaleta

Combative
 and energetic, Zabaleta is very much the modern full-back with a 
healthy dose of old-school cynicism thrown in. He is dependable and a 
leader.

VERDICT: Perhaps the toughest call on the park but Zabaleta shades it on his energy and aggression.

Trusted: Man City defender Zabaleta has had a fantastic tournament at right-back for Argentina

CENTRE BACK

Mats Hummels    

He’s on the shortlist for FIFA’s Golden Ball prize and that serves to highlight his assured and classy presence at the heart of the German backline. Scored the winner in the quarter-final defeat of France.

Handy: Hummels scored the only goal against France in the quarters and was in fine form against Brazil

Ezequiel Garay          

The
 Benfica stopper marries grit and grizzle to his ability to play and few
 forwards at these finals have enjoyed coming up against him.

VERDICT:
 Another one which could go either way but Hummels is one cool customer 
and boasts latter-stage Champions League experience with Dortmund.

Other end: Ezequiel Garay scores a penalty for Argentina in the semi-final win over Holland

CENTRE-BACK   

Jerome Boateng      

He has grown into the tournament and, given his ease in possession, fits well into the German model.

Versatile: Boateng fends off a challenge from Olivier Giroud in the quarter-final victory

Martin Demichelis

Argentina
 have looked better for his presence and, although a gaffe is never too 
far away, the veteran has been solid and reliable.

VERDICT:
 Manchester City past and present, but its former defender Boateng who 
gets the nod given his athleticism and ability to recover a situation. 
For once Demichelis makes a mistake it is invariably punished. 

Sliding in: City defender Demichelis did a good job marshaling Arjen Robben on Wednesday evening

LEFT BACK

Benedikt Howedes  

He is seldom exposed despite being more accustomed to a central role and is used to being charged with shackling the likes of Messi and Higuain.

Dependable: Benedikt Howedes has been solid throughout Germany's World Cup campaign

Marcos Rojo         

There were doubts about the Sporting defender given his preference for a more central posting but he has excelled at left-back.

VERDICT:
 Both players would prefer to be playing at centre-back but have adapted
 admirably to their duty in Brazil but it is the experience and know-how
 of Howedes which wins him the nod.

Passion: Argentina's Marcos Rojo celebrates after the shootout win over the Dutch

DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER

Bastian Schweinsteiger   

He keeps it simple but keeps the ball with it and is the heartbeat of this side. He has the personality for the biggest stage and will be desperate to add a World Cup to his enviable haul of trophies.

Experience: Schweinsteiger is playing in his sixth major tournament with Germany

Javier Mascherano       

Note
 to Barcelona: play him in midfield and Mascherano is the best in the 
business. He breaks play, builds play and whips others into shape with 
the standard he sets. His tackle to deny Arjen Robben at the death in 
the semi-final captured everything about his contribution; courageous, 
athletic and game-changing.

VERDICT:
 The Argentina man is an all-action hero whose side could not function 
without his influence, and for that he is deserving of his place ahead 
of Schweinsteiger.

DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER

Sami Khedira        

He turned in one of the performances of the finals against Brazil, combining graft and craft and chipping in with a goal. He gallops around the park but brings a classy, calming influence to the team at the same time.

Class act: Khedira controlled the game in Belo Horizonte as Germany beat Brazil 7-1

Lucas Biglia       

The
 Lazio man is understated but don’t underestimate his ability and he 
compliments well the snarl of Mascherano in the middle of the pitch.

VERDICT:
 Khedira is a class act and brings the recent – and invaluable - 
experience of his Champions League victory with Real Madrid to the 
party.

Chance: Lazio midfielder Biglia has only started two of Argentina's six World Cup games this tournament

ATTACKING MIDFIELDER 

Toni Kroos   

Much has been made of the scramble for his signature and now we know why. Be it five yards or fifty, left boot or right, Kroos locates his team-mates with unerring accuracy and – as his double against Brazil proved – he can be clinical in front of goal.

On his watch: Toni Kroos is one German midfielder who can control the pace of the game in Rio

Enzo Perez      

He did well against Holland and is bright and energetic. He is, however, no match for the injured Angel Di Maria.

VERDICT: ‘Kroos Control’ is the ultimate midfield player and will again seek to dictate affairs in the final.

Pace: Enzo Perez races away from Dirk Kuyt and Wesley Sneijder during the semi-final in Sao Paulo

ATTACKING MIDFIELDER 

Thomas Muller      

He
 can’t tackle, isn’t a great passer, doesn’t really have a turn of foot 
and can’t dribble – sound familiar? Each of the above has been said of 
Muller yet he has been the player of the tournament and his unyielding 
hunger for goals has been rewarded on five occasions.     

On the chase: Muller has a chance of being named Golden Boot winner for a second straight World Cup

Ezequiel Lavezzi           

The PSG forward works hard, yes, but where are the goals and assists? Much more is needed if Argentina are to upset the odds.

VERDICT: Muller is a star, Lavezzi is something of a myth.

Getaway: PSG star Lavezzi escapes Georginio Wijnaldum during the nervy semi-final

ATTACKING MIDFIELDER 

Mesut Ozil  

He has come in for criticism back in Germany and rightly so. He is the lazy link in this fantastic German side and has been a passenger during their journey to the final.        

Roar: Ozil has the chance to answer his critics after a quiet World Cup for Germany

Lionel Messi         

Is
 he saving one last explosion of magic for the final? We hope so. 
Outstanding in the group stage but subdued in the knockout rounds, Messi
 is nonetheless the best player on the park and without him Argentina 
would not stand a chance.

VERDICT: Even if Ozil had impressed – which he hasn’t – Messi would still win this one hands down. 

Superstar: Lionel Messi finally has the chance to make himself a hero on the biggest stage of all 

STRIKER

Miroslav Klose 

It’s a simple science: goals win games and, to that end, Mirsolav Klose is a match-winner. His 16 are now a World Cup record and, although he does little else around the pitch, who cares?

Down in history: Miroslav Klose is now the all-time leading goalscorer in World Cup history

Gonzalo Higuain    

Like
 Klose, Higuain is a man who trades in goals. However, it hasn’t 
happened for him in Brazil and he has, in truth, been a disappointment.

VERDICT:
 Higuain’s profligacy has almost cost his side but Klose has proved 
predatory in the big moments and is chosen ahead of the Argentine.

Up top: Napoli striker Higuain will lead Argentina from the front against Germany

Final score: Germany 8-3 Argentina
