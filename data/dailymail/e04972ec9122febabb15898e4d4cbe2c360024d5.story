A Seattle nurse has been accused of refilling morphine syringes with water to hide thefts of the drug.

Kelly Schwartz, 35, is facing federal charges stemming from allegations she stole morphine and similar opiate painkillers and refilled syringes with a saline solution at the EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland.

Patients were placed at risk of overdose and death by the thefts, when their dosages were increased by doctors after the diluted painkillers failed to ease their pain.

Position of trust: Schwartz is accused of stealing drugs intended for her patients, many of whom were recovering from surgery or serious illness

Kelly had worked at EvergreenHealth since August 2009 in the progressive care unit, caring for patients recovering from heart attack, stroke and surgery.

According to Seattle PI, a pharmacy technician noticed loose caps on syringes stored in the unit's pharmacy in 2012.

Tests later revealed that they were so highly diluted that the morphine levels were 'barely detectable.'

After an internal investigation, the hospital identified Schwartz as the suspect and confronted the nurse.

Seattle PI reports that Schwartz admitted the thefts after being accused by hospital staff in March 2012 and was immediately fired.

Diluted: Analysis found the syringes Schwartz is believed to have tampered with to contain just traces of morphine

Investigators with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration interviewed Schwartz, who told them she had become addicted to prescription painkillers following a back injury in 2009 and began stealing pain pills from patients after returning to work.

She hid the thefts by overstating about her patients' dosage on hospital charts.

She began stealing injectable morphine in 2011 after returning from maternity leave, diluting the drug and causing her patients to suffer with their pain without the help of the medicine that they had been prescribed.

'I tried not to think about it,' Schwartz told the agent, reports Seattle PI.

She has been charged with product tampering and was arrested in her home last Thursday. She is currently free on bond.
