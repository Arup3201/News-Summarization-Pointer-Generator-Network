Tragic end: Henrietta Dickson, 55 (pictured), was killed Tuesday after falling asleep in a parking space and being run over by a car

A homeless woman in Florida was tragically found dead Wednesday after spending the night pinned underneath a parked car.

Police believe Henrietta Regina Dickson, 55, may have been underneath the influence of drugs or alcohol when she fell asleep underneath a a Tampa apartment complex's carport Tuesday night.

Apartment resident Fathima K Masud, 55, pulled into her designated spot around 11:30pm, where Dickson was sleeping, and unknowingly ran the woman over.

Masud told police that she didn't know the woman was there, though she did feel a bump pulling into her parking space.

But when she got out of the car, she saw Dickson's tote bag and figured that's what she hit.

It wasn't until the following morning that a passerby finally saw Dickson's arm sticking out from underneath the front of the car.

Dickson was pronounced dead shortly after 8am

No charges have been filed against Masud.

'This is a very unusual and very sad case,' said Yolanda Fernandez of the St. Petersburg Police Department.

'She felt the bump and when she looked, it was a large tote bag full of things, full of clothing, and other items.Â  She just figured that's what she hit.'

No charges: The woman who ran over Dickson is not facing any charges in her death. Above, the apartment complex where the tragic incident unfolded
