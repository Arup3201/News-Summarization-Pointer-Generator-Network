Horrific: Attorney Maggie Baumer nearly lost her arm after trying to enter her apartment via garbage chute

A New York City lawyer is lucky to have her arm after she tried to enter a garbage chute in attempts to enter her ground-floor apartment.

Maggie Baumer was locked out of her Chelsea apartment, and had tried to jump through the garbage chute around 5am Sunday morning, activating a trash compactor.

The young woman was stuck in the compactor in excruciating pain for some 45 minutes before FDNY workers could free her.

According to the New York Post, Ms Baumer had lent her keys to a friend and forget to ask for them back.

Rather than calling a locksmith or her friend, she buzzed several different apartments until someone let her in the building.

To get to her ground-floor apartment, she tried to enter a trash compactor that would take her to the cellar, where she could then go through a window back into her apartment, the Post reported.

But rather than go down into the cellar, Ms Baumer was trapped by the compactor, which triggered a hydraulic piston to activate, crushing her arm.

A spokesperson for the FDNY told MailOnline that emergency workers arrived to the scene around 5:50am this morning.

They said that Ms Baumer was trapped in the compactor for about 45 minutes, in excruciating pain.

Firefighters and other emergency workers gave her morphine to cope with the pain, the Post reported.

When they extricated her, Ms Baumer’s arm was nearly severed. She was taken to Bellevue Hospital, and remains in critical condition after undergoing surgery.

Alcohol could have played a factor in the bizarre accident, a source told the New York Daily News.

According to her biography on Goldstein & Lee’s website, Ms Baumer graduated from Tufts University’s law school and joined the firm full-time shortly after.
