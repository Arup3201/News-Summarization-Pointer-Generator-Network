The uncle of a four-year-old boy who drowned after slipping into the sea has been killed in a crash - just hours after laying flowers to mark the young boy's birthday.

Peter Thurlow, 42, travelled this week to Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, to lay flowers at the scene where his nephew Dylan died in August 2012.

But within hours of the flowers being 
placed, Mr Thurlow, 42, was killed in a collision with a lorry on the M5
 motorway.

Pete Thurlow, 42, had travelled to Burnham-on-Sea just one day before the crash to lay flowers at the scene where his nephew Dylan died, on what would have been the young boy's sixth birthday

Speaking on her son Dylanâ€™s Facebook memorial page, Miss McCollum confirmed the news that Dylan's uncle had been killed.

She said: 'Dylan as you know me daddy aunty lisa and uncle pete came to burnham to lay you flowers for your 6th birthday.

'Only 50mins after midnight your uncle pete was tragicly [sic] killed on the motorway in burnham.

'Please take care of each other up their [sic] fly high. Love you both to the moon and back xxxxx.'

Mr Thurlow, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, made the 170-mile journey to 
lay flowers for Dylan on what would have been the young boy's sixth birthday.

He travelled to the Somerset town where the tragedy took place, with his 
wife Lisa, as well as Dylan's parents Rachel McCollum and Darren Cecil, on Tuesday.

Little Dylan Cecil drowned in August 2012 after falling from a jetty while on holiday with his family. His mother and father both jumped in to try and save their son but he was swept away by strong currents

But while he was returning home, he was involved in the crash, which took place between Weston-Super-Mare and Burnham-on-Sea, and was killed.

A police spokesman confirmed Mr Thurlow had been killed in the crash but said they were not yet sure of the circumstances.

The tragedy is the second to hit the 
family in as many years.

Dylan Cecil drowned on August 19, 2012 after 
falling the jetty into Bridgwater Bay, Somerset, while 
visiting his grandmother, Jackie McCollum.

The family had been going for a stroll at 6pm in the evening when the tragedy unfolded.

An inquest into his death heard how Dylan lost his footing while playing with his two younger sisters.

His mother tried in vain to save her four-year-old son, leaping into the water with Dylan's father, Darren.

But the young boy had been carried away by strong currents.

The tides at Burnham-on-Sea are believed to be some of the highest and most powerful in the world.

It was estimated that the speed of the current on the day was around four or five knots, approximately 5mph, strong enough to easily sweep an adult off their feet.

Four days later, after an extensive search involving RNLI and the local Burnham Area Rescue Boat, Dylanâ€™s body was discovered.

Speaking about the crash in which Mr Thurlow died, a police spokesman said: 'He was among a group of people from Kettering who had been attending a memorial service in Burnham-on-Sea. It is all in connection with the young boy who tragically drowned.

'We are not yet sure of the circumstances of the manâ€™s death so we are appealing for witnesses to contact the collision investigation team.'
