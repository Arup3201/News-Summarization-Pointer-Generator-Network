Nadeem Hussain has been jailed for 10 months after he carried out a road rage attack on a horse called Merlin and its rider

A white van driver who rammed his vehicle into a horse and rider has been jailed.

A judge branded Nadeem Hussain a bully and said he had used his vehicle as a weapon.

Hussain was driving along a country lane when Charlotte Watmough signalled for him to slow down. Instead, the father of five skidded to a halt and got out of his vehicle.

Words were exchanged before Hussain got back into his van and drove forwards a few feet, past the horse and rider.

He then slammed it into reverse and drove into Miss Watmough's mount, Merlin, pushing him into a wall.

The animal panicked and reared up, causing the rider to lose her stirrups and have to fight to stay in the saddle.

Merlin, a 12-year-old Anglo Arab, was later seen by a vet, who found he had suffered bruising to his fetlock.

Miss Watmough, 20, who has ridden regularly since she was three, was left traumatised, with a sore arm, shoulders and neck, caused by the force with which she had to hold on to the horse.

Hussain, 31, drove off after the incident in Baxenden, Accrington, Lancashire, but the rider noted his registration number and he was later arrested.

Hussain, of Accrington, admitted dangerous driving and was jailed for ten months at Burnley Crown Court.

He was also banned from driving for a year and must take an extended retest.

Speaking afterwards, Miss Watmough, of Rossendale, Lancashire, said she was delighted with the sentence and urged drivers to show more respect to riders.

She said: 'It's just brilliant, when I 
got the news I couldn't believe it. I never expected him to go to prison
for that length of time.

'It will hopefully give him time to think about what he did.'

The student, who is due to begin a course in primary school teaching, added: 'Because Merlin was rearing up, I just hung on trying to control him.

'I was screaming at the top of my voice, I thought I was going to fall off and get run over or be squashed by Merlin. Thinking back, it was really, really dangerous. I could have been paralysed.

'It was just so random, I was so shocked - it wasn’t provoked, I’m always polite.

'I’ve never come across anyone like that out on the road.

'I didn’t think he would stop until either I or Merlin was on the floor.

'I couldn’t sleep for about a week afterwards. I just kept waking up crying and I was referred to counselling by my doctor. It still upsets me and I’m nervous when I go out riding.'

Sarah Johnston, prosecuting, said 
Miss Watmough described herself as an experienced rider, having ridden 
almost every day for 16 years.

She had been wearing a specialised hat and a high visibility vest when the incident occurred.

She was riding her horse on Back Lane, in Baxenden, on June 26 last year when Hussain's van came round a bend in front of her and, instead of slowing down, approached her at some speed.

The prosecutor told the court that 
Miss Watmough had put up her right hand, with her palm out flat, to 
signal to the driver to slow down, but he made no effort to do so and 
skidded to a halt.

She had tucked Merlin in as far as possible and was effectively looking down on the van roof. At the time the horse was not frightened, as he was used to vehicles and traffic.

Hussain got out of his vehicle, words were exchanged and he was said to have threatened to ram the horse with his van. Miss Watmough was scared and explained all she had intended by her gesture was to invite him to slow down.

The defendant got back in his van, drove forward ten to 12 feet, slammed on his brakes and then reversed towards the horse, pushing him into a wall, before driving off.

Defending, Martin Hackett, said 
Hussain accepted there had been an 'altercation' but denied getting out 
of his vehicle or reversing into the horse. He claimed Miss Watmough had
hit him with her 'riding stick'.

Hussain agreed that reversing towards the animal and rider was dangerous and likely to frighten the horse, but said that he did not deliberately aim for the animal.

Judge
Beverley Lunt told him he had intended to frighten the horse and rider 
and his actions could have had very serious consequences.

She continued: 'You behaved like a bully. You used your vehicle to intimidate and threaten. That's like using it as a weapon.

'People
who lose their temper and use their cars to threaten and intimidate, 
and where they cause fear and harm, must understand the consequences 
will be severe.'
