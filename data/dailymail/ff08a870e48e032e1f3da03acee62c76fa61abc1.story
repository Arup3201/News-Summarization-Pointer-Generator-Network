The latest image of the hoax Crabzilla haunting Whitstable's shores has emerged, showing the giant crab lurking beneath two young boys fishing.

The photo appears to show the two boys happily fishing for crabs, unaware that a far bigger prize is beneath them.

Crabzilla has been dismissed as a hoax by experts who say the existence of such a crustacean is impossible, and it is possibly the work of camera trickery or some well placed sandbanks on the shore. 

But the images, the first of which emerged last week as an aerial photo, have still attracted worldwide attention.

A new photo has emerged of Crabzilla, apparently lurking beneath Whitstable pier where two boys are fishing

Experts and sceptics have said it would be impossible for Crabzilla to have grown to such a size.

The photo is the second image to appear of the impossibly large crustacean, which would measure 50ft wide and be 10 times as big as Britain's largest crab.

It appeared on the Weird Whitstable website which said in a statement: 'This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken in July.

'The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passers-by shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water into the dark, sideways.'

Crabzilla is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches (12cm) .

Quinton Winter, who first shared the image and curates the Weird Whitstable site, said it had been a bit of fun and he did not expect anyone to believe there was such a large crustacean in British waters.

Sea-life expert Dr Verity Nye, who has worked on logging new species of crab, has previously said Crabzilla is impossible. 

She said while there were species of giant crustacean in Britain, these tend to lurk in deeper waters. 

The largest in Britain is the spider crab, which grows to 1.5 metres and tends to stay in water around 1,000m deep. 

Crabzilla appears to be about ten times this size.

It would be even larger than the biggest crab in the world - the Japanese Spider crab, which grows to around 3.7 metres.

Dr Nye, an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton, said: 'Crabs are amazing because they are so diverse, we have about 60 species around the UK, and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found, but I laughed when I saw this picture.'

Some have blamed the latest pictures of Crabzilla on Photoshop trickery.

However some appear to have been taken in or just going along with the series of comic photos, with people posting messages on Twitter.

Comedian Frank Skinner, 57, also revealed he had abandoned plans to move there are being 'put off' by the giant crab, according to the Daily Star. 

Mr Winter, an artist and curator of the Weird Whitstable site, has said he understands most people do not believe the image is real.

He told Kent Messenger: I don't think anyone seriously believes there actually is a 50ft crab in Whitstable. What would it feast on? Fat, juicy Londoners?'
