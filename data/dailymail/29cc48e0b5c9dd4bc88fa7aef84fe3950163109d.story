Christmas photos of the whole family eating turkey and roast potatoes while wearing silly hats are meant to make you smile.

But when Claire King, 26, saw photographs of her 18.5 stone, size 24 self guzzling last year's festive feast, she was mortified.

Shamed into accepting her morbid obesity, the travel agent from Suffolk decided to do something about it - and has in just one year lost almost eight stone, enough weight to slip into a size 10 Christmas party dress.

Claire embarked on a intensive diet and 
exercise regime, and a year on, is thrilled to be able to slip into a 
slinky size 10 dress - after losing 36 inches of body fat

After seeing photos of herself with her mouth full of food over Christmas 2011, Claire flicked back through photos of her taken with her sisters and cousins every Christmas day - and her expanding waistline was clear to see.

She embarked on a intensive diet and 
exercise regime, and a year on, is thrilled to be able to slip into a 
slinky size 10 dress - after losing 36 inches of body fat.

Claire, from Bury St Edmunds, said: 'I knew I was big but I'd always been in denial about my size, hiding it behind my bubbly personality.

'But when I saw pictures of myself taken last Christmas day, I was mortified. I'd made an effort to look nice but I just looked enormous.

'It was the wake up call I needed into shocking me to do something about my weight - I finally accepted that I was morbidly obese.'

Claire said: 'I looked back at the photos over the years and realised while my sisters and cousins were growing up, I was growing out'

Claire had begun gaining weight as a teenager, developing unhealthy eating habits of takeaways and junk food, then eating even more as comfort food when she became larger and larger.

By Christmas 2011, she weighed in at 18st 4lb. Claire said: 'I'd never really tried to lose weight properly before - but seeing that picture of me standing in front of a Christmas tree shocked me.

'There was another picture that someone took of me mid-mouthful of Christmas dinner, which was just awful. I'm really close to my family, and every year, my dad takes a picture of me and my two sisters, and our two cousins, on our sofa on Christmas day.

'I looked back at the photos over the years and realised while they were growing up, I was growing out. I'm thrilled this year that I can slip on the sofa next to them and have a picture taken that I can be proud of.'

After learning that her boss had lost weight on the Cambridge Weight Plan she gave the soup and shakes diet a go in January.

By April she had begun to introduce small amounts of 'real' food back into her diet - after shedding more than four stone.

And when she travelled to America to meet friends who were four months into a round the world trip, they struggled to recognise her at the airport.

She added: â€œI deliberately kept my weight loss to myself - I wanted to surprise my friends when I saw them.

'I'd lost 4st 5lb by the time I travelled out to meet them on their journey - they were flabbergasted when they saw me.

'Their reaction felt so good that it inspired me to keep going and carry on towards my target weight. I even managed to lose three pounds while I was on holiday in America.'

Claire has managed to keep her weight-loss up, and now weighs 10st 9lb, saying these are 'numbers I never thought I'd see on the scales!'.

She added: few weeks ago a customer 
came into work and asked for Claire - I told him that was me, and he 
said: "No, this is a plump lady with frizzy hair".

'I told him I'd lost a few pounds and had my hair cut - he was mortified.
The man who drives the bus I take every day to work even stopped saying
hello to me because he thought I was someone else - it feels great!'

And this Christmas, Claire will be 
being more careful about what she eats: ''I've worked really hard to get
the excess weight off and keep it off - so there'll be no second 
helpings of Christmas dinner for me this year.

'I'd much rather be able to fit in a gorgeous dress for the Christmas party than munch on a pile of mince pies.'

Claire's slimming consultant Helen McGaffin said: 'When I first met Claire, I knew she was determined to change her life.

'Seeing her shed the pounds each week has been so rewarding for us both - I am so proud of her. She is an inspiration, looks fantastic, and to top it off, I've gained a friend for life.'
