Fired: Paramedic Bryce Reed was dismissed from the West, Texas emergency response squad two days after the blast

The West, Texas first responder arrested for having bomb-making materials made several rambling postings on his Facebook account just hours before police arrested him and brought him into custody.

Multiple times over the past week, Bryce Reed discussed about how hard recent days have been. He had been fired from his job just two days after the explosion and his wife, Brittany, left him shortly thereafter.

'Integrity is so hard, especially when it is attacked,' Reed wrote in a post in the early hours of Monday morning. 'I am so sick of being strong. I am so sick of crying. You try to do the right thing, and get kicked for it. I’m so done. I seek no accolades or commendations, I simply wanted to honor the fallen.'

Not having much luck sleeping, six and a half hours later, he wrote in another post emotionally charged post.

'Last night was very hard, but I know I worried a lot of you and I am so very sorry,' Reed wrote. 'I am incredibly emotional right now, and it seems like every time I turn around somebody is critiquing me. I’m vertical/breathing so I really cant complain, but I would encourage all of you to follow this: LOVE, not fake love, but LOVE one another.'

He posted that he is 'appalled at how people are tearing me apart.'

'I have not received ONE CENT for ANYTHING that I did to help with this situation,' Bryce Reed wrote the following day. 'I have not been paid by the media, by press, I made nothing for delivering my brothers eulogy, and made NOTHING off of this tragedy. I was a shoulder to cry on, I found a GREAT new family, and was blessed to get to tell them about their son.'

Arrest: Paramedic Bryce Reed, has been arrested after he was found to possess explosives

Destruction: This apartment complex near the fertilizer plant was destroyed by the explosion

Grieving: At last month¿s public memorial for the 12 people killed responding to the fire, Reed gave a heartfelt and often humorous eulogy for his close friend Cyrus Reed

As an EMT, he was one of the first 
responders on the horrific scene; he became a frequently quoted media 
source, giving emotional interviews to reporters about the loss of his 
best friend in the explosion; but his actions also began to rub some 
West residents and officials the wrong way.

The blast left 15 people dead and around 200 others injured.

In the days following the tragedy, Reed spoke with several media outlets about his experience at the scene.

Fallen: Reed has been accused of stealing from blast victim and firefighter Cyrus Reed, pictured, who Reed eulogized and has referred to as his brother

At a public memorial last month for 
the 12 people killed responding to the fire at the plant, Reed appeared 
in a videotaped eulogy for Cyrus Reed, a volunteer firefighter from 
Abbott, Texas, who Bryce Reed referred to as his 'brother', though the 
two were not related.

Whatever was weighing on Bryce Reed's
mind clearly prompted the anguished Facebook posts. Just days later was
charged in federal court with possession of a bomb.

According to an FBI affidavit, a 
friend of his living in Abbott had 'unwittingly' taken possession of 
pipe bomb components from Reed on April 26.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in the 
Western District of Texas said that authorities will not speculate 'at 
this time' about any connection between the destructive device and the 
fertilizer plant explosion.

Yet, hours later, Texas law enforcement announced they were launching a criminal investigation into the explosion.

Authorities allege Reed possessed 
canisters that included a lighter, a digital scale, a plastic spoon and 
'several pounds of chemical powders' in separate bags.

Speaking to The Dallas Morning News, 
Reed’s stepfather, Gary Nelson, said there was 'not a chance' that Reed 
was involved in the explosion.

'He’s been tore up about it', Nelson said. Nelson said Reed’s family is '100 percent behind him.'

But such sentiments are not strictly correct.

Bryce's wife Britany left her husband
in the weeks since the explosion. He mentions that it was because he 
was 'lost in his own emotions'.

'I have not been paid by the media, 
by press, I made nothing for delivering my brothers eulogy, and made 
NOTHING off of this tragedy. I was a shoulder to cry on, I found a GREAT
new family, and was blessed to get to tell them about their son. THIS 
IS NOT ABOUT ME!!! IT IS ABOUT 12 HEROS THAT DIED TO SAVE LIVES!!!!! I 
am blessed to be alive. Period. I lost a lot in this and there have been
INCREDIBLY kind people who are taking donations so I can get a HOME AND
LIFE back, however, never would I PROFIT from anyones death. I loved 
and still love Cyrus A. Reed, and he loved me. I did and will do what I 
thought was right. Was I emotionally devistated? Hell yes I was. Have 
your brother die, your town explode, your crew be emotionally wrecked, 
and in the midst of it have your wife leave you because you are lost in 
your own emotions: ALL IN THE SAME WEEK, and see how you fare. People I 
am doing my BEST to hold myself together, but please for the love of God
quit picking me apart. I have to bury yet ANOTHER friend tomorrow. God 
Bless

Public grief: At last month's public memorial for the 12 people killed responding to the fire, Bryce Reed (pictured) gave a heartfelt and often humorous eulogy for his close friend Cyrus Reed (not related)

The sister of Cyrus Reed (not 
related), the firefighter Bryce Reed eulogized last month, said her 
family had been 'fooled' by him.

'He convinced us that he and Cyrus 
were very close, like brothers,' Sarah Reed said. 'But I want people to 
know they are not brothers, and he is not part of our family.'

Sarah Reed told the Morning News that
she and her family had gone through Cyrus Reed’s computer and cell 
phone records and, as the paper put it, 'found that the two first 
responders might not have been as close as the suspect led the public to
believe.'

Furthermore, Sarah Reed said, she had
asked police to guard Cyrus Reed’s apartment, because she was concerned
that Bryce Reed had been stealing from it.

In fact, state health officials have 
confirmed that Reed was fired from his EMT job at the Texas emergency 
response squad just two days after the catastrophic blast, accused of 
stealing from a fireman killed in the explosion.

Speaker: Bryce Reed was a paramedic who essentially became a spokesperson for the town of West after last month's deadly explosion at a fertilizer facility

Charged: Bryce Reed, a first responder at the fertilizer plant blast in West, Texas, is facing a charge of possession of a destructive device

Still, Reed's arrest was drawing 
attention in part because in the days following the blast, Reed didn't 
shy away from media attention in West. He gave interviews to most major 
news outlets.

At last month's public memorial for 
the 12 people killed responding to the fire, Reed gave a heartfelt and 
often humorous eulogy for someone whom he claimied was a his close 
friend of hit, Cyrus Reed.

He gave lengthy interviews to reporters, while other emergency responders didn't want to talk.

Another of Reed's bizarre claims came
in an interview outside the Czech Inn on April 21, when he spoke about 
being sick and facing his own mortality.

He said that he lost 60 pounds in 
five months, and that doctors couldn't pinpoint the source of his ailing
stomach despite performing 26 biopsies.

Three days after the explosion, Reed 
climbed onto a coffee table at a local hotel where displaced families 
picked over donated sweatshirts and pizza, telling the crowd, 'You're 
safe where you're at.'If you're not, I'd be dragging you out of here myself.'

Clearup: Students clean debris at a home in West, Texas, that was damaged due to the explosion. The blast caused tens of millions of dollars in damage to the surrounding area

Fatalities: Among the 14 people killed were 10 emergency responders

On Friday afternoon in West, several 
of Reed's neighbors stood outside near his red brick duplex, a 
neighborhood less than a mile from the plant where some homes' windows 
remained boarded.

They said they were shocked about his arrest.

Crystal Le Dane said he was a good 
neighbor who had changed her flat tire and sometimes gave medical advice
about her children's minor injuries and rashes.

'I would say he's an everyday guy. I never saw a red flag,' she said.

Reed grew up in suburban Dallas and said he had lived in West for 12 years.

On his LinkedIn profile, Reed said he spent time at the U.S. Biological and Chemical Weapon Depot in Ft McClellan, Alabama.

Reed also lists one year from 
2010-2011 as a technician/regional safety officer for Allied 
International Emergency LLC., where he said response teams dealt with 
'Weapons of Mass Destruction Response, Nuclear Event Management, 
Chemical or Biological Weapons Containment, Large Scale Environmental 
Loss Mitigation, to DOT/EPA small scale spill cleanup...'

However, in a profile, the Dallas 
Morning News found other inconsistencies in Reed’s self-portrayal, 
including degrees listed on his resume that it appears he never actually
completed.

Residents began to have more serious 
questions about Reed after it appeared he had woven different stories to
different people about what had happened, and alternately telling 
people he was a police officer and a government representative.

The paper surmises that it is hard to know what is true and what is fabrication when it comes to Reed.

By Wednesday of this week, Reed began
to buckle under the pressure and wrote that he was going to take a 
break from Facebook to “reflect.”

'I assure you that I’m ok,' he wrote.
'God bless you all, and please if you heed nothing else I have said, 
love one another. God bless. Bryce.'

He'll have plenty of time to reflect now he is in police custody until his next court hearing in the middle of next week.
