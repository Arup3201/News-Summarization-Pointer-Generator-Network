Councillor Sonia Andjelkovic, deputy leader for regulatory services, said: 'This will send a clear message out that the illegal use of amplified equipment to advertise services in public places will not be tolerated.

'East Staffordshire Borough Council is committed to investigating complaints of noise nuisance, which includes noise from loudspeakers used to advertise entertainment, trade or business.

'If any residents witness any collectors using amplified equipment, we would ask them to contact the Pollution Team in the first instance, detailing as much information as possible including the vehicle registration number, date, time and location.'
