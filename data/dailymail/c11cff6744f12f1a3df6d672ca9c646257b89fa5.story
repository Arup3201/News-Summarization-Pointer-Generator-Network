Tasteless photos of tourists doing handstands between and skipping upon the gigantic stones of Berlin’s Holocaust Memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe have been condemned in Germany.

Social media sites such as Facebook have been flooded in recent weeks with pictures of young visitors frolicking among the giant maze of stones constructed to remember the six million Jewish victims of the Nazi extermination programme in the Second World War.

One picture even shows an Asian girl behind two friends giving the middle finger to the camera inside the memorial.

Social media sites have been flooded 
with pictures of visitors posing on the giant stones at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial - a site constructed in memory of six 
million Jewish victims who died at the hands of the Nazi regime

This visitor at the memorial site posed for a photo by jumping off the stones and then using the hashtags '#happy' '#girl' '#weeeee'. She even put an smiley-style emoticon at the end of her post

This visitor to Auschwitz - where 1.1million Jews were killed - posed 
with her thumbs up for a photo, while using the caption 'Thumbs up if 
you're chilly willy'

Another trend sweeping social media sites is to pose at the gate of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp using the hashtag #arbeitmachtfrei - a phrase
 used by the Nazi regime which means 'work sets you free'

There has also been a spike in photos of tourists larking about at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial outside of Berlin.

Some 200,000 people were deported to Sachsenhausen before and during the war and 30,000 were murdered there, many in cruel medical experiments.

A favourite snapshot posted on the Internet seems to be of youngsters hanging off the steel gate that bears the cruel lie of the Nazi Regime ‘Arbeit Macht Frei’, which means 'work sets you free'.

One young woman received 20 ‘likes’ of the photo of herself at the infamous gate when she posted it on Facebook.

'These snapshots really are shameful,' said the best selling newspaper BILD in a commentary on the disturbing new trend.

'The gate of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp has a particularly tragic notoriety - good enough reason not to hang off of it. Why are these people showing no respect at all for the dead?'

This tourist posted a photo of herself jumping between the stones of the Berlin memorial, using the hashtag '#goodtimes'. German newspaper BILD said the snapshots were 'shameful'

This tourist also used the hashtag '#happy' as she posed at the memorial in Berlin. There are now an estimated 10,000 photos of young people larking about at the site posted on the internet

These two girls posted a picture saying 'Being sad at the holocaust memorial' before posing with 'sad' faces

Dr Horst Seferens, in charge of the Sachsenhausen site which is now a memorial museum to its victims, said: 'Sometimes schoolchildren are overwhelmed with what they see and lark about or simply burst out laughing. Then the staff have to intervene to restore calm.'

Police are continually having to reprimand people at the Holocaust Memorial near Berlin’s famous Brandenburg Gate for jumping between the stones, picnicking on them and sometimes even urinating inside the maze built to symbolize the feelings of loss and bewilderment the Jews of the time felt when the Nazis came for them.

An estimated 10,000 photos of young people larking around at the site are now posted on the Internet - to the dismay of the Memorial Foundation for the Murdered Jews of Europe which administers the site.

A spokesman said: 'Photography is allowed but we have no authority over what kinds of photographs are taken.

'We cannot understand this trivialising of the memory of the dead at such a place. Many visitors simply do not know how to behave.'
