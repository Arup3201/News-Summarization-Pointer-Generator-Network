As excitement builds around Sunday's El Clasico showdown between Barcelona and Real Madrid at the Nou Camp, Sportsmail asked two fans to take part in a Q&A.

Enrique Schoch from totalBarca (part of the Football Collective blog network) and Lucas Navarrete from Managing Madrid answered questions on Spain's biggest rivalry, what they make of the La Liga title race and how past results and recent form will affect the clash.

Feeling confident?

ES: It’s never wise to feel overly confident in matches like El Clasico. That said, Barca are coming off an incredibly impressive display midweek and frankly a very good 2015, whereas Real Madrid are having the exact opposite situation with iffy performances, Cristiano Ronaldo far from his best and a discontented Bernabeu crowd. 

LN: Not really, anything can happen in these matches, but Barcelona's form is so much better at the moment.

What would it mean to the fans of your team to win this game?

ES: As every year, a win in El Clasico is the sweetest victory and considering it would create distance in the league table, even sweeter.

LN: It'd be a crucial win to regain the first spot in the table and put this bad streak to an end.

Is this the biggest rivalry in European football?

ES: It’s certainly currently the rivalry with the most prestige and consequence. Real Madrid and Barcelona have the two best collections of footballers in the game and Clasicos are guaranteed exhibitions of a will to win and a very high level of football. 

LN: No question. Apart from football, it has political issues around it as well.

What are your memories of Real Madrid's 3-1 El Clasico win in October? 

ES: Utimately it's beyond debate, Madrid deserved the victory but had Lionel Messi made it 2-0 early on, the game would have been very different. But really it was no big deal, Barca were going through a lot of early adjustments with the manager and new players and losing is part of sport.

LN: Real Madrid completely outplayed Barcelona and deserved the win even after Messi and Co earned the lead.

What's changed for both teams since that result?

ES: Barca have gelled together extremely nicely, the style of play is both exciting and effective, whereas Real Madrid have stagnated, suffered a few key injuries and despite the spoils of talent elsewhere miss Ronaldo being Ronaldo.

LN: Ronaldo's form isn't that great, Messi is back and Real Madrid look tired.

You mention Ronaldo's poor form, What impact do you think he'll have? 

ES: Well, he’s long been one of the best in the world, but his 2015 has been rotten and he's often been totally ineffective in games. He needs others to facilitate him being his best more than Lionel Messi does. If the Barca defence put in a performance similar to that against Manchester City, I expect them to keep Ronaldo quiet. 

LN: Hard one to predict, but he should still be able to create some dangerous plays through Barcelona's shaky defensive system.

Meanwhile, Messi is on fire. Will Real be able to deal with him?

ES: Nobody can deal with Messi. 

SP: If Sergio Ramos' hamstring is healed, they definitely have a chance.

What are your plans for the day of the game?

ES: I’ll have some cule (Barcelona die-hards) friends over and watch with good company. Nothing complicated. 

LN: I'll be covering the game from the Nou Camp's press box for SB Nation's Managing Madrid.

What would a win for your team do to their La Liga title prospects? 

ES: Putting distance between Real Madrid can only help title prospects. Both teams have an equally challenging finish to the season so nobody would not want a four-point cushion. 

LN: It would make everything look much better, since a Barcelona win could potentially end the race for La Liga. At least, Real need to get a draw.

All the bookmakers expect Barcelona to be victorious here. What's your prediction? 

ES: Things feel very positive at Nou Camp right now so I would have to go with the bookies and say this dangerous new-look Barca will make come out with the win Sunday night.

LN: I'm expecting a 2-2 draw.
