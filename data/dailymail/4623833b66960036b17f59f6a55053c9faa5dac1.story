An Australian jihadist has sent sickening threats against his former country after a warrant was issued for his arrest by the Australian Federal Police.

Mohamed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf, from Sydney, are fighting with al-Qaeda off-shoot Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, in Syria, and will be arrested on terrorism-related charges if they ever return to Australia. 

'Did you think I would leave your country without leaving a surprise. Fireworks coming up soon keep a close eye,' Elomar wrote on Twitter, The Australian claims.

This comes after Daily Mail Australia revealed a disturbing photo of Elomar holding up two decapitated heads for the camera in Syria.

The picture was uploaded on Friday by his friend, convicted terrorist Sharrouf, on Twitter.

In the sickening image, Elomar is seen smiling - with a pair of sunglasses tucked into his shirt - as he holds up two decapitated heads by the victims' hair.

'ASIO dnt worry I'll be Bak in direct conflict very soon, just need abit time for my knee injury suffered against Jash Al hoor,' he wrote.

He added: 'Don't worry ASIO there is plenty of work for you guys coming up.'

He claimed people 'need to be stopped' and said there is a war on Islam

Another disturbing image, uploaded on Friday by Sharrouf, shows the heads of alleged Syrian solders being impaled on metal railings.

Like something out of the 18th century, the heads were left on show in a sickening display that aims to cause terror and fear.

The photos were shown alongside disgusting tweets such as 'bucket full of heads any1 in aus want some organs please dont be shy to ask I would love to assist u with body parts [sic]'.

His disturbing rant continued 'few more heads how lovely bludy amazing stuff abuhafs u keep cutting those infidel throats but the last 1 is mine! [sic]'

Sharrouf previously spent time in jail for his part in a foiled plot to blow up targets in Sydney and Melbourne.

He is thought to have flown to Syria with Elomar late last year on his brother Mustafa's passport.

Elomar's wife Fatima, 29, is still in Sydney with their four children.

She appeared in court in Sydney on July 8 charged with 'preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities'.

Fatima's lawyer, Zali Burrows, said on Tuesday that Elomar's arrest warrants for terrorism was not a surprise.

However, she told the Sydney Morning Herald that she doubts the veracity of the Twitter posts, saying Elomar did not use the social network. 

She also claimed the photo of Elomar with severed heads may have been photoshopped.

Elomar is also the brother of Ahmed Elomar, who was arrested in Lebanon for alleged terrorist links in 2007 and then sentenced to jail in Sydney in June for brutally bashing a police officer in the Hyde Park riots

Rioter Ahmed Elomar was sentenced to at least two and a half years in jail for the attack that happenned on September 15, 2012.

The former champion boxer hit an officer with a pole during a confrontation in Sydney’s angry Islamic march as part of a global protest against the anti-Islamic YouTube clip The Innocence of Muslims.

Judge Donna Woodburne said he had had 'agitated the crowd' as part of a group of 'aggressive men'.

Ahmed Elomar's barrister Greg James QC told the Sydney District Court that his client was suffering an 'impaired intellectual state'.

The two brothers, Ahmed and Mohamed, used to be champion boxers, Ahmed has competed in more than 20 professional bouts.

The convicted terrorist said he wanted to cut 'infidel throats'

He directed his tweets to people in Australia and joked about organ donation

In 2007, their father Mamdouh Elomar slammed the clerics who he believes radicalised his sons in Sydney.

Mr Elomar told The Sun-Herald that he urged his children to stay away from Sheik Mohammed at the Global Islamic Youth Centre.

'Sheiks like Feiz ruin people,' Mr Elomar said.

'He is not a sheik; he is brainwashing all these children. I know my religion, so I can tell him when he is wrong, but these kids believe everything he says and think it's their religion. Someone needs to stop him.

'Today our kids are either at one extreme, partying or using drugs, or at another extreme with their religion. I don't teach my children to hate non-Muslims. I have taught them to love everyone.'

On Thursday night Attorney General George Brandis's spokesman said that 'if real, these photos are evidence of serious crimes against Australian law and possible war crimes.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted AFP for further comment.

Sharrouf has also taunted Australian police via his social media account two weeks ago, boasting that he would 'slaughter' Australians.

Those tweets came as the nation's Director General of Security David Irvine revealed 'tens of people' had already returned to Australian shores from fighting alongside suspected terrorist organisations.

Speaking to media earlier this month, Attorney-General George Brandis said engagement with the Islamic community was an important strategy 'to keep Australia free from terrorism'.

'The imams who are faith leaders, who are influential and respected opinion members in their communities, are integral to our goal to saving young men - it is almost always young men - in their communities from being radicalised,' he said.

Mr Irvine added a majority of the 60 Australians they were aware of fighting with Islamic radicals were siding against the government with Al-Qaeda off-shoots.

'We have some tens of people that have already returned [from the Middle East], we have probably another 150 we're looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements,' he said.

When asked if the ones who had returned to Australia were being actively monitored, Mr Irvine said 'I'm not saying anything further'.

On July 14, Sharrouf fired off a tweet to the AFP and Australians, saying: 'you cowards I am running to my death I want martyrdom thats [sic] why I am blessed u rock spiders'.

Just half an hour earlier, he claimed 'Australia belongs to the muslims not infidels like you' as well as boasting of his evasion of police.

'u can't stop and trust me if I wanted to attack aus I could have easily,' Sharrouf said.

He also added: 'I love to slaughter [Australians] & ALLAH LOVEs when u dogs r slaughtered'.

These threatening tweets are part of a more disturbing picture of Sharrouf painted by his Twitter account.

Some of the content is so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to publish the posts.

On July 14, Sharrouf tweeted he loved to slaughter Australians to the AFP

He said it would have been easy for him to attack Australia if he wanted

Sharrouf's account is littered with photos of him posing with weapons and military trucks as well as a young child brandishing a rifle
