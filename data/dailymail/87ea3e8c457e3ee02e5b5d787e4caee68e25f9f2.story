Accused: Tamerlan Tsarnaev did kill his 'only American friend' and two others in a drug deal gone wrong according to court documents filed by federal prosecutors regarding the trial of his younger brother in Massachusetts today

Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev did participate in a brutal triple murder 16 months before the deadly marathon attack according to court records filed on Tuesday.

Brendan Mess, described as Tsarnaev's 'only American friend', Raphael Teken and Erik Weissman were murdered at their home  in Waltham, Massachusetts on the 10th anniversary of 9/11.

Their bodies were found covered in 
marijuana in the apartment and at the time authorities revealed their 
throats had been slit with a knife or ice pick and around $5,000 was left at the 
scene.

The startling disclosure was made by federal prosecutors who are trying to prevent his younger brother's legal team from obtaining documents concerning the killing of the three men on September 11, 2011.

It is the first official statement that links the now-dead elder Tsarnaev to the unsolved crime and raises questions about the death in May of his friend Ibragim Todashev, who allegedly confessed his and Tsarnaev's involvement to FBI agents before he was shot dead after charging them.

'According to Tsarnaev's friend Ibragim Todashev, Tamerlan Tsarnaev participated in the Waltham triple homicide,' prosecutors wrote in a motion filed on Monday according to MyFox Boston.

However, it has not been made clear when Todashev confessed and his family have strenuously denied his involvement.

The revelation that authorities are now sure that Tsarnaev was a murderer before he killed three and injured hundreds at the finishing line of the Boston Marathon in April came as prosecutors tried to block the efforts of the legal team of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

Victim: Brendan Mess was one of three victims in a triple slaying that Todashev allegedly confessed to police that he and Tsarnaev had committed in September 2011

His defense team want all the documents pertaining to the 2011 killings handed over to them and made admissible in court.

While this has no legal bearing on the terror charges that the 20-year-old suspect faces, the defense team is keen to prove that Dzhokhar was frightened or in thrall to his over-powering elder brother.

This would help fight against a possible recommendation against the death penalty.

In turn, prosecutors have argued the documents hold little value to the younger Tsarnaev's defense and handing over the files would jeopardise the Middlesex District Attorney's ongoing and 'active' investigation into the Waltham murders.

A judge is yet to rule on the decision.

However, the assertion that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was definitely involved in the gruesome murders raises more questions about the death of Todashev in May, who was shot and killed by an FBI agent in his own Orlando apartment.

He was being interviewed by federal agents and Massachusetts State Police about the Waltham murders and unconfirmed media reports from the time of the killings stated that he implicated himself and Tsarnaev.

He then charged the law enforcement officials who shot him dead, even though he was unarmed.

He allegedly become violent when police quizzed him over links to Tamerlan Tsarnaev and the unsolved 2011 triple homicide.Â 

Over two years after the triple murder at 12 Harding Avenue in Waltham, Massachusetts, investigators said for the first time today that Tamerlan Tsarnaev did in fact participate in the killings

In Sept. 2011, Brendan Mess, described as Tsarnaev's 'only American friend', Raphael Teken and Erik Weissman were murdered on September 11, 2011 at their home

It was claimed at the time that authorities were pressuring Todashev to make a full confession to the murders while they questioned him at his Orlando home.

It is known Tamerlan Tsarnaev was close friends with one of the victims, Mess, and the FBI have made statements previous to today's revelations that they were looking into whether he was one of the killers.

Normal life: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and a friend. The 19-year-old is set to stand trial for the Boston bombing

Law enforcement sources familiar with shooting in May told NBC that Todashev and Tsarnaev carried out the 2011 killings when a drug deal turned violent.

The suspects didn't want the three victims to be able to identify them, so they slit their throats, according to the network.

Deceased: Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot by an FBI agent. Initial reports said he had a knife but that was not true

DNA evidence apparently led them to Todashev and his Orlando apartment not far from Universal Studios on May 22.

He had been questioned for some hours before he allegedly flipped and the shooting came as one agent stepped out of the room, leaving Todashev alone with one officer, the New York Post said at the time.

In April, when asked if Tamerlan's implication in the Boston marathon bombings would make them reopen the case, a spokesman for the District Attorney's office was guarded.

'The 2011 triple homicide is an extremely important case for us and remains an active and open investigation.'

'Any
 information that comes forward as a result of the investigation into 
Tamerlan Tsnaraev and the Boston bombings will be immediately reviewed 
and pursued.'

Initially
police said two other people had been there on the day and they were 
looking to question them.

Investigators at the time said the murders were 'targeted and not a random act of violence.'

Middlesex District Attorney Gerard Leone
issued a statement soon after the murders saying, 'based on the present
state of the investigation, it is believed that the victims knew the 
assailant or assailants, and the attacks were not random.'
