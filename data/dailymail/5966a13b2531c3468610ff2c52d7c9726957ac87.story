Repair work today begun on Rio de Janeiro's famed Christ statue after two fingers and its head were chipped during recent lightning storms.

Officials believe it will take at least four months to repair the damage after workers carried out the first up-close examination of the 125-foot (38-meter) Christ the Redeemer statue following the lightning storms.

The right thumb of the statue was 
chipped during a violent storm last week, and its right middle finger 
and a spot on its head were damaged last month.

But the 100-ft tall statue, which is perched atop a mountain and offering spectacular views of Rio, will remain open to tourists.

Officials say they'll place more lightning rods on the statue to try to prevent future damage.

The Christ was inaugurated in 1931 and underwent a $4 million renovation in 2010.

The statue was struck by lightning when a powerful electric storm swept through the city emitting more than 40,000 lightning strikes throughout the state of Rio de Janeiro

The iconic statue is the largest stone-work of Jesus ever built and stands more than 2,000 feet above Rio on top of the Corcovado Hill.

Named one of the seven new wonders of the world in 2007, the statue is made of 700 tonnes of reinforced concrete.

This is not the first time the famous landmark has been hit by lightning. It was also hit by lightning in February 2008 and had to undergo a serious restoration because the bolt damaged its head and chipped the right thumb.
