A pilot was forced to turn a plane around when a fight broke out between two men after one reclined his chair.

The Swiss Airlines airbus was en route from Zurich to Beijing carrying 200 people when a 57-year-old Chinese man became angry after a passenger sitting in front of him reclined his chair during a meal, according to a Swiss-German newspaper.

Reported to be drunk, the man slapped the other on the head, another Chinese man aged 27-years-old, and a fight ensued as they rolled around in the aisle, shouting and swearing at each other for some minutes on Sunday.

Forced to turn around: A Swiss Airlines airbus had to fly back to Zurich after two men started physically fighting onboard

The two men were separated by an air steward and a passenger and the 57-year-old’s hands were tied together with plastic strips, newspaper Blick reported.

According to Blick, Valerie Sprenger a tourist guide who was onboard said: ‘The older of the two felt disturbed during his dinner. 

‘When the younger did not respond to his protests, he hit him on the head with the flat of his hand. It was a real slap.’

The man was restrained at the back of the aircraft but began screaming incessantly.

The pilot decided to turn the plane around to land in Zurich rather than in nearby Moscow ‘to avoid administrative problems’.

On arrival back in Zurich, both men were arrested and Swiss authorities detained the 57-year-old. The younger man was released.

A local magistrate said he was released yesterday and was fined an undisclosed amount.

The 200 passengers received an apology from Swiss Airline and a free night of accommodation in Zurich before taking next day's flight to China.

The two men were ordered to pay legal costs and the airline could still seek reimbursement to cover the extra plane fuel and accommodation costs for the other passengers for that night.
