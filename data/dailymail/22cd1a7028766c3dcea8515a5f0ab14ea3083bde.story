It's been branded as a 'suicidal mission' that may not deliver on its promises.

Despite this, the controversial Mars One project - which aims to send people to live on the red planet - has whittled down its shortlist of candidates from 200,000 to just 663.

From this, a final crew of four will be eventually be selected for a 'one-way ticket' to Marsm scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a gruelling seven-month journey from Earth.

The Mars One project has whittled down its shortlist of candidates to just 663 from 200,000 entries. This number will be reduced to 24 in the final rounds.

Additional teams would join the settlement every two years, with the intention that by 2033 there would be over twenty people living and working on Mars. 

There, they will collect data, plant oxygen-producing vegetation and set the foundation for human colonisation.

The majority of the 663 applicants - the full list can be viewed here - come from the US, with India and China coming in second and third place. 

In spite of the risks, more than 200,000 people from around the world applied when the Netherlands-based group called for volunteers to join the mission.

In the next stage, which may involve 'rigorous, potentially televised competitions', the current shortlist will be reduced to 24.

The time frame for this next stage depends how long it takes the team to sort through the 663 on the list.

Chris Hadfield, former commander of the ISS, recently said that the mission may not deliver on this promise. 'There's a great, I don't know, self-defeating optimism in the way that this project has been set up,' he warned

Chris Hadfield, former commander of the ISS, recently told Elmo Keep, writing in Medium that the mission may not deliver on this promise.

'There's a great, I don't know, self-defeating optimism in the way that this project has been set up,' Hadfield told Medium.

The Mars One project plans to launch a supply mission to land on Mars as soon as October 2016.

A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018.

The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips ‘much safer than moon missions’.

The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade.

Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days.

'I fear that it's going to be a little disillusioning for people, because it's presented as if for sure it's going to happen.'

Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother, said earlier this year it will be documenting the progress of the group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the red planet.

Candidates do not need to have any scientific qualifications and an audience vote will be used to make the final choice.

Any chosen Mars settlers will then be required to dedicate eight years of their lives preparing for the 300 million-mile (482 million km) pioneering mission.

Igore Mitrofanov of the Space Research Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences told the Voice of Russia that the largest risk is the huge amounts of radiation the volunteers will receive.

Echoing Mr Hadfield's concerns, he said he doubts that the volunteers for this trip know enough science and technology to take the risk.

The group had promised on its site that in 1,000 years, everyone on Earth will remember who the first humans on Mars were.

The next round will include an interview with Mars One committee members, and candidates advancing to the third round will compete against one another.

The third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates for the potential mission and could broadcast on television and online.

But Mr Hadfield claims Mars should not be a target for colonisation at this point, but targets much closer need to be considered.

'We absolutely need to do it on the moon for a few generations,' he told Mr Keep.
