Lionel Messi's vow to the late Tito Vilanova on his deathbed is why the Argentine superstar remains at the Nou Camp, former Barcelona assistant Henk ten Cate has claimed.

The Dutch coach, who worked under Frank Rijkaard when Messi debuted at the club in 2004, said Messi promised close confidant Vilanova that he would stay at the Catalan giants.

Ten Cate spoke to Holland's De Telegraaf amid speculation Messi is unhappy and looking to move elsewhere due to a rift with current boss Luis Enrique.

'Messi is only still at Barcelona because he promised it to Tito Vilanova at his deathbed,' Ten Cate told De Telegraaf, adding there were signs of problems two years ago.

Messi shared a close relationship with Vilanova, who stepped up to the main job at Barcelona in 2012 and together they won the La Liga on their first try. Vilanova stepped down due to ill health and died from cancer in April last year.

Despite Messi apparently giving Vilanova his word, Ten Cate believes a move would be the best thing for both parties.

"I think a transfer would be in everybody's best interest,' Ten Cate says. 'Lionel has been at Barcelona for quite a while and he needs a new challenge. He's still worth a lot of money now but his value will only go down from here on.'

Messi didn't train on Monday, citing gastroenteritis, but returned on Wednesday. 

At a press conference Enrique refused to 'confirm or deny those reports' in relation to a clash with Messi and other senior players. 

'Messi is the best player in the world and I have said this many times,' he said. 'I have the same relationship with all my players that I had at the start of the season.'

Although Barcelona sit just one point from Real Madrid in the league, the club is enduring a tumultuous time behind the scenes.

Messi started on the bench in the 1-0 loss to David Moyes' Real Sociedad on Sunday.

Sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta has now been shown the door while club legend Carles Puyol, who was his assistant, also left.

Club presidential elections have also been brought forward to the summer in a bid to 'reduce the tension at the club', said Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who confirmed he would run. 

Bartomeu also said Enrique would not be sacked.
