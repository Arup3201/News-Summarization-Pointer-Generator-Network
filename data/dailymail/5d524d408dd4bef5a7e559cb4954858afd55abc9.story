Beatrix Potter's original paintings of the five little pigs from the famous nursery rhyme is itself going to market in an auction expected to fetch up to £70,000.

The children's rhyme, which begins with the words 'this little pig went to market', is a variation of the ancient folk verse that is usually counted on a person's toes and ends in a foot tickle and the words 'wee wee wee all the way home'.

The meticulously sketched watercolours are among a set of pictures by the Peter Rabbit creator that will go under the hammer at Sotheby's tomorrow.
