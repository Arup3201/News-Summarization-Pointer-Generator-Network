A teenager accused of plotting a 'new Columbine' massacre laughed in the dock today as he said that his threat to shoot children at his school was just a 'joke'.

Michael Piggin, 18, allegedly drew up a 'hit list' of pupils and teachers that he wanted to murder as he stored weapons, including a crossbow, knives and homemade bombs in his bedroom alongside terrorist manuals.

The teenager, who also had a giant swastika flag above his bed, planned to target two schools in his hometown of Loughborough, as well as a mosque, cinema, university and council offices.

Michael Piggin who had planned a 'new Columbine' massacre said today that the plans were 'a joke' and he never intended to carry out the attack

He dubbed his plans for an armed assault on his former school as 'the new Columbine', the Old Bailey heard.

Jurors watched a video where Piggin 
and his two friends tried to make a noxious gas bomb by boiling cleaning
 products and petrol bombs.

The home-made bomb is commonly referred to as a Molotov 
cocktail.

In his diary he said he wanted to throw a bomb into a children's play area and shoot 'all the motherf****rs'. 

Piggin told the jury the comment was a 'joke' but admitted that the bombs were real.

Last week, the court heard that Piggin had been bulled at school. 'People kept starting on me so I went to a different school. I didn't have any friends. I used to go home from school and just read in my room,' he told jurors.

Asked who bullied him, Piggin said: 'I was bullied quite a lot by Asians. I remember one incident in particular with a Bengali boy. He beat me up.'

Piggin, who suffers from Asperger syndrome, then alienated his only two friends after he spoke obsessively about explosives and his 'operation', jurors were told today.

When one of his friends asked him to change the subject he threatened to 'kill him first' and described how he would 'snap' his friend's neck.

When police searched Michael Piggin's bedroom they found a giant swastika, a copy of 'Mein Kampf' by Adolt Hitler, military books and a copy of Zero Day, a film dramatising the 1999 Columbine school shooting

'No matter what, he is a dead man, I will kill him first,' Piggin wrote in a Facebook message to his other classmate.

'I will, honestly I will snap his neck - you know I will.'

But Piggin told the jury that he 'didn't mean it' and was had not intended to carry out the attack.

In his diary, Piggin threatened to kill antiques dealer David Dickinson who presents the series 'Dickinson's Real Deal'.

He also said that he wanted to blow up high street bargain chain Poundland because 'it's too expensive'.

He laughed in the witness stand as he denied wanting to carry out the threats.

Michael Piggin was bullied at school the court heard. His only two friends then became tired of his talk of killing. He also sent a Facebook message to one classmate saying how he would 'snap' his other friend's neck. 'I will, honestly I will snap his neck - you know I will,' he wrote

In his diary, read to jurors at the Old Bailey Piggin said he wanted to throw a bomb into a children's play area shoot 'all the motherf***ers'.

Prosecutor Max Hill QC asked the teenager about a quantity of cable ties, normally used to hold wires together, found in his room.

'What was the purpose for the cable ties - did you imagine locking people inside a building?' he asked.

'Were they to be used to lock people inside your college?'

Piggin said he was 'not sure' why he had them and denied that they were intended for an attack.

Yet in his diary he wrote 'chain the exits' when referring to the 'operation'.

When addressing allegations that he shouted 'EDL' outside a mosque in Loughborough he said he had 'thought it was funny to have a laugh'.

Piggin also posed in a photograph doing an 'Anders Breivik salute' with one arm raised above his head and his fist clenched. 

Breivik slaughtered 77 people in Norway in July 2011. The norwegian had spent years planning the attack.

Piggin and two other 18-year-old boys, who cannot be named, have already admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bombs.

Piggin, from Loughborough, denies possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism.

He also denies possession of a document or a record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism on or before 19 February 2013.

The trial continues.
