A moose smashed through the windscreen of a packed coach as it travelled along a highway, stopping the mileage clock at the number of the beast - 666.6.

The moose unexpectedly darted into the path of the bus which travelling from the Belarus capital Minsk to the Ukrainian capital Kiev.

It was only afterwards that the police noticed the mileage clock on the bus read 666.6. 

A bus which hit a moose on a highway was left with 666.6 - the mark of the devil - on its speedometer

The moose smashed its head through the glass of the bus travelling on a highway leading from the Belarus capital Minsk to the Ukrainian capital Kiev

The digits 666 represent 'the mark of the beast' and are used by Satanists to invoke Lucifer himself.

Several passengers held a roadside service and prayed as police and fireman battled to remove the dead moose from the front of the bus.

'They thought the beast was cursed when it fact it was merely drunk,' said a police officer.

This time of year the moose in the region like to sniff out rotting fruit that has fermented and tend to consume too much which can lead to accidents like this. 

Bus driver Isaac Voronoff said: 'The thing ran straight out of the woods bordering the highway and I could not avoid hitting it. 

'I noticed the 666 on the speedometer too, but I am not a superstitious person. 

'But of the passengers on the bus heard about it they began crossing themselves right away, rattling their beads and setting up a cross at the side of the road to pray.'

Another bus had to be sent from Minsk to continue transporting the nervous passengers on their way.

It was only afterwards that the police noticed the speedometer on the bus read 666.6
