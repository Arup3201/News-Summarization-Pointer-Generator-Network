A married commercial JetBlue pilot pleaded not guilty yesterday to possession of heroin and claims he was accompanying his alleged prostitute companion on a drug run because he was 'just trying to get laid.'

John Manwaring, 42, was arraigned on a single charge for possession of heroin after police found 'a tan powder believed to be heroin' in his possession but was later released on personal recognizance by Judge Michael Coyne.

Manwaring refused to comment as he left the court room because he did not have his attorney present. He will have a retrial hearing on August 13.

High-flyer? JetBlue pilot John Manwaring, 42, pleaded not guilty for possession of heroin in court yesterday

Alleged 
prostitute Jennifer Robinson, 31, who was accused of possessing heroin 
and what may have been a crack pipe in her bra was held by probation 
officers without bail for a pending prostitution case.

WHDH/ CNN reports that according to the police report, Robinson repeatedly stated that she was buying drugs for the JetBlue pilot and not for herself. Manwaring on the other hand allegedly told police that since he is a pilot he can't use drugs and he was buying them for Robinson because he was 'just trying to get laid.'

The Boston Globe
 reports that at around 5:45 p.m. on Sunday, just hours after Manwaring 
had flown into Boston at noon, he and alleged prostitute Robinson along with four others were arrested at the intersection 
of Boylston 
and Tremont streets near the Boston Common.

It's unclear as to whether Manwaring was piloting the plane into Massachusetts or if he flew in as a passenger.

Also arrested were Braulio Valentin, 34,
 who's been charged with distribution of heroin and trespassing, Pedro 
Davilo, 36, who was charged with distribution of heroin and possession 
of cocaine, Gerardo Puchales, 26, who's been charged with intention to 
distribute cocaine near 1,000 yards of a school and trespassing and 
Abraham Ayala-Garcia, 31, who was charged with trespassing.

Police
 launched the surveillance operation around Boston Common after residents 
complained of drug dealing near the popular public park.

Co-accused: These three men were also arrested on Sunday evening in conjunction with the alleged heroin deal

Accused: Jennifer Robinson was held without bail on a pending prostitution charge

WCVB reported that Jet Blue issued a statement saying that Manwaring was removed from pilot duty on Sunday.

The
 statement reads: 'The crewmember in question was removed from duty last
 night pending the outcome of this investigation. In compliance with all
 FAA and DOT regulations and requirements, JetBlue has in place a 
rigorous drug testing program for crewmembers.'

Federal
 Aviation Administration records list a pilot by the name of John K. 
Manwaring II who is licensed to fly regional jets like the Embraer 
E-190.

JetBlue flies Embraer E-190 jets in addition to other types of planes.

Jennifer allegedly pleaded with Manwaring in the court room for him to 'get her out'
