A Ryanair jet had the top of its wing torn off yesterday after it collided with another of the company's jets while they were both taxiing to the runway.

The Boeing 737s heading to Edinburgh and Brussels ran into each other in the darkness at Dublin Airport early yesterday morning.

Passengers watched in horror and managed to take photos of the aftermath, and revealed how the tip of one plane's wing was missing.  It was left lodged in the rear wing of the plane it crashed into.
