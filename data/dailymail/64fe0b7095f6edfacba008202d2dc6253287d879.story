Costa Rica's Deputy Minister for Youth Karina Bolanos has been fired after a video of her lying on a bed in her underwear was posted on the internet.

During the 56-second video which has now been viewed by over a million people, Bolanos points at her breasts and invites a man she refers to as 'little one' to join her.

Bolanos told cable TV network CNN en Espanol the video was made years ago and was put onto the Internet by a computer engineer who stole it and was trying to extort money from her.

made her position untenable.

The incident is an embarrassment to 
President Laura Chinchilla, whose Cabinet has suffered a string of 
resignations since she took power two years ago.
