George Fessey admitted Grievous Bodily Harm without intent and was sentenced to two years in prison after throwing the teenager to the ground 'like a WWE wrestler'

A teenager had to have a titanium plate fitted in his face and be treated for epilepsy after a thug bouncer threw his body to the ground 'like a ragdoll' in a vicious attack outside a nightclub.

Rory Davis had been enjoying a night out with his friends before the incident at After Dark nightclub in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in December 2012

The 19-year-old was left with a brain haemorrhage and hole in his skull after 17-stone George Fessey slammed his body to the pavement 'like a WWE wrestler,' a court heard.

Rory, now 21, was rushed to hospital after cracking the left side of his head against the pavement. He now suffers slurred speech and receives medication for epilepsy.

Fessey was found innocent of causing Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH) with intent in a trial last year.

But the the 25-year-old was sentenced to two years in prison yesterday after having previously admitted causing GBH without intent.

Speaking during his trial last year, Fessey told Nottingham Crown Court: 'I was intending just to put him to the floor and restrain him - it went horribly wrong.'

After yesterday's hearing, Detective Inspector Phil Sims said: 'This was a classic case of adrenaline-fuelled violence and bravado, 
leading to a massive over-reaction and use of unnecessary force by one 
man against another who was half his size.

'It’s never a fair fight between someone who can lift a person above his head and body-slam him to the ground.

'George
 Fessey left his victim in the absolute lowest level of consciousness 
before death, he’s fortunate to have come out of it as well as he has.

'Not
 only was it a traumatic, life-altering ordeal for the victim, there 
were also a number of people who witnessed this, frankly 
stomach-churning, incident.

'It’s fair to say it brought an abrupt end to their festive celebrations.

'Doormen are supposed to ensure the safety of customers and diffuse potentially problematic and violent situations.

Fessey was found innocent of Grievous Bodily Harm with intent at Nottingham Crown Court last year, though was sentenced to two years imprisonment yesterday

'Fessey did the opposite. He was the problem, failing to see the boundaries of reasonable action.

'We patrol Mansfield town centre as a matter of course during the evenings and had officers nearby that night. 

'If Fessey had simply called us instead of taking the law into his own hands this whole incident could have been avoided.'

Speaking after the incident, Rory said: 'I have had a year prison sentence waiting to get my plate fitted - he will get less prison time than me. 

'It hard to say what his intent was - only he knows that.'
