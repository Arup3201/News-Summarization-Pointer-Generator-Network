Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will consider loaning Adnan Januzaj in January.

The Old Trafford club have received numerous enquires about the prospect of taking Januzaj on a temporary deal from next month.

And Van Gaal, who still believes Januzaj can make an impact at Old Trafford, is ready to contemplate the idea of allowing the 19-year-old leave next month in order to give the Belgium international more first-team experience.

Former United boss David Moyes is showing an interest in the teenager, while Inter Milan are also understood to be keen.

But Van Gaal is believed to prefer Januzaj staying in the Premier League in order for him to gain more first-team experience in England ahead of his return to United.

David Moyes gave Januzaj his breakthrough and would be interested in taking him to Real Sociedadd

Hull manager Steve Bruce, a former United defender, wants to take the talented forward on loan; while Everton are showing an interest.

Januzaj earned a new five-year contract at Old Trafford last season after bursting onto the scene under Moyes.

But the youngster has found his first-team chances limited this season with Van Gaal having a wealth of attacking option at his disposal.
