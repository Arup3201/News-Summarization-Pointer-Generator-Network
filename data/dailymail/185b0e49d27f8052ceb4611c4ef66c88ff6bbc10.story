Don't get me wrong, I am not Marouane Fellaini’s biggest fan, but if Manchester United are to win on Sunday then he is going to have a big role to play. 

You would never have believed at the start of the season that he would become United’s go-to man but he has knuckled down, worked hard and is now one of Louis van Gaal’s most effective players. 

Here’s why...

TARGET MAN

2,251 - Burnley

2,241 - QPR

2,226 - Manchester United 

United have played the third-most long balls this season, so this is not the skilful, free-flowing team of previous years. 

But with Fellaini it is an effective tactic.

He has gone up for 115 aerial duels this season — far more than any other United man — and Crystal Palace’s Mile Jedinak is the only midfielder to win more headers per game.

His power in the air is vital for providing knock-downs for the likes of Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata to collect. Liverpool must also track his runs into the box because United will try to find him as often as they can.

POWER PLAY 

One thing is for sure with Fellaini, you know you’re in a game with him. Martin Skrtel, Emre Can and Mamadou Sakho are big, physical players but they will have a battle on their hands. 

Fellaini gives away on average 2.1 free-kicks per game — that’s the fifth-highest rate in the league and shows you what a fighter he is. It’s not pretty, but it unsettles defences.

TOUCH OF CLASS 

Fellaini's game is not all about power. Like Peter Crouch, he’s portrayed as a bit of a Lurch when actually his technique is good. 

Just look at that controlled finish with his left foot to open the scoring against Tottenham.

He might not be the creative genius to win United titles, but he has become a useful weapon for Van Gaal.

FORWARD THINKING 

It was painful viewing last season seeing Fellaini play in a deep midfield role.

David Moyes wanted him as protection for his defence, but Fellaini turns like a cruise liner and it was easy for teams to press him. 

Playing further forward, it doesn’t matter if he loses possession as there is no immediate danger and he can provide an attacking threat of his own.

ELBOW ROOM

Fellaini is a real nuisance player. He’s like a daddy longlegs — all arms and legs as he wrestles and grapples to get himself into position. 

He gets his elbows up high, which makes him very difficult to mark, and it’s hard to get players around him.

It’s that physicality that would make me tempted to start Steven Gerrard on Sunday. Not for sentimental reasons, but because he would offer a vital shield against Fellaini’s threat.

Head and shoulders: Fellaini is Van Gaal’s key player
