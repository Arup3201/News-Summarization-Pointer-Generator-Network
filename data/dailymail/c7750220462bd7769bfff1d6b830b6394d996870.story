An angry mother has hit out at doctors who failed to realise that here two-year old daughter had a broken arm and sent her home saying it was just a bruise.

Joanne Hollins-Cooper, 31, took two-year-old Jessica to the NHS walk-in centre in Stoke-on-Trent after her daughter had a nasty fall at home last month.

Doctors examined the arm and diagnosed it as just a bruise and advised her to give her daughter Calpol.

After three days of no improvement in Jessica’s arm the worried mum took her to A&E at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire for a second opinion.

The young toddler underwent a series of x-rays which showed that she had shattered her arm in two places either side of her elbow.

Speaking on Sunday Joanne fumed: ‘Jessica was playing at home and running around, like every toddler does.

‘Before I knew it, she had tripped over and fallen down awkwardly. I tried to have a look but she was crying out in pain every time I touched it.

‘I was told nothing was broken and it was just badly bruised.

‘She advised us to have some rest for a couple of days and to give Jessica some Calpol for the pain.

‘At the time, I thought 'they know better than me' so I believed her when she said it wasn't broken.

‘Obviously, Jessica was very grumpy but I just put it down to her arm being sore.

‘I just cried because I felt so guilty that she had been walking around with a broken arm for all that time.

‘I had done what I thought was best and trusted the professionals.’

Little Jessica had her arm in plaster for two weeks but at a further appointment, doctors found there was still a small fracture.

She is due to go back for a further check-up in three weeks time.

Meanwhile, the family, from Weston Coyney, Staffs., have lodged a formal complaint with the walk-in centre after

Joanne revealed they still haven't apologised for their error.

She added: ‘They have not apologised to me but I have been told they are investigating.

‘I am very angry.

‘We are told to use walk-in centres rather than A&E to ease the pressure on the hospital - but look what happens when you do.'

Dr Russell Kelsey, regional medical director for Harmoni, who run the centre of behalf of the NHS, said: 'As the largest provider of out-of-hours urgent care in the country, we pride ourselves on offering the highest levels of patient care and satisfaction.

‘Any patient concern with our service is treated very seriously.

‘We are in the process of investigating this complaint and as soon as those investigations are concluded, we will share our findings with the mother.’
