Political leaders are to study an award-winning plan  to create around 3.5million new homes by expanding up to 40 towns and cities.

Planner David Rudlin was awarded the Wolfson Prize this week for his idea to double the size of existing towns and cities by building more than 80,000 homes in 'garden cities' in the green belt.

Party leaders are now said to be taking an interest in his ideas after he won the respected competition - the second biggest economics prize in the world after the Nobel Prize.

Mr Rudlin proposed expanding a fictional city he called Uxcester, loosely modelled on Oxford, using the principles of the garden city movement of the 1890s.

He says towns with existing populations of around 150,000 people could each be expanded to provide around 86,000 new homes for another 150,000 more people over the next 30 to 35 years.

Mr Rudlin says the opposition of locals to large housing developments could be overcome by concentrating the majority of new buildings in one area and protecting others

Praising his plan, prize founder Lord Wolfson of Aspley Guise, who is known to be close to chancellor George Osborne, said: 'We urgently need to build more houses and great places in Britain.

'David's entry is a tour de force of economic and financial analysis, creative thinking and bold, daring ideas.' 

Labour and the Lib Dems are believed to be keen on the idea of new garden cities to meet the spiralling demand for homes in Britain.

The plan is based around the idea of garden cities, like that built in Letchworth, Hertfordshire a century ago

George Osborne unveiled plans for a 15,000 garden city in Ebbsfleet, Kent earlier this year, but some Tories are wary of idea, fearing large house-building projects may lose them votes in rural towns and cities.

A section of the report suggesting places for expansion lists Oxford, Cambridge, Reading, Guildford, Canterbury, Ashford in Kent, Rochester, Colchester, Chelmsford, Ipswich, Norwich, Northampton, Bedford, Peterborough, Rugby, Stratford-on-Avon, Worcester, Cheltenham, Stroud, Bath, Salisbury, Winchester, Poole, Taunton, Exeter, Shrewsbury, Stafford, Chester, Preston, Blackburn, Harrogate, York, Harrogate, Lincoln, Durham and Carlisle as possible contenders.

Nearly 300 experts entered the £250,000 prize, with five finalists chosen before Mr Rudlin was announced as the winner.

A plan by homelessness charity, Shelter, to build a new garden city on the Hoo Peninsula in Medway, Kent came second.

The garden city movement arose in the late 19th century around the utopian ideas of Sir Ebenezer Howard.

The first garden cities, which featured large open spaces, wide boulevards and green belts, were built in Letchworth and Welwyn, north of London, before the idea was later copied in the US, Australia, Brazil and Argentina.
