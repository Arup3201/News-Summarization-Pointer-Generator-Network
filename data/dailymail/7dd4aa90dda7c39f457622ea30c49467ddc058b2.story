Shaving sales: The growing popularity of beards and the three-days stubble look has hit sales of Procter and Gamble grooming products

Procter and Gamble says the growing trend among men for beards and moustaches has hit their profits in the second quarter of the financial year.

Sales of its grooming products such as Gillette razors were flat but the company was hopeful that the rising popularity of male body grooming - shaving on areas other than thew face - would offset the dip in profits.

The company's chief financial officer Jon Moeller said that the growing popularity of the three-day stubble look in established markets such as America had hit sales of Gillette razors and shaving cream and Braun electric razors.

But he hoped to take advantage of the growing trend for 'manscaping'. He told AFP: 'While the incidence of facial shaving is somewhat down, the incidence of body shaving is up, and we can take advantage of that and plan to do that as well.'

The dip also coincided with 'movember' a charity scheme that encourages men to grow a moustache for the month of November.

Procter & Gamble's second-quarter net income fell 16 percent to $3.43billion as the world's largest consumer products maker also suffered from a stronger dollar and flat sales in other areas.

Sales in male grooming were flat, and sales of beauty products were down 15.5 per cent on a year ago.

But its adjusted earnings beat Wall Street expectations and the company insisted its outlook remains optimistic.

The Cincinnati-based company, whose products range from Tide detergent to Crest toothpaste and Gillette razors, is in the midst of a turnaround plan that includes focusing on its most profitable core businesses and cutting costs to save $10 billion by fiscal 2016.

Procter & Gamble, like other consumer products makers, has been trying to drive market share amid slow growth in developed markets.

Emerging markets have been a growth driver, but there have been signs that the emerging market growth rate is slowing too.

P&G said its sales results were in line with the overall consumer products market growth, from flat to up 1 percent in developed markets and up 7 to 8 percent in developing markets. Its market share growth overall was flat, and it held or grew market share in about 55 percent of its product and country categories.

Excluding restructuring costs in the latest period, earnings were $1.21 per share, a penny above expectations of analysts surveyed by FactSet.

Revenue rose less than 1 percent to $22.28 billion, short of the $22.34 billion analysts expected.

The company reiterated that it expects 3 percent to 4 percent sales growth excluding acquisitions and currency exchange, and 5 percent to 7 percent earnings per share growth, excluding one-time items.

Oppenheimer analyst Joseph Altobello said that second quarter results were largely as expected, with "reasonably healthy" sales and volume growth boosted by cost cuts.

"While encouraged by these results, we believe the necessary improvements at P&G will take time and the stock seems to already reflect further momentum," he said. He kept his "Market Perform" rating on the st

Procter and Gamble shares fell by 15 per cent to $79.18 on the news.
