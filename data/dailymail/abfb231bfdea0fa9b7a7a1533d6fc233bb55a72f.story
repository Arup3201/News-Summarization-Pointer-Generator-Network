The average price of a home will be up to £14,000 more expensive in 12 months’ time with prices rising across Britain, the Halifax said yesterday.

Amid fears the housing market is over-heating, the bank insisted there is ‘little sign of the excessive behaviour associated with a house price bubble at present.’

At present, the average price of a home is £175,000, but this is set to rise more than three times faster than typical pay rises next year.

House prices will rise ‘between four and eight per cent next year.’ By comparison, a typical private sector worker will get a 2.5 per cent pay rise.

If prices rise by eight per cent at the top end of the forecast, this would add £13,992 to the price of the average home, or just under £7,000 if they rise by only four per cent.

The Halifax said house prices will rise in all regions, rather than only taking place in London and the South East but leaving the rest of the UK in the cold.

For example, the price of a home in London’s exclusive borough of Kensington and Chelsea has rocketed to an all-time record of £1.1million, according to the Land Registry.

In the North East, prices have fallen sharply to £96,200, far below a peak of £130,000 six years ago.

Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax, said: ‘There are signs that the improvement is becoming more broadly-based with much of the country now recording price rises.

‘We expect the regional pattern to be more even in 2014 with all regions experiencing price gains.’

He dismissed fears of a housing bubble, which have been fuelled by Government-backed schemes helping people to buy homes for up to £600,000 with a deposit of just five per cent.

The lack of housebuilding is also a concern. Just 106,500 new homes were built in England last year, but the ‘required’ number is 240,000, according to the National Housing Federation.

This year, house prices have risen by nearly eight per cent. Mr Ellis said: ‘Another year of similar price rises to those in 2013 next year would not be sufficient to create a bubble.’ Before the credit crunch struck, house prices were rising considerably faster than they are today, he said.

In August 1999, the average home cost £78,959. Eight years later in August 2007 - the month that the credit crunch began - prices were 150 per cent higher, reaching their peak of £199,612.

The Halifax’s forecast follows a series of house price forecasts in recent weeks which have predicted that house prices will rise sharply over the next few years.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors predicts house price will rise by eight per cent in 2014, although it expects there will be significant regional variations.

In London, prices will rise by 11 per cent, the fastest of the UK regions, compared to only four per cent in Northern Ireland, the smallest rise.

Peter Bolton King, global residential director of RICS, said: ‘While the number of new homes being built is now on the rise, it still won’t be anywhere near enough to meet demand.

‘We expect the problem of insufficient housing stock to be the main driver behind price increases over the next twelve months.’ Around 400,000 people in Britain are ‘property millionaires’, a record number, according to a recent report by the property website Zoopla.co.uk.

The National Housing Federation recently warned the situation is ‘dysfunctional’, adding: ‘England’s housing market is broken.’
