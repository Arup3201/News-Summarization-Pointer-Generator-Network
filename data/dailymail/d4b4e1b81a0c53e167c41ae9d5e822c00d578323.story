A 38-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and two others detained after shots were fired at police in Belfast during violent protests.

A water cannon was fired at a group of more than 100 protestors, who attacked police officers with bricks, smoke bombs and fireworks in the eastern area of the city.

Unionist demonstrators have been protesting following a decision to limit the number of days on which the Union flag is flown at Belfast City Hall.

A further four men have been charged with a number of public order offences and will appear before at Belfast Magistrates' Court tonight.

Three of the men were arrested on Friday night, while another was arrested following rioting this afternoon. Two other men remain in police custody.

More than 1,000 demonstrators had 
marched on at the landmark earlier in the afternoon, but despite tense 
scenes the rally passed off without major incident.

There
was a heavy police presence, including officers in riot gear with dogs,
stationed within city hall itself and on surrounding side streets.

But as the flag-waving crowds dispersed, ugly scenes erupted on the Newtownards Road in the traditionally unionist east of the city.

A section of the Newtownards Road - between Bridgend and Hollywood Arches - was shut down because of the sporadic disorder. There were no immediate reports of any police injuries.

18 people were arrested after nine 
police officers were injured in Northern Ireland last night as part of the protests. There were also reports on TV that shots were fired.

More than 30 petrol bombs, along with
fireworks, ball bearings and masonry, were hurled at police officers in
a sustained attack on officers in east Belfast last night. Up to 300 
people were involved in the disturbances.

Rioting
began a month ago after a vote by mostly nationalist pro-Irish 
councillors to end the century-old tradition of flying the British flag 
from Belfast City Hall every day unleashed the most sustained period of 
violence in the city for years.

Response: The police water cannon is used to douse smouldering debris on a street in Belfast

Under fire: Police officers came under fire in East Belfast, according to reports

Demonstrations: More than 1,000 people marched outside Belfast City Hall earlier today without incident

Destruction: Burning debris blocks the Newtownards Road in East Belfast

Three attempted vehicle hijackings 
were made in the Beersbridge Road area. A business premises on the 
O'Neill Road was also broken into by several masked men, who damaged the
property and stole a sum of money.

The PSNI said they will be seeking 
further arrests in the coming days in relation to the disorder and have 
appealed for witnesses.

Conall
McDevitt, SDLP policing spokesman, said those organising the 
demonstrations on social media must be held fully responsible for the 
resultant violence.

'I 
appeal for calm today and over the weekend and ask people taking part in
protests to reflect upon the violence and ask themselves if they want 
to be associated with that violence and if that is the best way that 
they feel they can have their voice heard,' he added.

'Nobody is in doubt that some 
paramilitaries are exploiting these illegal protests to destabilise the 
situation and ultimately bring violence back on to our streets.'

Flag protests: Several police officers were injured during loyalist violence in Northern Ireland over the right to fly the Union Flag

Attack: Police in east Belfast were dealing with serious public disorder in the Castlereagh Street and Templemore Avenue areas last night

Last night, Stormont First Minister 
Peter Robinson said violence against the police was a 'disgrace' and 
those behind days of unrest were playing into the hands of dissident 
republicans.

On Thursday 10 police officers were 
injured in East Belfast during a demonstration against the decision to 
reduce the number of days the union flag is flown from Belfast city 
hall.

'All right-thinking unionists will 
want to channel their energies into political activity and to support 
the cause of finding political solutions to the problems that we face,' 
Mr Robinson said.

'In Northern Ireland the ballot box has primacy and is the only vehicle for choosing the people's representatives.'
