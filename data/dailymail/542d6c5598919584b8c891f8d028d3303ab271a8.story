A streaker sparked a mass brawl after running on to the pitch at a rugby match to tackle an opposition player. 

The match between Newcastle University and Northumbria was coming to an end when the man, whose identity is not known, wandered on to the pitch with no clothes on. 

After lining himself up to catch the ball for Northumbria, he tackled a Newcastle player to the ground to rapturous applause at Kingston Park.

After lining himself up with Northumbria, the prankster made a tackle towards an opposition player 

But within seconds players from opposing teams started fighting, leaving the streaker able to make a quick exit without getting caught up in the scuffle. 

Tongan international rugby player Willis Koloofai said: 'I’ve played a lot of rugby, but I’ve never seen anything like this before. 

'The guy had so much time on the pitch, about 4 minutes to do what he wanted!

'The atmosphere was pretty good in the stadium as you’d expect between two rival universities, but when he ran on, it got even more charged - it was so entertaining.

'He lined up as if he belonged there as Northumbria’s 16th man, crouched down on his knees. Then as the ball came near him, he executed a textbook tackle on the Newcastle kid!

The practical joke was filmed by a spectator who said he had never seen anything like it before

'Then there was just a massive rumble between the two teams - Newcastle were probably a bit annoyed at the extra defence that Northumbria suddenly had!

'I was watching it with some of the Falcons boys and we found it hilarious - we had no idea where the security was though.'

Eventually, play was resumed, with Northumbria running out 29-10 winners to continue their good form over their arch rivals.
