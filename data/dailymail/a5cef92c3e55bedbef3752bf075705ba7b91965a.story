Thousands of Iraqi women and girls have been trafficked out of the country for sexual exploitation since the U.S. invasion in 2003 (file picture)

Thousands of women and girls have been trafficked out of Iraq for sexual exploitation since the U.S. invasion in 2003.

The findings, by the Social Change for Education in the Middle East (SCEME), say the victims are being transported to neigbouring Middle Eastern countries, most notably to Syria and Jordan, but also as far afield as Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

A report entitled Karamatuna (Our Dignity) highlights the plight of young Iraqi refugee women and girls since the downfall of Saddam Hussein.

While it remains unknown just how many female refugees have been subjected to sex trafficking, according to the Iraqi NGO the Organisation for Women’s Freedom in Iraq, 4,000 women, one fifth of whom are under 18, disappeared in the first seven years since the invasion.

Clinical researcher Iman Abou-Atta acknowledges sexual exploitation existed in Iraq long before the invasion, but told a hearing at London’s House of Lords ahead of publication that the war and instability that followed ‘led to an environment where young women and girls became much more vulnerable to trafficking.’

As well as sex trafficking by criminal gangs, family members are also known to have become involved in the phenomena, with sales and forced marriages prevalent to overcome economic hardship, resolve disputes and pay debts.

The report suggests the majority of young girls and women are targeted while still inside Iraqi borders, many of whom have left their families because of fear, abuse, threats of forced marriage or violence.

Kidnappings also take place with research revealing taxi drivers are often used to entrap victims with promises of help.

It cites experiences by young Iraqi women, including that of 17-year-old Amira, who was ‘sold’ by her father to a man who offered the family $200 a month to supposedly take care of his handicapped wife.

As well as housework, the teenager was forced to have sexual intercourse with the son, and friends of the man who hired her.

The story of Nada, who was sold to an Iraqi gang by her prostitute mother after her father was killed, is equally harrowing, albeit with a happier ending.

Kidnappings are common and trafficking women is a profitable business in Iraq

The 17-year-old was taken to Jordan where she was gang-raped by four men. She managed to escape and return to Iraqi where an Iraqi family helped her get a new passport from the immigration department.

The report is critical of the fact Iraq has no procedures in place to identify and prosecute traffickers. Nor does it offer official protection to victims – many of whom find themselves punished for crimes committed as a result of trafficking, including forced prostitution.

Hakary Dzayi, of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Centre (TraCCC) confirmed: ‘Those in power expedite the way for traffickers because trafficking in females has a big profit, the good bribes motivate them to not follow the cases of the trafficked women.’

In conclusion, the report calls for help from the international community and for more research to help put figures on the number of women and girls being trafficked out of the country. 

It welcomes the growing focus on women’s rights in light of the Arab Spring, but warns of the increasing instability across the region and its potential to exacerbate the problem.

Pledging to further the cause of victims, it adds: ‘Trafficked and prostituted women and girls are victims of poverty, conflict and violence.

'They are not criminals and do not constitute a threat to society, and rather than being punished as offenders by unjust judicial systems, they must be protected.

‘Where laws exist to protect them, then officials must be trained because without a fundamental shift to full application of protective legislation, sex-trafficking will continue.
