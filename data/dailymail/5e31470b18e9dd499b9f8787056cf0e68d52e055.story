Andy Murray pulled off the most emphatic Wimbledon win of his career to the screams and whoops of a star-studded crowd.

Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, jumped up from her seat as the Scotsman powered past Slovenia's Blaz Rola into the third round.

Meanwhile, his girlfriend Kim Sears looked quietly emotional, giving him a standing ovation as he was cheered off the court.

The defending champion was in sublime form on Court One, needing just an hour and 24 minutes to seal a win with 6-1 6-1 6-0.

Spectators including Gabby Roslin and Sol Campbell also shouted their support from the sunny stands in SW19 today.

Murray had never previously dropped fewer than six games in a match at the All England Club, while it was his most one-sided result at a slam since losing one game to Alberto Martin at the Australian Open in 2007.

Rola's hopes of mounting the most unlikely of comebacks were dealt another blow at the start of the third set.

Easy: The swift game was one of Murray's most emphatic wins of his Wimbledon career just after starting training with his new coach

Passionate: Avid tennis fan Camilla looked animated as she reacted to Murray's powerful play

The coach: Amelie Mauresmo looked tense but confident as she watched her player perform a quality match in a bid to retain his title

Excited: Kim clapped, whooped and beamed with the crowds, standing at the end to see him off the court with a standing ovation

Having missed two break points, Murray played a stunning rally to move 1-0 ahead, ending it with a crisp forehand winner down the line.

The 27-year-old was in complete control, showing off all facets of his game and giving Rola a thorough runaround.

The Slovenian continued to have the odd glimpse on the Murray serve and created a third break point of the match at 3-0, but it went the same way as the others.

Rola then served successive double faults to leave Murray serving for the match, and he clinched it with a love game, ending on a delightful drop shot.

Greetings: Before taking her seat, a canary yellow Camilla greeted Britain's Laura Robson, Andy Murray's doubles partner

Murray said: 'I played well. This is the first year he's played on grass. He just came out of college and he's broken into the top 100 so it was tough for him.

'He doesn't have much grass-court experience but he'll definitely keep improving because he's got a good game.

'I just had to concentrate on my side of the net and I took care of my serve pretty well throughout the majority of the match.'

Left-hander Rola had lost twice to British number three James Ward in the last month, at the French Open and Queen's, so was not expected to trouble Murray.

And Rola's nerves were obvious as he allowed Murray to break serve in the opening game, throwing in a double fault and a number of mis-hits.

Coffee break: Earlier, Andy's mum Judy excited queuing spectators by handing out coffees in purple and green Wimbledon cups

Murray has a famously excellent record against left-handers - Rafael Nadal aside - which is a legacy of growing up playing against his brother Jamie.

Next up he faces a match against either 27th seed Roberto Bautista-Agut or Czech Jan Hernych.

Murray said he expected high marks from Mauresmo for his display.

'I'm sure she'll be happy with it,' he said.

'We'll have a chat about the match this afternoon and then rest up and get ready for the next round.

'It's been a good start.'
