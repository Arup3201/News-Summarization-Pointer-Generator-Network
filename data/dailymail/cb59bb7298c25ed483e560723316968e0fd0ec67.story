A couple were left fuming after their trim-looking five-year-old was branded overweight by school health officials - and they insist she won't be going on a diet.

Ann and Matt James were amazed to be told their daughter Lily was too heavy after she was weighed as part of national child health checks.

They said she was on the go 'non-stop' and was so small she wore clothes made for younger children.

Trim: Little Lily James, who is five, has been branded overweight by school health officials despite weighing just 3st 3lbs. Her parents say she is 'on-the-go' non stop and wears clothes made for younger children

'I was hopping mad when I read the letter,' said Mrs James. 'My friends were appalled a letter like this could be sent out.'

The couple have called the verdict a 'joke' and challenged anyone looking at pictures of their daughter to say she looked unhealthy.

Mr James, a house husband, added: 'There’s no way Lily is overweight. She’s very active and is on the go non-stop with her trampolining, running around and swimming.

'She will be six in November but still wears clothes for four to five-year-olds.'

The couple also vowed not to put their daughter, a reception pupil at Green Meadow Primary in Selly Oak, Birmingham, on a diet for fear of sparking eating disorders in later life.

Advice: A copy of the letter the school sent Lily's parents telling them she is 'in the overweight range' and explaining that there are 'small changes' they could make to help her eat well and be more active

Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS 
Trust, which weighed Lily as part of the National Child Measurement 
Programme, would not comment on her case but insisted the initiative was
a useful tool in fighting Britain’s rising weight problem.

This isn't the first time parents of children who appear to be a healthy weight have been told their little ones are too fat.

In April, the parents of Lacie-May Gray, the smallest
in her class, were warned of the 'serious implications' of her weight in
a stern letter from NHS bosses.

The four-year-old, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, weighs just 3st 7lb.

In the same month, the same thing 
happened to four-year-old Sophie Kettle, from High Wycombe, 
Buckinghamshire, who was declared 'obese' despite weighing just 2st 
13lbs.

The latest row 
began when Mr James, 34, and Mrs James, 31, were sent a letter saying 
Lily was 3ft 5ins tall and weighed 3st 3lbs.

According
to the Body Mass Index Centile - the chart used to assess a child’s 
weight and growth pattern - she had a score of 91, putting her in the 
overweight category for her age and height.

The letter went on to offer the couple a list of healthy eating and exercise schemes they could enrol her on.

The
couple said Lily had a healthy diet of porridge for breakfast, fruit 
mid-morning and then at school she had a cooked meal of meat and two 
vegetables.

'She isn’t interested in pizza or junk food and prefers brown bread to white, hardly ever has sweets or cakes and when we had a barbecue recently only ate half a burger,' Mr James said.

The National Child Measurement 
Programme was set up in 2005 and brackets reception class and Year 6 
pupils according to whether they are underweight, healthy, overweight or
obese.

Latest figures, 
released last December for the 2010/11 school year, showed a rising 
trend of obese Year 6 pupils - those aged ten or 11.

A total of 19 per cent of Year 6 children were classed as obese, up from 18.7 per cent in 2009/10 and 17.5 per cent in 2006/7.

But
the proportion of reception children who were obese in 2010/11 fell to 
9.4 per cent; against 9.8 per cent in 2009/10 and 9.9 per cent in 
2006/07.

Mrs James said: 'There’s no way I’m putting Lily on a diet. That will make her grow up with an eating disorder and turn her anorexic.'

A health trust spokesman said every child was weighed and measured in their reception class and again in Year 6.

'Today, one in three children aged between two and ten is overweight,' he said. 'The gradual increase in the number of children who are overweight means society has collectively become used to it. So it can be difficult to tell whether an individual child is clinically overweight as they may look similar to other children of their age.

'Research shows that if a child is 
overweight now, they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an 
adult, which can lead to health problems in later life.

'So the measurements are an important way of checking how a child is growing at crucial stages of their development.'

NHS
Information Centre chief executive Tim Straughan said: 'More than a 
million children in England are measured as part of the National Child 
Measurement Programme.

'It shows that, while the proportion of four-to-five year olds who are obese has fallen, the opposite has happened among ten and 11-year-olds.'
