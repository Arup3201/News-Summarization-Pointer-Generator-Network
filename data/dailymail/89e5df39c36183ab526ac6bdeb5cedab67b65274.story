Fine: Chinese film director Zhang Yimou, is facing a £100 million lawsuit, after being accused of fathering seven children

One of China's most celebrated film directors is facing a £100million fine after allegedly violating the country's controversial one-child policy by fathering seven children.

Zhang Yimou, who directed hit movies House of Flying Daggers and Hero as well as the opening and closing ceremonies at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, has admitted having two sons and a daughter with his current wife and a daughter with his ex wife.

But rumours have been circulating for several months that he has had three more children other women.

A lawsuit was sent to the 
Intermediate People's Court in Wuxi on Thursday, the hometown of Zhang's
wife, half in compensation for public resources, and half in 
punitive damages.

Guo
Chengxi, one of the lawyers behind the action, confirmed reports that it demands a total of one billion yuan 
($100million) adding they decided to take action 
against Zhang because he 'represents a typical case' of an elite trying 
to skirt the law.

She said: 'Right
now, in China, this phenomenon of wealthy people having more than one 
child is very serious,'

Jia
Fangyi, the other lawyer, was quoted in the government-run China Daily as saying the actions of wealthy 
people such as Zhang were 'unfair to the poor and those who strictly 
follow the national policy'.

'The
rich have become increasingly audacious by violating the family 
planning policy just because they are rich enough to pay the fine... and
they take an extra share of resources from society,'

The court might not accept the case, the newspaper added.

Amid increasing pressure - including a 
Nanjing newspaper's publication last month of a front-page 'wanted' 
poster seeking information on his whereabouts - Zhang finally issued an 
apology on Sunday through his studio's microblogging account.

Controversial: China's one-child policy was put in place to 
control China's booming population, and officials say it has been key to
the country's rising prosperity

Critics
say China's late-1970s family-planning law, which restricts most 
couples to one child, is selectively and sometimes brutally enforced, 
while the wealthy and well-connected are easily able to pay the fines 
levied for extra offspring.

But
in recent days some users of China's popular online social networks 
have directed their anger at the policy itself, rather than Zhang, with 
some hoping the attention heaped on his case may hasten the eventual 
demise of the law, which authorities have recently moved to relax.

The
policy was put in place to control China's booming population, and 
officials say it has been key to the country's rising prosperity.

But
opposition to it has steadily grown among members of the public as well
as among demographic experts, who warn that it has led to a decline in 
China's working-age population and a swelling of the ranks of the 
elderly that could bring about a labour shortage within the next two 
decades.

Those fears appear to be shared by 
China's Communist Party leaders, who after a key meeting in Beijing last
month moved to expand the exceptions to the policy to allow couples to 
have two children if one of the parents is an only child.

Talent: Many of Zhang Yimou's films, such as the 2002 hit Hero (pictured) have proved popular with audiences in the West as well as China

Spectacular: Zhang Yimou masterminded the breath-taking opening and closing ceremonies at the 2008 Beijing Olympics

In the past Chinese web users have typically responded with fury to reports of celebrities escaping the one-child regulation, but sentiments over the past week have been more mixed, with some citing Zhang as an example of why the law should be scrapped.

'We should be grateful to Zhang Yimou!' one posted on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter. 'Thanks to his popularity, he's made the whole society debate the problems of the 'family planning policy'! This might help speed up the abolition of this draconian law.'

Another said the controversy was 'more than ridiculous', adding: 'Procreating is a fundamental human instinct and a way of passing things on to future generations. Here in China, it's actually become a crime.'

In 2012, 24 of the country's 31 provinces and regions collected a total of nearly 20 billion yuan in penalties, the Beijing News reported Thursday. None of the provincial authorities has detailed how the money was spent.
