Monarch is to introduce non-reclining seats across its entire fleet of planes.

The light-weight design, to be rolled out this summer, has been launched to create more ‘living space’ for passengers after customer research showed the existing style was unpopular.

It comes after surveys revealed that nine in ten travellers wanted reclining seats banned, and voted them one of the most common causes of mid-flight anger.

Feedback: Monarch said the design was launched after passengers were unhappy with reclining seats

Using light-weight materials that also achieve ‘significant’ savings on fuel emissions, Monarch, which flies from six UK bases including Gatwick, said the new seats offer passengers more legroom.

It also includes a tablet holder for the technology-savvy holidaymaker, which the airline called ‘an aviation first’. 

The new, non-reclining thinner design is similar to that used in the automotive industry.

Tim Williamson, Director of Customer Experience and Marketing, said: ‘Our new ergonomic seats have been designed with our customers’ needs in the forefront of our minds.

‘The new non-reclining design gives our customers far more “living space” than traditional seats, without the fear of the person in front impinging on their personal space.’

He added that as customer feedback had rated seat storage as high importance, the new non-reclining plane seats offer more flexibility than traditional ‘pockets’ – and can ‘comfortably’ fit water bottles, jackets and children’s toys.

In terms of fuel savings, when compared to Monarch’s existing seats, a set of the new designs a flight to Egypt saves 255kg fuel - equivalent to 816kg of carbon dioxide saved on a single flight, according to the airline.

Mr Williamson said: ‘Monarch will introduce the new seats across our fleet this summer.

‘Our customer research indicated that the reclining feature of standard seats was not popular, and unnecessary, on a short haul flight.

‘Monarch's new non-reclining design ensures that all our customers enjoy a comfortable journey without the seat in front encroaching on their space, together with additional leg room.

‘The integrated tablet holder is also a first in the industry, allowing customers to relax and enjoy the content on their tablets, e-readers or smartphones without having to hold their devices or “prop” them up against the seat in front.

‘Extensive research has been undertaken throughout the development process, examining aspects including the optimum amount of padding and seat angle, and the end result is a carefully-crafted ergonomic design delivering both optimum comfort and practical features that our customers will appreciate.’

The announcement from Monarch, the UK’s longest-established airline which also flies from Manchester and Birmingham, comes after a Skyscanner survey last year revealed 90 per cent of travellers wanted reclining seats banned.

In a separate survey, CabinCrew.com found more than 60 per cent of international cabin crew had seen an argument between passengers over reclining seats.

Lightweight seats will save 562lb of fuel on a five-hour flight, equivalent to 1,799lb of carbon dioxide.

Monarch has trailled prototypes over the past 11 months, but the updated version features extra padding in line with customer feedback.

One customer wrote on MailOnline yesterday: ‘I have already sat in those new seats and have to say they were surprisingly comfortable. More leg room too – this is a winner!’

But another added: ‘Not comfortable at all! It was like sitting on a wooden chair.’

Budget airline Ryanair scrapped reclining seats in 2003 and EasyJet followed suit four years later.
