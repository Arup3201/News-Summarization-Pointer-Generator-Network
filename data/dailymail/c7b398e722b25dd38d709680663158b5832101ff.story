Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are part of an 11-strong 'task force' created to examine all aspects of the US Ryder Cup process in the wake of last month's defeat at Gleneagles.

But the man praised by Mickelson as creating a winning formula, 2008 captain Paul Azinger, has turned down the chance to formally take part.

In a statement on their website, the PGA of America said the task force would examine the selection of Ryder Cup captains and vice-captains, the qualifying system, the dates by which the team is determined and the timing of wild card selections.

2012 - Medinah: USA 13½ Europe 14½

2010 - Celtic Manor: Europe 14½ USA 13½

2008 - Valhalla: USA 16½ Europe 11½

2006 - The K Club: Europe 18½ USA 9½

2004 - Oakland Hills: USA 9½ Europe 18½

2002 - The Belfry: Europe 15½ USA 12½

1999 - Brookline: USA 14½ USA 13½

1997 - Valderrama: Europe 14½ USA 13½

1995 - Oak Hill: USA 13½ Europe 14½ 

'The Ryder Cup is our most prized competitive asset and the PGA of America is committed to utilising our utmost energy and resources to support one of the biggest events in all of sport,' PGA of America president Ted Bishop said.

'The Ryder Cup Task Force, co-chaired by (PGA vice president) Derek Sprague and (PGA chief executive officer) Pete Bevacqua, is an exciting and comprehensive initiative that will guide the PGA in developing the right strategy and building ongoing processes and infrastructure for future generations of US teams.'

In addition to Sprague and Bevacqua, the members of the task force are former captains Raymond Floyd, Tom Lehman and Davis Love, former players Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Mickelson, Steve Stricker and Woods and PGA secretary Paul Levy.

Woods, who was not part of the team in Gleneagles, said: 'I think this is a great step by the PGA to accomplish what we all want - to win the Ryder Cup.

'The Ryder Cup is very important to every player who has the honour to represent his country. I'm excited to be part of this group.'

Azinger is the only man to lead the United States to victory in the biennial contest this century and his approach was hailed by Mickelson in the US team's press conference in the immediate aftermath of the five-point loss in Scotland. The 43-year-old Californian also made implied - but strong - criticism of Tom Watson's leadership at Gleneagles in his comments.

Azinger, 54, has not ruled out being captain for a second time but did not want to be part of the task force.

'I think Paul felt more comfortable with us talking in a small setting,' Bevacqua was quoted as saying by the Golf Channel.

Lee Westwood, who made his ninth Ryder Cup appearance at Gleneagles, hailed the creation of the task force as positive news for Europe.

'What a massive pat on the back & confidence booster it is for Europe that team USA needs to create a Ryder Cup task force!!!' the former world No 1 wrote on Twitter.

'Maybe because Paul Azinger is not on this task force means he's in the frame for the next captaincy. Must be something the TF is discussing.'
