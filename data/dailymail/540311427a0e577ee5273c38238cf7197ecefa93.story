Imagine browsing through photos of animals and being able to stroke them through your phone’s screen, or ‘feel’ products before you buy them online. 

Japanese firm Fujitsu has developed a prototype tablet that uses ultrasound vibrations to mimic a variety of textures. 

These vibrations change the friction between the finger and the screen to trick the brain into thinking it’s plucking a harp, touching the skin of an alligator and more.

The Japanese firm has developed the prototype tablet device usING ultrasound vibrations to mimic a variety of textures. 

These
 vibrations change the friction between the finger and the screen to 
trick the brain into thinking it’s plucking a harp, touching the skin of
 an alligator and more.

It can also give the sensation of a slippery liquid.

Other, similar technologies change the 
friction between the finger and the screen using static electricity, and
 Fujitsu claim the use of ultrasound is a world first.

It is also a breakthrough technology 
because ultrasound vibrations usually need a large amount of energy to 
work effectively. This is the first time it’s been developed to run on 
smaller devices with mobile batteries.

Disney Research developed a similar 
system in October that uses an algorithm for 2D touchscreens that 
modifies the friction between a user's finger and the screen to add 
physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at.

The company claims that it can reproduce edges, ridges, protrusions and bumps as well as other sensations using its technology.

Fujitsu said: ‘While technologies already exist that convey texture by vibrating the touchscreen display panel itself or by generating static electricity, Fujitsu Laboratories has developed the industry's first technology to use ultrasonic vibrations to convey tactile sensations by varying the friction between the touchscreen display and the user's finger. 

‘This technology enables tactile sensations – either smooth or rough, which had until now been difficult to achieve – right on the touchscreen display.

'Users can enjoy realistic tactile sensations as they are applied to images of objects displayed on the screen.’

By varying the ultrasonic vibrations, using a layer beneath the screen, this reduces friction and creates what Fujitsu calls a ‘floating effect.’

To create a ‘bumpy or rough’ touch sensation, the prototype table quickly switches between high and low friction, in response to where the fingers are placed on the screen

This tricks the brain into think the screen is slippery, and mimics liquid.

This combination of tactile information, visual information from the display, and audio information from the speakers can trick the brain into thinking it’s touching something physical.

Disney researchers have worked with a different technology to create a similar effect. They used an algorithm for 2D touchscreens that modify the friction between a user's finger and the screen to add physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at. Disney Research said the technology can be used to feel soft, fragile features (pictured)

Examples demonstrated by Fujitsu include a Japanese harp, which gives users the sensation of plucking the strings of a koto, a traditional Japanese harp.

The DJ demonstration gives the impression that users are touching a CD placed on a mixing deck, using volume and other controls as if they were physical buttons. 

As a user turns the lock in the Vault demonstration, sound and tactile feedback gives the illusion of turning a combination lock on a safe.

One key feature of Disney's algorithm is that it can be implemented in real-time. A 3D model of objects (like the kettle seen here) can be zoomed and panned in real-time to sense fine edge and protruding features of the object

While the Alligator demonstration gives the sensation of touching the skin of a real-life alligator. 

Fujitsu continued: ‘By enabling more realistic and intuitive operability, the tactile sensory technology in this prototype has wide-ranging potential applications, including for electronic product catalogues, on tablets and other devices.’

The technology could lead to textured maps where users can feel tall mountains, new apps for visually impaired people and more interactive touchscreen games.

The firm aims to develop the prototype further, and increase the amount touch sensations, before making it available to buy in 2015.
