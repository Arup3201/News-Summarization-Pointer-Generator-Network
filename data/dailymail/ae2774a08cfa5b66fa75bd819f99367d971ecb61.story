Despite Dr Spencer's activities, he told listeners: 'I want to repeat what I said last night: There is no cause for alarm,' according to CBS New York.

'New Yorkers who have not been exposed to an infected person's bodily fluids are simply not at risk. It's crucial to emphasize, it's not an airborne disease, it's not a casual contact disease.'

The 30-year-old, who has not yet shown any signs or symptoms of Ebola, is now under mandatory quarantine for 21 days, the virus's incubation period.

Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said.
