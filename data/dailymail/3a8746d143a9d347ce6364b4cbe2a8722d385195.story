As a comedian, he should probably have learnt when to give up on a joke.

But instead of making amends for his jibe about Hillsborough, Alan Davies has dug himself in deeper – by joking that he wanted to dress up as a ‘comedy Scouser’.

The 46-year-old received death threats after he mocked Liverpool Football Club’s refusal to play on the anniversary of the 1989 disaster, out of respect for the 96 fans who died.

He apologised for the remarks – only to aggravate the situation yesterday by poking fun at Liverpudlians.

Risk: Despite enduring a barrage of insults and death threats, Alan Davies joked on Twitter about disguising himself in a costume (right) inspired by Harry Enfield's Liverpudlian stereotypes

Critics have accused Davies of deliberately making the controversial remarks to create ‘free publicity’ as he prepares to go on tour for the first time in 12 years.

After receiving a barrage of abuse on Twitter for the comments he made about Hillsborough on Tuesday, he wrote yesterday: ‘Going out later. I’ve decided to get a disguise.’

He then posted a link to a fancy dress costume of a ‘comedy Scouser’ including a 1980s shell suit, permed wig and bushy moustache.

The £33.98 ensemble is modelled on a sketch from television show Harry Enfield and Chums, in which caricatured Liverpudlians use stereotypical phrases such as ‘Eh, eh!’ and ‘Calm down, calm down!’

But his joke certainly did not have a calming effect on the Hillsborough furore.

Russ McNally said it was wrong to apologise and then ‘reply with this stereotypical jibe’, while Megan Worrall said, ‘That really isn’t funny. You’re digging a hole. Why mock others’ right to commemorate tragedy. #noheart.’

Lia Kelly wrote: ‘Digging a hole so deep he’s en route to China.’

On The Tuesday Club football podcast, Davies ranted about Liverpool’s insistence on playing Merseyside rivals Everton in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday, rather than on the anniversary of Hillsborough the following day, April 15.

It means Chelsea must play their semi-final with Tottenham on the Sunday, just three days before their Champions League match with Barcelona.

Davies said: ‘Liverpool and the 15th – that gets on my t*ts that s***. What are you talking about “We won’t play on the day”? Why can’t they?’

He went on: ‘Do Man United play on the date of Munich? Do Rangers play on the date when all their fans died in that disaster whatever year that was – 1971?’ He received a furious backlash on Twitter, including dozens of death threats.

The comic is due to appear at the Liverpool Empire Theatre on September 23 as part of his Life is Pain tour – his first stand-up dates for 12 years.

One man wrote on Twitter: ‘Alan Davies causes a media storm and now I 
know he’s doing a stand up tour soon, strange that 
#missionaccomplished.’

Another posted: ‘Obviously trying to revive a 
flagging career by being a vile and ignorant human being to gain 
publicity.’

Steve Kelly, who is a spokesman for the Hillsborough Justice Campaign 
and lost his brother, Michael, 38, in the tragedy, said: ‘The comments, 
coming as they have so close to the anniversary, will cause so much hurt
to the families.

‘To say on Twitter that he is going out in disguise is just pouring petrol on the fire.’

By way of apology for his remarks, Davies tried to make a £1,000 
donation to The Hillsborough Justice Campaign, but the charity refused 
to accept it.

He also tried to defend himself on Twitter, saying: ‘I don’t find Hillsborough “funny”.

‘Holy smoke, this venom towards me is now absolutely ludicrous. I have apologised for the tone I took.’

Last night, his agent Lucy Fairney said he would not be talking to the press because he was ‘letting it all die down’.
