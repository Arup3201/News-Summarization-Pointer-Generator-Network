Sir Cliff's calendar has dropped out of the top ten best-seller list for the first time, figures from online retailer Amazon revealed

It has been a guaranteed stocking filler for his army of fans for three decades.

But after years of winning the alternative battle for Christmas No.1 without contention, Sir Cliff Richard’s annual calendar has suffered a slump in popularity.

For his traditional collection of portraits has fallen out of the top ten best-sellers for the first time.

The pop star has had a torrid year in which he suffered ‘enormous, irreparable damage to his reputation’ after the BBC broadcast live footage of a police raid on his home.

Despite varying fortunes in the pop charts, the 74-year-old’s calendar has remained a constant source of success and income for the singer.

His position at the top of the chart has only changed in the last three years due to the huge popularity of boyband One Direction, who have broken Sir Cliff’s calendar sales record.

Sir Cliff remained the second highest selling celebrity calendar behind the band last year but has fallen out of the top ten for the first time this Christmas.

Figures from online retailer Amazon reveal Sir Cliff has once again been outsold by One Direction and fellow pop group 5 Seconds of Summer.

Pop stars Cheryl Cole, Olly Murs and Robbie Williams have also sold more calendars than the veteran singer so far this year.

Olympic diver Tom Daley and Hollywood star Benedict Cumberbatch usurped Sir Cliff as more popular choices on the walls of the nation, with the pop star languishing as the 11th most popular choice.

Since his £3.1million Berkshire apartment was raided as part of a historic child sex abuse investigation, Sir Cliff also suffered a ‘significant drop’ in the number of times his songs were played on the radio.

An analysis of radio airplay using figures from Radio Monitor earlier this month found that his airplay had dropped by around 65 per cent in the last three months.

The research suggests his reputation has been damaged by the public revelations about the search but Sir Cliff has strongly denied the accusations as ‘completely false’..

Although he was interviewed under caution, he was not arrested or charged and continues to deny any wrongdoing.

Last year the so-called Peter Pan of pop suggested he might end the 35-year tradition of his annual calendar, prompting complaints from fans.

Acknowledging that time was catching up with him, he said: ‘I think the reason why the rumours got out that I’m not going to do any more is probably because it’s true.

‘No, not completely. You have hit the nail on the head - how many shapes can I pull with this body?’

The 73-year-old appears relaxed and upbeat in the pictures, which show him enjoying a Summer Holiday lifestyle in Barbados, where he has a home.

But he backtracked on the possible move and posed for a series of pictures in Barbados, where he has a home, in which he appears relaxed and upbeat.

The singer has sold more than 1.5million calendars in the last three decades.

Amazon’s Darren Hardy said last year: ‘Before 2011, no one could get near Cliff Richard at the top of the calendar charts but One Direction’s unrivalled popularity has seen them shoot to the top of the annual bestsellers list for the third year running.’
