Carol Robertson, a golf coach at Virginia Tech University sunk two holes-in-one within the span of three holes on March 9 in Orlando, Florida

A Virginia Tech University golf coach accomplished a golf feat that is so rare, she was just as likely to win the lottery.

Carol Robertson, 30, sank two holes-in-one in the space of three holes on March 9. 

Her successful game of golf came during a practice round at Celebration Golf Club near Orlando, Florida, while the university was on spring break. 

The odds of sinking two holes-in-one in the same round are 67million-to-one, according to PGA.com. 

But US Hole in One, estimated the odds of sinking aces on consecutive par-three holes at nearly 156,250,000 to one, according to the Washington Post. That's roughly the same odds as winning the Powerball lottery. 

The first hole in one came on the third hole, a 159-yard par-three. The second was on hole five, a 161-yard par-three. 

Before the fifth hole, she joked that she plays 'par threes pretty fast' and she she'd 'just go ahead and make a one on this one, too', according to the Washington Post.

And then she did. 

'I just kind of dropped my club and hit the ground,' Robertson said. 'Everybody's just high-fiving, getting their cameras out, taking pictures.'

The ball landed to the left when it hit the putting green, but it began to roll and headed right for the hole. And then it sunk.

'It was like slow  motion, watching that one go in,' Robertson told Washington Post. 'We couldn't believe it. I fell over. I was sitting there thinking, "is this really happening?"'  

Robertson, who had five previous aces, was reportedly playing the round with assistant coach Russell Abbott and Virginia Tech redshirt players Amanda Hollandsworth and Allison Woodward. 

'The girls on my team were so excited and everyone I know in golf has been sending congratulations,' she said. 

'We went out for a nice dinner but I dodged the tradition of buying everyone a drink because my team isn't allowed to drink per college sports rules and they aren't 21. Anywhere else I'd be bankrupt.'
