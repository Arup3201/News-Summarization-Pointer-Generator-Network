Rafa Benitez attempted to put a funny spin on Napoli's struggles in the transfer market in order to quell fan discontent.

The former Liverpool manager has been linked with moves for Pepe Reina and Javier Mascherano, players he managed at Anfield, but has not yet been able to land his targets.

Instead the Spaniard has acquired Swansea forward Michu on a season-long loan and defender Kalidou Koulibaly and contines to scour the market in order to help Napoli improve on their disappointing third place finish in Serie A last season.

Upgrade: Benitez joked about swapping his wife for supermodel Claudia Schiffer

When questioned about Napoli's lack of activity this summer, Benitez likened strengthening his squad to swapping your wife for supermodel Claudia Schiffer.

He said: '"Do we want to exchange our wife" is like "do we want Mascherano". Weâ€™re in love with our wife, I mean, our players. Do we want to exchange our wife for Claudia Schiffer? It could be but it depends on your wife, are you happy with your wife? Lets wait for a response from the transfer market.'

Benitez's arrival in Naples last summer coincided with the arrival of Dries Mertens, Jose Callejon, Raul Albiol, Rafael Cabra, Gonzalo Higuain, Pepe Reina and Anthony Reveillere.

But this summer he has failed to conduct any such business leading to disillusionment from some supporters of the club.
