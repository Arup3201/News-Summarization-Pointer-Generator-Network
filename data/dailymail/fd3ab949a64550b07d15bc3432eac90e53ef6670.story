Swansea City manager Garry Monk is adamant he has no plans to sell England midfielder Jonjo Shelvey in January.

Monk criticised Shelvey ahead of the Barclays Premier League game at Liverpool when he told the 22-year-old to 'wise up' and said he would not tolerate his 'laziness' any more.

Shelvey was selected against his former club on Monday, but had an unhappy night in Swansea's 4-1 defeat as he failed to track Adam Lallana for Liverpool's third goal and then headed into his own net to cap a miserable night for Monk's men.

There was further bad news to come on Tuesday evening as he was charged with violent conduct by the Football Association. Shelvey clashed with Emre Can when he appeared to fling back an arm into the face of the German. The incident was not seen by the match officials.

If found guilty, Shelvey, who was sent off at Everton at the start of November, could face a four-match ban, starting at QPR on New Year's Day.

Monk, though, insists that Shelvey, who joined Swansea in a £5million deal in the summer of 2013, is going nowhere in next month's transfer window and has a key role to play at the Liberty Stadium.

'It is often the case (to sell) when a manager talks about a player,' Monk said. 'But that is absolutely not the case. It was not my intention to give the impression I do not want Jonjo here.

'When I talked about him I was talking about the specific instances where he can do better, in relation to the yellow cards he has picked up.

'When I talked about laziness I meant the situations he gets into to get bookings, not his overall performances.

'Yes, he can do better, but so can all our players. With Jonjo it is a case of me trying to help him, him trying to help himself and pushing on.

'He is going to get a lot better and I want that to happen here at Swansea, not anywhere else.'

Shelvey won his solitary England cap in 2012 and was called up to Roy Hodgson's squad last October for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.

But he has picked up seven bookings and a red card this season and Monk feels his disciplinary problems have been down to a lack of focus and application.

And Sky television pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher saw Shelvey smiling and laughing with Lallana ahead of the corner from which he headed into his own goal as a further loss of focus.

'I have not seen the Sky footage and I was not aware of that,' Monk said. 'But you need to be focused in those situations, especially a dangerous situation like a set-piece.

'I was disappointed with that goal as it was avoidable but I thought Jonjo's performance was good.

'We analyse the players and get all the feedback from their performances and on the ball he was one of our highest passers in the game.

'I thought he put himself about, had good energy and he was possibly our best passer on the day. He was probably our most threatening midfielder on the ball but I know he can be even better.

Shelvey capped off a forgettable evening by scoring an own goal for Liverpool's fourth

'Performance-wise, he's capable of running a game, grabbing it by the scruff of the neck and really dictating it, but what you forget is that he's a really young player.'

Swansea have had a demanding festive fixture list with the Boxing Day visit of Aston Villa sandwiched in between trips to Hull and Liverpool.

They travel to QPR before heading to Merseyside again for a third-round FA Cup tie at Tranmere on Saturday.

'You have to take into consideration the quick turnover of games, the physical output for the players,' Monk said ahead of two away games in the space of 48 hours.

'But each team I put out there I try to have the best team to win the game taking everything into account.

'You live and die by the result and performance and you think about it afterwards.

'So far this season, with the games we've played and the teams we've put out there, we've done very well.

'We're disappointed with what happened at Liverpool but it wasn't about application or effort.

'It was about mistakes and we made way too many against a very good side.'
