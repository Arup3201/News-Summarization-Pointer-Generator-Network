When 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was discovered murdered in her basement in 1996, many were quick to suspect her parents of carrying out the crime.

As it turns out, a grand jury voted in 1999 voted to indict the young beauty-queen's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, but then-Boulder, Colorado District Attorney Alex Hunter decided not to prosecute - a revelation first reported this year by the Boulder Daily Camera.

But that evidence may soon be public record thanks to a judge who ruled yesterday that the indictment should be made public, unless the current DA can make a compelling case for keeping them secret.

Time for transparency: A judge ruled yesterday in favor or releasing the 1999 grand jury indictment against John (left) and Patsy (right) Ramsey, parents of murdered 6-year-old pageant-queen JonBenet

Murder mystery: 6-year-old JonBenet was reported missing on Christmas Day 1996, and discovered dead in her home's basement the following day. The case remains unsolved

Current DA Stan Garnett will make his case against releasing that indictment mid-week next week.  His office has argued in the past that releasing the documents would constitute a 'beach of promise' to the grand jurors.

'The issue raised by the plaintiff's request and the lawsuit are more important than any one case,' said Chief Trial Deputy Sean Finn. 'Every grand juror and every witness who appears before a grand jury, takes an oath of secrecy, and every witness and grand juror is promised that those involved in the process will honor that oath.'

Their decision: Members of the grand jury are pictured in October 1999. They eventually voted in favor of indicting John and Patsy Ramsey

No action: But the grand jury's indictment was never prosecuted since then-District Attorney Alex Hunter didn't believe he could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Mr and Mrs Ramsey committed the crime

But Weld County Judge Robert Lowenbach ruled yesterday that it would not be a breach of grand-jury privacy to release the document and instead said that it was in the public interest to see the thought process behind the DA's decision.

'This court agrees that transparency of a prosecutor's decision not to proceed with an indictment from the grand jury is in the public interest,' Judge Lowenback wrote. 'Recognizing that the grand jury's "indictment" is not requited to be supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, but that the district attorney cannot proceed with a prosecution unless he has a reasonable belief that he can obtain a conviction, the process followed in this case offered citizens no opportunity to consider the conflict between the decisions of the prosecutor and the grand jury.'

So DA Garnett will have to find another reason to keep them out of the public.

Then and now: Then-District Attorney Alex Hunter (left) decided not to act on the grand jury's indictment. Current DA Stan Garnett (right) will argue to keep the indictment sealed next week

'This is a complicated legal issue,' Mr Garnett said in a statement Thursday. 'My office is reviewing the court's ruling very carefully and will make a determination how to respond by middle of next week.'

The Thursday ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed last month by Daily Camera reporter Charlie Brennan and a press advocacy group.

They believe that the indictment is a criminal justice record that 'reflects official action' by the grand jury and should be disclosed.

The indictment and ensuing lawsuit are just the latest bend in the legal back-and-forth between the criminal justice system and the Ramseys.

Gruesome discovery: JonBenet was found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her parent's Boulder, Colorado home (above)

Ongoing case: Patsy Ramsey was a suspect in her daughter's murder for the rest of the life. She died in 2006 from ovarian cancer 

No charges were ever actually filed against John or Patsy Ramsy, and the same goes for JonBenet's older brother Burke who allegedly slept through her kidnapping and subsequent murder in the family's basement on December 26.

Mrs Ramsey died after a battle with ovarian cancer in 2006 and John has since remarried.

In 2008, following the testing of previously unknown DNA found on JonBenet's underwear, the Boulder District Attorney formally ruled out any connection between JonBenet's immediate family members and the murder.

A new District Attorney reopened the case in 2009, and it still remains open to this day.

Cleared: John and Patsy Ramsy were formally cleared of suspicion in 2008 after the discovery of DNA evidence on JonBenet's clothing

Christmas Day, 1996: Parents of six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey receive a ransom note demanding $118,000

Boxing Day, 1996: JonBenet found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her home in Boulder, Colorado

Boulder Police quickly placed her parents,John and Patsy Ramsey, under an 'umbrella of suspicion' but they were never formally named as suspects

Detectives were later criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family

2003: DNA taken from the victim's clothes suggests the family were not involved

2006: Patsy Ramsey dies of ovarian cancer

August 2006: Former teacher John Mark Karr reportedly confesses to the murder while being held on child pornography charges. 

But no murder charge brought after his DNA found not to match that on JonBenet's body

2008: Boulder district attorney's office clears parents of any wrongdoing and issues apology

February 2009: Boulder Police Department takes the case back from the district attorney to reopen the investigation
