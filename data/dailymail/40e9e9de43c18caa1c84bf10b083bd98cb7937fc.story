It seems that the dog house is no longer a place to be banished to if Harrods' latest collection for pampered pets is anything to go by.

Besotted dog owners can now snap up a £1,600 jewelled bed handmade from
solid wood and covered with a sheepskin mattress topper and rows of 
tiny Swarovski crystals.

Another item for lap dogs of luxury is a set of leopard print steps so they can climb onto their luxury sleeping place - or indeed the sofa - with the only slightly less eye-watering price tag of £495.

And if the handmade bed is too much there’s a two poster alternative priced at £1,200.

The range for mollycoddled mutts has just gone on sale in Harrods’ Pet Kingdom alongside animal fashion from world-famous brands such as Burberry and Mulberry.

If all goes well, the Knightsbridge store plans to add a leopard print toy box and feeding station to the collection, as well as more colour options.

The furniture was designed for trendsetting chihuahua Rocky Noble who shot to fame last year as Britain’s best-dressed dog.

Owner Lynsey Noble, 28, has kitted him out with a wardrobe crammed with more than 1,500 outfits worth £2,500.

Lynsey, a beauty therapist from Maidstone, Kent, decided to commission a crystal-covered bespoke doggy bed for her pet from company Lush Pups.

When staff heard who it was for they decided to work with Rocky - and Lyndsey - to create the new range.

Lynsey said: 'It’s unbelievable to think he has a furniture range named after him, but it’s completely mad that it will be sold in Harrods.

'Everyone is so excited about getting the Noble name into Harrods - and all thanks to a little dog.

'I have to keep pinching myself because it all just feels like a dream.

'I love the range and have the whole lot at home. It goes really well in my house because my whole living room is leopard print.

'If I could swap my life with anyone it would by Rocky.

'But he is a good boy though. You know how you get those kids that get really spoilt because they have everything? He’s not like that, he’s just a really good dog.'

Rocky - who appeared on ITV’s Tiny Animals - boasts a wardrobe full of outfits, including a bumble bee ensemble, a Hugh Hefner style red dressing gown, plenty of animal print clothes and a suit which he plans to wear to the Harrods official launch next month.
