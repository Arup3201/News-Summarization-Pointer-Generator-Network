Ross Simons, 34, and wife Clare Simons, 30, died after their tandem bike was hit by a car in Bristol

A couple who were killed in an alleged hit and run while riding a tandem were today described as 'two peas in a pod' who were never apart and would do anything for anyone.

Pictured on their wedding day 18-months-ago, Ross Simons, 34, and his wife Clare, 30, were mowed down by a car which was being followed by police.

The pair, described by friends as lovely and caring, were said to be trying for a baby and had 'everything to live for'.

They had just been given the go-ahead to start fertility treatment and celebrated the happy news on Saturday night with friends at a meal.

Police said a car struck another vehicle then crashed into the two cyclists before the driver fled the scene of the crash in Bristol yesterday.

The incident happened shortly before 4pm in Hanham, on the eastern outskirts of the city, and the two cyclists died at the scene as a result of their injuries.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is now investigating an officer attempted to stop a speeding Citroen Picasso before the collision.

A 38-year-old man, who handed himself into police hours later, has been arrested on suspicion of death by 
dangerous driving and remains in police custody.

A 35-year-old woman has 
also been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.

Avon and Somerset police have today released a statement confirming that an officer had been following the vehicle.

Police said that shortly before 4pm, police attempted to pull over a Citroen Picasso that was 
travelling along Lower Hanham Road at speed.

A statement read: 'Shortly before 4pm yesterday (Sunday January 27), a police officer's attention was drawn to a Citroen Picasso travelling along Lower Hanham Road at speed.

'The officer indicated to the car to stop but it made off. The officer began to follow the car but it was lost to sight almost immediately.

It is believed the couple were on one of their first tandem bike rides when they were knocked down

'Very shortly afterwards the car struck another vehicle and then collided with two cyclists on a tandem bicycle.

'34
 year old Ross Matthew Simons and 30 year old Clare Simons both died at 
the scene of the incident as a result of the injuries they sustained.'

Inspector Frazer Davey from the Collision Investigation Team said: 'Following investigations overnight the circumstances of this collision have become much clearer.

'However I would appeal to anyone who witnessed this incident or saw this car in the area shortly before the collision to come forward and contact us.

'This is a tragic incident in which two people have needlessly lost their lives. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with their families.'

Paramedics attended the scene to find the man and woman had suffered fatal injuries.

'We took the call at 4pm reporting that a car hit two cyclists, a male and a female,' a spokeswoman for Great Western Ambulance Service said.

'We sent an ambulance, paramedics, a rapid response vehicle and had an officer at the scene to liaise with the other services.

The car was being followed by police before it crashed, it has today been revealed. Mr and Mrs Simons, who were said to be trying for a baby, had been married just 18 months

'But unfortunately both the patients were beyond help at the scene.'

It is believed the couple were on one of their first tandem bike rides when they were knocked down.

They were reportedly desperate for a baby and had just been given the go ahead to start IVF treatment.

Tributes left at the scene for the popular couple, who had just been given the go ahead for IVF treatment. Neighbours said they were 'like peas in a pod' and were rarely seen without each other

Family friend Diane Pullin, from Kingswood, Bristol, said she got to know the couple because her son-in-law Darren worked for Mr Simons’ father.

'They are a lovely family, so kind and so helpful,' she said.

'They don’t deserve this. They’d just had news that they were able to have fertility treatment... everything to live for.

'It’s just terrible and it shouldn’t have happened.

'Two young people with their lives in front of them... snapped away just like that.

'They were trying for children and they had just been told they could have fertility treatment.

'Everything to live for, they were such a lovely family.'

Mrs Pullin said her daughter Shelley and son-in-law Darren had been out for a meal on Saturday night with Mr and Mrs Simons.

'They desperately wanted children and it wasn’t happening,' Mrs Pullin said.

'They’d just been given the go-ahead. They were so happy on Saturday night.

'My daughter says she’s got helium balloons at the top of her stairs wishing them luck and she can’t even look at them.

'Like she said to me just now, ‘How can I be with them on Saturday night and they’re not here now?’. It just shows that nobody knows. No-one could have thought this on Saturday night.

'It’s just so sad. It’s all I can really say. Such a waste of a life. All these questions of ‘why?”'

Mr and Mrs Simons 'could never do enough for anybody', a family friend said as he laid flowers at the scene

A neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said they were on their way for a meal at Clare's parents' house when tragedy struck.

He said: 'They only bought the tandem a few weeks ago and hadn't used it much.

'They previously had separate mountain bikes but they were stolen from the house so they bought the tandem to replace them. I think this was one of the first times they'd been out on it.

'Ross built a garage at the house to securely keep the tandem. I believe
 they were were heading to Clare's family for tea when it happened.

'Both of their families live in that direction but I spoke to Clare's 
dad yesterday evening and he was worried because he hadn't heard from 
them and they hadn't turned up for the meal.

'Ross's dad called this morning and told me what had happened. He was extremely upset and crying down the phone.

'They were the best neighbours you could have, I've lived by them for five years and they were both lovely.

'I have two little ones and whenever they had a barbecue in the summer they would always ask us round.

'They were brilliant, you couldn't ask for better neighbours. They would do anything for anyone. This is terrible news.

'It is such a dreadful thing to happen to such a lovely couple.'

Speaking after laying flowers family friend Steve Camm said: 'They were like two peas in a pod.

'They were never apart. They could never do enough for anybody. They were caring people.'

Mr Camm said Mr and Mrs Simons had been married for about 18 months.

'They always did random stuff. You could never stop them from having fun,' he said, 'It's devastating.'

People continued to leave floral tributes at the scene.

One read: 'Ross and Clare you were an amazing couple and fantastic people. You will be missed so so much by all. RIP gone but never forgotten. In our hearts forever. All our love Darren, Shelley and Joshua xxx.'

Another tribute read: 'Ross and Clare. You will always be in our hearts.'You will truly be missed and never forgotten. All our love, Paul and Sharon xxx.'

Locals living in the predominately residential street spoke of their shock that a hit-and-run could happen in the area.

Rev Peter Cook, of Hanham Baptist Church, said: 'I think it is shock and incomprehension. It has ripped the community to its heart.

'I was just told about it when I was about to start my evening service and I really thought the person telling me was having me on.

'We stopped the service and prayed for what was going on - it seemed just so implausible.

'You don’t expect it happening on a Sunday afternoon when you are out for a cycle. I think it was totally out of the ordinary and that’s why people are so shocked by it.

'I know lots and lots of people in the community are praying for them and we want to give their families our deepest sympathies.

'We can’t imagine what it’s like to lose two people like this.'

Inspector Frazer Davey, from the collision investigation team, said: 'Following investigations overnight, the circumstances of this collision have become much clearer.

'However, I would appeal to anyone who witnessed this incident or saw this car in the area shortly before the collision to come forward and contact us.

'This is a tragic incident in which two people have needlessly lost their lives. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with their families.'

The Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed it had received a referral from the force.
