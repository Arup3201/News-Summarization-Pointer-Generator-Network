A fearless mother and daughter used a pair of salad tongs to capture an escaped red-eyed snake they spotted slithering along their garden wall.

Bridie Denniss, 24, was enjoying a cup of tea in her kitchen with her mum Ann when she looked out of the window and saw the 3ft long snake.

Brave Ann, 54, grabbed a pair of tongs from the kitchen draw along with a garden sack and went after it.

Feisty: A fearless mother and daughter, from Weymouth, Dorset, captured an angry Californian King snake with a pair of salad tongs after finding it on the loose in their garden

The rancorous reptile started hissing, rattling its tail and even tried to bite them - but after a short struggle the plucky pair got the tongs around it and bundled it into the sack.

It was then placed in a glass tank they used to used to keep geckos in.

After checking with neighbours and asking friends on Facebook to see if anyone had lost a pet snake, Bridie contacted a pet shop and a member of staff came to collect it.

The reptile was identified as an 
albino California King Snake, which are common as pets but are known for
their feisty temperament.

Bridie,
a mother of three from Weymouth in Dorset, said: 'We were having a cup 
of tea as we do every morning and were sitting in my kitchen when I 
looked out of the window.

'I could see something crawling along the wall and I told my mum it looked like a snake.

'When
she agreed we looked at each other for a second in disbelief and went 
outside, we thought we had better catch it because it must belong to 
someone.

The angry snake tried to bite Bridie (left) and her mother Ann Denniss (right) but the defiant pair eventually grabbed it with the salad tongs and put it in the bin bag

'She went inside and came back with a sack and a pair of salad tongs and I tried to scoop it up but it fell on the floor.

'My mum was running around saying "just grab it" but it started hissing, rattling its tail, and tried to go for my hand. Luckily I was wearing a garden glove.

'My children were screaming every time it did something.

'Eventually I managed to get it inside the bag and place it inside a vivarium I had at home, and we asked the neighbours if it was their pet snake.

'It wasn’t theirs so I put it on Facebook and contacted a pet shop, and a member of staff came along and collected it.'

Pet shop manager Chris Hewlett said: 'It is an albino California King Snake. They are quite a common pet snake.'

The snake will be looked after by the pet shop until its owner is found.

California king snakes are non-venomous reptiles, commonly found in western United States and northern Mexico.

It is also found in the wild in Gran Canaria, Spain, due to captive animals having been released on the island.

California king snakes are smaller relatives of the common king snake and are one of the most popular species to be kept as pets.

They are powerful constrictors and feed upon rodents, other reptiles, birds and amphibians.

They are even known to hunt and kill other snakes, including venomous rattle snakes, which is why they are named 'King' snakes.

They are largely impervious to the rattlesnake's venom, but not completely.

Both species live in similar habitats, side by side; the King snake will only eat a rattle snake when the opportunity arises.

King snakes are considered harmless to humans but if handled they often bite and females can excrete a nasty musk and faecal contents.

The King snake is one of the most popular in captivity since it is easy to care for and can also be tamed.

They can now be found in many different colours and patterns due to breeding.
