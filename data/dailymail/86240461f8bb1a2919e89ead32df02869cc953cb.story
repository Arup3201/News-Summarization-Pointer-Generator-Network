Most drivers will know just how annoying, not to mention dangerous, it can be when a motorist driving in the opposite direction blinds them by leaving their full-beam headlights on.

But now police in China appear to have developed a novel punishment for anyone caught with their lights on full-beam at night - forcing them to sit and stare into the headlights themselves. 

Traffic police in the city of Shenzhen, in south east China's Guangdong province, introduced the rule following a number of accidents blamed on motorists blinding drivers of oncoming traffic by using their lights on full-beam.

Any motorist who now refuses to undergo the punishment faces a fine, having their car impounded and even runs the risk of losing their licence.

A local traffic police department spokesman said the initiative had received some criticism but overall it had been widely appreciated.

The spokesman said: 'We have had a few critics but overall the vast majority of people have approved the initiative. 

'Anybody caught with full beam is asked to pay a small fine (£30) and has to stare at the headlights themselves to see what it is like.'

A number of people who have undergone the punishment however complained that the ordeal had lasted five minutes, when interviewed by local media.

Police have denied the punishment lasted this long, claiming it was more likely to last for just seconds and only occasionally up to a minute but never longer. 

The police spokesman said: 'A short time is enough to give people an idea of what the other driver is seeing and to be more considerate in the future. 

'We don't want to punish them by causing pain or damaging their eyes.'
