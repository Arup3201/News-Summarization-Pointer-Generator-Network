When a university's cheerleaders began entertaining the crowds lining the streets before a major homecoming game, they hoped to raise spirits.

But it seems police did not get into the spirit of the event.

Police in London, Ontario, slapped The University of Western Ontario’s head cheerleader Max Gow with a $140 fine for 'causing a nuisance'.

'Nuisance': Police cracked down on The University of Western Ontario cheerlearders for performing to the crowds who had gathered on the street before a homecoming game

The incident provoked outrage from the troupe's head coach, David-Lee Tracey who branded it the 'single dumbest act' he said he has witnessed in his 33 year career.

He told The Star it was 'absolute insanity' to issue to fine, adding: 'Since when is it against the law to yell your school name?'

'Stupid, stupid, stupid.' ‘Go ’Stangs Go, Go ’Stangs Go,’ is now a public offence.'

The squad was headed to TD Stadium
for the Mustangs game against the Queen’s Golden Gaels.

The four members began cheering in a parking lane, out of the way of any potential passing cars.

Three male cheerleaders were throwing a female teammate into the air on Broughdale Avenue.

The explanation written on the ticket said: 'Causing a nuisance in the street by conducting a cheerleading performance.'

Mr Tracey said the team has received 'mountains of support' from people across Twitter.

The team plans to challenge the ticket, although Tracey hopes it can be done in a timely manner.

'Right now, we are just trying to find enough adult support, someone with higher authority,' he said.

London Police have been cracking down during their Project L.E.A.R.N. campaign, which ends Sunday.

The
aim of it is to address 'quality of life issues' and to target 
'specific geographic areas traditionally plagued with nuisance type 
behaviours,' according to the London police website.

'Perhaps today was supposed to be one of their hit list days,' Tracey said.
