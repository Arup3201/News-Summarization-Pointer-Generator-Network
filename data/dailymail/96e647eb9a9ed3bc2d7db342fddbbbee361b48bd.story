Conservative activists let it all hang out in a noontime tea party protest outside the Internal Revenue Service headquarters building in Washington, DC on Tuesday. About 70 protesters held signs, chanted slogans, and listened to speakers rail against what they called 'their 'unconstitutional' treatment at the hands of the federal government's tax authorities.

'Big government is the problem,' Tea Party WDC founder Lisa Miller told MailOnline. 'They're going to have to produce all the documents showing who ordered this persecution of tea party groups, when it happened, and how much President Obama knew about it.'

Miller's group organized the rally, one of dozens held around the country, to highlight what she called the federal government's 'harassment and intimidation.' The largest protest, attracting a reported 250 activists, was in Cincinnati, the home of the IRS office that evaluates and approves applications for nonprofit tax-exempt status.

That office, the IRS has conceded, unfairly targeted conservative groups for extra scrutiny based on their names and political positions.

Protesters carried hand-made signs with political messages on Tuesday, including one that wouldn't be family friendly if it were spelled out

Tea party activists said they held President Obama responsible for the 'abuses' his tax collectors inflicted on conservative groups because of the political beliefs of their members

In Washington, organizers led chants of 'Big government! Big problem!'

Andrew Langer, president of the Institute for Liberty, told the crowd through an electric bullhorn that 'if you leave here with no other message, it's that government has no rights.'

'People have rights,' he said. 'Government has power. And when those powers are abused, the people will ultimately take them back.'

A trio of elderly Floridians joined in the protest. Cas Henderson (C) is 93 years old. Barbara Haskins (L), from Sarasota, said, 'I'm in full support of freedom of speech. We do this all the time in Florida'

One activist, who would not give his name, wore a 'mask of intimidation and fear' to protest the IRS for using an extra layer of surveillance to evaluate conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. The back of his mask read, 'Don't audit me, Bro'!!' and 'Tyranny is a drag'

Langer told MailOnline after the 45-minute protest that he doubts President Obama's claim that he knew nothing about the IRS harassing tea party groups until an Inspector General report was leaked to media outlets on May 10.

'No,' he said. 'Absolutely not. He's corrupt. And I find it fascinating how they're trying to spin this so the president isn't to blame.'

'We have to find out who gave the order to persecute the tea party, but the fish always stinks from the head.'

'If not Obama, then who?' he asked. 'If the White House is honest, Obama is either complicit or ignorant. I think they may be keeping him out of the loop - for a reason.'

A tea party supporter dressed in Revolutionary War garb displayed a historical 'Appeal to Heaven' flag outside the IRS headquarters. The flag design dates to 1775 and was flown on ships commissioned by George Washington. John Locke wrote in his Two Treatises of Government that after men have exhausted all avenues of seeking justice, an "appeal to heaven' is the option of last resort

Department of Homeland Security police protected the IRS headquarters building on Tuesday as tea party protesters gathered for their protest, one of many held throughout the United States

Asked about the president's chief spokesman at the White House, Langer said, 'I think Jay Carney is a useful dupe.'

Ron Kirby, a demonstrator from Alexandria, Virginia, carried a sign reading, 'Don't target me, Bro'

He said he is skeptical that Obama wasn't aware of the abuses going on inside hie Treasury Department until he saw a televised news report.

'This is too convenient,' Kirby told MailOnline. 'I'm wondering if he gets all his news about his own government from TV. Every time something big comes up, he's learning about it on CNN or MSNBC.'

'Isn't he supposed to know things?'

Miller, the event's chief organizer, stopped short of calling for more IRS firings in addition to acting commissioner Steven Miller, who will step down just weeks ahead of his appointment's scheduled ending date.

'The problem, no matter who is in these jobs,' she said, 'is big government.'

One tea party protester wore a 'FREE HEALTHCARE' t-shirt whose fine print read ''not counting higher taxes, Medicare spending cuts, the repurchase of Louisiana, a new airport in Cleveland and 2000 more pages of goodies. The message is a reference to pork-barrel spending and tax hikes that conservatives say is part of the President Obama's Affordable Care Act

Andrew langer (L) and Lisa Miller (C), addressed the crowd, saying that the growth of the federal government makes the IRS a likely place for abuses

Colorful characters were the norm on Tuesday, as were signs lambasting President Barack Obama. Ron Kirby (R) mocked the president for finding out about his own administration by watching television news programs

But Langer and others specifically mentioned Sarah Hall Ingram, the former chief of the IRS' tax-exempt division who is now in charge of the agency's office tasked with implementing new taxes under the Affordable Care Act.

'The idea that she has not been fired,' Langer said, 'is an indication of her importance to the administration and its twin goals: to destroy this movement and to implement Obamacare.'

Phil Kerpen the former vice president of Americans for Prosperity who now leads his own group, American Commitment, told MailOnline that 'dozens of people should be fired' at the IRS 'because they were complicit. I think almost all these people have to go.'

But 'at the same time,' he conceded, 'you could replace everyone at the IRS and they would still have the power to do this. What we should really do is limit their power to begin with.'

Kerpen also noted the large cash bonuses that were paid to Ingram in recent years, totaling more than $100,000.

'Someone needs to ask President Obama if he personally signed off on Sarah Hall Ingram's bonuses,' he said.

The federal government's Office of Personnel Management, he said, requires president approval of all staff bonuses greater than $25,000.

Serious messages: Tea party activists carried stern warnings to the IRS after the agency targeted their groups for special treatment based on their political philosophies

A trio of elderly ladies including a 93-year-old visiting Washington from Sarasota, Florida, told MailOnline that they supported the tea party, and would have brought flags to wave if they had known no one would be there to hand them out.

Spotting the police presence on the scene, including a cadre of officers from the Department of Homeland Security, a woman from Texas who identified herself as 'Mary' said she was surprised to see the government's police out in force.

'The gray-haired old ladies must look really frightening,' she said with thick sarcasm. 'How dare they exercise their freedom of speech.'
