Police have been left baffled after a 22-year-old hairdresser was found dead in the driving seat of her torched car following a girls' night out with other stylists.

Investigators believe Elizabeth Lightfoot was murdered, but are trying to determine exactly how as her body had been too burned to immediately tell.

Dallas firefighters discovered her charred remains at around 2.30am on Friday morning after putting out a blaze engulfing the silver Sedan, which was parked nose-first in a small ravine beside a strip shopping centre in the north of the city.

Puzzling: Elizabeth Lightfoot, pictured, was found in her torched out car following a night out with hair stylist colleagues

Mystery: Dallas Police are still trying to establish how the 22-year-old died as her body, found in her silver Sedan, pictured, was too burned to immediately tell

Outgoing: Miss Lightfoot, who attended the Toni and Guy Hairdressing Academy, was described as a confident woman and a talented hair stylist

'The fire at the scene made it impossible to determine the cause of death,' Dallas Police Sergeant Warren Mitchell said. 'At this time, we're waiting on answers from the medical examiner's office.'

Miss Lightfoot, from Denton, had recently started a job at Salon Republic in Addison, having worked at Salon D just three miles for the last two years.

Her boss at Salon D said she had been out to a restaurant on Thursday evening with some female colleagues from her former hairdressers the night of her death.

'They went to a restaurant down the street from here, which they normally do,' Arden Keshishian told NBC 5 News. 'It wasn't anything crazy - they left at 12, and everyone made it home but her.'

'It's a shame, it's a waste, a life cut so short,' he told Fox News. 'She was very outgoing, very talented stylist, she was an angel. I just can't believe somebody would do that.'

Mother and daughter: Barbara Lightfoot, Elizabeth's mother, right, said her daughter was a kind woman who needed the public's help to catch her killer

Clues: Her former boss at Salon D, Arden Keshishian, left, said he thought someone who knew her was behind the killing, which took place after Miss Lighfoot left YourWay Burgers, right, at around midnight

Boyfriend: According to Facebook, Miss Lightfoot, a Henderson State University graduate, left, has a boyfriend, Tuan 'RudeBoy' Le, right

Sibling: Miss Lightfoot with her brother Michael

The group had been eating at Farmers Branch restaurant Yourway Burgers and left at around midnight.

Miss Lightfoot, who studied at Toni and Guy Hairdressing Academy, was not seen again until her car was found burning in the 16000 block of Preston Road, less than a mile from Salon Republic.

Police are speaking to the manager of Yourway Burgers and her friends in a bid to retrace the steps she took that night and have analysed surveillance footage from the restaurant. There are no CCTV cameras at the scene of her death.

'It was nothing out of the ordinary from what I've found out,' Mr Keshishian told Fox News. 'Everything was just the same. I don't know if she saw anybody there, we're just puzzled.

'She wasn't stupid, she wouldn't have been uncareful.'

Suspicious: Her car was discovered parked nose-first in a small ravine beside a strip shopping centre in the north of Dallas

According to Facebook, Miss Lightfoot has a boyfriend, Tuan 'RudeBoy' Le, and pictures posted on the site show a fun-loving young woman with a flair for style.

'She had everything going for her,' Mr Keshishian told NBC 5 News. 'I don't know why this happened. It's horrible.

'It would be really hard to imagine some random person. I would look at people she knows, the people closest to her.'

Miss Lightfoot's mother, Barbara Lightfoot, issued this statement: 'Elizabeth was a kind, considerate and beautiful young woman who needs everyone's help now. Everyone loved her.'

Mrs Lightfoot is urging anyone with information to call police.
