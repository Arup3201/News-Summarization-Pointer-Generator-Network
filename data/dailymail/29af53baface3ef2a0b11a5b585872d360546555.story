Victim: Damian Chlywka, 32, was murdered and bound up before being dumped down a well in a garden in Warlingham, Surrey, police say

Police have identified a murder victim who was assaulted, tied up and dumped down a well about two years ago.

Workmen discovered the decomposing body of Damian Chlywka, 32, when they began renovating a garden at a detached home two weeks ago.

They peered into the well in an unkempt garden in Warlingham, Surrey and saw skin and hair of the victim.

Eventually the body of Polish national Mr Chlywka was pulled to the surface.

A post mortem examination failed to reveal a cause of death but police said it was believed to have been in the well for two years.

It is thought that Mr Chlywka was murdered at the address - where he had lived previously.

His body was then tied up before being thrust down the well, police believe.

Detectives confirmed this morning that two more men, aged 41 years and 31 years, had been arrested and were being held in a south London police station for questioning.

They been bailed until the middle of January.

Seven other men, all previously arrested over the death, have since been released on police bail pending further inquiries.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that the victim's relatives in Poland had been contacted and told of his death. He was believed to have come to the UK in 2008.

A police spokesman said: 'Police were called after workmen discovered his body in a well outside an address in Warlingham at around 13:50hrs on November 15,'

'Specialist officers, including Metropolitan Police divers, attended the scene and recovered Damian's body which had sustained injuries consistent with an assault, prior to being placed in the well.'

Arrests: Two more men have been arrested on suspicion of murder, police confirmed today. Seven other men previously arrested in connection to the death have been released on bail

Detective Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons, who is leading the investigation, said: 'Damian had lived at various addresses across London including two known to be in the Croydon area. At one point he had lived at the property.

'Our focus now is to build up a fuller picture of Damian's life in the UK. We have given the difficult and heartbreaking news to his family who are distraught that this has happened to their loved one.

'I am appealing to anyone who knew or previously worked with him to contact the police and help us to piece together a picture of Damian's life and how it came to end in these distressing circumstances.'

Investigation: Police, pictured outside the address, are now appealing for witnesses to the case
