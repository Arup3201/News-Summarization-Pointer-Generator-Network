A father strangled his two young sons in front of his ex-wife before shooting himself dead just days before the couple went to court over their divorce, police said.

Isidro Zavala, 45, entered the family home in south Florida on Saturday where he attacked his two sons Eduardo, 12, and 11-year-old Mario.

Victoria Flores Zavala, 36, was watching TV at around 1.50am when she discovered her estranged husband choking one of her sons with a rope.

He also allegedly shot his youngest son several times at the home in Boynton Beach. One boy was found dead in a screened patio area, and the other was in the kitchen.

Mrs Zavala told authorities her husband said that she had been spared so she could suffer the loss of her children, according to police spokeswoman Stephanie Slater.

She
was not injured. Officers found both boys dead at the scene, and they 
found Zavala, dressed all in black, dead with self-inflicted gunshot 
wounds in the chest and head.

The mother tried to fight him off and begged to be killed instead of her two boys.

‘He told her she was going to stay alive and suffer the loss of them,’ Slater said.

'This is an unusually brutal type of murder,' said Boynton Beach Police Chief Matthew Immler.

The couple had filed for divorce in October after nearly 20 years of marriage, according to the Palm Beach Post. They were scheduled to go to court on Tuesday for a mediation hearing.

Zavala's roommate said he last saw his friend on Friday evening at their house, less than a mile away from the crime scene.

Mariano Batalla said that Zavala said he couldn't attend a friend's birthday party because 'he had to do something important'.

Mr Batalla said he returned from the 
party around midnight and repeatedly tried to call Zavala, who never 
answered his phone. Zavala's truck remained parked in their driveway. 
Police woke Batalla about 5am and told him what happened.

'I
feel so, so, so sad because he's my best friend,' Batalla said. 'It's a
big surprise for me. He don't tell me nothing about this.'

The Zavalas also have a 19-year-old son who does not live at his mother's house. Investigators found a note from Zavala to his oldest son in a bag at the crime scene.

In the note, Zavala told the 19-year-old that he was a good son and to take care of himself, Immler said. The bag also contained a second gun, extra ammunition, duct tape and cutting shears.

A second note was found at Isidro Zavala's home, but police did not release its contents.

Batalla said that the second note was addressed to him. He said Zavala left him several hundred dollars and instructions to keep his truck and work tools.

Victoria Zavala had been licensed as a cosmetologist, and Isidro Zavala owned a landscaping company.

Children who live across the street say they last saw Mario several days ago when they were flying kites with another friend. They remembered him playing in their backyard or playing video games, and they could not understand why Mario's father would kill him.

Police said they had never visited the Zavalas' home. A spokeswoman for the Department of Children and Families said the agency also had no previous history with the family.

Batalla said he knew Zavala as a gentle friend who made pork and rice dishes for special occasions and who walked to church every weekend. Batalla had recently been baptized and he had encouraged Zavala to do the same.

'But he kept telling me, ''No, not yet,''' Batalla said. 'He said he wanted to learn more before he got baptized.'
