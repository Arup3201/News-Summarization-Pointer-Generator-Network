A smart watch has been launched for five-year-olds as toddlers lead the way into a new era of wearable technology.

The watch includes an on-board video and stills camera, voice recorder and a connection to a home computer to download images and sound.

All are controlled through a 1.4in touchscreen, while the software allows children to edit and manipulate the captured images.

Vtech unveiled its £39.99 Kidizoom smartwatch, pictured, at the London Toy Fair. It has a 1.4-inch touchscreen and comes with a built-in 0.3 megapixel camera that takes photos and records videos. The watch also features a voice recorder, motion sensor and is pre-installed with games

The Vtech Kidizoom smartwatch includes a motion sensor, three built-in video games, an alarm clock, timer and stopwatch. 

It has a 1.4-inch touchscreen and a 0.3 megapixel camera that can be used to take photos and record video.

The watch also features a voice recorder and motion sensor.

To view and edit photos, or backup data, wearers can wirelessly connect the watch to a home computer.

But the technology does not stop there, for the Vtech Kidizoom smartwatch includes a motion sensor, three built-in video games, an alarm clock, timer and stopwatch.

Apart from all the bells and whistles the watch, which costs £39.99, also tells the time with users able to choose between a traditional analogue display or simple digital numbers.

Major tech companies are putting wearable technology, everything from wrist bands that can track the pulse to socks that measure stride length, at the heart of their new products this year.

Samsung has launched its Galaxy Gear watch and Sony has its own smartwatch, while Apple is expected to launch its iWatch in 2014.

Separately the Google glass, which is worn like a pair of spectacles, will put the internet in front of people’s eyes and allow them to video and share what they see and do.

The smartwatch additionally features a motion sensor, an alarm clock, timer and stopwatch. The Vtech Kidizoom is due to be released later this year, although an exact date has not been announced

However, the launch of the VTech watch means that five-year-olds could join the wearable technology revolution even before their parents.

The company has a track record of bringing technology to toddlers. Last year it launched the ‘iPad for babies’, a tablet designed for youngsters aged 12 months and up.

Vtech’s Charlotte Johnson said: ‘We know that firms like Samsung and Sony have already created smart watches for adults, but we want children to be able play their part in the development of this technology.

‘This is about using technology to improve and enhance a simple product like a watch. It will help develop skills that will become important in the future.’

She said the watches are robust enough to cope with being bumped and bashed, while she believes children will be happy to wear them to school.

The smartwatch provides new evidence as to how technology is revolutionising traditional toys and playtime.

Toy manufacturers are being forced to adapt their products to try and ensure children do not defect to computer games and consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation.

Last year, the industry saw a five per cent fall in the number of toys sold, bringing the total down to 363million.

The Toy Fair is organised by the British Toy and Hobby Association, which has produced a list of 39 products it believes will be successful this year.

Big sales are predicted for the Downton Abbey board game, Flying Fairies dolls, and a new incarnation of the Tamagotchi digital pets.

It is also an important year for Lego, which was founded in Denmark in 1932 as a simple building blocks toy but is about to get the full Hollywood treatment.

Vtech's Charlotte Johnson said: 'We know that firms like Samsung and Sony have already created smart watches for adults, but we want children to be able to play their part in the development of this technology. It will help develop skills that will become important in the future'

A blockbuster movie featuring Lego characters and the voices of stars such as Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman and Chris Pratt will open in cinemas next month.

The company is linking the movie to a new range of toys that it hopes will further boost sales of a brand that continues to grow despite problems for the rest of the market.

The family movie has been made by Warner Bros and has been likened to the animations put together by Pixar, such as Toy Story.

It represents a huge leap for a brand that has made a success of tying its name to blockbuster movies ranging from Star Wars to  Harry Potter and The Hobbit.

The Lego movie follows the story of Emmet, an ordinary rules-following, perfectly average Lego Minifigure, who is mistakenly identified as the most extraordinary person with the key to saving the world.   

The toy company has launched 13 sets linked to the movie, ranging from the Getaway Glider, at £11.99, to the Evil Lair of Lord Business, played by Ferrell, which comes in at £59.99.
