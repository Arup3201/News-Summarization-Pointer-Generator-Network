A familiar face in high-quality period dramas, actress Kristin Scott Thomas is not the obvious choice for a debate on violence in films.

But following her decision to take on the role of matriarch Crystal in Only God Forgives, Scott Thomas yesterday revealed that even she was disturbed by the scenes of brutality in the film.

And the Oscar-nominated star was further appalled that it was given a 12 rating in France – a decision she said was made purely to make money and that she would never allow her 12-year-old son to watch it.

The film, which was given an 18 rating by the British Board of Film Classification and an R-rating in the United States, is the Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn’s first since the 2011 thriller Drive and sees Scott Thomas virtually unrecognisable in a long bleached-blonde wig, heavy make-up and fake nails.

The mother-of-three whose youngest child is son George, 14, said that the viewing public in general have become more difficult to shock: ‘I found [the film] incredibly violent, and I was very disturbed by the fact that in France it was given the official seal of approval that any child over the age of 12 could see it. That was just the producer wanting to make more money, but it was irresponsible. There is no way my 12-year-old son would see that film.

‘I think [the level of violence in films] is disturbing. People should be more affected. I think people are getting more and more used to violence, violent images and sexual images. We’re so used to using the word “f**k” now.’

In her interview with Hunger magazine the 54-year-old said that she has seen first-hand how violent films can encourage violent behaviour in children: ‘I’ve seen with my own eyes that more than 20 minutes in front of a screen playing a game is very bad for children.

'It’s because they have this idea that they’re all powerful, and that they’re running the world when they’re playing this game, and they find it hard to relate to authority after that. I’ve found that with my own children. They can’t stand being frustrated because they can’t do this or that, but a few minutes before their thumbs were ruling the world.’

Winning her first major role as heiress Mary Sharon, opposite Prince, in 1986’s Under the Cherry Moon, Scott Thomas rose to international fame in the Nineties with Bitter Moon and Four Weddings and a Funeral.

Her role as Katharine Clifton, alongside Ralph Fiennes, in The English Patient in 1996 led to an Oscar nomination and she recently shared the screen with Fiennes once more in The Invisible Woman, playing the concerned mother of Charles Dickens’s teenage lover.

She said she took the part of Crystal to push the boundaries once more: ‘You have to try new things because otherwise it just gets dull. That’s one of the reasons why I did Nick’s film because no one has ever asked me to do anything like that before. What I hate doing is repeating something I have already done. I want to be a bit dangerous, otherwise it’s not fun.’

 A record number of films were rated 12A last year, raising concerns that more and more children are being exposed to scenes of violence and sex.

In 2013, 321 films were given the classification, up by a third from 234 the previous year.

The rating means children aged 12 and over can see a film unaccompanied - and those under 12 can view it if with an adult.

It also emerged yesterday that Tom Cruise’s hit Jack Reacher, originally rated 12A, prompted the most complaints to the British Board of Film Classification last year. The ‘violent, dark and sadistic’ thriller, which sees a man shoot dead five people, had been cut to get it down to the 12A rating but still generated 26 complaints.

Wolverine, The Impossible and About Time, other 12 and 12A films, generated protests about strong language and sexual references.
