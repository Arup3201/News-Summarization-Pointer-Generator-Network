Hull KR prop Michael Weyman has announced his retirement with immediate effect at the age of 30 after failing to recover from a knee injury.

Weyman made 24 appearances for the Robins after joining them from St George Illawarra at the start of last season but has missed their opening four Super League matches of 2015, and after undergoing knee surgery a fortnight ago has now decided to hang up his boots.

The former Canberra and New South Wales forward, who was a Grand Final and World Club Challenge winner with the Dragons, will now return home to Australia with his family.

'It has meant a lot to me to play for Rovers and I would like to thank the supporters and everybody at the club for making my family and I feel so welcome over the last 18 months,' said Weyman, who was runner-up to Josh Hodgson as Rovers' player of the year in 2014.

'We've really enjoyed our time here and we've met some great friends who we'll continue to stay in touch with after we move back to Australia.

'It's a sad way to end my career but unfortunately these things happen and I've been lucky enough to achieve what I have in the game. It's now time to look at the bigger picture and think about my family.

'My knee isn't responding to treatment and I wanted to do the right thing by the club as well. I don't want to be sitting in the stands for most of the year.'

Hull KR coach Chris Chester said: 'We are disappointed to lose a player of Mick's calibre but he has been a great servant to the club during his time here and he leaves with our best wishes for the future.

'He's been a great leader for this club and this is not the way he would have wanted to end his career, but he's played at the highest level and can be rightly proud of what he's achieved in the game.

'We've already begun the search for a replacement for Mick and we're looking both in this country and overseas. We now have a full quota spot to play with but we won't be rushing into any decisions. We have a really close-knit squad this year and whoever we bring in will have to fit in both on and off the field.' 

Hull KR are sad to see a player of Weyman's calibre leave the club but wished him well in the future
