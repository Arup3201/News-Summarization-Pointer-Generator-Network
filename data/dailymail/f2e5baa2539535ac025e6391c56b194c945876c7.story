This is the heart-stopping moment a daredevil jumps over a supercar speeding towards him at 80mph.

Swedish stuntman Alassan Issa Gobitaca, known as Al the Jumper, is an internet sensation known for hurdling speeding vehicles.

Al, who trains by jumping on and off a box at the gym, can be seen jumping a split-second before the Lamborghini ploughs into him at high speed in Stockholm.

Hair-raiding: It all began when a friend asked Al to try and jump over a stationary car, but this was not enough of a challenge for the dauntless Swede.

Heart-stopping: Al waits until a car is four metres in front of him before jumping if it is travelling at 55mph

The Guinness World Record holder claims he doesn't risk his life for the fame, or to get rich, but because he loves setting himself personal goals.

It all began when a friend asked Al to try and jump over a stationary car. But this was not enough of a challenge for the dauntless Swede.

'I didn't see it as a challenge when it wasn't moving so I asked him to drive at me so I could make the jump,' he said.

'It was scary, but fun. I'm a bit of a daredevil so I like to do this sort of thing.'

He has calculated he must wait until a car is four metres in front of him before jumping if it is travelling at 55mph.

In other death-defying stunts, Al jumped over two motorbikes as they hurtled towards him at 70mph.
