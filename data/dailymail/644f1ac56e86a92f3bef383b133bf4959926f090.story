Hero RAF helicopter pilot Marc Heal is hoping to raise £30,000  just four years after the Queen presented him with the Distinguished Flying Cross for 'outstanding gallantry and courage'

A hero pilot who helped save 29 soldiers in some of the most intense fighting of the Afghan war is selling his prestigious bravery medal.

Flight Lieutenant Marc Heal, 34,was presented him with the Distinguished Flying Cross by the Queen for his act of 'outstanding gallantry and courage'.

The RAF officer, who has also been given the freedom of his home city, dodged bullets and bombs to fly his Chinook helicopter in and out of a battle zone to rescue wounded men.

On one of the eight incredibly-risky flights, the landing site was hit by a mortar shell just moments after Fl Lt Heal took off.

Over three days he transported 29 British and Afghan troops to Camp Bastion for emergency treatment after battles with the Taliban.

Only 22 DFCs were awarded for the Afghan war.

Fl Lt Heal is now auctioning his medal group for an estimated £30,000 to raise money for his family.

Steven Bosley, of Bosley's Auctions of Marlow, Bucks, said: 'He was a very brave man. It wasn't just a single act of courage, he put his life on the line time and again over a three day period.

'Unlike the Military Cross, there weren't many DFCs given for Afghanistan which is why they tend to command a high price when they come up for sale. 

Fl Lt Heal served with the RAF's 18 Squadron and was on his fifth tour of Afghanistan when Operation Panther's Claw was carried out in July 2009.

The British-led mission was aimed at securing a number of canal and river crossings but resulted in heavy casualties.

Fl Lt Heal was honoured for his hero missions with the RAF in which he was awarded, shown from left to right, the Distinguished Flying Cross, Operational Service Medal, NATO Medal and the EIIR Diamond Jubilee Medal

Each time Fl Lt Heal flew into the war zone it was under a hail of bullets from the enemy and without an escort gunship.

He said: 'We went into a landing site where the enemy was right on top of our guys. 

'When we lifted off for the second time a mortar round came in, just missing us and falling on our landing site we'd just taken off from.

'Because that created more casualties on the ground we had no choice but to drop off those onboard at the hospital and then go straight back to the same landing site, even though we had just seen it mortared.'

After touching down for a third time, Fl Lt Heal received radio messages informing him the enemy had advanced to within 200 yards of his Chinook but he had no choice but to wait until more men had been loaded on board.

His DFC medal group along with his RAF officer's tunic and a scroll granting Fl Lt Heal with the freedom on his home city of Brighton and Hove are being sold tomorrow.

It was a three-day mission against the odds to rescue his fellow troops.

But Flight Lieutenant Marc Heal bravely dodged bullets and bombs to fly his Chinook helicopter in and out of a battle zone to rescue wounded men fighting on the front line against the Taliban.

Over three days the 34-year-old waded into some of the fiercest battles in the Afghan war and safely pulled-out 29 British and Afghan troops to Camp Bastion for treatment after the bloody stand-off.

On one of the eight incredibly-risky flights, Fl Lt Heal’s landing site for his Chinook was hit by a mortar shell just moments after he took off.

Fl Lt Heal bravely navigated his Chinook while serving with the RAF's 18 Squadron.

He was on his fifth tour of Afghanistan when the squadron swooped on the Taliban in Operation Panther's Claw in July 2009.

An earlier version of this article wrongly stated that Mark Heal intended to emigrate following the sale of his medals. We are happy to clarify that this was not part of his plan.
