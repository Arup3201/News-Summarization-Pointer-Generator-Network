Michael Gove was accused of jeopardising Britain’s Olympic legacy yesterday as it emerged he allowed schools to sell off 50 playing fields over the past three years.

On average, 17 are closed every year, most in Conservative local authorities.

The figures make a mockery of a pledge to protect them in the Coalition agreement.

Olympic dreams: There is growing anger that 50 school playing fields have been sold over the past three years, which could jeopardise the future of British sport, said Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg

This followed the huge outcry over Labour disposing of playing fields at the slightly higher rate of 28 each year.

Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg accused the Government of damaging sport. He said: ‘David Cameron and Michael Gove are putting the Olympic legacy at risk.

‘Parents will be shocked that the Tory-led Government is still selling off playing fields.’ 

Details of plans to scrap rules on schools keeping a set amount of playing field space for team sports emerged on the eve of last year’s Olympics.

New rules that came into force months later stated only that ‘suitable’ outdoor space should be provided for sport and play.

Education secretary Michael Gove is under fire after it emerged that 17 school fields are closed every year, most in Conservative local authorities.

At the time, 35 applications to dispose of playing fields had been made – 30 by Tory councils, four by Labour-run authorities and one by a Lib Dem council.

The Education Secretary initially said 21 had been approved – only to have to apologise and say the figure was actually 30.

The deals included the sale of a football pitch to a developer by Barton Peveril Sixth Form College in Hampshire, whose former pupils include gold medal-winning cyclist Dani King.

Elliott School in Putney, south London, was allowed to sell five acres of fields with six tennis courts, a football pitch and a playground to make way for luxury housing.

Several sales have gone ahead against the advice of the independent playing fields panel.

Only five have been rejected by the Department for Education. The DfE claims the rule change is needed to allow more school places to be created quickly.

But Labour has warned that cuts in schools’ capital budgets are leading to ‘salami slicing’ of school pitches.

A total of 242 playing fields were sold off under Tony Blair or Gordon Brown from November 2001 to May 2010.

The DfE said last night that about two-thirds of disposals followed the closure or merger of schools.

A spokesman added: ‘The number of playing fields approved for disposal by the Government is falling.’

Several sales have gone ahead against the advice of the independent playing fields panel.

She said it was schools and their local authorities that proposed to convert this ‘often surplus or unused land to invest in sport or education’.

The charity Fields in Trust said the DfE was now more ‘transparent’ about the decisions.

But chief executive Helen Griffiths warned: ‘The focus now must be on ensuring that the growing body of [independently run] academies and free schools are subject to the same processes as local  education authority maintained schools.

‘There is great potential for playing field losses in these academic institutions to fall below the radar.’
