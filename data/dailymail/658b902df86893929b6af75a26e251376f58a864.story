Germany could win this World Cup, but they’ll face tougher tasks than the victory over Portugal.

They thrashed a team whose best defender was sent off in the first half, whose best player Cristiano Ronaldo wasn’t fully fit, and who had one of the least reliable goalkeepers I’ve seen at this tournament.

And of course the Germans did a bit of cheating to make sure they won.

Party time: Germany started their World Cup campaign by thrashing Portugal on Monday

Easy pickings: Germany made light work of Portugal but will face tougher tasks later in the tournament

The main culprit was Thomas Muller, yet he was hailed as world class after the game because of his hat-trick. A penalty, then a lucky ricochet that the keeper should have saved, and finally a tap in  - again from a goalkeeping error – those three goals do not come together to make a player world class. Muller is a modern day David Platt – a good player, effective in big games, but not quite world class. He could change that at this tournament. But there are better players in this Germany team, as most expert eyes can see.

Germany have looked excellent in spells at major tournaments, but without putting it together often enough to have an impact and win a trophy.

And that’s the point with Germany.

They’ve gone close, but not close enough. They haven’t won a trophy this century and they’ve not won a World Cup for a whole generation – 24 years.

They’ve stuck with Joachim Low since 2006 because it’s been a succession of near misses in tournaments. So far Low’s career as Germany coach since he took over could be headlined: 'They’re good, but they’re not quite Spain.'

Frustrations: Cristiano Ronaldo endured a difficult night as neither he nor his team-mates performed well

Flashpoint: Pepe put his head in while Thomas Muller was on the ground and was shown the red card

Off: Pepe's dismissal left Portugal with a mountain to climb in their opening match against Germany

Of course it’s better than England – but Germans don’t judge themselves by England’s low standards. They want excellence, they want to be champions, they’re winners. In England we would be absolutely delighted with semi-finals. The history of German football is very different – they expect to beat the best in the world, as happened in the 1974 World Cup final. You can have Maradona in your team, and the Germans will find a way to defeat you, as was the case in the 1990 World Cup final. Even teams at a particular tournament that are significantly better than Germany are defeated – witness England’s painful exit from Euro 96. Somehow the Germans found a way.

So far though, despite having a seemingly brilliant crop of players, Low hasn’t found a way. Will this tournament be the one? If Germany don’t win this World Cup, they may well go down as the nearly men, left wondering what could have been if only they’d had that little bit extra.

As one Germany fan told us on talkSPORT after the game: 'If it’s not this time – this crew has had it.'

Let’s see what they’ve got because for me Germany are the team under most pressure in Brazil, apart from the hosts.

Opener: Muller fired Germany ahead from the penalty spot in the early stages in Salvador

Doubling up: Muller notched his second, and Germany's third, to put his side in an unassailable position

Hat-trick hero: Muller completed his treble to establish himself as the tournament's leading scorer
