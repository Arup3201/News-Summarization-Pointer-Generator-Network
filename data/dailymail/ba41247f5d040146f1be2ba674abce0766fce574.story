A terror attack could be launched in the UK by Britons radicalised while fighting with rebels in Syria, William Hague warned today.

The Foreign Secretary said a 'substantial number' of British fighters had joined the battle to defeat president Bashar Assad, posing 'current and future risks to UK national security'.

It comes after the EU's counter terror chief  warned radicalised Europeans pose 'a serious threat when they get back' from Syria.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said 'substantial numbers' of British nationals had been attracted to  violent Islamist groups

Britain has promised to step up its support for the rebels, hinting that it could be ready to send arms.

But
 intelligence agencies have stepped up operations after a rise in the 
number of Europeans, notably from Britain, France and Ireland, joining 
fighters.

Security 
bodies are tracking Brits and Belgians while the Netherlands has raised 
its terror threat to ‘substantial’ in part because of fears about 
citizens being radicalised in Syria.

Mr Hague said: 'The conflict is precipitating a growth of extremism in Syria which poses current and future risks to UK national security.

'As the conflict has progressed, violent Islamist groups have been gaining ground in Syria and have attracted a large number of foreign fighters of all nationalities, including a substantial number of UK citizens.

'The overall number of foreign fighters travelling to Syria is greater than for all other areas of jihad combined. There is enough uncontested space in Syria for some violent Islamist groups to provide extensive training.

'This is particularly concerning as we assess some of the individuals being trained will seek to carry out attacks against Western interests in the region or in Western states now or in the future," he said in a letter to the foreign affairs committee.

He had challenged by MPs on the committee to justify a decision to push for the further easing or lifting of an EU arms embargo.

Britain and France are spearheading the move - which would allow the arming of rebel groups - but face opposition from partners concerned weapons could fall into the hands of jihadists.

Richard Ottaway, the Tory MP who chairs the committee, told Mr Hague in a letter last month that it was concerned the UK was 'out of step' with almost all European partners on the issue.

Europeans fighting with Syrian rebels are being radicalised by groups with links al-Qaeda, security chiefs have warned

European Union’s 
security chief Gilles de Kerchove also warned the fighters 
to bring down President Assad, including many Britons, will be 
‘radicalised’ before returning home where they will pose a ‘serious 
threat’ to national security.

It is feared some will become members of groups with links to al-Qaeda before launching terror attacks at home.

Mr de Kerchove, the EU’s counter-terrorism coordinator, said: ‘We are concerned, of course.’

He said most of the Europeans agreeing to fight with the rebels were being converted by radicals in Syria.

‘Not
 all of them are radical one day when they leave but most likely many of
 them will be radicalised there, they will be trained,’ he told the BBC.

‘And as we have seen in previous situations this might create a serious threat when they get back.’

Brits, French and Irish fighters are said to be among hundreds of Europeans in Syria. Rebels are pictured attending a training session in Maaret Ikhwan, near Idlib, Syria

Syrian President Bashar Assad has waged a bloody war against rebels seeking to depose him

The UK has already sent non-lethal equipment to rebels in Syria, including body armour and four-by-four vehicles, and there has been pressure from both the British and the French to lift an EU arms embargo against the country.

Foreign Secretary William Hague believes the few weeks are a crucial period in deciding what further action the international community can take.

Any shipment of weapons would have to be 
‘very carefully controlled’, Mr Hague said amid fears that arms could 
fall in to the hands of jihadists operating in the country.

EU Counter terrorism coordinator Gilles de Kerchove issued his warning as Foreign Secretary William Hague said the next few weeks would be crucial in the EU's plans to step up support for rebels

The Foreign Secretary told MPs: ‘The next few weeks are a very crucial period in this matter because we need to decide with our European Union partners, and indeed the United States, what are the next steps we can realistically take and should take in order to... strengthen the opposition on the ground and increase the incentives for a political settlement in Syria.

‘We have taken no decision about that but if we do so, I will come to the House of Commons and describe that decision.’

His comments followed a question in the Commons from Liberal Democrat former Leader Sir Menzies Campbell, who said ministers needed to state their position on Syria more clearly.

The language being used by ministers was ‘equivocal and delphic’, he said, adding the Government should seek the ‘express endorsement’ of MPs if there was ‘any material change in policy’.
