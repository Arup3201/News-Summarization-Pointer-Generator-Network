Almost 13,000 patients die needlessly from severe infections every year, experts warned yesterday.

A study found that opportunities to save lives lost to sepsis are missed because of delays in diagnosis and treatment.

The care failures are not only lethal, they cost the NHS more through longer hospital stays, according to research by the Health Service Ombudsman.

Sepsis, which is similar to septicaemia, happens when the immune system overreacts to an infection attacking organs such as the heart and liver.

Nearly 13,000 patients are dying needlessly from severe infections, say medical experts

It causes fever, inflammation and blood pressure and clotting problems that can lead to multiple organ failure.

The ombudsman’s report, published today for World Sepsis Day, looked in detail at ten cases in which patients died through medical failures in the critical first few hours.

Problems included lack of early diagnosis, failure to recognise the severity of the illness, delays in treatment, and delay in control of infection.

Julie Mellor, who was made health ombudsman in January 2012, said: ‘In the cases in our report, sadly, all patients died. In some of these cases, with better care and treatment, they may have survived.

‘It is time for the NHS to act to save lives by improving the care of patients with sepsis.’

Grandmother Hilary Lovell (right) lost her battle with sepsis on Christmas Day three years ago.

She had been feeling poorly the week before, but was diagnosed with flu by her GP.

On Christmas Eve  Mrs Lovell, 64, from Embsay, North Yorkshire, became delirious and an ambulance was called. She was immediately diagnosed with  sepsis by the medics.

The inflammation caused the grandmother-of-eight to have a heart attack and she died on Christmas morning, two days before her granddaughter Chloe’s first birthday.

Her daughter Rhiannon Oliver said: ‘All our lives changed that day. For me, I’d lost my mum and my best friend, my husband had lost a surrogate mum.

My children’s loss was the most wonderful and devoted Nanny. All in the space of six days.

‘I’d never heard of sepsis before and I only wish I knew then what I know now. Perhaps then my mum would still be here.’

Mrs Oliver said she believes more should be done to raise awareness among the public and the medical profession.

She added: ‘Both the public and the medics need education and awareness of the condition. If I’d have known what symptoms to look for the alarm bells would have rung and we could have sought help quicker.

‘All medics should receive training on entry at medical school. When an estimated 37,000 people a year are dying drastic action really is needed.’

Ron Daniels, of the UK Sepsis Trust, said at least 12,500 lives could be saved a year if hospitals improved their procedures.

‘The best hospitals have achieved better outcomes from sepsis by adopting a simple set of life-saving measures, collectively known as the Sepsis 6, and ensuring that a culture of awareness around sepsis has been created,’ he added.

‘We now need to spread this awareness to other health professionals and to the public.

‘The UK Sepsis Trust welcomes this excellent report from the ombudsman, which exposes common themes where care has failed.’

According to the Royal College of Physicians a doctor should not leave severe sepsis cases until antibiotics have been administered.

Intravenous antibiotics are the first line of treatment, along with oxygen, fluids and medication to increase blood pressure, but in many cases patients are not referred in time to critical care facilities.

Dialysis for kidney failure and breathing support for respiratory failure are necessary for the worst cases.

Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘This report shows the tragic consequences of sepsis and raises an important issue for everyone in health care.

‘It is vital that all staff are provided with training and support to enable them to recognise the signs and symptoms of sepsis, and crucially to know how to act quickly when sepsis is diagnosed.’

Experts say sepsis is becoming more common, partly because of a rising number of elderly people with weakened immune systems or underlying diseases such as cancer. The illness accounts for 100,000 hospital admissions each year, with around 37,000 people dying.

The most common causes are pneumonia, bowel perforation, urinary infection and severe skin infections.

Mike Durkin, who is director of patient safety for NHS England, said: ‘We all need in every setting to understand the importance of identifying deterioration in both adults and children, in reducing the admission of full-term babies to neonatal care and identifying problems in vulnerable older people in the first 48 hours of acute illness.’

Sepsis is different to septicaemia in that the infection is not limited to the blood and can be caused by a viral or fungal source as well as a bacterial one.
