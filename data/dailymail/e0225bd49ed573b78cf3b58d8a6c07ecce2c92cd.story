Google and Apple already want to be in your pocket and on your wrist, and for their next battle the rivals are gunning for your car's dashboard. 

2015 will be the year Android Auto and Apple's CarPlay systems roll out to more cars and reach the mainstream.

But concerns have already been raised about how dangerous the software is for drivers and how much the tech giants will be able to track owners.

Apple's contender: The firm first toyed with an in-car system at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June 2013. At that point it was known as 'iOS in the Car' but following changes in the design team the system was unveiled at last year's Geneva Motor Show, under the moniker CarPlay (Apple Maps on CarPlay pictured)

Google's fighter: Google used its  annual developer I/O in June to unveil Android Auto, a key feature of its latest operating system Android Lollipop. Android Auto works with any Android phone to show a user's information on the dashboard (Google Maps on Android Auto pictured) 

Apple first toyed with an in-car system at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June 2013. 

At that point it was known as 'iOS in the Car' but following changes in the design team the system was officially unveiled at last year's Geneva Motor Show, under the moniker CarPlay. 

Google used its own annual developer I/O in June to unveil Android Auto, a key feature of its latest operating system Android Lollipop. 

Android Auto works with any Android Lollipop phone to show information on the dashboard.

In April, Texas researchers found that using voice to send text messages while driving - on software such as Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers.

They found both methods impacted
 driver response times equally - but it often took voice 
recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages. 

While a separate study from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in the US, discovered that hands-free kits increase mental workload and distractions, causing reaction times to get slower and brain function to become compromised.

This results in drivers scanning the road less and potentially not seeing items right in front of them, including pedestrians. 

Rather than running its own operating system, the unit acts an external display for connected devices.

The software automatically starts when a user plugs in their phone, and Google has subsequently demonstrated how maps, Google Now cards and music will appear on the car's built-in screen through a series of promotional videos and trailers. 

Android Auto uses voice control for navigation, using Google Maps, and can read and reply to messages. 

Music is accessed through Google Play or the phone's music library.

Certain models of car will have a voice-activation button on the wheel, while others will respond automatically to 'OK Google.'

At the launch, Google's Patrick Brady said the firm will allow developers to build cars apps for audio and messaging applications and has signed up more than 28 car makers.

These include Abarth, Acura, Alfa Romeo, Audi, Bentley, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Jeep, Kia, Maserati, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, Ram, Renault, Seat, Skoda, Subaru, Suzuki, Volkswagen and Volvo. 

The first wave of Android Auto cars are 'coming soon', but they are expected to launch this year.  

Apple's integrated CarPlay system works in an almost identical way. Plugging an iPhone into the car starts the system.  

It works with the iPhone 5 up to the iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 7 and above, and features Siri Eyes Free - a voice-activated, hands-free way to use the system with Apple's Siri software.  

Once connected, Siri can be used to access the phone’s contacts, make calls, return missed calls and listen to voicemails.

Navigation uses Apple Maps, and music can be played through apps including Apple's own Beats Music, iHeartRadio, Spotify and Stitcher.

Both systems work with connected handsets and let drivers control maps, make calls (CarPlay pictured), open and respond to texts and play music using voice commands. In Apple CarPlay this is called Siri Eyes Free. CarPlay is compatible with the iPhone 5 and above while Android Auto works with Android Lollipop

Many car manufacturers will also include touchscreen controls, plus physical knobs and controls in their vehicles.

The first car to be sold with a fully-functioning version of CarPlay was Ferrari's FF unveiled in September. 

Earlier this month Hyundai confirmed its Sonata sedan will have the features by the end of March.

Other partners include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Citroen including its DS branch, Dodge, Fiat, Honda, Jaguar, Jeep, Kia, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, Renault, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.

Certain models of car (Kia example pictured) will have a voice-activation button on the wheel, while others will respond automatically to spoken commands such as 'OK Google'

And by 2016 all new Ford models are expected to have either Android Auto or CarPlay built-in.

But despite the promises from both firms in terms of adding easy-to-use, hands-free features, a recent study from Texas Transportation Institute found the technology may be as dangerous as texting.

This results in drivers scanning the road less and potentially not seeing items right in front of them, including pedestrians. 

Apple has not commented on the findings, but during a demonstration of Google's technology Andrew Brenner, the lead project manager of Android Auto, told the New York Times that no action on the system should take more than two seconds. 

This was designed to comply with the Transportation Department’s voluntary guidelines.

For example, there is no Back or Recents button, and the font on Google Maps is larger and less detailed to be less distracting. 

Video streaming is blocked, as is most social media, and texts will only be sent using voice commands.

And with the latest rumours about Apple's electric, self-driving car project Titan, both dashboard systems could be just the next step towards vehicles running solely on Android or iOS. 

Android Auto will also take advantage of Google Now (example pictured). Google Now scans calendar entries to work out where a user is, or should be. It combines this with location data from the phone's GPS, as well as posts on social networks and email. It then shows Cards designed to offer support it thinks the user needs

Apple said many cars will also include touchscreen controls, plus physical knobs and controls to make controlling CarPlay as easy as possible without distracting the driver. A recent study from Texas Transportation Institute found the technology may be as dangerous as texting

Reports claim Apple has several hundred employees developing its own electric car at a secret lab. 

Speculation was rife earlier this month when an Apple-owned car was spotted driving around California fitted with Street View-style cameras. Further cars were spotted in Florida and Hawaii. 

If Apple was developing such technology, it would would rival Google's self-driving cars. 

Google's head of self-driving cars recently said he expects people to be using them on public roads in two to five years.

Chris Urmson added the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians.

Similarly, Apple is said to be working on a release date of 2020 for its own range of vehicles. 

Other concerns around Android Auto, CarPlay and both firms entering the car market involve privacy and tracking.

Following users on their phones, into their cars as well as their homes, campaigners are worried the tech giants will have access to a wealth of personal information. 

But Mr Brenner responded: 'It’s exactly the same as having it in your pocket in your phone because it is on your phone.

So the same privacy controls that we have already for Google Now and for other third-party applications exist for this as well.'
