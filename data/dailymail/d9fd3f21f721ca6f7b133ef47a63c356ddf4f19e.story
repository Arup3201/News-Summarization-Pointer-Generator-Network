An inspirational teenager diagnosed with an incurable brain tumour has vowed to raise £50,000 to help prevent others from suffering her fate. 

Hannah Brown, 17, was diagnosed last February. Despite having chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she was told last month that the cancer has spread to her spine and is now incurable.

Since her diagnosis, family and friends say she has continued to be in high spirits - even sitting two GCSE exams - both of which she passed - in hospital the day after brain surgery.

And despite undergoing treatment and enduring countless operations, she has continued her studies, sporting activities and won the Prom Queen title at her school prom.

Miss Brown has now embarked on a fundraising campaign for the Parents’ Association of Children with Tumours and Leukaemia (PACT) - a charity which researches the disease - and wants to raise £50,000.

She said: 'I have tried to stay positive throughout. Just because I have cancer and you will see me with no hair, I am still the same person.

'I definitely don’t want to be treated any differently as I am still as positive as ever. I'll be raising money for my charity and doing things I’ve always wanted to do.'

Her parents, Vel and David, added: 'She’s been through operation after operation but she’s never complained - she just gets on with it.

'When we first found the tumour was cancerous there were a lot of tears from all of us, but Hannah just said: "Lets sort something out right now, the tears are finished, let’s just get on with it".

Hannah was diagnosed in February last year and had radiotherapy and chemotherapy but the cancer spread

'She says "I’m a warrior not a worrier" - and that sums up her attitude. We are so proud of Hannah. She’s an inspiration.'

Miss Brown's family are currently supporting her while gets second opinions on her diagnosis and considers treatment options.

Her brothers, Matthew, 23, and 26-year-old Craig, have also been inspired by their sister.

Craig said: 'Hannah is an inspiration to so many people. Throughout the last year, she has remained so strong and positive. More than anything else she wants to raise money for the charity.'

Hannah said: 'I have tried to stay positive throughout. Just because I have cancer and you will see me with no hair, I am still the same person'

Hannah sat two GCSEs in hospital the day after having brain surgery - and passed both of them

David Williams, principal at Ash Hill Academy in Hatfield, South Yorkshire, where Miss Brown attends, said: 'Hannah is a fantastic student who is continuing to work hard during her illness.

'She has an amazing personality and determination and this has been shown in her decision to fund raise for PACT. She is a credit to herself, her family and our academy.

'The academy is fully supportive of Hannah and her family in raising the funds for her chosen charity.'

PACT was formed in 1977 as a support group for families whose children had cancer. It now provides equipment to families and provides money for research into a cure for cancer.
