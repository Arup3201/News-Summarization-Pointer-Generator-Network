Bizarrely-placed election signs proved an unlikely internet hit today as voters went to the polls.

Twitter was inundated with placards placed in amusing spots - including bins, skips and roadworks.

One sign on a bin was shared with the comment: 'David Cameron has set up a special polling station for Ukip voters'.

In an election marked by voter apathy and bad weather, the pictures threatened to become a symbol of the public's damning view of politicians.

Spoof: Twitter users shared photos of bizarrely-placed polling station signs on voting day, including this work site

Other messages were slightly more cryptic, including this photo of a sign on a gun and one on a car
