Debbie Gallagher, 36, suffered devastating head injuries and died after accident while pregnant

A seven-months-pregnant mother who fell down the stairs in a catastrophic accident died a day after her baby girl was born by an emergency Caesarean section.

Debbie Gallagher was rushed to hospital after her partner Mike Faultless heard a bang and found her lying unconscious at their home in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands.

Doctors battled to save the 36-year-old, who had suffered a devastating head injury, thought to have been caused by striking the bannister, and her baby.

Daisy was delivered two months early on July 25, 2013, weighing 4lb 15oz, but tragically her mother could not be saved and died from her injuries the next day.

Mr Faultless, a Land Rover engineer, was left to bring up their baby daughter and his two step-children following the accident last year.

He said: ‘Daisy is such a beautiful little girl and I am so proud of her. I know Debbie would have been so proud too.

‘It was such a terrible time. There was the elation of seeing your little girl come into the world and then, just a day later, seeing the woman you love pass away.’

Mr Faultless, 40, said he went into shock when he saw his Ms Gallagher, who had worked as a stock controller at the Leisure Box in Birmingham, lying at the bottom of the stairs.

He said: ‘We had gone to bed saying how happy we were. Then there was a loud bang from downstairs that woke me up.

‘I shouted down for Debbie but I got no answer. I got up to find her and saw a figure lying at the bottom of the stairs.

‘I raced down to her and found blood coming from behind her ear. I was in total panic and shock.’

Mr Faultless has received support from Ms Gallagher’s friends in caring for Daisy as well as her other children, nine-year-old Bradley and Hanna, 17, who she previously adopted.

He added: ‘Debbie was a fun-loving woman who was happiest when having a party and dancing with family and friends.

‘She was a wonderful partner and mother and we planned to spend the rest of our lives together.’

Since her death, friends and family have raised almost £4,000 in her memory, which will be donated to the Intensive Care Unit at University Hospital in Coventry where she was treated.

Her father James Gallagher, his partner Lynn and her sister-in-law Rachael Faultless-Hodgson have been organising a number of events to raise money for the unit, including a sponsored walk and a 60s night.

The money donated to the hospital will be used to fund new equipment and facilities to enhance the care of ICU patients.
