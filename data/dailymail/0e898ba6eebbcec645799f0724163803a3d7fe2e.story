Deposed Libyan despot Colonel Muammar Gaddafi last night called on his followers to begin a 'guerilla war' against the rebel forces which have deposed him.

In a fiery broadcast from his desert hiding place, the colonel warned that loyalist tribes in his remaining strongholds were armed and preparing for battle.

'We will fight them everywhere,' he said. 'We will burn the ground under their feet.'

An image grab from Syrian-based Arrai television shows a picture of Muammar Gaddafi as he allegedly gives an audio message yesterday to mark the 42nd anniversary of the coup which brought him to power. Writing on screen reads in Arabic 'Libyan combatant leader Muammar Gaddafi: men and women of Libya prepare to resist as your grandfathers and fathers did before you... Prepare for a long war that was imposed on us.'

Gaddafi told listeners that the rebellion against his 42-year rule was a plot by Nato, who planned to occupy Libya and steal its oil wealth.

'Get ready for the occupation. ... Get ready for a long war, imposed on us,' he railed. 'Get ready for the guerilla war.'

The city of Sirte, a stronghold of the Gaddafi clan and the colonel's hometown, had become 'the capital of the resistance', he said.

The rebels, led by the east-Libya based National Transitional Council, dismissed the fugitive leader's threats as empty rhetoric.

But they have extended a deadline for the surrender of Sirte in the hope of avoiding the bloodshed that met their attack on Tripoli.

'We want to save our fighters and not lose a single one in battles with Gaddafi's forces,' said Mohammed al-Rajali, a spokesman for the rebel leadership in Benghazi.

'In the end, we will get Sirte, even if we have to cut water and electricity.'

The rebels have been hunting Gaddafi since he fled into hiding after they swept into Tripoli on August 20 and, after days of fierce fighting, gained control of most of the capital.

They claim the advance on Sirte is going well, and that their forces have already captured one nearby city.

They also claim they are closing in on
Gaddafi, who came to power 42 years ago Thursday in a military coup 
that toppled the western-backed King Idris.

But the on-the-run dictator remained defiant.

'We won't surrender again; we are not women. We will keep fighting,' Gaddafi earlier said in a blustery tone in an audio statement, broadcast by Syrian-based Al-Rai TV.

His voice was recognisable, and Al-Rai has previously broadcast statements by Gadhafi and his sons.

Gaddafi claimed the tribes in Sirte and Bani Walid are armed and 'there is no way they will submit.' Calling for continued resistance, he warned: 'the battle will be long and let Libya burn.'

The rebels believe Gaddafi may be hiding out in one of their three key targets.

Their fighters, backed by Nato airstrikes, have been pushing recently toward Sirte as well as Bani Walid, 90 miles south-east of Tripoli, and the southern city of Sabha.

The colonel's forces still control most of Sabha and large numbers of soldiers - including mercenaries from other African countries - are camped on its outskirts, said Abdul Awidat, a Sabha resident currently in Tripoli.

Mr Awidat said he had spoken to people in the Sabha area by phone in the past two days who said pro-Gaddafi fores had taken up positions in the city.

They are recruiting young men as fighters and handing out weapons but, he added, 'there is no information that Gaddafi or any of his senior leadership are in Sabha.'

Some anti-government protesters have taken over a small part of the town of Gorda, and there has been fighting in the area with several people killed, Awidat said.

He said there is no electricity, running water or regular telephone service, and medicine is running out.

Many rebels now believe Gaddafi could be evading capture by moving underground in his 'Great Man-Made River', the project which allowed him to pump water from 2,500ft below the Sahara Desert and transport it to towns and cities on the Mediterranean coast.

It is thought he may have used the huge subterranean network to flee Tripoli without being spotted.

The 15ft pipelines dwarf the network of tunnels which have been discovered under the Gaddafi compound in central Tripoli, which are thought to extend for several miles.

The irrigation system connects Tripoli with a network of towns including Bani Walid in the south – where several members of the Gaddafi family have been spotted since Tripoli fell under rebel control.

Gaddafi loyalists still control Bani Walid, and rebels claim the soldiers turned off the pipeline temporarily to allow the family to escape, disrupting Tripoli’s water supply.

In a boost to the rebel cause, the last prime minister under Gaddafi, Al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi, yesterday told Al-Arabiya television he now supports the opposition.

He said he had been in contact with the rebels 'and we notified them that we are with the people and we are ready to serve our country in the future.'

Meanwhile, Ahmed Said, an adviser to the interior minister in the rebels' interim government, said Gaddafi's foreign minister had been captured.

He did not identify him by name, but 'can confirm that he is in custody.'

And in a further blow to Gaddafi, Algeria, which gave refuge to his wife and three of his children this week, has indicated it will not do the same for the longtime dictator.

The Algerian newspaper El Watan reported Gaddafi had also sought sanctuary in Algeria, but the president refused to take his phone calls.

Asked yesterday if Gaddafi could be given asylum, Algerian foreign minister Mourad Medelci said: 'I don't believe so.'

In Paris, international leaders gathered yesterday for the 'Friends of Libya' summit to discuss support for the country's interim government.

Prime Minister David Cameron insisted Libya was on the 'brink of success' after more than 60 representatives from Nato and the UN made a series of commitments to help support the new Libyan goverment.

They include continuing with Nato operations, bringing those guilty of war crimes to justice and supporting the NTC to achieve political transition.

Mr Cameron, who chaired the summit with French president Nicolas Sarkozy, said the commitments made at the summit yesterday were right because 'we cannot have a failed, pariah state on Europe's borders'.

The conference, held in the Elysee Palace, unanimously agreed the need to hand over frozen Libyan assets to the NTC.

International assistance is desperately needed in Libya, which faces critical shortages of drinking water, food, fuel and medicine, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator for the country has said.

The six-month conflict between rebels and Gaddafi's forces has seriously disrupted supply lines and devastated the country's infrastructure.

Panos Moumtzis said more than half a dozen UN agencies have returned to Tripoli to address the country's humanitarian needs since fighting in the capital waned last week.

Mr Moumtzis said the UN has brought in 11million bottles of water and will bring in 600 metric tons of food and £88million worth of medicine.

He said, however, that he sees the UN aid as temporary, and that he expects oil-rich Libya to be able fund its own recovery starting in 2012.
