Comeback: Lois Goodman, 71, will referee at the upcoming US Open a year after she was arrested for killing her elderly husband, only to be cleared in the death

The professional tennis referee who was charged of bludgeoning her husband to death with a coffee cup last year will return to the US Open this month after being cleared in the death.

In August of last year, then-70-year-old Lois ‘Lolo’ Goodman was marched out of a New York City hotel in handcuffs after being accused of killing her 80-year-old spouse, Alan, by hitting him with a mug and then using the broken shards to stab him.

The umpire insisted she was innocent, and her lawyers suggested Mr Goodman died in an accidental fall at the couple's Woodland Hills home in California last April.

Prosecutors dismissed charges four months later, saying they had received new information and had insufficient evidence to charge her.

Goodman's daughter, Joan, told the New York Post that her mother is anxious about making a comeback to the prestigious tennis event scheduled to begin August 26, and she is hoping to stay out of the spotlight.

‘She is grateful she has her job, and she wants to be able to do it without distraction,' Joan Goodman told the paper.

The news of Miss Goodman’s return to US Open comes just days after the 71-year-old referee sued the Los Angeles Police Department, the county coroner's department, and others for false arrest and malicious prosecution.

Falsely accused: Lois Goodman, seen after her arrest in New York last August, has always maintained her innocence in connection to her husband's death in April 2012

Lois Goodman has alleged in a federal lawsuit released by her attorney Friday that she suffered humiliation, damage to her career and physical pain from her confinement in jail when first arrested in August 2012.

Attorney Robert Sheahan said his client suffered the trauma of finding her spouse of nearly 50 years dead, only to have the grieving period curtailed by being arrested and thrown in a jail he describes as ‘a veritable dungeon.’

The 21-page complaint states that the septuagenarian was subjected to emotional distress when police waited until she had traveled to New York to referee the US Open and conducted her arrest in front of media at a New York hotel.

‘Instead of calling Mrs. Goodman or her attorney, they waited until she traveled to New York to officiate at the US Open tennis tournament. Then, traveling to New York on “official business,” LAPD defendants alerted the national media and publicly arrested Mrs. Goodman in New York City, where they caused her to be incarcerated at Rikers Island,’ the complaint states, according to the Courthouse News Service.

Cleared: Lois Goodman addresses the media after all charges were dropped in a preliminary hearing at the Van Nuys Courthouse last November

Arrest: Goodman was officiating qualifying matches at the U.S Open over the summer when she was arrested by police for the murder of her husband Alan, seen here

Fatal injury: Mr Goodman died after suffering 'deep penetrating blunt force trauma'

Goodman was officiating qualifying 
matches at the US Open last summer when she was arrested by police 
for the murder of her husband Alan, who died after suffering 'deep 
penetrating blunt force trauma.'

Furthermore, Goodman claims that the LAPD knowingly lied to the media, telling them that the 70-year-old woman was having an affair and an Internet relationship with two US Open officials

She accused a police officer of trying to pressure her to confess and said the coroner's finding of homicide was wrong.

According to the federal suit, Mr. Goodman ‘was legally blind and had colon cancer...had a long history of high blood pressure, heart disease, depression and insulin-dependent diabetes [and] a history of failing to take his medication.’

Defense attorneys later revealed that her DNA wasn't found on the coffee mug found next to her husband’s body.

Goodman said she spent over $100,000 on her defense, borrowing and selling assets to cover costs. She hired a renowned medical examiner and a polygraph expert to help show her innocence.

After the dismissal she was reinstated as a referee but said she drew less important assignments than before.

‘To this day, Mrs. Goodman suffers on a daily basis,’ said the lawsuit. ‘The public humiliation is unending. There are whispers and pointed fingers wherever she goes.’

Although the suit said her reputation has suffered, the attorney who won her dismissal, Alison Triessl, said Goodman will be working in referee duties at the upcoming US Open.

Wrongfully blamed: 'I didn't know what they were thinking,' Lois Goodman said during an interview this morning. 'I'm a spouse and they didn't have anyone else to blame so came after me.'

Thankful: Ms Goodman thanked her attorneys Robert Sheahen and Alison Triessl, seen here with Matt Lauer on The Today Show, and said she would have been in a lot of trouble without them

The 71-year-old Goodman had been 
accused of bludgeoning her 80-year-old husband to death with a coffee 
cup. She said she was innocent and her lawyers suggested Alan Goodman 
died in an accidental fall.

The couple had been married 50 years 
and had three grown daughters. They had lived in the San Fernando Valley
area of Los Angeles their entire lives.

Alan Goodman died in April. 
Authorities initially believed he fell down stairs at home while his 
wife was away but later decided it was homicide after a mortuary 
reported suspicious injuries on his head.

They then alleged he had been 
clobbered on the head with a coffee mug and began to treat Goodman as a 
suspect.

But defense lawyers said there was 
little forensic evidence in the case because of the delay in the 
investigation.

Lois Goodman later had passed polygraph
tests supporting her claim of innocence.

She was arrested by Los Angeles 
police in New York August 20, 2012, as she arrived to be a line judge in the 
US Open. She made her first court appearance wearing her tennis 
uniform.

Goodman, who has refereed matches between some of tennis's greatest players, pleaded not guilty.

After a brief stay in jail, she had 
been released on electronic monitoring and subsequently came to court 
for pretrial hearings with friends and family there to support her.

Last November, the case against Goodman 
was dropped after the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said they 'could not proceed.'
