She has never been shy of showing off a new look. But it is not only Victoria Beckham’s fashion sense that has changed over the years – her bust size has had its ups and downs too.

Now the former Posh Spice appears to have had the last vestiges of her breast implants removed.

The 38-year-old showed off the results in a light strappy top as she took her four children to lunch in Los Angeles.

Her much-reduced cleavage was a far 
cry from the pneumatic look she sported as she cheered on England during
the World Cup in Germany in 2006, and appeared even flatter than her 
drastically reduced bust of four years ago.

She
reportedly had her first breast reduction procedure in 2009, taking 
them from an artificial 34DD to a slightly more natural 34B.

Now,
it appears Mrs Beckham, who had her fourth child, daughter Harper, in 
2011, has reverted to the original 34A size she displayed as a young 
Spice Girl in the 1990s.

Mrs Beckham, whose husband David now 
plays for Paris Saint-Germain after five years with LA Galaxy, is 
believed to have had her initial breast enlargement following the birth 
in 1999 of her first son, Brooklyn.

According to her biographer Andrew Morton, she had them increased to a 34D at a London clinic at a cost of £10,000.

In 2001, it was reported she had a second operation to enlarge her bust size to 34DD. Publicly, Mrs Beckham, who also has sons Romeo, ten, and Cruz, eight, has always denied going under the knife.

In September 2001, she insisted her inflated look was down to tape and push-up bras.

And in an interview with Piers Morgan for the BBC’s Tabloid Tales in April 2003, she said: ‘I’m completely natural, except for my fingernails and I have a bit of help with my hair and a bit of a St Tropez [fake tan] going on.’

However, in 2005 Mrs Beckham’s lawyers admitted that the denials were untrue and that she ‘had in fact undergone breast enhancement surgery’.

Mrs Beckham, now a fashion designer, has admitted to cringing at photos showing her inflated bust.

She once told an interviewer: ‘I’ve worn so many dresses in the past and when I see the photographs I think, crikey, my boobs are up round my neck again.’

Mrs Beckham’s spokesman declined to comment yesterday.
