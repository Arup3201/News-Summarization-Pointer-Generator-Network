For decades scientists believed that dinosaurs were cold blooded. This is because many were thought to have been direct descendants of cold-blooded reptiles such as crocodiles.

New research from scientists at the University of Adelaide casts serious doubts on this theory and they claim dinosaurs such as the Tyrannosaurus Rex were actually warm blooded like birds and mammals.

The researchers add that if the dinosaurs did have cold blood they have would not have had the required muscular power to prey on other animals as they did throughout the Mesozoic period, and could not have competed well against mammal-like dinosaurs of the same size.

Dinosaurs living during the Mesozoic period - between 252 and 66 million years ago - include the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Stegosaurus and Brontosaurus.

The current school of thought believes that dinosaurs behaved like saltwater crocodiles.

Large saltwater 
crocodiles can achieve a body temperature above 30 degrees by basking in the 
sun, and it can maintain the high temperature overnight simply by being 
large and slow to change temperature.

Scientists believe that cold blooded 
dinosaurs could have done the same and enjoyed a warm body temperature 
without the need to generate the heat in their own cells through burning
food energy like warm blooded animals.

However, Professor Roger Seymour from Adelaide University's School of Earth and Environmental Sciences questions how much muscular power could be produced by a cold-blooded crocodile-like dinosaur compared to a mammal-like dinosaur of the same size.

In his paper, Professor Seymour demonstrated that a 
200kg crocodile can produce only about 14 per cent of the 
muscular power of a mammal at peak exercise and this fraction seems to 
decrease at larger body sizes.

The saltwater crocodile is the largest of all living reptiles and the largest terrestrial and riparian predator in the world.

They live in salt water, mangrove swamps, estuaries, deltas, lagoons and parts of rivers.

The males grow to seven metres long and weigh as much as 2,000 kg.

They have the strongest bite of any animal today and are ambush predators.

Saltwater crocodiles are about 50 per cent muscle but produce less power than a mammal at peak exercise.

Saltwater crocodiles can weigh over a tonne and being about 50 per cent muscle, have a reputation for being extremely powerful animals.

However, they are not as powerful as they look.

Scientists at Monash University, the University of California and Wildlife Management International in the Northern Territory drew from blood and muscle lactate measurements from the crocodiles.

Professor Roger Seymour of the University's School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, said: 'Much can be learned about dinosaurs from
fossils but the question of whether dinosaurs were warm blooded or 
cold blooded is still hotly debated among scientists.'

'The results further show that 
cold blooded crocodiles lack not only the absolute power for exercise, 
but also the endurance, that are evident in warm blooded mammals,' said 
Professor Seymour.

Cold blooded crocodiles lack the power for exercise and the endurance that are evident in warm-blooded mammals. A crocodile-like dinosaur could not compete well against a mammal-like dinosaur of the same size, said Professor Seymour

'So, despite the impression that saltwater crocodiles are extremely powerful animals, a crocodile-like dinosaur could not compete well against a mammal-like dinosaur of the same size.

'Dinosaurs dominated over mammals in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the Mesozoic.

To do that they must have had more muscular power and greater endurance than a crocodile-like physiology would have allowed.'

His latest evidence adds to that of earlier work he did on blood flow to leg bones, which concluded that the dinosaurs were possibly even more active than mammals.
