Louis van Gaal was left bemused after his weekly press conference at Manchester United’s Carrington training base on Friday was interrupted by an announcement over the public address system calling for a masseur!

The Dutchman was answering questions about Saturday’s Premier League trip to Aston Villa when the sound of his voice was drowned out by the request for the masseur to go to the first-team dressing room.

‘It’s an emergency?’ asked a confused Van Gaal. ‘No? It’s a joke?’ The United boss was reassured that the announcement was genuine but should not have been heard in the press conference room.

The Old Trafford boss also became irritated when asked about Victor Valdes, and whether Liverpool could revive their interest in the former Barcelona goalkeeper if United do not offer him a contract.

‘It's only talk from you,’ said Van Gaal. ‘Not from us, not from Victor Valdes, not from no-one, only the media. I am not here to inform the media. You have to wait and listen and see and that's it.

‘OK, then he goes to Liverpool. Yeah, when you see that. But you are suggesting and it's a big mistake to do that as the media. There are no stories. He is training here. I give him the possibility and then we shall see.’
