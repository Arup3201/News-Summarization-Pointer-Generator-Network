A backlash against U.S. gun culture appears to have started in Hollywood and the business world  in the wake of the Sandy Hook school massacre.

Scenes have reportedly been cut from the new Tom Cruise film Jack Reacher with movie studio Paramount moving swiftly to review its promotional materials before the picture's release on Friday.

It follows gunman Adam Lanza killing of 26 people in cold blood, including 20 children 1st grade children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut last Friday.

Paramount has decided to make several tweaks to the marketing materials for Jack Reacher, the gritty crime-action pic starring Cruise as a hard-boiled former military cop trying to prove that an alleged sniper was framed.

The studio wouldn't officially say what the changes are, but a source told The Hollywood Reporter that a scene of Cruise's character firing off a semi-automatic weapon is being cut from promotional spots.

Jack Reacher, rated PG-13 and opening with sniper fire, isn't the only Christmas movie laced with violence.

Django Unchained, opening Christmas Day, is directed by Quentin Tarantino, known for his over-the-top violence. The R-rated Django stars Jamie Foxx as a slave promised his freedom if he helps a bounty hunter played by Christoph Waltz track down a plantation owner played by Leonardo DiCaprio.

Yesterday, The Weinstein Co announced it was cancelling tonight's Django premiere in Los Angeles because of the school tragedy.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, and in this time of national mourning we have decided to forgo our scheduled event,' the company said in a statement, adding that it would still hold a screening for cast and crew.

At a junket for Django on Saturday in New York, Tarantino said he is weary of defending the violence in his movies.

'I just think there's violence in the world. Tragedies happen,' the filmmaker said. '[Django} is a Western. Give me a break.'

In scrubbing the Django premiere, The Weinstein Co. was following the cue of Paramount, which postponed Saturday's planned Jack Reacher premiere in Pittsburgh until Wednesday.

It was also revealed the business world has reacted to the massacre with U.S. private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management saying it will sell its stake in the maker of the AR15 rifle, the weapon used in the Newtown school shootings.

Cerberus Capital Management's move came after pressure from one of its own biggest investors, the California State Teachers' Retirement System (Calstrs).

Cerberus bought Bushmaster in 2006, and more gunmakers since, merging them into Freedom Group, which it will now sell.

The firm said it wanted to avoid being drawn into the gun control controversy.

'We believe that this decision allows us to meet our obligations to the investors whose interests we are entrusted to protect without being drawn into the national debate that is more properly pursued by those with the formal charter and public responsibility to do so,' Cerberus said in a statement.

'We do not believe that Freedom Group or any single company or individual can prevent senseless violence or the illegal use or procurement of firearms and ammunition,' the firm added, noting that Freedom Group only sold weapons to federally licensed dealers and distributors, and not directly to U.S. citizens.

Freedom Group claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of commercial firearms, selling over two billion rounds of ammunition each year.

As well as Bushmaster, the maker of the AR15 rifle, Freedom Group also owns Remington, the oldest U.S. gunmaker established in 1816, and seven other gun arms manufacturers, as well as majority stakes in two clothing companies specialising in hunting and paramilitary apparel.

The group made profits before tax of $2.7million in the 12 months to September 2012, on $875million of sales.

Calstrs, which is the second largest pension fund in the U.S., had said on Monday that it was reviewing its own $750million (£460million) investment in Cerberus in light of the deaths of 20 school children and seven adults including teachers at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut last Friday.

Cerberus, which is one of the biggest private equity firms in the world with over $20bn of assets under management, said that the shootings represented 'a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level'.

Proceeds from the sale of Freedom Group would be returned to Cerberus' investors, and not reinvested by the firm.

According to CNN, Dick's Sporting Goods,
 one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the world, has removed 
all guns from its store nearest to Newtown, Connecticut, and is 
suspending the sale of certain kinds of semi-automatic rifles from its 
chains nationwide.

Lanza reportedly tried to buy a gun from
 a Dick's Sporting Goods store in the city of Danbury, about 12 miles 
away from Newtown, prior to the killings.

The company said the reports hadn't 
been confirmed but it was suspending the sale of so-called 'modern 
sporting rifles' out of respect for the victims and families of the 
Sandy Hook school shooting.

Meanwhile, Walmart has taken the assault-rifle model Lanza used to gun down his victims off its online store.

According to the New York Post, the
 rifle had been available on Walmart's website until Monday afternoon. 
But the listing suddenly disappeared after thenation.com reported that 
scores of the frightening semi-automatic weapon were being sold through 
the retail giant's site.

Thenation.com said the model was available at 1,700 Walmart stores across the country.

It's not clear how Lanza's gun 
enthusiast mother, Nancy, got her hands on the Bushmaster rifle, a 
civilian version of an assault rifle used by troops fighting in the Iraq
 and Afghanistan.
