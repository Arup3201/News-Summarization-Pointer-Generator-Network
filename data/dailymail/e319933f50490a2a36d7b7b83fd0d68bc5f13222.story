Two New Jersey boys abducted by their father five weeks ago have been found in Florida staying in a hotel room with a fugitive wanted for child sex crimes in Tennessee. 

Parker Kristopher Dohm, 8, and his brother Jaxon Baily Dohm, 7, were found at the Royal Palm Inn in New Port Richey a little after 10pm on Wednesday night.

Now their father, Kristopher Dohm, is in the Pasco County Jail, while their mother, Sandra, is flying down to be reunited with the boys.

Dohm's friend, Edward Tarras Jr., who faces nearly two dozen sex-related charges, including sexual exploitation of a minor, was also arrested after the joint investigation by federal, state and local law enforcement.

Distraught: Ms Hughes Dohm had released a heart-wrenching video (pictured) begging for the return of her  sons, whom she thought may have had their appearances altered by her former husband

Tarras missed a court date in August and police in Tennessee said at the time that he cut off an ankle monitor and fled town, investigators said. He was then listed as one of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's most wanted fugitives.

He was tracked down after his cellphone was traced to Florida by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Marshals service, according to Sgt. Bobby Gibson with the Smyrna police department in Tennessee. He said the two were friends from growing up together in New Jersey.

Prosecutors previously said Tarras had lured teen girls through an Internet ad seeking models to photograph.

Tarras was appointed a public defender Thursday and was ordered held without bond in his first court appearance. 

Both men were jailed at the Pasco County Central Detention Center. Dohm also was being held without bond.

Dohm's sons were reported missing by their mother February 9 after she said they weren't returned home by their father in violation of a custody agreement. 

According to NJ.com, Kristopher had been planning the abduction for some time. 

Sandra  reported Parker and Jackson missing on February 9 after her former husband failed to return them to her New Jersey home.

'Abducted': In her video, posted on YouTube , Ms Hughes Dohm told her ex-husband: 'Kris, you need to bring them back home. You should not have taken them from me... they need their mother.' Above, the two boys

Together: Addressing her sons, she added: 'Parker and Jackson, I love you dearly. If you can pick up a phone and call me, or call the police, or tell somebody, ask for help. I'm looking for you every day, every night'

The boys had been scheduled to stay with their father for a week under a custody agreement that was made during the couple's 2012 divorce, but Kristopher had been required to bring them home that Sunday night.

Instead however, he abducted Parker, who has asthma, and Jaxon and drove out of the state in his 2009 grey Nissan Pathfinder, swapping out his license plate with stolen plates along the way to avoid detection.

Sandra released a heart-wrenching video begging for the return of her two sons earlier this week, noting that they may have had their appearances altered by Dohm, who suffers from diabetes.

In the footage, posted on YouTube, the distraught mother, who shares custody of the boys with Dohm, tells her ex-husband: 'Kris, you need to bring them back home. They need their mother.'

Addressing the boys, she adds: 'Parker and Jackson, I love you dearly. If you can pick up a phone and call me, or call the police, or tell somebody, ask for help. I'm looking for you every day, every night.

'I love you and I will never, ever stop looking for you. Please come home soon and safe.' 

Ms Hughes Dohm had also released some personal details about her children in the hope that the public may be able to help in locating them, including their nicknames and their favorite restaurants.

In a post on a dedicated Facebook page, called Help Find Parker And Jaxon Dohm, on Saturday, the mother-of-two wrote: 'It has now been 5 weeks since I last spoke to my Parker and my Jaxon.'

'Kris may call Parker by Park, Parker Choo, Chewy or Moose. He may call Jaxon by Jax, Action or Action Jaxon. Parker and Jaxon LOVE Taco Bell - they prefer the Dorito Tacos and soft tacos. 

'They also like McDonalds, Italian Subs from QuickChek and Slurpees from 7-Eleven.' She added: We have a lot of eyes out there and I ask that you continue to keep watching out for them.'

Last week, Thomas McCormick, Chief of Detectives at the Sussex County Prosecutor's Office, said the alleged abduction may have been an attempt by Dohm to gain custody of the two youngsters.

'We believe, based on recent information regarding their father's medical condition, that he may not be making great decisions,' Chf McCormick said. 'We believe that their [the boys'] safety could be at risk.' 

According to prosecutor Francis Koch, Dohm had allegedly asked his former wife for a few extra days with his sons so that he could fly them to Reno, Nevada, to visit 'his dying father.'.

However, investigators later found that Parker and Jaxon's grandfather was not dying, while no legitimate travel plans were made, Ms Koch said.

Arrest warrants were quickly issued.

On February 20, a federal warrant for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution was put out for Dohm.

Nine days earlier, a state arrest warrant had been issued for interference with custody.

A vehicle matching the description of Dohm's Nissan Pathfinder had been seen in the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore, Maryland, early on February 6, though there had been no further sightings.

It is not known at this time who alerted authorities to the boys location, or if their father did in fact alter their appearance in any way. 

Change? Police believe the boys' appearances may have been changed following their alleged kidnapping. Above, Jackson (left) and Parker (right) are seen before their disappearance and in digitally-altered photos
