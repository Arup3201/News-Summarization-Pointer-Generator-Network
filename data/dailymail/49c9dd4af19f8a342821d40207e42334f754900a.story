The growing number of MPs who fear Miliband is leading them to defeat have missed their chance to remove him

If Ukip pulls off an unlikely victory in tomorrow’s by-election in the Labour stronghold of Heywood & Middleton the clamour for Ed Miliband to be replaced as party leader will be deafening.

Former ministers and senior backbenchers will take to the airwaves to demand the departure of Miliband, who is trailing David Cameron badly in the polls. But they will be whistling in the wind and Miliband knows it.

Unlike the Tories, who ruthlessly dispatch leaders, as Margaret Thatcher found to her cost, the Labour Party is sentimental about failing leaders. Think Neil Kinnock and Michael Foot. The party’s rules state challengers must come forward before conference and be supported by 20 per cent of the Parliamentary Labour Party.

So the growing number of Labour MPs who fear Miliband is leading them to defeat missed their moment. Conference was nearly two weeks ago. There is a bitter irony in their failure to wield the knife. They were hoping Miliband would deliver another game-changing conference speech. Last year, his promise to cap energy prices caught the Tories unaware and Labour surged in the polls.

The policy, like so many of Miliband’s promises, soon unravelled.

This time, he confounded expectations yet again, but for the wrong reasons. His Manchester speech was a catastrophe. His inexplicable omission of any mention of the deficit and immigration will haunt him until polling day.

The small team around Miliband, which is weak and accident prone, was excluded from the crucial final drafting of the speech – arguably the most important of his leadership.

Bizarrely, Miliband shut himself away for a week beforehand with Marc Stears, an Oxford academic, who is his closest friend.

By turning his back on his few remaining loyal supporters at Westminster, Miliband cemented his growing political isolation.

Over the past week, Labour donors and virtually all the party’s London mayoral hopefuls have joined the criticism of Miliband by denouncing his flagship mansion tax proposal. Margaret Hodge, the influential Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, who also disowned the policy, repeatedly refused to say she was confident Labour would win the next election when she spoke at a fringe event at the conference.

As the noises off grow, there has been a conspicuous silence from Miliband’s so-called supporters, who clearly realise the game is up.

Panic is gripping Miliband’s office. Preparations for the Rochester and Strood by-election, caused by the defection to Ukip of the Tory MP Mark Reckless, are in chaos.

A well-sourced report by Mark Ferguson, editor of the grass-roots blog LabourList, said: ‘Senior Labour figures have sought to dampen expectations that Labour could win the seat. Don’t expect Labour to be throwing resources at the coming by-election.’

Lord Prescott, former deputy leader and Miliband loyalist, added to the ill ease when he wrote in the Sunday Mirror that Labour had given up on outright victory: ‘Ed Miliband might as well have said, “Go back to your constituencies and prepare for coalition”.’

The crisis deepened with reports yesterday suggesting Alan Johnson, the former Home Secretary, is being urged to stand as leader.

And ominously for Miliband, the arch-Blairite Lord Mandelson is devoting his still considerable energies to grooming the next generation of rising stars. His preferred choice is Chuka Umunna, 35, the party’s business spokesman.

Having got it wrong last time Labour MPs know they can’t afford another mistake.

Some still cling to the forlorn hope that Miliband will do the right thing and resign.

But Ed is ruthless, as his brother discovered, and he is staying put – to the huge relief of David Cameron.
