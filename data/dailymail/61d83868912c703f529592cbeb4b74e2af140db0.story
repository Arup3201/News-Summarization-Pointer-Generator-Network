David Cameron was accused of being 'up to his neck' in the Swiss bank account row today, after revelations that a string of Tory donors hoarded money in the country.

Former Conservative Party Treasurer Stanley Fink and  German-born car manufacturing heir Georg von Opel, who has donated six-figure sums to the Tories, are among a host of individuals who legally held accounts in Switzerland with HSBC's private bank, according to a leaked tax disc.

In a fiery Commons debate, the Prime Minister insisted 'no-one had done more' than the current government to crack down on tax avoidance.

But Mr Miliband said the PM was 'bang to rights', adding: 'He can't get away from it – he's a dodgy Prime Minister, surrounded by dodgy donors.'

It came before tax officials at HMRC were hauled before a Commons committee this afternoon over its 'pathetic' failure to tackle tax avoidance.

Chief executive Lin Homer was accused of letting people 'get away with it', by Public Accounts Committee chair Margaret Hodge.

Mrs Hodge said: 'You are not serving the British taxpayer.' But Mrs Homer responded: 'That is absolutely not the case.'

HMRC bosses knew about the HSBC tax scandal eight months before the bank's chairman was appointed as a Government minister.

The agency received a copy of the list of clients with millions stashed away in Switzerland before Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint was brought in to government in January 2011.

Labour said it 'beggared belief' that HMRC would not have reported to the Chancellor about problems at the bank when it began investigating the individuals concerned for tax evasion.

Today's debate, during Prime Minister's Questions, became so heated the Commons Speaker John Bercow was forced to intervene

Peers named in the HSBC files include Lord Sterling of Plaistow, the P&O shipping and ports entrepreneur who was ennobled by Margaret Thatcher, and Lord Fink, who was a party treasurer under David Cameron and has given £3m to the Conservatives.

MP for Richmond Park, Zac Goldsmith, alongside his financier brother Ben Goldsmith, also held accounts with HSBC's private Swiss bank, according to the Guardian.

But Mr Goldsmith issued a statement saying: 'I have never had a Swiss bank account, and do not control any Swiss bank accounts. 

'I have never sought or been given tax minimisation advice by HSBC, directly or indirectly. The media commentary around this is therefore wrong.'

The Conservatives have raised over £5m from HSBC clients recorded with Swiss accounts, while Labour has also benefited from cash and gifts in kind worth over £500,000, as well as a loan for £2m.

Labour donors who held Swiss accounts with HSBC include the steel magnate Swraj Paul and restaurant owner and clothing entrepreneur Richard Caring, who at various times is recorded to have donated to both Labour and the Conservatives.

HMRC was asked to vet Lord Green before his appointment, but only about his personal tax arrangements.

That was despite a formal investigation by HMRC into the HSBC accounts from at least as early as October 2011.

But Downing Street insisted ministers knew nothing about the client list when Mr Cameron made Stephen Green a Tory peer and then trade minister.

The revelation that thousands of 'black' accounts were used to stash millions and avoid tax has caused outrage.

Bank records were stolen by a whistleblower in 2007, but did not reach Britain until 2010 after a deal between HMRC and the French authorities.

Officials say part of the deal was that the taxman could not pass on the details – but they have since been leaked.

Since then only one person has been prosecuted despite £135million being recovered.

Speaking in Prime Minister's Questions today, Mr Miliband accused the Prime Minister of being too close to wealthy donors with overseas accounts.

He said: 'Let's take Stanley Fink, who gave £3million to the Conservative Party. He actually appointed him as Treasurer of the Tory Party and gave him a peerage for good measure.

'Can he explain what steps he's going to take about the tax avoidance activities of Lord Fink.'

Mr Cameron said: 'When people donate to the Conservative Party they don't pick the candidates, they don't choose the policies and they don't elect the leader.

'When the trade unions donate they pay for the candidates, they pay for the policies and the only reason he is sitting there is because a bunch of trade union leaders decided he was more left-wing than his brother.'

But Mr Miliband said: 'He didn't just take the money. He appointed the man who was head of HSBC as a minister. It was in the public domain September 2010 that HSBC was enabling tax avoidance on an industrial scale – are we seriously expected to believe that when he made Stephen Green a minister four months later he had no idea about these revelations.'

He dismissed the claims as 'fiction' and said he had clamped down on tax avoidance. He said: 'Those two in the Treasury were the friends of the tax dodger. We're the friends of the hard-working taxpayer.'

Mr Miliband responded: 'He's bang to rights, just like his donors.' 

The billionaire paedophile friend of Prince Andrew was among HSBC offshore investors named in the leaked account files.

The data links Jeffrey Epstein to several private accounts in Geneva, including one in his own name which held £2.3million.

Epstein, above right, who was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting sex with underage girls, was last month accused of employing teenage 'sex slave' Virginia Roberts, who claimed he made her sleep with Prince Andrew when she was 17. Buckingham Palace has denied the Duke of York had 'any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts' and Epstein has called her claims 'outlandish and offensive'.

The disgraced hedge fund manager is one of seven clients of HSBC's private banking arm in Geneva known to have donated to the charitable foundation run by former US president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary.

Miss Roberts, now 31 and a mother of three, has said she met Mr Clinton twice but was never 'lent out' to him. She claimed Epstein told her: 'He owes me some favours.'

Epstein gave $25,000 (£16,400) to the foundation in July 2006, the year after he was arrested following a complaint he abused a 14-year-old, the Guardian reported.

Another HSBC Geneva client, restaurateur Richard Caring, transferred $1million to the foundation, seemingly in return for Mr Clinton's attendance at a charity ball in 2005.

It is not illegal to hold a Swiss bank account and there is no evidence any of the donors used accounts to avoid tax. The foundation keeps a public database of donors and says all donations are vetted carefully.

Furious MPs have accused HMRC of 'failing' the public by letting wealthy tax avoiders 'get away with' stashing their cash in Swiss bank accounts.

The Chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge said she was furious at the 'pathetic' response to leaked HSBC files showing thousands of British-based individuals held bank accounts in Switzerland. 

She said the tax authorities had failed to serve British taxpayers' interests in their response to the leak in 2010.

HMRC permanent secretary Lin Homer insisted that HMRC staff had been 'diligent' in their approach to the files

HM Revenue and Customs has only secured one prosecution from a list of 6,800 UK-related accounts provided  by French authorities five years ago.

Ms Hodge said it appeared that activities related to the Geneva branch of HSBC's Swiss subsidiary were 'pretty outrageous' and told HMRC permanent secretary Lin Homer that taxmen should have spoken to whistleblower Herve Falciani, who initially obtained the list while employed as an IT worker in 2007.

Ms Homer insisted that HMRC staff had been 'diligent' in their approach to the files, and said their record of securing one conviction and £135 million in unpaid tax, fines and interest compared well with other countries.

But Ms Hodge told her that the French tax authorities had recouped £200 million from 3,000 names and the Spanish £180 million from 2,900.

And she told the HMRC chief: 'It's pretty outrageous what was going on.

'It's the first time in many of these leaks that there are really strong allegations not of egregious tax avoidance, but of tax evasion, and that is incredibly serious.

'For you to sit there and say, as you are doing, that "We couldn't get the money in in the same way as the French and Spanish did" and "We didn't litigate because we wanted to get the money in" and yet you did worse on the money - it leaves me believing that you are not serving the British taxpayer.'
