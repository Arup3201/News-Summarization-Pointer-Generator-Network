A bigamist was caught by his wife after she saw a photograph of his wedding to a teenager on Facebook.

Nicolette Watkinson called the police after discovering Stephen Smith, 52, married Awa Jobarteh, 19, at the same registry office in Africa where they had wed seven years earlier.

But Smith has avoided a prison sentence after claiming he was duped by Miss Jobarteh – who dumped him two days after they returned to the UK from Gambia and has not been traced since.

Bigamist: Stephen Smith, 52, was caught after this picture of him with his new bride Awa Jobarteh, 19, appeared on Facebook and was seen by his current wife

Suffering: Nicolette Smith leaves Teesside Crown Court and said she was disappointed her estranged husband, Stephen Smith, was not jailed for bigamy

Miss Watkinson, 39, a marketing 
executive, met factory worker Smith in 2001 and they married in 2005. 
The father of two was divorced from his first wife at the time.

Just
 18 months after their wedding, they split up and Miss Watkinson moved 
out of the marital home in Pickering, North Yorkshire.

However,
 Smith failed to keep up with the mortgage repayments and left without 
giving a forwarding address. The house was repossessed and Miss 
Watkinson was saddled with a £160,000 debt, which bankrupted her.

Smith
 had disappeared and her lawyers received no reply in their efforts to 
start divorce proceedings.

Defence: Stephen Smith claimed he was a victim after his young bride fled within two days of arriving in Britain

After hearing that her husband had met a new 
lover in Gambia, Miss Watkinson checked his Facebook page and found the 
wedding photo of him with Miss Jobarteh.

Teesside
 Crown Court was told that Smith, of York, thought he had signed an 
official divorce petition on the day before his wedding to Miss Jobarteh
 in Banjul, the capital of Gambia, in November 2012.

He
 said he had left finalising the divorce papers to his young bride and 
that she returned the documents with a ‘red stamp of authorisation’ on 
them.

But Miss 
Watkinson’s signature on the papers was fake. Robert Mochrie, defending,
 said: ‘This was a man who acted rather hastily. It is, you might think,
 absurd somebody is getting married on the same day they are handed a 
divorce certificate. If he’d waited just a few months perhaps, a divorce
 might well have been finalised.’

Mr
 Mochrie told the court that Smith married Miss Jobarteh out of love, 
adding: ‘This defendant, born in 1961, was perhaps understandably taken 
by her and was keen to tie the knot.

‘People are often paid to become involved in sham marriages but that was not the case.’

He
 added: ‘He has been wronged. He was abandoned by his third wife. Her 
intentions were quite clearly to dupe a man of more senior years, as so 
often happens with men who travel to foreign lands to seek happiness.’

On
 Thursday, Smith was given a six month jail sentence suspended for two 
years and ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work. He admitted bigamy at 
an earlier hearing.

Judge
 Tony Briggs said he had ‘considerable sympathy’ for Miss Watkinson, 
adding: ‘I can well understand her being extremely upset by the thought 
that you’d married again without the courtesy of going through a divorce
 with her.’

But outside the 
court, Miss Watkinson said of Smith: ‘I feel as though he has got away 
with this and has been portrayed as some kind of victim himself after 
all that he has put me through.

‘He knew if he responded to my divorce petition, he’d give away where he’d been hiding.’

Long journey: Smith had married second wife Nicolette in the Gambia after they 'fell in love' with the country only to return in 2012 to marry a teenager behind her back

Wronged: Nicolette was left bankrupt after Smith disappeared and failed to pay the mortgage

Smith is not the first bigamist to fall foul of Facebook.

Former
 policeman Martin Curran, 52, of Burtonwood, Cheshire, lied to his wife 
Lisa when she found Facebook pictures of him marrying his lover. He said
 they were fake but was convicted and given a community order in August 
2012.

Benefits cheat 
Heath Joynson, 45, of Stoke, claimed to be single but got caught last 
August after his wife posted their wedding pictures on the social 
networking site.

And Brian Frain was jailed for three months after his first wife saw him marrying again before they were even divorced.

When
 jailed in September, Frain, 36, of Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, said he 
couldn’t wait to get out of the marriage so he could marry a third time,
 to mother-of-four Donna Darwent, 33.
