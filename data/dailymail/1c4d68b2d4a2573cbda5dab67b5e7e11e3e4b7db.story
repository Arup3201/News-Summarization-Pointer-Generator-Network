Everton are nervously awaiting results of tests that could leave Kevin Mirallas and Leon Osman facing lengthy absences.

Mirallas had tests on Tuesday after he was carried off during Monday’s 3-1 win over Queens Park Rangers with ankle ligament damage.

His right ankle was swollen as a result of a poor challenge from Jordon Mutch, which Roberto Martinez called ‘disappointing’. He is a major doubt for the Christmas fixtures.

Osman’s situation is also causing concern for Martinez, ahead of Saturday’s trip to Southampton. He has not played since coming off the bench against Manchester City on December 6 and has had his ankle in a protective boot.

The former England midfielder was due to see a specialist for further tests and the fear is that he will require an operation.

Martinez’s options in midfield have been hit in recent weeks with James McCarthy recovering from a hamstring problem and Darron Gibson also injured. Gareth Barry, meanwhile, was suspended against QPR having been booked five times.

That meant Martinez had to use Ross Barkley in central midfield alongside Muhamed Besic, having previously said the England international was not ready for the responsibility of that position.

Despite Barkley capping his most complete display of the season with a superb goal, team-mate Steven Naismith has urged caution when considering his progress. 

‘Ross and Mo did fantastically well,’ he said. ‘Ross is a terrific talent with a lot going for him but he has a lot to learn.’
