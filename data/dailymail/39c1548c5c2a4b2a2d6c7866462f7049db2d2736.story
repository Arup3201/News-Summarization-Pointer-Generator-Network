In the weeks after the Boston Marathon bombings, two small planes were used to spy on Khairullozhon Matanov, a friend of the brothers suspected of carrying out the attack.

Residents in Quincy, Massachusetts, reported several sightings of two Cessna-type light aircraft doing loops over their town.

A law enforcement source has now confirmed that the aircraft were part of a surveillance operation focusing on Matanov, who knew Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. 

Under watch: Khairullozhon Matanov, a friend of the Boston bombers, was the focus of a year-long investigation

Surveillance: Light aircraft, similar to this Cessna pictured, were spotted looping over Matanov's hometown of Quincy for a month after the bombings

Matanov was charged last week with obstructing a terror investigation and deleting information from a computer.

The 23-year-old was friends with the Tsarnaev brothers, who are believed to have carried out the attacks, and even dined with them hours hours after the April 15, 2013 bombings.

The FBI had been investigating Matanov since April 19, after the Krygyzstan-born cab driver told police about their friendship.

Quincy councilman Brian Palmucci said soon after, two planes were spotted doing figure-of-eight loops over the town. 

'My phone was ringing off the hook. People were concerned. It started a couple of weeks after the bombing 
and lasted for over a month,' Mr Palmucci told ABC News.

Residents took down the tail numbers, and the police contacted the Federal Aviation Authority after reports of the drone-like aircraft.

But the FAA told Mr Palmucci: 'It's not a drone, we're aware of the flight and it's authorized.'

The
 councilman said that secrecy surrounding the flights had made his 
community - already on edge after the bombings - even more nervous.

'There was no doubt they were looking at
 our neighborhood so folks were very uneasy and they started to question
 whether there was some imminent public danger,' he said.

A source close to the investigation into Matanov confirmed to the Patriot Ledger
 that the aircraft were used as part of a surveillance operation into 
the young man. Investigators kept him under surveillance for about a 
year.

Friend: Cab driver Matanov, pictured, knew the brothers suspected of carrying out the bombings, and took them out for dinner just hours after two devices were detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon

When Matanov appeared in court last week, he entered no plea to the charges against him, and was held in detention. 

He is facing charges of destroying records and making a false statement in a terrorism investigation.

Matanov, who was given U.S. residency because of unrest in his home country, also allegedly met the Tsarnaev brothers and spoke to them in the days after the April 15 attack.

He is not believed to have had prior knowledge of the attacks, and didn't know the brothers were suspects until after police released their pictures on April 18.
