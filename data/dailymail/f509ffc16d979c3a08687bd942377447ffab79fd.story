A host of former internationals were joined by stars of stage and screen as a Rest of the World XI beat England 4-2 in this year's Soccer Aid charity match at Old Trafford.

Jose Mourinho took time out from overseeing Chelsea's summer transfer business to take charge of the Rest 
of the World XI, helping his team of football legends and big-name celebrities snatch two late goals after an impressive comeback from Sam Allardyce's Three Lions.

The West Ham boss had help from Soccer Aid founder and popstar Robbie Williams, plus TV presenter Bradley Walsh, but couldn't guide his team to a memorable turnaround after goals from former Holland midfielder Clarence Seedorf and Westlife's Nicky Byrne put Mourinho's men 2-0 up.

After a goalless first half the
 Dutchman struck first, exchanging passes inside the area before burying
 a powerful shot past DJ Jamie Theakston and into the top corner.

Rest
 of the World doubled their lead shortly afterwards when, after a 
mistake from Theakston, Byrne lifted the ball delightfully into the top 
of an almost unguarded net.

 columnist Jamie Redknapp, who won 17 senior caps for England, helped 
his country mount a late charge when he pulled a goal back with a fine 
low strike past comedian Patrick Kielty with 15 minutes remaining.

And
 the comeback was complete shortly afterwards when actor Martin Compston
 was penalised for a foul on former Sunderland striker Kevin Phillips 
inside the Rest of the World box.

The
 40-year-old made no mistake from 12 yards, rifling the ball into the 
bottom corner to continue his excellent record from the spot.

As
 England were pushing for a late winner, AC Milan boss Seedorf 
went on a weaving run down the hosts' right-side before cutting onto his
 right foot and unleashing an unstoppable strike which flew into the 
back of the net with the help of a deflection off comedian Jack 
Whitehall.

Seedorf
 completed his hat-trick moments later, timing his run into the 
opposition box perfectly to nod a header past Theakston and make it 4-2.

The
 charity game, which first started in 2006, raises money for Unicef. 
Over Â£12million has been raised through ticket sales and donations over 
the last eight years.
