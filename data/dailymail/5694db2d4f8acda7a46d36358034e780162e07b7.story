It was a touching moment that brought tears to the eyes of the passengers waiting to board their flight to Paris.

As a group of World War II veterans queued at the gate at Detroit Metro Airport an airline gate attendant serenaded them with a rendition of the US National Anthem over the loudspeaker.

Anna Mari Barile sang the tribute on Monday after learning the elderly passengers had served in the military and some were on their way to Normandy, France, to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day on June 6.

She began to sing over the PA system for passengers waiting to board Delta flight 98 from Detroit in Michigan to Paris.

There were 12 Second World War veterans on board the flight – with at least one heading to an event at Omaha Beach.

Holidaymaker Alyssa Vermeulen filmed the moment on her mobile phone and uploaded the footage to YouTube.

respect, as Barile, a DTW gate agent and Italian interpreter for Delta, 
sang a rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner.

Vermeulen,
 who was en route to Europe for her honeymoon, said she was touched as 
members of her family had served in the military – including her 
grandfather, who served as a marine in the Second World War.

Patriotic: The passengers were waiting to board their flight at Detroit Metro Airport

‘It was a lovely display of patriotism in such a crazy place,’ she told today.com.

'Usually, airports are a high stress environment where people are rushing to connections, frantically gathering items, or anxiously waiting (for) their zone call to board, but for a few minutes everyone in the airport was standing, quiet and peaceful, showing respect to those who fought for our freedom.’

She told thestir.cafemom.com: ‘The respect continued on the plane - everyone stopped to thank these men for [their] service.

‘The pilot even thanked them all by name and announced to the cabin when they flew over Normandy.

‘One of the veterans also celebrated his 95th birthday on the plane and everyone sang to him before we deplaned,’ she added.

Elizabeth, another interpreter for Delta, told WXYZ.com: ‘Everybody in the boarding area had tears in their eyes.’
