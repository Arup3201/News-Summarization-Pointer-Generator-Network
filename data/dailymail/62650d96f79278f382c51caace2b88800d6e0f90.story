Charged: Dewey Green, who describes himself as a skater and filmmaker, has been charged in the death of 53-year-old Janice Pitts

A 23-year-old skater has been charged with murder after ramming a pregnant grandmother with his car before running her over, police said.

Filmmaker Dewey Green allegedly repeatedly rear-ended Janice Pitts' car on a Douglasville, Georgia highway on Wednesday afternoon and crushed her with his SUV when she got out to inspect the damage.

Pitts' daughter, Iesha Davis, watched in horror as the motorist then backed over her mother, killing her in a random road rage attack.

'I’m banging on the window, ‘Please, 
you're crushing my mom, you're crushing my mom. Please, you're crushing 
my mom',' Davis told WSB-TV.

'He wouldn't look at me. He kept his face straight and kept his 
foot down on the gas. He backed up, my mom's body dropped.'

Davis, whose infant child was also sitting in the car, continued: 'After
 that, I just completely lost it. I don't understand why. I don't 
understand why.

'I'll never ever get the image of my mom 
lifeless body lying on the pavement and the man ran her over like she 
was nothing.'

Pitts,
 a two time cancer survivor, just found out she was expecting a child 
with her partner Tyrone Williams. He paid tribute to her on his Facebook
 page with a series of photos.

'My heart is soooooo f***** heavy at this moment right now..... DAMN!!!!' he wrote.

The victim

Victim: Pregnant Janice Pitts, 53, died on Wednesday after a motorist rammed and ran over her on a Georgia highway

The alleged attacker

Accused: Dewey Green, 23 (pictured left and right), a skater and filmmaker, said he 
was driving from Alabama to Atlanta to visit his girlfriend when the 
incident unfolded Wednesday

Douglasville Police Chief Chris Womack told AL.com that Green rammed Pitts' vehicle on Highway 5 three times for no reason.

When Pitts got out of her vehicle to inspect the damage, Green used his SUV to pin Pitts between her vehicle and his, and then backed over her.

He said Green drove over the median and across a grassy knoll before witnesses stopped him and took his keys.

Pitts was pronounced dead about 2.30pm from massive blunt force trauma.

'It's horrific,' Chief Womack said. 'This lady was going to Lowe's. This could have happened to me, you, anybody.'

He said that investigators are working to establish a motive and whether Green was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Green, who describes himself as a filmmaker, allegedly told police he was driving from Alabama to Atlanta to see his girlfriend.

'Obviously we believe this young man wasn't in the right frame of mind,' Chief Womack said. 

WSB-TV reported that Green's father told police his son had been acting strangely in the days before the incident.

Green, from Alabama, was booked into the Douglas County Jail just before 7pm on Wednesday.

He is charged with murder, aggravated assault and aggravated battery, jail records show. He is being held without bond.

Green describes himself as a 'hippie' and 'skater' on the website for his film Southern Ruckus, which 'showcases the up and coming talent of many young extreme sport athletes doing what they do best'.

Green's friends have reacted with shock to his arrest.

'The only violence I can remember from 
him is when some kids smacked him in the face with a two by four and he
 just came back at them,' Brittany Rosser, who attended Pelham High School with Green, told WIAT.com. 'He was trying to defend one of his 
friends.'

Green was a well-known skater who often went to Faith Skate Supply.

Owner Peter Karvonen said he’s known Green since he was around twelve and noticed there was something different about him when he saw him on Saturday.

'He was acting out of character, a little loopy,' Karvonen told WIAT.com.

AL.com reported that Alabama court records show Green has had several traffic issues in Alabama, including a reckless driving conviction in 2011.
