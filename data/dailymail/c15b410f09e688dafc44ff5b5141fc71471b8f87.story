An 'update' of the scrabble app on social networking site Facebook has left players lost for words.

After Electronic Arts EA took over the running of the online game from Scrabble brand owner Mattel, it decided to revamp its game structure.

Sadly, these changes have not gone down with with seasoned players, with the key bone of contention being that player history has been deleted.

Outrage: The 'updated' version of Facebook app Scrabble has been met with derision by loyal players

This means that the aggregate win percentage of a player who has been gaming for years has been lost to the abyss.

This has led players, not surprisingly, bombarding the Facebook page for the popular game showing their disgust with the new format.

Other changes include the dictionary being changed from Chambers to Collins, and the refresh stalling after a player's turn.

One post put by the page admin, totally unrelated to the 'update' was met with a raft of negative comments.

Andrea Appleyard wrote: 'The scrabble moment when u realise how only pure arrogance can fly in the face of such overwhelming opposition to the new format.. and STILL you just give the lot of us The Finger! Aw well!

Barbara Bishop added: 'I miss playing Scrabble - please admit that you made a serious mistake and bring back the original game.'

Popular opinion: Andrea Appleyard's comment was 'liked' 315 times

Negative: There isn't a positive comment in sight here

And this was echoed by fellow fan Jacqueline Smith who wrote: 'That Scrabble moment when you discover that the game you loved to play had gone only to be replaced by a crap version!!!'

Disgruntled users also have a Facebook group to air their discontent after 'please bring back the scrabble we love' was set up.

This has attracted more than 2,000 members.

Game users have also complained that the new version of the game does not allow them to pick who they play against and have also dismissed the new design as ‘brash’.

Bad move: Unfortunately there isn't many 'likeable' comments on this post

Helen Jones, 54, a support worker from Southport said: ‘I’ve been playing for the past five years. I’d play for around an hour of an evening when I come home from work.

‘I’ve met some really interesting people. Of course they do not substitute friends, but we had a community. I’ve just had a grandchild and a lot of the people I played with knew that and would ask how it was going.

Such is the strong feeling on this, a petition has been set-up called: 'Scrabble - If it ain't broke don't fix it' by John Lewis from Sheffield.

On this petition, he writes: 'In the weeks running up Sunday, 27th May 2013, Mattel promised a new “improved” version of Scrabble.

'In our opinion what was delivered is a great disappointment. Judging 
by the comments left on Scrabble playing message boards, dissatisfaction
is almost universal. There are very few if any of the community of 
players who have messaged anything positive about the changes

'We are now presented with a random playing partner and therefore 
cannot choose against someone who regards themselves as a novice or 
against someone who considers themselves to be a serious player. This is
frustrating.

'We enjoyed having the choice of whether or not play a 2 minute game or a week game. That choice has now been removed.'

Over 5,000 people have signed the petition so far.

A spokesman for Mattel said: ‘The Scrabble Facebook game is now managed by a new partner EA Mobile.

'The benefits of the new game include gameplay across devices, the addition of the Collins Official Scrabble Wordlist, the ability to play in six languages, the option to customise boards and tiles and the option to play ad-free.

‘As part of the transition, we were unable to carry over ongoing games and statistics, the timer mode and the manual match-making function.

'The new version will have the same robust statistics moving forward.’
