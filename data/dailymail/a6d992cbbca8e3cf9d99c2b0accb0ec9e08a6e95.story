She shot to fame as one quarter of girl group Eternal way back in the 1990s and despite turning 40 this year, Louise Redknapp is looking better than ever.

Her career, too, is booming. She recently used her fashion expertise to edit a range for TU at Sainsbury's, she and husband Jamie are the faces of Pandora's Christmas campaign and now she's got a beauty campaign under her belt.

The mother-of-two's latest venture sees her showcasing her eternally youthful looks as the face of Dr Organic Snail Gel range.

Still going strong: Louise Redknapp may have been working in the industry for over 20 years but as her new campaign proves, she's looking better than ever

The campaign couldn't be more fitting for the organic beauty fan, who also runs her own all-natural cosmetics range.

'I have a huge interest in organic and natural skincare,' she told MailOnline. 'I looked into the snail gel range and I liked everything about it, it was perfect for me.'

The WAG and singer explains: 'Unfortunately, anti-ageing is very important for me at this age. That's why I love this range, it's hydrating and so fresh. I wish I'd thought of it!'.

As well as using the range she's promoting, Louise maintains that the only other products she uses are her own from Wild About Beauty - the organic range she established with her make-up artist, Kim Jacob.

'My skincare routine is really simple,' she says. 'I cleanse my face and put moisturiser on, that's it. Less really is more.'

The star has such a passion for fashion (she runs her own blog with her pals called A Style Album), that she takes heed of catwalk trends and incorporates them into her make-up palettes. 

'Our make-up is fashion-led. I look at trends, analyse textures, create mood boards and plan for the year ahead,' she explains.

Her range has even got the royal seal of approval - she sends some of her bestsellers to friend and fellow natural beauty, Princess Beatrice, she revealed.

Like Bea, Louise favours a natural look - and says husband Jamie has 'no option' but to deal with it. She does, however, love getting glammed up for work, and her new Pandora campaign is case in point.

'We had such a good day shooting it, it was so much fun,' she said of the campaign. 'Jamie is my best mate as well as my husband so we had such a laugh - we really do entertain each other.'

Strong couple: Louise and football pundit Jamie married in 1998 and have two young boys together

The couple, who married back in 1998, are one of showbiz's strongest couples and say they'd love to work together again, as long as it was something they believe in.

Twenty years into her career, Louise says she 'feels good getting up and going to work' because she has a 'genuine interest' in what she's doing.

As for rumours of her getting back into the studio, she said: 'I haven't been in yet but we have been talking about it. I think it's all about finding the right thing, every decision is so key.'

In the meantime, her fashion blog is keeping her busy. 'It came out of the blue but it's going so well and takes up so much of my time,' she said. 

'My family scream at me at night because I am sat there on the internet looking at skirts and spending more money,' she laughed.
