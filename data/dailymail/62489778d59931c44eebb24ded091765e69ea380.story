California man hooked the catch of a lifetime while on vacation in Alaska.

The Orange County Register reports Friday 76-year-old Jack McGuire of Santa Ana caught a 482-pound Pacific halibut.

McGuire struggled for 40 minutes before the giant fish was reeled in.

'The moment I set the hook I hollered, ‘I got a big one!’' McGuire told reporters. 'We get in the back of the boat and we get in this battle.'

It took 40 minutes of fighting to pull the fish close to the surface. Captain Rye Phillips was the first on board to spot the monstrous halibut.

'All of a sudden he (Phillips) said, ‘Oh my god. This is a monster,’' McGuire told the OC Register. 'And this is a captain
 who has seen a lot of fish.'

His
 catch outweighs the 459-pound Pacific halibut caught in Alaska in 1996 
that is the world record, but it doesn't meet International Game Fish 
Association regulations.

The halibut was shot, then harpooned before it 
was brought aboard the boat, disqualifying the catch from being 
considered for a world record.

McGuire was on a weeklong fishing trip near Glacier Bay with his three children when he caught the 95-inch-long fish.

He
 says the boat captain shot the giant fish to keep it from flopping 
around and hurting someone.

He applauded the decision, even if it 
contributed to him not getting the record.

'That’s a catch of a lifetime,' he said
