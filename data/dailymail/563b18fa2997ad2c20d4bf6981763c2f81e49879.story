Here is Lindsay Lohan opening up about her latest spell in jail.

Speaking to Jay Leno on the tonight show, the Mean Girls star admits: 'I've made a lot of poor decisions and I'm dealing with the consequences.'

Lindsay made a previously unplanned visit to Leno's Tonight Show to talk about being jailed on, ironically, 'Good Friday'.

'I was kind of shocked, I didn't expect the outcome to be what it was.

'But I'm a big girl and I'm going to do what I'm told to do. I'm taking responsibility,' she said.

Asked if she was treated unfairly, she - perhaps unexpectedly - 
insisted: 'I think that I was treated the way I should have been 
treated.'

And as for jail, she said: 'It was an interesting 
experience and it was definitely a wake up call. But everything happens 
for a reason.'

She added: 'I'm not a kid anymore. I'm 24, I've made a lot of mistakes and I recognise that. 

'I feel like I've let a lot of my fans down by putting myself in situations when I was young and wasn't thinking clearly,' she said.

'I really just want to be the person that I aspire to be, and be the actress, and be in this industry and make movies and do what I love to do, and bring characters to life that people can relate to. And my fans have been really supportive of me doing that.'

In shock: Lilo told Leno she found the sentence 'shocking' and said it her left her 'kind of numb' but said she was treated as she should have been

Leno told her that Jane Fonda, a recent guest on the show and Lohan's
 costar in Georgia Rules, called her one of the best young actresses 
she's worked with.

'That's amazing, coming from her,' Lohan said.

'I'm in the clear now, and as long as I stay focused, I can achieve what I want to achieve.'

Lohan received a standing ovation from the audience after her candid interview.

Lilo, a late addition to the show, bumping 
scheduled guest, Broadway and Glee star Kristin Chenoweth, to another 
date, also told Leno she found the sentence 'shocking' and said it her left her 'kind of numb.'

Leno asked Lohan, 'At what point did you realise, 'Oh my God, I could lose this, this could slip away from me?''

'I
 think that when, you know, being young and being in the position I was 
in, you don’t really take the time to appreciate what you have and it’s 
all kind of a whirlwind, and people make decisions for you,' Lohan said.

Leno also asked about her current support system, considering her 'odd childhood.'

'Interesting,' Lohan corrected him.

'My mom's amazing, she's really strong. My sister's here with me...I have good people in my life,' she insisted.
  
What about dad Michael Lohan? Leno asked. 'Am I supposed to respond? Because I'm not going to. I plead the Fifth on that!'

But in a roundly good-natured interview Leno also asked about Lohan's seemingly dormant love life.

'You always bring the love life question up!'she protested.

'I don't have one right now...I used to not like to be alone, but I really value my alone time now. That happens as you grow up, you cherish the time when you can just sit by yourself...I've learned to love myself.'

And the optimistic starlet remains positive she can turn her life around. When Leno asked where she sees herself when she turns 30 -- six years from now.

She replied: 'Hopefully, sitting here after winning an Oscar.'

According to Radaronline.com, Lohan will be serving her 360-hour court-ordered community service at the Downtown Women's Center in Los Angeles.

The group's CEO, Lisa Watson said: 'The DWC is a life changing 
experience for all who walk through our doors. DWC hopes that Miss Lohan
 is inspired by her experience here.'

The 24-year-old also talked about playing the wife of John Gotti Jr. in the crime family movie, Gotti: Three Generations.

The Gotti film's production company, Fiore Films, has stood by its 
decision to hire Lindsay, 24, who has been cast to play Kim Gotti, the 
daughter-in-law of The Teflon Don the late John Gotti.

'She has been cast in this role. She still has the role and we're very excited about her being in the movie,' he said.

Honig refused to discuss how long the movie producers were willing to wait for Lindsay to sort her legal woes.

'We're not going to speculate on "What if this happens, what if that happens",' he said.

'We're dealing with a few unknowns. Once we start understanding exactly what the situation is, that's when we can start making some decisions.'

The film is meant to begin filming in September or October in New York and also stars John Travolta and Joe Pesci.

The actress is currently on bail after spending five hours in the Lynwood Correctional Facility on Friday following the preliminary hearing into her alleged theft of a $2,500 necklace.

Lohan will be appealing the sentence, although legal experts say it is unlikely she will win it.

Producer Nathan Folks, a friend of Lindsay's, told People.com that she is 'upset' over the 120 days jail she has been sentenced to.

'She is angry because she has been working so hard on turning her life around,' Folks said, insisting Lohan is clean and sober.

A Los Angeles judge sentenced Lindsay to 120 days for violating her 
probation by taking a designer necklace, a charge the judge reduced from
 felony grand theft to a misdemeanour.

The actress's lawyers appealed the jail sentence, Lindsay's fourth, and she was freed on bond after a few hours behind bars.

Lohan had another brush with the law today - after being slapped with a parking ticket.

The actress was given a $64 fine after leaving her car parked outside her house in Venice, California, during street cleaning hours.
