Times Square subway station was locked down for just over an hour Monday afternoon for a false alarm.

Initially reported to be a hand grenade, the device that stopped the city’s busiest subway station in its tracks for about an hour Monday turned out to be a Chinese lantern, officials said.

The station was evacuated just after 1:36pm Monday, and multiple train lines bypassed as the investigation ran its course.

The busiest in the city: Times Square subway station has 11 lines and served over 62million strap hangers last year

Found on a northbound track on the 8th Avenue A, C, E train lines, the New York Police Department initially declined to confirm if the device was a grenade.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority confirmed reports of a grenade were being investigated, but a spokesperson also added that ‘we get reports of crazy things all the time.’

The 7 train, which ends at Times Square, mysteriously had delays ‘due to signal problems’ during the investigation – they curiously cleared up as soon as the all clear was given.

The station reopened just before 2:30pm.

Mistaken for a grenade: A Chinese lantern, similar to these, was mistaken for a grenade and resulted in the station being closed for an hour

An NYPD spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline that the device was a Chinese lantern. There was no word on how it got there. The device was first reported to be a lantern by NBC New York

A previous terror plot at the station was foiled in 2009 when Najibullah Zazi was arrested before being able to carry out a plan that officials said would have seen multiple suicide bombers during rush hour on trains in the station.

The busiest station in the City, Times Square has 11 subway lines and served over 62million passengers in 2012, according to the MTA.
