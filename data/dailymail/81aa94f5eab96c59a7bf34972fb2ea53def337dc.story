Other Australian states and territories may follow Queensland's tough-cop lead in dealing with problem motorcycle gangs, after its controversial anti-bikie laws were upheld in the High Court on Friday.

The High Court has rejected a challenge, brought by Hell's Angels member Stefan Kuczborski, to the new Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment (VLAD) laws introduced by the Queensland government in October last year.  

The VLAD laws, brought in following a public bikie brawl in a Gold Coast restaurant last year, declared 26 gangs criminal organisations and banned their members from wearing club logos and gathering in public.

The Australian High Court has rejected a challenge to Queensland's tough anti-bikie laws which ban outlaw motorcycle clubs from wearing club patches and gathering in public spaces

The United Motorcycle Council (UMC), on behalf of 17 Queensland clubs, had funded the High Court challenge in an attempt to overturn the laws, which it claims are unconstitutional.  

But the High Court found the laws are not unconstitutional and said Mr Kuczborski lacked standing to pursue the challenge because he had never been charged under the legislation.

In doing so, it has opened the way for other states to look at hardening their approach to outlaw  gangs.

'We'd be crazy not to take advantage of that and make some modifications to our laws,' said South Australian Attorney-General John Rau, who wants to see  the power to declare criminal organisations in the hands of the parliament as it is in Queensland.

Attorney-General of Western Australia, Michael Mischin, said Friday's ruling was encouraging.

'I shall read the judgement with interest to determine what lessons can be learnt and how the effectiveness of ours may be improved,' he said.

Northern Territory Attorney-General John Elferink said his government was also attracted to a number of elements in the Queensland laws. 

Similar laws banning convicted criminals and criminal organisations from meeting in NSW are already in place.

Following the High Court ruling, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman told reporters in Brisbane: 'It would be good to see everyone work together to make Australia a far safer place.'

United Motorcycle Council spokesman Mick Kosenko said he was disappointed the judges focused on whether Mr Kuczborski was entitled to challenge the laws. 

'The laws still haven't been made valid by the High Court,' he told reporters.
