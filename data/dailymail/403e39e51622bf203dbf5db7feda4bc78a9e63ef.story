Louise Roe has revealed that she is to succeed Elle Macpherson as the host of NBC series Fashion Star.

The British television presenter, 30, told MailOnline that she was honoured to have landed the role, and can't wait to start filming.

'This is such an exciting job for me - I'm beyond thrilled!' she said. 

New host: Louise Roe, pictured last week at the DKNY show in shoes and a bag of her own design, is to replace Elle Macpherson on NBC's Fashion Star

The second season of the show will see Nicole
Richie, Jessica Simpson and designer John Varvatos are stay on as 
mentors.

Australian supermodel Elle, 49, will remain on board as executive producer, 
but hand over the central presenting role.

'The show 
incorporates all the elements of the fashion industry that I love and 
thrive off,' Louise continued.

Out of the limelight: Elle Macpherson, pictured in January, will remain on board as executive producer

'TV, brand new design, emerging talent, social media, having
style icons right there to mentor each contestant, and a totally new 
way of marketing and creating new product to buy... on the spot.'

In an official statement, she added: 'As
a host I love working with a live audience, but I'm also looking to use
my experience as a journalist and designer, to very much empathize with
the buyers and contestants.'

Fashion Star, which made its debut in
March this year, sees aspiring designers compete each week to sell their
collections to Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue and H&M.

Contestants that fail to sell their designs to the retailers are up for 
elimination, unless they are saved by a celebrity judge.

The week's winning collections are then timed to go on sale at Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue and H&M after each episode airs, so fans can instantly get the looks they saw on TV.

Though Fashion Star generated just under 5million viewers per episode in its first season, the concept is a profitable one for both NBC and the retailers.

Both parties share in the profits from the sale of each collection, and some items proved so popular, they sold out within hours.

Louise, who is fashion editor-at-large for U.S. Glamour magazine, presents MTV makeover show Plain Jane, is a regular on E! and was a guest judge on Britain's Next Top Model.

Celebrity panel: Jessica Simpson, John Varvatos and Nicole Richie are mentors and judges on Fashion Star, and will return for season two

She is certainly qualified for the role,
with two fashion lines of her own: a clothing collection with HSN in 
the U.S., and a shoe and accessories line for StylistPick in the UK.

Today, the New York Post speculated about the appointment, reporting that Bravo boss Andy Cohen had been in the running for the Fashion Star job.

Apparently producers were forced to consider other alternatives after his busy schedule saw him back out.
