A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man in his 80s died at a care home.

Police were called to Sowerby House care home in Thirsk, North Yorkshire yesterday afternoon after the man was found dead in his room.

The woman, of Thirsk, was arrested late yesterday evening on suspicion of murder and is currently in police custody for questioning.

Police believe she was an 'associate' of the resident, not an employee at the care home, but detectives say they are looking into their relationship.

Officers were called to the privately-owned care home at around 3.20pm yesterday after the pensioner was found dead in his room.

The Edwardian property, which has a modern side extension, stands in the tree-lined Front Street in the attractive village of Sowerby on the outskirts of Thirsk. 

A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'Following an early investigation and forensic assessment, it is suspected that the injuries suffered by the deceased are non-accidental.

'As a result, a woman in her 50s from Thirsk, who has no known connection to the care home, was arrested late on Wednesday evening on suspicion of murder.

'She is currently in police custody for questioning.'

The care home has yet to comment on the incident.

Senior investigating officer Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn said: 'We ask that consideration is given to the residents and the families connected to the care home at this time.

'The home has not been closed; however, there are areas within the home which are still being examined.

'Specially trained police family liaison officers have been deployed to support the deceased's family. At this moment we are not in a position to release the identity of the deceased.'
