Manchester United are on the trail of highly-prized Ajax teenager Juan Familia-Castillo.

The exciting 14-year-old played for Holland Under 15s against Belgium Under 15s in two internationals this week and United were represented at both games.

Familia-Castillo is a skilful, left-footed forward whose deft touches have already made him a hit on the internet in Holland.

The youngster was the outstanding performer in Tuesday's 2-2 draw then came on as a second half substitute to help turn the game in Thursday's 3-1 win over their Belgian counterparts.

United, who raided Ajax for 16-year-old defender Timothy Fosu Mensah in August, are keen to bolster their academy ranks as well as their first team as Louis van Gaal looks to develop greater strength in depth to their squads.

Meanwhile, former Manchester United assistant Rene Meulensteen has taken a role as consultant with MLS side Philadelphia Union.
