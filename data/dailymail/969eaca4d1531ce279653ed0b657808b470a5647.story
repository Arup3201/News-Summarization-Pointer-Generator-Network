Birmingham frequently gets a bad reputation for its appearance, often being voted the ugliest city in the UK.

However one photographer has sought to change that image by taking dazzling pictures of the city of more than a million people.

Verity Milligan, originally from Northamptonshire, has taken her camera to explore beauty in the sprawling West Midlands metropolis.

'It has changed my perspective on the city by exploring it from different angles and now I think it's very beautiful,' said the 31-year-old.

The photographs show the city and landscape of Brum in dramatic form, the infamous Selfridges building is seen shimmering as the sun rises over the city.

The legendary canal network, famously more extensive than Venice's, is seen appealingly bathed in soft light.

Ms Milligan, who teaches video production, often gets up early in the mornings to get the best pictures.

'The city is really quiet at sunrise, you don't see it when it's not busy with people running around.'

The photographer said: 'There might be prettier cities, but I think there are parts of Birmingham that are absolutely beautiful, and worth exploring'

When asked what she had to say to people who criticise Birmingham, she said: 'If you explore any city and give it your time, it can change your perspective.

'There might be prettier cities, but I think there are parts of Birmingham that are absolutely beautiful, and worth exploring.'

Birmingham has not only been voted the ugliest city, but the famed Bullring Selfridges building had been voted the ugliest building in the UK.

Even the author Jane Austen had it in for Brum. A line from her book, Emma reads: 'One has no great hopes of Birmingham. I always say there is something direful in the sound.'

More recently it was even voted the most boring and least romantic city in Europe.

But as Verity's pictures show, you may have to dig a little deeper to unearth Birmingham's splendour.
