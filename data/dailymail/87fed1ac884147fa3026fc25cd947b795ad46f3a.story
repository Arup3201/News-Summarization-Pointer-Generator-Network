He was forced to drink vinegar until he feared he would throw up blood, and made others swim in pools of vomit and excrement, but now, a reformed frat boy is exposing the sordid and sometimes deadly truths behind life in a college fraternity.

Andrew Lohse, a 24-year-old Dartmouth College student, made himself a pariah in 2012 when he wrote a blog post exposing the hazing rituals at his Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and is now calling for an overhaul of the system.

In a new book, 'Confessions of an Ivy League Frat Boy', he has opened up on the vile goings-on which are kept secret by fraternities and are so extreme that they have promising young students dead.

Confessions of a frat boy: Andrew Lohse is revealing all about the sordid nature of hazing in a new book

The book details his experiences at the $60,000-a-year school, where he is still a student, but is on indefinite 'medical leave' because of what people might do to him for his blog exposé.

He tells of how boys are forced to down beer until they throw up on each other's heads and swim in bodily fluids, while saying it is time these exclusive colleges moved on.

'Hazing was always part of the system for rank-and-file frat boys. It’s privilege and entitlement - this whole "Lord of the Flies" thing,' he told the New York Post.

'But they didn’t come in as bad kids - they weren’t just released from Rikers Island - they’re fundamentally brilliant, hardworking, talented kids.'

Mr Lohse wants rid of the traditional Greek system, and believes women should be allowed in to remove gender segregation.

'The people who defend the status quo are on the wrong side of history,' he said. 'The only way is to abolish the structure as we know it, or modernise it to the 21st century [by making] it coed. Part of the problem with frats is that we’re not in a gender-segregated world any more.

'The school owes it to its students to abolish the system and re-purpose it. Imagine if you could put these gorgeous houses and real estate to a good use, instead of being the place where people vomit on each other.'

Mr Lohse's 2012 blog told how he was 'forced to chug cups of vinegar until I was afraid that I would vomit blood,' and eat omelettes made from sick.

He admits that he also went on to make others do similar, but has since realised he was wrong.

His fate was far better than that of many others who have been involved with fraternities. In December last year, 19-year-old CUNY Baruch freshman Michael Deng died from brain trauma, and in February 2011 another 19-year-old - Cornell pre-med student George Desdunes - died from alcohol poisoning. 

As well as on their activities, Mr Lohse believe there should be far tougher controls on fraternity budgets, after revealing the crazy sums of money spent on booze at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. 

'We would routinely drop $30,000 per quarter on alcohol alone,' he said, also remembering how they had paid $40,000 for  rapper Maino to play a three-song set at a party in 2009.

'The alumni’s love of the status quo and the college’s lack of moral courage make it a laughing stock,' he said, 'but they need to make the change.

'Yes, they’ll lose donations from these rich, white guys, but the stakeholders in 30 or 40 years will have a different point of view.

'Women won’t write a big fat check for this reckless behaviour to continue in these basements.'

Dartmouth pursued charges against Mr Lohse for hazing after his 2012 blog post, though was cleared along with 26 other frat brothers.

The incident also saw him lose most of his friends, and he was ostracised from Sigma Alpha Epsilon's community, as he he viewed to have brought shame on them.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national leadership announced in March that it was eradicating pledging - the process of initiation into a fraternity, all together.  

Pledging is the process by which someone is initiated into a fraternity, and can take as long as a year and a half to complete. Those who are pledging a frat are known as 'pledges'.

As well as becoming familiar with the fraternity, getting to know everyone and what is stands for, students are expected to prove themselves worthy of being made a 'brother'.

This may be through things an innocent as cleaning the frat house and other such jobs, but can also be far more extreme activities like the one Andrew Lohse describes.

This darker side of initiation is known as hazing, and can often involve alcohol, drugs and sex.

Pledges can be deprived of sleep, beaten, branded, forced to drink huge amounts of alcohol and perform sexual acts.

Every national fraternity and every U.S. university bans hazing, but that does not mean it does not still go on behind the scenes at frats all over the country.
