Carl Froch says he is far better prepared than last time for his blockbuster rematch against George Groves at Wembley on May 31.

With just two weeks to go until the super middleweight bout for Froch's WBA and IBF world titles in London, The Cobra took time out of his punishing training regime to share his thoughts.

And confidence in the Froch camp looks to be high, with the 36-year-old predicting that the fight will not last 12 rounds.

Big bout: Carl Froch is in the midst of his punishing training regime ahead of the George Groves rematch

Froch said: 'I'm feeling very fit, strong and very confident ahead of the 31st.

'I have been so meticulous in the build-up. It just shows the difference between the first fight and the second fight.

'I
 am always physically in great shape, I always train hard and dig in but
 the feeling I am getting now, fitness wise and mentally, it's just 
chalk and cheese from the first fight.

'I
 don't think the fight will go the full 12 rounds. The pace and the 
intensity I'm going to set from round one, I'm convinced George Groves 
hasn't got 12 championship rounds in him. He's not experienced.'

Froch
 admits that anger got the better of him with Groves getting under his 
skin ahead of their bout in Manchester last November.

He said: 'In the build-up, George Groves was very disrespectful, in the fact he was talking to a world champion.

'He said a lot of things that irritated me, annoyed me and got under my skin.

'When I boxed, my game plan went out of the window first time. I didn't even 
box, I was fighting, I was trying to hit him hard from round one which 
is always very bad.

'It's called boxing for a reason, it's not called fighting.'

Froch
 also agrees that there is unfinished business after he beat Groves last
 year with a controversial ninth-round stoppage by referee Howard 
Foster.

Froch
 said: 'The controversy that surrounds the stoppage in the first fight 
and the feedback we got from the general public as well as the boxing 
fans, there is definitely unfinished business.

'It wasn't a natural conclusion, the referee jumped in.'
