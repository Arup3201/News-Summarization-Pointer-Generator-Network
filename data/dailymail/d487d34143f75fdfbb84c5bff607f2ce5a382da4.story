Step into the eerie world of underground living, where residents have built their very own homes and businesses into the chalky clay rocks in the Australian outback.

The mining town of Coober Pedy in South Australia's far north, comes complete with churches, museums, art galleries, a bar and even hotels for travellers to get the underground life first-hand.

Underneath the  moon-like landscape, 3500 residents are living in dugouts or mud caves, with all amenities of a home above ground, including walk-in closets, modern kitchens and televisions.

The culturally diverse town is known for supplying the world with the majority of gem quality opal, which is their main source of income. 

Living in one of the world's most inhospitable regions, the stony desert has climbed to extreme temperatures of up to 50 degrees in the day and dropping to zero at night.

The town water supply comes from an underground source 24 kilometres north of the town, situated 840 kilometres north of Adelaide. 

Around 150 million years ago, Coober Pedy was once an ocean but after the water receded, the sandy silica minerals from the seabed flowed into the rocky cracks and solidified over time, which turned into multi-coloured gem stone opals.

The mining town is home to the world's hottest golf course but to make up the arid conditions, players carry their own patch of artificial grass to minimise damage to their clubs on the parched, stony ground. 

In 1915, miners began to living underground, commonly known as dugouts, to escape the heat of summer and winter's cool desert nights. 

Another attraction to the town includes the annual events of the Coober Pedy OZ Mineral Races, Queen of the Desert Festival and the Opal Festival. 

Every year, residents come together to celebrate the end of summer with raffles, parades and outdoor activities for all ages.  

Coober Pedy has attracted many film-makers and appeared in movies including 'Fire in the stone', 'Pitch black', 'Red Planet' as well as an episode appearance in reality TV series 'Amazing Race'.
