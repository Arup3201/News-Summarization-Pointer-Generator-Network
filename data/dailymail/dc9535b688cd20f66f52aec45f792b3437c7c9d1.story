Roger Federer made light work of Milos Raonic in his opening match of the ATP World Tour Finals in London with a straight sets victory (6-1, 7-6) over the Canadian.

The world No 2, who lost his long-standing unbeaten record against Raonic in a 7-6, 7-5 defeat at last month's Paris Masters, produced a near faultless display in the first set as he cruised into a one-set lead.

The Swiss broke Raonic on two occasions during the opening set, with the 23-year-old unable to deal with anything the seven-times Wimbledon champion put before him.

Raonic was unable to use his big serve to his advantage, with the 33-year-old returning every one of the serves the Croatian hit at him, as Federer easily won the first set 6-1.

The second set was a lot more competitive to say the least, with Federer forced into saving two break points in his second service game, but he showed his class as he pegged back Raonic, before making it 2-2 with a sumptuous ace. 

And in his next service game he was put under pressure from Raonic again, but unsurprisingly the Swiss recovered well to win the game and make it 3-3.

After just two forehand winners from Raonic in the entirety of the first set, the 23-year-old already had seven by the end of his five service games in the second set, proving more than a match for the experienced Swiss. 

The second set eventually went to a tie-break after no slip-ups from either player on the serve, but not before Raonic had a set point on Federer's service, with the imperious veteran hitting a brilliant first serve to yet again deny the Canadian.

Federer started the tie-break confidently, breezing into a 3-0 lead after forcing Raonic into two unforced errors.

And Raonic was unable to pull back that lead, as a double fault, as well as another unforced error, ensured Federer won the tie-break in devastating fashion (7-0), as he leapt ahead of Andy Murray and to the top of  Group B with the win.
