A teenager is facing life behind bars after she was charged with aggravated murder in connection with the death of her foster mother.

Sabrina Zunich, 19, was arrested following the murder of Lisa Knoefel in November 2012.

Last month a Lake County jury convicted her foster father Kevin Knoefel of conspiring to kill his wife.

The 43-year-old, of Ohio, was accused of having a sexual relationship with his foster daughter and showing her how to stab his wife.

Prosecutors told jurors that Kevin Knoefel wanted his wife out of the picture but was afraid he'd lose custody of their three-year-old daughter if they divorced.

Knoefel was convicted of six counts of sexual battery against Zunich, three counts of complicity to aggravated murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder.

Knoefel, who reportedly planned to appeal, could face 25 years to life in prison.

During the trial, Zunich said she had fallen in love 
with her foster father and feared he would commit suicide if she didn't 
carry out their plot to kill his wife. She said it was he who devised the plan to murder his wife.

Zunich testified that she put on a ski mask and fatally stabbed 41-year-old Lisa Knoefel in her bed as she fought back in November 2012, when she was 17.

Prosecutors said Zunich stabbed and cut her more than 150 times with a 10-inch serrated knife.

Kevin Knoefel is led out of Lake County Common Pleas Court on June 11, 2014, after a jury found him guilty of all 11 charges including conspiracy to commit aggravated murder

She
 said they were carrying on a sexual relationship and discussed several 
plans to kill Lisa Knoefel, including shooting her and making it look 
like a burglary, or finding a hit man.

Zunich has now been indicted in the murder of her foster mother, Fox8 has reported. She is expected to be in court next week.

She could face 23 years to life in prison if convicted of aggravated murder.
