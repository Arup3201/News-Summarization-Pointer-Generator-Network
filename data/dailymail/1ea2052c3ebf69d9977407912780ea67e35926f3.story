The doctor behind the controversial procedure which lightened reality TV star Tameka 'Tiny' Harris's eye color has described the procedure as 'completely safe.'  

Dr. Menif Montasser  performed the surgery on the reality star at a clinic in Tunisia, Africa and said it was done under a local anesthetic with no 'pain or redness.'

He told Jezebel: 'This surgery is done under local or general anesthesia with three incisions, one is 2 millimeters and the other two are 0.8 millimeters in the eye's peripheral.'

Happy with the results: 'I looked in the mirror and I was, like, 'they're amazing,' the 39-year-old said

Transformation: Tameka 'Tiny' Harris, wife of rapper T.I., appeared on Good Morning America on Thursday to discuss the cosmetic eye implant she received in Africa to change her eye colour from brown to ice grey

'The implant is folded in to an injector, then it's injected in the eye after filling the eye with viscoelastic.'

He described how this type of procedure only takes about five to ten minutes per eye, and can allow a patient to be out of the operating room and back at the hotel in four hours.

Montasser said: 'The next day she [Tiny] woke up with new ice grey eyes and no pain or redness.'

'She enjoyed her time in Tunisia for the rest of week.'

Montasser said the surgery, which is illegal in America, is perfectly safe but patients must follow strict instructions during the two to three month recovery period.

This type of cosmetic implant  first surfaced about five years ago and has been done in the Middle East, Panama and Africa.  

The implants are permanent unless a patient really needs them out, in which case a doctor can remove the implants with the same incision of 2 millimeters.

Montasser explained: 'The implant was created by doctors and biomedical engineers of BrightOcular but the original artificial iris implant invention goes back from over two decades ago.'

'It's solely used for aniridia cases, which are currently used in the U.S. Europe, and Asia.'

However, the wife of rapper T.I., was forced to defend her decision to permanently lighten the colour of her eyes after she received a backlash from fans on social media sites like Twitter and Instagram.

Harris, who co-wrote TLC's massive hit No Scrubs, said she went to Africa for her procedure and felt  fine afterwards. 

'I looked in the mirror and I was, like, 'they're amazing,' she said on Good Morning America on Thursday.

She added: 'They told me that the procedure was going to be quick, five to 10 minutes an eye. They woke me up. It was very blurry, then it kind of fades in.'  

She later took to Instagram on Monday to show off her new eye colour accompanied by a gushing caption. 

'Huge thanks to the incredible doctor(s) for the amazing experience and for making my dream come true! I hated wearing contacts just for the color and it made my vision blurry!'  Harris wrote. 

'Blessed to say my vision is #perfect after my #ice-gray implants! Special thanks to the #Brightocular staff for ALL that you've done to make this process happen, you're amaZing & thank you to the hospital's staff for your exceptional customer service as well‼️'

She added: 'Of course any procedure has potential risks but no one has gone blind with brightocular and the success rate has been close to 100%.'
