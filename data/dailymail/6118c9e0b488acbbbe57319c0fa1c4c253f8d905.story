Loss of life: The body of 5-year-old Janaya Thompson was found Thursday morning in an abandoned mobile home less than half a mile from her parent's apartment, 12 hours after she disappeared

Police in Gulfport, Mississippi have called off the search for a missing 5-year-old girl after finding her body in an abandoned mobile home this morning.

Little Janaya Thompson was first reported missing Wednesday night, and was last seen around 8:30pm in a parking lot just outside her family's apartment on Klein Road.

She was found 12 hours later in a vacant trailer home less than half a mile from the apartment complex.

Police have released few details on Janaya's case, but say foul play is suspected.

The girl's father Jarmal Thompson told the Sun Herald that he believes a man who volunteered to search for his daughter is involved in the death.

Mr Thompson says the volunteer drove himself and other family members around in a car during the search, but kept disappearing. He claims authorities found a barrette in the volunteer's car that belonged to his daughter.

'They showed it to me but I didn't want to tamper with evidence,' Mr Thompson said.Â 

Family gathered and grieved outside of the mobile home Wednesday afternoon, when Janaya's body was moved.

Janaya's mother has since been taken to the hospital.

'One of us has to be strong,' Mr Thompsons said.

Janaya's aunt Greta Hinton described her neice as a sweet and talkative girl who was looking forward to starting kindergarten in the fall.

She live with her mother, father, grandmother and other relatives.
