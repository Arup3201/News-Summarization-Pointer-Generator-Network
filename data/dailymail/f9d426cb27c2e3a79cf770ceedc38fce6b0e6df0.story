A woman facing criminal charges after her young son died in her filthy home has died before being sentenced.

The woman and her husband, who cannot be identified, were scheduled to appear before the Victorian County Court on Wednesday for a plea hearing over the five-year-old's death.

The boy died after cutting his foot on an empty tin of cat food left lying among masses of rubbish inside the house in 2012.

The house the five-year-old boy died in was described in court documents as being in 'a state of extreme squalor'

The woman and her husband, who cannot be identified, were scheduled to appear before the Victorian County Court on Wednesday over the horrific conditions in their home

The couple were facing two charges of reckless conduct endangering injury, as well as one charge of failing to register the birth of their decreased son

The couple married in the late 1990s and had two boys. 

Victoria Police confirmed that a 41-year-old woman due to face court over the death of a child died in the Royal Melbourne Hospital on October 16.

The boy's father has pleaded guilty to two charges of reckless conduct endangering injury, as well as failing to register the birth of their decreased son. The mother had also pleaded guilty to the same charges. 

When asked to outline her profession, the mother had described herself as a 'deadbeat.' 

The case had been postponed in July after she collapsed in court while giving evidence. She was taken to hospital and a psychiatric report was taken.

 A post-mortem could not identify the cause of the boy's death, but it found he had sustained a 3cm cut to his foot from a tin that nearly severed his toe.

The house was described in court documents as being in a state of extreme squalor, littered with rotting and spoilt food, mould, faeces, broken furniture and household items as well as soiled bedding and clothing. 

The documents also found he was placed in danger of bacterial infection by the faeces in the house and physical danger by the open tins of food littering the floor.

The boy's father is due to appear in court again next month.
