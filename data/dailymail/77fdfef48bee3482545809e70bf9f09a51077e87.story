Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie has quizzed defence force top brass over the threat Ebola-infected suicide terrorists could pose to Australia and its military.

At a Senate Estimates hearing this morning, the controversial Tasmanian senator asked Vice Chief of the Defence Force  Ray Griggs if the nation's enemies could launch an attack with the deadly virus.

Officials replied by saying there was no evidence we could come under attack from the hypothetical scourge.

'I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that is a likely course of action': Senator Jacqui Lambie (left) and Australian Defence Force Vice Chief Ray Griggs faced off at a senate estimates committee hearing on Wednesday morning

The Ebola virus: The deadly ailment has killed 4500 people in West Africa, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures

Ms Lambie asked a series of questions about the ADF's readiness for Ebola at a Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee hearing on Wednesday morning

Not at risk: Vice Admiral Ray Griggs said it would be 'quite difficult' for a person to enter the country without showing Ebola symptoms, particularly given the nation's geographical isolation

Ms Lambie asked: 'Do you have any information to suggest that Australia's enemies could attack our country or military using the virus?' 

'For example with suicide agents who are infected by the disease or who have access to bodily fluids containing the disease.' 

Ms Lambie, a former Army soldier, then pressed Vice-Admiral Griggs on whether the Defence Force had a contingency plan for the scenario.

But Vice Admiral Griggs said there was no proof militants were capable of attacking Australia or its troops with Ebola. 

'I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that is a likely course of action,' he told the hearing.

He said because of Australia's isolation, it would be 'quite difficult' for a person to enter the country without showing symptoms.  

LAMBIE: I was just wondering if I could ask a supplementary on Ebola, if that's OK. Thanks Mr Chair.

Do you have any information to suggest Australia's enemies could use attack our country or military using the virus?

For example with suicide agents who are infected by the disease or who have access to bodily fluids containing the disease. And what is your contingency plan to fight this?

GRIGGS: Well, I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that is a likely course of action. 

One of the things, Senator, that we have playing to our advantage is our geographic (sic) isolation. And that the length of time that it takes simply to get to Australia. 

And (with) the life cycle of the virus, it becomes very obvious relatively quickly how sick someone is. 

So I think the ability to inject someone into the country who is not showing symptoms would be quite difficult.

LAMBIE: I'm just asking if you have a contingency plan. Because if you listen to one side of it, they can say this can take off 10,000 a week, it can hit people by 10,000 a week.

I just want to know... Is there a contingency plan through the Defence Force to tackle the Ebola issue. Are your men and women protected?

GRIGGS: Senator, our men and women are protected as anyone else in the country is. 

The response to that hypothetical situation would be the response to any outbreak of Ebola in Australia. 

Our health system has its preparations ready for the virus appearing in the country.

LAMBIE: And so are the civilian doctors and civilian nurses that... I'm not sure the ratio between defence and civilian now within that medical corps... Are they prepared to fight the Ebola alongside the military? 

I'm not sure what their contracts are. So are they prepared - do they get to move out if they do not want to fight this if it hits? How big is the corps, the medical corps, within the armed forces, which is military? 

GRIGGS: I'll have to take the exact numbers on notice please.

LAMBIE: Thank you.  

In recent months, Ms Lambie, elected to a six-year term in the Senate last year, has waded into a number of controversial issues including the debate surrounding the burqa and Australia's preparedness for the Ebola virus

Last week, Ms Lambie told Daily Mail Australia the 'If you don't love it, leave' slogan on this controversial singlet sold at Woolworths did not go far enough

'Senator, our men and women are as protected as anyone else in the country is,' Vice Admiral Griggs said. 

Ebola has been a pet topic for Ms Lambie in recent weeks.

Last Friday, Ms Lambie proposed the government set up 'M.A.S.H. style' mobile field hospitals to fight Ebola as part of a virus-fighting 'action plan'.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), around 10,000 people could die of the virus each week if it is not brought under control. 

More than 4500 people have died in the three worst hit West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, WHO figures said.  

While there have been a number of scares at Australian hospitals in recent months - including the case of volunteer Red Cross nurse Sue Ellen Kovack - no Australian has reported an infection.
