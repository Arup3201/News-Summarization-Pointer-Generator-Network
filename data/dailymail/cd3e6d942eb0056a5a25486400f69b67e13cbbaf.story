Nintendo's Brain Training and Brain Age games sold 19 million units and became one of the biggest hits on DS - but their supposed health benefits have always been disputed.

Now a study of elderly volunteers has found that Brain Age seems to speed up brain function - when compared to a control group who played Tetris five days a week for a month.

Nintendo's Brain Age games sold 19 million units on the basis of health claims - new research hints that they DO speed up your brain, but not all of its functions

The thirty two volunteers were recruited via advertisements in local newspapers in Japan.

They were split into two groups, one of which played Tetris for 15 minutes a day, five days a week for four weeks.

The other group played Brain Age for the same period.

Measures of cognitive functions were taken before and after the training.

There was a slight increase in speed and certain cognitive functions in the group that had played brain age - although there was no increase in important brain functions such as attention span.

It's also uncertain, say the researchers, whether the games have any long-term effect - and they admit they need to repeat the results with a larger group.

'This result indicated that there is a possibility which the elderly could improve executive functions and processing speed in short term training,' says the paper, published in the journal PLoS One. 'The results need replication in large samples. Long-term effects and relevance for every-day functioning remain uncertain as yet.'

The disclaimer for the article says that Dr Ryuta Kawashima - the neuroscientist who created the games - was involved in the research, but that none of the other scientists at Tohoku University had competing interests.

The publication in a reputable scientific journal also hints that the research is credible,.
