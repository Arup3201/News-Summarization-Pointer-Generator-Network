She thought she would have been spending tonight in his arms.

But after a judge denied 'Manhattan Madam' Anna Gristina bail for the third time today, the only thing she could do was mouth the words 'I love you' to her husband Kelvin Gorr as she was led away in handcuffs.

Instead of being with her family, the 44-year-old will spend tonight behind bars again after a judge told her she is still considered a 'flight risk'.

Dressed all in black, her toyboy husband showed up in court to support his wife and was sitting in the public gallery as the judge denied her bail again.

Plain Jane: Her husband Kelvin Gorr took her new clothes to wear for her third court appearance but even in the black and white dress she looked far from the multimillion-dollar brothel madam she is alleged to be

The relationship between her and 
former lawyer Peter Gleason was also questioned today as her new 
criminal defense attorney Gary Greenwald took over the case.

Gleason had offered his $2.5 million 
loft for Anna Gristina's bond, saying his client doesn't have 'two 
nickels to rub together' and also invited the 44-year-old and her family
to move in, with the 'madam' being placed under house arrest.

Judge Juan Merchan, who is hearing the case, said he won't decide today on the unusual bail proposal.

Gristina
intends to file a new application 'as soon as possible' to get out of 
her isolation cell at the grim Riker's Island prison.

It comes as prosecutors submitted court papers that highlight the 'murky' relationship between Gristina and Gleason.

In
a seven-page brief, prosecutors question the lawyer's request to put up
his own $2.5 million Tribeca loft to secure Gristina’s release from 
prison and his offer to put the family up in his home.

Suspicions: The relationship between Peter Gleason and Anna Gristina is questioned by prosecutors as he announced today he is no longer representing her

According to the New York Daily News,
the Manhattan prosecutors wrote to the judge: 'The arrangement would 
also be fraught with potential problems. For example, Mr Gleason might 
find that the defendant and her family are unpleasant house guests and 
want them to leave.

'He
may also learn facts as a result of sharing living space with the 
defendant that prevent him from advancing certain arguments on her 
behalf.'

They
also noted that his public statements about his client so far 'paint a 
murky picture of the nature of his relationship with the defendant'.

'Mr
Gleason also stated that he did not care whether the defendant was 
guilty or innocent, a sentiment one might expect from a close friend, 
but less so from one’s defense counsel,' the papers said.

Gleason also said today he's no longer representing Gristina, but the housing offer still stands.

Her new criminal defense lawyer is Gary 
Greenwald - who represented mobster Vincent 'Chin' Gigante.

Meanwhile, it has emerged that DNA 
evidence from the Upper East Side 'brothel' may reveal the identities of
the wealthy and powerful clients who were entertained there by 
high-class hookers.

On the same day as police busted the 
pig-lover while she was meeting with a Morgan Stanley banker - who has 
since been put on leave - Manhattan DA investigators raided her 78th 
Street apartment and removed several items, including toothbrushes and 
hairbrushes, which are considered 'vital evidence'.

'They could potentially be used for DNA 
testing, hair analysis to identify people who have been using that 
location,' Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Roper told Judge Juan Merchan last
month as she asked him to sign off a search warrant, according to court documents obtained by The New York Post.

New Representation: Attorney Gary Greenwald leaves State Supreme Court after representing Anna Gristina, following her previous lawyer Peter Gleason stepping down

Accused of providing pricey prostitutes for 15 years and touting ties to
law enforcement, Gristina has been held on $2million bond since her 
February arraignment.

Prosecutors have said her wealthy clients could 
help her flee the country to protect themselves, and they suggest the British citizen may 
have money hidden away for such purposes.

The DNA evidence from the seized items may be used to identify some of New York's elite who frequented the brothel, which are said to include politicians, hedge funders, CEOs and even royalty.

So far, Gristina has refused to give up
information about her wealthy clients to investigators despite hours of grilling and demands she identify suspects from a list. 

She told the Post how a revolving team 
of investigators, each increasingly higher in rank, showed her a list of
about ten names and demanded she told them what they needed.

The 44-year-old told the New York Post in an interview from Rikers Island prison: 'I'd rather bite my tongue off before I tell you anything.'

She also insisted she had no hidden stash of money or had made millions of dollars from any prostitution empire, as has been alleged.

Gleason said on Wednesday about his unusual proposal that he'd admired people who 'were defined as much as 
by what they were willing to risk as by what they accomplished', and 
he'd made the offer in that spirit.

'There are ethical concerns,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Charles Linehan told a court on Monday.

State Supreme Court Justice Merchan said he didn't think there was 
an ethics problem but wanted to explore the issue further.

While not unheard-of, it's certainly unconventional for lawyers to post 
bail for clients.

Gristina, and co-defendant Jaynie Baker, 30, have pleaded not guilty
to promoting prostitution.

Their lawyers have said they were working 
together to start a business as matchmakers, not madams.

Baker was released on Tuesday on $100,000 bond after turning herself in following three weeks on the run. She appeared in court looking chic and sophisticated to plead not guilty to the charge.

Gristina's husband Kelvin Gorr made a visit to Rikers Island yesterday to bring his wife a new set of clothes for today's hearing, so she 'doesn't have to wear that herringbone jacket' she has been seen sporting at the last two court appearances.

Meanwhile, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly
said on Wednesday that a police sergeant had been cleared of any 
wrongdoing after internal-affairs investigators interviewed him in the 
matter.

Support: Husband Kelvin Gorr visited his wife at Rikers Island yesterday to bring her a change of clothes so she 'doesn't have to wear that herringbone jacket' again

Sgt Richard Wall had been ordered to turn over his work log for the 
past five years after someone reported he had been to the Upper East 
Side apartment building where prosecutors say Gristina arranged trysts.

Kelly said Wall was assigned to the area and went to the building on 
police work. Wall's lawyer had said the sergeant had nothing to do with 
Gristina.
