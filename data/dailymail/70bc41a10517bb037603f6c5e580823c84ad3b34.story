In the market for a new home? A 1960's cold wold missile silo with a fully converted bunker can be all yours for just $750,000.

The missile silo, located Lewis, New York, that once held an Atlas missile, but was decommissioned in 1960 and emptied of all sensitive equipment, is now being sold as a one family home.

Complete with escape hatches, warning signs, rooms filled with control panels, one bedroom, and one bath, the silo sits on 8.3 acres of upstate farm land with a beautiful waterfront view on to the foot of the Adirondack mountains.

The Property: Seen from an aerial view, this decommissioned Cold War missile silo in Lewis, New York is being sold as a single family for $750K. The silo lies on 8.3 acres of upstate farm land

View: The missile silo sits on 8.3 acres of land that looks out on to the Adirondack mountains. The property also has a private pond and stream running through it

Underground: The bedroom is located in the silo's underground bunker in what used to be the Launch Control Center

Realtor Brian Dominic told KGW Portland that the house is so popular, his company is charging $375 just to see it.

'We'll probably get 1,000 inquiries via emails, probably 100 phone calls and that will lead to a handful of people that will actually visit the property,' Dominic told the station.

The two-story missile silo has 32,000 square feet, and is equipped with one bedroom, a utilitarian 'cook top' kitchen, and one full bath.

However the perspective home is bit of a fixer-upper, as the listing notes the basement is partially unfinished.

Secure: The Cold War missile bunker is fully equipped with heavy gun-metal gray blast doors that are both a good security system and can withstand nuclear fallout

Equipment: The missile silo comes fully stocked with old military equipment, that though it no longer works makes for interesting home decorations

Silo: The old missile silo that used to hold the Atlas missile now stand empty and rusted after years of disuse

Industrial: The decommissioned missile military complex looks less homey and more industrial with metal grates and steel doors throughout it

The silo-home is even located in a good school district, according to the online listing.

No longer an active missile base, the silo is still full of quirky details that do have a certain Cold War charm.

The rooms are filled with light up control stations, heavy metal doors, and rusted military equipment, as well as, 'ominous red lights, blast doors, and an emergency exit,' according to Realtor.com.

Rooms: The missile silo comes complete with a utilitarian kitchen that's advertised as having a refrigerator and 'cook top'

Living space: The living room is located in the old launch control center and furnished with authentic retro looking furniture

Command Center: Throughout the silo are pieces of old non-working military machinery, and in this room the realtors even included yellow hard hats as an authentic decorative touch

Communal: The silo's bathroom, like its other rooms, is very simple. Resembling a public school bathroom, the water closet has a multiple-person sink

The realtors have even stocked the house with yellow hard hats and army green jumpsuits for people who really want to get into the spirit of the complex.

Though the missile has long since been removed from the property, the empty air shaft can function as an impromptu skylight for the open-minded homeowner.

Built over 50 years ago the silo has the full amenities of modern living 
including a well drilled septic system, a propane water heater, cooling system for the whole house, and satellite dishes.

Military: The underground home has a wall adorned with clocks representing different time zones for the old occupants who potentially couldn't get out to see the light of day

Equipment: Though it no longer works, the missile silo is filled with old monitoring equipment that imaginative residents can play with and pretend to be living in the bunker 50 years ago

Authentic: The reality company hung olive green coveralls in the silo for those residents who want to get the full nuclear missile bunker experience

Other structures on the property include outbuilding, a storage shed, and a barn, for those who intent to farm on the property.

The only caveat is that living in a bunker can feel restrictive, as the rooms are located in the formed Launch Control Center and lit with hanging overhead lights and no natural light.

Tunnels: Occupants can move from room to room in the underground missile bunker by a series of lit tunnels

Space: Aside from the living areas, the rest of the 185 feet deep structure is full of numerous rooms containing old operating stations and out-of-work control panels

Outdoors: On the expansive property, that includes a paved road to the silo, there is a barn, storage shed, outbuildings, and 8.3 acres of green grass and trees

Missile: Included in the realtor's listing as a diagram of the original Atlas missile that the silo housed during the Cold War

But if occupants ever feel claustrophobic they can simply venture 
outside to explore the grounds and look out on to the pond or at the foliage dotted mountains in the distance.

And if there is ever a nuclear war, consider yourself prepared.
