Cutting it fine: Over 90% of doctors say NHS training is not enough to be able to carry out facelifts

Doctors and patients have overwhelmingly called for the introduction of new specialist training for cosmetic surgeons to remove cowboy practices from the industry.

The latest survey, the results of which are exclusive to The Mail on Sunday, polled 500 clinicians and 2,000 women and was carried out to coincide with the UK’s largest plastic surgery conference, next month’s Clinical Cosmetic and Reconstructive Expo (CCR Expo).

Hundreds of doctors said newly qualified consultants were not competent enough to perform specialist operations like boob jobs and facelifts – despite the fact there is currently  no requirement for them to complete any further accredited training.

Only seven per cent – just one in 14 clinicians – said they believed NHS training alone was enough.

About
 a third of doctors said clinicians should undergo at least three 
months’ training before injecting cosmetic fillers and Botox.

The same 
number thought medics should have a minimum of three months’ training to
 carry out laser treatment for acne, skin rejuvenation and hair removal.

Three-quarters
 of women would feel more confident having cosmetic surgery if doctors 
were forced to  take a special qualification.

Patients thought training 
for fillers and Botox ought to last at least six months.

The
 shock results are revealed days after Health Education England (HEE) 
released the first part of its review into training for non-surgical 
cosmetic procedures.

Officials have recommended that anyone injecting 
Botox or fillers has specialist qualifications.

The
 proposals include undertaking minimum training hours, being taught to 
spot patients with mental health issues and shadowing clinicians – they 
will be allowed to inject patients only once deemed competent.

In their hands: There is currently no requirement for newly qualified consultants to complete any further accredited training after that provided by the NHS

The
 Mail on Sunday’s long-running Stop The Cosmetic Surgery Cowboys 
campaign calls for tougher regulation.

We want a minimum standard for 
surgeons, proper regulation for those practising cosmetic surgery and an
 end to hard-sell tactics.

Overwhelmingly, doctors felt professional associations such as the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and the British College of Aesthetic Medicine should be responsible for training.

Many specialists will argue that the HEE proposals don’t go far enough. For example, the HEE is not expected to recommend a mandatory register of accredited clinics.

The organisation Save Face is compiling a voluntary register of non-surgical cosmetic practitioners who are thoroughly vetted by doctors before being accredited – so consumers can have confidence in selecting a clinic.
