The cry of an elephant is iconic, as it raises its long trunk and lets out a loud, instantly recognisable screech.

But the mammals also produce a much lower-frequency rumble, beyond the reach of human hearing, that is believed to be a language.

Now, a team from New York is analysing more than 300,000 hours of audio of this secret communication to decipher what the various grumbles mean.

Researchers from The Elephant Listening Project in New York are analysing more than 300,000 hours of low-frequency rumbles made by elephants, recorded using infrasonic microphones placed in the rainforests of Central Africa. They're hoping to decipher the mammal's secret language

Elephant vocalisations, or calls, range from 90 to 117 decibels - the equivalent to heavy truck traffic or a construction site.

Low-frequency sounds travel well over long distances and this means an elephants’ infrasonic call means they can stay in contact as they move separately over large areas of savannah or forest.

Playback experiments found that free-ranging savannah elephants respond to one another’s calls over up to 2.5 miles (4km) during daylight hours. 

Elephants produce sounds in much
 the same way as humans do, by using their vocal folds to generate frequency and then modifying the sound’s structure by 
‘filtering’ it with the shape of their mouth cavity and the nasal 
passages.

However, the nasal passage of an elephant is very different to a human's and gives an extra six feet of ‘filter’ to use
 if they want to.

The recordings were taken by researchers from The Elephant Listening Project with the Bioacoustics Research Program (BRP) at The Cornell Lab of Ornithology in New York.

Set up in 1999, the project has placed highly-sensitive infrasonic microphones within the rainforests of Central Africa.

Lead researcher Katy Payne said she was inspired when she first ‘felt’ the low-frequency rumbling communication of two Asian elephants – a male and a female – in Portland Zoo in 1984.

The sounds the creatures make are usually below the range of human hearing and carry over large distances.

Early research focused on communication between savannah elephants, but this has been shifted to the forest elephants of Africa.

The prominence of very low frequencies is a defining characteristic of all three species of elephants, according to the project.

Sounds are generally considered to be infrasonic if their frequency is less than 20Hz -the lower limit of human hearing.

'As we consider the size of elephants’ sensory world, the timing as well as the frequency and power of their vocalisations turns out to be important,’ said the project’s website. 

This video records the moment when elephants Kate and Tess were reunited after being separated for months. They use a variety of high- and low-frequency rumbles to express their feelings about seeing each other again and project is looking to identify the different types of communication

This spectrogram reveals the readings of rumble vocalisations made by forest elephants, recorded by the project's microphones. The frequency, or tone, scale runs from 0 to 420Hz. The blue line near the bottom is the lower limit of human hearing sensitivity

‘On a typical dry season evening in the savannah a temperature inversion forms, potentially increasing the listening area of elephants as much as ten-fold.

‘In light of this fact it is interesting that savannah elephants make most of their loud low-frequency calls during the hours of best sound propagation.

'We do not know whether this is an innate or opportunistic response to fluctuations in the size of their communication area, but in either case it is clear that as the area shrinks and expands, so does the network of potential associates and mates.’

The project's research has also discovered that elephants speak with two voices. They either talk through their mouths, or from the end of their trunks, and the rumbles produced by the two regions are different. As a result, the project now wants to discover if they are used for different types of communication

This finding offers a solution to mysteries about elephant societies, in particular how males find females for breeding.

It also gives an insight into the ability of separated family groups to coordinate their movements for weeks at a time without losing communication or eating the same scarce resources.
