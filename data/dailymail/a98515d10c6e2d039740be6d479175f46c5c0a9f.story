A bride who described herself as 'fat, frumpy and uncomfortable in her own skin' dropped a staggering five dress sizes and nearly halved her body weight for her wedding day.

Liz Evans lost more than five stone in less than eight months meaning she could tie the knot in a size eight dress rather than a size 18.

The 27-year-old, who once tipped the scales at more than 14 stone, has now been named Slimming World's Miss Slinky 2013.

Big loser: Liz Evans lost more than five stone in less than eight months meaning she could tie the knot in a size eight dress rather than a size 18

Speaking about her weight insecurities prior to her wedding she said: 'I knew I wouldn't be able to relax and enjoy myself,

'I knew my fiance Fran loved me whatever size I was but I was determined that I wasn't going to feel that way on my wedding day, so on 3 January last year I went along to my first Slimming World group.

Achievement: Prior to her wedding, she described herself as fat, frumpy and uncomfortable in her own skin but now loves being able to wear fashionable outfits and has a new found confidence

'After losing 5st I felt 
fantastic on the day in August and even wore a bikini on my honeymoon, 
but the best thing is that I finally feel normal - not fat or frumpy.'

Mrs Evans, from Liverpool, began to battle with her weight in her teens.

'When I started high school, I stopped doing ballet and going swimming and I'd buy chocolate and crisps from the vending machines,' she said.

'That's when I started to put on weight.

'After leaving school, I made the excuse that I was too busy to eat healthily and my weight went up and up.'

The extra pounds began to take their toll on her health and Mrs Evans suffered from high blood pressure and heart palpitations.

Great job! Liz says she is now the lightest she has been since school - and has lost the equivalent in weight as a heavy suitcase

What a lightweight! Liz with her husband Fran Evans

The admin assistant for Jaguar, who is studying to become a midwife, now weighs 8st 13lb.

She said the weight loss programme completely changed her life.

She is now the lightest she has been since school.

'Doing 13-hour shifts and being on my feet all day as a student midwife was horrendous,' she added.

'But now it's much easier and I don't feel like a hypocrite when I'm talking to mums-to-be about healthy eating and nutrition.

'And
I love being able to go into a shop and pick up something in a size 8 
or 10 and know it'll fit - I can wear fashionable outfits and share 
clothes with my friends now.

'When we went on honeymoon, we weighed our cases and they were 32kg.

'I couldn't even pick them up but before I lost weight I was carrying around that weight every day - it's hard to believe.

'I've been at my target weight for five months now and I know I'll never go back to the old Liz.'
