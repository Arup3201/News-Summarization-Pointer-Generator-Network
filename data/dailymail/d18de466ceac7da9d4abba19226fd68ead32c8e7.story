The websites dedicated to raising money for Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson have mysteriously stopped accepting donations after collecting nearly half a million dollars - and it's not clear why. 

Since Wilson's name was released to the public on August 15, two GoFundMe pages have raised more than $433,000 to pay  legal bills and other costs associated with his fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

By Sunday, however, both pages were no longer accepting money, giving donors the message: 'Donations are Complete! The organizer has stopped donations.'

Wilson has been in hiding since he was identified as the officer who killed Brown. The teen was shot at least six times in a Ferguson street. Wilson, through friends, has said he was justified in opening fire. However, residents of mostly black Ferguson are furious and the shooting sparked several days of protests.

Giving help: Two funds for Officer Darren Wilson have mysteriously stopped accepting donations after raising nearly half a million dollars for him

The shooting is currently under investigation by the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney, as well as the Justice Department. Brown's family and supporters are calling for Wilson to be charged with murder

A GoFundMe page supporting Brown's family has raised $315,000. It is still collecting money. 

George Zimmerman raised more than $300,000 for his legal defense

The Los Angeles Times reports that a GoFundMe spokeswoman said that company is not responsible for halting donation to the sites 'Support Officer Darren Wilson' and 'Support Officer Wilson.' 

More than 10,000 people have donated to the two campaigns - with an average donation of about $40. Some donors, however, gave thousands. One contributed $10,000. 

'Support Officer Wilson' - which has raised $197,620 - is run by St. Louis police charity Shield of Hope. That charity's directors are Timothy Zoll, a public information officer for the Ferguson Police Department, Jeffrey Roorda, a Missouri state representative, and Joseph Eagan, a city councilman in the St. Louis County town of Florissant - near Ferguson. 

'Support Office Darren Wilson' has raised $235,550 and is run by an anonymous GoFundMe user. 

However, a GoFundMe spokeswoman told the Times that the company could vouch for the user and that they had verified the person collecting the cash.

That page is run by a user with the username StandUp - but provides no information about the person or group collecting the donations. Even an email address provided for the page offers no identifying information about the administrators. 

The organizers had pledged to work with Shield of Hope to ensure the donations go to the right place - but so far, that has not happened.  

After George Zimmerman was arrested and charged with the murder of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, his supporters raised more than $300,000 online to help pay for his legal defense and living expenses while he was in hiding.
