Taxpayer-owned Royal Bank of Scotland must not be allowed to double its bonus cap, Labour warned today.

George Osborne is facing calls to reject any demand for RBS to increase its payouts to senior staff in the City.

David Cameron announced that cash payouts would be capped at £2,000 but RBS is expected to invoke an EU rule that allows it to pay bonuses in shares up to double an employee's salary - twice the normal rate - provided they are approved by the shareholders.

However Labour's call for a cap on bonuses was dismissed as unworkable by Bank of England governor Mark Carney.

RBS is 82-per cent owned by the government, making Mr Osborne effectively the largest shareholder.

Labour will force a vote on the issue in the Commons today calling on the Government to reject any request to raise the bonus cap.

At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron said: 'I can confirm today that just as we have had limits on cash bonuses of £2,000 at RBS this year and last year, we will do the same next year as well.'

He added: 'If there are any proposals to increase the overall pay, that is pay and bonus bill at RBS, at the investment bank, any proposals for that, we will veto it.'

However, Labour insisted that shares bonuses worth double salaries should not be allowed to go ahead.

Labour’s shadow treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie said: ‘At a time when families face a cost-of-living crisis and bank lending to business is falling, it cannot be right for George Osborne to approve a doubling of the bank bonus cap.’

He denied want to ‘hobble RBS, but insisted allowing bankers to be paid double their salary was an ‘astonishing thing to do’.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I think it’s a matter of embarrassment that UK policy on bonuses was not determined by the UK Treasury, it was left to the European Union to take action.’

New laws which came into effect on January 1 mean that bonuses must not be higher than 100 per cent of a banker’s salary.

But it can be raised to 200 per cent if shareholders approve.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney said he does not back a 'crude bonus cap' on pay in banks or proposals to restrict their size.

He said he 'absolutely' agreed with the conclusions of the parliamentary commission on banking standards that it was not convinced a 'crude bonus cap' was the right way to control pay.

However, Tory MP Mark Garnier said banker bonuses should be seen as ‘compensation for enterprise’.

‘The whole point about these bonuses is you shouldn't be talking about them in terms of a kind of 'reward', it’s actually a compensation for enterprise,’ he told Radio 4.

‘Let's not forget, investment banks do a lot of good as well as bad, they do a lot of good in terms of raising capital in British industry.’

He insisted there has been a ‘huge amount of work’ done by the regulators to reform the bonus structure in banks, including removing ‘perverse incentives and perverse outcomes’ of large short-term pay-outs encouraging excessive risk-taking.

A Treasury spokesman said: 'Our normal principles apply. There needs to be restraint. Bonuses need to be significantly down on where they were at the time of the crisis and in the last parliament.'
