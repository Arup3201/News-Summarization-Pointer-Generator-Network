TV watchdog Ofcom has launched an investigation into ITV's I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! after producers used the young daughter of EastEnders star Charlie Brooks in a stunt.

Charlie Brooks, 31, who plays Janine in the BBC1 
soap, had to choose from a selection of doors with different prices behind them, one of which was her seven-year-old daughter Kiki, but picked the wrong one.

The actress, who was later crowned the winner of the competition, did not know Kiki would be taking part in the trial and called the task her 'lowest point'.

Communications regulator Ofcom is set to investigate the circumstances of the stunt and whether ITV's production team stepped out of line allowing Kiki to take part.

The watchdog, which received 66 complaints 
about the episode, will also look into whether the offence caused to viewers was justified by the 
context.

Ms Brooks told The Sun after the show: 'I signed up for this show, but Kiki didn’t. I didn’t want her to be so upset. I had no idea this was happening. It was my lowest point.

'My mum gave the green light for her to be there because it was an opportunity for Kiki to see me — and I think she thought she would.'

Ms Brooks said she felt as though she'd been 'kicked' when she realised what had happened and added that the incident was perhaps 'a step too far' by the production team.

Charlie added: 'I kept picturing 
Kiki’s face. She would have been excited about seeing me and nervous 
about being on the show — and then disappointed when we failed the task.

'Afterwards
I went straight up and spoke to the show bosses. They said she ‘had a 
moment’, but assured me she was OK after they gave her a bowl of ice 
cream.'

A show spokesperson told MailOnline 
at the time: 'The permission came from Kiki's grandmother [Charlie's 
mother], who was with Kiki the whole time.

'They
were both fully briefed on how the game would work and were both happy 
to take part.  A senior producer saw them both afterwards and they were 
fine.

'Kiki and her 
grandma come to the jungle every day with the other friends and family, 
so actually the experience wasn't as out of the ordinary as it might 
look.'

Despite assurances from the I'm A Celebrity... production 
team, campaign group Parents Outloud said: 'To involve a 
seven-year-old is sinking to the bottom.'

Under the broadcasting code, due care 
must be taken over the physical and emotional welfare of under-18s 
irrespective of any consent given by a parent or guardian and under-18s 
must not be caused unnecessary distress or anxiety from their 
involvement in programmes.
