Richard McKee, 65, previously a judge at the highest asylum and immigration court has stepped down

A judge accused of going soft on foreign criminals has stepped down after admitting handing cash to an illegal immigrant who had lived in his home.

Richard McKee, 65, was a senior judge at the country’s highest immigration and asylum court when he gave money to the woman, who is 26 years his junior, while she was living here illegally.

The Nigerian woman, Fatima Umar, 39, was found to have overstayed her visa after she was arrested at Mr McKee’s house after a disagreement.

She now faces being deported.

Mr McKee, who has previously been accused of ruling far more often than other judges in favour of those seeking to avoid deportation, has been allowed to retire on a pension of around £50,000 a year without disciplinary action.

Police had been called to Mr McKee’s £460,000 flat in Kilburn, North West London, in the afternoon of January 28 after a report of a break-in.

Umar was arrested and charged with causing around £5,000 of criminal damage at the property and assaulting two police officers.

She is now serving two eight-week prison sentences.

When the judiciary was informed that Mr McKee had been providing financial support to an illegal immigrant he was allowed to retire without any penalty.

It is thought that Mr McKee had allowed the ‘pretty’ younger woman to live at his property on and off for the last few years. He has refused to comment on the nature of their relationship.

In 2011, Umar was sentenced to 14 weeks in jail after she assaulted the judge.

Last year, Mr McKee was given a reprimand for falling ‘short of the standards expected’ of judges after he failed to inform the judiciary that police were investigating the use of his ‘premises’ for unlawful activities.

One of Mr McKee’s neighbours last night said that Umar was attractive, but seemed like she had problems.

The woman said: ‘She was a really nice lady, very friendly and polite and she would always ask how my children were. She was very skinny and pretty.

‘But she looked like she was off it most of the time. Whether it was drugs or alcohol, I don’t know, but she always looked pretty much out of it.’

On the day she was arrested, neighbours said she was taken from the property kicking and screaming.

Mr
 McKee, a Cambridge graduate, worked for the Immigration Advisory 
Service as a barrister in the 1990s, bringing appeals for immigrants and
 asylum seekers, before he started adjudicating on cases in 2000.

An 
analysis of his judgments in 2012 found that in the 13 cases he heard in
 the previous year, he ruled in favour of foreign criminals wanting to 
avoid deportation on 11 occasions.

At the same time another judge ruled against all nine criminals whose cases he heard.

A
 spokesman for the Judiciary said: ‘On 31 January 2014 it was brought to
 the Chamber President’s attention that Upper Tribunal Judge McKee was 
providing financial support to a person who was alleged to be an 
immigration offender.

‘This was put to Mr McKee who then retired with
 effect from 4 February.’ He said there would not be a review of Mr 
McKee’s rulings as ‘this is a personal conduct matter’.

A 
Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Fatima Umar is currently serving an
 eight-week sentence after admitting one count of criminal damage and 
three counts of assault at Hendon Magistrates’ Court on January 30 this 
year.’

Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab criticised the decision to 
allow Mr McKee to retire with a full pension. He said: ‘It beggars 
belief that a judge tasked with defending our borders has been helping 
someone who has flouted them, only to walk away with a full pension. 
Those who uphold the law should not be above the law.’

Yesterday, Mr McKee said: ‘I’m sorry, I can’t really say anything.’

Between June 2011 and May 2012, Mr McKee, 64, heard 13 cases involving criminals appealing against deportation, and in 11 of them he ruled in favour of the criminal bringing the appeal.

Criminals he allowed to stay included Congolese national Wabi Longange, a failed asylum seeker found guilty of causing the death of a woman passenger by careless driving, and an Australian man, known only by the initials CB, who sexually assaulted a 17-year-old girl he had fostered eight years previously.

He also let Algerian illegal immigrant Amar Chennaoui, 43, stay after he was jailed for two-and-a-half years for unlawful wounding.
