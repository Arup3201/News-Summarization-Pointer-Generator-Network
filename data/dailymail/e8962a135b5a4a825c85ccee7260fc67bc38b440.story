Rumours suggest that Facebook is about to add video features to its photo-sharing app Instagram and will announce the changes at a conference later this week.

According to an internal source, the social network has been recently testing a feature that would let Instagram users record and share five to 10-second video clips.

If confirmed, the feature will rival video-sharing Vine app - which is owned by Twitter - that lets users record and share six-second video loops on Android and iOS devices.

Facebook has officially revealed a new video sharing service. Called Video on Instagram, it will pit the firm against Twitter's hugely popular Vine service by letting users record 15-second video clips

Last week Facebook announced it was adding clickable hashtags to the site.

When a Facebook user now adds a 
hashtagged word or phrase to a post, other users will be able to click 
it and use it as a search term.

Hashtag phrases include multiple words stringed together.

They
 will be presented with a list of other users across the site that are 
also currently using that word or phrase and discussing the same things.Â 

Other
 users who are also watching the show, or who aren't watching it but are
 interested in following what's happening, can click the hashtag.

The results will be shown as a list that users can scroll through and watch the discussion develop at a glance.

Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 after an alleged bidding war with Twitter.

It is expected to announce updates to the photo-sharing app as well as other products at a press conference scheduled for 20 June.

Freelance journalist Matthew Keys broke the Instagram video story at the end of May.

He claimed a source familiar with the plans had told him Facebook was testing the feature, but didn't want to give their name because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the news.

A number of selected journalists were recently sent an invitation from Facebook that simply read: 'A small team has been working on a big product.

'Join us for a coffee and learn about a new product.' The event is due to take place on 20 June.

Speculation about what Facebook is about to announce has been rife and another rumour suggests the site may also launch a news reader app.

Google announced it would discontinue its own Reader services and app earlier this year and they went offline on 1 June and Facebook could use this to its advantage.

According to TechCrunch, the reader app could be a 'trending articles on Facebook' feature or an 'RSS reader-style product.'

Facebook announced last week it was adding clickable hashtags to the site which make it easier for users to follow discussions about certain topics.

These could also fit with plans for an RSS-reader tool.

Clickable hashtags are already used on Instagram as well as Twitter and Vine.

Twitter bought Vine in October last year.

The app initially launched on iOS devices before being made available for Android phones earlier this month.

Vine has previously been used to record surgical operations and at the start of June a 16-year-old claimed he had managed to crash the app by uploading a Rick Astley music video.

The video bypassed the app's six-second limit which is thought to have caused the servers to temporarily crash.
