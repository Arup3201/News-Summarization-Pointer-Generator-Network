The Premier League are considering a cash prize as part of their plans to overhaul the Under 21 competition.

A prize money boost - worth £10m, according to The Sun - is one of a number of ideas being looked at in an attempt to revamp the youth league.

More matches in main stadiums, live television broadcasts and advertising arrangements are also on the Premier League's agenda to try and make the U21 league better resemble the senior league.

The League's ultimate goal is to give youngsters high-quality matches and better prepare them for when their chance in the first team comes along.

It is hoped the plan would remove the need to involve clubs in the current football league system, as proposed by FA Chairman Greg Dyke in his B league plans - a new tier from 2016-17, between League Two and the Conference.

Liverpool's clash with Manchester United will be televised live on BT Sport, MUTV and Liverpool TV from Anfield this Friday night.

West Ham's U21 side will take on Southampton at the same time at Upton Park and next Thursday, August 28 will see Arsenal's young guns take on West Brom at the Emirates Stadium. 

Sportsmail revealed earlier in August that the Premier League would unveil a European cup competition featuring the top eight clubs from the U21 Premier League.
