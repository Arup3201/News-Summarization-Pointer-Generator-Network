It was a scene perhaps more fitting for a galaxy far, far away,

But the force was strong this weekend as Star Wars fanatics Russell Ellis and Paloma Mota, of Knoxville, tied the knot - dressed in full sci-fi fancy dress.

The couple - who met a year ago - decided they did not want 'anything traditional' for their big day and struck upon the idea for the intergalactic themed wedding.

Mr Ellis told the Knoxville News: 'She said, "We should have a Star
 Wars wedding. But I want a small Star Wars wedding". There's no such 
thing. This is going to be fun.'

More than 30 guests entered the spirit of the day with a role in the ceremony, with Stormtroopers ushering guests to their seats, and the bride - dressed as Princess Leia -  escorted down the aisle by a fearsome looking Darth Maul.

A working R2-D2 robot carried the ring, which according to groom Mr Ellis - dressed of course as Luke Skywalker  - cost almost as much as the Death Star.

The ceremony, which included vows read from a seven page script, took place at Gatlinburg Lodge, Tennessee.
