A two-year-old girl has died in hospital days after her stepfather shook her until she suffered a brain hemorrhage, police said.

Thaiya Spruill-Smith was rushed to Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday after her 24-year-old mother Teoka Spruill noticed she was struggling to breathe.

Despite numerous operations, doctors last night concluded Thaiya's head injuries were too severe to overcome, and she was taken off life support.

It has since emerged that Thaiya may have been the victim of months of abuse at the hands of her stepfather that was investigated by New York City social services.

Relatives have made emotional tributes to the 'smart' and 'sweet' girl as her mother's husband David Adams, 25, appeared in court charged with inflicting the fatal wounds.

'Thai, she was like the sweetest little girl ever, like you wouldn't have problems with her ever,' Shayne Smith, Thaiya's uncle, told Time Warner Cable.

'She was very smart - very, very smart.'

According to court documents, Adams admitted to shaking Thaiya when questioned.

And police sources say there are records of a similar shaking incident in the household last month.

Judge Michael Gerstein plans to upgrade Adams' charge from assault to attempted murder once Thaiya's autopsy has been carried out, the New York Daily News reported. 

Adams, who married Thaiya's mother in March, wept before prosecutors in court as they told him the two-year-old had died.

'He was shocked. He was very, very upset,' defense attorney Joseph Sieger told the New York Post. 

Thaiya's father Terrell Smith, 26, said social services took custody of the little girl for a week while they investigated Adams for abuse.

She was returned and the case was dropped, he said.

The ACS has refused to confirm or deny Smith's claims due to confidentiality restrictions.

Paramedics were called to the home in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn shortly before 7am on Thursday.

According to Smith, she had already had the injuries for days.

Spruill, Thaiya's mother, is the half-sister of Tiona Rodriguez, who was caught carrying her dead baby son in a plastic bag in Victoria's Secret last year, then aged 17.
