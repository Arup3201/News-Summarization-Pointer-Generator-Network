It's the world's most watched sporting event, with 100 million viewers tuning in each year for a glimpse of the colourfully garbed cheerleaders, the high octane half time entertainment, and, of course, the on-pitch action.

But if the thought of American football leaves you flummoxed - and let's face it, it's a complicated game - then FEMAIL can help.

We asked the game's top players and leading commentators to explain why the Super Bowl is worth staying up for.

THE GAME EXPLAINED

From the British perspective, American football looks very much like a game of rugby, albeit with added padding.

But that's not so, says Nat Coombs, NFL presenter for Channel 4. Instead, he says, it's all about possession which means risks, thrills and spills crop up far more often.

'The ball changes hands far less frequently than in football or rugby,' he reveals. 'So teams like to protect the ball much more than they do in other sports, which means they take less risks.'

For those who have absolutely no idea what it all means, he explains: 'The objective is drive the ball
 down the field as efficiently as you can until you score either a 
Touchdown (worth six points, plus a shot at an extra point “conversion”) or a Field Goal (a kick through the upright
 worth three points).

'Teams usually try for a field goal from around 50 yards or nearer - 
often they want to bank the points rather than risk coughing the ball
 back to the other side.'

'American football 
is a really strategic game,' adds American Football aficionado, TV presenter Vernon Kay.

'It’s like chess, only with really, really 
big pieces.'

MEET THE TEAMS

This year's tussle pits the Denver Broncos against the Seattle Seahawks, with the Broncos the favourite to win, largely thanks to efforts of their star quarterback, Peyton Manning.

But according to Matthew Stafford, a quarterback playing for the Detroit Lions, Manning has competition in the shape of his teammate, Knowshon Moreno.

'One player who is flying a little bit 
under the radar is my old College mate Knowshon Moreno – running back 
for the Denver Broncos,' says Stafford.

'If the weather isn’t great in New York he will 
be called on a lot more and I will be looking out for him this weekend.'

The pair will, however, have to overcome the Seahawks' formidable defensive line if they want to take the trophy home and that means getting past the likes of Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas - both of whom came within a whisker of being named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year.

'You’ve got the Seahawks defense, whose 
defensive backs call themselves the Legion of Boom,' enthuses Kay.

'I love that. Any 
part of a team that has a nickname should be commended. They’ve got 
great defensive players all over their team, and that’s why they’ve 
conceded so few points over the season – an average of just 14 points 
per game.'

'The Super Bowl happens just once every 
year and the two best teams in the world meet for the ultimate prize in [American]
football,' adds Stafford. 'Whatever happens it is going to be exciting.'

HOW TO STAY ENTERTAINED

Along with eating your own weight in nachos and watching the action, according to Kay, drinking games are a popular way to keep your spirits up while play continues.

'There’s been a lot of talk 
about [Denver Broncos quarterback] Payton Manning ahead of the game, and about how one of the calls 
he makes at the line of scrimmage [see Nat Coomb's explanation below] is Omaha,' he explains.

'If you go to Twitter, 
there’s a fantastic Omaha drinking game. It’s one way of entertaining 
yourself during the game. Not that I’m encouraging drinking during 
football, of course. But it’s very funny!'

HALF TIME FUN

He might not have the glamour of last year's halftime performer, Beyonce, but Bruno Mars certainly knows how to knock out a tune.

One of the youngest performers ever to perform during the Super Bowl, the 28-year-old star will be joined on stage by veteran rockers, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.

'The Super Bowl is just such an amazing spectacle,' adds Stafford. 'Everything that goes into it, helps make it the biggest sporting event in the world.

'From the half time 
shows to the TV adverts this is the game everyone wants to be involved 
in.'

NFL is a game of possession

The ball changes hands far less frequently than football or rugby. So teams like to protect the ball much more than they do in other sports, which means they take less risks.  

Broadcaster Alistair Cooke compared the strategy found in the NFL to a game of chess and the surface level complexity of the game – each man has a very clear, mapped out set of objectives for each play – sometimes confuses the newbie fan. But although it’s highly technical in some respects, it’s ultra simple at the core.  

The objectives explained

Drive the ball down the field as efficiently as you can until you score either a Touchdown (worth six points, plus a shot at an extra point “conversion”)  or a Field Goal (a kick through the upright worth three points) which teams usually try from circa 50 yards or nearer, often if they want to bank the points rather than risk coughing the ball back to the other side.

It's ALL about possession

The team with the ball (the offense) has four shots (downs) at advancing it a minimum of 10 yards and this is all run by its offensive general, the Quarterback.  

If they make the 10 yards (or more) they get another four chances, and this keeps on going till they get the ball into the EndZone (for a touch down) or decide to kick the Field Goal or if they give the ball back to the opposition, consciously or otherwise.

Here's how things can go wrong...

If they feel that they’re in danger of losing possession – they need too many yards to guarantee another set of downs, or its too far for a Field Goal attempt - then they’ll punt (kick, like an supersized up and under) the ball back to the other side who promptly try and take the ball back up the field the other way to score.

They can also lose possession by fumbling - losing control of the ball allowing the other team to gain it, or via an interception which is when the quarterback throws it and a defender catches it instead of the intended target.

And don't forget the opposing team!

Oh, and while the Offense is trying to get lucky, the opposing team’s Defense is trying to nail each and every one of them.
