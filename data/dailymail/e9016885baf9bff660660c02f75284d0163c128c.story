Retailer John Lewis has refused to help a campaign to save orphaned penguins, despite their successful Christmas TV advert being based on the animals.

Earlier this month, Bristol Zoological Society launched an appeal to raise £20,000 for their centre in South Africa to help care for the chicks, which had been abandoned by their parents.

The centre had come under increasing financial pressure due to the number of young penguins having to be cared for and the rise in fish prices.

The zoo decided to ask the retailer for help in light of their highly successful Christmas ad, which tells the story of a young boy who finds a companion for his lonely penguin, Monty

As part of the appeal, the zoo decided to ask the retailer for a donation in light of their highly successful Christmas commercial.

It tells the story of a young boy who realises his lonely Adelie penguin, Monty, is longing for a penguin companion.

And so on Christmas morning, the boy surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel.

But despite John Lewis wishing them luck, they said they were unable to help with their campaign as they had already partnered with wildlife conservation charity WWF to support and help protect the habitat of the Adelie penguin.

A spokeswoman for the zoo said: 'As a wildlife conservation charity, we decided to launch a public appeal for starving penguin chicks in South Africa.

'In view of the enormous impact of their Christmas penguin advert, we approached John Lewis to ask them to support our project in the wild; either through helping us to spread the word via their online channels or through financial support.

'We were disappointed to learn that they felt they couldn't contribute neither to help save these endangered creatures.

The charity had asked John Lewis if they would help out with their appeal but the retailer said they were unable to help

Bristol Zoological Society say they were disappointed that John Lewis felt they couldn't help their appeal for the penguins 

'However, we are delighted that many members of the public are supporting this appeal, and remain hopeful that the generosity of the human spirit ensures that the chicks don't go hungry this Christmas.'

A spokeswoman for John Lewis explained that they receive many enquiries asking them to support charitable causes and it is unfortunate they cannot fulfil every request.

She said: 'We receive a high number of charitable requests throughout the year and we are unfortunately unable to support all of these.

'This year for our Christmas advertising campaign we have partnered with WWF and all profit from the CD sales of the Christmas advert single, Real Love, is going towards their Adopt a Penguin programme.

'Since the campaign launched on November 6, along with WWF’s own penguin adoption Christmas activity, WWF has sent out over 2,000 adoptions for Adélie penguins, an increase of over 600 per cent from this time last year.

'We passed our apologies to Bristol Zoo that we are unable to help on this occasion and wish them the best of luck with their campaign.'

Bristol Zoological Society set up and runs the charity SANCCOB, which takes in African penguin chicks, which have been abandoned by the parents.

More than 430 African penguins are being cared for by the charity after being abandoned by their parents 

One of the African penguins is weighed by the staff at the centre in South Africa. There are now fewer than 18,000 breeding pairs left in the wild off the coast of South Africa and Namibia

The bird's population fell by 70 per cent between 2001 and 2013 and there are fewer than 18,000 breeding pairs left in the wild off the South African and Namibian coast.

The charity says that this year, the chicks are coming in early and in their hundreds from the colonies and that they are already helping to care for more than 430 birds.

Staff at the society said the price of fish has sky-rocketed this season and an extra £20,000 is needed before Christmas or they will have to stop taking in animals.

Dr Christoph Schwitzer, Director of Conservation at Bristol Zoological Society said: 'Unless conservation organisations intervene, these chicks will starve to death.

'As African penguin populations are currently facing a crisis due to a diminished food supply near their nesting colonies, there is a substantial risk that this species could eventually become extinct without action.'

Numerous penguin chicks are abandoned around this time of year, just before their parents start their moulting cycle, when they develop a new set of waterproof feathers.

Adult African penguins still need to make foraging trips during this time and leave their chicks behind.
