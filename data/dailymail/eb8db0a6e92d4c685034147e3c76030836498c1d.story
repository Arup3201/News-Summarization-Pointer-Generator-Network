A teenager unintentionally offered to sell drugs to a policeman by mistake after sending a text message to the wrong number, authorities say.

Lorraine Apuzzo, 19, of Storrs, Connecticut, allegedly offered the Meriden officer 200 Percocet pills on Friday by text without realising who he was.

She allegedly carried on exchanging messages with the officer and then arrived at a shopping centre with an accomplice, where she was arrested.

‘The drug dealer thought they'd sent it to someone else,’ Meriden Detective Lieutenant Mark Walerysiak told Southington Patch.

Apuzzo was arrested after police organised an undercover operation and met her at the Westfield Meriden Mall in Meriden, Connecticut.

She arrived there with Frank Boemmels, 25, of Wallingford, Connecticut, but the duo got suspicious and tried to run away, police said.

Apuzzo even allegedly tried to back out of the car park and an officer broke a car window to stop her, reported the Meriden Record-Journal.

‘She began to drive away from them in a reckless manner, going so far as to drive away from them in reverse,’ a police spokesman told Patch.

Police caught Boemmels inside the shopping centre and he was arrested. The duo were allegedly in possession of 100 Percocet pills, reported CBS.

Boemmels was charged with attempting to sell narcotics, conspiracy to sell narcotics and attempting to sell narcotics in a school area.

Apuzzo charged with conspiracy to sell narcotics and conspiracy to sell narcotics in a school area - plus charges of reckless driving, officer interference, pursuit engagement and reckless endangerment.

She is expected to appear in Meriden Superior Court next Thursday, while Boemmels's court date has been reported as Tuesday.

Police now want to find out for whom the drugs were intended - and for whom the text message was supposed to reach, reported CBS.
