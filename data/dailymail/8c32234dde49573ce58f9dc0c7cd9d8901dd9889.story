A couple's crystal ball failed to predict their house bursting into flames - after sun rays bounced off the mystical glass ornament.

Fire crews were called out to control the flames which tore across the living room after a curtain set alight.

Alarmed, the man and woman inside tried to tackle the blaze with a garden hose and towels - before fleeing their home in Romford, Essex.

Carnage: The Romford living room was left blackened after sun rays bounced off the crystal ball on the window sill

The man had been asleep after a night shift when the fire started at 3.30pm on Saturday and was woken up by his smoke alarm.

Fire Investigation Officer Mick Boyle from London Fire Brigade said: 'The blaze caused severe damage to the bedroom but thankfully no one was hurt.

'The man, who was asleep in the bedroom when the fire started, was woken up by the smoke alarm going off. That smoke alarm saved his life - he could easily have slept through and been overcome by smoke.'

The London Fire Brigade has issued a stern warning to homeowners not to keep glass bottles or ornaments on window sills.

Mr Boyle added: 'You can't predict the future, but you can prevent this type of fire by keeping glass ornaments, mirrors, and bottles away from sunny window sills.

'You should never try and fight a fire yourself - they can develop very quickly and you can really put yourself in danger.

'Garden hoses and towels are never going to be enough to extinguish a blaze like this, so the best thing you can do is close the door on the fire, get out, stay out, and dial 999.'
