A major piece of evidence in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin has yet to be analyzed - his cell phone.

Attorneys for shooter George Zimmerman are fighting to get information pulled from phone records in the hope of shedding light on the teenager's death.

The phone was found at the scene with its battery dead on the night that Trayvon Martin was killed on February 26 in Sanford, Florida.

Fighting: George Zimmerman's attorneys want a state order to pull more information from Trayvon Martin's phone

Firestorm: When George Zimmerman's attorney hope there's information on the phone to back his claim that he shot and killed teenager Trayvon Martin in self-defense

It is a two-year-old Huawei U8150 smartphone, sold by T-Mobile as the 'Comet,' which shot video and photos as well as had internet connectivity.

Police have tried without success to download data from the phone. They even asked the teenager's father Tracy Martin for the security codes to unlock it, but after he did not provide them, police gave the phone to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

Mr Martin told them he would check with attorneys but authorities say he never again addressed their request.

He later told reporters he would not help police download information from the phone.

'I don't know anything about that,' said family attorney Benjamin Crump. 'We're going to do anything prosecutors say we should.'

Zimmerman's attorney said that crime-lab specialists have only had partial success retrieving messages and photos from the device.

Without the security code, analysts are unable to unlock the phone and download information from its primary data storage site.

Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said that analysts have only been able to download files from the phone's two removable-storage devices - its SIM card and SD card - but that internal chip has yet to be cracked.

Zimmerman, is charged with second-degree murder in the February killing of Trayvon Martin and has maintained that he acted in self-defense. His attorneys hope information on the phone could back that claim.

It could reveal who and what might have been on Martin's mind at the time of the shooting from his text messages. Attorneys say it could give them a better insight into the 17-year-old through the websites he visited and the photos and video he shot.

The information currently available on the phone 'tells me the last few phone calls, but that's about it,' O'Mara told the Orlando Sentinel. 'It looks like there is other information that I should have.'

Google may be able to bypass the security system because the phone operates with Android software owned by that tech company, said Dave 
Kleiman, a computer forensic technician and expert witness with 
Computer Forensics LLC in West Palm Beach said.

Record: The phone could be a connection to a key witness who claimed to hear Zimmerman demand to know what Trayvon was doing

In a more extreme measure that could destroy the phone, a technician could pull the chip out.

The neither the Florida Department of Law Enforcement or the Special Prosecutor's office have responded to interview requests regarding how they have handled the phone.

FDLE analyst Stephen Brenton analyzed the phone on March 26, but since then it seems that no one has attempted to retrieve information from it.

O'Mara plans to use a December 11 hearing to seek an order for the state to provide more information about the phone.

The phone also provides a connection to a 16-year-old Miami girl who said she was on the phone with Martin just before he was shot.

The witness claimed that Martin had told her he was scared of a man following him, and heard Trayvon have an exchange with an unidentified man demanding to know what he was 'doing around here' before the line went dead.

Backing the girl's account is a phone log of calls that Tracy Martin gave to ABC News.

The last recorded call was 7.12 pm and the shooting happened four minutes later.
