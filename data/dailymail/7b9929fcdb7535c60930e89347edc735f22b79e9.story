A mother-of-three annoyed that her three-year-old son was struggling with potty training shook him so severely that he partially lost his sight, a court has heard.

Chasity Renee DuFour, 25, from Enumclaw, Washington, inflicted numerous violent beatings on the boy that have left him brain damaged, it is claimed.

She then coached her older five-year-old child to lie to police about why the younger boy was 'covered in bruises from head-to-toe'.

Chasity Renee DuFour, 25, inflicted violent beatings on her son that left him brain damaged, it is claimed. The alleged abuse surfaced when the boy was admitted to Mary Bridge Children's Hospital (pictured) in Tacoma, Washington

The alleged abuse came to light when the boy was placed in intensive care at Mary Bridge Childrenâ€™s Hospital in nearby Tacoma suffering from severe head trauma.

Suspicious doctors called police who launched an investigation into the 'life-changing injuries' in late May, reports SeattlePI.com.

DuFour shook or choked the boy so violently that he received significant brain damage, King County Courthouse in Seattle heard last Friday.

Senior Deputy Prosecutor Cecelia Gregory told the hearing: 'The victim was covered in bruises from head-to-toe, partially blinded and will have lasting neurological and physical challenges after suffering repeated assaults at the hands of the defendant.'

DuFour was also seen hitting her son when he urinated in his trousers, prosecutors allege.

When police contacted the defendant the day after the allegations arose, she claimed he may have sustained his injuries by falling off a bed.

She also said she rarely spanked her children, the court was told.

When confronted with the allegations of abuse, DuFour refused to continue speaking with the police.

The detective assigned the case also questionned the boy's father, who is DuFour's boyfriend, and his babysitter.

Both said they had never seen DuFour hit any of her children.

The boy had been living with her at her Enumclaw home since April. The hearing was told she may have found the child difficult to control.

DuFour is charged with second-degree assault on a child. She is currently in jailed with bail set at $250,000.
