This astonishing picture shows how sunlight reflected off the sea looked for a minute as if a UFO was coming in to land in the harbour.

A newsagent in the picturesque Cornish village of Polperro joked that he feared for a minute an alien such as E.T. was descending when he saw the strong blue shaft of light on the harbour.

William Fathers, of Polperro News, tweeted this stunning picture of the natural phenomenon from his shop's webcam with the caption 'Aliens are beaming down to Polperro Harbour'.

Tourist favourite: Cornwall's picture-perfect Polperro harbour is an unusual spot for an alien invasion

The trick of the light was caught on camera last Friday as Cornwall, like much of the country, basked in an extended Indian summer.

Sunshine reflected off the sea created a shimmering blue beam shining straight onto the pretty harbour.

Mr Fathers, 46, who set up the camera to capture the sights in the popular tourist village, said: 'It happens at this time of year when the sun gets low in the sky.

'The light bounces off the sea and hits the camera.  It's just one of those things but it does look weird.'

Phone home: The blue shaft of light looked as if it could have come straight from the 1982 hit film E.T.
