Prosecutors seeking to increase the bail amount for a retired Wisconsin cop accused of murdering his wife and her sister asserted the ALS sufferer plotted the murder for days.

Former Dane County sheriffs deputy Andrew Steele, 39, not only gunned down wife Ashlee and sister-in-law Kacee Tollesbol on August 22, but he went to great pains to ensure it was just the three of them home that day.

The judge agreed that the accusations warranted a higher bail and agreed to increase it from $1million to $2million Thursday, just as Steele pleaded not guilty to two-counts of first degree homicide.

In cold blood? Andrew Steele appeared stoic in a Wisconsin courtroom Thursday, where his bail was increased from $1million to $2million after prosecutors argued he'd planned the murder of his wife and sister-in-law days in advance

However, the Wisconsin State Journal reports that Judge Nicholas McNamara did not rule on whether Steele could visit his children aged 10 and 13.

Prosecutors on Friday charged a former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease with shooting his wife and sister-in-law to death earlier this month.

The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses.  

Former Dane County Sheriff's Deputy Andrew Steele, 39, faces two counts of first-degree intentional homicide in the death of his wife, Ashlee Steele, and his sister-in-law, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. 

He would get two mandatory life sentences if he is convicted. 

A judge on Thursday ordered a former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy to stand trial in the shooting deaths of his wife and sister-in-law.

Police found the bodies of Andrew Steele's wife, Ashlee Steele, and his sister-in-law, Kacee Tollefsbol, at the Steeles' home in Fitchburg, a Madison suburb, on August 22.

Tollefsbol told police before she died that her brother-in-law had shot her, according to court documents. Prosecutors charged Andrew Steele last week with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide.

'A reasonable person would conclude a crime was committed and the defendant committed it,' Dane County Circuit Judge Steven Ebert said at a brief preliminary hearing Thursday.

The only witness who testified was Matthew Wiza, a Fitchburg detective who was the first officer to reach the Steele home.

He told Assistant District Attorney Andrea Raymond that when he responded to a call of a gunshot victim in the Steele's basement shortly before 1pm, he found a haze of smoke in the backyard and blood on the patio. He said he heard a woman crying out that she was dying and found Tollefsbol, 38, covered in blood in a basement rec room.

He immediately asked her who had shot her and she said it was her brother-in-law. She was unable to answer any further questions, Wiza said, because 'her health was declining.' He later learned that she had been shot in the torso, he said.

Court documents indicate Tollefsbol had called 911 and told a dispatcher that her brother-in-law had shot her.

Supporters: Andrew Steele's law enforcement colleagues have made videos showing them taking the ice bucket challenge in his honor

No good deed: Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account 

Financial success: Mrs Steele and the deputy's friends were able to collect more than $20,000 towards his care through the ALS initiative 

Wiza said he later learned that a SWAT team discovered Ashlee Steele, 39, shot in the head in the master bedroom and found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room.

Andrew Steele, 39, looked on silently from the defense table, his ankles and hands shackled, as defense attorney Jessa Nicholson asked Wiza whether he saw any signs of a struggle in the house. He said he couldn't answer that because he was inside for only about four minutes before he carried Tollefsbol out to a waiting firefighter.

The motive for the slayings remains a mystery. Court documents are silent on the subject and Nicholson told reporters after the hearing that no motive has emerged.

Steele resigned from the Dane County Sheriff's Department in June after he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, which attacks nerve cells and can lead to paralysis and death. The average life expectancy is two to five years after diagnosis.

Nicholson said she plans to explore the effect the disease has had on Steele. According to the ALS Association, sufferers can sometimes experience problems with thinking and behavior. She said she would also determine whether Tollefsbol actually implicated him.

Ashlee Steele was leading a fundraising drive for her husband when she was killed.

Steele was ordered held on $1million bail and barred from contacting his family
