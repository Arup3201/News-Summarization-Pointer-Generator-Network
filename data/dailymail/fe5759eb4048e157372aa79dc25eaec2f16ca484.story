Rewriting the medical books: Rose Bingham, with her husband Garry, who is still fighting her illness

Rose Bingham was given just six months to live after being diagnosed with cancer - but four years later she's still going strong after her nine tumours disappeared.

Rose, of Stockport, Cheshire, was with husband Garry visiting their eldest son Jack, 24, in the U.S., when she was struck down with agonising head pains.

She was given just six months to live after scans found nine tumours on her brain, but after treatment - including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and Herceptin - they almost miraculously disappeared and Rose has enjoyed four years her family feared she'd never see.

Rose, 55, who had a five hour brain operation in December - yet was out of hospital two days later - said: 'This all started four years ago with breast cancer that spread into my brain, but I had no idea I had it in the first place.

'My advice to anyone who gets the diagnosis is don't give up and don't give in to it - you must not knuckle under, you've got to fight it.

'I call my cancer Fred - he was an obnoxious character from my past.

'When I was diagnosed and given six months my husband Garry burst into tears - I said "what are you crying about? It's not you that has got it".'

'I know I have a terminal condition and one day I will go, but I will fight it all the way.

'I could never just curl up. I've still done stuff with my kids and have had birthdays, Christmases and Easters with my family.

'I've lived to see my eldest son Jack get married and have had a fantastic holiday over in the U.S. only last year.

'When I was first ill, I told Jack I wanted him to get his degree - I didn't want him squawking his eyes out at my bedside.

'He was in the second year of his 
degree at the University of South Carolina and when he got his degree, I
 flew over on my own for his graduation.

'That was a great tonic for me and made me so proud, as did our youngest Connor, 19, passing his exams.'

Her husband Garry, 55, a barber,  said: 'It's been an emotional rollercoaster.

'Rose
 is a medical miracle and when she was first diagnosed she was so 
strong. The original diagnosis was six months and Rose wanted all the 
treatments.

'When they showed us the scan picture that July, I thought it 
was for someone else.

Rose was given just six months to live after scans found nine tumours on her brain, but after treatment - including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and Herceptin - they almost miraculously disappeared

'The initial scans showed nine tumours on her brain and then there were none. It was almost a miracle.

'The doctor asked if he could use the scans from Rose's brain as the maker of the drug were interested in what had happened as the lesions had "all but gone".'

'She was so incredibly brave flying over to the U.S. on her own to see Jack's graduation as I was unable to make the trip with her.

Her consultant oncologist at The Christie Hospital in Manchester, Dr Abbas Chittalia, believes that Rose is an incredible person and an inspiration.

Happy times: Mrs Bingham with her son Jack and husband Garry

Dr Chittalia said: 'When I met her for the first time over four years ago, I never thought she would be alive and so well without any neurological deficit four years on from her diagnosis of having multiple brain metastases from her breast cancer.

'I first saw Rose in January 2010 when she had been transferred over from the USA with multiple brain tumours.

'We found she also had multiple bone 
lesions and a tumour in her breast. The breast cancer was the primary 
source and it had spread to her brain.'

Since her diagnosis Rose has had various 
treatments, including radiotherapy, surgery to relieve pressure in her 
brain, surgery to remove her brain tumour, surgery to her breast and 
chemotherapy.

Dr Chittalia added: 'There has been good news and bad news throughout the years, but all along Rose has dealt with the situations with a smiling face and tremendous courage.

'She has always been very positive and has accepted all the various treatment recommended to her during this time with great courage and determination to do well.

'I remember clearly her original diagnostic brain scan showed at least nine cancerous deposits in her brain and following a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy with targeted agents, these completely disappeared on a follow up scan six months later. This was incredible to see and an encouraging sign.

'I wish Rose all the best for the future and hope she has many more years to live. Her case can be an inspiration to others.'
