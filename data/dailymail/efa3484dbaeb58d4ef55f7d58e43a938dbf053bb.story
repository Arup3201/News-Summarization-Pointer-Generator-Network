His baseball cap pulled down low, and wearing trainers with a puffa jacket, the Duke of Cambridge could easily have been mistaken for any other mature student as he rushed to make his train.

Sprinting through the station carrying his books in a rucksack, Prince William had to dash to catch the 16.45 service from Cambridge, where he is undertaking a 10-week bespoke course in agricultural management.

The royal was clearly eager to make it back to London to celebrate his wife's 32nd birthday at their home in Kensington Palace.

Rush: William only needed his sporty trainers for his dash through the station, after catching a lift from his chauffeur-driven Range Rover for the mile-long journey from university

But while many students and commuters would have had to sprint the entire way to the station, Prince William was able to catch a lift from his chauffeur-driven Range Rover for the mile-long journey.

And another vehicle was no doubt waiting to pick him up from Kings Cross on his arrival back in London.

He was back at home, where his wife had spent much of her birthday with five-month-old son Prince George, by the early evening.

Although details of how the couple were planning to mark the Duchess's special day, it is believed they celebrated with a simple family meal.

'The Duchess spent the day privately and the Duke was in Cambridge, so it was all very low key,' a Royal aide told The Telegraph. 

Prince William's more casual attire of a black bodywarmer and beige trousers was a far cry from the smart tailored suit and tie he sported on Monday for his first day at Cambridge University.

In his navy suit, Prince William cut a stylish figure as he took a tour around the campus prior to starting his course at St John's College, Cambridge - which will prepare him for when he 
inherits the Duchy of Cornwall, one of the biggest private estates in 
the country, from his father, the Prince of Wales.

The course is run by Cambridge 
Programme for Sustainability Leadership, an institution within the 
universityâ€™s School of Technology and has Prince Charles as its patron.

Although she will spend most of her time looking after Prince George while her husband completes his course, she is expected to carry out a handful of engagements and public appearances.

She will also no doubt be getting ready for the couple's forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand in April.

Prince George will accompany the Duke and Duchess on their trip, and the couple are expected to be joined by her mother Carole Middleton who will help them to look after the baby.
