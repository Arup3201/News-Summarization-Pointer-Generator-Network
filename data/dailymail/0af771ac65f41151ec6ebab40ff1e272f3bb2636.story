In the dock: George Huguely V arrives for the final day of his trial, hours before being found guilty of second-degree murder

A former University of Virginia lacrosse player was today found guilty of killing his girlfriend in a drunken argument.

George Huguely V was acquitted of first-degree murder, but found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Yeardley Love.

The jury recommended that the 24-year-old be sentenced to 26 years in prison, but he will not be formally sentenced until April.

Huguely is believed to have killed Ms Love in aÂ  jealous rage fuelled by her relationship with a North Carolina lacrosse player.

The verdict came after nine hours of deliberation, and while it fell short of the most serious charge it was nonetheless more serious than the manslaughter charge which some analysts predicted would be the eventual verdict.

Huguely, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, did not visibly react to the verdict, and there was no overt sign of emotion in the courtroom, which included families of the victim and the defendant.

Jurors who convicted Huguely immediately began hearing testimony in the sentencing phase, which included a tearful response from Ms Love's mother, Sharon Love.

She described the death of her daughter as 'unbearable', and added: 'Every year that goes by I'd like to know what she'd be doing now.'

Love's sister, Lexie, 28, described the absence of her kid sister.

'A song will come on the radio and I'll just burst out in tears,' she said, sobbing. Her sister's death, she said, 'left a large hole and nothing will fill it.'

'No person is the sum of the worst decision he ever made,' one of Huguely's defence attorneys told jurors before they began deliberating his punishment.

The jury of seven men and five women had to decide whether Huguely battered Ms Love to death in a jealous outburst or if his intent to talk with her spiraled out of control, leaving her bleeding and dying in her bedroom.

The jury heard from nearly 60 witnesses over nine days to determine what happened to Ms Love on the night of May 2, 2010.

That night, the women's lacrosse player was found face down on her pillow. Her right eye was swollen and bruised, she had marks on her chest that suggested she was grabbed and had injuries around her jaw and inside her mouth and neck.

Final day: Huguely is escorted into the Charlottesville courthouse ahead of the final verdict being delivered

Jurors
heard several potentially lethal consequences of such injuries. A 
coroner concluded the young woman from suburban Baltimore died of blunt 
force trauma.

In a 
police interrogation video viewed by jurors, Huguely said he went to Ms 
Love's apartment to talk about their sputtering, two-year relationship 
and she 'freaked out' when he broke into her room.

Their
encounter quickly turned physical, with Huguely admitting he may have 
shaken her but insisting he didn't grab her neck or punch her. He also 
claimed she repeatedly banged her head on the bedroom wall.

A medical expert for the defence testified that Ms Love likely smothered, her face buried in her own blood-dampened pillow.

Huguely's defence team has also 
suggested her death was the result of drinking and a prescription drug 
she took for attention-deficit disorder. A coroner said both substances 
were in her body but not in potentially lethal doses.

Guilty: Sentencing arguments began immediately after a verdict was reached following nine hours's deliberation

The prosecution painted a much more sinister scenario.

Huguely went to her apartment less 
than one week after he sent her a threatening email about her 
relationship with a North Carolina lacrosse player.

In the email, Huguely wrote that when he found out about the relationship, 'I should have killed you.'

In his closing arguments, defence 
attorney Francis Lawrence described Huguely as hulking, hard-drinking 
jock but no killer. He acknowledged Huguely had an unintended, 
accidental role in Ms Love's death, arguing for a finding of involuntary
manslaughter and a 10-year prison term.

Last week it was revealed Huguely 
wrote a letter to Ms Love shortly before she died saying that he could 
not control his behaviour and apologising for choking her.

During
closing arguments in the murder trial, a prosecutor said investigators 
found the letter from when they arrived at the scene where she was found
dead.

'I cannot 
control the way I behave,' Huguely, 24, was quoted by prosecutor Dave 
Chapman as saying in the letter written in February 2010. 'Alcohol is 
ruining my life.'

In closing arguments, Mr Lawrence said the prosecution team has been 
'over-zealous' in charging Huguely with first-degree murder.

'Where's the intent to kill?' Mr Lawrence asked jurors.

He said Huguely's reaction 
to police, who arrested and interrogated him the morning following Miss 
Love's death, showed that Huguely was 'a young man who has no clue' that
she had died.

He described the student as a 'stupid drunk' who lived in a 'lacrosse ghetto' which led to a lack of perspective.

On Friday, the jury heard that Huguely and Ms Love were holding hands in a bar just 24 hours before she died.

Huguely's aunt and godmother, Alina 
Massaro, testified that the pair were holding hands the night of 
Saturday, May 1, roughly 24 hours before Huguely confronted Ms Love.

The court were played a video recording of the hand-holding which was taken from a bar surveillance tape.

On trial: Mr Huguely acted strangely on the night of the killing, the court has heard

The day before, the 24-year-old was 
accused of lying about visiting his friends on the night she died. 
Former teammate Ken Clausen testified on Wednesday, the day the 
prosecution rested and defence began.

The defence began its presentation 
with a medical expert who said he believed Ms Love was asphyxiated from 
lying face down in a damp, bloody pillow. The testimony did not state 
how she came to be in that position.

While
Huguely acknowledged in a police interrogation that his final 
encounter with Ms Love turned physical, he said he did not believe her 
injuries were serious.

Most of the prosecution witnesses on Wednesday were former lacrosse players, many of whom knew Ms Love.

The
day before her body was found, Huguely was seen drunk during an 
end-of-season father-son golf tournament and dinner, his teammates said,
describing his slurred speech and public urination.

Later that night, he and other friends went to Huguely's apartment for beers and to watch TV.

About
20 minutes before midnight, they decided to go to a nearby store to 
pick up some more beer while Huguely remained in the apartment, the 
teammates said. They came back with the beer 15 or 20 minutes later, and
Huguely was not in the apartment but soon returned.

He
told his friends he had gone to visit two other teammates in his 
apartment building. One of the teammates, however, had stayed in his own
apartment and was not in Huguely's building.

Asked about Huguely's demeanour, the witness said: 'He had this blank stare on his face.' Mr Clausen said he repeatedly asked Huguely what was bothering him, but 'got no response'.

He said of Huguely's mood after he returned from the beer run, 'There was no doubt in my mind there was a change in his demeanour.'
