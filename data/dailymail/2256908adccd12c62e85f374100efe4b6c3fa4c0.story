The University of Virginia fraternity hit with allegations of gang rape in a Rolling Stone article will not be kicked off campus following a police investigation which turned up no evidence of the alleged sexual assault.

Phi Kappa Psi was suspended in November, after Rolling Stone published a story featuring a UVA junior named 'Jackie' who claimed to have been brutally gang-raped by a group of men at the fraternity during her freshman year.

All fraternities and sororities at the Charlottesville, Virginia campus were temporarily suspended in the wake of the controversial article, which provoked protests on campus over the school's relaxed prosecution of sexual assault reports.

They're back: University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan has decided to let the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity remain on campus, after a police investigation yielded no evidence that a gang-rape happened at the house, as described in a November Rolling Stone article.

However, the article later came into question when the Washington Post highlighted several discrepancies in the story - throwing doubt on whether the incident described by Jackie happened at Phi Psi, was orchestrated by a brother or even happened at all.

UVA President Teresa A Sullivan decided to allow end the fraternity's suspension after local police failed to find 'any substantive basis' to Jackie's claims.

'We welcome Phi Kappa Psi, and we look forward to working with all fraternities and sororities in enhancing and promoting a safe environment for all,' Sullivan said in a statement issued Monday, which marks the first day of the spring semester.

Phi Psi's chapter President Stephen Scipione praised Sullivan's decision to re-open his fraternity.

'We are pleased that the University and the Charlottesville Police Department have cleared our fraternity of any involvement in this case,' Scipione said in a statement. 'In today’s 24-hour news cycle, we all have a tendency to rush to judgment without having all of the facts in front of us. As a result, our fraternity was vandalized, our members ostracized based on false information.'

In the wake of the article, the fraternity was tagged with graffiti that read 'suspend us!' and 'UVA center for rape studies' and was the scene of mass protests. 

Charlottesville Police Captain Gary Pleasants said his department is still investigating, but since they found no evidence of the assault, there was 'no reason to keep them suspended'.

Phi Psi's reinstatement on campus means they will be able to hold parties at the house, and start new member recruitment - known as Rush - this semester.

The fraternity's triumphant return to campus means they will no doubt be holding a party at the house this weekend, the first following winter break.

If so, they will be holding the party under news rules instituted by the school in the aftermath of the scandal.

These new rules include the banning of kegs and pre-made mixes of liquor at parties, and now requires beer to be served in closed can and wine to be poured in the open by a sober brother.

Reviled: The Phi Kappa Psi house was tagged with graffiti in the aftermath of the article. The fraternity's president issued a statement on Monday saying: 'In today’s 24-hour news cycle, we all have a tendency to rush to judgment without having all of the facts in front of us. As a result, our fraternity was vandalized, our members ostracized based on false information' 

The campus's fraternities wrote the new guidelines themselves to help prevent the spread of date rape drugs, and Phi Psi was reportedly the first house to agree to the manifesto.

Scipiano also said that he and the rest of the fraternity have undergone a sexual assault awareness program.

'We believe that in the midst of this ordeal, there is an opportunity for good,' Scipione said. 'This has prompted us to take a closer look at ourselves and what role organizations like ours may play in ensuring student safety.'

The Rolling Stone article details the national issue of campus sexual assault, using UVA as a case study for how schools try to push these reports under the rug in order to protect the university's reputation. 

The story starts with Jackie's horrifying account of a date with a Phi Psi brother gone wrong.

In the story, she claims she met a Phi Psi brother named Drew through her job at the campus pool and that he invited her to dinner and a date night at his fraternity just a few weeks after she started her freshman year in 2012.

After dinner they returned to the frat, where he invited her upstairs for some time alone. But the date turned into a nightmare when she was smuggled into a dark room where a group of seven men proceed to rape her one by one for hours in what appears to have been an initiation ritual.

Jackie said she passed out in the midst of the painful and traumatizing experience, and when she woke up she was alone and fled the house.

She later met up with three friends - called Cindy, Andy and Randall in the article - who coldly weighed the pros and cons of reporting the incident to police,  fearing how it would impact their chances of getting into a frat and their social lives.

Their side of the story: Three of the friends who comforted Jackie following the attack later came forward to identify themselves and reveal the fact that the Rolling Stone reporter never asked to interview them. They disputed several claims in the article

Just days after the story was published, Jackie's story began to unravel as the Washington Post found discrepancies in the article and her friends came forward with a very different account of events.

Among the many issues revealed by the Post, was the fact that Jackie wasn't entirely sure what fraternity the rape happened at.

She says found out the name of the house a year after the rape, when one of her friends pointed it out.

The trio that helped Jackie the night of the rape, publicly came forward to identify themselves using their real names and said that the Rolling Stone reporter never even asked to interview them.

If she had, they would have told her that Jackie's account of what happened at the fraternity was not the same as that reported in the article.

'Silence is violence': The article incited wide-spread protesting on campus over the school's relaxed prosecution of sexual assault reports 

Though they believe something happened to her that night, the fact that her story has changed has led them to doubt her.

Also, they said that on the night in question they insisted she talk to police and report the crime, but that she  refused and instead went to bed.

In December, the fraternity issued a response to the story, saying no member of the fraternity was working at the pool at the time and that there was no event scheduled for the weekend Jackie says the incident happened.

The avalanche of evidence calling into question Jackie' story caused Rolling Stone to apologize for the article.

In their first apology, they said that their trust in Jackie had been misplaced, though they later edited that line out.

The magazine has enlisted the help of the Columbia Journalism School to investigate their reporting process and what caused it to fail. (The school also named the story the worst piece of journalism for 2014.)
