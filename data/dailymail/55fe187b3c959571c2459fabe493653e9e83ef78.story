Antonello Tonna (pictured) has witnessed two tragedies after being aboard the Costa Fascinosa yesterday and the Costa Concordia in 2012

The pianist on board a cruise ship from which three passengers were killed in the Tunisian museum massacre was also aboard the Costa Concordia when it capsized, it has emerged.

In a remarkable coincidence, Antonello Tonna told today how he was on board the Costa Fascinosa when the shootout began at the Bardo Museum in Tunis yesterday.

The anguished musician, who did not disembark the ship, had only just returned to playing at sea following the trauma of the Concordia disaster in January 2012.

He described it as a 'tragic destiny' that he had been involved in the two harrowing incidents, in the space of just three years.

According to The Telegraph, he told Italian media: 'Mine is a tragic destiny - to be called by journalists once again about a drama that I have been involved in.

'I'm reliving the same powerful emotions that I went through during the sinking of the Concordia.' 

Mr Tonna told how he had returned to sea earlier this year after a three-year hiatus.

'After three years I decided to go back because I missed the ships,' he told RAI state television.  

Mr Tonna also told how he had stayed on the ship when it docked in Tunis, but later heard about the attack through a text message from his wife. 

He said he subsequently saw teary, shaken passengers returning to their cabins. Three passengers from the ship were killed - four Italians and a Russian - and eight others were injured.

'There was a great deal of apprehension, with passengers glued to their mobiles trying to get information,' he said.

'We are hugging each other more. I have to say, there is a lot, a lot of solidarity.'

The Fascinosa left port Thursday morning, bound for Spain's Palma de Mallorca, where passengers would be allowed to disembark and go home on Costa's tab if they want to cut short the cruise. 

A window of the Bardo Museum is filled with bullet holes after the shootout which claimed the lives of 23 people. Mr Tonna learned of the massacre after receiving a text message from his wife

Costa said it was suspending Tunisian stops for future Costa cruises.

'The security of our guests and crew is Costa Crociere's priority and a necessary condition for calm and pleasant vacations,' it said. 

Earlier, Michael Thamm, the group's chief executive of Costa Group, released a statement condemning the 'barbaric and horrific terror attack'.

He said: 'With great sadness we regret to report that three passengers of the Costa Fascinosa are amongst the victims of this barbaric and horrific terror attack in Tunis, and a further eight guests are injured.

'In addition, two remain unaccounted for. We strongly condemn the attack on democratic Tunisia.

'Our deepest sympathy and our condolences go to the victims and their families. We share their sorrow. Our team in Tunis is currently taking care of the companions of the victims and the eight guests who are being treated in hospitals.' 

Another Mediterranean-based cruise ship, MSC Splendida, also had passengers in town at the time of the attack. British solicitor Sally Adey, one of the ship's passengers, was killed in the massacre.

The MSC ship also left Tunis early Thursday, bound for Barcelona. 

Thirty-two people were killed when the Costa Concordia ran aground in the seas near the Tuscan island of Giglio in 2012.

It was the worst maritime disaster since the Second World War. The Concordia's captain was recently convicted of manslaughter and causing the wreck.
