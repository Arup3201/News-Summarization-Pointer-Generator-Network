Victim: Postal worker Tyson Barnette was shot while on duty in Maryland on Saturday evening

The US Postal Inspection Service is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information in connection with Barnette's death.

NBC reported that other postal workers had visited the scene and were extremely concerned about their own safety. One emotional carrier told the station: 'That could have been me.'

One local resident told the Washington Post that he saw the postal carrier just before the shooting occurred.

The man said that he returned home just as the worker was placing mail into his letter box, but it wasn't his usual postman and he didn't respond when the resident called out to him.Â

Within minutes of entering his house 
the man told the Post he heard two or three gunshots. When he looked out
 of his window he said he saw a postal service vehicle, but no sign of 
the worker.

There have been complaints in recent months that postal carriers are having to deliver mail later in the day, sometimes after it is dark.

Local residents have noted Saturday's postal delivery was much later than usual.

Barnette had been a letter carrier for six years and had been on this particular Landover route three times in the last month.

Authorities are asking any witnesses to call Prince George's County police with information.

Reward: The US Postal Inspection Service is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information in connection with Barnette's death

According to the USPS, any person who kills or attempts to kill any federal officer or employee while they are on official duties could face the death penalty.

The National Association of Letter Carriers has released a statement saying the incident shows the need for safety considerations in how and when mail is delivered.

Shootings of mail carriers in uniform and on their rounds are extremely unusual.
