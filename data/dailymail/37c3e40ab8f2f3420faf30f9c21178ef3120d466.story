She's better known for her love of the quiet life and fresh, wholesome looks but it seems that Dutch model, Doutzen Kroes, has a naughty side.

The Victoria's Secret Angel appears in a racy Mario Testino shoot in this month's Brazilian Vogue in which she wears little more than jewellery and swimwear.

In one shot, just a pair of white Água de Coco bikini briefs and a striking Bulgari diamond cuff stand between the model and total nudity.

Kroes' sultry shoot isn't the only part of Brazilian Vogue's June edition to raise eyebrows. The issue also features Brazilian bombshell, Gisele Bündchen, in her first shoot since giving birth to her second child last year.

Like Kroes, the Gisele photographs, which are also used on the cover, were shot by fashion's most famous photographer, Mario Testino.

'I always love to work with Gisele and 
when Vogue asked me to photograph her for this special issue I could not
 refuse,' Testino said.

The shoot featuring Doutzen is in this month's issue of Vogue Brasil

'I have always found she has an incredible body and perfect 
proportions – she looked amazing just two months after giving birth to 
Vivian.

'In Brazil body image is very relevant since  people have a big 
concern with the shape, whether being dressed or naked; it's such a part
 of the culture – like in Rio where the beach meets the city and people 
go to the beach after work and on weekends.'

Other stars to appear in Brazilian Vogue's 'body' issue include Pamela Anderson, Brazilian actors Débora Nascimento and José Loreto, international football player Alexandre Pato, and models Andrej Pejic, Casey Legler and Joan Smalls.

All are seen in editorial shoots created by Testino which explore the theme of the human body and image.

Testino, who has previously worked with French, Spanish and German Vogue magazines on special themed issues, has continued his tradition of collaborating with artists for Brazilian Vogue.

Cecile Brown, Nate Lowman, Jenny Saville and Mickalene Thomas all collaborated with Testino to create a unique set of images focused on the theme of the human body.
