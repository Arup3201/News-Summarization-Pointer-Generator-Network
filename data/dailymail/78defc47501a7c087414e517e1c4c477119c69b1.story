With just a carefully placed stick or trophy to hide their modesty, this team of hockey players have bared almost all, in the name of charity.

The Hampstead and Westminster Hockey Club men's first team came up with the idea to raise money for a cancer charity in honour of a teammate who is being treated for the disease.

Martin Scanlon was diagnosed with non-hodgkin's lymphoma two years ago.

His brother Ian still plays for the club having been the first team goalkeeper.

Sixteen of the first team, which includes one Olympian, took part in the shoot.

Mr October, first team captain Toby Roche, 26, told MailOnline when tasked with raising £1,500 for their club, the team wanted to do something 'fun, a bit different'.

The hockey club is trying to raise £150,000 to get one of their pitches re-laid. 

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer that develops in the lymph nodes and tissues of the lymphatic system.

The lymphatic system is a network of vessels that runs throughout the body carrying the fluid containing white blood cells.

Lymph nodes respond to infections by releasing white blood cells into the blood stream to fight it off.

When someone has lymphoma, lots of abnormal cells are produced within a particular lymph node or tissue.

The most common sign of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is swelling of the glands, or lymph nodes in the neck, chest, groin or armpit.

The swelling often causes a lump that is generally painless but persistent, lasting for up to six weeks.

Some non-Hodgkin lymphomas develop in other tissues around the body, that the lymphatic system extends to, including the kidney, lungs and gut.

Other symptoms include:

As such each team has been given the task of trying to raise £1,500 a year to help fund the project.

Sponsored pub crawls and raffles have been held.

But when the men's first team came to brainstorming their fundraising ideas, they wanted to do something a bit different.

'We wanted to do something funny,' said Mr Roche. 'Our old goalkeeper, Ian, who still plays for the club, inspired the idea.

'His brother was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma about two years ago, he used to play for the club as well. 

'We wanted to do something to raise money for a charity as well as the club.'

He explained half the proceeds will be donated to Mr Scanlon's charity of choice, the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research Foundation. 

Mr Roche, a solicitor, said having resigned themselves to shooting the calendar on their iPhones the team were saved by one of the women's first team players.

Helen Cathcart, a professional photographer , stepped in to organise the team.

'We were very fortunate that Helen, rather bravely, agreed to shoot it for us,' Mr Roche told MailOnline.

'And the end result is all the better for it, it has far exceeded our expectations.

'Normally she shoots cook books, so it was a bit of a change for her. We're really grateful.'

So far the team have managed to sell 200 of the 350 they had printed by Geoff Neal Litho, who offered to print the calendar at a discounted price to help raise maximum funds for the charity. 

To see the full calendar, get your hands on a copy for just £10. 

They are available from Paddington Sports Club, where the club is based, or via the team's eBay page here.

Half of the proceeds from the calendars will go to the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research Foundation, while the other half will help fund the hockey club's £150,000 project to re-lay one of the pitches. Mr February, Richard Hildreth who played for Canada in this year's Commonwealth Games 2014
