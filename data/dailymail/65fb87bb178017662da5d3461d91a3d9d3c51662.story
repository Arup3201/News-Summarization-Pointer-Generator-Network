The people who have already started queuing for Apple’s iPhone 6 face a wait of two weeks after reports claim the device will go on sale a fortnight from today. 

Although Apple is set to unveil its iPhone 6 at an event next Tuesday, it is unlikely to go on sale until the following week.

Traditionally, Apple announces a product on a Tuesday before releasing it ten days later, on a Friday, which this year falls on 19 September.

Apple is expected to unveil a new range of products (iWatch and iPhone 6 concept images are pictured) at an event in California on Tuesday. The devices are then set to go on sale ten days later on 19 September. This would match Apple’s release schedule seen from previous years

Since 2012, Apple has scheduled an iPhone event midweek in September, released the latest software update the following Wednesday, and then released the devices the Friday after.

People began queuing outside the Fifth Avenue Apple Store on Wednesday, hoping to be the first to get their hands on whatever new devices Apple unveils.

Camping outside stores has become a tradition, but this year the camping has started more than two weeks early.

In addition to new iPhones, Apple could launch new versions of its iPads along with new iPhones and the iWatch next week.

In terms of the iPhone 6, Apple is expected to unveil larger 4.7- and 5.5-inch models, both with fingerprint scanners and 128GB storage options.

This would be a move away from Apple’s traditional 4-inch models.

KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iWatch will also be unveiled, with 8GB of internal storage, and 512 MB of RAM.

The smartwatch may come in male and female versions, with flexible screen sizes of 1.3- and 1.5-inches.

Elsewhere, it will use technology known as NFC to communicate - allowing it to be used as a payment method card as well as for monitoring health.

And it could feature wireless charging capabilities.

The same report predicts that the iPad Air 2 will be announced on the same day as the iPhone 6 rather than in a separate event in October.

Experts claim the new iPad 2 Air will feature a fingerprint sensor and a new thinner design.
