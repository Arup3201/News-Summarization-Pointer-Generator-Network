Australian roundabouts are among the most dangerous in the Western world because they are designed for capacity and not safety, a new study has shown.

The report, which was released by Austroads last week, found that the design of Australian roundabouts encouraged drivers to speed through intersections and to ‘look but not see’ other motorists.

Australian roundabouts are built according to a tangential design, which means that the driver has very good visibility as they approach the roundabout and is less likely to slow down, or check the roundabout closely as they approach the intersection.

The Britannia roundabout in Adelaide (pictured) is one of the nation's most dangerous, between 2009 and 2013 there were 291 crashes at the roundabout

The researchers suggested that the ideal speed at which motorists should travel through a roundabout is 25 km/hr, but with the current Australian tangential design, many motorists do not slow down as they approach the roundabout and regularly go through at speeds in excess of 40 km/hr.

Australian roundabouts differ from those built in the UK and Europe, which employ a ‘radial’ design that deliberately aims to reduce visibility.

These roundabouts are designed to force drivers to reduce their speed as they approach the roundabout, giving them enough time to scan for other motorists and cyclists before entering the roundabout.

Cyclists were particularly at risk on Australian roundabouts. In Victoria, one in 10 accidents involving a bike occurs at a roundabout, reported the study.

This figure gets worse in cities, with almost half of all roundabout crashes in inner city Melbourne between 2004 and 2009 involving cyclists.

European roundabouts employ a radial design (left) rather than the tangential design (right) used on Australian roundabouts. The tangential design allows for too much visibility and encourages drivers to speed through the roundabout

In Queensland, 15 percent of all bicycle crashes at intersections occurred at roundabouts, despite roundabouts accounting for only four percent of intersections.

One of Australia's worst roundabouts was the Britannia roundabout in Adelaide. Between 2009 and 2013 there were 291 crashes at that roundabout, though the average has dropped since September 2013 when the roundabout was upgraded.

The research also found that attempts to improve the safety of cyclists might actually be making conditions more dangerous for them.

Bicycle lanes, for instance, may make a roundabout feel bike-friendly, but actually increase the risk of crashes by positioning bicyclists away from the middle of lanes where motorists look.

Bike lanes also make cyclists more vulnerable to sideswipe accidents and those caused when drivers of parked cars open their car doors in front of cyclists without looking.
