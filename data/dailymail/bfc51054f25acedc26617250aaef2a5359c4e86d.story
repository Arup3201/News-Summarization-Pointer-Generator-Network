Kentucky school children hate new Michelle Obama-backed USDA school lunch regulations.

Despite its name, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act may be leaving some public school children wanting for more as choose to starve rather than eat the vegetables and ‘brown wheat’ required by the law.

‘They say it tastes like vomit,’ Harlan County, Kentucky school board member Myra Mosley.

At least someone's happy: The First Lady has long pushed for healthier school lunches but some Kentucky school children and their parents are pushing back

Hers was among a chorus of angry voices at a recent Harlan County school district board meeting, where many parents said their kids are coming home hungry, reports the HarlanDaily.com.

‘It’s strange and different for them, so they don’t like it,’ said Jack Miniard, director of school and community nutrition, who was on hand to explain that the new lunches were required by law.

But Mosley held her ground and repeated that the milk ‘tastes like vomit.’

The new regulations have a calorie cap and require that school meals include only one portion of meat or protein. They also stipulate that milk be either skim or one percent fat and that bread be ‘brown wheat.’

In an effort to curb obesity, 
carbohydrates like French fries may only be served in three-fourths of a
cup portions and kids in elementary school—where the complaints mostly 
seem to originate—may only be served a total of 650 calories per meal.

Forcing a smile? A Harlan County school student poses with his lunch. Many parents in the Kentucky County say their children wont' eat skim milk and wheat bread--food items they're not accustomed to

Fair? The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 established new standards for all foods sold in schools with an emphasis on more veggies and fewer calories. Students with extra money may buy extra lunches, however

The restrictions and lack of enthusiasm over unlimited fruits and vegetables have some parents concerned their children won’t get enough to eat.

‘Kids can’t learn when they’re hungry,’ many parents moaned.

The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act only applies to the lunch-per-day provided by the school. An additional lunch may be purchased by students who have the cash.

Which leaves students in Kentucky, a state among the nation’s fattest and poorest, in a pickle.

Backed into a legal corner by the First Lady’s law and students and parents more accustomed to calorie dense meals from a box than they are to unlimited fruit, Miniard could only play the role of soothsayer.

He assured Mosley and the other parents that a taste test of the milk would be conducted.

Angry: In Kentucky, one of America's fattest and poorest states, a law that allows only those with extra cash to eat more than 650 calories per meal has come with predictable outrage
