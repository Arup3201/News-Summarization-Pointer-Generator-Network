A council has been criticised for launching a 'bizarre' appeal for the return of a Nazi flag that went missing from one of its offices.

The flag was given to Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after it was taken from an Italian warship sunk by the town's adopted warship HMS Tumult in 1943.

It was stored in the town hall until two years ago, when it was moved to nearby Oldbury. But yesterday it emerged the flag has gone missing.

Councillors asked the public to help find it so they can put it on display. Labour councillor Ann Shackleton said it was 'a symbol of local people's pride in their community'.

'I'm very keen for this historic memorabilia to return to Cradley Heath because it belongs to the people of Rowley Regis,' she said.

'It was largely paid for by public subscription and remains a symbol of local people's pride in their community and their civic identity.

'The flag was just a keepsake do with history and we think it's the sort of thing that gives a clear message when children are learning about the war.

'It's just added interest if we could have displayed it.'

Labour councillor John Tipper said he feared the war memorabilia had been lost or stolen.

He added: 'This Nazi flag is an important part of our history because it was captured from an Italian warship in World War II by sailors from Rowley Regis' adopted warship.

'We want what is left of our hoard back from Oldbury Council House.

'I never thought I'd ever have to say this but to whoever has our Nazi flag can we please can we have it back.'

But residents have criticised their appeal saying it is a 'disgrace' and 'a bizarre use of their time'. 

Bob Gibbins, 44, a local butcher, said: 'Have they not nothing better to do than launch an appeal to find a piece of Nazi memorabilia.

'They are hardly going to run it up the town hall flag pole when they get it back are they, considering what it represents.

'It's just a bit of a bizarre use of their time really.'

Mum-of-three Valerie Loxley, 57, added: 'I understand its part of our history but I can't see it being that important to the people of Rowley Regis.

'If I made an appeal to my neighbours for the return of my Adolf Hitler related items I would probably be chased out of the town.'

Paul Walker, 34, added: 'There's a war memorial which has gone missing from my kids school but you don't see them appealing to find that.

'Instead they are focusing on the safe return of an item which represents the most evil political party in world history that exterminated six million jews. Its a disgrace really.'

Sandwell Council leader Darren Cooper overruled his colleagues and said the flag would never be put on display if it is found because of what it stands for.
