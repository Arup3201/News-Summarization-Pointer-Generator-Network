Britain will salute its Olympic heroes with a victory parade which will see up to a million sports fans cheering Team GB through the streets of London.

The breath-taking achievements of around 800 Olympians and Paralympians will be recognised with a spectacular carnival of floats riding down The Mall to Buckingham Palace.

Medal winners such as Sir Chris Hoy, Bradley Wiggins, Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis will have the opportunity to show off their silverware at the parade on Monday September 10, after which both Team GB and Paralympics GB will be received by David Cameron.

The route: The September 10 parade will start at Mansion House and finish in front of Buckingham Palace

Olympic heroes: Chris Hoy, seen left winning the men's keirin, and Jessica Ennis, right, who won gold in the Heptathlon, will be among the 800 athletes taking part in the victory parade

Huge numbers of families and school children are expected, making the crowd larger than those for the victory parades for the Ashes win in 2005 and 2003 Rugby World Cup.

The latter saw 750,000 take to the streets to pay tribute to their heroes.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt has promised ‘a fantastic finale’ and ‘one of the biggest parties London has ever seen’.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Team GB ambassadors are due to begin a tour of Malaysia, Singapore and the Solomon Islands the same day, but are understood to be hoping officials can rearrange their plans so they can take part.

Princess Anne, president of the British Olympic Association, will also attend the event, which will mark Britain’s greatest gold medal tally since 1908.

Andy Hunt, Team GB Chef de Mission and
Chief Executive of the British Olympic Association, said: ‘The Our 
Greatest Team Parade provides a fantastic opportunity for the nation to 
recognise and celebrate the special achievements of the outstanding 
group of athletes who represented Great Britain and Northern Ireland at 
the 2012 Games.

‘Importantly,
it also gives the members of Team GB a chance to show their 
appreciation and gratitude for the truly inspirational support they 
received from the Great British public throughout the London 2012 
Games.’

Tim Hollingsworth, Chief Executive of
the British Paralympic Association, said: ‘With ParalympicsGB athletes 
about to embark on the most important sporting event of their lives, and
ten days of intense competition about to start, we know we have to 
focus on what is still to come at the 2012 Paralympic Games.

will be celebrated in London after the greatest medal haul
in more than 100 years

Huge numbers of vistiors mean the crowds are likely to dwarf former victory parades for the Ashes win in 2005 and 2003 rugby World Cup victory

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge hope they can rearrange their schedules so they can join in the extravaganza

The route will snake through the streets of London, with a colourful parade of 21 floats marking the huge achievements of team GB

'But it’s also right we look ahead to 
what we hope will be a fantastic outcome for our team and in particular 
the performances and medals won that will excite and inspire the nation 
once again.

'So I am 
delighted that we can be part of the Parade and make sure the 
achievements of our athletes are both celebrated and recognised in this 
way.’

The route 
travelled by the parade of 21 floats, which will be organised by sport, 
is today confirmed, with athletes setting out from Mansion House in the 
City at 1:30pm.

They will travel along Queen Victoria Street and Cannon Street, passing by St Paul’s Cathedral, continuing along Fleet Street, past Aldwych and into The Strand, before reaching Trafalgar Square.

A big screen at the base of Nelson’s 
Column along with live commentary will allow spectators to cheer on the 
athletes as the parade makes its way past Trafalgar Square.

After passing Trafalgar Square the 
athletes will go through Admiralty Arch into The Mall, travelling down 
to the Queen Victoria Memorial.

The final stretch will be ticketed and is
reserved for 14,000 volunteers, members of the blue light services, 
military personnel, Team GB and Paralympics GB coaches and support 
staff, friends and family of the athletes involved as well as 
schoolchildren from every London borough.

Britain was beaten only by China and the US coming third in the medal table with 48 medals including 22 gold.

The Queen will host a reception for Olympians and Paralympians later in the year.

Celebrations: Huge numbers of families and school children are likely to ensure the parade to honour the likes of Jessica Ennis and Laura Trott will dwarf former victory parades for the Ashes win in 2005 and 2003 rugby World Cup victory

Sites: The parade will also pass iconic sites such as St Paul's Cathedral and Trafalgar Square
