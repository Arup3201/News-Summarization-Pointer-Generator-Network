One of the world's rarest collection of gemstones has gone on public display for the first time at Sotheby's auction house in New York.

The dazzling hoard of sapphires, emeralds, diamonds and pearls, are just a slice of what Paris-based jeweler, Alexandre Reza, has accrued since the end of World War II, when his fascination with gems began.

Some of the creations on show in the new exhibit include a ring featuring a giant 52.31 carat sapphire and 101 white diamonds and a pearl pendant the size of an eyeball.

Dazzling: The jewelry of Parisian jeweler Alexandre Reza has gone on public display for the first time at Sotheby's auction house in New York - here is a ring featuring a giant sapphire and 101 diamonds

An exact replica of the pearl and diamond necklace Francis I - the King of France from 1515 to 1547- gave to his wife, makes for another must-see piece.

Mr Reza, now in his nineties, is lauded as the 'greatest gem collector of modern times.'

Indeed, Sotheby's notes that his stash surpasses 'even those of legendary royal collections.'

He followed in his jeweler father's footsteps and began his career as a 
diamond expert in the mid-forties.

Showstopper: Another equally impressive pieces on show is this giant pearl pendant, complete with white and yellow diamonds

Early on, he traveled the world, sourcing and supplying gems to brands such as Boucheron, Bulgari, Cartier, Chaumet, Gerard, Harry Winston, and Van Cleef & Arpels.

By
the 1960s he was designing his own jewelry and in 1981 he founded his eponymous boutique on the Place Vendome in Paris.

After achieving rapid success he established retail
presence in Geneva, Cannes and Monaco.

His designs were popular among the rich and famous, with clients including 'Rat Pack' entertainer Sammy Davis Jr.,
American socialite Florence Gould and the Sultan of Brunei.

Many of his customers were also Middle Easterners, who craved yellow-gold and colorful gems, rather than the platinum and white diamonds offered at Cartier and Boucheron.

One of the more bizarre requests he received was to turn two giant emeralds into wheel-shaped earrings for a maharajah’s elephant.

However, Mr Reza took the decision to close shop in 2008 after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

But thankfully his son, Oliver, who led followed a successful career in international banking in New York came to rescue.

In
June 2012, he returned home and re-opened the Alexandre Reza salon. Recently he completed own jewelry pieces with an eye towards expanding his father's collection.

He said of the new exhibit: 'My family and I

creations with jewelry collectors around the world.

'This exhibition will showcase my father’s legacy as a jeweler, and the work that we create today in his honor.'

The Extraordinary Jewelry of Alexandre Reza will be open to the public for viewing from November 1 to 13 at Sotheby’s New York.

It will then travel on to London, Doha and Beijing in 2014.
