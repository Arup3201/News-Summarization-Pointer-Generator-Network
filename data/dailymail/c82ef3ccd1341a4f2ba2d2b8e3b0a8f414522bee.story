If you've ever queued in a shop in the UK, waiting to be guided to an available cashier, chances are you've heard his measured tones.

In a long and slow-moving queue, you may even have wondered about the person behind the voice directing the people in front of you to 'cashier number three, please' - was he real, or perhaps computer-generated?

Today, the man behind the voice is revealed as Terry Green, 53, a father-of-one businessman from Stratford-upon-Avon.

Wait your turn: Terry Green, 53, is the man whose voice controls millions of shoppers in queues across the UK

Every month, an estimated 30m queuing customers are guided by his voice in 8,000 UK outlets including M&S, Waitrose, Boots and the Post Office.  Others stores you will hear Mr Green's voice in are Lloyds TSB, TK Maxx, and Matalan.

And Mr Green is not only the voice of the automated queuing system, but he invented it.

The company he co-founded, Qmatic, devised what they called 'customer flow management' in the 1980s to help queues become faster and fairer.

The system is now used to control roughly a quarter of the world's population - 1.75bn people - in shops around the globe, although Mr Green's voice is only used in the UK.

Despite his global success Mr Green, who sold his stake in the company but remains involved as a consultant, has never yet been unmasked.

But he is still often recognIsed by his voice alone.

He said: 'My claim to fame is a famous voice - and a less-famous face. 

Post offices across the country use Terry Green's voice to keep the queues fairer and moving faster

'If you wander up and down most High Streets in this country you’ll hear me saying "Cashier number three please" and it does make your voice a bit recognisable.

'If I’m queuing in a shop talking on the phone and a person hears my voice they’ll say "Gosh, these two voices sound the same".

'The other day I was doing work for an NHS hospital and people were coming up to me and saying 'so you are the cashier number three person. Say it. Say it.'

Divorced Mr Green co-founded Qmatic in 1981 to promote ‘customer flow management’ and counted the Post Office as the first organisation to use the linear queue system.

The system has a button so retailers can choose between a male or a female voice, and there are several female voices to choose from, most of them done by professional voiceover artists.

The business now has a global turnover of £50m and employs some 300 people, while Mr Green is still fascinated by customer service and wrote a book about it, You're Next, published in 2011.

Mr Green says the customer service in queues is vital - and businesses who want to survive should take note

He said: 'You get very focused on how long queues take and how the service is being distributed so I do like to share my thoughts with shop staff.

'If I am in a shop and I get receive good service, I will congratulate the staff but if I receive bad service, I will definitely tell someone about it.

'I had to do it the other day when a friend was shopping for a sofa: the customer service was not great so in the end we bought it online.'

Mr Green says despite the boom in online sales, keeping customers happy in stores is still vital.

He said: 'We know that the worst thing about face-to-face experiences is badly organised queues.

'If the organisations don’t invest in making the experience as slick as it would be online, they are going to lose business, it’s as simple as that.'

His company is now developing a mobile app for shoppers showing the lengths of queues in shops in a given area.

Terry Green's is not the only voice we know even if we don't realise it.

Travellers on the London Underground will recognise that of Emma Clarke, 42, who tells passengers to 'mind the gap' and warns them which stations are coming up next.

Her voice has been used on the Tube since 1999 but in 2007 her contract for future announcements was terminated by staff who felt she had criticised them in an interview.

A professional voiceover artist from Cheshire, Ms Clarke is also the voice of many car sat-navs.

Sara Mendes da Costa, 47, from Brighton, is the woman behind the Speaking Clock, the fourth holder of the position since the clock's inception in 1936.

She was awarded the job in 2007 after a competition was held to find a new modern voice for the clock.

Fans of the Lotto will recognise Alan Dedicoat's voice if not his face, as he is the man who announces the winning numbers.  With a catchphrase of 'And the bonus ball is...', Mr Dedicoat, 58, who lives in Harrow, worked his way up from regional radio and reads the news on Radio 2.

Meanwhile Peter Dickson's voice is heard in many sitting rooms on Saturday nights - the 56-year-old is the voice of the X Factor.  The Belfast-born radio presenter and voiceover artist has also voiced campaigns for British Gas, Downton Abbey and Heinz.
