Luis Suarez pounced on a Jamie Carragher header to snatch a draw for Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. 

John Terry opened the scoring before being carried off having collided with Suarez in the first half, but Chelsea succumbed to pressure in the 73rd minute.

John Terry's return to Chelsea's starting line-up was cut short by a nasty-looking injury in the first half against Liverpool - just 15 minutes after he bagged a goal.

Terry, back in the side for the first time having served a four-match ban for racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, was carried off while holding his face and screaming in agony after Liverpool striker Luis Suarez slipped and landed awkwardly on the 31-year-old's knee.

The European champions have an anxious wait ahead of them, as Terry will undergo an MRI scan at 9am tomorrow morning on the injured right knee.

Suarez took to Twitter to offer his condolences to Terry, posting on his official Twitter page: 'A shame we could't get the three points.

Game over: John Terry's return was cut short

As it happened: Luis Suarez lost control, slipped and landed with all his weight on Terry's knee

'Glad to to help the team with another goal... Hugs to Terry, I hope it's nothing serious.'

Gary Cahill hastily stepped in for 
Terry in the 37th minute, who seemed to know immediately that he would 
be unable to continue, putting up a hand to indicate the need for a 
substitution.

Little more than fifteen minutes earlier, Terry was enjoying a dream return to the fray.

The Chelsea captain powered home a header to put his side a goal up at Stamford Bridge.

Juan Mata found the unmarked former England international in the box from a corner, who obliged by glancing his effort past a stranded Brad Jones.

Terry's subsequent injury was clearly an accident, and no blame could be attributed to Suarez. The Uruguayan bore down on Terry with the ball at his feet while being pursued by Ramires.

Terry stood square on as Suarez - who slipped, or was perhaps nudged from behind by Ramires - fell, landing with all his weight on the centre back's outstretched right leg.

After five minutes of on-pitch treatment, Terry was carried off and straight down the tunnel past manager Roberto Di Matteo, who attempted to console him.

Suarez looked concerned as he stood over his injured opponent. But the striker showed little mercy later in the game as he latched onto a Jamie Carragher header to nod home from close range.

Di Matteo revealed the club did not know the extent of Terry's knee injury with the captain set for a scan tomorrow.

The Italian told Sky Sports 1: 'He has a problem with his knee and will have an MRI scan tomorrow.

'At the moment we can't say, we'll have to wait for the scan which will tell us the extent of the injury. He is certainly a player that is influential for us. We will miss him.'

He added: 'When a player reacts like that, it's a concern. He's in pain now. He'll go to hospital tomorrow for a scan.

'We hope it's not a serious injury, but we'll see.'

Terry was consoled by Di Matteo before disappearing down the tunnel to receive treatment before returning home.

'I was concerned about his well-being,' the Italian added.

'We just got him back into the team after the ban. It was great seeing him out there.'

'He started the game very well, showing the qualities he has, and the experience and influence.

'It's a real shame he had to come off as he was having a very good game.'

To make matters worse, Ashley Cole was already out with a hamstring problem and David Luiz missed Liverpool's visit with tonsillitis. 

Di Matteo is hoping to dodge a defensive crisis, and said he was 'hopeful' the pair would be fit in time for Saturday's trip to West Brom.

Concern: The Uruguayan attempted to comfort Terry after the incident

'At centre-back we have cover,' said 
Di Matteo, who was slightly less optimistic about Frank Lampard's 
return, who missed today's game with a calf problem.

Di Matteo added: 'Lamps, it might be a bit too early, but he won't be long after that.'

The skipper left the Bridge at around 6:30pm. His right leg was tightly bound as he departed on crutches.

Terry was back in the Chelsea 
starting line-up for the first time after serving his four-match ban for
racially abusing Anton Ferdinand last season.

Di Matteo decided not to use Terry in
the Champions League last week, as he felt he was not ready to make his
return after spending a lengthy period on the sidelines.

Yet Terry could be facing far longer 
on the sidelines, especially if the injury to the knee he had surgery on
in February turns out to be as grave as it looked.

Di Matteo stated ahead of the match that even Terry, who remains a fans' favourite at Stamford Bridge, was not immune from his rotation policy.

The Italian manager said: 'He's certainly a fantastic player for us and he will continue to be so and continue to be our captain and our leader when he plays.'

'I don't think anybody's guaranteed a starting place.'

'They all have to work and be fighting for their place in the team.'

He added: 'We've got a lot of competition in the team and they're all internationals.

'We've got an England international playing or a Brazil international, or a Serbia international.

'So, all of them are international players that have a lot of quality and they are at a very high level.'
