Arsene Wenger has admitted he regrets allowing Theo Walcott to join up with the England squad in November as the ‘edgy’ forward prepares to make a belated first Arsenal start in almost a year.

It remains to be seen how effective the 25-year-old can be against Southampton, with Wenger revealing that Walcott is nervous about tackling after so long out.

He has not started a fixture since January 3 when he ruptured the cruciate ligament in his left knee against Tottenham.

His November comeback spanned only two games from the bench before he then injured his groin in shooting practice with England.

Cautious Wenger has left Walcott on the bench for three straight games and accepts he made a mistake in letting Walcott go on international duty so soon after his return.

The Arsenal boss said: ‘I regret it, yes. At the time it looked like a good opportunity for him to get a game because England played a friendly against Scotland and I thought maybe a game or one half of a game would help him get through that and play at a high-level competition. 

'But he came back injured. He overloaded his groin in training. It can happen.’
