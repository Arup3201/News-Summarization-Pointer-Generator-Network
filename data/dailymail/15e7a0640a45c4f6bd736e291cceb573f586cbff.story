Rangers were sentenced to death after HMRC torpedoed Charles Green’s hopes of preserving the club in its current form via a CVA.

The Revenue, who are owed over £21million by the beleaguered Ibrox club, rendered Thursday’s scheduled creditors’ meeting a formality by declaring they would oppose the proposal — thus ensuring the liquidation of Rangers Football Club plc, incorporated in 1899.

Green had hoped his £8.5m offer would be enough to win the day, but with 38 per cent of the current £55m debt belonging to HMRC and 75-per-cent creditor approval required, their compliance was central to his plans.

Blow: The CVA deal will not be allowed

The Yorkshireman, who last night launched a broadside at HMRC for ‘misleading’ him, will now complete his purchase of Rangers’ assets — Ibrox Stadium, Murray Park and the Albion Car Park — for £5.5m at the end of this week.

And the former Sheffield United chief executive will attempt to persuade the SPL to admit a newco Rangers into the top flight next season in the coming month.

The new incarnation would require eight of the 12 club representatives to approve the move — a vote is likely to take place at the AGM on July 16 — but, if the newco entry is blocked, the new Rangers are likely to apply to join the Scottish Third Division — with Dundee, who were runners-up in the First Division, replacing them in the top flight.

Regardless of what division they are playing in next season, the newco will be unable to compete in European football for three seasons. It will also require the approval of the SFA to compete in any league.

Bad news: Charles Green confirmed the blow

And in another potential flashpoint for the club, Green and administrator Duff & Phelps are adamant the contracts of players will automatically transfer over to the new company — an issue hotly disputed by the players’ union, PFA Scotland, and a number of leading agents.

On a day of extraordinary drama, which came 120 days after the club entered administration, Green reacted furiously to the mid-morning news that the Revenue would not back his plan.

‘It’s massively disappointing and I think to some extent we have been misled by HMRC,’ he said.

‘Duff & Phelps have consistently said to me that they were in dialogue with HMRC and that they hadn’t rejected the CVA route.

‘Irrespective of what I was being told by HMRC, my own advisors at Deloitte have been in dialogue with them, too.

‘To see them today saying this is a policy decision leaves me speechless.‘If that’s the case, is that a policy that was invented this week?

Takeover turmoil: Rangers future hangs in the balance

‘If not, why weren’t we told that in February or March? We could have gone into a newco then and saved a huge amount of money and time.

‘It would also have removed the false hope from Rangers fans.’

According to a statement from HMRC, ‘liquidation provides the best opportunity to protect taxpayers, by allowing the potential investigation and pursuit of possible claims against those responsible for the company’s financial affairs in recent years’.

HMRC also stressed their decision did not undermine the sale of the club but would allow Rangers a ‘fresh start’.

However, Green insists any investigation into former directors should not necessarily have precluded HMRC from agreeing to a CVA.

He added: ‘I’m not a lawyer but, if a former director has done something wrong, he should be pursued.

What next? Rangers face liquidation

‘I don’t believe turning down a CVA is a price worth paying to pursue previous directors.’

Green promised to finally name his investors following the creditors’ meeting, saying: ‘We’ll reveal who is on the board, what the names of the directors are and all of the things the fans, the SFA and the SPL are looking to see.

‘The consortium’s capabilities are not affected at all.’

Green was given ‘preferred-bidder’ status by Duff & Phelps last month ahead of rival bidders like the Blue Knights, a consortium including former Rangers’ director Paul Murray and businessman Brian Kennedy.

Joint administrator Paul Clark last night closed the door on any rival bid for the club’s assets being considered, claiming the agreement with Green’s Sevco consortium was ‘binding’.

Men for the job: Paul Clarke and David Whitehouse from Duff & Phelps administrators

‘We made it clear to the Blue Knights and others some weeks ago when we got to the stage of agreeing Charles Green’s offer, what the position was,’ Clark explained.

‘I very much expect that sale to be concluded later this week but not until after the CVA is rejected on Thursday.’

Clark predicted that the existing company would be wound up in the autumn. ‘To be honest, I don’t know exactly how quickly, but I would suspect it would take six to 10 weeks,’ he said.

‘One of the issues is there’s some ongoing litigation in relation to Collyer Bristow including a hearing in October and what we wouldn’t want to do is have a situation where that is harmed in any way. So we need to think that through.’

Duff & Phelps, administrators:

We have been informed by HMRC they will not support the proposal for a Company Voluntary Arrangement at the meeting of creditors on Thursday, June 14.

As a result of this decision, the Sale and Purchase Agreement in place with the consortium led by Charles Green will take effect and Rangers Football Club will continue within a new company structure.

The reasons HMRC have given to us for their decision to vote against the proposal are as follows. HMRC has cited its general policy of not agreeing to a CVA where there is strong evidence of non-compliance by a company with its tax liabilities.

HMRC had agreed to consider a CVA proposal along with all other options in the case of Rangers but having taken into consideration the extent of funds which will be made available to creditors through the CVA option, they have decided that it is not acceptable given The Rangers Football Club plc's level of indebtedness to HMRC.

It has also been made clear to us that other offers tendered for the Club, which took the form of a CVA, would have been treated in the same way and that the rejection is not a reflection of the Green consortium bid.

HMRC has taken the view that the public interest will be better served with the liquidation of The Rangers Football Club plc as a corporate entity. The Club will continue to operate as it has always done but within a new company structure.

HMRC consider that the decision will enable a liquidator to instigate a wider investigation into all of the financial affairs and management of the Club in recent years and to bring to task those they believe are responsible for its collapse.

Furthermore, HMRC believes there will be an enhanced recovery of funds for creditors by pursuing those individuals who they believe are responsible.

The consequence of the rejection of a CVA outcome is that sanctions will be applied to the Club by UEFA and that the Club will not be able to participate in Europe for three years and the new company will need the consent of the other SPL clubs to the transfer of the share in the SPL, in order for Rangers to continue playing in the SPL.

As we have always stated, administrators have a primary objective to ensure the survival of the company and in this case, this would have been achieved through a CVA. 

It was with HMRC's approval, that a proposal was placed before creditors for consideration. However, it is the commercial view that the level offered within the CVA was not enough to merit departure from their normal policy of seeking a detailed investigation via a liquidator.

However, we have been left in no doubt by HMRC the fundamental reason for the rejection of the CVA proposal is the historical non-compliance with tax liabilities by the former owners and directors of the Club.

As we have stated previously, there is a binding contract between ourselves as administrators and Charles Green, who is leading a consortium to acquire the Club.

The creditors' and shareholders' meetings will take place at Ibrox on Thursday but the results of those meetings will now be entirely academic given HMRC's decision.

As soon as the CVA proposal is formally rejected, Mr Green's consortium will move towards completion of an acquisition of the business and assets of The Rangers Football Club plc. That transaction will be completed within a few days. The sum payable to creditors will be £5.5 million, most of which has already been paid over to us by the Green consortium.

Over the coming months, we as administrators will continue to finalise the administration of the Club and we will work in conjunction with BDO who will undertake the liquidation process.

We would like to thank the staff and supporters at Rangers for their great determination and professionalism during a very difficult period for the Club. While the Club will continue to face difficulties in the short term, it will survive and continue to play at Ibrox.

HMRC: A liquidation provides the best opportunity to protect taxpayers, by allowing the potential investigation and pursuit of possible claims against those responsible for the company's financial affairs in recent years.

A CVA would restrict the scope of such action. Moreover the liquidation route does not prejudice the proposed sale of the club.

This sale can take place either through a CVA or a liquidation.

So the sale is not being undermined, it simply takes a different route.

Liquidation will enable a sale of the football assets to be made to a new company, thereby ensuring that football will continue at Ibrox.

It also means that the new company will be free from claims or litigation in a way which would not be achievable with a CVA. Rangers can make a fresh start.
