Photos from an unreleased and potentially massive collection of stolen celebrity nudes can be bought online for $350.

More evidence is emerging that this summer's celebrity nude leaks were only a peek at how many photos and videos were compromised through security flaws in Apple's iCloud.

Business Insider's James Cook found that the internet users eagerly trading in stolen celebrity nudes have moved on from forums like Reddit and AnonIB to a German site called Volafile and that sellers are offering entire unseen collections for hundreds.

More victims: Sellers claiming to have more stolen photos from celebrities such as Daisy Lowe (left) and Annalynne McCord (right) have moved them online through encrypted email or file-sharing sites like Volafile

Market: Users on the 'realtime filesharing' site Volafile use the chat function to discuss the upload of stolen photos and videos and uploaders solicit donations in bitcoin

Timing: A scrolling list of files available to view in each room is refreshed whenever a new file is uploaded and shows the amount of time left before a file disappears from the server

A 'realtime filesharing' site with a chat function, Volafile allows users to post images and other files, some of it pornographic in nature, that disappear after a short period of time.

That's where Cook found many photos were being traded between users, with leaks of celebrities like actresses Annalynne McCord and Abigail Spencer being shared, to the praise of other users.

One account tried to take the moral high ground, asking that users should go donate to Unicef's campaign against Ebola if they appreciated his leak of a hacked video of actress Abigail Spencer. 

Dealer: Business Insider posed as a buyer and contacted Sets Ahoy through encrypted email, who offered sets of nudes for around $350

Still unreleased: Sets Ahoy peddled photos that have not been released publicly on sites like AnonIB and Reddit

Other users in Volafile rooms made requests for underage photos of celebrities like U.S. Olympian McKayla Maroney, who would have been under 18 in many of the shared photos allegedly of her.

Even Reddit, which was criticized for tolerating the hacked photos for a time in spite of otherwise strict anti-doxing policies, had cracked down on leaks like Maroney's.

Nils Kuhnhenn, creator of Volafil, deleted the chatrooms after being contacted by Business Insider and rooted out rooms uploaders had planned to fall back on after the original ones were closed. He said he deletes rooms violating the site's terms of use as they are discovered.

But outside of Volafile, bigger stashes of hacked photos that have not yet leaked are being sold by dealers in exchange for bitcoins.

One dealer named Sets Ahoy, who sells collections of photos by the dozen, was contacted through his encrypted email address and offered to sell sets of celebrities such as British model Daisy Lowe.

'Today it's been 1 btc,' read the email sent to Business Insider, who posed as a buyer. 'I do offer discounts for multiple sets though.'

The cryptocurrency is currently trading just under $350 for one bitcoin.

Sets Ahoy verified his samples of the photos through a Dropbox link, then deleted them. 

It is not certain how the cloud-based file storage site will respond to the use of their site.

What this does show is that, in spite of this summer's massive leak and subsequent responses from Apple and Google over cloud-computing's security flaws, the community sharing celebrity nudes was only temporarily disrupted.

Altogether, dealers and other collectors may be holding onto thousands of photos of celebrities, and simply staying quiet. 

That's in addition to the unknown number of photos of non-celebrities whose photos hackers have quietly been stealing for years, as Wired pointed out.
