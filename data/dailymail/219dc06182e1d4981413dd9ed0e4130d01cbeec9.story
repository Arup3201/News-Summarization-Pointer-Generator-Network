A group of teachers in Sarasota, Florida, put their markers and lesson plans aside on Friday to learn how to take down an armed gunman in hopes of preventing another tragic school shooting.

Under the tutelage of weapons instructor Michael Magowan, local public school teachers practiced drills on disarming an attacker holding a rubber gun to their head during a free class at the Veritas Training Academy.   

During the class, teachers set behind desks, clutching fake handguns and intently watched Magowan as he demonstrated how to properly handle a firearm.

Drastic response: The December 14 tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 first-graders and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, has sparked a national debate about whether to arm teachers

Switching from theory to practice, the educators later took part in shooting exercises at a firing range on the premises of the learning center, firing at a target depicting a burly, moustachioed assailant holding a little boy hostage. 

This is only the latest example of what has become a national trend of educators flocking to gun ranges and weapons training classes to learn how to defend their students in the aftermath of the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre that has left 20 elementary school children and six adults dead.

In Texas, two concealed handgun classes graduated 460 teachers, while 1,100 signed up for a three-day gun course in Ohio. In Utah last month, 200 teachers volunteered for six hours of firearms training.

Uptick: There has been an influx of teachers flocking to gun ranges and applying for conceal gun permits nationwide

Gun ranges throughout the country have been reporting an increase in teachers coming in for weapons training, but not everyone is on board with this response to the Sandy hook tragedy, which is especially controversial in states like Florida where law prohibits teachers from carrying guns in school grounds, according to The Palm Beach Post.

Amid a contentious national debate about gun control and gun violence, images of educators learning to disarm gunmen and firing weapons have been met with both shock and words of praise.

Those who support the idea of weapons training for teachers believe that if another gunman 
targets a school he will face an armed response rather than classrooms 
full of defenseless staff and children.

‘I actually like the idea. I think it's better to be safe and cautious,' Chicago parent Jennifer Thompson told NECN.

However,  Mandy Koehl disagreed, saying, ‘I think putting guns that close to 
children presents a risk in itself, so I'm not sure it sends the right 
message,’

During the training session in Utah last month, primary school teacher Jessica Fiveash said: ‘If we have the ability to stop something, we should do it.’

The basic training by the Utah Shooting Sports Council emphasized how teachers should show their gun, as well as taking cover, before trying to shoot. The teachers applied for a concealed weapons permit, submitting fingerprints and a mugshot for a criminal background check.

In Ohio, a firearms group said it was
 launching a scheme in firearms training for 24 teachers and Arizona is 
proposing a change to the law to allow a teacher in each school to carry
 a gun. Some parents have questioned the cost of arming and training 
school staff and also whether it will keep anyone safe.

Opponents
 list potential dangers such as teachers being overpowered for their 
weapons or students getting them and shooting classmates, either 
accidentally or on purpose.

The moves to train teachers come after the National Rifle Association proposed placing an armed officer at each of the nation's schools, though some schools already have police officers. Parents and educators have questioned how safe the proposal would keep children and whether it would be economically feasible.

Around 200 teachers watched intently and made notes as Mr Aposhian demonstrated with a plastic gun during concealed-weapons training offered free in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre

Following the Connecticut tragedy, NRA's chief executive Wayne LaPierre famously claimed: 'The only 
way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.'

Larry
 Pratt, executive director advocacy group Gun Owners of America, also 
claimed that gun control supporters ‘have the blood of little children 
on their hands’ and the tragedy could have been prevented if the 
teachers were allowed to carry weapons.

Some educators say it is dangerous to allow guns on campus. Among the potential dangers they point to are teachers being overpowered for their weapons or students getting them and accidentally or purposely shooting classmates.

'It's a terrible idea,' said Carol Lear, a chief lawyer for the Utah Office of Education. 'It's a horrible, terrible, no-good, rotten idea.'

Kristen Rand, the legislative 
director for the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy 
organisation, said to believe that a 'teacher would be successful in 
stopping someone who has made the decision to engage in a shootout is 
just not rationale'.

'No teacher is ever going to be as effective as a trained law enforcement officer,' Ms Rand said.

Even trained police officers don't always hit their targets, and arming teachers could put innocent students at risk of crossfire, she said.

Gun-rights advocates say teachers can act more quickly than law enforcement in the critical first few minutes to protect children from the kind of deadly shooting that took place in Connecticut. They emphasized the importance of reacting appropriately under pressure.

Mr Aposhian says that a gun gives teachers another option if a shooter breaks into a classroom

The teachers listened intently to the lessons. Some claimed they do not see anything wrong with arming educators

'We're not suggesting that teachers 
roam the halls looking for an armed intruder', said Clark Aposhian, 
chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's biggest gun 
lobby.

'They should lock down the classroom. But a gun is one more option if the shooter breaks into a classroom.'

They cautioned teachers about the liability that comes with packing a gun in public.

'I wouldn't hesitate to shoot if the 
danger was immediate,' said Ms Fiveash, adding that her laser sight 
would make shooting in tight quarters safer.

English
 teacher Kevin Leatherbarrow said he often felt threatened while working
 at an inner-city school in Buffalo, New York, where he got a license to
 carry a pistol.

He moved less than a year ago to Utah, where he feels safer. But he said gun violence can break out anywhere.

Mr
 Leatherbarrow said he was highly trained in handling guns - and was 
taking criticism from parents who don't appreciate his views on school 
safety.

Mr Aposhian, who demonstrated personally using plastic weapons during the six hour session, said that having a gun was a 'responsibility'

'I'm in agreement not everybody should be carrying firearms in school. They're not trained. But for some parents to think we're cowboys, that frustrates me,' he said.'I wish parents would understand.'

In the U.S. the number of homicides at schools of children, ages 5-18, have been lower year-by-year in the 2000s than they were in the mid- to late-1990s, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics report on school crime released in 2012. 

At 32 deaths, the 2006-2007 school 
year was the only one that reached the levels from the 1990s. The manner
 of death was not listed.

Utah
 is among a few states that let people carry licensed concealed weapons 
into public schools without exception, the National Conference of State 
Legislatures says in a 2012 compendium of state gun laws.

Utah
 educators say they would ban guns if they could, but legislators left 
them with no choice. State law forbids schools, districts or college 
campuses from imposing their own gun restrictions.
