'Shooting spree': Hector Ceyala is accused of shooting three people dead in California

Hector Celaya, suspected ofÂ  fatally shooting three people and wounding his two daughters and one other child, has died of wounds sustained in a gunfight with police.

Celaya, 31, allegedly shot and
wounded his two daughters, aged five and eight, who were with him in a vehicle as he fled across California Indian reservation where he was caught at 2am, officials said.

It was unclear when the girls were shot.

A motive for the attacks was not immediately known.

Authorities
apprehended Ceyala about six hours after Tulare County sheriff's 
deputies were called at 8pm on Saturday, to a trailer on the Tule Indian
Reservation.

Inside the home, they found the body of a man and a woman; the body of another man was discovered in a nearby shed.

Deputies
also discovered a boy, believed to be about seven, wounded. He was 
taken to a hospital in Visalia, then on to a second hospital in Fresno, 
said Shelby Charley Jr., an engineer and supervisor with the Tule River 
Reservation Fire Department.

'This
is a once in a lifetime kind of deal,' Mr Charley said of the call. 
'It's one of those calls you could go your whole career and not walk 
into. This is one of those calls that will stick with you for the rest 
of your life.'

Police 
tracked Celaya's cellphone and pulled him over in a rural area outside 
the tiny community of Lindsay at 2 am, about 20 miles from the 
reservation.

Celaya fired his weapon, prompting deputies to return fire, sheriff's Sgt. Chris Douglass said.

She
did not say how many shots were fired but said Celaya fired his gun 
'multiple times'. Celaya was wounded during the exchange of gunfire and 
was being treated for life-threatening injuries, Douglass said.

Celaya also shot his daughters. One girl suffered life-threatening injuries while the other girl was less seriously hurt.

Celaya
is described by authorities as 'known to law enforcement, is known to 
use drugs,' though Douglass could not provide additional details.

The reservation where the initial shooting took place is about 50 miles north of Bakersfield.

Since the shootout more details have emerged about Celeya's background as the church bell that 
rings out to announce the deaths of tribal members on the Tule River 
Indian Reservation tolled four times Sunday.

The
remote reservation relies on the Eagle Mountain Casino for revenues. 
Each tribal member receives $500 a month, but Hunter said most of the 
profit is invested into educational programs for the children.

The
compound where the shooting took place is on a dirt road in a scenic 
canyon lined with oaks and sycamore trees. Herds of horses graze the 
hillsides, and modular houses sit on hilltops.

But tribal members said the former custodian at the 
reservation's casino had a troubled past.

'He 
had a real hard life,' said Rhoda Hunter, the tribal council secretary. 
'But all of us do, we all have a hard time. But we try not to let it get
the best of us.'

Hunter said that Celaya's 
mother was a friend of hers. Her name has not yet been released by 
authorities at the Tulare County sheriff's department, which is 
investigating the case.

The killings stunned the tightknit tribal community.

'We've had a lot of deaths here, but nothing like this. Not murder. No, not murder,' Hunter said.
