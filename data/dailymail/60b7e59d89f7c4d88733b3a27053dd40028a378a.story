Fernando Torres insists he is friends with Jose Mourinho and has no hard feelings about leaving Chelsea last summer because it was his decision to move on.

The Spaniard turned his temporary move to AC Milan into a permanent one last week before signing for his boyhood club Atletico Madrid on an 18-month loan deal.

Torres is pleased to be back at the club he left for Liverpool in 2007 but he has quashed suggestions that he was forced out of Stamford Bridge by Mourinho.

He said: 'The press will always try to make stories but the truth is Jose and I have a very good relationship. We shared a relationship of honesty and trust. I have nothing but respect for him and I am sure that he feels the same.

'There is no truth about him forcing me out of Chelsea. I wanted to play regularly and he was honest with me and told me he couldn't promise me that. If he is ever in Madrid I would buy him dinner, we are friends.'

Torres endured a largely difficult spell in west London, scoring just 45 goals in 172 appearances across four-and-a-half years after joining for a then-British record fee of £50million.

But despite his disappointing form, the 30-year-old is adamant that his time at Chelsea can be viewed as a success. 

He added: 'Chelsea is in the past for me now - I want to look forward - but of course I look at my time there has a good one. 

'How many players get to win the Champions League in their career? Even some of the best players in the world go throughout their career without winning it, memories like those can only be considered good ones.'
