A 33-year-old Australian man has plunged to his death in south-east France while attempting to parachute off a cliff.

Police said the man had thrown himself off the 2,600-metre peak of Brevent in the French Alps.

Rescue workers said he likely died on impact. He was found 'several hundred metres lower in a wooded area below the site,' they said.

Two hours later a French base jumper was also killed after hitting a rock face on his descent from Mont Granier in the neighbouring Isere region of southeastern France.

The man, aged 52, and described as 'extremely experienced', was found 200 metres below the ledge from which he had jumped.

'He managed get over the first rock face, but not the second,' one of the rescuers said.

Investigations have been launched into both accidents.

An investigation has been launched to determine the exact cause of the accident.

On August 6, two base-jumpers, one from Switzerland, the other from France, died in similar accidents in the Alps.

A base-jump is defined as a leap off a fixed high point -- the name being an acronym for Building, Antenna, Span (such as bridges) and Earth (natural settings).

Unlike skydiving which involves leaping from an aircraft, base jumpers take off with a parachute from a fixed point, usually a cliff or a bridge.

The sport carries high risks. A Norwegian study published in 2007 concluded that base-jumping is five to eight times more likely than skydiving to result in injury or death.
