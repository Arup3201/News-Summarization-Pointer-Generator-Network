Charged: Peggy Sue Thomas was accused of plotting with her then-boyfriend to kill a man named Russ Douglas in December 2003

A former Ms Washington and hairdresser who had been implicated in the 2003 death of a man found fatally shot in Washington state, has pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.

Island County authorities say Peggy Sue Thomas will spend four years in prison after she is sentenced in February after her charges were reduced to rendering criminal assistance.

Thomas, who was crowned Ms Washington in 2000 and has had a string of failed marriages since, had faced a first-degree murder charge until the plea deal that was struck on Thursday. 

She was accused of plotting with her then-boyfriend, James Huden, to kill a man named Russ Douglas, of Whidbey Island, who was found shot to death in a car on December 27, 2003.

Huden, who was arrested in Mexico in 2005, was convicted of first-degree murder last summer and sentenced to 80 years.

He could have been faced a much slimmer sentence if he had testified against Thomas, but he refused.

Her trial was due to begin next week.

A motive for the murder was never established, but reports suggested the duo had planned to kill Douglas out of revenge because they suspected him of abusing his wife and children.

Thomas knew Douglas' wife Brenna, who owned the salon where the former beauty queen worked.

'It was some weird karmic revenge thing.
I’m not sure if that was the motive or the only motive. There were a 
lot of theories about what the motives were,' prosecutor Greg Banks told The Seattle Times.

In addition, Banks said that a key prosecution witness was gravely ill.

Defense lawyer Craig Platt said Thomas maintains her innocence.

Platt told the Seattle Times: 'What she’s guilty of is getting in with the wrong guy. She's guilty of having poor taste in men.'

He added that the plea she entered on Thursday gives her much-needed relief from a case that has dogged her for nearly a decade.

After her 2000 pageant victory, Peggy Sue got married - a few times.

One of those nuptials was a short-lived marriage to Alaska oil tycoon Mark Allen.

Allen's horse Mine That Bird, won the Kentucky Derby in 2009 - the same year the couple divorced, according to a 2011 profile in Seattle Weekly.

Thomas was arrested in July 2011 on her houseboat, called Off the Hook, near Farmington, New Mexico.

But after posting $500,000 bail, Thomas made headlines for her post-jail travels.

She was allowed by a judge to take a two-week, five-state road trip so she can attend her half-sister's memorial service, go to the dentist and pick up winter clothes, after her release.

The trips took her to New Mexico, Utah and Nevada to take care of a few chores - preparing to sell a house and picking up her winter clothes, among other things.
