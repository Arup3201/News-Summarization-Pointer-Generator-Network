After almost a decade behind bars, 
Ryan Ferguson, the 29-year-old Missouri man released earlier this month 
for a murder he didn't commit, has been making up for lost time and 
enjoying many of the things denied him when he was locked away for all 
those years.

Ferguson impressed many with his articulate and thoughtful demeanor at a press 
conference just hours after his release on November 12, when he spoke of his desire to get 
back to the reality of life on the outside.

Recent photos posted on the Freed Ryan
 Ferguson Facebook page show he has taken his first steps to doing just 
that by enjoying simple pleasures such as playing basketball with 
friends and cocktails with his girlfriend, as well as sorting out 
practical necessities such as getting a driver's license.

One of the first things that Ferguson has done since his release is visit his grandparents in Florida, where he had spent many happy summers as a youngster. 

He
 had not seen them since Christmas 2003 and had feared he would never 
see them again until NBC's Dateline flew Ferguson and his mother to
 Florida for an emotional reunion.

While in Florida, Ferguson had his photo taken posing with a sign that read 'Freed Ryan.' This was highly symbolic to his supporters, many of whom had posted photos of themselves with signs calling for him to be freed while he was locked up.

Ferguson 
was just 19 when he was convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison 
for the brutal murder of Kent Heitholt, a local newspaper sports editor in
 Columbia, Missouri.

There 
was no physical evidence connecting Ferguson to the crime and the guilty
 verdict was based solely on two witnesses who later retracted their 
testimony.

At his press conference at the Tiger Hotel
 in Columbia, Ferguson spoke with remarkable composure as he acknowledged
 the efforts of his family, his attorney Kathleen Zellner and the army of people who had helped support him while he was locked away.

‘To get arrested and charged
 for a crime you didn’t commit is incredibly easy, and you lose your 
life very fast. But to get out of prison, it takes an army,’ he said.

Since his release, that army of supporters and admirers have raised over $65,000 for him via the Ryan Ferguson Fund campaign, which was launched a few days after his conviction was overturned.

The fund has received donations from more than 1,500 supporters, who have donated anything from $10-$1,000 individually.

'The fact of the matter is when he got out he had nothing,' Mike Rognlien, who has spearheaded the fund and Ferguson’s Facebook page, told The Maneater.

He decided to get involved after seeing coverage of Ferguson on 48 Hours and Dateline NBC.

Rognlien said: 'His financial life is basically that of a 19-year-old. When 
you’re in your 20s, that’s when you really start building your 
foundation. You buy an apartment. You buy furniture, a job, an income, 
and he didn’t have any of that.'

Rognlien
 said he hopes the money the fund raises will not force Ferguson to 
worry about finding a job right away, letting him focus on speaking out 
against his experience and wrongful conviction.

Ferguson has already vowed
 to use his freedom to campaign for justice for the victim’s family – 
even though they remain convinced of his guilt.

His
 family fought for years for Ferguson’s release. Now, he has revealed 
his intention to follow the campaigning example set by his father, Bill,
 in an interview with Keith Morrison for NBC’s Dateline.

Morrison told MailOnline: ‘Ryan is a remarkable young man. He has 
withstood the pressures of being in that environment for so many years 
and now he that he’s free he wants to get the Heitholt family a sense of
 justice.

'They still 
believe he’s guilty. He feels they’ve been lied to for years and he 
intends to campaign to have the investigation re-opened.'

Morrison has followed Ferguson’s case and his family’s fight, for 
several years and sat down with Ryan on the day he received word that 
this time, after a string of devastating disappointments, his freedom 
was ensured.

Recalling Ferguson's demeanor during 
the interview, which airs tonight at 8pm (7pm Central Time), Morrison
 said: ‘I was sitting down with Ryan at 11am that morning while he was 
still waiting for word. You could tell he wasn’t allowing himself to get
 excited but there was lightness about him that I hadn’t seen before. 

Ferguson
 was arrested in 2004 and convicted the following year after his friend 
Chuck Erikson came forward and confessed to the crime that took place in
 2001.

Kent Heitholt was 
viciously beaten and strangled in the car park behind his newspaper 
offices. Hair, fingerprints and bloody footprints had been found at the 
scene but there was not a shred of forensic evidence that pointed to 
either Erikson or Ferguson.

Ferguson is not angry with the former friend who drew him into a nightmare.

‘I think there were many years during which Ryan was angry at 
Chuck but then he realized Chuck was a confused drug addict and 
alcoholic, with a history of black outs,' said Morrison.

‘Chuck had problems and was used and manipulated.’

When asked of his feelings towards Erikson, Ferguson said: ‘I know he’s not a killer. He doesn’t belong in prison.’

They never lost hope: Ryan with his mother Leslie, left, father Bill, right and sister Kelly. His mother always believed her son would be returned to her and his father never stopped campaigning to make it happen

He
 also said that he respected Erikson and janitor Jerry Trump who 
identified Ferguson as having been at the scene of the crime for, 
‘having the courage to admit they lied.’

Speaking
 at the moment of his son’s release Bill Ferguson, who campaigned 
tirelessly on his behalf, said: ‘It’s the best feeling ever we just feel
 like we’ve rescued him from the pits of despair.’

According to Morrison it was a mantra of his father’s that helped Ferguson through some of his darkest days in prison.

He said: ‘His father told him, 
“Don’t feel sorry for yourself – be better, stronger and smarter and 
concentrate on what you can do to better yourself.”’

Ferguson used his time in prison to read and to try to educate other prisoners about nutrition and exercise while inside.

Morrison said: ‘Over the years of interviewing Ryan it’s really struck me what an articulate, thoughtful young man he is.

‘He told me, “Look I’m a young relatively articulate, white, well-educated guy, surrounded by an unusually committed determined family fighting for me.

‘Without
 that the chances of me getting released were slim to none. I recognize I
 was unlucky in the first place but I was enormously lucky after the 
fact.”’

The reality, 
according to Morrison who has investigated countless miscarriages of 
justice in his career, is, ‘Around the country, scattered in prisons all
 over America are people who do not have the chances Ryan had, people 
who will not get out.’

Now Ferguson, wants to spend some time with the girlfriend he met while in prison, his friends and his family.

Having learned how to live in jail he has admitted to being daunted by the prospect of learning to survive on the outside.

Morrison said: ‘Ryan said that the first morning he woke up as a free 
man he felt he’d slept in a bed that was too soft, on a pillow that 
wasn’t right. 

‘He went for a walk and felt like a tourist in his hometown because it has changed so much over the years.

‘He
 said he felt stressed for the first time in a long time and he 
recognizes that his job now is to work out how to live. He’s 29 and he 
has to work out what to do with his life now he’s been given it back.’
