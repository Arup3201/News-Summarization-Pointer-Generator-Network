South Dakota Senator Tim Johnson says he now supports legalizing gay marriage.

The Democrat released a statement today saying that after lengthy consideration, his views on the issue have changed.

He claims that such a law would apply only to governments and wouldn't require 'any religious denomination to alter any of its tenets.'

Support: South Dakota Senator Tim Johnson, pictured, says he now supports legalizing gay marriage

In 2005 and 2006, Johnson said he didn't support gay marriage but also didn't believe a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in the U.S. was needed.

Johnson recently announced that he wouldn't seek re-election next year.

'After lengthy consideration, my views have evolved sufficiently to support marriage equality legislation,' he said in the statement. 'This position doesn't require any 
religious denomination to alter any of its tenets; it simply forbids 
government from discrimination regarding who can marry whom.'

Remaining: His announcement leaves just three Senate Democrats who oppose gay marriage including Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, left, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, right

Opposing: Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, pictured, is also still opposing gay marriage

His announcement leaves just three 
Senate Democrats who oppose gay marriage: Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, 
Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.

Landrieu and Pryor are up for re-election next year in their Republican-leaning states.

Last week, Florida Senator Bill 
Nelson reversed his views on gay marriage, telling the Tampa Bay Times: 
'If we are endowed by our Creator with rights, then why shouldn’t those 
be attainable by Gays and Lesbians?'

Only three left: Last week, Florida Senator Bill Nelson, pictured, also reversed his views on the subject, claiming there was no reason to discriminate

He added: 'Simply put, if The Lord made homosexuals as well as heterosexuals, why should I discriminate against their civil marriage? I shouldn't, and I won't.

Nelson was re-elected in 2012, so won’t face another contest until 2018.

Senators Tom Carper (D-Del.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Bob Casey (D-Pa.) also changed their minds on the issue last week.
