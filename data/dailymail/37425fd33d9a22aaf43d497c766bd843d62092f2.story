An English woman who did not want her two children to live with her ex-husband in Australia has lost a fight from beyond the grave.

The woman had written a will and said 'under no circumstances' did she wish the youngsters - a girl aged eight and a boy aged seven - to return to their Australian father.

Her parents and her ex-husband, who is of Aboriginal descent, became embroiled in a family court fight over the children's futures after she died late in 2014.

A judge today ruled in favour of the woman's ex-husband following a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London.

Two children, aged eight and seven, have been ordered by a judge to return to Australia to live with their father. Their mother, now deceased, took them to England before her death. In her will she directed that under no circumstances should the children live in Australia with their father

Mr Justice Roderic Wood had been told that the pair had married a decade ago and lived in Darwin, Australia.

The woman was diagnosed with cancer, so travelled with her children from Australia to England for treatment two years ago. They were still married at the time.

Her then husband had agreed to the trip on the basis that she was going for treatment and the children would have a holiday.

But, without his knowledge, she had taken legal advice and decided that she wished to stay in England with the children.

She had signed a will and 'made it clear' that she wanted the children to 'have little or nothing to do with their father', Mr Justice Roderic Wood said.

The judge explained that she had written: 'Under no circumstances do I wish my children to be returned to their biological father in Australia as this would be extremely detrimental to their lives.'

The children were born and raised in Darwin, Australia. Their mother took the children to England for a temporary stay in 2012 and then refused to bring them back to Darwin

She said she wanted a friend or a relative in England to bring them up - and the judge said they were in England being cared for by their grandparents.

But the woman's ex-husband said they should be returned to Australia under the terms in an international convention.

He said they had been born in Australia, had grown up in Australia and their habitual residence was in Australia.

And he said he had never consented to them moving to England to live.

Mr Justice Roderic Wood agreed.

The children's mother was diagnosed with cancer, which eventually caused her death. She took her children to England for treatment, but never returned to her husband in Australia

The judge said the man had been misled by his ex-wife and the children had been wrongfully retained by her in England.

He said the man had not consented or acquiesced to the children starting a new life in England.

Neither child objected to returning to their father in Australia, and they had not 'settled' in England, he added.

He said there was no evidence the children were told of any plans to keep them in England permanently.

'The children left Australia in July 2013 for a holiday,' the judge said.

'They did not say goodbye to their friends, school or neighbours.

'They left many favoured objects behind them fully intending to return.'

The judge said the man had been misled by his ex-wife and the children had been wrongfully retained by her in England. The children left Australia with no indication it would be permanent, leaving behind their father, school, friends and many treasured possessions
