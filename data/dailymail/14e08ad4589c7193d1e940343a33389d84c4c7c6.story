A forensic psychologist called in to analyse the Sydney siege gunman has revealed how just hours after the ordeal ended he counselled a crying Muslim taxi driver who feared for his life because two people had been killed by a man claiming to be part of his religion.

Self-styled Sheik Man Haron Monis forced his 18 hostages to hold up an Islamic Shahada flag, which bore an inscription 'There is no god but God, and Mohamed is the messenger of God' during his 16-hour siege at the Lindt Café in Martin Place. 

As Tim Watson-Munro hoped into a cab to travel to his office on Elizabeth Street, not far from the scene where Monis killed Lindt manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson, he noticed his bearded driver looked upset.

The driver had not seen the #illridewithyou hashtag which has gone viral around the world as some Australians ensured members of the country’s Muslim community that they place no blame at their door for the actions of one madman - Monis.

Forensic psychologist Tim Watson-Munro had offered his  advice on gunman Man Haron Monis during the Sydney siege and then found himself consoling a fearful Muslim taxi just hours later

The terrified driver began sobbing as Mr Watson-Munro asked him: ‘Are you OK?’

Mr Watson-Munro gave the man a hug as the driver poured out his grief and fears.

‘He burst into tears and he said “I can’t believe what has happened. I grieve for the deceased and the country”,’ Mr Watson-Munro told Daily Mail Australia.

The criminal profiler said he tried to reassure him but the driver was crying so uncontrollably that he told him to pull over to the side of the road.

‘I told him these tragedies occur and they are great tragedies. I have enough faith in this country that they are not going to say “this is a Muslim inspired tragedy”,’ Mr Watson-Munro said.

Mr Watson-Munro noticed his Sydney taxi driver looked upset and ask him if he was 'OK'

‘He said “I work as a taxi driver I’m very frightened someone will kill me today” and my heart went out to him. Whose wouldn't?

‘We pulled over and spoke for half an hour to reassure and calm him down. I said by and large this is an egalitarian and fair country we live in and no one is going to blame him for what happened.’

Mr Watson-Munro said that in his view it’s a ‘terrible event that has resulted in huge tragedy’.

The taxi driver thanked him and said ‘it’s so good to know there are good Australians who understand’.

Mr Watson-Munro said he hoped ‘one of the lessons coming out of it [the siege] is the need for greater financial resources to go into treating the mentally ill’.

In his opinion the actions of 50-year-old Monis,  killed in siege, were the actions of ‘random craziness’.

‘I had a bad feeling about it in terms of what were his motives beyond wanting to hold up a flag and talk to Tony Abbott?... I don’t know if it was attention seeking that went majestically wrong.’

The unlikely moment of shared grief between a man who has worked as a forensic psychologist on mass murders and a Sydney taxi driver comes after a young Brisbane woman, Rachael Jacobs, posted a moving Facebook status about her encounter with a Muslim woman on Monday.

‘...and the (presumably) Muslim woman sitting next to me on the train silently removes her hijab,’ Ms Jacobs wrote.

‘I ran after her at the train station. I said “put it back on. I'll walk with u”. She started to cry and hugged me for about a minute - then walked off alone.’

The hashtag #illridewithyou had gone viral within hours on social media, as Twitter users from around the country offered to ride public transport with people who feel intimidated by anti-Muslim sentiment.

The hashtag was soon picked up by his followers, gaining support from fellow Australians who offered lifts to work, promises of protection, and friendship to anyone feeling threatened
