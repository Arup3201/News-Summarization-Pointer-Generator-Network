Watching fashion royalty Anna Wintour and Kate Moss air kiss on the FROW sealed the deal on just how much of a big deal Topshop Unique has become.

From the get-go the collection lived up to the hype. A sea of blue opened the show, with the very first cobalt coat instantly impressing.

Shorts paired with over the knee boots, plus a belted blazer worn with one shoulder strategically shrugged off, offered up a new take on preppy. The same was true of shift dresses over crisp white shirts.

Trend wise, we've definitely noted down the culottes and puffa jackets seen on Topshop's catwalk as ones to watch for this AW.

Mustard,
 beige and camel pieces followed - including model of the moment Jourdan
 Dunn sporting an embroidered mustard dress with a shirt style collar - 
sure to emerge as a must-have item.

Across
 the broad, fur played a major part, popping up in panelling, oversized 
stoles and gilets. Most of all, the fur jackets and coats stole the 
limelight.

Puffer jackets were an obvious theme in the collection

Heavy embellishment added a touch of glamour to the stone colour palette

Colbalt was the colour of choice at the Topshop Unique show

Tan and camel colours paired with soft leathers and fur gave an autumnal feel

Layering was also a staple style of the Autumn/Winter 14 collection

Kate Moss is a huge fan of fur coats 
with a vast vintage collection - so the multi-coloured patchwork 1970s 
inspired creation must have caught her attention. We imagine the party 
perfect LBD would be right up her street too.

Mossy
 was accompanied by her younger half-sister Lottie Moss, who was signed 
to Storm models earlier this year and was most likely enjoying an 
introduction to Sir Philip Green who was, of course, in his usual spot 
next to Kate.

Although
 Cara Delevingne was notably absent from the Topshop catwalk she 
normally frequents, her older sister Poppy was sitting FROW.

Poppy
 told us, 'it was a really great collection, with some beautiful pieces -
 I especially loved the party dresses, they had a really fun feel to 
them. And the outerwear was all amazing.'

Want to emulate the Topshop girl? Hannah Murray, head make-up artist for Topshop beauty, talked MailOnline through the look she created for yesterday’s hot-ticketed Unique show.

Murray, one of fashion week's coolest and most collected make-up artists, went back to beauty basics this season and you'll be pleased to hear it's really simple to replicate at home.

‘We’re doing a rebellious boarding schoolgirl. She’s a good girl gone bad, tough but pure at the same time,’ she said of the inspiration.

‘The idea was to do this beautiful, almost choir boy like skin – so very velvety with a lovely flush that comes quite low on the cheek. 

‘I then toughened it up with a black kohl eyeliner right in the waterline and quite low down on the eye so it gives the models a darkness. They’re a bit dark and quite dangerous for a young girl,’ she explained.

Hannah then hooked the eyeliner into the inner corners above the eye and clumped together the lashes with tonnes of 3D curve mascara to achieve a ‘cloggy’ effect.

‘This is a girl who has done her make-up for the first time so she’s experimenting’, added Hannah.

Beauty aficionados can look forward to the new Topshop Check Gels, a light gel-based cream cheek colour due to hit stores this summer, which Hannah road-tested backstage on the likes of fashion week stalwarts, Jourdan Dunn and Sam Rollinson.

‘They look like pots of jam, which I love,’ said Hannah, who used them to create a ‘blood just rushed to the cheek’ effect.

Hannah flew straight into the show from a stint at New York Fashion Week and she was glad to be back on home ground.

She said: ‘I just love the buzz and excitement here in London. I love the new talent and generation of designers; it’s a really exciting time here.’
