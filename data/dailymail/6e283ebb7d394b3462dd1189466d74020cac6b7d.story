The controversial scheme to make mortgages cheaper is expected to be reined in within months amid concerns that the housing market is in danger of overheating.

Chancellor George Osborne said the Bank of England was vigilant about the rising cost of property in many areas and would intervene if needed.

He was responding to an international report that Britain's booming housing market was becoming a threat to economic recovery.

Overheating? New figures have revealed house prices increased at the fastest pace since the start of the financial crisis last month

With prices rising at up to 10 per cent a year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said there was a danger that people were borrowing more than they could ever pay back.

The OECD – a respected international think-tank – also said housebuyers should be required to put down larger deposits.

House prices increased at the fastest pace since the start of the financial crisis last month, though they remain below their pre-crisis peak in some areas.

The Bank initially dismissed the suggestion that the market was overheating. But last week one of its deputy governors, Jon Cunliffe, hinted it was time to address the impact of Help to Buy on the sharp rise in prices.

The OECD urged the Bank to tighten access to Help to Buy funds, which provides guarantees for mortgages in an attempt to help first-time buyers into the market.

Cutting the maximum purchase price under Help to Buy to £300,000 from £600,000 would address concerns that it is fuelling a house price bubble, senior figures believe.

The latest figures show that the average cost of a house bought using the scheme's mortgage guarantee is £148,048.

The North West and Scotland are the  most popular areas for Help to Buy, and the scheme is overwhelmingly benefiting first-time buyers.

Business Secretary Vince Cable has claimed that backing purchases of up to £600,000 risks overheating the property market, and is understood to be planning to discuss the issue with Bank governor Mark Carney in the next few weeks.

The scheme guarantees £130billion of mortgages and is available for loans of between 80 and 95 per cent of the property's value. 

So for someone able to muster a five per cent deposit, the Government is putting in up to 15 per cent, enabling the homebuyer to access an 80 per cent mortgage.

If a property is repossessed, the Government will bear a proportion of the losses, with the lender taking the rest.

Ministers insist there is no evidence that Help to Buy is fuelling the rise in house prices, though several lenders, including Nationwide and Halifax, report higher demand triggered by the scheme encouraging the housing market recovery.

Senior Liberal Democrats claim that the Chancellor is prepared to see the housing market overheat in the run-up to next year's General Election, boosting economic confidence and increasing the chances of a Tory victory. Mr Osborne, said in Brussels yesterday: 'I've said we should be vigilant about the housing market and this government has given the Bank of England the powers, the tools to do that in an independent way.'

The Chancellor added: 'That didn't exist before but we've learnt from the mistakes of the last Government and the Bank of England has the tools and independence to do what it feels it needs to do to help to  contribute to building that resilient economy.'

The OECD also suggested another possibility was to require homebuyers to once again put down larger deposits, suggesting 'the introduction of higher capital requirements or low maximum loan-to-value ratios for mortgages'.

The new financial watchdog created by  the Coalition, the Financial Conduct  Authority, has already introduced  tougher questions about the lifestyle of  mortgage applicants.

Forensic questions about customers' regular outgoings – including childcare costs, gym membership and even haircuts – could be included in affordability checks.

Lenders should also test the ability of the family's finances to withstand a rise in interest rates.

Brokers have warned that the changes could lead to delays and unfair rejections of applications.
