The 2014 World Cup is the most-streamed live sporting event in U.S. history after ESPN reporting that 30 million hours of soccer have been viewed so far via its website and app.

The tournament in Brazil has comfortably beaten the previous record, the 2012 Summer Olympics, which generated 20.4 million viewing hours online, according to NBC. Earlier this year the Winter Olympics in Sochi generated 10.8 million viewing hours.

There are several reasons why the World Cup has smashed steaming records, including the growing popularity of live steaming apps and the fact that a number of matches have been played during working hours in the U.S., reports CNN.

During last Thursday's USA-Germany match, the WatchESPN app set a new record for the number of simultaneous viewers - 1.7 million toward the end of the match and that was despite some users complaining that the service didn’t work for part of the match.

The previous record had been set the previous Sunday during America’s 2:2 draw with Portugal.

From the beginning of the competition on June12 up until the end of Monday, ESPN has streamed 1.8 billion live minutes, or 29.8 million hours, according to a spokesperson.

On Tuesday, the USA-Belgium match peaked with 1.5 million simultaneous viewers through WatchESPN.

It isn’t just ESPN which has been enjoying a World Cup-related boost.

Univision has been live-streaming its Spanish language coverage of the matches and Sunday's Mexico-Netherlands match was streamed by an average of 303,000 viewers.

It was also watched on TV by another 10.4 million people, which made it not only the 'most-viewed soccer match in Spanish-language television history,' but also 'the most-viewed telecast in Spanish-language television history.'

The tournament ends on July 13 when the final will be held in Rio de Janeiro.
