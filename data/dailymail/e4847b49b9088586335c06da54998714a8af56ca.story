Britain has been accused of airbrushing the role of Anzac troops out of this year's First World War commemorations in favour of soldiers from developing nations.

Reports in Australia claim no 100-year anniversary events have been planned by Britain that specifically recognise the sacrifice made by Australia and New Zealand.

Instead, it has been suggested Whitehall officials in London have been briefed to push the efforts by the so-called 'New Commonwealth' nations.

A total of 20,761 British, Australian and Indian soldiers were killed at Anzac Cove in April 1915

This is despite 62,000 Australians and 18,000 New Zealanders who died in the Great War fighting for the British Empire. Another 156,000 from Australia were wounded and 41,000 from New Zealand.

According to News.com.au, British government sources have confirmed internal briefings on commemorations have not mentioned Australia or New Zealand once.

It is claimed the civil service has been told to concentrate on other British Empire contributions by soldiers from countries such as Nigeria and other dominions in West Africa, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Reports say the push is to promote 'community cohesion' and link younger generations of ethnic Britons today to the war fought by their forefathers.

It is also seen as high-level support for old colonies like India which is experiencing a booming economy.

A government insider told News.com.au: 'It's basically to remind Britons the First World War wasn't just soldiers from here fighting in France and Belgium but involved people from Lagos, Kingston and the Punjab,' a government insider said.

'There has been no mention of old Commonwealth Allies like Australia or New Zealand but more interest in celebrating the role from New Commonwealth countries. I think it's fair to say Commonwealth ties are being frayed a little on this one.'

The British Department For Culture, Media and Sport, tasked with First World War anniversary events, confirmed there were no plans to have any specific events recognising Australia's contribution to the British Empire's cause.

'I don't think there is anything specific at this stage for individual countries,' a spokeswoman said. 'It is obviously a four-year program so there may well be specific things as we go along but nothing specific at this stage.'

British author and commentator Murray Rowlands said it was a disgrace Australian and New Zealanders were being ignored.

He told News.com.au: 'There is nothing in (British Prime Minister) David Cameron's program of commemoration that mentions these countries,' he said.

'The British pretty much lost the war in July 1918, they were in retreat and it was the Australians and New Zealanders who got put into the gap… they were the ones that held up the Germans in places like Hamel (Somme, northern France), with the Americans too but basically the well-trained Australians, pretty battle hardened by then, who stopped the Germans.

'If they had got to Amiens the game would have been gone because that was where the British communication system were. That needs recognition.'

Australia's Department of Veterans Affairs and the Australian High Commission in London are planning a series of Australian-specific events in the UK this year and next year, the 100th anniversary of Gallipoli.

The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (Anzac) fought alongside their British, French and other allies at Gallipoli in Turkey during World War One.

The background to the Gallipoli landings was one of deadlock on the Western Front in 1915, when the British hoped to capture Constantinople.

The Russians were under threat from the Turks in the Caucasus and needed help, so the British decided to bombard and try to capture Gallipoli.

Located on the western coast of the Dardanelles, the British hoped by eventually getting to Constantinople that they would link up with the Russians.

The intention of this was to then knock Turkey out of the war. A naval attack began on February 19 but it was called off after three battleships were sunk.

Then by the time of another landing on April 25, the Turks had been given time to prepare better fortifications and increased their armies sixfold.

Australian and New Zealand troops won a bridgehead at Anzac Cove as the British aimed to land at five points in Cape Helles - but only managed three.

The British still required reinforcements in these areas and the Turkish were able to bring extra troops onto the peninsula to better defend themselves.

A standstill continued through the summer in hot and filthy conditions, and the campaign was eventually ended by the War Council in winter 1915.

The invasion had been intended to knock Turkey out of the war, but in the end it only gave the Russians some breathing space from the Turks.

Turkey lost around 300,000 men and the Allies had 214,000 killed - more than 8,000 of whom were Australian soldiers, in a disastrous campaign.

Anzac Cove became a focus for Australian pride after forces were stuck there in squalid conditions for eight months, defending the area from the Turks.

The Anzac soldiers who arrived on the narrow strip of beach were faced with a difficult environment of steep cliffs and ridges - and almost daily shelling.

At the height of the fighting during the landings of April 25, 1915, the waters around the peninsula were stained red with blood at one point 50 metres out.

Fierce resistance from the under-rated Ottoman forces, inhospitable terrain and bungled planning spelt disaster for the campaign.

Among those who suffered the greatest losses were the Anzacs Australian and New Zealand Army Corps who made the first landings, swept by an unexpected current to a narrow cove rather than the wide beaches the planners intended.

War historian Charles Bean wrote: ‘That strongly marked and definite entity, the Anzac tradition, had, from the first morning, been partly created here’.

But despite the toll in human life, the campaign is seen as a landmark in the formation of national consciousness in the two countries. The 25th of April was officially named Anzac Day in 1916.
