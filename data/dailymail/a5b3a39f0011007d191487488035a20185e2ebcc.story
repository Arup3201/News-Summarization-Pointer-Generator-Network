A woman who wrote in her journal that it was 'ahmazing' to kill her nine-year-old neighbor when she was 15 has asked a judge to overturn her guilty plea.

Alyssa Bustamante, now 19, appeared in court in Jefferson County, Missouri on Thursday and she only pleaded guilty to killing Elizabeth Olten in 2009 because she had been threatened with a life in prison without parole.

After admitting to authorities that she strangled and stabbed her neighbor because she wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone, she was charged as an adult with 
first-degree murder, which carries a mandatory prison sentence of life 
without the possibility of parole.

But in January 2012, just before she was to go to 
trial, Bustamante pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of 
second-degree murder and was sentenced to life with a chance of parole.

Killer: Alyssa Bustamante, 19, pictured in court on Thursday, says she only pleaded guilty to killing her neighbor because she faced the possibility of life without parole, and wanted to reduce the sentence

'I couldn't wrap my mind around it. It was just hopelessness,' Bustamante said in court on Thursday.

Bustamante, who appeared in court wearing an orange prison suit and shackled, added that she didn't understand many of the legal issues her attorneys talked about.

Her grandmother, who raised her, sat on a courtroom bench a couple of rows behind her.

Elizabeth's mother, Patty Preiss, sat on 
the opposite side of the courtroom, wearing a sweatshirt with her 
daughter's smiling photo inside of a heart and the words: 'Always Loved,
 Never Forgotten.'

In 2012, she also pleaded guilty to armed criminal action for using a knife in the 
killing and was handed an additional 30-year sentence to run after her 
life sentence.

But five months after Bustamante 
pleaded guilty, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a separate case that 
juveniles cannot face automatic life sentences without the possibility 
of parole.

Bustamante's new attorney is citing that ruling as a reason to reverse her guilty plea.

'The
 threat of (life without parole) as a mandatory sentence was allowed to 
intimidate Alyssa into accepting a guilty plea she would not have 
otherwise accepted,' Gary Brotherton wrote in 
court documents.

Bustamante was just 15 at the time she
 strangled and slashed the nine-year-old girl to death, saying she 
wanted to know what it was like to kill someone.

Prosecutors
 said Bustamante plotted Elizabeth's death, even digging two holes to be
 used as graves, then attended school for about a week while waiting for
 the right time to kill.

The girl had been playing with 
Bustamante's younger half-sister, aged six, when the older girl led her 
into the woods, saying she had a surprise for her.

Bustamante told the court that she used a knife to cut Elizabeth's throat and then strangled the girl with her hands.

Hundreds of volunteers searched for two days for Elizabeth before her body was found.

At a November 2009 hearing, Missouri 
State Highway Patrol Sgt. David Rice testified that she led authorities 
to Elizabeth's body. Rice said Bustamante said 'she wanted to know what 
it felt like' to kill.

On the night of the killing, she wrote in her diary that it had been 'ahmazing'.

'I
 just f***ing killed someone,' she wrote in the entry, which was read 
aloud in court. 'I strangled them and slit their throat and stabbed them
 now they're dead. I don't know how to feel atm [at the moment].

'It
 was ahmazing. As soon as you get over the "ohmygawd I can't do this" 
feeling, it's pretty enjoyable. I'm kinda nervous and shaky though right
 now. Kay, I gotta go to church now...lol.'

Following the latest revelations that 
Bustamante wants the plea overturned, prosecutor Mark Richardson said 
the claims 'do not have any merit' and her original sentence should 
stand.

'Generally, they're 
very big long shots to try to prove that somehow some bad advice caused a
 person to plead guilty when they otherwise wouldn't have,' Richardson 
said in an interview.

Bustamante's
 attorney claims her due process rights were violated because the 
initial first-degree murder charge would have led to an 
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment.

He added in court documents that her actual sentence is also unconstitutional because 'it does not provide her with any realistic opportunity for release'.

When she was sentenced, the Missouri Department of Corrections said Bustamante would have to serve 35 years and five months before she is eligible for parole. She's in prison in eastern Missouri.

Brotherton's court filing also argues that Bustamante's original attorneys provided ineffective advice.

It says they pressured her during a more than half hour jailhouse visit to make a quick decision to plead guilty to second-degree murder without explaining that the pending Supreme Court case could have affected her punishment.

'They said I could go think about it, but the urgency they expressed made me feel like I couldn't,' she said in court on Thursday.

Juvenile justice officials testified that
 Bustamante had attempted to commit suicide in 2007 and had been 
receiving mental health treatment for depression and cutting herself.
