Miley Cyrus and Jessie J may have caught the world's attention when they chopped off their flowing locks - but the majority of British women are not as adventurous.

According to the latest study, unadventurous Brits are stuck in a hairstyle rut with a staggering 80 per cent of women opting for a safe hairstyle.

While they say a new hairstyle can change your life, the latest study showed that 60 per cent of women would rather change their style of clothes than change their hairstyle.

Not quite as adventurous: Unlike Jessie J and Miley Cyrus, 80 per cent of British women stick to the same hairstyle

And it's the mature women over the age of 55 who are more adventurous with their looks than those in their thirties - because they don't care what people think of them.

While 44 per cent of people feel that they are due a change of hairstyle, most of them do not know what else to do with their hair and are too scared to change what suits them.

The poll also revealed confident 
Londoners do not care what others think of their hairstyle as opposed 
to the more conscious women of East Anglia.

Hair idol: Women in their mid-twenties are lusting after the Duchess of Cambridge's locks, while women in their late teens want shiny slick hair like Kim Kardashian

It’s no surprise to see that women in
their mid-twenties are lusting after Kate Middleton’s locks, while 
women in their late teens want shiny slick hair like Kim Kardashian.  

Simon Comins, Buying Director at Superdrug, who carried out the survey, said: 'The research shows that women are obviously bolder with their hair colour choice than their hair style.

Dramatic style: Older celebrities such as Sharon Osbourne and Vivienne Westwood are renowned for their audacious looks and dramatic style

'It’s great to see the older generation leading the way with adventurous styles. Older celebrities such as Vivienne Westwood, Zandra Rhodes and Sharon Osbourne are all renowned for their audacious looks and dramatic style changes proving the over fifties are obviously more confident and open to change.'

'It’s interesting to see that girls in their teens are most influenced by advice from online forums; to cater for all ages who turn to the virtual world we have just launched a new blog, Look At Me which has been specially designed to educate women on different trends and looks for all styles and ages.'
