The coalition is to go to war with the trade unions, using reforms in the wake of the lobbying scandal to open up the membership of Labour's biggest financial backers.

Downing Street revealed legislation will be rushed out before the summer recess, creating a new statutory register of lobbyists after an MP and three peers were embroiled in a new sleaze scandal after being recorded by undercover reporters offering to publicise causes in exchange for money.

But the new laws will also include changes to election funding rules and tougher checks on union membership in an attempt to curb the influence of unions on British politics.

Confrontation: The move to use new lobbying laws to target trade unions, which have opposed government spending cuts, is likely to prove controversial

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today promised to act to deal with the 'murkier side of 
British politics'.

Voters will be able to sack sleazy 
MPs and lobbyists will be regulated, Mr Clegg vowed as he 
insisted the government would act to 'clean up' British politics.

The Deputy Prime Minister admitted 
the two years left before the next election was not long enough to give 
Westminster the overhaul it really needs.

But the bill creating a lobbyists register will also include measures to end self-certification of union membership and reform third-party contributions to election campaigns.

Under the new proposals, unions will be required to carry out an annual audit of their membership and demonstrate that the figures they produce are accurate.

The Certification Officer will be given the power to conduct investigations into the numbers produced, which are vital when ballots on strike action are conducted.

And unions appear to be the main 
target of the proposed changes to third-party election campaign funding,
which will apply to organisations affiliated to political parties as 
those making major donations of more than £100,000.

The reforms will ensure that the true
value of activities such as leaflet-printing is reflected when judging 
whether parties have breached the £19 million cap on campaign spending 
in the year before a general election, said No 10.

When calculating the campaign 
spending they must declare, organisations such as unions would have to 
include not only the cost of printing a leaflet but also overheads such 
as staffing and rent on premises - which could potentially inflate the 
figure considerably.

Mr Clegg said earlier that fresh allegations of wrongdoing highlighted the need for action.

'It's the political equivalent of groundhog day: MPs accused of abusing their position; businesses of getting too close,' he said.

The coalition will press ahead with 
promised plans for a power of recall, 'where any MP guilty of serious 
misconduct could be forced to resign if enough of their constituents 
wanted them to,' Mr Clegg said.

There will also be a crackdown on lobbyists, including a statutory register.

'Clearly there are instances where 
access is abused – further undermining the already weak public trust in 
our institutions – and greater transparency is a key part of the 
antidote,' Mr Clegg wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

The crackdown comes after three members of the House of Lords were embroiled in a new sleaze scandal.

In what was branded a ‘new low for 
British politics’, Labour kicked out two peers and a third resigned from
the Ulster Unionists after they were recorded offering to do 
parliamentary business in exchange for cash.

Tory
Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude yesterday said the Government is 
set to legislate to create a statutory register of lobbyists in this 
session of Parliament – even though it was dropped from the recent 
Queen’s Speech.

‘We are 
going to do this,’ he said, adding that he would be ‘astonished’ if the 
powers were not in place by the next general election in 2015.

But today Mr Maude admitted the register would not have prevented the cases which have made headlines in recent days.

The House of Lords is a 'stinking swamp' of corruption dominated by 'dirty money', a senior Lib Dem peer claimed today.

Lord Oakeshott called for an end to foreign governments bankrolling All Party Parliamentary Groups.

He said a register of lobbyists would be useful 'as far as it goes' but Lords and party funding reform was also needed. 

The Lib Dem told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I regard it a little bit like eradicating malaria in Africa, you use a bit of disinfectant on the mosquito, which a statutory register would be, but we have got to clean out the stinking swamp, which is particularly the House of Lords, where there is a very nasty whiff of dirty money the whole time.'

He said rules must be changed to allow disgraced peers to be suspended for up to 10 years and called for all-party parliamentary groups to be reviewed.He later told MailOnline: 'I don't think we should have these groups paid for by foreign governments.'

He singled out the Cayman Islands group, which receives support from the government in the renowned tax haven.

'That is a lobbying operation to stop us cracking down properly on the Cayman Islands.

'All-party groups like that make it more difficult for HMRC and the British government to collect the full amount of tax and make sure foreign companies pay the right tax.'

'The
statutory register of lobbyists would have made no difference in this 
case at all because what’s alleged to have happened would have been 
against the rules, parliamentary rules, in any event,' he told ITV's 
Daybreak.

However, Labour dismissed the plans as 'shabby' attempt to deflect attention from Tory embarrassment over the lobbying scandal.

A Labour source: 'The best way to proceed if you want to take big money out of politics and clean up the lobbying scandal is to act on a cross-party basis. Labour has done so.

'This seems to be a shabby and panicked response by David Cameron to divert attention from a set of damaging headlines hitting the Conservative Party.'

The
scandal escalated yesterday after Labour suspended two 
peers for offering to assist undercover reporters who were posing as 
lobbyists.

Former Cabinet 
minister Lord Cunningham – once known as ‘Junket Jack’ for his love of 
the high life – and former senior police officer Lord Mackenzie of 
Framwellgate denied wrongdoing.

But they and Ulster Unionist Lord Laird 
were all recorded discussing how, in return for payment, they could help
lobbyists representing a fake solar energy firm by pushing their 
agenda.

Today it was announced that the three peers will be investigated by the House of Lords standards commissioner has begun investigating the three peers caught up in a lobbying scandal.

Leader of the House Lord Hill of Oareford described the allegations as 'very serious and distressing'.

The Sunday Times 
released a video of Lord Cunningham saying he would accept fees of 
£12,000 a month – £144,000 a year – to ask parliamentary questions on 
their behalf, and that he could ‘get other people to ask questions as 
well’.

He told undercover 
reporters he offered ‘value for money’ because he could introduce them 
to senior members of all three of the main political parties.

Lord Mackenzie, a former president of 
the Police Superintendents’ Association, said he could arrange parties 
for paying clients on the terrace of the House of Lords.

And he said he 
could get around Lords rules requiring peers to declare financial 
interests by asking ‘a colleague who has nothing to do with it, “would 
you host a function for me?” ’.

Lord Laird told undercover reporters 
that, working together, peers could ask parliamentary questions for each
other’s clients, put down amendments in debates or write to ministers.

He
was also embroiled in a second, separate sting operation after telling 
reporters from BBC Panorama, who were posing as lobbyists, that he would
be interested in accepting a retainer of £2,000 a month to lobby for 
Fiji. He indicated that he would use the promise of a trip to Fiji as a 
‘bribe’ in order to get others to join the group. He was recorded 
saying: ‘I’ll deny having said this, but it’s a bribe.’

That undercover operation – in tandem with a second national newspaper – was the same one that exposed Newark MP Patrick Mercer, who resigned from the Conservative Party on Friday after accepting £4,000 to ask parliamentary questions.

Mr Mercer said he agreed to be a consultant for work he said was outside parliament. 

But he submitted five parliamentary questions which were all answered, as well as an early day motion, all in relation to Fiji.

Last night it was suggested that a legal complaint is expected to be issued to the police so Mr Mercer can be investigated for breaches of the Bribery Act.

The House of Lords code of conduct says peers ‘must not seek to profit from membership of the House by accepting or agreeing to accept payment for providing parliamentary advice or services’.

Lord Cunningham referred his own case to the Lords Commissioner for Standards and said he was consulting lawyers. He claims he ‘quickly became suspicious’ of the journalists. He added: ‘I told them I always stick to the rules and declare any interests. I informed them the next day that I wanted nothing more to do with them.’

The MP allegedly signs a contract with the fake lobbying company set up by BBC Panorama

As the MP signs the contract he is recorded saying: 'Let's sign this, with pleasure.'

Lord Laird added: ‘I wish to make it clear that I did not agree to act as a paid advocate in any proceedings of the House, nor did I accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services.’

Lord Mackenzie said he was ‘quite happy’ that he had not broken the rules. ‘I went back to my office, I checked the codes of conduct and  I decided that it was getting a bit near the mark and I decided to decline the offer,’ he said.

Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said the latest claims were ‘a new low for British politics’ and voters would be ‘sickened’.

‘The public, who have looked on with a sense of astonishment and with a sense that there is one rule for those who govern and another set of rules for those who are governed, will just be utterly sickened by it, and they are right to be sickened,’ he said.
