French chef Albert Roux’s wife has been granted a ‘quickie’ divorce on the grounds of adultery – after she discovered he had been sleeping with his mistress in the couple’s marital bed.

In court papers, Cheryl Roux, 57, said her husband had ‘committed adultery with a woman, the identity of whom is known to me, at various times and at various locations, including the marital home and bed’.

The chef’s new partner is believed to be former Ukrainian model Nataliya Lutsyshyna.

Mr Roux, 78, met Ms Lutsyshyna, 40, when she worked as a cloakroom attendant at his restaurant Roux at Parliament Square in Central London.

When his wife found out about  the affair last year she ordered  her husband to leave their Belgravia home.

But according to court papers, it was four months before Mr Roux, pictured below, left the £2.5 million London mews house.

A friend of the couple said: ‘It  is definitely Nataliya Lutsyshyna that the divorce papers refer to.
