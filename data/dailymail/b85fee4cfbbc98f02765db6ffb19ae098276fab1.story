Twenty-nine children have been taken to hospital in Russia after medics accidentally injected them 2,500 times the recommended dose of tuberculosis during a screening test.

Eleven pupils were flown thousands of miles to Moscow from their school in the remote region of Primorsky for specialist treatment after complaining of 'severe allergic reactions' and headaches.

Another 18 are being treated in hospital locally.

Experts are not clear what the prognosis is for such an overdose as it is not believed to have occurred before.

However, they deny the children are at risk of contracting TB, it was reported by The Siberian Times.

Governor Valdimir Miklysheviskiy has fired the director of the regional health department, Oleg Bubnov, over the error which was caused when a doctor and nurse broke rules over how the test should be administered.

Delicate procedure: The test for TB involves injecting a small amount of an extract of the tuberculosis bacteria, called tuberculin, into the skin (file picture)

The Mantoux test is a widely used screening method for latent and active tuberculosis, a potentially fatal airborne bacterial infection, above, that attacks the lungs.

The test involves injecting a substance called tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) into the skin of the forearm.

In the UK, the standard dose includes two tuberculin units in 0.1ml of solution.

Within 48 to 72 hours, those with a latent infection will develop a hard red bump at the site of the injection.

If you have a very strong reaction, it may indicate you have active TB.

The test is named after Charles Mantoux, a French physician who created his test in 1907.

Mr Miklysheviskiy said: 'The health department's work must be considered unsatisfactory. The situation in Yakovlevskiy district is a failure by the health department.'

The error occurred during a widely used screening method for tuberculosis, known as the Mantoux test, on children aged 11-16 in Novosysoyevka village, Yakovlevskiy district.

The Mantoux test involves mixing a small dose of an extract of the tuberculosis bacteria, called tuberculin, into a solution ready for injection.

But Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said the medical staff instead chose to dissolve the tuberculin in a powder, a method that should only be carried in hospital conditions.

Mrs Skvortsova said: 'They made a mistake - a technical error - using a dose bigger than it should have been.

'Two children have a severe toxic and allergic reaction to the wrongly made Mantoux test. It has nothing to do with tuberculosis.'

The eleven children being treated in Moscow are expected to remain under observation for three weeks.

Three years ago, a newborn baby fell seriously ill after being given an overdose of the TB vaccine.

The boy was injected with 0.5mg of the BCG vaccine - 10 times the usual 0.05mg dose, lawyers for his family said at the time.

A statement from law firm Irwin Mitchell said the boy was treated for TB with help from the poisons agency and an expert in immunology at Sheffield Children's Hospital.
