Scarlet O'Connor, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, was forced to flee to Australia after a rejected lover set her house on fire 

A 23-year-old has told how she was forced to flee to Australia after a rejected lover bombarded her with thousands of text messages then set fire to her home.

Scarlet O'Connor, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, had known Aiden Feeney for four years before they had a one-night stand in August 2013.

But, despite Ms O'Connor making it clear that the relationship was purely platonic, the jilted 24-year-old launched a hate campaign against his former lover.

He sent her up to 3,000 text messages in the space of four days, spoke of ‘ripping her head off’ and even gloated that he knew someone who would burn her house down in exchange for £1,000. 

Soon after, Feeney paid a teenager £850 to torch Miss O'Connor's home, an act which caused £18,000 worth of damage and destroyed the entire ground floor.

Feeney was finally jailed for eight-and-a-half years in August  after being found guilty of arson with intent to endanger life. He was also found guilty of two counts of harassment.

But despite Feeney being behind bars, Miss O'Connor is still haunted by the memories of her terrifying ordeal and decided to start a new life in Perth.

Speaking about the incident, Miss O'Connor said: 'Aiden ruined my life. For weeks, I was too scared to sleep because I was worried about what he'd do and I was always looking over my shoulder.

'I'm gutted Aiden will only serve half of his sentence. I don't even want to think about what he'll do once he's released.

'I moved away from the UK because I'd had a rubbish year and I knew going to Australia would help me forget the memories.' 

Miss O'Connor, now a part-time waitress, told how she became a nervous wreck and refused to leave her home after she started being hounded by unemployed Feeney.

She said: 'I made it clear that I thought of him as a friend and nothing more, but he pestered me for a date.

'I declined and he became possessive, even texting me accusing me of speaking to other boys.

'I told him that he wasn't my boyfriend and I could do whatever I wanted. He became angry and made threatening calls to my male friends, and sent me texts saying: "Watch what happens if you keep texting these guys".'

The pair (pictured together) were friends for four years before they slept together in August 2013, but Miss O'Connor said she always made it clear that she did not want to pursue a relationship with Feeney

Days later, the living room window at Miss O'Connor's home - which she shared with her sister Lauren, 28, and housemate Nadia, 31 - was smashed.

Feeney then bombarded Ms O'Connor with texts, begging her to go on a date with him. He even texted her telling her how he knew someone who would burn down her house. 

The 24-year-old, from Worsley, Greater Manchester, promised to end the abuse if Miss O'Connor agreed to a date with him.

But when she refused, he texted her threatening messages, including one that read: 'Watch what happens'.

The threats prompted firemen to carry out an urgent risk assessment of Miss O’Connor's home, where they installed extra smoke alarms and taped up the letterbox  as a precaution.

She said: 'Aiden's threats were relentless. I lived in constant fear and was crying all the time.

'I became reclusive and was gripped by worry whenever I plucked the courage to leave my house.

She added: 'I was terrified. My sister's boyfriend, a firefighter, secured our house by sealing the letterbox, and installing a panic button and further fire alarms.

'I kept my ordeal secret from my parents as I was too embarrassed to tell them. I didn't want them worrying about me.'   

One month later, Miss O'Connor's friends finally convinced her to join them on a night out. But when she returned, she found her housemate's car window had been bricked. 

Worried for her safety, Miss O'Connor stayed over at her friend's house. Then, a few weeks later in September, she was woken by a phone call from her sister, screaming that their house was on fire.

After the curtains caught on fire, the blaze spread through the property, destroying the entire ground floor.

Her sister, who was in the house at the time, managed to escape unharmed.   

Feeney was arrested a week later after police received reports of him hiding in an abandoned flat.

It later emerged that he had paid Tyler Bennett, 19, £850 to carry out the job.

Bennett had taken a taxi to the house, where he threw firelighters through the front window after being unable to open the letterbox.  

On another occasion, Miss O'Connor's sister had a brick thrown through  her car window (pictured left) and windscreen (pictured right)

The house Miss O'Connor shared with her friend and sister was also targeted in an attack, which left the front window smashed (pictured)

Feeney and Bennett were convicted at Manchester Crown Court in August.

The court heard how Feeney, who tried and failed to get in to the Army, already has convictions for arson and harassment after targeting a previous girlfriend. 

Bennett was jailed for four years after being convicted of arson with intent to endanger life.

Despite moving to the other side of the world, Ms O'Connor remains affected by Feeney's actions.

She said: 'I have no trust any more. I certainly don't want to get involved with any more men.

'If I'd have stayed in England, I'd have spent the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.'
