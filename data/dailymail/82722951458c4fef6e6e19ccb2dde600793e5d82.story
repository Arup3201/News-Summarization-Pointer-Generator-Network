Melbourne Demons AFL football coach Paul Roos has sold his stunning five-bedroom home in the coastal Sydney suburb of Coogee. 

Further severing his ties with Sydney, where he lived while coach of the premiership-winning Swans, the newly renovated property, designed by award-winning architect Con Hairis, was sold off-market for $5.4 million.

The luxury home features an entertainment and rooftop terrace, a heated pool and spa, a monitored security system, lavish designer bathrooms and a breathtaking 360 degree backdrop of the Pacific.

The key features are a cutting-edge Miele kitchen, heated pool and spa and multi zoned air-conditioning.

The Sydney sale comes after Roos spent $2.5 million on a modern property in Ellwood, south Melbourne and follows his recent decision to extend his contract at the Demons.

As well as playing for the Fitzroy Lions and the Sydney Swans, he also coached the Swans between 2002 and 2010, leading them to the premiership in 2005, breaking a 72-year wait.

Late in 2013,  Roos became the senior coach of bottom-placed Melbourne in a bid to turn around the fortunes of the struggling club.
