For thousands of years, 17 giant slabs of stone formed a bridge across a river in Exmoor.

The Tarr Steps were even said to have been built by the devil so he could sunbathe, according to legend - but that didn't stop them getting washed away in floods last year.

Today, engineers began the painstaking task of rebuilding the 180ft-long crossing, which some believe dates back to 1000 BC.

Situated on the River Barle in Somerset, it collapsed after being struck by a 10ft wall of flood water on December 22.

Engineers began to rebuild the Tarr Steps in Exmoor today after the ancient bridge was washed away by floods last December

A construction crew has already moved some of the two-tonne slabs - each measuring up to 8ft - out of the water with heavy lifting machinery

Each step had previously been numbered in the event that the Grade I-listed structure was ever damaged, so the teams will carefully slot them back together in the coming days

The bridge as it looked before the floodwater caused it to collapse

Legend has it that the devil built the bridge at Tarr Steps and had rights over sunbathing on the stones.

Anyone who tried to cross the bridge, it was said, did so at the risk that they would be killed by the devil, who swore an oath to crush anyone who passed from one side to the other.

It is claimed that locals once sent a cat across the bridge to test the myth – and the animal was vaporised.

Only after confrontation with the local parson is the devil supposed to have withdrawn the threat.

The bridge, which links the Somerset villages of Withypool and Dulverton, was also washed away in 1952 and had to be rebuilt by the Army.

Following further damage in 1982, two thick 'hawser' cables were strung across the river to protect it - but both snapped during December's floods.

At the time, local resident Martin Hesp told the Daily Mail: ‘I have lived in the area for over 50 years and I have never seen anything like this before.

‘It must have been some mighty trees which were carried downstream and smashed through them.’

Contractors working for Somerset County Council are in charge of the rebuild

The Tarr Steps is one of Britain's best preserved examples of a clapper bridge, derived from the Latin 'claperius', meaning 'pile of stones'

The bridge was constructed out of stone slabs supported on stone piers, which stick three feet out of the water when the river is at its normal level

Contractors working for Somerset County Council are in charge of the latest rebuild which started this afternoon.

Rob Wilson-North, conservation manager for the Exmoor National Park Authority, was there when the swollen Barle washed away the historic stones.

He said: 'It was the speed of the water - it was absolutely terrifying, it was moving so fast.

'I've worked on Exmoor for 20 years and I've never seen it like that. For me, it was absolutely shocking.'

'Tarr' is thought to have derived from the Celtic word 'tochar' for causeway.

Some locals believe it dates back to around 1000 BC, although experts have said it's more likely to date back to the Middle Ages.

The
 first recorded mention of the Tarr Steps was in the 14th century.
