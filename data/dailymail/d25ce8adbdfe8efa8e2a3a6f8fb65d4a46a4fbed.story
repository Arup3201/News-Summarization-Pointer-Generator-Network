New York City police believe the same man is responsible for stabbing-to-death a 6-year-old boy in a lift in Brooklyn Sunday and an 18-year-old woman nearby on Friday night - and they have launched a massive manhunt to find him.

'We got to find this man. We all have to find this man. My baby is gone,' little Prince Joshua 'P.J.' Avitto's mother Erica sobbed. The boy's cousin, Mikayala Capers, 7, was also stabbed and is still being treated in hospital.

'My niece is critical. We've got to find this man,' she added.

Authorities have released an artist's impression of the hulking suspect who also allegedly brutally murdered Tayana Grant-Copeland, 18, as she walked home from marching band practice.

Manhunt: New York police are looking for a killer who stabbed a 6-year-old boy to death and also killed an 18-year-old girl. They have released this sketch of the suspect

Victims: Tanya Grant-Copeland, pictured, was murdered Friday night while Prince Joshua Avitto, right, was killed Sunday

The teen was discovered unconscious shortly before 10:30 p.m. Friday on a sidewalk near a rail yard at Stanley Avenue and Linwood Street in Brooklyn. She had been stabbed multiple times in the neck, back and abdomen and died at Brookdale Hospital.

A taxi driver found her, according to a release from family spokesman Tony Herbert.

Her devastated mother, Rochelle Copeland, told NBC New York: 'She drums, and basically that's her whole life.' Sobbing she added: 'I didn't get to say goodbye.'

A vigil for Grant-Copeland was held at the site of the killing Saturday evening.

Yesterday, police released an image of the knife found near the elevator where the two children were butchered.

It is a Dura Edge knife by Imperial Knife, and the NYPD said it hasn't been manufactured since 2004.

They also described the suspect as a man around 25-35 years old, about 6' with a heavy build. He was last seen wearing a grey shirt.

Crime scene: Both murders took place in or near this apartment building, in the Brooklyn neighborhood of East New York

A resident told The New York Post she spotted the suspect and he was crazy.

'I saw him Friday and again on Sunday, standing there shuffling back and forth. He was wearing a gray hoodie... A black man in his early 30s, stocky, maybe 5-foot-9. He looked a little crazy.'

The shocking back-to-back slayings have prompted other residents to slam the NYC Housing

Authority after it failed to erect surveillance cameras int he area despite the City Council allocating money towards it years back.

P.J.'s distraught father Nicholas Avitto wore his son's backpack to the boy's school yesterday.

'I just walked to the school. I talked to him. I acted like he was there,' he said.

'God gave me a blessing. I had him at 50. He was born on Fatherâ€™s Day. I will remember his smile, his arrogance, his stubborn little ways.'

The father then broke down: 'I'm just so hurt. They took my little boy away from me, oh, my God.'

Mikayla, who suffered a collapsed lung in the stabbing, was transferred Monday night to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Columbia, where her mother said she is in stable condition.

'I feel blessed that she's OK,' Sherina Capers told the New York Daily News.

Tragic: Tanya Grant-Copeland, pictured, was walking home from marching band practice when she was stabbed to death

The 
children were in an elevator at an apartment block in Brooklyn's East 
New York neighborhood and heading out for ice cream when they were 
attacked at 5.50 p.m. on Sunday, police said.

The madman stabbed the young cousins in their torsos after telling them to 'shut up', a police source told the New York Daily News.

The body of the little boy was found in the elevator in the Boulevard housing development on Schenck Avenue near Stanley Avenue.

Mikayla was found in front of a neighboring building after she apparently stumbled from the elevator.

The suspect is described as an African-American man who ran off after the attack, police sources told the Daily News.

A neighbor who saw the children after the attack said Mikayla was conscious, but that she was in rough shape.

'The girl was up and talking, but she didn't look too good,' neighbor Kevin Velez, 41, told the New York Post.

'This is horrendous. The
 police need to catch this animal. I saw the 
ambulance workers cart out [the boy]. He was lifeless, just lifeless. I 
can't get the image out of my head.'

The children's relatives are struggled to comprehend the senseless crime.

'He
 took my pride and joy away,' Nicholas Avitto earlier told the Daily News, as he revealed his heartbreak that he had not 
kissed his son that day.

Mother of seven-year-old victim Mikayla Capers

'I'm 
devastated. I'm beyond comprehension. I'm trying to understand how God 
works. My son is gone. That was the light of my life.'

His mother told the New York Post that her son was just 16 days away from turning seven.

'They done killed my baby!' she said outside Brookdale Hospital.

Mikayla's mother, Sherina Capers, 21, said she couldn't understand how someone could attack two young children.

'This don't make no sense,' she said. 'They went to go get an icy and they never made it downstairs.'

A man who identified himself as Mikayla's uncle told the paper that the community is up in arms over the stabbings and went on to say 'this violence has to stop' in the crime-plagued neighborhood.

'I'm shaking. I have no idea who could have been out there doing this,' 33-year-old Lemar King said.

'They are just little kids. They never did anything to anybody.'

There is a $12,000 reward for information related to the killings. Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.
