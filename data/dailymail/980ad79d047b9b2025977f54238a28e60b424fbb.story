If you are thinking about updating your Facebook profile with photos or getting in touch with an old flame via the website, you may want to think again.

The social networking site is now cited in a third of all divorce cases, and is increasingly relied upon for proof of unreasonable behaviour, according to a survey of legal firms' caseloads.

Facebook unwittingly provides evidence of infidelity and new relationships, helps track people's movements and records expenditure on everything from cars to holidays as users document their day-to-day lives. 

Couples who are filing for divorce are increasingly relying on social media as proof of misbehavior

Leeds law firm Lake Legal said that many cases revolved around social media users who got back in touch with old flames they hadn't heard from in years.

Managing partner Lyn Ayrton says that Facebook sees us reveal certain details about our lives that can later be used in court.

'Social media provides an ongoing log of our lives. The sharing of written posts and pictures, often with geo-tagging, provides a record of activities that can be used in a court case,' she said.

Law firm Lake Legal examined 200 of their divorce cases and found that over 66 had used the social networking site as proof of their partners infidelity 

'Often, if a partner refers to an impending bonus, a new job offer, or plans for a holiday, it may provide evidence that they are not telling the truth about their financial position. At the very least, it could call their credibility into question. 

'It's like having a massive public noticeboard.'

Lyn added that she had seen the social network provide irrefutable evidence of infidelity in the past.

'Somebody said she was not in a relationship with anybody new but then posted a message inviting everybody to a housewarming party for her and her boyfriend.'

Facebook acts as a continual log of someone's life and certain photos or events attended can reveal foul play

Specialists at the firm examined more than 200 cases and found Facebook was used by legal teams in just over a third of cases.

Julian Hawkhead, a managing partner at Stowe Family Law, agrees that what we choose to post on the site can tell a lot about the lives we are living.  

'Photographs and comments made on these forums can be used as evidence of relationships or of a lifestyle which contradicts what people will otherwise try to portray.

'We regularly find clients coming to us with information they have found which is available in the public domain with proof of a relationship.'

But it isn't just Facebook that adulterers should be wary of, Julian added that there were other means of discovering details about a people's lives.  

'However, the internet can also provide a useful source of other information. Our in-house forensic accountancy team will often find rich pickings in gathering financial information through a Google search about a party, their location, where they have been and what they are doing with their lives.

'People need greater awareness of what information they are leaving about themselves on the internet which is otherwise waiting to be found at the touch of a button.'
