A 71-year-old man who had battled to die next to his wife of 46 years has passed away in their shared hospital room.

Matt Monschein died from pancreatic cancer at 1am on Tuesday - six days after he was reunited with his wife Pat, who was in hospital after having both legs amputated due to diabetes.

In March, doctors told Mr Monschein that nothing else could be done for him in the final stages of his cancer and added that he might be restricted in the time he spent with Pat due to her operation.

Dying wish: Matt and Pat Monschein were allowed to spend their last days together in hospital after Mr Monschein was told he was in the end stages of pancreatic cancer. He has now passed away

Together through life: The Monscheins were married for 46 years and hardly spent any time apart

The couple, from Lorain, were left devastated that they might not be able to spend their last moments together at Grace Fairview Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio - as it did not offer the hospice care that Mr Monschein needed.

Yet Mrs Monschein could not be looked after at a hospice as she required round-the-clock care including dialysis.

One of the couple's two sons, Mike Monschein, told Fox 8: 'He’s going to get a drive-by, see mom two hours, and that’s how you end a 46-year marriage.'

Mike had appealed to local politicians, authorities and media outlets in the hope of bringing his parents back together.

Happy: The couple married after meeting when Matt was serving in the Navy in Newfoundland, Canada

The couple had barely spent any time 
apart in almost five decades, since they met while Mr Monschein served 
in the Navy in Canada.

After being helped by a local 
TV station to navigate the bureaucracy, the elderly couple were  allowed to spend Mr Monschein's final few days lying in beds side by side at the hospital. 

Both remained in the same room and according to cleveland.com, the hospital chaplain renewed their wedding vows. 

Distraught: The couple's son Mike struggled to keep his emotions in check as he pleaded for help to keep his parents together

Last days: They were allowed to share a room at the Grace Fairview Hospital in Ohio with their beds side by side

But on Tuesday, Mr Monschein lost his fight with pancreatic cancer.

His
son Mike told The Chronicle Telegram: 'Seeing my mom again has meant 
the world to my dad and has put smiles on both of their faces.

'Dad will be missed greatly. Mom will go on with the support of family and friends.'
