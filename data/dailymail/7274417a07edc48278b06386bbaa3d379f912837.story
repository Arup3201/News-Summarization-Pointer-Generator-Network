A homeless man high on meth has been charged with aggravated murder after he allegedly killed a police officer by shooting him in the chest.

Timothy Troy Walker, 34, could face the death penalty, prosecutors said on Wednesday after he ambushed Officer Derek Johnson in Draper, Utah on September 1.

Walker, 35, has been charged with a first-degree count of aggravated murder over the killing of the 32-year-old officer, who was a married father of a young son.

He also has been charged with attempted homicide for allegedly trying to kill his girlfriend Traci 
Vaillancourt, a former model left disfigured and hooked on painkillers following a rare blood disease.

District
Attorney Sim Gill told the Salt Lake Tribune that the death penalty is 
'on the table' but prosecutors would wait until after the preliminary hearing 
and arraignment.

The suspect was booked into Salt Lake County Jail on Wednesday after his release from hospital following treatment for a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Vaillancourt was also hospitalized after her boyfriend allegedly shot her in the back. She was released on Saturday and booked into Salt Lake County Jail.

She was charged on Wednesday with two counts of obstructing justice for allegedly lying to investigators over what had happened. 

Walker and Vaillancourt, 34, have no fixed address and were believed to be living out of their car.

Killed: Father-of-one Sgt Derek Johnson was fatally shot when he stopped alongside Walker's Volvo in Draper on September 1

Police believe that Walker ambushed Johnson while he was sat in his patrol car.

Sgt Johnson was married to his high school sweetheart Shante Sidwell with whom he had a six-year-old son Bensen.

His funeral was held last Friday where the community paid tribute to man described as a dedicated public servant.

Speaking in response to the crime, 
Vaillancourt's sister Victoria King has revealed her sister's tragic 
demise from aspiring model and TV star to drug-addled homeless woman 
reliant on her violent boyfriend.

After having her first child, Vaillancourt was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called Hereditary Angioedema which made her face, throat and limbs swell, her sister told KSL.com.

She says her sister quickly became addicted to her pain medication after suffering four strokes before the age of 30.

'It just went downhill from there,' King told the broadcaster.

'I tried to get him away from her. She chose a different path. … He was bad news from the get-go, I knew it, and the two of them combined, and a loaded gun nonetheless, and strung out on drugs.'

'We tried and tried and tried to help her but you can't help someone who won't help themself,' she added.

King last saw her sister and Walker, 35, the day before the shootings and was left startled by his behavior.

'He got out of the car and he was hyper, showing me a gun that has a laser and a machete and knives,' she said.

The couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister.

They have a daughter together who lives in full custody of her paternal grandmother.

Ms King told Salt Lake Tribune that her sister was not without remorse at what had become of her life but couldn't work her way out of the cycle of addiction.

'She would cry, ‘I never pictured my life turning out like this,’' King told the newspaper.

According to King, Walker gave Vaillancourt attention and Vaillancourt 'was attached to him at the hip'.

She says the pair have been living in and out of motels and were most recently living out of their car.

She says the couple told her they needed protection and that's why they had purchased a cache of weapons. 

'I know she was a victim, but I felt like I already lost her a long time ago. My heart is absolutely bleeding for Derek Johnson’s family,' King added in the interview.

'I just want them to know I’m sorry'.

'The streets of Draper City were made safer by Sgt. Derek Johnson who loved his job as a police officer for the Draper City Police Department,' Johnson's family wrote in his obituary.

'Understanding the risk, but wanting to protect he gave his life while on duty Sept. 1, 2013, at the age of 32.

'He was the recipient of many awards, including Life Saving Award, Distinguished Service Award, and was the 2012 Community Policing Officer of the Year. With a good nature, a sense of humor that could light up any room, attention to detail and the ability to make anyone his friend.

'He made a difference. He loved his family, hunting, running, hiking and giving service. He was always up for a good challenge,' it reads.

The police officer, promoted last year, tried to drive away after the shooting and crashed his patrol car into a field.
