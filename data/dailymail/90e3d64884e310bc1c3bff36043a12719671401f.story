An adorable Great Dane belonging to a Boston Marathon survivor has found its way back home after going missing for a day.

The 130-pound service pooch, Lydia, was placed just this week at the home of Joanna Leigh, a financial consultant in Boston who says she suffers from post-traumatic stress and a traumatic brain injury from the blasts.

She was struck by the second blast of the attacks while running into the crowd to help others.

The blast threw her into a nearby fence, leaving the woman unconscious.

Leigh was walking Lydia at Jamaica Pond on Saturday when the black Great Dane got spooked by a noise, CBS reported.

She was gone for nearly 18 hours.

'Lydia just came home all by herself,' Leigh told WCBV on Saturday afternoon.

'She looks happy and healthy.'

The dog, who is helping Leigh with mobility issues, is about 18 months old and is trained for various scenarios.

But the pup was under a lot of stress after recently moving from her trainers' place in Ipswich, about 30 miles north of Boston.
