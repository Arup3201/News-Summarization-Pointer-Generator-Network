A baroness has spoken of her ‘horror’ at discovering she could see her own garden using Google satellite imagery.

Lady O’Cathain said: ‘I was horrified the other day when I was given a certain website to look at. I could see the roses in my garden.

‘It was on a Google map or something, and I have no idea how it was taken.

Lady O’Cathain said the picture of her garden, in which she could see her roses, had been 'taken up there'

‘It was taken from up there. Obviously it was not a large aircraft, but this is happening. It did not fill me with a sense of security.’

But her comments, which were shared more than 2,000 times on Twitter, provoked concern among internet users that she appeared not to understand the difference between satellites – which capture images used by Google – and aerial photography.

Others voiced concern that the baroness, who is also on the House of Lords Digital Skills Committee, was not familiar with basic technology like Google Maps.

One Twitter user wrote: ‘Good God, these people are supposed to look out for us and they don’t know even the basics of today’s world.’

Another said: ‘Good thing she’s not involved in creating laws that touch on public policy or technology. Oh wait…’

The baroness’s comments were made during a House of Lords sub-committee meeting on the rise of personal drones which can take aerial pictures and video, and how they should be regulated.

Paul Cremin, of the Department for Transport, said there was a problem with people buying small drones (file)

Paul Cremin, of the Department for Transport, said there was a growing problem with members of the public buying small drones, often fitted with cameras, for personal use without realising they were regulated by aviation law.

He told the committee: ‘You can go into Maplins today and buy a fairly sophisticated system for about £500. The question is that when you get the box home, where, first of all, does it tell you that you are buying an aircraft, let alone anything else?

‘They are viewed in the Air Navigation Order as aircraft, and you have responsibilities under that order, but if I do not know that they are aircraft I do not know how to behave. This is a very real problem that we are aware of.’

He said the Civil Aviation Authority was calling on manufacturers to include information on aviation law and relevant data protection and privacy law with drones sold for personal use.
