Campbell Dalziel, the brother of helicopter pilot Cameron, spoke of his family's anger over the treatment of the victim' s bodies by rebels in Ukraine

The brother of a British victim of the flight MH17 disaster has spoken of his family's pain as they endure 'a waiting game' ahead of the formal identification of his body.

Cameron Dalziel, a father-of-two who had dual British and South African nationality, was one of 10 British nationals on the Malaysian Air jet that was shot down over Ukraine.

In an interview published today his brother Campbell said Cameron's wife Reine is 'absolutely distraught' since the crash on July 17.

He told the Sunday Times: 'We need closure. I know Cameron is gone. It's getting the death certificate. At the moment it's a waiting game.'

Meanwhile, it was reported today that unreleased data from the plane's black box retrieved show findings consistent with the plane's fuselage being hit multiple times by shrapnel from a missile explosion.

'It did what it was designed to do,' a European air safety official told CBS News, 'bring down airplanes.'

The official described the finding as 'massive explosive decompression.'

Mr Dalziel, who had emailed his brother on the day of the crash to make plans for a visit to South Africa, described the agony of relatives of the 298 victims who had to wait days for news as their loved ones lay in a field near the wreckage.

He contrasted the treatment of the bodies as they were brought back to the Netherlands, from where the plane had taken off.

'They had been lying in a strange field in a conflict zone, abandoned for four days while investigators were prevented from going to retrieve their dead,' he said.

'So the professionalism and dignity of how they were honoured as fallen soldiers was such a stark contrast to the days after the crash.'

Mr Dalziel said his mother had been moved to tears on seeing the poignant images of the coffins and a guard of honour for the victims.

Mr Dalziel, who had just moved to Malaysia with his family, was killed while on his way home after taking a training course. 

He had moved his family to Malaysia for 'an adventure' but also so he could work normal hours and spend time with his sons Sheldon, 14, and Cruz, 4.

Mr Dalziel's wife Reine was forced to cancel his credit cards to stop them being used after they were scavenged from the site of the plane crash, pictured, by pro-Russian rebels who looted the site  

Last week it emerged his wife had been forced to cancel her husband's credit cards to stop their fraudulent use.

Mrs Dalziel was 'stunned' by the shameful abuse of her dead husband’s belongings. 

Her brother Shane Hattingh said: 'People are abusing it in the Ukraine. They have no respect for each other, look what they’re doing. It made me angry beyond words.'

Yesterday two cargo planes flew 38 more coffins to a forensic centre in the Netherlands for identification and investigation.

There are still remains at the site, international observers have said.
