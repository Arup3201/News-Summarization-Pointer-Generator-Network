She threw her message in a bottle into the sea off the edge of Bournemouth Pier in the vain hope it might drift slowly to her aunt in Guernsey.

And when four-year-old Jasmine Hudson heard nothing from across the Channel she imagined it had been swallowed by a shark.

But incredibly, five months later, her precious note hit land in Largs Bay Beach near Adelaide, southern Australia - 10,000 miles away from where it plopped in the water in Dorset, where she was on holiday with her family.

Incredible: Four-year-old Jasmine threw her message in a bottle into the English Channel at Bournemouth and it washed up on a beach 10,000 miles away in Australia

Epic journey: The bottle took just five months to travel 10,000 miles from Bournemouth Beach all the way to Largs Bay Beach near Adelaide, southern Australia

On the other side of the world grandmother Barbara Richards was strolling along the beach when she saw the bottle, read the note and wrote back to her new young penpal in Tamworth, near Birmingham.

To travel that distance her message must have travelled at an astonishing three miles an hour - or 2.6 knots - as it bobbed its way to the other side of the globe from Dorset.

Jasmine’s mother, Louise, had warned her daughter not to get her hopes up when she wrote the message back in April, at the family home before heading to Bournemouth for their summer break.

Long haul: Five months after it left her hands she got a mysterious letter in the post from the woman who found it lying on an Australian beach

Special: Barbara Richards wrote simply: 'as fate would have it we have been introduced by a message in a bottle'

'Jasmine’s grandparents had bought her a message in a bottle kit when they went on holiday as a present,' Mrs Hudson said.

Hello from Australia! Barbara Richards found the bottle and wrote back the the four-year-old and has pledged to stay in contact

'It’s supposed to be a bit of a novelty, but we were going on holiday to Bournemouth, so we thought we’d fill it in and take it along.

'Jasmine’s aunt lives in Guernsey, so we said we’d see if we could get the bottle to float a few miles across the channel.

'Never in our wildest dreams did we ever think it would get all the way to Australia.'

Barbara Richards found the little girl’s note and wrote a reply straight back to her.

Her tender letter read: 'Dear Jasmine, As fate would have it we have been introduced to each other by your message in a bottle, Bournemouth Pier looks very interesting.

'I searched online on the computer to find out what I could, yes the pier exists and yes your address was there too.

'Your message in a bottle took five months to float up on Largs Bay Beach in South Australia.

'My name is Barbara. My brother Colin and I were walking along the beach for some exercise collecting shells and reminiscing about our childhood when I saw your little bottle.

'I scooped it up and we drove home with it where we opened it. I must share with you that I was so excited to find a message in a bottle.

'I hope my note finds you well and brings you joy to know it has landed safely into my hands on the 13th of September 2012.

Off it goes: Jasmine readies herself to throw the bottle into the water at Bournemouth in Dorset - not knowing the incredible journey it would have

Sweet: Jasmine's message in a bottle kit was given to her by her grandparents and was aimed at a Guernsey landing

'If you would like to communicate just write and let me know you received my note. Until then I wish you well, stay safe.

'Yours Truly, Barbara Richards'

And Jasmine is now planning to start 
chatting to her new friend on Skype, and is writing her a special letter
back, with some help from her mum.

Jasmine said: 'I was really excited when I got a letter from Australia.

'I had forgotten that I had thrown the message in the sea. I thought it might have been eaten by a shark.'

Happy family: Younger brother George, one, father Russ, mother Louise and Jasmine Hudson
