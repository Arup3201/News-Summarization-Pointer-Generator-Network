It was the unlikely dance craze that took Britain by storm on Saturday night.

After his incredible finish in the 10,000 metre final, Britain’s best-loved track athlete Mo Farah celebrated his stunning win with his trademark dance-move - the Mobot.

But now the bizarre movement - in which Mo arches his arms and points to the top of his head to make an ‘M’ shape - has been copied by delighted fans all over the country - including Boris Johnson.

What a Mo-ver! London Mayor Boris Johnson attempts the Mobot at a press conference this morning as a tribute to double gold medalist Mo Farah - but Seb Coe and Jeremy Hunt smile and politely decline

Despite having a late night, the Mayor of London was full of energy as he busted out the move at a press conference this morning - but dressed in a suit and shoulder pads he wasn't able to pull it off  with quite the same panache as Mo.

The request came from a journalist who asked for a 'collective Mobot' as a tribute to the Games, but chairman of the London Organising 
Committee Lord Coe and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt politely declined leaving Mr Johnson to go it alone.

It's not the first time in the last two weeks that the Mayor has hit the headlines for the way he's embraced the Games.

Last night he was caught on camera 
'dad dancing' to the Spice Girls alongside Prime Minister David Cameron 
at the Games' Closing Ceremony.

And just a few days ago the hapless 
Tory was left dangling in front of thousands of spectators after getting
stuck on a zip wire at a Games celebration event in Victoria Park.

Addressing the media Mr Johnson said he felt relief and sadness that the Games were over and said he felt a 'momentary mad desire last night not to give Jacques Rogge that flag.'

He said: 'I almost yanked it back.'

The Mayor then revealed that more than 
3,000 people had come forward to get involved with sport since the 
beginning of the Olympics.

Lord Moynihan is stepping down as chairman of the British Olympic Association (BOA).

Lord Moynihan, who helped steer Team GB to 29 golds and third place in the medal table at the London 2012 Olympics, has written to the the BOA executive board, the National Olympic Committee and the BOA advisory board to confirm his decision.

He intends to stay on as chairman until an election is held in November to find a successor.

He revealed that his priorities include a smooth handover to his successor and ensuring there is a strong sports policy so the momentum from the Games is not lost.

He said London was committed to ensuring a sporting legacy from the Games - and to providing thousands of jobs and homes.

The Mayor also said crime had dropped in London by about five per cent during the 16 day sporting festival.

Mr Johnson thanked those involved in delivering the games, including volunteers, security and transport staff.

He told the press conference in 
London: 'There are a series of exciting global sporting competitions 
(coming to London) and it is in that context we want to be expanding 
very vigorously now the number of young people who take part, we want 
people of all ages to take part in sport.

'We
have seen 3,500 applications for people to get involved in sporting 
activities since the Games began. Kate Hoey, the commissioner for sport,
will obviously be taking that forward very actively indeed.'

And Mr Johnson reminded people that the Games were not over, with the Paralympic Games due to start shortly.

He urged sports fans to look for tickets amid 'massive demand' in the wake of the events of the past fortnight.

After thanking the police, Army, armed services, volunteers and Games organisers, Mr Johnson said: 'Finally, I want to thank the people of London themselves, particularly because I think it was Londoners’ patience and kindness and imagination and enthusiasm that really got the whole thing going and helped us to deliver a great Olympics.'

Mr Johnson said the early indications were that London had already benefited economically from the Games and repeated hopes that the gains could ultimately reach £13 billion or more.

He said restaurant spending was up 20 per cent, nightclub spending was up 24 per cent and theatre ticket spending had increased by 114 per cent last week alone to £5.3 million.

Now watch Boris Johnson do the Mobot
