Craig Knapp was on holiday with his wife Lisa and their three children in Magaluf. The couple married two years ago

A British father of three has died after falling from the tenth floor of a hotel in a Spanish resort.

Craig Knapp, 31, was on a  family holiday in Magaluf, on the island of Majorca, when he fell on Monday.

Police in the resort, which is renowned for its nightlife, have launched an investigation into the tragedy.

His distraught family are waiting to fly his body back to his home city of Dundee.

Yesterday,
friends and relatives joined his wife in paying tribute to Mr Knapp – 
father to children Craig Jnr, 12, Rhys, six, and Dara, four.

Wife Lisa said she loved her husband ‘with all her heart’ and that he had lived for his family.

She added: ‘He was a much-loved man, a devoted husband and a really good dad. He will be missed by many.’

Mrs Knapp said the whole family were struggling to come to terms with their sudden loss.

‘We are still in shock and disbelief. Our main priority is to get him home and lay him to rest properly,’ she said.

The Knapps, who lived in the Whitfield area of Dundee, had been married for two years.

Yesterday, Mrs Knapp described her husband as having a ‘kind nature’ and ‘zest for life’.

Police are investigating the 31-year-old's death. He fell from a balcony on the holiday island. Family tributes to Mr Knapp say he was a loving father and keen guitarist who will be missed

She said: ‘He was a lovely man; he always wanted to make people happy. Craig lived, worked and breathed for his kids.’

She added: ‘He was just a 
happy-go-lucky guy. He was always the life and soul of the party. He 
loved playing the guitar and he always knew the right thing to say.’

Tributes were also paid to Mr Knapp, who worked as a heavy goods vehicle driver, on social networking sites.

More than 100 people joined a 
Facebook group called ‘RIP Craig Knapp’, with his friends and family 
describing him as ‘funny and genuine’ and ‘such a great guy’, adding 
that he would ‘never be forgotten’.

Others posted pictures and  video clips, along with their memories of Mr Knapp.

A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed 
that consular officials on the island had been informed of the tragedy 
in the holiday resort.

He said: ‘We were notified about the 
death of a British national in Majorca on July 8. We are standing by to 
provide consular assistance to the family.’

Majorca has seen has seen more than its fair share of tragedy in recent years.

In May last year, Charlotte Faris, 23, from Hertfordshire, became the third British tourist to die there within a month.

A coroner’s court later heard that 
she had been drinking in a nearby bar before she fell 30ft from her 
hotel balcony in Magaluf, only hours after her arrival.
