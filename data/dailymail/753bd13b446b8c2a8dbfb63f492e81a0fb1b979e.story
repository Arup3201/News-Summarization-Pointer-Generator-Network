More than 20 years ago a Christian farmer had an idea – to create a maze out of trees that would spell the words of Jesus when seen from above.

Peter Gunner chose a Bible verse, made a plan, then planted thousands of willows on a seven-acre field with the help of a few volunteers.

As they grew he carefully pruned them so their message would be clear. The words, from John 14:6, begin with ‘Jesus’ and read, with strategically-used @ signs: ‘I am the way, the truth and the life.’

Peter Gunner has planted the trees so 'Jesus I am the way the truth and the life' can be seen from above

Sowing the seeds: The father of five planned how he would plant the trees on a computer first

Trees of life: Mr Gunner planted thousands of willows and has been mowing them for decades

The father of five’s dedication went 
largely unnoticed – bar a few comments from pilots – until it was 
spotted recently on Google maps.

Labour of love: The Christian created the design on a computer before marking it out on the ground

Mr Gunner, 63, pictured, who lives 
with his wife Faith and their dog Peace near Chiddingly, East Sussex, 
said: ‘The idea just came to me one day.

'I am not even sure why I chose that part of the Bible, other than Jesus is saying a lot about himself in that passage.

'In a way the maze is a lot like life, nobody knows what it looks like from above.

'You can wander through life confused when in fact it does make sense from a different perspective.’

He only saw the words from above for 
the first time in 2005 when a police officer neighbour gave him a 
picture taken from a helicopter.

‘There are a couple of things I would
 do differently and some tweaks I would make but overall I am happy with
 it,’ Mr Gunner said.

He invites friends and people from 
the local church to use the maze, and there is a public footpath by the 
field so walkers can stumble upon his creation.

Mr Gunner added: ‘Every time I see a 
plane go over I look at it and say a little prayer. I hope somebody sees
 the maze and feels inspired.’

Friends and family use the maze and there is a public path on one side - but only the initiated know its secret

Strong belief: The farmer says he hopes someone in a plane above sees the message and is inspired by it

Perspective: Mr Gunner says the maze is like life, nobody knows what it looks like from above
