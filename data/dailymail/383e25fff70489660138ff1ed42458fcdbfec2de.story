He may have made history by helping Philae land on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

But British Rosetta Project Scientist Dr Matt Taylor is hopeless at parking and finding his car in large multistorey car parks, according to his sister.

She described him as ‘brilliant,’ but ‘lacking common sense’ just hours after this team at the European Space Agency (Esa) guided the Philae lander the duck-shaped rock after a four billion mile journey.

Dr Matt Taylor, Rosetta Project Scientist (pictured)  is one of the most important members of the team at Esa and made history by helping to land Philae on comet 67P yesterday. However, his sister has claimed that the scientist is not good at making small everyday life decisions or parking - and finding - his car in carparks

Dr Taylor, 40, is one most important people involved in the Rosetta mission and yesterday became a Twitter sensation because of his unorthodox appearance, involving bright shirts and an array of body art - including a tattoo on his leg of the space probe landing on the comet, which he got in January.

The father-of-two from Manor Park in north east London now lives in the Netherlands with his wife Leanne and children Lily, 13 and Harry, 11.

His sister Maxine, 39 told The Evening Standard that he is a genius but is sometimes so indecisive when making real-life decisions that he is useless.

‘He gets so involved in everything that sometimes common sense goes out the window - like losing the car in the car park, silly things.

‘If you go out with him you end up going round and round looking for a car parking space...he doesn’t want to make decisions.’

His wife admitted that the scientist is terrible at following directions and has lost track of where he has parked his car on many occasions.

While there was jubilation in mission control yesterday when Philae touched down on the comet’s surface, Esa scientists are now concerned about the future of the  probe after it was revealed that it is likely stuck in a cave on the surface of the comet - and it may also be on its side.

The scientist was so positive that the mission to land on the comet would be successful that he got the triumphant moment of landing permanently etched on his body (pictured). Dr Taylor became a Twitter sensation thanks to his flamboyant dress sense and colourful body art

Esa scientists are concerned about the future of the Philae probe after it was revealed that the probe is likely stuck in a cave on the surface of the comet - and it may also be lying on its side.

With limited access to sunlight, and only a maximum of 30 hours of charge in its battery, scientists now face a race against time to get useful data from the probe before it dies - or find a way to recharge its solar panels and keep Philae alive.

If you look at the images we have at the moment, it looks like Philae is resting against a very irregular rock’, mission director Paolo Ferri told MailOnline.

‘There is some speculation about it being in a hole…honestly, we have no idea, because we haven’t seen all the images.

‘But what is more important is the attitude [angle] of the lander, and the clock is ticking for us to find this out.’

In a press conference in french Esa also added: 'We are in a kind of cave, not a very flat area.' And they said that the probe has access to 90 minutes of sunlight every 12 hours - which might be enough to keep it alive.

With limited access to sunlight and only a maximum of 30 hours of charge in its battery, scientists now face a race against time to get useful data from the probe before it dies - or find a way to recharge its solar panels and keep Philae alive.

Experts are now waiting with baited breath for the results of critical tests but said Philae is receiving a good signal and has already sent an image back from the comet.

Scientists hope that by analysing the comet’s surface, it will offer fresh insights into the origins of Earth and the solar system.

Dr Taylor’s sister revealed that the whole family is ‘immensely proud’ of Dr Taylor’s part in the 25 year mission.

His daughter sent him a message on Twitter that reads: ‘Dad! You’re famous! Haha how are you doing? Xx’ to which the scientist replied: ‘Just want to come home n see you lot xxxx’.

He has become the poster-child of the ambitious mission after several video appearances wearing flamboyant shirts, showing off his tattoos.

He was so sure that the mission to land on the comet would be successful that he had the moment permanently etched on his body in January.

He told BBC Breakfast: ‘I'm incredibly confident that we're going to nail this landing. I'm confident enough to have it drawn on my body.’

Dr Taylor, the son of a brick layer, was reportedly told to cover his tattoos at media events in the past, but his appearance seems only to have increased his popularity.

Twitter users praised Dr Taylor for being ‘a proper cool scientist’ and ‘definitely not boring’ after he appeared on the European Space Agency live stream and BBC Breakfast wearing a multi-coloured shirt emblazoned with illustrations of glamorous women, which he teamed with shorts, which showed off his tattoos. 

To convince his new team of his dedication, Dr Taylor promised that if Rosetta woke up from its hibernation, he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event. This video shows the creation of the tattoo

One Twitter user wrote: 'Dr Matt Taylor is what every scientist should look like - rad shirt, sleeve tattoos. Rad,' while another said: ‘Matt Taylor causing thousands of people to choke on their cornflakes this morning.’

Dr Taylor studied at the University of Liverpool and Imperial College London, winning a PhD in space plasma physics

He has worked at the European Space Agency since 2005 and was given the top scientific job on the mission in the summer of 2013.

The role was a real change from his previous job, which was studying the physics of the northern lights, The Guardian reported. 

Professor Mark McCaughrean, senior science advisor at ESA, who appointed Dr Taylor, said that he took a chance on the young scientist as he would have to come up to speed with the mission quickly and gain the trust of older experts who had been working at ESA for decades.

To convince them of his dedication, Dr Taylor promised that if Rosetta woke up from its hibernation, he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event.

In January this happened, and a school friend turned tattoo artist etched a reminder of the ambitious mission on his leg.

In his profile on the Rosetta project website, Dr Taylor says: ‘The opportunity to work on Rosetta was huge and I cannot begin to describe the excitement associated with this mission. It really is just so cool.’

Esa has successfully made contact with the Philae lander after it separated from the Rosetta spacecraft this morning at 08.35am GMT. It is now heading towards the comet and is expected to attempt to land on the surface at 4pm GMT. Pictured right is Paolo Ferri, Head of Mission Operations, celebrating making contact

Rosetta has chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years in what has been described as 'the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever'. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, it is now positioned in an orbit 19 miles (30 km) away from 67P
