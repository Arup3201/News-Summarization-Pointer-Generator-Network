The FBI have dubbed a suspected bank robber the 'Good Grammar Bandit' for leaving typed and punctuated demand notes with perfect spelling.

FBI Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force officials said the suspect has robbed four banks in Denver, Colorado in the last week.

Surveillance photos shows the alleged thief entering the banks and handing the teller a demand note - described as perfectly crafted - before fleeing on foot. It is not clear if he was armed.

The FBI said in a statement that the alleged mugger is about six-feet-tall, slender and aged in his 30s.

Surveillance images from the robberies show the man wearing a hooded sweatshirt, a cap and sunglasses.

The four robberies occurred on Wednesday at a Northglenn TCF bank, Thursday at a Chase Bank in Westminster, Sunday at the Broomfield TCF Bank and Monday at a Chase Bank in Thornton.

The FBI would not disclose how much money was taken or when the demand letters would be released.

'Those letters are evidence in the investigation. We are not able to release them just yet,' FBI spokesman Dave Joly said in an email to MailOnline.
