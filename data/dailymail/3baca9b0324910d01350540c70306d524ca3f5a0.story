A week in which little has gone right for Frankie Dettori took a welcome turn for the better when he was booked for John Gosden-trained Forever Now in Saturday’s Ladbrokes St Leger.

The mount on the 16-1 shot was available after Gosden’s stable jockey William Buick opted to partner the trainer’s Derby third Romsdal in the final Classic of the season.

Dettori’s booking came on the day Leger favourite Kingston Hill was scratched from Sunday’s Prix Niel at Longchamp by trainer Roger Varian.

The French option had been an insurance policy should the ground become too quick at Doncaster but Kingston Hill now looks certain to run in the Leger.

Dettori’s mount Forever Now has been regarded as a long-term Leger project by four-time winner Gosden, who teamed up with Dettori to win the Classic with Shantou in 1996.

Dettori, jocked off Arc favourite Treve on Monday before being beaten on £5.25million Naamah 24 hours later, said: ‘I don’t

know too much about Forever Now but I have won the Leger for John and he seems to do well in the race.

‘A mile and six furlongs is unknown territory for everybody. It is a good spare to have so I am quite pleased.’

Kings Fete, one of two Leger runners for Sir Michael Stoute, has been clipped into 12-1 (from 16s) by the sponsors in the

anticipation that three-time champion Ryan Moore will be confirmed as his jockey.

Moore, successful on Godolphin’s Clon Brulee in Wednesday’s Park Hill Hospital Stakes, is in for a busy weekend riding in three countries in 24 hours.
