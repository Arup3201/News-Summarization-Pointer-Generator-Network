Chinese tourists have found themselves in more hot water in Thailand – where they have a strained relationship with locals – after a group was photographed washing their feet in public sinks.

The photos are circulating on Thai and Chinese social media networks, leading to outrage in Thailand as locals insist the holidaymakers have committed a cultural faux pas.

The images of tourists cleaning their feet and sandals inside a bathroom on the island of Phi Phi were snapped just weeks after Thailand’s government released an etiquette guide for Chinese holidaymakers following a series of incidents.

Locals said the visitors committed a cultural sin by cleaning their feet and sandals in  hand basins

In response to the outrage, authorities on the holiday island are keen to inform Chinese tourists that they are committing a cultural sin by washing their feet in hand basins, Phuketwan reported.

The news website said locals avoid cleaning their feet in places where they wash the rest of their bodies, except in the shower.

An island official told NetEase, a Chinese media agency, that the holidaymakers’ actions were ‘inappropriate’ and that notices will be posted in public bathrooms to discourage the behaviour.

Thailand is a popular destination for millions of Chinese tourists every year, but locals have expressed frustration and outrage in response to the actions of a handful of visitors.

Last month, Thailand’s tourist board announced that it would be handing out etiquette manuals to Chinese tourists who were visiting during the Chinese New Year.

The relationship between Thais and Chinese tourists has been strained by a series of high-profile incidents

The manuals outlined how the holidaymakers are expected to behave while they visit Thailand.

They were created after the Thai government received complaints from locals, who accused Chinese visitors of defecating in public, causing traffic accidents with reckless driving, and defacing tourist attractions.

Chinese tourists were temporarily banned from even entering Wat Rong Khun, the Buddhist White Temple in Chiang Rai, after complaints that they had ruined the toilets.
