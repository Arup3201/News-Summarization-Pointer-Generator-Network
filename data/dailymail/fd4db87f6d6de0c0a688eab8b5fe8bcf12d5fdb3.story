After only a few hours in the Celebrity Big Brother House, Rhian Sugden opened up about her well documented friendship with married TV presenter Vernon Kay.

The glamour model confided in Jasmine Lennard about her friendship with the star and explained how her life had been ruined by him and their text messaging.

She said: 'We spoke as friends. We were just friends – but we spoke too much. I never sent a sex text. I never sold a story.'

Confession time: Rhian Sugden confided in Jasmine Lennard about her alleged affair with Vernon Kaye

Talk of the town: Vernon Kay, pictured last month with wife Tess Daly, reportedly sent sex texts to Rhian

The two girls debated whether it is okay to text a married man and Jasmine declared: 'It was your fault at the point you knew he was attracted to you.

'People are not going to feel sorry for you. They will feel sorry for her.'

The 25-year-old discussed how tough her life became in the aftermath of the phone scandal and how she couldn't even go out without being attacked.

It's good to talk: Jasmine Lennard asked the glamour model several questions about the incident and Rhian answered them all

Rhian told Jasmine that she had been spat at and bottled in nightclubs even though she had done nothing wrong.

Kay, who has been married to TV sweetheart Tess Daly since 2003, has two daughters Pheobe Elizabeth, 7, and three-year-old Amber Isabella.

After the pair's 'friendship'  was exposed Kay issued a grovelling apology saying: 'I've been an idiot and I've let my family down.'

In last night's show Rhian explained: 'We were from the same area and I was in with his family and I knew his brother, but he admitted in the paper that he got drunk and sent sex texts to five girls.

'I've been proper screwed over. He admitted that he sent the text messages and yet I'm the one that has been labelled a sex texter.'

Shock horror: Rhian spoke to Danica about her earlier conversation and admitted she was surprised by the questioning

When asked if their relationship was sexual and if she fancied him, she said: 'He's a good looking guy but it was never like that at all.

'I read somewhere that Samantha wrote an article saying she didn't trust men because of me.'

Jasmine was stunned at the revelation and said: 'You have been very diplomatic because if someone had written that about me it would have been on.'

Watch out: The two girls discussed how dangerous Jasmine is and Rhian said she would be sacred to cross her

Bad girl: Jasmine has made quite an impression on the other housemates already with her honest and straight opinions

Later in the evening, however, Rhian spoke to Danica Thrall about her reservations of Jasmine following their conversation in the garden.

'She asked me a lot of questions earlier about Vernon. I wouldn't mess with her.

'I think what you see is what you get with Jasmine.'

In the line of fire: Jasmine said she would have said something to Samantha Brick if she had written about her
