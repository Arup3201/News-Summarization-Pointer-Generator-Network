Season three of TLC's MY 600lb Life makes its debut next month, and its first episode will reunite viewers with the stars of season two - some of whom have been more successful than others in regards to their continued weight-loss. 

James, 39, from Frankston, Texas, lost 350lbs from his former 750lb bulk and found love at long last after undergoing gastric bypass surgery last year.

He was a single man when TLC first started following him, and had lost both his father and his older sister to obesity-related illnesses. New photos from the upcoming season show James seemingly admiring an engagement ring on the finger of his new girlfriend Summer.

Chuck, 46, from Beaumont, Texas, lost 420lbs from his former 700lb frame following his appearance on season two of the show.

Chuck became morbidly obese in 2006 after his wife was murdered. He later remarried and adopted a son, but the excess fluid in his legs as a result of his weight meant he was dangerously close to requiring an amputation.

New photos show Chuck renewing his vows with his long-suffering wife Nissa, something he promised to do at the end of season two.

Zsalynn, a 44-year-old wife and mother-of-one, managed to lose 280lb following her gastric bypass surgery, almost half of her former body weight.

Photos from the upcoming season show her working out at the gym and on an active day out with her daughter Hannah.

Mom: Zsalynn dubbed herself 'the fat girl rock star', and her husband loved her figure, but it had left her almost immobile and unable to care for her then-nine-year-old (left). She has since embraced a more active lifestyle (right)

Zsalynn weighed close to 600lbs when she appeared on the show earlier this year. She was accustomed to a life being flown around the world by men who paid to be in the company of large women.

Dubbed 'the fat girl rock star', Zsalynn's husband loved her figure, but it had left her almost immobile and unable to care for her then-nine-year-old daughter.

In an episode from the last season, she admitted: 'My husband, he loves me but he loves fat women so he’s really sad. He’s sad because the woman he married is not who I am now.'

Christina, 24, from South Haven, Mississippi, was originally 670lbs and so miserable, she was suicidal. Christina, who was cared for by her husband Zach and her 'enabling' mother, was confined to a wheelchair.

She managed to shed 266lbs following her surgery and is able to sleep in the same bed as Zach for the first time in years. A newly released photo shows Christina debuting a new red hairstyle and working out. 

Tara, a 36-year-old single mother-of-two, weighed 610lbs; a result of being raped in her 20s and turning to food for comfort. She described herself in the last season of the show as a 'prisoner' in her own body.

Dramatic: Tara, a 36-year-old single mother-of-two, previously weighed 610lbs (left) but lost 280lbs over the course of season two, and is now no longer immobile (right)

Tara lost 280lbs over the course of season two, and is now no longer immobile.

A new photo shows her, having lost half her body weight, reclining on the couch with one of her sons, a large Coca-Cola looming on the side table.

Penny, 46, from Elkton, Maryland, weighed over 400lbs at the start of the show and had spent the past four years living in her hospital bed, struggling with her food addiction.

Penny's current state is unclear. She is pictured in an outtake from the new season sitting with her son on her lap and wearing a nebulizer.

Following Penny's gastric bypass surgery in season two, she failed to lose any weight at all, despite being put on a 1,200 calorie-a-day diet.

New look: Paula, 39, from Atlanta, Georgia declared at the start of her weight-loss journey (left) that she was 'a monster' and a burden to her children, but that food was her 'happiness.' Pictured (right) after her 154lbs weight loss

Seven months later, having returned to her old ways, Penny had actually gained weight, and her doctors told her there was nothing more they could do for her.

Paula, 39, from Atlanta, Georgia declared at the start of her weight-loss journey that she was 'a monster' and a burden to her children, but that food was her 'happiness.'

Having lost her husband from obesity-related complications in 2012, Paula was terrified that her four children would be orphaned if she followed him to an early grave.

Paula's gastric bypass surgery initially failed to curb her weight, since she was still gorging on fast-food and refusing to exercise. 

She's up! Olivia, 47, from Cicero, Illinois, tipped the scales at 600lbs and had been living in the basement of her parents' house for two years, confined to a wheelchair (left). She lost 240lbs following her surgery (right)

Sticking with it: Olivia, pictured before her weight loss (left) also had 40lbs of excess skin removed, claiming she had been 'reborn.' Pictured (right) cooking up a storm 

A year later, however, Paula managed to lose 154lbs and is seen in new photos dressed in workout gear.

Olivia, 47, from Cicero, Illinois, tipped the scales at 600lbs and had been living in the basement of her parents' house for two years, relying on an oxygen tank to breathe.

She lost 240lbs following her surgery and then had 40lbs of excess skin removed, claiming she had been 'reborn.' 

New photos show Olivia cooking and playing basketball without her oxygen tank in tow.
