A campaign by hardline Islamists to take control of state schools was laid bare yesterday.

Revealing the shocking extent to which strict Muslim practices are being imposed on pupils and teachers alike, the chief inspector of schools said the plotters used ‘fear and intimidation’ against their opponents.

Sir Michael Wilshaw said the aim of the ‘Trojan Horse’ campaign was to impose a ‘narrow faith-based ideology’ on schools in Birmingham.

Shocking: The damning report by Sir Michael Wilshaw heavily condemned the practices of senior staff, including Monzoor Hussain, assistant headteacher at Park View School, who ran assemblies on Ramadan

Music was banned at one primary, raffles and tombolas were axed from fetes for being unIslamic and boys were forced to change for PE in a store cupboard to preserve their modesty.

One primary spent £32,000 on a five-star trip to Saudi Arabia from which non-Muslim pupils were barred.

Children as young as six at the same school were told that Western women were ‘white prostitutes’.

Launching long-awaited reports on 21 schools, Sir Michael said the widespread conspiracy had involved  fundamentalists infiltrating governing bodies. 

Centre of scandal: Park View School was downgraded from 'outstanding' to 'inadequate'

Governors had ‘exerted inappropriate influence’ on schools leading to enforced segregation of boys and girls in some classes and a narrowing of the curriculum.

The Ofsted reports – and a separate 
set of Department for Education investigations – make many other 
revelations including that teachers attempted to vet the script of a 
nativity play. The reports were issued as: 

Involved: The Golden Hillock School and Nansen Primary School were both branded 'inadequate' as a result of the inspections

Change needed: Governors
 at Satley School were accused of  'refusing to accept that the school 
is in a state of crisis' while governors at Oldknow Academy used the 
school's budget to subsidise a trip to Saudi Arabia

Sir Michael revealed that Mr Gove had blocked his request for the right to carry out snap inspections.

Ofsted’s three-month inquiry resulted in five schools being put into special measures, with a sixth having its ‘failing’ verdict reaffirmed.

Eleven other schools were found to ‘require improvement’ while one was rated good and a further three outstanding.

In an advice note to Mr Gove, Sir Michael warned that in some schools, heads had been forced out by bullying governors. 

Opposed: Tahir Alam - alleged ring-leader in the so-called plot to enforce a hardline agenda at the schools - has described the allegations as 'a witch-hunt'

Failings: The practices of Shahid Akmal, the Chairman of governors at Nansen, and Waseem Yaqub, Chair of Governors at the Al-Hijrah school, have also been questioned by the report

One head was so worried about the consequences of whistle-blowing he or she insisted on meeting inspectors in a supermarket car park.

‘Some headteachers reported that there has been an organised campaign to target certain schools in Birmingham in order to alter their character and ethos,’ Sir Michael said.

‘A culture of fear and intimidation has developed in some of the schools since their previous inspection.

‘Staff and some head teachers variously described feeling “intimidated”, “undermined” or “bullied” by governors, and sometimes by senior staff, into making changes they did not support.’

Some governors were ‘trying to impose and promote a narrow faith-based ideology in what are non-faith schools’.

Sir Michael suggested the governors were part of a network, noting that ‘some of these governors serve on several schools’.

Headteachers had ‘identified governors who are highly influential across several of the schools that were inspected’.Claims of a co-ordinated campaign initially surfaced in the letter that triggered the Ofsted and Government investigations, which purported to describe a ‘Trojan Horse’ operation to infiltrate governing bodies and push through a strict Islamic agenda.

Sir Michael last night piled further pressure on Mr Gove over his handling of the extremism threat with the disclosure that he asked for the ability to carry out snap inspections two years ago but was blocked by the Education Secretary.

The claim, in a BBC Newsnight interview, came hours after Mr Gove announced a wide-ranging inquiry into the way his department dealt with warnings of extremist influence on schools in a bid to calm a damaging Cabinet row over the issue.

Russell Hobby, of teaching union NAHT, said: ‘We should take comfort in the willingness of staff to resist intimidation and put their careers on the line to protect their students.

‘The reports reveal weaknesses in oversight, governance and support. They show that staff with concerns did not know where to turn.’

Governors at three schools rated inadequate have hit back at Ofsted’s findings, claiming they were a product of an ‘Islamophobic witch-hunt’.

Speaking on behalf of Park View Trust, vice-chairman David Hughes said that its three schools – Park View Academy, Golden Hillock and Nansen Primary – were wrongly rated inadequate and had no links to extremism.

He said the schools ‘wholeheartedly’ rejected Ofsted’s findings and said they would launch a legal challenge. Lee Donaghey, assistant principal at Park View, insisted the schools were free from strict Islamic practices.

David
 Hughes, the vice chair of Park View Education Trust at the centre of 
the scandal, this morning furiously rejected Ofsted's findings and vowed
 to fight the decision to put his schools in special measures

‘It is simply not true that the school does not do enough to protect our pupils from the risks of extremism,’ he said.

Under pressure: Razwan Faraz the deputy head at Nansen

‘This is a normal state school like thousands of others across Britain, 98 per cent of our pupils just happen to be Muslims – British Muslims.’

In a letter to Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw, the trust said criticism of Park View was ‘laced with Islamophobic sentiment’ and asked for a re-inspection of the schools ‘under a climate that is far removed from the fallacious insinuations of radical and extremist plots that have provided the context for the current set of inspections’.

Trust chairman Tahir Alam – alleged ring-leader in the so-called plot to enforce a hardline agenda at the schools – has described the allegations as ‘a witch-hunt’.

But a group of female pupils at Park View backed Ofsted’s findings, saying yesterday: ‘Our school deserves this... for the things that it has done.

‘Our school is too extreme but not in a terrorist way. They are strict with us and they use religion as an excuse. Basically they don’t let boys and girls mix.

‘If they see you talking to a boy they will call your parents or come to your house, which they did to a lot of people.’

The teenage girls, who didn’t want to be identified, told Sky News that pupils were afraid to speak out about the school.

teaching was being introduced. In a 2008 picture boys and girls are
