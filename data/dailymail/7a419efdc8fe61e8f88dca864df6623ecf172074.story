Known for its innovation, Dubai is set to ramp it up even further with the building of a Museum of the Future.

The flashy Gulf city with a skyline that looks like something out of a science fiction film is embracing its love of all things new with its now customary ambitious plans.

The £89 million ($136 million) museum in Dubai will showcase innovations in design and technology in fields such as transportation, health and education, said Emirati minister of cabinet affairs Mohammed Gergawi.

Dubai's new plans for the Museum of the Future is set to cost around £90 million to erect and will be opened in 2017

The venue is expected to open in 2017.

The curving, oblong - and of course futuristic-looking - building will feature poetry written by the Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who is also the Emirati prime minister. 

Mr Gergawi said the museum aims to change its exhibits every six months to keep pace with changing technology, with a goal 'to always be 10 years ahead of today'.

It will play the part of attraction and research facility, decked throughout with the latest in technology including 3D elements.

There will also be poetry within the walls by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai.

The ring represents what we know today, while the hole represents all that is unknown, according to architect Shaun Killa

Lifts in the building resemble futuristic time capsules, and there isn't expected to be any windows in the venue, meaning air conditioning will be extensive.

The design has been constructed by architect Shaun Killa, who is based in Dubai.

The Dubai Chronicle describes how Killa states the 'ring like solid element of the structure represents what we know today while the hole stands for the unknown. 

The project is set to cost around £89million ($136 million) and is part of the development of investments on innovation and technology.

The authorities in Dubai are already finalising plans on the development of 'Aladdin City.' 

Comprising six towers, all connected by moving walkways, the development is inspired by the tales of Aladdin from the Middle Eastern folk Tale The Arabian Nights and the more modern Disney blockbuster.

The towers are said to be similar in design to the genie lamp, and are set to shimmer golden in the

The highest of the towers will measure 34 storeys; the development will spread some 1,500 feet along Dubai Creek, encompassing 4,000 acres in total.

The area is a popular spot for old wooden fishing boats, and maintains an air of tradition about it; the new plans will fall outside the area set to be named a UNESCO World Heritage site.
