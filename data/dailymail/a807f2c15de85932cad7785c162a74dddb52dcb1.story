Brooke Butler who was strapped in to her £40 car seat in the back of the car escaped without a scratch when her father's car turned over

A tiny baby who survived a horrific car crash which destroyed the vehicle she was travelling in was found laughing while still strapped in her seat.

Brooke Butler, 10-months-old, and her parents, Tom, 25, and fiancée Kirsty Hobley, 20, were driving home on an A-road when Mr Butler swerved to avoid a pheasant near the village of Pillerton Priors in Warwickshire.

The family’s V-reg Rover 400 toppled onto its side as it careered across the road before hitting a grass verge and falling back onto all four wheels.

Brooke, who was strapped in her £40 car seat in the back of the vehicle escaped without a scratch.

Instead of crying as she was hauled out of the smashed-up car, the youngster 
burst into fits of giggles as her panicking parents tried to escape the 
wreckage.

The crash happened on May 2 as the family travelled from Banbury, Oxfordshire, to 
their home in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire.

The young 
family were taken from the scene on the A422 to Warwick Hospital but were discharged that night 
and housewife Ms Hobley is now recovering from her cuts and bruises.

‘Of
 course I was always told to hit the things but instinct took over and 
when I saw those eyes I turned the wheel. Being a new driver I turned too sharply,' said Mr Butler.

Write-off: Paramedics and firemen rushed to the scene and cut Tom free from the vehicle following the crash on May 2

‘It went up on the driver’s side which is the side my daughter was on in the back.

‘The car righted itself but I couldn’t open my door so climbed out of the window and managed to yank the back door open.

‘I got my daughter out and as soon as I picked her up she started giggling. It shocked me completely.

‘Even with her laughing I still wanted Brooke checked over and everything, in case of anything internal.

‘But she was completely unharmed and even fell asleep on the way to the hospital in the ambulance.

‘We spent £40 on a car seat and it is the best £40 I have ever spent in my life.

‘It definitely saved our daughter’s life.’

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed two ambulances, a rapid response vehicle and a paramedic area support officer attended the scene.

He said: ‘Crews were called to a single vehicle road traffic collision. On arrival at the scene, crews found a car that was facing the wrong direction on the carriageway.

‘The driver, a man in his 20s, was treated for a chest injury believed to have been caused by the seat belt.

Brooke, 10-months-old, was unhurt despite sitting in the back of the written-off family car

‘The front seat passenger, a woman in her 20s, had sustained neck, back and leg injuries.

‘Due to the nature of her injuries the woman was fully immobilised and extricated from the vehicle, with the assistance of the fire brigade.

‘A baby, who was restrained in a child seat in the rear of the vehicle, was assessed at the scene and fortunately had sustained no obvious injuries.

'All three occupants of the car were conveyed to Warwick Hospital for further assessment and treatment.’
