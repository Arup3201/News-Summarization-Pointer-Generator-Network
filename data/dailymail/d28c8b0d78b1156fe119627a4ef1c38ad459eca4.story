Plans to extend a riverside hotel in historic Cambridge have been rejected for a third time - following a campaign spearheaded by Stephen Hawking.

The Double Tree by Hilton had its plans to build 31 extra bedrooms and a new leisure centre rejected last year, following a similar idea turned down in 2010.

The latest scheme for the hotel, which sits on Sheep's Green and Coe Fen by the river Cam in Cambridge, involved building a fourth floor to one block, providing 16 new rooms.

However, planners rejected the expansion plans, which campaigners claimed would, according to this artist's impression would reduce the amount of river frontage available to members of the public 

Ability Hotels, which owns the Doubletree, said they planned to then convert the hotel's leisure centre into 13 bedrooms, while retaining a small gym.

But it has already been recommended by planning officers at Cambridgeshire County Council that the plans should be rejected.

Members of the public voiced concerns about the potential loss of leisure facilities, commenting these are 'well used' and that the new design is 'unattractive'.

Campaigners including the A Brief History of Time author and comedian Griff Rhys Jones argued that a new build would ruin the historic view of Cambridge University.

Cllr Sian Reid said: 'I am delighted this application is being recommended for refusal by council officers. The loss of the leisure club would be a loss for the community.'

Jane Singleton, chairman of the Resident's Association of Old Newnham which led the campaign against the first two applications, said she was absolutely 'delighted'.

She said: 'There are so many grounds for refusal, including taking away the leisure centre from over 700 Cambridge residents.

'Damage is being done to a particularly unique and beautiful area of Cambridge.'

Thirty-seven mothers who take their children to swim in the pool signed a petition against the move.

But designer Mark Savin, of Bury St Edmunds-based MLT Architects, said at the time the proposals would have no impact on views from Sheep's Green and Coe Fen - a key issue in previous refusals.

He said: 'We have endeavoured to take on board the previous comments made by both the committee and the appeal officer and we have looked to address them in a constructive and sensitive fashion with revised proposals.'

The proposals would also get rid of a large and visually prominent glazed pyramid for a transition to a single storey structure - something which English Heritage welcomed.

When it launched its third application, the hotel argued removing the leisure centre's pyramidal roof would help the development to blend in.

Hotel officials said the expansion was needed because it was running at 'maximum capacity' - but the plan was rejected anyway.
