The family of the 53-year-old Colorado man found safe five days after he went missing during a Denver Broncos game have revealed that he 'had some sort of breakdown' and is currently recovering from his ordeal.

The Denver Police Department tweeted just before 11pm on Tuesday that 53-year-old Paul Kitterman had been found alive more than 110 miles south of Denver in the city of Pueblo, and that no foul play is suspected.

'Right now we are still unsure what happened to Paul. We know he is very tired.

'We are not certain of what has happened but we know Paul had some sort of breakdown,' said stepson Jarod Tonneson and friend Tia Bakke in a statement to ABC News.

Reached by phone, Kitterman's father, Allen, told MailOnline that his son was 'catching up on his sleep.'

'He's back home with his friends. We have not spoken to him but we are glad he's OK,' he said.

'We are trying to let him sleep, he's catching up on his sleep. I appreciate your concern.'

Earlier on Wednesday Kitterman's family had released a statement saying the 53-year-old man was 'in a fragile state, both physically and mentally.'

'At this time, even family and friends do not have the while story. They are respecting Paul's wishes for personal space and time to process the events of the past five days.'

Colorado police have revealed that Kitterman disposed of his hat emblazoned with the Broncos' logo before embarking on a 112-mile journey to Pueblo last Thursday.

Pueblo police said they found Kitterman coherent outside a Kmart store after a citizen spotted him, Fox Denver reports.  

He reportedly told police that he wanted to escape to some place warm. Police there said he appeared to be in good health, and has been put up in a hotel to await the arrival of his grown stepson, whom he had left alone during halftime at Mile High Stadium five days earlier. 

According to police, they got a call from a family friend Tuesday saying they had picked up Kitterman at a Salvation Army and took him to a Rodeway Inn in Pueblo, but by the time officers arrived at the motel the man was gone.

Soon after, police received a call from the owner of Benfatti Furniture who spotted Kitterman and recognized him as the missing man from news reports. The 53-year-old was picked up next to a Kmart store near the Pueblo Mall.

Kitterman, who had no car and no cellphone on him, revealed that he walked and hitchhiked from Denver to Pueblo located 112 miles away because 'he'd had his fill of football,' reported USA Today. 

The father also allegedly told police that he enjoyed taking walks, reported the station KOAA. With only about $50 in his pocket, the construction warm said he slept in trees and bushes along the way. 

Kitterman 'even mentioned disposing of his Broncos hat as he did not want to be recognized,' police told NBC News. 

According to police in Pueblo, the divorced dad was surprised to learn that his disappearance has made national headlines.

Kitterman, who had been described by his family as someone who is not comfortable with technology, told officers that he had not seen any television since he took off from the stadium. 

Earlier in the day Tuesday, Kitterman's family had a scare when police found the body of a middle-aged man near train tracks in the vicinity of the football stadium, but it was quickly determined that it was not the missing dad.

Paul Kitterman's family have released a statement on Facebook thanking everyone for offering them support and asking the public and the media to respect their privacy.

'The family is happy to report Paul has been found and they are now with him and he is safe,' read the status update posted Tuesday night. 

Safe and well - but where was he? Denver Police said that no foul play was suspected in Kitterman's disappearance. They referred all further questions to the man's family

Denver Police Sgt. Steve Warneke said that no criminal charges are expected.

'All we were trying to do was make sure he was unharmed, and he was,' Warneke said. 'So at that point, we're finished." Police referred all other questions to Kitterman's family. 

Kitterman was last seen on Thursday when his stepson left him at halftime to use the restroom. 

On Monday night, Denver police revealed that a witness saw Kitterman inside the stadium during the third quarter, but it remains unknown where the man went after the game.

Jarod Tonneson, Kitterman’s stepson, as well as his friends, have publicly criticized  investigators for allegedly not doing enough to locate the missing man.

'I think they should take us more seriously,' Tonneson said during an interview on Fox News Tuesday morning.

Tia Bakke, Kitterman's friend who took him to the fateful game on Thursday, told MailOnline Monday: 'He's now been missing for four days and we have had absolutely no leads whatsoever. But police don't consider it a priority.

'They say he is an adult and there is no sign of foul play so there is nothing much they can do,' she added. 'I am trying to maintain a positive, hopeful attitude, but I am very, very worried.' 

Kitterman, who is unmarried and lives alone in Kremmling, was at his first ever professional football game when he vanished. 

Bakke and her boyfriend Jay Yust - for whom Kitterman has worked for the last 10 years - had invited him last-minute to go to Thursday's crunch AFC West face-off against the San Diego Chargers along with his 21-year-old stepson, Jarod Tonneson.

In their haste, Kitterman forgot his cellphone, took no credit cards and very little cash.

Still, Kitterman had memorized his friends' phone numbers and would have found ways to reach out if he wanted to leave.

Mystery: Kitterman - pictured with Jarod at the game - did not have his cell phone or his credit cards with him when he vanished, Bakke said  

'We are regulars, we are not season ticket holders, but this was the fourth Broncos game we have been to this season, and we have taken other friends with us before,' said Bakke. 'But Paul had never been to a game.'

The friends couldn't get seats together so Bakke and Yust sat in one section of the Sports Authority Field at Mile High while Kitterman and his son went to another, section number 230.

The foursome met up at halftime when the Broncos were leading 14-7 — but that is the last time that Kitterman, who works on Yust's MY Ranch in Kremmling, Colorado, was seen.

'He was super-excited about the game. It was the first time he had been and the Broncos were ahead and playing well,' Bakke, 24, told MailOnline. 'Jarod needed to use the restroom and we left Paul waiting outside for him - it couldn't have been more than 10 feet from where we had been standing.'

But when Jarod came out, his father was nowhere to be found so he went back to his seat in the south bleachers to watch the second half of the game, assuming he would soon rejoin him.

Back home: Bakke told MailOnline that Kitterman said that it was uncharacteristic of him to disappear. She said he's 'extremely reliable. Paul is the most trustworthy person you could ever wish to meet'

When the game ended in a 35-21 Bronco victory around 9.30 pm, Bakke called Tonneson telling him she and her 30-year-old boyfriend were waiting at Gate 8 ready for the two-hour drive back to Kremmling.

'He said he was waiting for Paul and asked me if he was with us, I said "no, I thought he was with you."'

For nearly three frantic hours the trio searched the 13-year-old, 76,000-capacity stadium with no luck. They called the police, local hospitals, even jails and detox facilities in the hope that someone could give them a lead.

Tonneson told Denver's Fox affiliate, KDVR-TV he and his friends had looked in 'parking lots, trees, bushes, anywhere we could think of'. 

Farm hand: Kitterman worked at a ranch owned by the friends he went to the game with. Bakke said: 'He would hate the fuss that is growing up around his disappearance'

Eventually they left for the long journey home, hoping against hope that Paul would be waiting for them when they returned to Kremmling. Bakke called the frustrating days following the game 'the longest, most miserable days of her life'. 

According to his son, Paul had four or five beers in the course of a four-hour span, not enough to become disoriented.

Tia Bakke told MailOnline that Kitterman has worked for her boyfriend for nearly a decade and has always been extremely reliable. 

'Paul is the most trustworthy person you could ever wish to meet,' she said. 'He would hate the fuss that is growing up around his disappearance. Paul is just not the type of person who would do something like this for attention.

'He would never deliberately let anyone worry about him, that is just not who he is,' she added. 'He never wants stress or heartache or anything like that. He is the type of person that if you are having a bad day will do anything he can to be there for you.
