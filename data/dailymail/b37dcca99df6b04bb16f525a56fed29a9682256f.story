R. Kelly has finally spoken out about his 14-year-old child Jaya announcing he is now transgender and has changed his name to Jay.

The brave teen made the announcement on his social media two weeks ago and his singer father, who has been silent on the issue, finally addressed the revelation this week  saying: 'You don't really wanna open it up by saying that my daughter is becoming my son.'

During an interview on a Chicago radio station the R&B singer seemed to imply that Jay’s
 coming out had been a falsely reported rumour – despite the fact he announced the news in a blog post via his Ask.FM account.

During an interview on a Chicago radio station the R&B singer seemed to imply that Jay's coming out had been a falsely reported rumour - despite the fact he'd come out personally in a blog post via his Ask.FM account

When questioned about the news the 47-year-old singer told Chicago's WCGI interviewer: 'You don't really wanna open it up by saying my daughter is becoming my son,'

'Because if that were true..'

The interviewer interrupted and explained that she is quoting blogs to which R. Kelly replied: 'Don't even give the blogs that kind of credit. You know what I'm saying? Real talk.'

'But as far as that is concerned,' he continued. 'Always believe what you see with your own eyes that is. Always believe what you see. That is the best way to go about this business.

Proud: Jay Kelly, whose father is singer R. Kelly, has revealed that he is female-to-male transgender and living as a boy. He said that he is not close to his father and they have not spoken about his announcement

'And I've heard a lot of things about a lot of people and it was never true.'

'You gotta know there's a back story. There's a background. That's why you can't judge nobody.'

Kelly
 then diverted the subject to talking about his divorce and selling his home saying: 'You save money so your kids can go to college - no matter what 
they are or who they are. They're your kids, you gotta support them.'

'I have three lovely, lovely kids that I am in love with and that's in love with me.'

Earlier
 this month Jaya, the youngest of the singer's three children with his 
ex-wife Andrea Kelly revealed that his singer dad has yet to speak to 
him since the 
revelation.

Responding to questions on his Ask.fm profile,
 Jay explained that although he was born biologically female, he has 
identified as a male since he was '6 or 7' and that his mother has known
 for a year.

His mom who is 
the star of reality series 'Hollywood Exes', has been supportive of his 
transition and has proudly shared pictures of them together online.

'My mom was like, "Baby, you know I love you if you were bi, gay, lesbian, you name it and I would still love you so much",' he wrote.

'She was very proud of me, I was like, "Thank you mom for accepting the fact that I'm a transgender".'

'And same with my sister, she told me that she was proud of me, and respects me by calling me handsome and calling me her little brother now, and I love her for that, so you know it was great for me.'

He added that he is eager to undergo the gender realignment operations but that he knows he'll have to wait for several years.

Support: His mom, Andrea Kelly, who stars on 'Hollywood Exes', has been supportive of his announcement

Loved: Jay, right, said that his older sister Joann, left, has also told him that she is proud of him

'I believe I am a boy and want surgery, and the medication to help me (be) who I was supposed to be,' he wrote.

From a very young age he knew he did not want to be a girl, wear dresses, grow his hair long or have breasts or female sexual organs, he explained on Ask.fm.

Aged 11, 'I would look up like boy 
changes to girl, and girl changes to boy, and im like wow, theres people
 who feel EXACTLY the way i feel and then i knew like thats what transgender is,' he wrote.

He added that he was about six when he knew he was attracted to girls - but he has no plans to date any just yet, adding: 'I've got a lot on my plate right now.'

Silence: R. Kelly, who divorced Jay's mother in 2009, has not spoken to him about his announcement

Jay revealed on Ask.fm that he and his sister are not close to the singer, even though their older brother is.

He added: 'I absolutely love my mother... and yea my dad has not reached out.'

R. Kelly divorced Jay's mother, who had been his former backup dancer, in 2009 after almost 13 years of marriage.

One of the best-selling and highest-earning recording artists of all time with hits like 'I Believe I Can Fly' and the ongoing operatic saga of 'Trapped in the Closet,' Kelly has exhibited signs of financial woes in recent years.

In February it was reported he had allegedly fallen behind on child support payments.

The
 Ignition hitmaker was accused in court papers filed by his-wife Andrea Kelly of failing to pay $20,833 a month in child support 
he owes.

Last year he fell more than $100,000 behind in payments but managed to pay the debt off.

Kelly previously has owed millions in unpaid taxes and even had to auction off one of his homes.

Kelly — whose latest album, Black Panties, debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 in December, is his biggest success since 2009.
