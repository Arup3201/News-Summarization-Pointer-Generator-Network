'Psychology in the Bathroom' lifts the lid on loo behaviour

A new psychology book lifts the lid on the most natural of human behaviours, yet one of the the least explored – excretion. Yes, you read that right.

The act of going to the loo may well often be the butt of a joke (sorry!) but there's a much more serious side, linked to our psychology, don't you know?

Citing studies, facts, figures and theories, 'Psychology in the Bathroom' enlightens readers on all areas of toilet-related behavior, including flatulence, incontinence and constipation.

Despite its humorous tone, the book tackles this most taboo of topics from a serious scientific standpoint.

Is constipation associated with particular kinds of personality? Why do we feel shame and disgust about our toilet habits? These are just a few of life’s dirtiest questions the book attempts to answer.

Written by Professor Nick Haslam, the head of the school of psychology at the University of Melbourne, 'Psychology in the Bathroom (£19.99 Palgrave Macmillan) also investigates cubicle graffiti, toilet-related swearing and erotic urination. 

In the chapter dedicated to breaking wind, the author writes, 'Psychologists have paid little attention to the ludic aspects of flatulence.'

 

The study into the breaking of wind presented college students with a description of hypothetical wind situations and asked the students to judge them on how polite, malicious and humorous they were.

The study found that wind was deemed most polite when accidental, silent, odourless and among acquaintances, and most malicious and obnoxious when deliberate, loud rank and in the presence of strangers. No surprises there then.

The book tackles a taboo in today's society: flatulence

'Interestingly, the farts are most humorous when they are halfway between politeness and obnoxiousness - odourless and in the presence of acquaintance but also loud and deliberate. They are potentially embarrassing but not outright shameful,' Haslam writes.

Did the college students really need a team of psychologists to come to that conclusion? Possibly not.

In another chapter called 'The Anal Character' the author investigates the famous Freudian theory that typical 'anal' characteristics (orderliness, obstinacy and prudence) really are linked to 'concern with defecation'. In other words, do people with uptight personalities also have an aversion to poo?

The book describes several studies that have explored whether this link really exists. In one such experiment by Roswenwald in 1966, participants had to try to identify metal objects at the bottom of a tank using just their sense of touch.

In order to feel the objects, the participants had to plunge their arms elbow-deep into the tank, which was filled either with water or a 'faecal-like stimulus'. (The scientists created a thick smelly mixture using crankcase oil and flour.)

Psychology in the Bathroom: It's a smelly topic but someone has to deal with it

Sure enough, on the task that involved the poo-like mixture, people who had anal characteristics performed worse than other participants. On the task that only involved water there was no difference in performance.

This led the study's authors to conclude that Freud was right - people with an 'anally retentive' personality really do have an aversion to poo. Another poo conundrum solved. Hmm, we're not so sure.

Haslam also explores the human swearing habit. Did you know that has links to toilet habits too?

According to one study of swearing in 25 languages, faeces is by far the most common theme, with 'arseh*#e', 'fa*t', 'pr*t', 'sh*t' and 'turd' the most commonly used expletives. Sodomy-themed words came a close second, with 'bugg*r' and 's*d' at the top of the list.

The study also found that excrement and flatulence related swear words were used more frequently than urinary ones and that urinary words were also deemed less offensive.

Who knew scientists had dedicated so many grey cells to exploring such enlightening matters?
