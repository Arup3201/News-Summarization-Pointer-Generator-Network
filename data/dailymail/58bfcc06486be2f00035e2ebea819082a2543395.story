A 'hungry and unfriendly' Boa constrictor is on the loose, prompting a warning to parents today to keep children and pets indoors.

The 7.5ft snake, called Diva, which squeezes its prey to death, has not eaten for three weeks and was due for a feed when it escaped in Ipswich, Suffolk.

Police admitted they 'cannot rule out a danger to the public' as they launch an urgent search for it after it escaped yesterday.

The nocturnal female snake eats small mammals and when hungry will climb trees and pounce on its prey.

It disappeared from a home just 50m from a primary school, which was running four classes for 70 children despite the teaching strike today.

A spokesman for Suffolk Police said that although Diva is not venomous she may bite if approached and warned anyone who spots her to dial 999.

She said: 'The owner describes the snake as unfriendly, and it might bite if approached. However, it is not venomous.

'The snake is nocturnal and is likely to hunt at night and will bask in the warm grass or on rocks in the sun during the day.

'It will hide for example under sheds when not hunting or warming. She was last fed about three weeks ago and is due a feed.

'Suffolk Police cannot rule out a risk to the public and residents are advised to keep children and pets indoors.

'However, our understanding is that this snake will only feed on small animals such as mice and rats.

'It is possible the breeding season could have encouraged the Boa constrictor to go out hunting.

'The owner has searched her house and when she realised it had got out did the right thing and contacted police.

Boa constrictors are powerful snakes and stealthy hunters. They travel at only 1mph.

They live in tropical climates throughout most of Central and South America, where they hunt at night.

The Boa's hunting technique is generally to ambush prey.

The bigger it gets, the bigger its preferred prey becomes. It may start out eating mice and other small rodents. As it grows, it can handle big iguanas and wild pigs.

They snakes are not venomous. Instead, boas grab and hold onto their prey with small, hooked teeth, wrap around the victim and squeeze them to death.

It swallows its prey whole and food is digested by strong stomach acids.

Boas will generally weigh more than 45kg and grow to about 13ft. The longest boa constrictor ever found was 18ft.

In the wild, a Boa constrictor generally lives for 20 to 30 years.There are sometimes hunted them for their skins.

'She is quite knowledgeable about snakes and felt she had a duty of care to let police know.'

The warning to more than 127,000 people living in Ipswich comes as thousands of children are at home because of teacher strikes.

Diva was last seen at 6am on Wednesday and reported missing at 7pm. It escaped from a house in a cul-de-sac of 28 houses near playing fields.

Neighbour Alexander Drummond, 59, said: 'We're right next to a school and I reckon if I were a Boa constrictor I'd be looking to hide out in the playing fields.

'There's plenty of grass and concrete it can hide under. I'm not too afraid of a Boa.

'If I see it I'll smack it over the head with something. If that doesn't work then I'm a fast runner.'

Diva is described as 7.5ft long, dark and light brown patterned, with creamy white spots on her back, and a reddish brown mark at the end of her tail.

South American Boa constrictors can grow up to 16ft in length and can live for up to 30 years.

Anyone who spots the snake should not approach it, interfere with it or harm it but ring 999 immediately.

If possible, they should keep the snake in sight, but from a safe distance until the police arrive.
