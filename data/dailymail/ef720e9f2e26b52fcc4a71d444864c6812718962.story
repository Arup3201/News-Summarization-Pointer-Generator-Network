These breathtaking images capture the spectacular display by thousands of starlings swamping over the seaside.

At least 50,000 of the birds are thought to make up the ever moving dark cloud performing an aerial dance across the evening sky.

The stunning photographs of the murmurations were taken at sunset by photographer Keith Morris over the past two months.

The huge gatherings are largest in the winter, when their numbers are boosted by birds from Europe migrating for the milder climate.

Mr Morris used a Nikon D4 camera to photograph the flocks above Aberystwyth Royal Pier in Wales.

He said: 'It's very unusual and unique to see starlings in a city as they're normally found in more rural areas.

'It's such a treat to be able to go to the peer every day and see them roost there. I get drawn to them. I think it would be impolite to not go and photograph them.

'There must be at least 50,000. It's certainly a sight to see. I'm entranced by them and evening they perform a different display.

'I could never get tired of them, they really help to unwind after a stressful day too.

'The only issue is that they relieve themselves everywhere, it's very often that you're at the other end unfortunately.'

Mr Morris has been a photographer for 32 years and specialises in theatre and film, but said that he cannot resist the spectacle of the the birds.

The 55-year-old He added: 'You can stand within feet of them, they fly past your face.

'It's a tourist attraction and sometimes there are more people than birds. It really is one of life's little experiences.'

Decline: The spectacle is becoming less common, with the population of starlings dropping 70 per cent

The RSPB said starlings join forces in such a fashion for safety in numbers from predators such as peregrine falcons that find it hard to target one bird amidst a hypnotising flock of thousands.

The birds, which have very precise timing, also gather to keep warm and exchange information on feeding areas.

RSPB'S Johann Holt said: 'In many cases they are like clockwork â€“ you know that at a certain time in the evening the sky will start to turn black, and it's mesmerising watching the flock grow and grow.'

But the charity also said that such spectacles are becoming less and less common, with the starling population dropping more than 70 per cent, leaving them on the critical list of UK birds most at risk.

The decline is thought to be caused by a loss of permanent pasture, increased use of farming chemicals and shortage of food and nesting sites.
