A couple have tied the knot at 30,000ft – after the groom popped the question as a surprise on board a flight to Rhodes.

Alexander Serruys and Marieke van De Wal had their ceremony in the aisle of a plane after he got down on one knee while she was travelling to what she thought was a holiday with her sister.

Alexander, 24, had kept the proposal a secret from his Marieke, 20, after winning the wedding by entering a competition with Thomas Cook.

Popping the question: Alexander surprises Marieke on board the Thomas Cook flight to Rhodes

The bus driver from Bruges sent in a video in response to the travel company’s Facebook post on Valentine’s Day asking: ‘If you could marry your girlfriend in the air, would you do it?’

Alexander was picked from about 25 entries.

The video shows how he planned the big day with the help of his bride-to-be’s sister, who even picked out the wedding dress, trying it on to make sure it fitted.

He invited 40 close members of family and friends, who all hid at the back of the plane, which was flying from Brussels, as Marieke and her sister embarked via a different entrance.

In the footage, Alexander can be seen pushing the food trolley along the aisle to the front of the plane, before dropping to one knee and asking Marieke to marry him.

Luckily, after a pausing for a few seconds, during which she wondered ‘Why aren’t you at work?’ Marieke said yes.

The ceremony was carried out by Thomas Cook Airlines captain, Koen Huizenga.

Alexander said: ‘I had planned to propose to Marieke this summer, but this was a chance of a lifetime. I always had told Marieke that my proposal would be spectacular, well I think I succeeded.

‘It was the biggest moment of my life so it wasn't the right time to be nervous. It just had to be perfect.’

Marieke, who was told she had won a trip to Rhodes, which was being filmed by Thomas Cook, with her sister, said: ‘I honestly thought he would pop the question in a soccer stadium. So I am very happy it happened on a plane.

‘He always said that it would be something spectacular.

'The moment he sat down in front of me I didn't really feel anything.

'My first thought was: "Why isn't he at work?" And then I went into a state of shock. 

‘It was a complete surprise. I was incredibly happy to see everyone there. All the people we can count on were on the plane.’

A Thomas Cook spokesman said: ‘We’re thrilled that we were able to contribute to one of the most beautiful days in Marieke and Alexander’s life. 

‘Since the launch of the video people have contacted us from many places in the world to tell us that we’ve created a smile – or small tear – on their face, and that’s all we aimed. 

‘It’s all about inspiring, personal journeys.’
