Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie made an impromptu visit to greet some of the 12,000 lucky guests who secured free tickets to the Diamond Jubilee picnic held within the Buckingham Palace grounds today.

But instead of taking to the damp lawns to join the 12,000 other partygoers the royal duo joked that they would be dining inside the Queen's official London residence.

Sally Bratt,52, from Hendon, north London claimed that Beatrice told her: 'I think we're going to have a carpet picnic upstairs.'

The 23-year-old royal, who opted for a bold Erdem peacock blue 
print dress and Ferragamo blue wedge shoes, joked that she had yet to 
receive a food-filled hamper and that she would be setting out a picnic inside the
Palace.

Ms Bratt, who works as a teaching assistant, also had time to speak to both sisters about their experience of the Jubilee Pageant during which they sailed down the river Thames aboard the Havengore with their 52-year-old father Prince Andrew.

She added: 'They really enjoyed it yesterday. They said they had a great time.

'I had a chat with Prince Andrew too. He was talking about how the 
guards came on the boat with their coats all soaked and smelling of wet 
dogs.'

The Queen's granddaughters met 
surprised concert-goers near the Garden Entrance of the monarch's home, 
weaving their way through the crowds to welcome bystanders.

Eugenie, dressed in a bright red vintage dress from London boutique D & Me, declared: 'Hello everyone. Who are you all excited to see - apart from Granny?'

As the sunshine came out from behind the crowds, Beatrice declared: 'It's a nice sunny day for it. It's perfect.'

Tim Douglas, from Ivy Bridge in Devon, said after meeting Beatrice: 'She liked the design of our picnic mat - Union flags. She said the weather yesterday at the pageant was typically British.'

Of the guests invited to the Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace., 10,000 were ballot winners and a further 2,000 were from charities

Beatrice described the flotilla on the River Thames as 'great fun' while Eugenie, who took a peek into one of the picnic hampers, declared: 'They've got champagne and everything.'

Brian Greenwood, from York, said after meeting both Princesses: 'We were saying we were a bit disappointed by the weather yesterday. But they said it didn't really spoil things. It's a fantastic occasion.'

Almost every part of the lawn was covered with people. As the sun began to shine, some relaxed to the full, stretching and lying out on their picnic blankets.

Lucky Jubilee picnickers sat down to feast on a
five-course menu created by Heston Blumenthal ahead of a star-studded 
concert to mark the Queen’s 60-year reign.at Buckingham Palace. 

Those fortunate to bag a ticket to the much-anticipated event were treated to tea-smoked Scottish salmon - a modern take on coronation 
Chicken - and Sandringham strawberry crumble crunch after spending several hours queuing down the Mall.

In the spirit of things: Partygoers opted for flamboyant attire as they geared up for celebrations at Buckingham Palace

Individual wicker hampers, jam-packed with culinary goods including a plastic poncho to stave off the 
inevitable downpour, were handed
to the 12,000 partygoers as they entered the Queen's sizable garden.

Of the guests 10,000 were ballot 
winners and a further 2,000 people were invited from charities 
associated with the Royal Family.
Each picnicker was entitled to one alcoholic beverage and most wasted 
no time in taking their vouchers to the drinks tent to collect their 
flute of champagne or pint of Cobra beer.

The
sounds of classical music drifted across the gardens as the Royal 
Academy of Music's Australian String Quartet began to play near the 
Palace lake..

Debby Smith, 43, from Manchester, gave a mixed reaction to Blumenthal's Diamond Jubilee chicken, an update of Coronation chicken which was created to mark the Queen's coronation in 1953.

'I tried the little chicken dish and made it into a sandwich. I'm not a lover of Coronation chicken but it's certainly edible.'

Kavita
Ladva, 42, a solicitor from
Sheffield, said: 'I feel so privileged to be here. It brings tears to 
my eyes. The food is delicious. We had the lovely soup starter and the 
coronation chicken is really creamy with sultanas.'

Jennifer
Beattie, 17, from Newcastle upon Tyne, was there with her 18-year-old 
brother Steven. 'It feels surreal,' she said of being in the Palace. 
'We're speechless.'

Coronation Chicken, created to celebrate the 
Queen’s coronation in 1953, was revamped and renamed by the experimental chef.

Diamond Jubilee Chicken features a 
special blend of spices originally created for a previous television 
programme he hosted about curry.

And as a 
vegetarian option there was a mushroom parfait - a roasted mushroom puree blended 
with a port, brandy and Madeira - and a chilled soup made with plum tomatoes, cucumber and garden mint oil

Seasonal crudites of celery, carrots and red peppers were included as side dishes.

Fiona
Cairns, who baked Prince William and Kate’s wedding cake, created the two 
cupcakes, lemon and caraway Madeira cake and a chocolate indulgence cake, aptly
decorated with a chocolate crown.

She chose to sprinkle one with Blumenthal’s
favourite finishing touch: popping candy.

The potted salmon recipe
included Lapsang Souchong tea-smoked salmon with creme fraiche, lemon 
and fresh chives, while the Sandringham strawberry crumble crunch was crafted from a strawberry compote, meringue, whipping cream, natural 
yoghurt, elderflower cordial and rosewater.

The organic Florence 
strawberries were grown on the Queen’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk and
harvested and frozen last year in preparation for the picnic.

Debby Smith, 43, from Manchester, said: 'It's lovely, its beautiful. You can't believe you're here.'

'I
tried the little chicken dish and made it into a sandwich. I'm not a 
lover of Coronation chicken but it's certainly edible, it's very nice.'

A
cheeseboard featuring West Country farmhouse cheddar and Red Leicester 
crunch was served with Duchy Originals and Waitrose chutney.

Duchy Originals was founded by the Prince of Wales in 1990.

All dishes were selected to be served cold because of the practicalities of catering to such a large number of picnickers.

Waitrose chefs worked with Blumenthal and the Queen’s royal chef Mark Flanagan in developing the selection.

While Blumenthal is famous for his scientific culinary tastes Mr Flanagan and his kitchen - who also catered for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding - maintain a more traditional approach.

Guests, selected via public ballot, could choose to drink Moet & Chandon Champagne, Cobra beer or Hildon water.

Backroom staff and organisers also get a hamper to eat during their lunch break.

In the hamper was a drinks token allowing guests to have either a glass of beer or bubbly.

But for one couple from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, champagne was the order of the day.

Irene and Shaun Doyle, both 67, were lucky ballot winners and travelled from their home for the big day.

Mr Doyle wasted no time in securing himself a glass of champagne then settled down with his wife on the lawn in the middle of thousands of other picnickers.

'Champagne reaches the parts that beer doesn't,' he joked.

'The walk through that palace is unbelievable, it's a dream. When the guy rang us I said "What are you on?". We were just in the middle of our tea.'

Mrs Doyle said: 'We said "Do you think it's someone kidding us?" but now I'm drinking champagne in the Queen's garden.'
