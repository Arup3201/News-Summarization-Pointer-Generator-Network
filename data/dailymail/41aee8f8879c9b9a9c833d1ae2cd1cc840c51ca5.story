Celtic are likely to have to pay £250,000 if they want to land Gary Mackay-Steven this month.

Parkhead boss Ronny Deila confirmed the champions’ interest in the winger this week, with contact already thought to have been made over a pre-contract offer that could see him switch to Glasgow in the summer.

A quicker move to have Mackay-Steven on board for the title run-in would require an outlay, but could also cut off English competition at the pass.

Sheffield United want to sign the 24-year-old immediately and have seen an offer in the region of £100,000 rejected by the Tannadice club.

It’s thought United would want more than double that amount before being persuaded to part with him during the current transfer window.

Returning from the club’s training camp in Gran Canaria yesterday, Celtic No2 John Collins was reluctant to be drawn too much on the situation but admitted Mackay-Steven has attributes that appeal.

‘He’s a good football player. He’s got pace, he’s skilful, but he’s a Dundee United player. We’re looking for speed in the wider areas and at the top of the pitch. It’s very important and if we can find that it would obviously be very good for us.’

Reports in Holland have also linked the club with a move for highly-rated AZ defender Wesley Hoedt. Lazio have bid £1million bid for the 20-year-old Dutch under-21 international, but Celtic, Ajax and Twente are also said to be interested.

Any move would inevitably heighten speculation over the future of Virgil van Dijk but Deila reiterated his stance on the Southampton and Sunderland target when he said: ‘The most important thing is to keep our players. 

'We start with that and then if we get some players who can make us better we will do it. When we come back now that’s the window starting – and then there will be something behind the rumours maybe.’

Meanwhile, Deila has revealed he is happier now to let his players blow off some steam and relax.

He earned a hardline reputation for banning junk food and fizzy drinks from the players’ lunch menu. However, after allowing his squad to socialise and invite their families on the week-long sunshine break in Spain, he says his senior players have earned the right to some rest and recreation.

‘I’m not hard,’ claimed Deila. ‘If you are not fit then you have a problem. But these players in this squad now are fit. The things we were talking about six months ago are not there anymore. They look much sharper.

‘It’s not just about doing all the wrong things. It’s okay to relax. They eat very well, there is no problem with that. What this trip is all about is relaxing their head.

‘But they also have to be in shape and train and be prepared. We had some good training and played the games. We asked them questions in the summer – and they gave us good answers.’

Returning to Scotland ahead of Saturday’s clash with Hamilton - and trailing Aberdeen by four points - Deila still has niggles affecting Charlie Mulgrew, Stefan Johansen and Anthony Stokes. Jason Denayer made his return from injury in a 3-2 defeat to Sparta Prague – but could be granted compassionate leave following the death of friend Junior Malanda.

‘Stefan Johansen has an issue with his ankle so we have rested him,’ added Deila. ‘He is training but we need everybody now to be 100 per cent going into this period. The injured players like Forrest, Charlie and Mikael Lustig are close now. It looks very positive so we are looking forward to the game on Saturday.’
