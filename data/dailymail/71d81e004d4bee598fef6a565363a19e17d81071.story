Hostile: Bar owner Gareth Sale arrives at court accused of turning an air rifle on his customers

An English pub landlord pulled a gun on customers after they tried to order drinks in Welsh, a court heard.

Gareth Sale became involved in a heated row with drinkers days after taking over the Royal Oak pub in Penrhyndeudraeth, Gwynedd.

The 26-year-old landlord allegedly 
produced an air rifle after taking exception at locals trying to order 
drinks in their native language.

Mr
 Sale, along with his partner who were new to the area and didn't speak 
Welsh, asked their customers to order drinks in English.

But
 when customers ordered in Welsh, Mr Sale ejected a group from the pub while brandishing an air rifle loaded with a gas canister, a jury were 
told.

The young landlord is said to have remarked after producing the gun: 'I just want to f****** scare them.'

Sion ap Mihangel, prosecuting, told 
the court: 'The defendant denies the charge. His case is as they were 
new to the area and didn't speak Welsh they asked their customers to 
order their drinks in English.Â 

'Some of their drinkers had taken offence and became aggressive. A crowd had gathered outside and he feared for his safety.'

Caernarfon
 Crown Court heard that the landlady had become involved in a heated 
discussion with locals about ordering in Welsh as she 'could not 
understand it'.

She is said to have remarked: 'Welcome to f****** Wales. What a lovely reception you are giving us.'

Sale disputed that the weapon came out
 of its case and would have been seen out of it or that he said he 
intended to frighten anyone.

Customers
 were told to leave and the doors were locked. But there was banging on 
doors and windows. Sale was told by a man that he couldn't throw people 
out for ordering in Welsh.

Row: Gareth Sale became involved in a heated argument with customers at the Royal Oak after they ordered drinks in Welsh

But he allegedly replied that he had a Japanese Akita dog and guns and people should know this.

The prosecution claim he fetched the rifle.

Mr
 ap Mihangel said police went to the public house that night and spoke 
to the defendant and his partner, who had been drinking.

A jury at Caerarfon Crown Court heard the pair had taken over the Royal Oak pub, but objected to customers ordering drinks in their native language

The prosecutor added : 'There is no issue that night there had been a disagreement at the bar regarding the use of the Welsh language. That is what triggered this incident.'

Sale told police he had been drinking vodka and Coke, and his partner had significantly more alcohol and was argumentative with locals.

Sale, of Dunston, Gateshead, denies possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence on June 18 last year.

He said he feared for his safety and accepted his actions were 'foolish.'

The trial continues.
