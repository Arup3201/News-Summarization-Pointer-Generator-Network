Bruce Wilson, ex-boyfriend of former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, should face corruption charges, according to the Royal Commission into Trade Union corruption.

The first report into the year-long inquiry report was released on Friday, recommending prosecutors charge former union official Bruce Wilson and also Ralph Blewitt but also suggests some information can never be made public because it would place people in danger.

During the hearings, Mr Wilson, a former union official had denied ever giving Ms Gillard 'wads' of cash and accused fellow witnesses of lying.

Former Australian Workers Union official Ralph Blewitt leaves during a break in his testimony at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, back in May. The Royal Commission investigated union slush fund activity, in particular one set up by Australian Workers Union officials 20 years ago, and has recommended charges be laid against Mr Blewitt

Employment Minister Eric Abetz, on Friday, released the interim report of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption which recommends charges against several people including former union officials Bruce Wilson and Ralph Blewitt

Mr Blewitt and Mr Wilson have been referred to Victorian and West Australian prosecutors by the royal commission.

It says that prosecutors should consider charging both for obtaining financial advantage by deception and conspiracy over an infamous Australian Workers Union slush fund.

They are among a range of union officials the royal commission has concluded could be charged. 

239 witnesses gave evidence across eight months.

At the centre of the controversy were claims that Mr Wilson paid for renovations to Ms Gillard's house, when the two were in a romantic relationship in the early 1990s.

It also recommends the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions consider criminal charges against a range of CFMEU officials, in relation to various acts of intimidation and coercion.

Also listed are recommendations that ASIC consider charges against the Queensland state secretary of the CFMEU for breaches of the Corporations Act.

It says the Commonwealth DPP should also consider criminal charges against a range of Health Services Union officials for making false statements contrary to the Commonwealth Criminal Code.

And it further recommends the Victorian secretary and assistant secretary of the CFMEU be considered by the Victorian DPP for prosecution for blackmail.

The Royal Commission report says that prosecutors should consider charging Mr Wilson for obtaining financial advantage by deception and conspiracy over an infamous Australian Workers Union slush fund dating back some 20 years

Former union official Ralph Blewitt could face corruption charges. An interim report into Trade Union Governance and Corruption has identified several areas of concern about union election slush funds - namely their 'secretive' operations, deficient or non-existent record-keeping and that contributions to them may not have been voluntary

Employment Minister Eric Abetz released two volumes of the interim report at Parliament House in Canberra.

A third volume dealing with serious criminal matters is confidential and won't be publicly released because 'disturbingly' it poses risks to the safety of certain individuals.

'The conduct which is part and parcel of the third and confidential report reveals grave threats to the power and authority of the Australian state,' he said.

The report also identifies several areas of concern about union election slush funds - namely their 'secretive' operations, deficient or non-existent record-keeping, and that contributions to them may not be voluntary.

Other concerns were that candidates often pleaded ignorance on funding sources, expenditure and debts incurred and that slush funds disproportionately advantaged incumbents.

'There is a culture of wilful defiance of the law that appears to lie at the core of the CFMEU,' the report found.

Senator Abetz said that proved the powers of the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) must be restored.

No objective reader of the report could doubt the urgent need to strengthen governance through the establishment of a Registered Organisations Commission (ROC), Senator Abetz claimed.

Legislation to set up the ABCC and ROC has been stymied by parliament.

'I would have thought that anybody that is committed to the trade union movement would want to see a clean trade union movement - one where there is not criminality, where there is not thuggery, where there is not funny money dealings going on,' Senator Abetz added.
