Samir Nasri claims Chelsea and Manchester United will provide the greatest threat to Manchester City this season, but has played down Liverpool's chances of mounting another title challenge.

Brendan Rodgers' side came within two points of winning the Premier League title last season, but the French midfielder believes that the Reds return to the Champions League will see them struggle this term.

'Liverpool will find it tougher because they have lost Luis Suarez and they will be playing Champions League football so it will be different for them,' he told the City matchday programme.

Red rage: Samir Nasri does not see Liverpool as a threat to Manchester City's title ambitions this season

Joy of Cesc: The arrival of Nasri's former teammate Cesc Fabregas has strengthened Chelsea

'Last season they only had the Premier League to go for in the final months and it gave them a real advantage because their players were going into games fresher at a vital stage of the campaign.'

Despite finishing 22 points above their neighbours last season, and already being four points ahead of them this campaign, Nasri still rates United as challengers along with Jose Mourinho's new look side.

'I think our two main rivals will be Chelsea and Manchester United.

'Chelsea have made some good signings and Cesc Fabregas will be the guy to replace Frank Lampard. He is a great player, I know that because I was with him at Arsenal.

'Chelsea had a weakness up front last year but have signed Diego Costa. They will be really dangerous.

Afterthought: Alexis Sanchez (L) could bring Arsenal into the mix according to the French midfielder

'United have a new coach, have strengthened as well and don't have any European competition -- so I expect them to come back stronger, too.'

The 27-year-old also commented, almost as an afterthought, on his former club Arsenal's chances.

'But Arsenal could be in there, too, and bringing in players like Alexis Sanchez will make them stronger.'
