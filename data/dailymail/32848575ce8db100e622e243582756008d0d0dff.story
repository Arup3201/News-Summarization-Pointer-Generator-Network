The horse that was set to become the first Triple Crown winner in 34 years has been scratched the day before the Belmont Stakes and retired with a swollen tendon.

I'll Have Another – the winner of both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes – will not race in the 2012 Belmont Stakes, according to his trainer, Doug O'Neill.

'I’ll Have Another is officially out of the Belmont,' O'Neill said on the Dan Patrick Show this morning. 'It’s not tragic, but it’s a huge disappointment.'

The three-year-old colt, who was aiming 
to become the twelfth horse to win the Triple Crown, has got tendonitis in 
his left front leg, according to O'Neill.

'He’s not 100 percent, and I ain’t taking any chances,' he said, according to CBS.

Asked if I'll Have Another has raced his last race, he said: 'If I had to wager . I would say yes.'

During a New York Racing Association press conference at 1:00pm today, O'Neill said: '"It's been an incredible ride, an incredible run,' but 'it was unanimous to retire him'.

Dennis O'Neill, brother of trainer Doug O'Neill, said the heavy 4-5 betting favorite galloped early Friday morning and after a veterinary scan, his tendon seemed 'kind of tender.'

He added to The Associated Press: 'We're very, very bummed out, but we'll be back next year.

Just a bummer, real, real bummer.

'The horse looks fine. Looking at it,
you would never think anything is wrong. He looks great. He's sound. He
went great this morning. He looks super and you just can't take a 
chance. He's too valuable of a horse and we love him to death like all 
of them.

'You wouldn't run a horse if you think something might happen.'

'It's devastating. I 
thought this was going to be one of the greatest races in history, and I
wanted the opportunity to be part of it,' said Dale Romans, trainer of 
second favorite Dullahan. 'But this is bigger than that. This is 
terrible news.'

It was the first time since 1936 that the Derby and Preakness winner didn't run in the Belmont. That year, it was Bold Venture and in 1932, Burgoo King skipped the race.

I'll Have Another came out of a losing effort in the Hopeful Stakes at Saratoga last September with shin problems and took the rest of the year off.

on the Triple Crown trail.

Doug
O'Neill and owner J. Paul Reddam immediately gave I'll Have Another two
months off leading up to the Santa Anita Derby, which he won by a nose 
on April 12.

He followed 
with victories in the Kentucky Derby on May 5 and the Preakness two 
weeks later to set up a highly anticipated bid to become racing's first 
Triple Crown winner in 34 years.

Doug O'Neill said the decision to 
bring I'll Have Another to the track shortly after 5:30 a.m. on Friday 
was to avoid congestion around the detention barn housing the 12 horses 
entered for the Belmont.

The colt jogged and then galloped around the 1½-mile oval accompanied by stable pony Lava Man.

'It's
been very hectic the last few days, so we thought we would take him out
when it's quieter,' O'Neill said in a statement released by the New 
York Racing Association.

'The detention barn setup with all 12 of the horses going out at the same time has been a little bit hectic.'

When horses return from their morning
exercise, they are walked around the barn area to cool down and then 
bathed before being led back to their stalls.

'The simple thing of just trying to find a place to bathe your horse has been kind of congested,' O'Neill had said.

'We thought we would come out early, 
and it would be quieter. Hopefully he will be back resting in his stall 
when 8:30 rolls around and a lot of the hectic activity starts. We want 
to get him in the quietest frame of mind leading up to the biggest race 
of his life.'

O'Neill had declared his colt 'fit and ready to go.'

'We are just trying to let him bring as much energy to the table tomorrow as possible,' he added.

'We
thought giving him an easy day the day before would be a good move. He 
stayed with coach Lava Man just to keep everything off-speed. I was very
pleased with it. Perfect. We are ready to roll.'
