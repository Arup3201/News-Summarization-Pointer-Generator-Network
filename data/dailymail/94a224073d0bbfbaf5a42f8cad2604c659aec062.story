A schoolgirl was in hospital last night after being shot while watching TV on the sofa with her mother.

Davina Adarkwa, 11, was caught in a hail of bullets when gunmen opened fire from as little as three metres away through the window of her home.

The promising student and her mother, Abena Adofo, 48, were both injured as up to 10 rounds were blasted into their living room.

Detectives said it was a miracle no-one 
was killed as the window was obscured with blinds and the hooded gunmen 
could not see who was inside.

They are trying to uncover who was the intended target of the shooting in Cricklewood, North London.

One witness, who helped carry Mrs Adofo to safety, said he thought the 
bangs were fireworks before spotting the gunman aiming a weapon.

He said: ‘I looked out the window and saw the guy pointing into the 
house as he fired the last shots. I think there were about seven shots.

‘Nobody just comes and starts shooting through a window. I was searching
 through my cupboard for something and heard a pop, pop, pop.

‘I looked out of my front window and saw the guy just aim into the window and shoot. It didn't register at the time.

‘When I came out it smelt like there was gunpowder in the air. I helped 
carry the mum out and laid her on the snow. She was lying on the snow 
injured in front of her son.’

The shocking attack took place in a tightly-packed road of 12 houses shortly before 10pm on Sunday evening.

The schoolgirl, who recently appeared on a ‘roll of honour’ at her 
Camden primary school, was hit in the foot. Her mother was hit in the 
chest and leg.

Both were taken to a North London hospital where they underwent surgery 
to remove bullet fragments. Four other adults in the house were 
uninjured.

Three black men were seen running away after the shooting, which police believe may have been a gang-related attack.

Neighbours said the family have lived in the close-knit community for 
more than a decade and Mrs Adofo’s husband died two years ago.

Last night forensics officers were using metal detectors in their search for bullet casings in drifts of snow outside the home.

They erected a powerful floodlight in front of the house as seven 
officers put on kneepads and carried out an inch-by-inch fingertip 
search.

Five bullet holes were visible in the windowpane where the wooden Venetian blinds were still lowered.

Det Insp Glenn Butler, who is leading the inquiry, said it was ‘lucky no-one was killed’ when the men fired up to 10 shots 
blindly through the window.

The officer, of Scotland Yard’s Trident gun 
crime unit, added: ‘It is safe to say that the two people injured are 
innocent people that have been caught up in whatever has happened 
here.‘We still do not know how many shots have been fired. It could be 
as many as 10. I cannot be sure whether there were one or two guns.

‘We have no motive and there does not appear to be any other incidents linked to this at the moment.

‘They have been shot through the window of their living room as they sat
 watching TV. The wooden blinds were closed and the suspects fired 
through the window.

‘They have fired from around three or four metres away. Without being 
too dramatic, it is fair to say it is lucky no-one was killed.’

Police are hunting for three black men wearing dark clothing with their 
hoods pulled up seen walking to a light-coloured getaway car.

Investigation: Police are appealing for witnesses following the shooting in a residential area

One neighbour said the street has been blighted by several gang-related attacks, including a stabbing, over the last year.

He said: ‘I have asked to get moved from here, but the council don't think I am in any immediate danger.

‘I have kids and I am married, supposing the bullets had come through my
 window – my son was playing PlayStation at the time and they could have
 got him.

‘I heard gunshots and asked my son to run away. He didn't understand why
 I was shouting at him. I came outside and didn't see anyone to my 
right.

‘But if I had looked to my left I would have seen someone. When I looked back I saw someone running away.

‘The victims are really nice people and this is a close knit community. I
 can't think of any reason behind this. It's shocked us all.’

Another neighbour said: ‘I think the woman's husband died two years ago and she was raising the children on her own.

The attack is being investigated by 
the Metropolitan Police's Trident Gang Crime Command which specialises 
in 'black-on-black' gun crime.

Det Insp Butler said: 'We have a limited description of three black males wearing dark clothing and hoods walking through Garlinge Road.

'They turned up in a light coloured 
vehicle. They walked through the estate and witnesses report seeing them
 walk back to the light coloured car.

'We are still appealing for witnesses. We have no idea of a motive yet and do not wish to speculate.'

The area 
has been cordoned off while special police officers use 
metal detectors and to search through bins for clues.
