Lee Westwood has called on the European Tour to resist any temptation to mimic their American counterparts by overhauling the season’s finale.

The Race to Dubai has become all but a procession for Rory McIlroy, whose lead is almost insurmountable heading into the penultimate event of the Tour at the Turkish Airlines Open this week.

McIlroy’s lead of close to three million points is such that he is missing the event in Antalya, which starts on Thursday, and it would require at least wins here and in Dubai next week from any of Jamie Donaldson, Sergio Garcia or Marcel Siem for the Northern Irishman to not emerge with the title.

It is a far cry from the PGA Tour, whose four-tournament FedEx Cup series at the end of the season offers considerably more points than regular events, with the winner of the points-rich final event – the Tour Championship - going on to win the FedEx Cup in each of the past five seasons.

Westwood believes that is a model the European Tour should not replicate too closely, even if it would make for a more exciting conclusion to the season.

He said: ‘There's going to be flaws in it, whichever way you go. I'm a big fan of somebody showing consistency over the whole year and winning it. If you look at Rory's season, he's won two major championships, a World Golf Championships, and our flagship Event, the BMW PGA Championship, which is a phenomenal year.

‘If you put that up in somebody's career, those four tournaments, that would be a good career, and he's done that in six months, basically.

‘Occasionally somebody will do something extraordinary and deserves to win the money list. If you have it where it's all on the last event, we are getting into that area of copying the PGA TOUR and copying the FedEx.

‘People complain that it's a little too volatile at the end. I've looked over the last few years and it just seems that whoever wins THE TOUR Championship wins the FedExCup in the States. You can look at that one of two ways - that's not ideal sometimes.

‘I have no problems with it being over before the final event, especially this year with what Rory has done.’

Westwood, meanwhile, echoed his support for Darren Clarke’s bid to be Europe’s 2016 Ryder Cup captain.

Westwood, who had backed Clarke for the role that ultimately went to Paul McGinley for this year’s event, said: ‘I think The European Tour is very lucky. It's got lots of good candidates, lots of former Ryder Cup players that have got experience of many different captains.

‘It's probably between Darren and Miguel Ángel Jimenez. Darren just edges it for me. There’s his record and also with it being in the States where Darren's got a good reputation. Not that Miguel hasn't, but Darren's won World Golf Championships over there and he's played the PGA Tour quite a bit and been a member of that Tour.

‘I backed Darren last time and Paul got it; and I was wrong - Paul was a great captain. I'd like to see Darren get it next time around and sit down with Paul and let Paul shoot a few ideas at him and feed off that momentum that Paul really built up as far as being the captain.’
