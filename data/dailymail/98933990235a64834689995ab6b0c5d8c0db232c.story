Lovestruck: Peter Backus found his other half just two years after figuring out he only had a one in 285,000 chance of doing so

It is tough out there for anyone looking for love, but now the man who figured out there are only 26 potential partners for him is about to get married.

It has been revealed that researcher Peter Backus, from London, eventually found his other half and will tie the knot this weekend.

In 2010 Backus figured out that there were only 26 women in the United Kingdom that would fit his age, educational and physical preferences.

The then University of Warwick professor had spent three years without a girlfriend, and described the study as just a funny little thing.

But, despite the odds, he found his fiance Rose who ticked all the boxes.

He told TODAY: ‘When you work out the numbers, they're not unreasonable, that's the reality people face. It might feel surprising, but most people work out the equation.

‘I met [Rose] at a dinner with some friends in London. It was just a chance meeting, just a friend of a friend.’

In 2010 Backus hit the headlines when he published a paper titled “Why I don’t have a girlfriend’, which used the Drake equation to calculate how many potential partners there were out there.

The equation was created by astronomer Frank Drake in 1961 to estimate the number of alien civilisations that exist in our galaxy, the Milky Way.

Backus then used the equation to figure out that there are only 26 potential partners for him, which gave him a 0.00034 per cent chance of meeting one of them on a night out in London.

But, Backus found his soulmate, and says that people should remain hopeful, despite the odds.

He said: ‘Keep looking, and spend a lot of time hanging out in places where other people who satisfy your criteria hang out. That's what the equation shows.’

The baffling Drake equation reads: N = R* x Fp x Ne x Fi x Fc x L, and helped pioneering scientist Professor Drake to predict that there could be 10,000 civilisations in our galaxy.

Backus simply replaced the original 
equation with his own criteria for a dream date, which included the 
percentage of women likely to find him attractive.

He said at the time: ‘The research may sound depressing to people looking for love, but the good news for singles is, it's probably not your fault!’

Backus’s paper has become legendary, attracting extensive media attention and even warranting a mention on hit TV show The Big Bang Theory.
