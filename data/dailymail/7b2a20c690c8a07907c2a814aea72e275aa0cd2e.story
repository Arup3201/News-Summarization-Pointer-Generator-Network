Jamie Vardy's team won 5-3 on this day four years ago as well, but the circumstances could hardly be more contrasting.

He was playing for FC Halifax Town at the time in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League, the seventh tier of English football, and that night 658 hardy souls saw the Shaymen beat Vardy's former club, Stocksbridge Park Steels.

Their Bracken Moor ground, with its weather-worn stands and grass bank behind one goal, is a million miles away from where Vardy is now, putting Manchester United to the sword in one of the most remarkable results in the Premier League era.

Forget Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao, this was the Vardy show as he ran United's atrocious defence ragged, exposing the fundamental flaw in Louis Van Gaal's thrill-a-minute football masterplan.

Vardy was irrepressible, playing a role in all five of Leicester's goals. He crossed for Leonardo Ulloa to head home the first and was fouled by Rafael Da Silva to win a penalty for the second.

He inadvertently blocked a shot to tee up Esteban Cambiasso for their third, then broke clear to calmly roll home the fourth.

Finally, all for good measure, he bamboozled Tyler Blackett to win a penalty for the fifth, the foul prompting referee Mark Clattenburg to send off the youngster. It was the final indignity on an afternoon in which United simply imploded.

So it was Vardy, a man who was playing non-league football as recently as May 2012, who ruthlessly exposed United's glaring defensive failings. Proof, as if it were needed, that you should always expect the glorious unexpected in football.

United's attacking football was magnificent - Di Maria was mesmerising, Falcao dangerous, Van Persie clinical - but they spent the second half at sixes and sevens in defence.

In the end, those numbers could well have been Leicester's goal tally, perhaps even more.

United weren't helped by Clattenburg's incorrect decision not to penalise Vardy for barging Rafael over in the lead-up to the first penalty, nor earlier on when Jonny Evans, arguably the one member of the back line who looks competent, succumbed to injury on the half-hour.

He was replaced by Chris Smalling, himself returning from an injury lay-off. But most of Leicester's other profitable moments going forward were the result of a defensive horror show.

Van Gaal spent £16m on Marcos Rojo and will be alarmed at how susceptible he looked. Vardy tied the Argentine in knots, notably when he skinned him to cross for Ulloa to get Leicester back in the game at 1-2.

It also his poor pass in the 79th minute that enabled Ritchie De Laet, a United reject, to mug Juan Mata and play Vardy through for the fourth goal.

Rojo is meant to be more comfortable at left-back than in the middle but that wasn't apparent here. He looked totally stunned by the pace of Premier League football, an accident waiting to happen.

Blackett is just 20 and has much to learn and with United's defensive injury problems continuing, he'll have to educate himself quickly.

First though, he'll have to serve a suspension. He made one excellent last-ditch tackle to thwart Vardy when clean through but was reckless in bringing down the striker to concede a penalty and earn himself a red card.

Blackett is still meek, he hasn't yet developed the command and authority needed to operate at centre-half and would have benefitted greatly from a few games alongside Nemanja Vidic or Rio Ferdinand.

United were hasty in letting them go. The years of experience they could bring to the back line is painfully missing.

Evans, who sat on the bench in a protective leg brace and left the King Power Stadium on crutches, is the closest United now have. It looks like he'll be absent for quite a few weeks.

United could have done with the authority and experience of Rio Ferdinand, who went to QPR over the summer

They play West Ham next weekend but have tougher assignments against Everton, Chelsea and Manchester City on the horizon.

The title contenders would have watched Vardy's performance with glee. If a newly-promoted team can rip United open at will, then they'll have a field day.

Rafael, equally, looks a liability. He was out of position when Ulloa headed in and allowed himself to be pushed over by Vardy when trying to usher the ball out.

His resultant foul on the Leicester man inside the box was beyond stupidity with Blackett covering.

Daley Blind and Ander Herrera were exclusively concerned with pushing forward, they felt it wasn't their business to track back and provide cover.

As a result, the space Leicester were able to exploit on the counter-attack was astonishing. This would never have happened under Sir Alex Ferguson and probably not even under David Moyes. 

This result has ruthlessly highlighted the flaw in Van Gaal's summer transfer policy.

Overloading the team with some of the world's best attacking talent is all well and good but defensively, United are still short of two world class defenders. They are imbalanced and how it showed.

Luke Shaw has yet to figure and Rojo yet to impress. It certainly would have been handy to have a Mats Hummels or Thomas Vermaelen figure ready to step in but United went for style over substance.

Captain Wayne Rooney spent much of the second half screaming at his defence. The fury and frustration in his eyes and voice clear for everyone to see.

It could become a familiar sight this season at this rate.
