With sunlight streaming through the windows, this immaculate bedroom with polished floorboards should be welcoming to flat seekers in Oslo.

But it comes with a dark past.

It was in that very room that Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik plotted the country's worst peacetime massacre after he moved in with his mother, Wenche, in 2006.

Anders Behring Breivik, seen here making a salute at his trial in Oslo, pleaded to be let out of jail to attend his mother's funeral. The 34-year-old right-wing fanatic killed 77 people in twin attacks on July 22, 2011

Now, following the death of 66-year-old Wenche in March, the four-bedroom apartment in the child-friendly district of Skoyen, has gone on sale, according to newspaper Dagbladet.

It is on the market for 3.7million krone (£408,000).

The sale comes as Breivik yesterday renounced an inheritance from Wenche to avoid it going to the state which wants to compensate the families of his victims, according to his lawyer Tod Jordet.

During his trial, it was revealed that Breivik had cheated to avoid paying income tax to a state that he strongly opposed.

The 34-year-old right-wing fanatic killed 77 people in twin attacks on July 22, 2011, in Norway's worst peacetime massacre.

Breivik detonated a car bomb outside government offices in Oslo killing eight people and then drove to the island of Utoya where he massacred 69 in a shooting spree at the summer camp of the governing Labour Party's youth wing

island of Utoya where he massacred 69 in a shooting spree at the summer 
camp of the governing Labour Party's youth wing.

Breivik, who stayed at the flat for five years, would spend a lot of time holed up in his bedroom playing video games, and drawing up his deadly plan, according to prosecutors during his trial.

Last August, a court declared him sane and sentenced him to 21 years in jail, the maximum sentence allowed by Norwegian law.

After the death of his mother in March, the four-bedroom apartment where Breivik lived in the district of Skoyen has gone on sale

The sale of the flat, where Breivik lived for five years, came as he renounced an inheritance from his mother to avoid it going to the state which wants to compensate the families of his victims

Marie Mindresunde Moen, estate agent at Eie which is marketing the property, said in an email to Dagbladet, that she was hopeful of securing the sale.

And marketing and communications manager Maren Synnevag added that she too saw the apartment as an 'ordinary sale'.

'We will conduct this sale in the same way as for other accommodation we provide but we want only serious interested parties,' Ms Synnevag said.

These are the details of the flat, according to Eie.

During the trial, it emerged that Wenche Breivik was already terrified of her son when he was just four years old.

The court heard how the 'hyperactive and aggressive' boy was incapable of feeling joy or pleasure.

It was also revealed that he would laugh in his mother's face when she tried to impose limits.

Wenche called in social workers who wanted to remove the disturbed boy and put him in a foster home to prevent any further psychological disintegration.

She was still terrified 23 years later when, on moving back into her home in 2006, he would 'sit on top of her on the sofa' and attempt to kiss her face.

In a statement to police read out to the court, she said: 'I felt like I was in prison with him. He was uncomfortably intense.

'He started saying I was a Marxist and a feminist. From 2010, he became really strange.'

The killer smirked throughout as the 
Oslo court heard how he began wearing a mask around the house and 
passing plates to his mother from behind doors to avoid being infected 
with germs.

A week before his twin attacks on Oslo and Utoya Island, Breivik told his mother he felt ugly and wanted to have a facelift.

Breivik
and his mother met in early March at Ila 
Prison where Breivik is being held, his lawyer Mr Jordet said at the time.

'He was allowed to say goodbye.
They both knew it would be the final meeting,'

His
mother never attended Breivik's 10-week trial for health reasons, but 
in a statement read in court she said Breivik had fabricated 
information.

Breivik and his mother had telephone 
contacts in recent months because she was not able to visit him in 
prison for health reasons, Mr Jordet said.

'He told me they had completely 
opposite ideological views but they had a good mother and son 
relationship,' the lawyer said. 'He regarded her as a good mother.'

The
self-styled anti-Muslim militant denied criminal guilt, saying he's a 
commander of a resistance movement aiming to overthrow European 
governments and replace them with 'patriotic' regimes that will deport 
Muslim immigrants.

Police said they found no evidence of Breivik belonging to any such group.
