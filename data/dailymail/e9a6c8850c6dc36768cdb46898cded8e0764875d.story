Violent evening storms following a day of triple-digit temperatures wiped out power to as many as 3million people and caused at least fifteen fatalities across the country.

Widespread power outages were reported from Indiana to New Jersey, with the bulk of the service interruptions concentrated on Washington, D.C., and the surrounding areas.

Now, three states - Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia - have declared states of emergency, as temperatures again rise to dangerous levels.

In addition to the heat, officials say cell phone coverage is spotty. Many residents were asked to conserve water because sewage stations had been without power for a time. And authorities cautioned people to drive carefully because tree limbs littered roads and hundreds of traffic signals were out.

No power also meant no way to charge cellphones and laptops, and no Internet access in many areas.

Earlier Friday, the nation's capital 
reached 104 degrees - topping a record of 101 set in 1934. Temperatures 
also soared to 118 degrees in Norton Dam, Kansas, an all-time high.

The storms in D.C. also knocked out Amazonâ€™s Cloud service in Northern Virginia, leaving those in the area without services like Netflix, Instagram, and Pinterest.

More than 20 elderly residents at an apartment home in Indianapolis were displaced when the facility lost power due to a downed tree.

Most were bused to a Red Cross facility to spend the night, and others who depend on oxygen assistance were given other accommodations, the fire department said.

The storms, sometimes packing 70 mph winds, toppled three tractor trailers on Interstate 75 near Findlay, Ohio. Fallen trees were blamed on both deaths in Springfield, Virginia.

Besides the 90-year-old woman, who authorities didn't identify pending notification of kin, a man driving his car was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities identified him as Khiet Nguyen, 27, of Burke, Virginia.

In addition, a park police officer 
was injured by an uprooted tree in the northern Virginia County, and an 
18-year-old man was struck by a power line, Jennings said. He was in 
stable condition after receiving CPR, she said.

West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin 
declared a state of emergency after more than 500,000 customers in 27 
counties were left without electricity.

The National Weather Service warned temperatures could climb near or above 100 degrees on Saturday in many areas that already were without electricity.

Thousands were without electricity in their homes and were seeking refuge in movie theaters, shopping malls, restaurants and official cooling centers.

Forecasters warned that another round of storms was possible in the afternoon, which could complicate cleanup efforts.

At least four utility poles fell on a
road in Columbus, Ohio, making it too dangerous for people in four cars
to get out, police said. One person was taken to a hospital.

As of 1 a.m. Saturday, Pepco was 
reporting 406,000 outages in the District of Columbia and Montgomery and
Prince George's counties, Maryland.

Amtrak suspended its service from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia due to the storms, at least until mid-morning. In the Washington, D.C., area, the Metrorail subway trains were returned to their endpoints due to the storms and related damage, officials said.

'It has had a widespread effect on the region,' Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said early Saturday. He said about 17 train stations were operating on backup power due to local power outages, but that he didn't anticipate service being disrupted on Saturday.

Two young brothers, aged 3 and 5, in eastern Tennessee, had been playing outside on Thursday. The younger boy died later that day and his brother died on Friday afternoon, according to Eric Blach, administrator for the Bradley County Medical Examiner's Office.

In Kansas City, Missouri, city health officials were investigating the deaths of three residents, including a baby boy, to determine if they were heat-related and in Queens, New York, an 81-year-old man died from heat exposure.

The fierce heat had spread east from the central U.S., where temperatures continued to rewrite record books.

Many areas of the country have suffered days of high temperatures and little rain, which have contributed to deadly and destructive fires in Colorado.

The weather is expected to stay hot through the weekend in the same areas of the country, according to Mr Dlugoenski.

'The areas of high pressure are going to break down just a little bit as we head into the first part of next week,' he said. 'It will still be hot, but I think the record warmth will be more erratic.'

The temperature in Nashville on Friday reached 109 degrees, smashing a record high for the city of 107 degrees reached on July 27 and July 28, 1952.

Agriculture experts said cattle, fish and chickens through the state have died as a result of the heat.

In Indiana, where temperatures topped 100 this week, state health officials logged 46 heat-related complaints on Thursday, according to USA Today.

The state averages 62 heat-related hospital visits per week in late June and early July.

'We encourage people who don't have air conditioning to retreat to public areas, libraries, shopping malls, swimming pools or other areas that are cool to allow them to protect themselves,' Indiana State Health Commissioner Gregory Larkin told the newspaper.

Doctors in Jackson, Mississippi, have seen the number of patients presenting with heat-related symptoms double since temperatures soared to 100 degrees on Friday.
