New stress: Middle age used to be a time to enjoy leisurely pursuits, but a study has found that an increase find themselves caring for two generations of family members instead

Middle age used to be a time to throw off the shackles of parenthood and hit the golf course or go on that dream holiday you could never afford because of the commitment of having children.

But that longed-for time to yourself has been replaced by a new set of worries according to a new study.

Gone is the 'empty nest' of past generations, the homes of the middle-aged are still full to the rafters with grown-up children who can't afford to move out and can't get a job.

But it's not just the children of the so-called 'boomerang generation' that are proving a burden to the middle aged.

An increasing number are also taking in their elderly parents to provide care for them.

A study, carried out by researchers at the Oregon State University in the US, blames the recession for making it harder for young people to start their career and family and flee the nest.

And it says that living longer adds unanticipated needs to care for elderly parents.

While putting 'empty nest' plans on hold is not a problem for most when it comes to helping their offspring, it can be a little more frustrating when  according to the study.

Karen Hooker, director of the OSU Center for Healthy Aging Research said: 'We mostly found very positive feelings about adults helping their children in the emerging adulthood stage of life, from around ages 18 to 30.

'Feelings about helping parents weren’t so much negative as just filled with more angst and uncertainty.

'As a society we still don’t socialize people to expect to be taking on a parent-caring role, even though most of us will at some point in our lives.

'The average middle-aged couple has more parents than children.'

The study focused on six sample groups in 2009-10 and the results have recently been published in the Journal of Aging Studies.

Care: The Oregon State University study found that middle-aged people had mixed feelings about having to care for elderly parents

It concluded that most middle-aged parents with young adult children are fairly happy to help them out, and they understand that getting started in life is simply more difficult now.

Some research has suggested that age 25 is the new 22; that substantially more parents now don’t even expect their kids to be financially independent in their early 20s, and don’t mind helping them through some difficult times.

But the response to helping adult parents who, at the same time, need increasing amounts of assistance is not as uniformly positive, the study found – it can be seen as both a joy and a burden, and in any case was not something most middle-aged adults anticipated.

Many middle-aged people said it was difficult to make any plans, due to anxiety and uncertainty about a parent’s health at any point in time.

They are being forced to re-evaluate their own lives say the researchers.

Most said they we’re willing to help their aging parents, but a sense of being time-starved was a frequent theme.

Tough: Many middle-aged people surveyed said that they found it difficult to make plans and were re-evaluating their lives because of caring for elderly parents and supporting grown-up children

One participant in the study said: 'It brings my heart joy to be able to provide for my mom this way.

'There are times when it’s a burden and I feel resentful.'

The university research appears to be backed up by UK statistics.

Office for National Statistics figures released in 2012 said that nearly a quarter of 20 to 34-year-olds were still living with their parents in 2011.

That total had shot up around 20 per cent since 1997.

Nearly two million men and more than a million women were still living at home.

But previous studies have suggested that instead of fearing the 'empty nest' many parents are now dreading having to work until the age of 80 to afford to look after elderly parents as well as children who can't, or won't, leave the family home.

A report from insurance firm LV said that some 900,000 people in the UK expect to work well into the 70s or 80s before they can afford to retire.
