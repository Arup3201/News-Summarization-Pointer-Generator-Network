A man who was part of a mob of masked youths who murdered an innocent painter and decorator has been told he faces a life sentence for the killing.

Allan Kalema, 20, was one of up to 20 'Busy Block' gang members who attacked Andrew Jaipaul, 21, who was described as being 'in the wrong place at the wrong time' when he was killed.

Mr Jaipaul, an aspiring fashion designer, was chased into a children’s play area and knifed 25 times in the head, chest and legs, despite not having any gang connections.

At
the time of the attack, Mr Jaipaul's attackers, from Archway, 
north London, were trying to get revenge on rivals in the ‘Wray Kray’ 
and ‘Crouch Hall’ gangs from neighbouring Holloway.

They
were caught on CCTV heading towards the scene of the killing in Corker
Walk, Holloway, with their faces disguised by masks and scarves.

The
Busy Block had vowed revenge after one of their members, Michael Munza,
was stabbed in the buttocks by members of the rival gangs.

Although there was no forensic evidence 
linking anyone to the fatal attack, detectives identified members of the
gang by scouring hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and matching it with
eyewitness evidence.

On Tuesday Kalema was convicted at the Old Bailey of murdering Mr Jaipaul in the savage attack on June 26, 2011. He is facing a possible life sentence at a court hearing on Friday.

Kalema
was the sixth person to be convicted of the killing, joining Tirrell 
Ball-Thomas, 20, Tommy McInerny, 21, Jojo Mafwa, 20, and two teenagers 
aged 15 and 18, who all are currently serving life sentences.

Convicted: Tony Walker, 20, was cleared of the murder but found guilty of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm while Jamie Farrell, 21, was convicted of violent disorder

Another member of the gang, Tony Walker, 20, was cleared of murder after standing trial alongside Kalema, but found guilty of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.

Three other young men, Jamie Farrell, 21, Elliot Parkinson, 18, and Tylon Mason-Riley, 20, were convicted of violent disorder in connection with the attack.

Two trials heard how residents in Holloway, north London, witnessed a stampede of youths entering the notorious Andover Estate.

They reported that the gang were armed with weapons including pieces of wood, a baseball bat and a metal pole.

Mr Jaipaul was walking through the estate to his home in Birnam Road at around 10pm when he was confronted.

The gang could be heard cheering and chanting Busy Block as they fled after the attack.

A witness from one home in Coker Walk said that after the killing she had heard a noise she described as being like ‘cheers from a stadium.’

Another heard the conversation of one of the gang on his mobile phone, as the youth boasted: ‘He has just been juked up boy. He ain’t going to make it.’

One teenager was heard to ask: ‘Did you see the guy get stabbed? Is he dead?’

Kalema and Walker, both of Upper Holloway, had denied murder and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and violent disorder.

They were due to be sentenced on Friday, along with Farrell, of Islington, Parkinson, of Tottenham and Mason-Riley, from Holloway.

In a victim impact statement, Mr Jaipaul’s mother Joanna described Andrew as ‘a loving and loved son, a brother, a loyal friend to many.'

She added: ‘It is very difficult to put into words the enormous loss and grief that the family feel. That grief is totally overwhelming.

‘As a family we know that we have to move on with our lives and that will always be difficult when such an important part of our lives will be forever missing.’

Tragically his father Godwin died before the case came to court and did not see his son's killers brought to justice.
