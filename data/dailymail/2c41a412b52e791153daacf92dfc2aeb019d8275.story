Louis van Gaal has once again bemoaned the Premier League's Christmas schedule after his Manchester United side failed to score against Tottenham.

Speaking to BT Sport after the game, Van Gaal claimed that 48 hours rest is not enough time for his players to recuperate, explaining that his side began to struggle in the latter stages.

'The second half was a struggle. You can see the players can't recover in two days. It was an ugly match. We played very well in the first half, but [if] you don't score goals, you cannot win.

'I said it already before the matches, but okay. It's a culture of England. I think the human body cannot recover within 48 hours, and you have seen that the second half was a struggle.'

Despite this, the Dutchman waxed lyrical about his side's first-half display, labelling it as the best 45 minutes his United have played all season. 

When asked it a draw was a fair result, Van Gaal said: 'No, we lost two points. It was the best performance of Manchester United this season, in the first half. We could have scored four or five goals, but we didn't reward ourselves.

'Of course [it was a missed opportunity]. You have seen also the match, you can review all the possibilities. Even when we were on the goal line, we couldn't score.'

In an even second half, both sides had golden opportunities to snatch three points.

'We gave three chances away,' Van Gaal continued, 'but we could also have scored three opportunities.

Mata, Van Persie could score, also Falcao. But the first half was a fantastic half of ours. But then you have to finish the attacks, and we were not so effective today.'
