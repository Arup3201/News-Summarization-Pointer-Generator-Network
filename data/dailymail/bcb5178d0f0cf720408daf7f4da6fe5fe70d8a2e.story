Attack: CCTV footage in a Preston  McDonald's showed this woman hitting a man in the ear with her stiletto, and she is being hunted by police

A drunk who attacked a student with her stiletto while waiting in the queue at McDonald's is being hunted by police.

Officers
 said that the attack happened at the restaurant at 5am when the suspect hit the victim in the earhole with one of her high 
heels, before running off.

CCTV captured the woman at the time of the attack at the McDonald's in Friargate, Preston, and also when she fled.

Lancashire Police
 said today that at around 5am on Sunday, October 13, the 24-year-old victim stood waiting to be served a meal with his friend.

The victim's friend then became involved in a drunken argument with the attacker.

It is alleged the woman, who was queuing behind them, shoved him and the victim then intervened.

It was at that point the woman, who was carrying her high heels, hit the victim in his right earhole before walking off.

'This was 
an unprovoked assault which resulted in the victim sustaining a serious 
injury to his ear. I would appeal to anybody that recognises the woman 
pictured in the CCTV image to come forward,' DC Michael Riley said.

The woman is described as having dark brown, wavy hair and was wearing a pink jacket, white top and black leggings.
