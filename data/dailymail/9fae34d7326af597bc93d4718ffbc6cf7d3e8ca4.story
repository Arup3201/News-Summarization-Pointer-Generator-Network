It began when he noticed the view outside his window was used in Ghostbusters and has led to him visiting more than 450 film locations in cities across America and beyond,

Artist and journalist Christopher Moloney, 35, has recreated the most well-known scenes in Hollywood history in locations from New York to Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

From Kill Bill to Men in Black, Avengers and classics such as Rebel Without A Cause, Mr Moloney takes photographs from famous moments and brilliantly lines them up with their real location.

You've Got Mail: Photographer Christoper Moloney visited Cafe Lalo, that was used as the setting of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks' meeting in the 1998 romantic comedy

The Avengers: The photographer expertly lines up the picture of Thor, Captain America and Black Widow with the New York sky scraper behind it

Speed: Keanu Reeves holds his gun aloft as he boards the subway at MTA subway terminal in Union Station, Los Angeles in the classic 1994 movie

Rebel Without A Cause: Mr Moloney visited Griffith Park Observatory in Los Angeles to recreate this classic scene from the 1955 movie starring James Dean

He came up with the idea a year ago after looking out his office window and noticing it was the spot the Marshmallow Man appeared in 80s hit movie Ghostbusters.

He printed out a picture of the scene and lined it up with the view.

When he showed his friends they were so enthusiastic, he was spurred on to create even more.

And the New York based artist saw his collection explode from there - after visiting eight different cities in four different countries to add to the series.

Now his work is currently on display at the Ischia Film Festival in Naples, Italy, after a successful exhibition at the Cannes Film festival earlier this year.

New pictures are also regularly added to his blog.

Mr Moloney, originally from Brampton in Ontario, Canada, said: 'Sometimes I'll be watching a movie and think to myself 'I know where that is.

Travel: The photographer has researched film locations in Los Angeles to Toronto, Chicago, San Antonio, such as these from Kill Bill Vol. 1, left, and Pee Wee's Big Adventure

'Other times I'll be somewhere in the city and recognise the location from a movie.

'I find it fascinating how so many of the locations have barely changed since the 40s and 50s in a city like New York where there is always something being built or rebuilt.

'The most popular one on my site lately is the shot I did of The Avengers at Grand Central Terminal but it is constantly changing as more are added all the time.'
