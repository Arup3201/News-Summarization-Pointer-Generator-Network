An Iraq War veteran started an online fundraiser earlier this month hoping to raise $4,000 for what was described as his final trip home before he succumbs of cancer.

But a California news station has uncovered that Kevin Fish, of Joshua Tree, had used a picture of an X-ray showing a patient suffering from bone cancer taken from a medical journal and presented it as his own on his GoFundMe account.

When confronted by a reporter from KESQ Monday, the retired Army Ranger insisted that the image used on the online fundraiser was taken with his cell phone during a medical examination, and that he was told by his doctor that it was his MRI showing cancer ravaging his body. 

Sad tale: Retired Army Ranger Kevin Fish set up a fundraising page in mid-November asking for $4,000 in donations to be used towards one final trip to visit his family before he dies of cancer 

'Rip-off:' A California news station confronted Fish Monday saying that the 'MRI' image posted on the GoFundMe page allegedly showing his body ravaged by bone cancer was not Fish's 

Looks familiar: The X-ray image used on Fish's donations page was taken from a medical journal published in 2007  

'I'm telling you what happened, as God as my witness,' Fish, a member of a local biker club, told the station.

'I was in the office, he [doctor] put this up on there, after I sat in an MRI box for 30 minutes taking pictures of my body.'

The Joshua Tree resident sought to put the blame on the doctor, claiming that he must have accidentally put up an X-ray image from a 2007 medical journal instead of his actual MRI.

Pointing fingers: Fish insisted that his doctor must have accidentally put up an X-ray from the journal instead of his MRI image 

Lack of evidence: Fish could not produce any documentation showing his two-year battle with cancer 

According to Fish, a native of Houma, Louisiana, he was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer in 2012, but during the Monday interview he was unable to produce any medical files proving that he has been battling the deadly disease for the past two years.

When pressed on that issue, Fish said that he does not keep his medical records at home.

On November 16, the veteran launched a GoFundMe account asking for $4,000 in donations so he could travel to his hometown in Louisiana to visit his family one last time.

By Monday, Fish had raised $1,650. While being interviewed by KESQ, the retired ranger erased his crowdfunding page, but according to GoFundMe.com, even with the account removed he still would be able to access the funds.

Wes Wilson, senior pastor at Sword of the Lord church where Fish is a member, said that he believes some members of the community may have donated money to help the veteran.

Deleted: Fish erased his GoFundMe account Monday, after being confronted about the possible scam, but the website site he could still access the collected funds 

'It's going to sound terrible, but I hope he has cancer,' the clergyman said. ‘ I hope he really is sick. I hope the deception doesn't go so far and it doesn't go so deep that he doesn't have cancer at all.’

Earlier this year, Kevin Fish made headlines in the local media after launching a campaign to raise awareness about the homelessness epidemic among service members in the Hi Desert area.

Speaking to the radio station Z1077 in March, Fish said that he owns a thrift shop called Change for Vets and asked for donations of food, clothing and cash to purchase necessities for veterans in need.
