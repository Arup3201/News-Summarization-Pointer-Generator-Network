Drinkers who get their friends to perform dangerous NekNomination stunts could be charged with manslaughter if they die, lawyers said today.

The warning was issued after Bradley Eames, 20, apparently became the third British victim of the deadly crazy after filming himself downing nearly two pints of gin.

The salesman, from Nottingham, was found dead in his home four days after filming the stunt. Police are understood to have watched the video as they investigate the tragedy.

Latest victim: Bradley Eames, 20, who is thought to have become the third person to die as a result of taking part in a NekNominate challenge

The death is potentially the third in the UK linked to the viral game which involves players filming themselves downing drinks and posting the videos online, daring others to outdo them.

The death of Mr Eames happened after Stephen Brookes, 29, and Isaac Richardson, 20, died after completing similar NekNomination challenges.

Lawyer Julian Young said that anyone who NekNominated in future could could find themselves hauled before a court - even  if the dangerous stunt didn't end in tragedy.

He said that if someone died and the person who urged them to do the dare could face a manslaughter charge.

Mr Young said: 'Any person would have to prove that the person who did the nomination knew with a degree of certainty what was likely to occur.

Determined: He throws back the remaining alcohol to complete his dare

Thumbs up: Bradley attempts to show he is fine after the dare, but just hours later he would complain of feeling unwell

'At the beginning of this no-one knew what was going to happen.'

But he said that there is now a 'good argument' that people would have been able to predict a tragic outcome.

Mr Young said: 'If a person knew, because of all the publicity, and said, "I have been watching it on the news, I nominated my mate and thought he would be all right but knew there was a risk" you could have grounds for a prosecution. It might be manslaughter.

'There is a possibility, if someone knew what the outcome could be, that it could cause death, there could be a prosecution.'

The solicitor, of Julian Young and Co, in London, warned that someone could still face lesser charges of causing actual or grievous bodily harm even if there was no death.

Mr Young added: 'If they harm animals, like swallowing a goldfish, there could be a case for causing unnecessary suffering.'

A former grammar schoolboy was the first British victim of the dangerous NekNominate craze.

Isaac Richardson, 20, was dared to drink something 'messed up' in an effort to outdo other challengers.

He downed a cocktail that consisted of wine, whisky, vodka and lager in Woolwich, south-east London, before collapsing.

Efforts were made to resuscitate the young man who was staying at a hostel above O'Connors pub where he had been drinking. However, he died in the early hours of February 9.

The death is not been treated as suspicious and an inquest has been opened.

A 29-year-old man became the second victim of NekNominations after he downed a pint of vodka.

Stephen Brookes, from Cardiff, was found dead in his bed after having the deadly drink. He was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead in the early hours of February 9.

Friends posted footage of him carrying out his challenge on Saturday but removed it after he became ill and died.

His mother Paula said: 'He went home at about 2am and my daughter-in-law rang me to say he wasn't well and I needed to come over.

'When I got there the paramedics were doing everything they could but he didn't respond. He died in his sleep.'

Dr Phil White, secretary of North Wales Local Medical Committee, said a criminal prosecution would halt the NekNominate craze.

The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global.

The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world.

The concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink Responsible'.

The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet.

One popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain bowl to lap it up.

Another extreme example featured a woman riding a horse into a supermarket and  downing a can of Pepsi.

However, the trend has taken a dark trend in recent weeks as reports have begun to emerge of young men dying after drinking huge amounts of alcohol for a dare.

'If
 there were a prosecution, that would be it,' he said. 'It would stop 
overnight because everything is recorded on the internet. You can tell 
who has challenged someone to do what because it is there in the ether.'

Dr
 White worried it was just a matter of time until a woman died as well -
 even though fewer of them appear to have been involved in Neknominate.

He warned: 'Drinking games are dangerous. People die from them. I see people dropping dead all the time after a binge.

'Neknominating
 just seems to be challenging people to do stupid things. But if you are
 not used to drinking it does not take much to poison you.'

Mr Eames, from Sneinton, Nottingham, filmed himself on February 6, downing two glasses of Gordon’s gin – not quite filled to the top – mixed with teabags.

It is estimated he drank almost 30 shots of the strong alcohol in the two-minute video, before challenging friends to outdo him.

Speaking to the camera, he said: ‘I’ve been watching you guys do the Neknominate but to me I don’t think they’re good so I bought myself some gin and this is how you drink.’

In the video, which is no longer online, he poured himself one pint  and drank it – stopping halfway through to gag.

Mr Eames finished the drink before immediately pouring another while his hands violently shook. He quickly drank that. He then turned to the camera, did a thumbs-up sign and said: ‘Have fun.’
