One of Britain’s most luxurious hotels has reached new heights - by spending £7million building treehouses.

The Chewton Glen in Hampshire’s New Forest is the only place in the country where guests can stay in such arboreal splendour.

The five-star hotel managed to gain permission to branch out and build 12 huge suites upon stilts in a wooded valley - even though it’s next to a National Park.

Scroll down for a mini tour of the treehouses!...

Amongst the trees: A five-star hotel has spent millions building the treehouses next to a National Park

Each suite, built upon stilts and surrounded by oak trees, has it's own spa

The suites are set in six luxury pods that nestle in trees’ canopy surrounded by wildlife.

Breakfast arrives almost magically because staff quietly deliver a hamper each morning through a secret hatchway.

The suites are done out in varying styles and furniture has been especially commissioned to complement the unique setting.

Wooded valley: The cost to stay in the treehouse starts at £600 a night for two people and rises to well over £1,000

Luxury: A bedroom facing the wooded area, with rose petals scattered on the bed

What a view: The bath looks out onto the trees and the nature that surrounds the five-star hotel

Guests can enjoy sitting in a hot tub on the balcony sipping champagne while watching the sunset through the trees.

The 'Grand Designs' project was the dream of designer Martin Hulbert who worked with the space to create the treehouses.

To stay in a treehouse the cost begins at £600 a night for two people and rises to well over 1,000 pounds.

Andrew Stembridge, managing director of Chewton Glen, said their strategy was to work with the local council

Andrew Stembridge, managing director of Chewton Glen, said: 'The inevitable restrictions of building in such a picturesque and secluded valley actually helped shape the design, positioning and vista of each pod and the end result is one that has evolved organically over the course of time.

'Our strategy was to work hand in hand with the local council, the ecologists and arboriculturists and this ensured that everyone and everything was considered from the outset.

'Even the badgers were provided with a brand new five-star home - built out of oak - and other wildlife was politely asked to ‘stand aside’ for a few months whilst we undertook the construction in the most considerate manner.

'Not a tree was felled nor a tree-root disturbed.

'The design and project team also worked
in harmony to create these completely unique buildings which would 
blend into the natural habitat and create the absolute minimum footprint
in every conceivable way.

Masterpiece: 12 pads are built upon stilts to make guests feel like they are sleeping in the trees

Hidden: The entrance to one of the luxury pods

'The valley itself is being allowed to recover naturally and in a very short space of time this haven of wildlife will once again provide the most magical outlook and backdrop for couples and families all looking to escape from the real world and be close to nature in the most luxurious manner.'

The project included general landscaping and the building of a walled garden.
