Tired, with their faces smeared with coal dust, 29 of the 34 Bosnian miners who spent the night trapped deep underground were rescued today - though up to five others are feared dead. 

Rescuers pulled the men out one by one, after they endured a terrifying night trapped 500 metres (1,600 feet) underground when the Raspotocje coal mine collapsed in Zenica, central Bosnia.

Anxious family members cried with happiness as they embraced their loved ones. Ambulances were parked outside the mine entrance to take the miners for a medical check-up.

'He is alive!' Admira Durakovic, whose husband Amir was among the miners, cried before breaking down sobbing and shaking. 

Mine Manager Esad Civic said 29 miners had been rescued, but miners and rescuers at the scene said they feared three of the miners had died, while Sinan Husic, head of the regional miners union, said the death toll could be five.  

Alija Celebic, himself a retired miner, waited for his son Bego, who was rescued safely.

'He was hurt in the mine just two weeks ago, and now this!' Celebic said. 'All is good as long as he is alive!'

The union leader at the Zenica coal mine, Mehmed Oruc, said two tunnels in the mine collapsed yesterday evening following a gas explosion triggered by a minor earthquake that had hit the area near the town.

He said 22 other miners managed to leave the pit after the tunnels collapsed, two of whom were injured.

Those coming out of the pit appeared shaken and tired, some were weak on their feet, but none seemed seriously injured. The men walked slowly as their wives, children and other relatives ran towards them with joy.

The Zenica coal mine was the site of one of the greatest mining tragedies in Bosnia's history, when 39 miners were killed in a gas explosion in 1982.

This is the third incident in the mine this year. A total of 16 miners were hurt in two previous gas explosions, the most recent less than four weeks ago.

Families and the union leaders accused the management of responding poorly to the accident, particularly in initially claiming that only eight people were trapped inside the pit.

Union leaders said authorities only brought in rescue machinery seven hours after the blast.

Mine manager Esad Civcic insisted that 'mine accidents cannot be avoided', although he did concede that the  mine - once among the most modern in Europe - is now far from world standard, following the 1992-95 war that impoverished the country.

Muris Tutnjic, one of the miners who got out yesterday but came to the site today to show support, said the blast 'just blew us away'.

He added: 'I was alone. Thank God I managed to pull myself out. My colleagues - they were some 200, 300 maybe 400 metres away from me, they got covered.'
