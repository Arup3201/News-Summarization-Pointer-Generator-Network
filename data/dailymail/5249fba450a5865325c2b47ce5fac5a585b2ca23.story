The words of Jose Mourinho still echo: 'This is end of career.' I can only hope Martin Atkinson was listening.

The focus is on the referee and rightly so. He’s paid a minimum of £85,000-a-year to watch games and make decisions. Some are difficult, referees will make mistakes, but Atkinson was guilty of not watching the game when Chelsea and Burnley fought out a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge. It’s as simple as that.

Some say it’s more proof that we need technology – indeed that is Mourinho’s view. But why are we paying referees a healthy salary – three times the national average – if they can’t even see what is right in front of them? Jason Shackell’s foul on Diego Costa, the obvious handball in the box from Michael Kightly, Ashley Barnes kicking Branislav Ivanovic, and then Barnes' challenge on Nemanja Matic. If we bring in technology, I’m assuming referees’ pay will be dramatically reduced.

Atkinson will be paid at least £85,000-a-year to referee - why pay it if he cannot see what's in front of him?

Atkinson’s failure could have had horrible consequences. A Burnley player,  Barnes, was allowed to get away with bending and nearly breaking a fellow professional’s leg. I don’t think Barnes is malicious, but I do think he is at best careless, and at worst reckless.

But he is also a player who received a seven-match ban for deliberately tripping up a referee during a game he played for Brighton two years ago. The punishment has seemingly not registered as a deterrent.

Some excessively physical challenges can be excused in the context of any given game, or the competitive spirit of the players. But Barnes on Matic was beyond any mitigation.

The FA have hidden behind their own inadequate rulebook and so there will be no further action taken against Barnes.

He is getting away with it for two reasons: firstly because the ref was so excruciatingly bad everybody is talking about him; secondly, Burnley are everyone’s favourite underdogs, and Sean Dyche is impossible to dislike. Barnes himself has done well as a professional footballer to lift himself up the leagues and make a mark in the Premier League, and I admire him for that. All of these reasons somehow come together to make it hard to criticise Burnley.

Add to that the fact that your average football fan outside of Stamford Bridge dislikes Chelsea, and loves to see Jose Mourinho slip up, and it becomes easy to focus on the bad referee, rather than the naughty footballer.

Sean Dyche is impossible to dislike and that is helping Barnes get away with his horror challenge

The average football fan is desperate for Mourinho to slip up and that also plays in Barnes' favour

If common sense were to be applied instead of the FA’s chopped logic, what would happen here?

With his previous offence in mind, Barnes should be banned for the rest of the season. It would focus his mind in a way the previous ban didn’t. It would also send out a real message to professional footballers that they can’t get away with such challenges. They have a duty of care to fellow professionals.

Atkinson should be put on gardening leave and his position reviewed in the summer.

My instinct tells me Matic was rightly sent off. He was aggressive and then violent with Barnes. But when you look at the circumstances, I think there is definitely a case in this instance for the FA to rescind Matic’s red card but warn him about his future conduct. He is a player with no obvious history of violent conduct on the pitch, but he is a man who objects strongly when someone tries to break his leg. He didn’t swing a punch, he just bundled Barnes over.

After failing to deal with Barnes in an appropriate manner, the Football Association can redeem themselves here. So do the right thing FA, and let Nemanja Matic play at Wembley on Sunday.

Matic may have been violent but the FA should do the right thing at let him play in the Capital One Cup final
