This is the moment when a hot air balloon narrowly missed crashing into a windmill that has stood for 350 years.

The hapless pilot was forced to take evasive action after being suddenly blown off course and sent on a collision path with the historic landmark.

The multi-coloured inflatable aircraft missed the Grade One Listed Chesterton Windmill in Warwickshire by a matter of feet.

After the close call with the monument - which has stood since 1632 - the aviator was heard to have said 'that was a little close.'

Near Miss: A hot air balloon narrowly missed hitting Chesterton Windmill in Warwickshire

The near miss was captured by photographer Chris Day, 48, as he was taking shots of the landmark at sunset on Sunday evening.

'I could see the balloon in the distance and was waiting for it to fly over the windmill when it suddenly lost altitude and plummeted to the ground,' said the photographer from Warwick. 

'It seemed to almost bounce along the ground and came within a few feet of hitting the windmill.

'The speed it was going would have certainly damaged the windmill but the pilot managed to put a burst of flame into the balloon at the last minute and narrowly miss it.

'He didn't seem too bothered as he passed overhead he even doffed his cap and said 'that was a little close, good evening' before disappearing into the distance.'

The 71ft (22m) high windmill was built from limestone and sandstone between 1623 and 1633 by mathematician and astrologer Sir Edward Peyto and is one of the most famous landmarks in Warwickshire.

It is a favourite location for photographers, including EastEnders actor Adam Woodyatt who lives in nearby Southam and takes landscape pictures in his spare time.

In 2006 one of the sails fell off the windmill during an open day, injuring one visitor. Initially, following the incident, the area was roped off to prevent visitors approaching the windmill.

The sails themselves were then removed for strengthening. They were finally replaced in late 2007.
