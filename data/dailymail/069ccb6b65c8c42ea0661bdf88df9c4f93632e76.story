A TV glamour model's 21st birthday meal ended in tears after a waitress shouted at her 'At least I don't get my t**s out on TV'.

Police were called after Rachel Hobbs, who goes under the name Lacey Lorenzo for her adult work, said she received a tirade of abuse when she complained that plates used to serve her birthday cake were dirty.

The 21-year-old, who works for late-night TV channels says that the waitress at The Crown in Bromley, south London, had recognised her from her work.

Miss Hobbs' 76-year-old grandmother, who was at the family celebration, had not known what she did for a living until then.

Bosses at the Toby Carvery restaurant dialled 999 after Miss Hobbs lost her temper in response but police took no action over the December 8 incident. The chain has now apologised for the 'unprofessional comments' of its waitress.

But Miss Hobbs, of Bromley in south London, says that the row has 'ruined' her birthday.

She told how she complained that the paper plates used to hand out her cake were dirty.

She recalled: 'They gave us dirty plates. They had bits of dried food stuck to them.

'When I said 'Excuse me, these plates are dirty', the staff had such bad attitude that they just grabbed them back.

'I said 'That is not very good customer service' and the waitress shouted out in front of everybody 'At least I don't get my t**s out on TV'.

Toby Carvery, in Bromley, south London, has now apologised to Miss Hobbs for the 'unprofessional comments' of its waitress

'The restaurant manager was right there. She shouted it in front of him and he did not know what to say. 

'It's so unprofessional to do that for someone, especially when you can see it is their 21st birthday because there are balloons saying that on the table.

'It's just my job. My nan didn't even know about my job until then but they obviously knew who I was in there. 

'I just wanted to go there because I really enjoy roast dinners. It was so messed up.

'It ruined my birthday. I was crying. I just wanted to have fun on that day.

'For the rest of my life, I am always going to remember being insulted by some stupid little idiot on my 21st birthday.'

Miss Hobbs' mum Maria Draa, 55, said: 'The police were called because my daughter lost her temper. We were just gobsmacked.' 

Miss Hobb's grandmother Joan Skipper, 76, said: 'It was a pretty bad commotion.

'I am not up with what Rachel does. I was not expecting the police to turn up at her birthday.'

A Toby Carvery spokesman said: 'We apologise to Rachel or her family for any upset caused and for the unprofessional comments made by a member of our team.

'We have investigated the complaint fully and are dealing with the employee involved.

'Our manager apologised unreservedly to the family at the time and also waived the meal bill as a gesture of goodwill.'

A Met Police spokesman said: 'Officers attended the scene but were not required as there had only been a verbal altercation between a staff member and a customer.'
