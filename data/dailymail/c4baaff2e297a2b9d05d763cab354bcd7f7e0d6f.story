A plucky pig destined for the butcher's knife made one final bid for freedom - bolting through the door and scrambling on to the slaughterhouse roof.

But the portly porker's adventure was cut short when the roof tiles collapsed under its weight, leaving it wedged in a hole.

Dashed hopes: The pig seems to know that its bid for freedom has failed as it lies down, defeated. It was tied up and taken back to the slaughterhouse in Fengzhou, in China's Fujian province - where later met its fate

The trapped pig was tied up by two men and taken back down to the slaughterhouse in Fengzhou, in China's Fujian province - where it met its fate the following day.

Slaughterhouse owner Zhou Feng, 49, had forgotten to lock the door on the staircase inside, giving the pig its way out.

He said that he thought it was the pig's active life on a free range farm that had given it the strength to make the daring climb.

He said: 'Farmers' pigs are much more wild and always run around and cause trouble, but it is the first time that a pig climbed up on to the roof.

'I will only slaughter factory-farmed pigs in future, they are far more docile.'
