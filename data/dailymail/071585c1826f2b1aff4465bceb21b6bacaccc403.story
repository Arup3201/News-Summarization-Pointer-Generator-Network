Charged: Charles Allen Bickerstaff, 64, of Catbird Retreat on James Island faces nine felony counts of ill treatment of animals

A South Carolina doctor has been arrested Wednesday on charges of animal cruelty after he left nine dogs to die in the back of his car while he went to work.

Charles Allen Bickerstaff, 64, of Catbird Retreat on James Island near Charleston faces nine felony counts of ill treatment of animals.

The animals all died earlier this week in the back of his car which were left in five crates without food and water for three hours.

The temperature in the car reached close to 90 degrees. Cavaliers have long hair and can weigh up to 20 pounds.

His attorney, Bill Thrower, said 
during the bail proceeding that Bickerstaff had an emergency at the 
hospital and had thought that the dogs would be safe in his Ford 
Explorer.

Bickerstaff said he 'feels as bad as anybody' about the death of his dogs, his attorney added.

Staffers
 at Veterinary Specialty Care, an emergency veterinarian's office close 
to the hospital called police on Monday afternoon after a man showed 
them six dead dogs in carriers in the back of his Ford.

The
 man thought the dogs had passed out, he told the employees, according 
to the paperwork, but workers examined the dogs and found that they had 
all died.

The workers examined the dogs and told the man that they were dead.

Police identified the man as Bickerstaff by using information from the vet's office.

He told detectives that he had placed his dog, Butler, and eight others in crates and put them into the back of his SUV.

Police
 Detective Logan Fey said that Bickerstaff had been cooperating with the
 investigation but that the town takes 'all cases of abuse very 
seriously.'

The dogs were found dead in the trunk of Dr Bickerstaff's car that was in the parking lot of East Cooper Hospital, Mount Pleasant, South Carolina

Linda Lombard, a
 magistrate said in setting $10,000 bail on each of the defendant's 
charges, that each of the dogs hadbeen left in the SUV for 'just too 
long.'

According to an 
affidavit, investigators met with him on Monday and he confessed to 
putting his 8 or 9-year-old spaniel, Butler, along with eight other dogs
 into five crates in the back of his SUV.

Bickerstaff
 told police he leftÂ  the dogs in the vehicle while he performed his 
duties at East Cooper Hospital. The affidavit notes that temperatures 
that day ranged from 73.4 degrees to 82.4 degrees with a heat index of 
90.9 degrees.

The affidavit also states the air conditioner was not on and the windows of the Explorer were not open.

Another release from police notes that the dogs did not have food or water and that they were caged for over three hours.
