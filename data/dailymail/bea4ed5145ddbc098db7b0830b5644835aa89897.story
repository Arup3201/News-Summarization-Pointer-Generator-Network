A video posted to the Internet by U.S. weapons giant Raytheon shows the fearsome destructive capabilities of its latest model of artillery shell.

The Excalibur M982E1 155mm GPS-guided shell is claimed to be so accurate that it can be expected to strike within six metres of a target 24 miles away.

That makes it perfect, the company says, for warfare in an 'urban setting'.

The footage shows each blast in Hollywood-style slow motion, to allow the viewer to truly appreciate the destructive potential of the weapons

Three different kinds of shell are shown off, with MACS 3, MACS 4 and MACS 5 charges in the YouTube clip

Raytheon boasts that Excalibur has already been fired more than 600 times in action by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.

The gung-ho YouTube clip, which is set to a progressive rock instrumental, complete with thrashing chords, begins with a logo incorporating an image the sword of Arthurian legend. 

It then shows the shell striking such threatening targets as cars, vans and water towers - as well as more conventional military targets like helicopters and field guns - with explosive results.

Three different kinds of shell are shown off, with MACS 3, MACS 4 and MACS 5 charges, each apparently more explosive than the last.

And each blast is shown in Hollywood-style slow motion, to allow the viewer to truly appreciate the destructive potential of the weapons.

'With more than 600 rounds fired in theatre to date, Excalibur is the revolutionary precision projectile for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps artillery,' says Raytheon.

'Using GPS precision guidance technology, Excalibur provides accurate, first round, fire-for-effect capability in an urban setting.

'Excalibur is considered a true precision weapon, impacting at a radial miss distance of six metres from the target.

'By using Excalibur's level of precision there is a major dramatic reduction in the time, cost and logistical burden traditionally associated with using artillery munitions.

'Analyses have shown that on average it takes at least 10 conventional munitions to accomplish what one Excalibur can.'

Raytheon adds that 'Excalibur provides these benefits while offering the most flexible artillery solution for reducing collateral damage'.

Precision-guided weaponry has become increasingly important to the U.S. military as it adapts to what has been dubbed 'assymetric' warfare against guerilla-type insurgent enemies like the Taliban in Afghanistan.

Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon had sales of $24billion last year and employs around 68,000 people worldwide.

Its other products range from ship-mounted anti-missile laser guns to 'extreme-scale' analytics software designed to data mine social networks for users' personal information.

The YouTube clip showing off Excalibur has been viewed more than 58,000 times and has attracted 73 'likes' and five 'dislikes'. Comments were turned off on the video's YouTube page.
