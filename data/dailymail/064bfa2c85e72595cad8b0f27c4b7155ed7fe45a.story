A New York clothing tycoon who confessed an affair to his wife after suspecting he had been caught cheating on camera, is taking his landlord to court.

George Otero is hoping to squeeze millions out of his landlord on the claim that his privacy was breached.

He claims his marriage was ruined by a small camera that - unbeknownst to him - had been set up across the hall and may have caught him having an affair.

Luxury living: George Otero lived in this West Village apartment with his wife Georgia

The camera was placed there by landlord 
Chaim Babad to confirm whether the building located at 241 Avenue of the
 Americas in the city’s West Village was Otero’s primary residence, 
Babad’s lawyer Jordan Sklar admitted in State Supreme Civil Court.

The New York Daily News reported
 that the camera, recording all the comings and goings at Otero's place,
 may have captured an extramarital affair that Otero had been having 
while his wife worked at his clothing business a few blocks north of the
 apartment.

In 2010 Otero discovered that a small box across the hall was actually a spy cam - pointed right at his door.

It is unclear if the camera had picked up his dalliances, but concerned that the film may caught him cheating on his wife Georgia, Otero decided to confess the affair to her.

Otero's lawyer Leonard Flamm told the Daily News: 'George concluded that Babad had the woman on camera and therefore it would come out.'

'He decided to inform his wife of 
this visitor. He wanted to break it to her rather than have her learn it
 from third parties. He felt it would better if the story came from 
him.'

Their marriage has been anything but blissful ever since, Flamm told the paper.

But while the Oteros may be on the outs, that’s not stopping them from joining forces in a huge lawsuit against Babad.

The couple is demanding $5million each from Babad, as well as $10,000 a year in psychiatric care, $2,500 a month for another apartment and $42,000 a year to pay for the employee Otero was hired to replace his wife, who quit her job when he told her of the affair.

The paper reported that despite the ongoing case, the camera is still there.

In court papers obtained by the News, Babad's lawyer Jordan Sklar said: 'If (Otero) wished to engage in intimate sexual activity in the open doorway of their apartment that is connected to a common hallway, he cannot reasonably expect that such conduct remains "private."'
