Jane Whittington, 58, died after a freak wave hit while she was enjoying a dip on holiday in Goa

A British grandmother drowned after being swept away by a freak wave during an exotic luxury holiday in India.

Jane Whittington, 58, was on a four-month break in the resort of Goa with her partner Steve Cooper when the tragedy hit.

And sadly, the former carer never got to meet her newborn granddaughter, Betsy, who arrived while she was on her dream holiday.

Ms Whittington, from Birley, Sheffield, and her partner, as well as her sister and brother-in-law, who were also on the trip, had been out a boat for a fishing trip before having a beach massage.

She then decided to cool off with a dip in the sea with Mr Cooper, but got into difficulty and was carried out by a freak wave.

Mr Cooper battled the rough conditions to rescue Ms Whittington,  and tried in vain to save her.

The couple were due to return home this weekend, but instead she was cremated in Goa earlier this week.

Paying tribute, her family said they were devastated at the loss of Ms Whittington, who 'lived life to the full'.

Daughter Donna McGrail, 40, son Max Ellis, 37 and five grandchildren, are now planning to return later in the year to scatter her ashes.

Mr Ellis's partner Kirstie Barber, said: 'All we know is she had a lovely day on a fishing trip, had a massage on a beach, went swimming and then a wave took her. 

'Steve managed to get her out of the water but could not save her.'

The couple were on holiday in the same resort they had visited for years, which Ms Whittington called her 'second home'. 

 Ms Barber added: 'She loved it over there, she called it her second home and each time she went she stayed for longer and longer.

'Jane said that if she ever passed away over there it was a nice place to die and her wish was to stay there, which is why her ashes will be scattered there.

'Jane loved it there, she loved the easy, relaxed way of life. She felt part of the community and volunteered at a dog rescue place.' 

She added: 'She lived every day like it was going to be her last. Everyone is devastated, absolutely devastated.'

The family are planning to celebrate her life at a gathering at The New Inn in Gleadless, on March 14.
