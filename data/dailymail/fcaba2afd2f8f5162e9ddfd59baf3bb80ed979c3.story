Politicians of all parties have voted Margaret Thatcher the most successful prime minister since the Second World War.

The Iron Lady was valued for her decisiveness, with most MPs citing this as a more important trait than principles, honesty or intelligence.

Mrs Thatcher, who spent 11 years at No10,  beat Labour’s Clement Attlee, who oversaw the creation of the NHS.

Dr Nicholas Allen, senior lecturer in politics at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: ‘The Iron Lady remain divisive, idolised by some, condemned by others.’ 

Tony Blair came third in the poll of 158 MPs by the university’s politics department.

Winston Churchill came fourth when judged on his second term from 1951 to 1955.

Of the 13 post-war PMs, excluding David Cameron, Gordon Brown came last

Of the MPs who took part, 69 were Tories, 67 Labour, 14 Lib Dem and eight from other parties.

Of the 13 post-war PMs, excluding David  Cameron, Gordon Brown came last.

Party affiliation was generally the strongest predictor of a leader’s success.

The exception to the rule was Edward Heath, the Conservative PM who took Britain into Europe.Heath was unseated by Thatcher as party leader in 1975 and was rated more highly by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs than by Conservatives.

Dr Allen added: 'It’s not surprising that MPs perceive Thatcher, Attlee and Blair to be the most successful prime ministers.

'Attlee and Thatcher both presided over fundamental shifts in British politics, while Blair, like Thatcher, was a proven election winner.

'When it comes to winning big majorities, David Cameron still has much to prove.'
