A disabled builder lived in a Scottish cave for five months after he was allegedly kicked out of his one-bedroom flat by a housing association.

Cameron Logan, 50, and his partner Elaine survived in the 12ft deep rocky outcrop in Oban from May to September with just two sleeping bags to keep them warm.

The former construction worker, who relies on crutches to walk, said living in the 15ft wide cave left him at his 'lowest ebb' as he struggled with the cold and wet conditions.

A disabled builder and his partner, Elaine, lived in a Scottish cave for five months after he was kicked out of his one-bedroom flat

'In this day and age, having to live in a cave is just not right. I'm amazed we survived,' he said.

'Two people don't deserve to have to live in a cave. It was only our love for one another that kept us going after everyone else let us down.'

Mr Logan was a resident at Ross House homeless accommodation in Oban for more than two years prior to his ordeal.

But after breaching the terms of his tenancy by offering Elaine - who herself was sleeping rough - shelter in his one-bedroom apartment, the pair were kicked out, according to Mr Logan.

With no other home available, the only safe haven they could find was a cave off a popular dog-walking route overlooking Oban bay.

'I've always been from the area so I knew the cave was there,' said Mr Logan.

'It was all we had and our only option - the only place we could go if we hoped to survive. We slept in sleeping bags with our heads poking out of the front of the cave.

'We found some wooden panels which we used to sit on and we were given some rugs too, to keep us warm.

'But it was so uncomfortable. Just imagine yourself what it's like sleeping in a cave every night.

'As well as the problems I have with my legs, I've got depression too.

'Both were made so much worse by living in that cave and I found myself turning to alcohol more than ever before. Life in the cave left me at my lowest point.'

The cave's walls were covered in insects and cobwebs with rainwater - which would blow in during the night - seeping in through cracks in its stone ceiling.

Cameron said: 'We'd wake up every morning with the bells going at the church and go down to use their toilet. Sometimes my legs would be so bad though that I'd struggle to walk that far and just have to go in the trees beside the cave.

Mr  Logan and his partner Elaine had to use public bathrooms to wash themselves and use the toilet 

'We had no showers and had to wash under the taps in the local public halls just to make ourselves clean.

'Nothing about it was hygienic. It was no way for a man and a woman to live.'

The couple, who have now moved to Helensburgh, were helped by long-term friends Stephen Kelly and his partner Ashley McGuire, both 50. 

Mr Kelly said: 'Cammy would get stuck in the cave. His legs are degenerating so at times he struggles to move at all.

'There were times he couldn't even make it up the small incline to the cave, so would have to just sleep in the trees.

'We'd go and visit him first thing in the morning just to see that he was surviving.'

The Blue Triangle Housing Association said that they do not comment on specific cases.

A spokesman for Argyll and Bute Council said: 'There are many different reasons why people find themselves homeless. We would encourage anyone in this situation to come to our Homeless Service offices.'
