Lost: A mystery teenager who does not know his name, age or nationality has been discovered after he escaped traffickers (posed by model)

A mystery foreign teenager who does not know his name, age or nationality and has never been to school has been found in a city centre, a charity said today.

The young man is believed to have fled a house he was trafficked to in London when he was a small child and was discovered at a bus station in Coventry.

The mystery youth - believed in be in his late teens - heard someone speaking a language he understood and asked for help, and they put him in touch with staff at the Coventry Refugee and Migrant Centre.

All he had in his possession when he arrived in the Midlands was a letter from a solicitor saying he was 'stateless'.

He told staff he did not know his name, age, or country of origin.

He said he had been trafficked into the country.

Paul Wheeler, from the charity, said: 'As far as we can tell he could have fallen out of the sky.

'He doesn't know his own name or his country of origin. We don't know how long he has been in the UK - all we know is that he tells us he got on a bus in London and arrived in Coventry.'

He speaks Urdu, Hindi and basic English and says he came to the UK when he was around six years old and has been kept in a house in London.

He told the centre's safeguarding unit that he was not allowed outside and he did not go to school.

Mr Wheeler said: 'He thinks he came to the UK when he was six because 'the lady in the house' told him that.

'But when we gently asked what had gone on in the house, he became very nervous and as of now has said nothing.

'We have no idea how old he is.'

Found: The young man heard a language he recognised in the Pool Meadow Bus Station in Coventry (pictured), and he was then put in contact with a refugee charity

It is understood he has tried to seek asylum in Britain.

The young man has not been working illegally in Coventry and was not asked to come to the city - he simply arrived here on November 11.

Because he is stateless it means he is unable to register with a number of bodies in the UK.

He cannot see a doctor or get help from a number of different agencies.
