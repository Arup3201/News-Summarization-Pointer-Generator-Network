One quirky pet owner has snapped a series of pictures showing her bearded dragon talking part in some very human tasks.

Pringle is the beloved pet of 23-year-old Sophie, who has captured her lizard friend in a variety of hilarious situations.

Sophie, from Melbourne, bought Pringle - now four - from a reptile store when he was just one month old and has since snapped him riding a bicycle, wearing a top hat, snuggled up in a knitted scarf and even playing video games.

The first photograph Pringle ever posed for was one snuggled up to a miniature teddy bear, and when it became popular on  Facebook Sophie set out to snap as many interesting pictures of Pringle as a she could.

'I first started taking funny photos of him when I posed him with a tiny teddy bear and put it on Facebook. The photo got a lot of likes so I continued thinking of different photos after that', owner Sophia said.

'He will do everything I pose him with: riding a bike, having a tea party, doing the shopping. It is so much fun and he really enjoys it!' 

Pringle is partial to some food, and enjoys a tea party so long as he has his white napkin on hand

Not always after the treats, the bearded dragon also enjoys a fruit platter of apples, pears, peaches and cherries

One of his favourite accessories is his delicate silver Monopoly top hat

Pringle likes to spend his down-time playing video games on his mini Gameboy

Sophie has snapped Pringle lounging around in his pretty pastel pink dressing gown

He also very much enjoys a tea party with his green tea set

Pringle has also been captured pushing a shopping trolley, riding a skateboard and of course, posing with a packet of Pringles. 

On occasions the bearded dragon has been snapped packing up his bags and posing on top of a suitcase, dressed up in a kilt and hat, wearing his miniature crossbow and arrow and getting into the Christmas.

Getting cosy in his dressing gown, turning the camera on his owner Sophie, enjoy some of his favourite fruits and even the casual drink are also among Pringle's most common activities.

Sophie believes her reptile friend has a very special talent, and is a very friendly pet. 

'He's very talented. Everybody who meets him ends up loving him, even people who don't like reptiles very much,' she said. 

'He's very gentle and is great with kids.'

Pringle is an adventurous reptile and a big fan of Katniss from the Hunger Games, as evident here with with cross and bow

His owner Sophie describes him as a very friendly lizard, and good with children

Sometimes when he's had enough Pringle packs up his little suitcase and threatens to leave
