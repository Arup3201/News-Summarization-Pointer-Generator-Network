Monaco have unveiled their new coach - and Leonardo Jardim must be thrilled at the opportunity to work with Colombian sensation James Rodriguez.

Jardim has signed a two-year deal at the principality club and takes over from Claudio Ranieri who was sacked at the end of last season, despite guiding Monaco to second in the table.

Rodriguez was a £40million signing for Monaco from Porto in 2013 and has scored 12 goals in 38 games so far for the club.

Revelation: James Rodriguez has been brilliant at the World Cup and Sporting will want to keep hold of him

Picking a pass: Rodriguez has scored five goals at the World Cup to lead the race for the Golden Boot

Expectation: Jardim will be expected to compete with Paris Saint-Germain in the league this year

And he has lit up the World Cup in Brazil - scoring five goals to lead the race for the Golden Boot and impressing with his all-round play.

It will be tough for Jardim to keep a hold of the 22-year-old striker but he will be keen to do so and he will get straight to work on that.

Jardim guided Sporting Lisbon to second place in 2013-14 during his only season in charge of the club.

The 39-year-old Portuguese has previously managed Olympiacos, Braga, Beria-Mar, Chaves and Camacha.

Jardim will be expected to compete with Paris Saint-Germain, who won Ligue 1 for the second year in a row.
