Police have today released this horrifying picture of a woman who had acid thrown in her face by a stranger on her doorstep, as she begged for the public's help to catch the 'coward' who did it.

Tara Quigley, 28, opened her door in Romford, London, to a man who tossed the corrosive chemical all over her upper body before running away.

Her dog, which she was carrying at the time, was blinded and may have to be put down.

Speaking for the first time today Miss Quigley, who is being treated in a specialist burns unit for her extensive injuries said: 'I don't understand why this has happened to me'.

Victim: Tara Quigley, 28, has been pictured for the first time since an acid attack and today asked the public to help police catch the 'coward' who did it

Wanted: Scotland Yard says this is the man they want to find, as he is alleged to have tossed corrosive chemicals in Tars's face when she opened her front door in Romford, London

Scotland Yard has today also released an efit of the suspect they are hunting for.

The 28-year-old victim, whose face and body is covered in acid burns, said: 'I feel devastated and am coming to terms with the fact I might have to bear the scars of this cowardly attack for the rest of my life.

'I was at home with my family at the time. It doesn't bear thinking about that this could have been one of the children instead of me as the man didn't even look up when threw it at me.

'He is a coward. Please call the police if you know anything at all.'

Acid: The front door of the terraced property has been stained by the unidentified liquid which was thrown in the victim's face

A stain was still visible on the door
of the two-storey terraced house where she was 
attacked shortly after 9pm on Tuesday.

Miss
Quigley, who neighbours say lived in the house with her sister and two 
young children, opened her front door to a man
asking for ‘Michelle’.

He left, but returned half an hour later and threw an unidentified substance at her, believed to be acid.

Tara slammed the door and rushed to a sink where she washed her face with water.

Minutes later she was heard groaning in agony and calling out for help as she was taken to hospital by ambulance.

Detectives described the suspect as 
white, short and about 20 years old. He was wearing black clothing.

DC Paul Swift from Romford CID said: 'This was a craven attack during which the victim suffered substantial 
injuries. If you know anything or saw the incident I would urge you to 
come forward.

'Did you perhaps see a man loitering nearby around the time of the 
incident? It is possible the attacker sustained burns injuries as a 
result of handling these chemicals - do you know anyone who has being 
trying to cover up any such injuries?'

Attack: Tara's elder sister Tina said she is in a 'bad way' following the attack with burns to around a third of her face

Victim: Tara, 28, was attacked when she opened her frontdoor by a mystery attacker in Romford

Home: The terraced property in Romford which Tara shares with her sister Tina

Last week her sister, 30-year-old Tina Quigley, said: ‘She’s in a bad way. About a third of her face was badly burned. She’s finding it very tough and struggling to come to terms with it.

‘It’s really bad. We fear she’s going to be left really badly damaged. I have been with her at the hospital ever since it happened. We just have no idea why anyone would want to do this.’

Any witnesses or anyone with any information should call Havering CID on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
