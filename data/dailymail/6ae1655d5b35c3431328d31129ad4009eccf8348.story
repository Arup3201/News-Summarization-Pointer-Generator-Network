Red squirrels could make a comeback in the English countryside thanks to the pine marten, which preys on their grey cousins.

The hard-up animals are much faster than grey squirrels, allowing the ferret-like pine martens to feast on them more easily.

Since the introduction of grey squirrels from America in the 19th century, huge numbers of reds have been wiped out across England due to competition.

There are currently between 120,000 and 140,000 red squirrels in the UK compared to over four million grey squirrels.

But a study in Ireland found that rising numbers of pine martens has led to a decrease in grey squirrel numbers, once again allowing reds to thrive.

Since receiving protection under the Irish Wildlife Act in 1976, the country's pine marten population has grown, but the animal is uncommon in England.

Experts say that if the little-known creature is introduced it could lead to a swell in red squirrel numbers on these shores.

The study by the University of Galway found that red squirrels were spotted in areas where pine martens flourish.

Researchers studied pine marten faeces which showed the animals regularly 
ate grey squirrels but hardly any reds.

Reintroduction: Experts say introducing the pine marten, which hunts grey squirrels more easily, could lead to a rise in the red squirrel population

This is because reds spend most of their time in trees and are smaller and more agile than their relatives.

The latest figures suggest there are as few as 120 pine martens, who also eat field voles, small birds, wood mice and frogs, left in England and Wales.

Scotland has around 3,500, having been granted protection in 1987, and is also home to about 75 per cent of the UK red squirrel population.

Belonging to the mustelid family, which also includes minks, otters, badgers, wolverines and weasels, the pine marten is about the size of a domestic cat.

Dr Colin Lawton, lecturer in zoology at the University of Galway, said: 'The reason reds have disappeared throughout Great Britain and Ireland is because of the competition from the greys.

'But what we have seen here is when there are higher numbers of pine martens in an area the number of greys go down, as pine marten eat the greys.

'Reds and pine martens have lived together for thousands of years and have existed together quite happily.

'A possible conservation tool could be to introduce more pine martens to return the reds (in England) to their former glory.'

Janet Wickens, director of the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, welcomed the results, saying: 'To have a natural predator for greys would really help but there would be an awful lot of people not happy with the introduction of pine martens into the countryside.'

Lizzie Croose, project support officer at The Vincent Wildlife Trust, which studies pine martens, said: 'It's great that pine martens are recovering and if their recovery has a positive impact on the red squirrel that is really good news.

'Pine martens are native to all of Britain and in areas where they are absent their absence has an effect on that eco-system - there is less pressure on the grey squirrels, they flourish and make life harder for the red squirrel.'
