Golfer Colin Montgomerie was violent towards his ex-wife Eimear, the phone hacking trial was told yesterday.

His former wife said she had told then Sun editor Rebekah Brooks about a ‘violent event’ in a hotel room when the women had met for lunch.

Eimear Cook, who has since remarried, claimed that, during the conversation, Brooks, 45, had described how she was herself arrested over an alleged assault on her ex-husband, actor Ross Kemp.

Mrs Cook, 43, told the Old Bailey that the newspaper boss had gone on to discuss how it was ‘easy’ to hack phones.

In a dramatic courtroom exchange, Mrs Cook was accused of lying in her evidence and was asked if she had a ‘vendetta’ against Brooks. Mrs Cook sued the News of the World after discovering her phone was hacked, but she denied she had lied about Brooks to support her civil claim for damages.

Mrs Cook met Brooks for lunch in 2005 following her split from Ryder Cup captain Montgomerie, 50.

She told police: ‘[Brooks] was quite a frank and open person, she told us about the assault on her husband Ross Kemp, how the police had been called and that it had made it into the papers.’

She went on: ‘I can’t remember how the subject of phone hacking came up... Rebekah said she couldn’t believe how these incredibly wealthy people didn’t change their factory-set Pins and how stupid their PAs were for not telling them to change their Pins.

‘She gave an example involving Paul McCartney and Heather Mills. She said that it was through listening to voicemails that it was found out that he had thrown her engagement ring from the  balcony of a New York hotel room several floors up.’

The prosecution allege the conversation shows Brooks was aware of phone hacking, a claim she denies. Jonathan Laidlaw QC, for Brooks, accused Mrs Cook of lying about the conversation in September 2005, and told her: ‘This never happened.’

Mrs Cook denied lying and said she recalled vividly how Brooks had laughed as she talked about coverage of her alleged assault on Kemp. The lawyer told her: ‘It’s not just a suggestion that it never happened, it couldn’t have happened, it’s quite impossible for this to have happened.

‘Mrs Brooks was not the subject of an accusation of an assault on Ross Kemp until November 2005... this event had not happened, it wouldn’t happen for another few weeks.’

Mr Laidlaw added: ‘I suggest  what happened was you told Mrs Brooks your ex-husband Mr Montgomerie had been violent towards you in your marriage.’ ‘Yes I did,’ she replied.

She agreed she had told Brooks there was ‘something of a record of this violent event’ taking place in a hotel room. But she denied she had asked the tabloid editor if she could run an article about it, or discussed giving an affidavit to support such an article.

Mrs Cook insisted she had tried not to speak to journalists – but was confronted with articles apparently based on interviews with her, including two spreads in Hello! and a series of articles in the Daily Mail.

She said the Hello! interview was given while she was married to Montgomerie and accepted a level of public interest, and said the Mail articles were based on comments made to journalists at society events. She also conceded she had accepted several commissions from the Mail on Sunday to write travel features.

Brooks and others deny conspiracy to hack phones. The trial continues.
