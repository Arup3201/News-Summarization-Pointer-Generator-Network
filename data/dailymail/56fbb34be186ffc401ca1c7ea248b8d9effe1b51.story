Eleven people died and 27 others are missing after torrential rains battered southwest China's Chongqing, a municipality in the upper reaches of the Three Gorges Dam, causing thousands of houses to collapse, state media said

Heavy rains are pushing water levels at the Three Gorges Dam past the flood level limit. Sluice gates of the world's biggest hydropower project were opened earlier today

It is being reported that the miners were in a four-story dormitory building when the landslide hit. Fifteen of them managed to escape but the rest were buried in a mine shaft where they had been taking shelter, according to state television.

It is thought rescue workers were able to save one miner who was sent to a local hospital where he remained in stable condition.

Rain began to lash the southwest region on Sunday and firefighters and police have been assisting to evacuate thousands of people from nine flooded towns in the Yunyang county. 

Roads were turned to rivers as motorists struggled to stop their cars from being washed away and fleets of vehicles were left abandoned in the town square.

Some pedestrians waded knee-deep in rainwater with family members on their backs as they struggled to get through the flood water.

Chongqing city shopkeeper Ye Wu, 54, interviewed on local TV, said: ‘It looked more like Venice than Chongqing. All the buildings looked like they were built on a lake.

‘All it needed was a few blokes with poles on boats and there would be no difference.’ 

Ye Hsu, police spokesman in the emergency task force co-ordinating the flood control work, said: ‘The rainfall was extremely heavy and no matter how prepared you are, extreme weather like this is hard to deal with.

‘People were urged to find high ground and stay there until the authorities found them.’

Landslides formed two barrier lakes on the Yangtze River in Fengjie County, where water levels rose three feet every hour, according to local flood control officers.

The area has been battered by thunderstorms and rain over the last two days and thousands of people have had to be evacuated from their homes for safety

More than 1,000 residents have been evacuated from the surrounding area.

The news agency said a total of 2,251 houses had collapsed in the rainstorms, while 25,000 more homes have been damaged.

It also estimated that the economic loss in Yunyang alone was in the region of £6,000,000 or $11million. 

Officials from the State Flood Control bureau in the capital Beijing say that since the start of the year, 377 people in China have died in floods and 94 are missing.
