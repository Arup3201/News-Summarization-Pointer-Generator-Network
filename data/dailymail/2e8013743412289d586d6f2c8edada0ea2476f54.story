For so long, it looked like Rangers were sleepwalking into the eye of a storm on Friday night. With the clock ticking down at Westfield, Ally McCoist’s team were staring at the nightmare prospect of being potentially five points off the pace after just two league fixtures.

Just when the team looked like stumbling again, however, young talent Lewis Macleod provided a late intervention that again proved the old adage that it’s better to be lucky than good.

At the end of another desperately poor performance, the 20-year-old’s deflected strike off Alan Maybury 12 minutes from time unlocked a home defence that had been untroubled all evening.

Falkirk’s resistance broken, substitute Nicky Clark secured all three points by turning home a second, pinching what looked a certain goal by Nicky Law, and adding gloss to a scoreline that Rangers’ overall play ill-deserved.

For all the visitors’ celebrations at full time, deep down McCoist will know that on another night — one when goalkeeper Cammy Bell wasn’t in such inspired form amid a Falkirk siege — this could have been the precursor to a morning full of crisis headlines.

Pressure had been mounting on the manager coming into this match after his team made heavy weather of beating 10-man Hibs in extra time in the Petrofac Training Cup before opening their league campaign with a 2-1 home defeat to Hearts.

However, if McCoist was under some scrutiny so, too, were his underperforming players.

All eyes were on Bilel Mohsni on his return after a two-match ban for a ridiculous flying head-butt on Scotland international striker Chris Martin during a pre-season friendly against Derby County.

Up front, there was also a lot expected of front-pairing Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd. The pair entered this game without a competitive goal to their name since their return, although Boyd expressed confidence earlier this week that he can bag 25 goals this season.

Peter Houston’s Falkirk team, who hope to make the play-offs, were unchanged from the side who battled back to draw 2-2 at Cowdenbeath on the opening day of the season.

Such was the demand for this sell-out game, local kids were spotted climbing trees behind the west stand at Westfield to catch a glimpse of their favourites.

And their youthful invention was initially mirrored by the Bairns on the park as Blair Alston dispossessed Darren McGregor and crossed just too far ahead of Tom Taiwo.

Then young winger Alex Cooper’s cross caused consternation in the Rangers box, with Alston’s flick evading keeper Bell but landing on the wrong side of the Rangers post.

The action started to peter out disappointingly, however, with Rangers once again looking sluggish, lacking in invention and appearing devoid of confidence. That was most evident when Macleod angered Boyd with a slack through-ball to the striker.

In what was an increasingly poor first half, Rangers did threaten when Mohsni’s header from a Macleod corner hit David McCracken and flew up over the bar.

Then, from the cleared corner, David Templeton’s 25-yard rocket flew just wide.

At the other end, however, there was to be a real escape for the Ibrox side when Cooper intercepted the erratic Mohsni’s short back header and hared down on Bell’s goal.

The French-born Tunisian redeemed himself with a sliding tackle, before his arm went up in apology to his angry team-mates.

But he continually gave the ball away and, after being booked for clipping Alston 25 yards out, he was relieved to see the Falkirk midfielder’s free-kick curl wide.

For Rangers, the second half continued in much the same depressing pattern as the first. The again looked out of sorts

To the annoyance of Law and Lee McCulloch, Mohsni and Marius Zaliukas persisted in shelling forward long balls, bypassing the midfield, which were mopped up with ease by the Falkirk defence.

Mohsni was then lucky to escape a second yellow for a foul on Conor McGrandles on the edge of the box.

This time, he was sprung from jail by Bell, who saved a terrific free-kick by Cooper.

The Rangers keeper’s next save from the resulting corner — stopping a towering header by McCracken — was even better and very much from the top drawer.

Falkirk were on top by now, but their former Hibs midfielder Taiwo was lucky to escape a booking for a foul on Mohsni.

Then, in a bid to inject some desperately-needed life into his listless side, McCoist sent on striker Clark for Miller, who looked to have picked up a knock. Such was the utter lack of creativity, however, Rangers could have sent on McCoist in his playing prime to no effect.

When a spell of Rangers possession finally ensued, a fine chance presented itself for McCulloch.

A weak headed clearance bounced up perfectly on the penalty spot, only for the Ibrox captain to blaze wildly over the bar.

There was an immediate scare at the other end of the park when Falkirk’s Rory Loy raced down the right, but his centre narrowly missed Alston and Cooper.

Substitute Clark missed the chance of the night, though, when Boyd chipped a pass beautifully into the path of the former Queen of the South striker on the six-yard box — but he headed weakly at Jamie MacDonald.

It was the Falkirk keeper’s first save of the match, which told its own story.

But then came Macleod and Clark’s two late goals in six minutes to save the day for McCoist.

In a frantic finish, Boyd also hit the net but his drought continues thanks to an offside flag.

It mattered little to Rangers and their manager after what was a lucky escape.
