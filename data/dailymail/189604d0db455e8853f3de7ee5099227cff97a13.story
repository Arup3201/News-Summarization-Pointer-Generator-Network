Gone are the days when women constantly worried about their looks, a new study suggests.

For the modern British woman is now so confident in her appearance that she thinks she looks five years younger than she really is.

Most women do not believe they look old until the age of 46, and feel confident about their appearance into their fifties and beyond, according to a survey.

Three-quarters of the 2,000 women surveyed said they looked five years younger than their real age, mostly thanks to a youthful complexion.

One in ten respondents believed they looked a decade younger than they really were, while a third said they would happily embrace growing old.

The study, commissioned by cosmetics brand Lancome Advanced Genifique, suggested that some women - around 10 per cent - were concerned about ageing as early as their twenties.

Nearly 40 per cent said their concerns began in their thirties. The average age when the worries started, however, was 46.

One in five women said concerns about looking old had started in their 50s or 60s, suggesting older women are more content with their looks than they were in their youth.

Respondents said the secret to eternal youth included a happy marriage, avoiding getting sunburnt, using a good moisturiser, good genes and eating five pieces of fruit a day.

Regular haircuts, daily exercise, religiously cleansing, toning and moisturising, good eye cream and never smoking were also crucial in the fight against ageing, they said.

A glass of wine at the weekend, surrounding themselves with young people and having well-behaved children were among the other answers given.

British actress Helen Mirren, 68, was the celebrity most admired for her youthful appearance, followed by comedian Joanna Lumley, 68, Pretty Woman star Julia Roberts, 46, and singing sensation Lulu, 65.

Italian and French women were considered the most likely nationalities to retain a youthful appearance, followed by those from Scandinavia.

Women from Russia, Germany and Ireland scored the lowest.

Nearly half of respondents said they spent up to £60 a year on cosmetics which they hoped would make them look younger, 38 per cent spend between £60 and £150 and 12 per cent spent between £150 and £250.

Three per cent of women said they spent more than £250 a year on skincare products aimed at beating the clock.
