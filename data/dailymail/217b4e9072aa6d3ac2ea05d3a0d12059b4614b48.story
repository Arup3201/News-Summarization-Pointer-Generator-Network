Her children were left devastated after her husband - their father - passed away from lung cancer.

So one Canadian mother found a way to keep his spirit alive - by making pillows out of his clothes.  

Using her late spouse's flannel shirts, the mother created memorial pillows, before attaching heartfelt notes 'from Dad' to the fabric. She then gave them to her two children as gifts on Christmas Day.

Touching: A Canadian mother created this memorial pillow from her late husband's flannel shirt. She then fixed a note to it, reading: 'This is a shirt I used to wear. And when you hold it I’ll be there. Love Dad xoxo'

One of the notes, written on brown paper by the woman's sister-in-law and sewn onto the pillow via a piece of string, reads: 'This is a shirt I used to wear. And when you hold it I’ll be there. Love Dad xoxo.'

On Monday, one of the children posted a photo of their pillow to Reddit, saying: 'My father passed away from lung cancer in July. Mom had these gifts made for me and my brother.'

The user, known only as Velaniswin, later uploaded a picture of their brother's pillow, as well as an image of their father donning the same flannel shirt that was used to create the keepsake.

The photo of the first pillow, which Velaniswin described as 'the best gift I've ever received', was then shared on Parentdish Canada's Facebook page, where it has been 'liked' more than 166,000 times.

'Thoughtful': On Monday, one of the children posted a photo of their pillow to Reddit. It was later shared on Parentdish Canada's Facebook page, where it was deemed 'sweet' and 'creative' by many users (pictured)

User Audrey Puntureri Phillips, from Pennsylvania, wrote: 'My mouth fell open when I saw this! How incredibly thoughtful, exceptionally sweet, and very creative besides!!'

Subscribers also shared their own photos of memorial objects that have been crafted from passed loved one's clothes - dubbed the practice of 'upcycling' - including bears, blankets and quilts.
