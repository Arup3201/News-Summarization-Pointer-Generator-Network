Phil Neville insists under-fire Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is the right man to take the club forward despite their poor start to the season.

The Merseysiders have failed to reach the dizzy heights of last season's impressive second placed finish, as they currently lie 18 points off the leaders Chelsea in 12th position.

However, Neville is not overly surprised by the slump in Liverpool's form, believing too much was expected of their squad at the beginning of the season. 

Phil Neville didn't hold back when discussing Liverpool's current woes on Match of the Day

Brendan Rodgers has a heap of problems with Liverpool only winning twice in the league since August 

Speaking on Match of the Day he said: 'There were unrealistic targets set for Liverpool this season, especially with Luis Suarez leaving the club.

'Without him (Suarez) last season they would have finished seventh at the end of the day.

'And now without him they are around about where they have been for the four seasons prior to last when they were second.

'Liverpool have consistently finished in the Europa League positions and when I look at their squad now that's where I think they'll finish.

'I still think he (Rodgers) is the right man for the job though and should be given more time, but understandably at the moment he is under pressure.'

Despite stating that Rodgers needs more time to turn Liverpool's fortunes around, he does think the former Swansea manager must stop making excuses for his side's poor form.

Some of the reasons the Northern Irishman has cited for their demise include the lack of experience in the Reds squad, as well as their on-going involvement in Europe, but Neville has rejected such claims.  

He added: 'I don't understand the excuses made about Liverpool's season being disrupted by playing in Europe. It's actually a lot easier competing in the Champions League than the Europa League.

'This is especially the case in terms of preparation and recovery, as you can be travelling a lot further away while playing in the Europa League as opposed to the Champions League.

'For me there's more than enough experience in that side too. I keep hearing that this Liverpool side is a young one but the average age of the team against Crystal Palace was 26, and for a Premier League side that isn't young at all.

'A lot of these players have played in Europe as well, so should have the experience required to get themselves a win in these kind of games (against Crystal Palace).'

Neville has also not been impressed with the impact Rodgers' summer signings have made at the club, with £16million man Mario Balotelli in particular being singled out for notable criticism. 

'As a manager you live and die by your signings and at the moment I don't think his (Rodgers) signings have been good enough.'

Fellow pundit Kevin Kilbane reinforced this view, stating that only Daniel Sturridge and maybe Philippe Coutinho, could be classed as successful signings out of all of the players Rodgers has brought to the club, with £213million spent in the process, since taking over in 2012.
