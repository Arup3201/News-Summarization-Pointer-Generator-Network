FIFA have left themselves open to further accusations of corruption after insisting their £6million report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups would not be published.

Football Association officials will await an official explanation from the world governing body before issuing a response.

But Hans Joachim-Eckert, who chairs the adjudicatory chamber of Fifa’s ethics committee, has reportedly said he would not be allowing the findings of a 350-page report - compiled from 200,000 pages of evidence by New York attorney Michael Garcia – to ever be available to the public.

Eckert says not even the FIFA executive committee will be able to read the full report when it is finished

Joachim-Eckert, a judge in Munich, has told the Sunday Times that he and his deputy would be the only people to read the report and said that Fifa’s rules prohibited him from even showing it to Fifa president Sepp Blatter and the world governing body’s 27-man executive.

It means the accusations of bribery in the bidding process for the World Cup will remain unanswered; at least publicly.

It is something that is understood to have infuriated Garcia and John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, told the Sunday Times: ‘I’m absolutely horrified. 

Sepp Blatter is at the centre of the curruption scandal which saw the 2022 World Cup awarded to Qatar

'The one thing we’ve always been told by Fifa is that there would be a proper investigation and we should wait for the Garcia report. 

'But if the Garcia report is going to be buried so that we have no idea what the conclusions are, it will leave the reputation of Fifa in pieces. 

'It confirms what we have long suspected, that all Fifa is interested in is burying this whole matter and sweeping the evidence under the carpet.’

Lord Triesman, the former FA chairman who initially led the England bid to host the 2018 World Cup until his resignation seven months before the vote, said: ‘Fifa has a very long-standing culture of misbehaviour and complete secrecy — omerta is the word that comes to my mind — so in a way it’s not surprising that they won’t reveal the contents of the Garcia report. 

'But the most clear test of whether Fifa ever attempts to reform is whether it conducts investigations in a transparent way, publishes the details of the findings and deals with the problems in an equally transparent way. 

'Other than that, the culture will simply go on as it has done now for decades.’
