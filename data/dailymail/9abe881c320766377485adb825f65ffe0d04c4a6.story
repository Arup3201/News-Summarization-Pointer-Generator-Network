Climbing up the walls and splashing in the water, these brown bear cubs were the main attraction at this year's Enstone Country Show.

It seemed like delightful summer entertainment.

But the quaint fair in Oxford has been accused of animal cruelty for caging up the three wild cubs.

Animal cruelty? Activists have condemned Enstone Show for caging up three wild brown bear cubs

Get me out of here! The cubs climbed up the railings  after organisers decided to go ahead despite protests

Hundreds of families flock to the Enstone Fair in Oxfordshire every year for a fun fair, food market, and animal performances.

However, this summer animal rights activists have sent more than 2,000 emails to organisers to condemn the 'cruel' display of the animals from eastern Europe.  

The trio of cubs were loaned by Amazing Animals, a company which trains animals for film, television and circuses.

Last year, the firm was embroiled in a row with animal protection societies footage emerged of their lion cubs performing in a Japanese circus.

Condemning their inclusion at the event, Animal Defenders International (ADI) and the Captive Animals' Protection Society (CAPS) urged followers to ambush the event and email their complaints to the organisers.  

One of the shows organisers made a complaint to the police after receiving abusive emails and comments on social media.

Innocent entertainment? The bears were the main attraction at the Oxfordshire event splashing around

Last night, on the eve of the show, organisers said the brown bear cub was still set to appear through television handlers Amazing Animals as well as all the other planned stalls and events.

One of the organisers Kate Farquhar-Thomson said she had she had received more than 600 emails and had felt harassed because of the communications.

'Amazing Animals, who are bringing the bears along, are a perfectly professional company. We will be continuing with the event as normal,' she said.

'The bear cubs are not for entertainment they are for education.

'Some of the messages have been abusive but I'm trying not to take it personally.'

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police confirmed a complaint had been made but that the communications did not amount to threats.

'We have given appropriate advice to the complainant,' said the spokesman.

'If anything arises tomorrow we will attend and deal with it.'

Defence: Organisers said the bears were there for education not for entertainment

ADI Group president Jan Creamer said: 'Using wild animals for entertainment may appear harmless, but it is certainly no fun for animals like bears who are highly intelligent and have very specialised needs.'

The Captive Animals' Protection Society (CAPS) were tweeting supporters to turn up to the event to protest.

'Anyone in the #Oxfordshire area available to take part in peaceful demo against wild animal use at #enstoneshow on Sat 23, pls DM #circusban,' CAPS tweeted.

Vicki Morton tweeted '#enstoneshow @kateft Please, please do not exploit a bear cub at your show. Not acceptable in 2014.'

Babs Fitzgerald tweeted; '@kateft #EnstoneShow - Please cancel use of bear cub at your event! Wild animals do not belong in cruel captivity for human entertainment!'

Anger: Activists claimed the animals have very specific needs and cannot be caged up as they were

The European Brown Bear cubs are being supplied by Chipping Norton firm Amazing Animals, which trains animals for television and film and has provided circuses with animals.

Owner Jim Clubb refuted ADI's claims saying 'Chipping Norton Veterinary Hospital, and our film vet is the former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.

'He will be attending on Saturday.

'There will be three young bears who at no time will be touched or petted by members of the public.

'We have annually supplied young animals for this event to support our local community and resent being judged by radical groups like ADI.'

Animals including camels, reptiles, spiders and lions have previously appeared at the show.
