Roy Hodgson claimed Wayne Rooney can handle the pressure as he closes in on becoming England’s all-time leading goalscorer.

Rooney scored from the penalty spot during England’s 5-0 destruction of European minnows San Marino in their Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley, but missed several chances to add to his total of 42 goals.

Sir Bobby Charlton’s record of 49, plus Gary Lineker’s haul of 48 and Jimmy Greaves (44) are within sight for the Manchester United striker.

England ran out comfortable 5-0 winners against San Marino in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Thursday night

Rooney has now scored 42 goals for England, two less than Jimmy Greaves and seven off the record

Hodgson said: ‘The record won't play on his mind. We'd like to think, with the way he is and the footballer he is, he's got a good few years in him yet. 

‘There are plenty of games left. I don't think we should put any pressure on him to reach targets early. 

‘The important thing is he keeps playing well and doing a job for the team and working as hard as he did tonight.

‘He got in a lot of times. His runs were very good. He's a bit disappointed with the chip. He thought that was on. 

Joe Hart was effectively a spectator against San Marino, but fans voted him man of the match anyway

Jack Wilshere was the eventual recipient of the award, despite only getting 11 per cent of the vote

‘I'm more than happy with him. It was another good captain's performance, solid throughout.’ 

Although San Marino scored a clear own goal from Rooney’s deflected effort Hodgson joked that the England forward should have been given the goal.

He said: ‘I’d always back Rooney, but I guess we will have to wait for the UEFA verdict.’ 

Phil Jagielka opened the scoring for England in the 24th minute and Rooney scored from the spot before the break. Danny Welbeck scored after half-time, Andros Townsend added another and an own goal gave England victory in front of just over 60,000 supporters at Wembley.

England fans made their views known on the quality of opposition when they voted Joe Hart, who didn’t have one save to make, the Vauxhall man of the match.

Wilshere was joined by club team-mate Danny Welbeck who scored his country's third on Thursday night

Roy Hodgson said he was pleased with the result against San Marino, who, he claimed, had improved

Hodgson added: ‘I wouldn't disagree with Jack's award (as the official man of the match). 

‘His passing was outstanding in the second half and he didn't do too badly in the first half either. It was nice to see Adam Lallana again, those wonderful touches. 

‘We didn't always convert them, but we must have had seven or eight intricate moves in the penalty box but couldn't put them away.

‘I was pleased we won, pleased we got the job done, very pleased with the crowd who were terrific throughout: their mood, their buoyancy and determination to get some enjoyment from the game. 

‘That was a cause of satisfaction. We kept plugging away in the first half when it was difficult to break them down. 

Raheem Sterling continued his international education against sub-standard opposition

Like his Liverpool team-mate Sterling, Jordan Henderson was substituted at half time

‘Our tempo was up in the second half, because it was hard for them to keep going in that second half. 

‘It's an important job done and we can concentrate our efforts on the second game, in Estonia. 

‘We should stop being surprised in international football. If you happen to be called Spain, Russia or England, we can't expect we can go and beat whoever because we have more people than them.

‘San Marino were better this year, though as an amateur team it'll be a while before they win somewhere like Wembley, I hope.’ 

Hodgson took off two Liverpool players at half-time - Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson - but insists it had nothing to do with his public spat with Brendan Rodgers.

The England head coach added: ‘With the wealth of talent we have in attacking areas, it was nice today to take people like Sterling, Henderson and Welbeck off who might play an important role for us on Sunday.’
