Tragic: Police say Southeast Missouri State University student Bobby Christman was gunned down after engaging with an armed carjacker early Sunday

A 19-year-old was shot in the head and killed when he tried to stop robbers from taking his girlfriend's purse in downtown St. Louis, police say.

Authorities say Bobby Christman was unconscious when officers arrived early Sunday morning to the scene. He was taken to a hospital, where he later died.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the Southeast Missouri State University student was sitting inside a parked car with two other people. Authorities say a vehicle pulled up next to their car and a man got out with a handgun.

Police say the armed man opened a door and tried to grab a purse belonging to Christman's girlfriend, leading to a tug of war with the criminal.

'She offered some level of resistance,' said St. Louis Metropolitan Police Captain Michael Sack told Fox2Now. 'At that time the front right passenger had said something. He had made some kind of remark and at that time the suspect filed a single shot at that front right passenger.'

Christman's 17-year-old brother also witnessed the horrific murder.

According to KSDK, the suspects subsequently engaged police in a gunfight in nearby Washington Park.

Three suspects then escaped on foot. 

Now police are using evidence gathered from the silver getaway car, which they have recovered, to try and find clues to who killed Christman. 

Bullet casings were found inside and the car is being dusted for prints.

Perished: Authorities say Christman said something to the gunman, who then fired the shot that struck Christman. They say the gunman jumped into his silver car and fled. Christman would subsequently die in a hospital

Christman belonged to the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity at SEMU. His heartbroken fraternity brother Paul Wibbenmeyer said, 'We're going to miss a great role model...It just breaks my heart'

Police say the suspects' car had been stolen in a carjacking days before. They are looking to businesses in the area in hopes of finding footage of the thieves or a witness to their crimes.

Christman belonged to the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity at SEMU. His fraternity brother there Aaron Clite told KDKA he wasn't completely surprised to hear of Christman's bravery. 

'I was happy I got to see him in his final day. He was just such an amazing person. He fought, he held on and for someone to survive even an event like that and be able to hang on as long as he did, it was amazing. He fought for his life and he did it all the way to the end,' he said. 

Another fraternity brother, Paul Wibbenmeyer, told KFVS:

'We're going to miss a great role model,' he said. 'It just breaks my heart.'

Christman's university has also issued a statement on the tragedy.

Photos from Christman's Facebook reveal a fun loving teen whose adult life had only just begun. Among the family he left behind was a 14-year-old sister and 17-year-old brother who reportedly witnessed the crime

The incident occurred early Sunday morning on the streets of downtown St. Louis when a thief leaped from a stolen car and demanded Christman's girlfriend give up her purse

'This is a tragic loss of life and we deeply mourn the death of Robert. We ask that everyone keep his family in their thoughts and prayers,' executive director of university communications and marketing at Southeast Missouri State Jeff Harmon said.

Christman's father Bob Christman II told STLToday that his son died trying to protect his friend.

'He was very protective,' the Christman said. 'He had kind of a hard exterior but with a heart of gold.'

Christman also had a 14-year-old sister.

'We’re still kind of in shock,' said. 'It’s just such a senseless thing that happened.'

Brave: Friends and family remembered him as a brave man with a hard of gold. The teen's father believes he died trying to protect the female passenger
