A father-of-two who was given a mandatory 20-year prison sentence for firing a warning shot at a thug who threatened his family says he has lost everything and insists he did nothing wrong. 

Lee Wollard, 59, from Devenport, Florida, was given the lengthy term after a jury found him guilty of aggravated assault, shooting a firearm inside a building and child endangerment in 2008. 

The incident which led to his incarceration took place when the biologist, who used to work at Sea World, was having a nap but was woken by his 16-year-old daughter Sarah and her boyfriend fighting.

'Everything is gone': Lee Wollard, 59, from Devenport, Florida, was given the lengthy term after a jury found him guilty of aggravated assault, shooting a firearm inside a building and child endangerment in 2008

He and his wife Debbie had taken the 17-year-old in because he was homeless, but the relationship began to deteriorate. 

When Wollard heard a loud crash, he loaded his .357 and went into the room, firing into the wall to scare him off. It prompted the boy to leave straight away.

Speaking to CBS News, he said: 'We had tried calling the cops. We had tried doing everything. Nothing worked. Nothing.

'So I fire a warning shot into the wall, [and] I said, 'The next one is between your eyes'.'

After the teenager hurried from the property, the family thought their dilemma was over, but they were wrong.

Wollard was charged and then sentenced to 20 years in Florida state prison by Judge Donald Jacobson. 

 'And I was just like, 'What?'' recalled Wollard. 'You know, the blood just drained out of my head. I almost passed out.'

Scared: The father-of-two loaded his magnum when the boyfriend of her daughter Sarah (second left) started threatening her and his family. He fired a warning shot into the wall beside him

Cost: Six years into his prison term (pictured right with his wife Debbie during a visit) he insists he did nothing wrong but says the punishment is a 'bargain' because his family is alive because of his actions

An aggravated assault involving a firearm in Florida comes with a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years. Wollard was given a plea offer of probation and no jail time but he declined, convinced he was innocent. 

He said: 'It never dawned on me that I would lose, because I hadn't done anything wrong. I'd protected my family, and I didn't even hurt anybody. Everything is gone.'

The judge told him that he would not have given him such a length sentence if he hadn't been obligated to do so.

He said: 'It didn't matter that Lee Wollard was a first offender, or that no one was physically injured. In Florida, a conviction for aggravated assault involving a firearm means an automatic 20 years. That's the mandatory minimum sentence.

'I looked at him and told him, 'I would not be sentencing you to this term of incarceration, 20 years Florida state prison, if it were not for the fact that I was obligated under my oath as a judge to do so.' 

Decision: Wollard (pictured with his wife and two children) was given a plea offer by prosecutors but he declined because he was convinced he would win 

Prosecutors believe that mandatory sentencing laws prompt defendants to opt for a plea bargain rather than going through a lengthy trial. 

He said: 'It never dawned on me that I would lose because I haven't done anything wrong.

In Florida if you kill someone when standing your ground then you may face no prison time at all. 

If he serves the full sentence, Wollard will be let out in 2028, when he is 73-years-old. But he believes it is a 'bargain'.

'As bizarre as it sounds, if this is what the State of Florida requires of you to make sure your family is safe, I'm willing to do it,' he said. 'It's a bargain. I've got three family members, my two daughters and my wife, and they're alive. They're alive because of this. It's a bargain. Twenty years is a bargain.'
