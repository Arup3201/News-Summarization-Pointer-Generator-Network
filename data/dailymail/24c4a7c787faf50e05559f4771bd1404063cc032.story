Tax officials must not be given powers to seize money directly from people’s bank accounts because they are not competent enough, a banking chief has warned.

Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association, also said he had ‘real concerns’ that the proposals could breach people’s human rights.

His hard-hitting letter to Chancellor George Osborne is the latest twist in the growing controversy about a plan that has triggered ferocious opposition from accountants and MPs.

Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association (pictured), said he had ‘real concerns’ that the proposals to allow money to be seized from people's bank accounts could breach customers' human rights

Under the new powers, HM Revenue & Customs will be able to take cash directly from a current account, joint account or ISA to settle an unpaid tax bill.

Around 17,000 people a year will have money seized under the proposed new powers, known as the ‘direct recovery of debts’. Each will typically owe £5,800. 

But Mr Browne wrote: ‘For these proposals to work as intended, HMRC’s tax assessments, systems and processes would have to be sufficiently robust that the likelihood of HMRC mistakes in the application of these powers could be reduced to a negligible risk.

‘HMRC’s performance cannot yet be considered as sufficiently competent to wield an unchecked power this strong.’

Mr Browne raised fears that the proposals might contravene the Human Rights Act.

‘We have specific concerns about how the proposals would interplay with the Act,’ he wrote. ‘We are not persuaded that the rights of those affected by the proposals, including the vulnerable, family members and those erroneously affected, are sufficiently protected.’

HMRC says it will only target those who owe £1,000 or more and have been contacted at least four times. It argues that it is wrong to let a tiny minority, who can afford to pay their taxes but refuse to do so, to get away with it.

But the BBA fears HMRC will target not just ruthless tax dodgers, but also ‘a significant number of unintentionally non-compliant, vulnerable taxpayers’, such as the elderly.

Under the new powers, HM Revenue & Customs will be able to take cash directly from a current account, joint account or ISA to settle an unpaid tax bill and it is thought around 17,000 a year would be affected (file picture)

Mr Browne wrote: ‘We believe that the proposals could have a negative impact on the frail and vulnerable and could undermine public faith in the tax system.’

He also raised concerns that HMRC would be able to remove the money without the need to apply to a court.

In the Lords recently, Lib Dem peer Lord Smith of Clifton, who is 77, revealed his experience with HMRC, which he described as an ‘out-of-control computer juggernaut.’ 

He had promptly paid £992.62 he owed, but was pursued for the money for the next four weeks, threatened with debt collectors and faced charges for late payment.

Lord Smith said: ‘HMRC has no control over its computer system, which dementedly sends out demands for weeks on end.

‘This was to someone classified in the official jargon as a “frail, old pensioner” who had always been assiduous in paying his tax well before the deadline.’

Earlier this month it emerged that the independent tax watchdog had found in favour of nine in ten people whose case it investigated.

Over the 12 months to March 31, the Tax Adjudicator resolved 2,311 complaints. Of these, 2,073 went in favour, or partly in favour, of the taxpayer. Nearly £4million of tax was written off.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘There is no question of those who genuinely cannot pay being affected – the safety of vulnerable customers is a priority and the Government is proposing robust safeguards.’

The money will only be taken if they would have at least £5,000 left after it has been removed.
