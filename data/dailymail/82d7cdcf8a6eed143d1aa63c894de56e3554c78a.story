Millions of workers are losing out on their pension savings when they move jobs due to complexities in the current system, the Government warned today.

Pensions Minister Steve Webb outlined plans to protect the pensions of people who frequently change jobs and help them grow one 'big fat pension pot'.

One proposal is to abolish short service refunds for defined contribution occupational schemes, which allow people who switch jobs to get their contributions back, leaving them without the pension.

Confusing: Millions are losing out on their pension savings when they move jobs due to complexities in the current system, the Government warned today

The Government wants to strip out red tape that makes it hard for workers to transfer their pensions throughout their careers into one pension.

Mr Webb said he wanted to make it as easy as possible for people to 'grow big fat pension pots'.

He said: 'I am concerned that people are at risk of losing their small pension pots as they move from job to job.

'I
do not want to see people who are doing the right thing by saving, 
ending up with very little for their retirement because the system is 
too complicated.

'I want to make it as easy as possible for people to grow big fat pension pots.'

The
Government expects that a highly mobile jobs market and the 
introduction of automatic enrolment will lead to around 4.7million 
additional small pension pots in its pensions system by 2050.

The average employee works for 11 different employers over the span of his career.

Options
under consultation include encouraging transfers to an automatic system
where pension pots could either be consolidated in one or more 
'aggregator' schemes or move with people from job to job.

Plans to abolish short service refunds will form part of the next Pensions Bill.

Darren Philp, director of policy at 
the National Association of Pension Funds, said the Government was 
making a 'good start' by looking at the issue.

He
said: 'The current rules and regulations make transfers too 
bureaucratic and difficult for employees and pension schemes to 
navigate.

'Workers changing their job often find it difficult to transfer their pension pot when they move to a new company.

'Auto-enrolment will bring millions more workers into pensions saving.

'But
without action to make it easier for workers to transfer their pension 
pot when they move job, much of this new saving will end up stranded in 
small pots.

'This will 
be a bad outcome for employees, employers and the pensions industry as 
these small pots are expensive to administer, and will drive up costs 
and charges in the long run.'

He
said some of the suggestions made would require expensive 
administrative and legal changes, adding: 'The pensions world needs to 
work together to develop a viable and simpler solution.'
