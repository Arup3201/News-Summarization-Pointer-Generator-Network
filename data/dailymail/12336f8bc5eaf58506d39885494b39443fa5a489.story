Primary school pupils hid under their desks while older students huddled in a prayer hall when a knife-wielding intruder burst into an Islamic school, sending the campus into lockdown.

A man is alleged to have entered Al Faisal college in Minto, southwest Sydney, at about 2.10pm on Thursday and asked if it was a Muslim school before pulling out a knife and threatening a teacher and students 

A mother who did not wish to be named said she was greeted by a swarm of police when she arrived to pick up her children.

'I am still pretty much in shock,' she said.  

Mariam Veiszadah, spokesperson for Islamophobia Register Australia, said she had spoken to two parents from the school and a community leader who were in contact with the head of the school.

They had reported a man running onto school grounds, asking if it was a 'Muslim school' and then pulling out a knife and threatening a teacher and students, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Ms Veiszadah said she was told that the man ran into an office and threatened a female staff member after not being able to get into the classroom because the doors were locked.

'We are very shocked and saddened to hear about this incident,' she said.

'Distressed parents of affected students arrived at the school earlier today and found it surrounded by police officers and the SWAT team.'

The man was last seen on Kitson Road.

Macquarie Fields police officers searched the area without success but have released a description of a man who may be able to assist with inquiries.  

He has been described as being of Pacific Islander appearance, 20 to 25 years old and obese. He was wearing brown-khaki pants and a green shirt.

No one was injured during the incident. Anyone with information is urged to contact police immediately.

This comes after a week of a surge in Islamic terrorism and fear within Australia as an 18-year-old male ISIS terrorist stabbed two police officers multiple times before one officer shot him dead in Melbourne. 

Al-Faisal College is an independent co-educational school for students from Kindergarten to Year 12 who are aged 4 to 18 years-old.
