Victory: Diane Holliday, who has won a six-year court battle for a share of Ramadan Guney's estate

The former lover of a millionaire businessman has inherited Britain's largest cemetery after she spent six years locked in a vicious court battle with his children.

Diane Holliday, 50, is now the owner of Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey, after the High Court ruled she is entitled to a share of Ramadan Guney's fortune, which she claims is worth £28million.

She said that, because she was in a relationship with the rich Turkish Cypriot for eight years and had a son with him, she is entitled to 'reasonable provision' from his estate. But after he died aged 74 in 2006 his six grown children were adamant that she did not deserve a penny of his wealth.

The ensuing court dispute with Miss Holliday - who once claimed to have given birth to the lovechild of Dodi Fayed - grew increasingly bitter.

At one point one of Mr Guney's sons was even charged with taking out a hit on Miss Holliday - though he was later cleared at the Old Bailey.

The family insisted Mr Guney could not be the father of Miss Holliday's 12-year-old son as he had had a vasectomy 30 years before the boy's birth, but it was never proved that the child was not his.

And in 2008 the siblings said they believed that the cemetery owner had been murdered and decided to have his body exhumed.

Now, the Daily Telegraph reports, the High Court has ruled Miss Holliday should receive £60,000 a year for her and her son Houssein. The cemetery was said to be worth between £700,000 and £1.2million and could bring in more if Miss Holliday runs it as a business.

Judge Lindsey Kushner QC said in a written judgment that the Guney children's behaviour during the case had been 'despicable'.

In
1998 Ms Holliday, who was once labelled a 'gold-digger' during another 
court case, claimed Dodi Fayed was the father of her daughter - a year 
after he was killed in a car crash alongside Princess Diana.

Mohammed Fayed always maintained his son never  had a baby with Miss Holliday, and proof of the child's paternity has never been made public.

She said she had DNA test results that proved who the father was, but that these had been stolen from her car when she was attacked by a knifeman at a service station. Miss Holliday was arrested on suspicion of wasting police time, but was later cleared of faking the assault.

Paternity claim: Miss Holliday said Dodi Fayed fathered her daughter shortly before his death

It is understood she met Mr Guney at Dodi Fayed's funeral, which was held at the burial ground she now owns.

He died of an apparent heart attack in November 2006, in Northern Cyprus. His children's lawyer said in an earlier hearing that Mr Guney had had a number of girlfriends in his home country and died in the arms of one of them.

Miss Holliday won the right to make an inheritance bid at the Court of Appeal in 2010, after settling a crucial dispute over where Mr Guney was had been domiciled.

A judge dismissed the Guneys' claim that, since their father had been living in Northern Cyprus when he died, English courts had no power to award anything to the widow.

Judge Kushner handed Miss Holliday a crucial victory when she 
ruled that Mr Guney’s emotional attachment to the cemetery, which he 
bought in 1985, his choice of burial place and his love for their son, 
meant he had made England his home.

As well as Brookwood Cemetery, she won part proceeds from the sale of another property and will keep the home she shared with Mr Guney.

It will be decided in July whether his children will be allowed to appeal the High court's latest decision. They have already been awarded 130 properties in Cyprus, in addition to other assets.

The most recent ruling signals that there may be an end in sight to an incredibly long and expensive legal battle. One of Mr Guney's daughters, Gulon, said that by March 2010 she and her siblings had already spent about £500,000 in legal costs.
