A mother and her five-month-old son were kicked off a flight following an argument with a crew member - even though she complied with her demands.

Nicki Gazlay was on a connecting Frontier Airlines flight from Denver to Memphis on Wednesday when she was told to remove the youngster from an Ergo Baby carrier.

She explained to the flight attendant she didn't have to do it on the previous flight, but agreed anyway and placed the youngster on her lap.

Row: Nicki Gazlay was on a Frontier Airlines flight from Denver to Memphis when she was told to remove the youngster from an Ergo Baby carrier. She complied with the request but was still thrown off the flight

However, during the row, she told the crew member: 'Of course I am going to comply, I'm going to do whatever you say because you are the Queen of this airplane.'

She replied by saying: 'You're off'. 

Gazlay was then forced to buy another ticket for a different flight on another airline.   

She told WMC Action News: 'No one said a thing to me and that's the same airlines.' 

A number of people have criticized the airline and Gazlay has now written and official letter of complaint to the company.

Reaction: Nicki (pictured here with her child in the Ergo Baby Carrier) told the crew member she hadn't had to do the same on the previous flight

One person posted on Facebook saying the company should be 'ashamed' of their actions. 

The airline responded by saying: 'Thank you for your concern. We require all passengers to comply with FAA safety regulations and crew member instructions.'

Frontier Airlines are said to be investigating what happened.

They insist Ergo carriers are not approved for take-off or landing by the Federal Aviation Authority. 

The company suggests buying an extra ticket and bringing a car seat to get around it. 

Despite Gazlay's claims she was unfairly told to leave, other passengers said she became argumentative and started shouting.

One person who said she was sitting a couple of rows from Gazlay wrote on Facebook: While I believe that she has a valid point about the airlines being more uniform and upfront of what the rules/regulations are in this situation, she was far from cooperative in her encounter with the flight attendant. 

'The flight attendant asked her nicely several times after boarding to remove the baby from the carrier for takeoff and landing, but the young lady chose to ignore her requests. 

'Instead of just complying on the last request, she became argumentative and combative about why she didn't feel it was necessary since she was not asked to comply on her previous flight'.
