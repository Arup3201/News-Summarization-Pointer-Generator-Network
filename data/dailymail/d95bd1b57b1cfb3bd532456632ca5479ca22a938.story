Katarina Johnson-Thompson has been left 'devastated' after she was forced to pull out of the Commonwealth Games with a left foot injury.

The 21-year-old is ranked No1 in the world and was the favourite to win gold for England in the heptathlon, but has withdrawn after suffering a 'stress reaction' in her take-off foot for the long jump.

Johnson-Thompson still hopes to represent Great Britain at the European Championships in Zurich next month, where she has been selected to take part in the long jump, but said she did not dare risk 'long-term damage' by competing in Glasgow next week.

Ruled out: Katarina Johnson-Thompson will miss the Commonwealth Games after suffering a foot injury

She added: 'I’m absolutely devastated that I’m not going to be able to compete. I was so looking forward to competing in another home Games and this time as one of the favourites, so this is a real blow.

'Becoming World No1 in heptathlon had really given me the confidence going in to the Games that I could post a big score and hopefully come away with that gold medal, but sadly it’s just not meant to be.

'All the advice is telling me that I risk long-term damage if I compete in a heptathlon in just over a week’s time and I have to take that advice for the sake of my career.'

Neil Black, the performance director for British Athletics, said: 'Obviously we’ re really disappointed for Katarina as the Commonwealth Games was a big target for her this year, but the key thing is ensuring we don’t risk her long term career.

'We’re confident that with treatment and careful management she will still be in a position to compete in the long jump at the European Championships in Zurich next month, but a heptathlon starting next week could result in long term damage.'
