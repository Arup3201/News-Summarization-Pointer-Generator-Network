School truants are being hauled out of bed by police and escorted to classes in a patrol car.

Officers are clamping down on truants by calling at the homes of any pupils who fail to turn up to school without a reason.

If they are still in bed, police get the parents to wake them up before driving them to lessons.

The crackdown is the first of its kind and was launched last week in Amesbury, Wiltshire.

Inspector Christian Lange, the town’s police chief, said it is already producing results.

He said: 'So far, one early morning visit from the police has been enough.

'It’s not good for the parents when their neighbours see us knocking on their doors and taking their kids off to school.'

Each morning, police officers are provided with a list of children who have failed to turn up at school without a reasonable explanation.

Insp Lange said: 'Of course, if they are off sick or there is a good reason then we don’t intervene.

'If they are still in bed, we get their parents to wake them up, we put them in the car and deliver them straight to school.'

Officers are accompanied by an education welfare officer and are working closely in partnership with Wiltshire Council and local schools.

It is hoped the crackdown will help reduce antisocial behaviour in the town and ensure that children are getting their education.

Insp Lange said: 'The correct place for a child of that age to be is in school.

'If they are not in school they are more likely to get into trouble - it’s not good for anyone to be hanging around, doing nothing all day.

'Truancy is a recurring problem for a small number of children. They are missing out on their education, and if us waking them up and taking them to school is what is needed, then that is what we will do.

'So far we have been very pleased with the results, it is early days but we are taking truancy very seriously.

'It is a real example of a partnership working and getting things done.'

Parents have a legal responsibility to ensure their children attend school until they are 16.

From next year the school leaving age is due to rise to 17, and to 18 in 2015.

Fixed penalty notices and fines can be issued if parents fail to make sure their children go to school along with parenting contracts and parenting orders designed to enforce attendance.
