Harry Redknapp will be reunited with Jermain Defoe in January with the striker set to make a permanent switch from FC Toronto.

Defoe, who has scored 19 times for England in 55 appearances, came close to joining Rangers in the summer as his MLS switch went sour.

The 32-year-old was persuaded to move to Canada from Tottenham in January by Toronto's then-manager Ryan Nelsen, a former team-mate of Defoe's at Spurs.

But Defoe has been unsettled at the club since Nelsen was sacked in August and Sportsmail understands he will make the move back to England in January.

The London Evening Standard report that Defoe will sign a three-year contract at Loftus Road worth around £90,000-a-week.

Redknapp gave Defoe his West Ham debut in 1999, signed him for Portsmouth in 2008, and again for Spurs a year later.

Speaking after a deal fell through to sign Defoe on transfer deadline day in August, the QPR manager admitted: 'We tried all day with Jermain.

'He was keen to come. We agreed a deal with Toronto but they wouldn’t release him.

'There is every chance he will come in January. Almost certainly, I think we will go back in for him.'

Redknapp will look to partner Defoe with Charlie Austin, who has scored five times for QPR in the Premier League this season.
