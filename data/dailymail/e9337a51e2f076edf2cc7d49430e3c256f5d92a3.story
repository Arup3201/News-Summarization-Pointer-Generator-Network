ABC Family has canceled a controversial new pilot called Alice in Arabia after its leaked script sparked intense backlash for being racist.

Written by a former U.S. Army translator Brooke Eikmeier, the teen drama centers around an American girl 'kidnapped' by her Saudi Arabian grandfather, who happens to have the same name as an infamous member of Al Qaeda.

After a promotional description for the pilot was criticized, Eikmeier defended herself claiming the actual show was a sensitive and balanced portrayal of Saudi Arabian culture.

However, when the episode's draft script
 was leaked, revealing that the series was as racist as first thought, 
the fury erupted, and ABC Family moved to cancel it.

'The current conversation surrounding our pilot was not what we had envisioned and is certainly not conducive to the creative process, so we've decided not to move forward with this project,' ABC Family said in a statement.

As well as the online onslaught, the network was contacted by Muslim advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations who requested a meeting with community leaders.

Reference: One of the most offensive parts is the name chosen for her grandfather, Abu Hamza. In reality, Abu Hamza is an Islamic extremist cleric, pictured, who is facing charges including planning to open a jihadist training camp in the U.S.

'We are concerned that, given media references to the main character "surviving life behind the veil," the pilot and any resulting series may engage in stereotyping that can lead to things like bullying of Muslim students,' executive director Hussam Ayloush said Wednesday.

The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee also expressed concern about the show 'promoting bigotry and stereotyping of millions of Arabs and Arab-Americans, and billions of Muslims around the world,' according to Buzzfeed.

According to Deadline Hollywood, Eikmeier wrote the script while serving as cryptologic linguist in the Arabic language to the U.S. Army stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado, where she supported NSA missions in the Middle East.

Alice is a rebellious American teen who goes to visit her grandfather in Saudi Arabia amid a family emergency but he then hides her passport so she can't go home.

She watches Project Runway and sneaks out to parties while Muslim women who wear veils are portrayed as 'completely formless, anonymous.'

One of the most offensive parts however, is the name chosen for her grandfather, Abu Hamza.

In reality, Abu Hamza is an Islamic extremist cleric who is facing charges including planning to open a jihadist training camp in the U.S.

The hashtag #AliceInArabia became a trending Twitter topic last week after ABC Family released the synopsis.
