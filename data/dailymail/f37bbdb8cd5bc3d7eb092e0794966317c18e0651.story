Investigators are searching an area near Lynchburg, Virginia, for the remains of two young sisters from Maryland who were abducted in 1975, police said on Tuesday.

Police are looking for the remains of Katherine Lyon, ten, and 12-year-old Sheila Lyon, according to Captain Paul Starks, spokesman for the Montgomery County police department in Maryland.

The girls went missing on March 25, 1975, after walking to get some pizza at the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in Maryland and to look at the Easter decorations.

The girls walked just half a mile from their home to the mall with four dollars between them. They were seen walking home to meet their 4pm curfew but never made it. Police were alerted to the missing girls at 7pm.  

The Montgomery department has had investigators in Bedford County, Virginia, since last week. 

The Bedford County Sheriff's Office confirmed that officers were assisting 'with a homicide investigation'. Cold case investigators were also on the scene. 

'Recent developments in the investigation have led law enforcement to the Taylor Mountain area of Bedford County,' the Bedford County Sheriff's Office said.

The parents of the missing Lyon sisters still live in the same neighborhood and have asked for privacy, NBC reported. Their father was a well-known radio presenter in the area and their elder brother Jay became a police officer after his sisters' disappearance. 

In February, police said they had identified a convicted child sex offender in a Delaware prison as a person of interest in the case.

Lloyd Lee Welch, 57, also known as Michael Welch, was at the mall the day the girls vanished and was seen paying attention to them.

Welch, whom police describe as a former ride operator for a carnival company and a drifter who traveled the U.S. and often stayed in homeless shelters between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s. 

He has convictions in multiple states for raping young girls in several states and has been locked up in Delaware for more than 15 years. 

Starks said Welch's family once owned the property that is being searched in Bedford County, according to NBC. 

'This is just part of us continuing to stay on this case,' Starks said, 'and an attempt to determine what happened and who is responsible.' 

No remains have been found so far.

According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Katherine Lyon was last seen wearing a baby beads necklace with orange beads and 'KATE' in black letters on white beads and dirty beige brushed suede wallaby type Jumping Jack shoes with dirty beige shoelaces. 

Sheila Lyon was last seen wearing farsighted gold wire rimmed glasses, low cut GallenKamp sneakers, size 6.5 or 7.5, with dirty white shoestrings, and knee socks. Katherine has a birthmark on the inside of her upper thigh.

The organization also created age-progressed photographs of the sisters. Sheila Lyon would now be 52 and Katherine Lyon would be 50 years old.

The young sisters were last seen at this mall in Maryland after they went to buy pizza and look at the Easter decorations 

Search parties came out in force following the girls' disappearance in 1975 but no trace of the two Lyon sisters were ever found
