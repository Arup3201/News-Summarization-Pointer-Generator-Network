Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers believes former Southampton trio Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert will all settle in quickly at the club.

Rodgers cites the similarities in playing styles between the Premier League runners-up and the south coast outfit as to why his three summer signings will find life at Anfield a smoother transition than normally expected with a new arrival.

The Liverpool boss spent a combined £49million to bring the trio to Merseyside and says Southampton's offensive and aggressive style of play should mean they adapt quicker to his methods at the club.

'I think the advantage of taking them is that they understand how we work,' he told Goal.com.

'All the players we have brought in were done so because of their profile. Southampton played in a really offensive, aggressive way and the players that have come in will adapt that little bit quicker to that.

'There are obviously pressures. If you're playing for Liverpool, there's a different adaptation altogether, but in terms of the football style, that will make it easier.

'I think if you have three players coming in from the same club, of course it always helps on that first day walking into the changing room.

'Ultimately they'll gain respect because they're good players, and that's why they're at Liverpool. Hopefully they can show that over their career here.'
