Josie Connors leaving Luton Crown Court yesterday. A court heard the traveller family used 'vulnerable' men as virtual 'slaves'

A traveller family used ‘vulnerable’ men as virtual ‘slaves’ and kept them in ‘concentration camp’ conditions, a court heard yesterday.

Dozens of homeless people and drink or drug addicts were allegedly approached by the Connors family to do lucrative block paving work or collect scrap metal from homeowners.

But after agreeing to go with them it is claimed they were made to work up to 19 hours a day, six days a week, lived in appalling conditions and were often left starving.

Promised wages never materialised, the court was told.

Many of the workers were too scared to escape because of the fear of ‘physical violence and the threat of such violence’.

The
alleged victims said their heads were shaved and they were unable to 
shower for months at a time.

Clothes went unwashed and were thrown away 
when they began to fall apart.

One described the site where they lived as being like ‘a concentration camp’.

Some slept in sheds and even a converted horsebox.

Frances
Oldham, QC, prosecuting, said: ‘The case is about control and 
exploitation. The victims, and I deliberately call them that, were 
exploited because they were among the most vulnerable in society.

‘They were controlled in such a way 
that in many cases they could not see the extent of the control. They 
became conditioned so that these defendants could earn an awful lot of 
money.’

She added: ‘A number
of words may spring to mind to describe what was happening. They may 
not, in the strict sense, have been slaves but they were not free men.’

Irish-born
Tommy Connors snr, 52, his children Johnny, 28, Tommy, 26, James, 24, 
Patrick, 20, daughter Josie, 30, and her husband James John Connors, 34,
are accused of 20 charges in total relating to eight workers.

These include conspiracy to hold a 
person in servitude, conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or
compulsory labour, actual bodily harm and battery.

Luton
Crown Court heard the alleged mistreatment came to light when one 
worker escaped and contacted police.

Officers raided Greenacres Caravan 
Park near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire – where six of the defendants
live – on September 11 last year. Johnny Connors lives in St Albans, 
Hertfordshire.

Thirteen men were taken away from the caravan park. None can be named for legal reasons.

One,
the jury heard, was living in Brighton on benefits in the mid-1990s 
when Tommy snr offered him ‘£50 a day in cash and a roof over his head’.

The following day he began knocking on doors asking homeowners if they 
wanted block paving or tarmacking work.

Mrs Oldham said that over the years Tommy
snr, known as ‘Pa’, had attacked him more than a dozen times.

Usually 
he was punched but he had also been hit with a broom handle and 
scratched so deeply that blood was drawn.

Another worker later claimed he saw the man being ‘used like a human punch bag’.

One of the workers told police he regarded the site as 'like a concentration camp', the court was told.

The alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was living on benefits when he was recruited by Tommy Connors Snr and two of his sons, jurors heard.

The Connors offered him a job, £50 in cash and a roof over his head and took him to a site in Burgess Hill, West Sussex, where Tommy Connors Snr was living, it is alleged.

The following day, the man is said to have been set to work, knocking on doors and asking for block paving or tarmac work.

Ms Oldham said: 'At first he had been treated OK and given pocket money to buy cigarettes, biscuits and crisps.

'After a while, the travellers' treatment of [him] changed. Tommy Snr would hit him in the face for no reason when in a temper.'

As time went on, Tommy Connors Snr's children began to treat him 'worse and worse', she added.

Some days he was given 'no food at all', or just biscuits and crisps to snack on, the court heard.

Nor were labourers allowed to leave work to get something to eat, it was alleged.

It is also claimed that the workers were 'conditioned' to do what the Connors wanted.

For the past five years the alleged victim, who is in his fifties, lived at the Leighton Buzzard site. The court heard he had lived in a shed since 2009 where the bedding was changed about every four months.

Workers used to be taken for showers on Fridays, ready for knocking on doors over the weekends, Mrs Oldham said. But the intervals eventually stretched out to months. The only other way to wash was using a sink.

After the police raid the victim told officers he had received only £80 cash in 15 years. Sometimes only one meal was given at night, he claimed, ‘and only then if they were not back too late’.

The court heard he had been too ‘frightened’ to leave the camp and didn’t know where to go.

One worker claimed he had suffered ‘seven years of abuse, starvation and torture’. He said: ‘There was no respect. They treated me like a slave. And that’s putting it mildly.’

The court was told another worker said he had seen ‘hundreds’ of people being used by the family over the years. He added that he believed workers’ heads were shaved because it would allow them to be spotted in a crowd if they tried to escape.

The man described being given ‘chip shop food’ and that he  had lost a lot of weight and his teeth were falling out. Mrs Oldham said that at time he would be offered the leftovers of a kebab by two of the brothers, adding: ‘At other times they were given food that was so old flies were crawling over it.’

The jury was shown photos of the Connors’ spotless accommodation at the site, with new fitted kitchens, comfortable sofas, flat-screen TVs, expensive china and Waterford crystal jugs. Tommy snr had a jukebox and a giant bottle of Taittinger champagne in his chalet-style home and £4,000 in cash was found in a cooking pot on the stove.

The case continues.
