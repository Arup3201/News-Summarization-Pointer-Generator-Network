Arsene Wenger has fuelled doubt over Wojciech Szczesny’s future after providing a bizarre response to questions regarding the goalkeeper’s omission on Sunday.

Sportsmail understands the Polish goalkeeper arrived at the Emirates Stadium expecting to start in the 3-0 win over Stoke, despite being reprimanded for smoking in the showers following the New Year’s Day defeat at Southampton.

However, the goalkeeper found that he had been dropped and replaced with David Ospina, a decision that is said to have stunned and bewildered the 24-year-old.

And when questioned about Szczesny’s reaction to the news he had been axed, Wenger provided a confusing answer.

After a long pause, Wenger said: ‘I don’t know, but how can you take a decision? You know how you can take a decision.’

And then, when asked about why he dropped Szczesny, Wenger added: ‘Look, I don’t want to talk too much about that because the more I talk, the less I inform you. Was the smoking incident the reason? No. Honestly, no.’

Nevertheless, Szczesny’s future at the club seems more uncertain than ever.

Sportsmail revealed two weeks ago that Wenger had instructed his scouts to identify a new No 1 ahead of the summer transfer window due to Szczesny’s indifferent performances.

And the keeper’s smoking antics at St Mary’s merely reinforced Wenger’s view that he needs a new shot-stopper in place for next season.

Following his clean sheet in the FA Cup win over Hull last week, Ospina was handed his first Premier League start on Sunday. And after a second consecutive clean sheet, Szczesny will find it difficult to regain his place against Manchester City next weekend.

‘Will Ospina keep his place? I don’t know, I haven’t made a decision yet,’ insisted Wenger. ‘I made a decision for today’s game. Szczesny is our No 1, he is competing with Ospina and (Emiliano) Martinez and that’s our job, we have to accept that.’

Meanwhile, Mathieu Debuchy is facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines after dislocating a shoulder following a collision with Marko Arnautovic.

The France international, who has only recently returned from a long-term lay-off due to an ankle injury, needed lengthy treatment after being pushed towards the advertising hoardings by the Stoke forward in the 12th minute.

Debuchy had an X-ray but will see a specialist today to establish how long he will be unavailable, though he will definitely miss the clash against Manuel Pellegrini’s men.

With Kieran Gibbs still suffering with an ankle problem and Calum Chambers missing Sunday's clash through illness, Debuchy’s injury has highlighted Arsenal’s need to sign another defender this month.

Wenger said: ‘It doesn’t change my plans for the market because I was in the market anyway.’
