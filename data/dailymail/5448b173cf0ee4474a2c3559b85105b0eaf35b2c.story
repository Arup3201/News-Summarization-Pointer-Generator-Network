An autistic man trapped in a world of silence who can only speak a few words has stunned his family by singing, and has now released an album.

Kyle Coleman, 27, was diagnosed with 'classic autism' aged three, but soon retreated into a world of his own, stopped speaking, and to this day has never uttered a full sentence.

Kyle was almost completely non-verbal until 2009 when his mother took him to a musical therapy session and he started singing along to his favourite songs in pitch-perfect harmony.

Kyle Coleman, 27, has released an album of original songs despite being a non-verbal autistic who has never uttered a full sentence and has been virtually mute for his entire adult life

Kyle was diagnosed with autism aged three, and eventually stopped speaking. However he showed a natural affinity with music, and first sung aged six (pictured) but suddenly stopped

Kyle, of Gwithian, Cornwall, has now spent hours in a recording studio and is releasing an album of original material.

Caroline said: 'Singing is his turn to be heard. He will feel a song rather than think it. Kyle is so much calmer and more at peace now.

'About three years ago, on a scale of ten, his anxiety level was around nine - I would say it's about three now.

'It's opened a dialogue that makes Kyle and I more connected. He used to be very distant - autism can create a fortress around a person.

Kyle's gift for singing was unlocked in 2009 when he started music therapy and began singing along to his favourite songs

'But he pays attention when he is singing. He sleeps well, his tolerance levels are much better, and he's been able to make friends for the first time.

'It is kind of awe inspiring. Song has unlocked this innate, built-in gift that he had. It has taken Kyle to another level.

'What is the most breath taking thing is that he can put his own stamp on songs. He is extraordinary.'

Kyle showed an early affinity with music, and first sang aged six or seven with a clumsy rendition of 'Walking in the Air' from the Christmas classic The Snowman.

Caroline's ex-husband, who died in a motorbike accident, used to be a musician and she credits Kyle's musical ability to him.

But suddenly Kyle stopped singing. After years of silence mother-of-three Caroline took him to Cornwall Music Therapy Trust in Redruth where Kyle's talent was finally unlocked.

Caroline recalls how he came home, ran upstairs, got his favourite CDs and started singing along while playing the tune on his keyboard.

Encouraged by his therapist, Caroline took Kyle along to a local recording studio where he produced an album of cover version of his favourite Inide songs which was released in 2012.

His new album, Beyond the Syntax - referring to the difficulty autistic people have with ordering words - made its debut to coincide with World Autism Awareness Day on April 2.

It is a collection of 12 original songs - including Standing On Solid Ground - with most the the lyrics penned by his mother, who used to sing in her youth.

Kyle released his first album in 2012 featuring cover versions of Indie songs, but has now released an album of original tracks which were penned by mother Caroline who also used to sing in her youth

Mother-of-three Caroline says music has provided Kyle with a way to communicate and make friends. She says he is now much less anxious and that singing has brought them together

To coincide with the record's release, Kyle has also starred in his own music video, with some shots filmed in the busy high street near his home, a nerve-wracking ordeal for him which Caroline would have been unthinkable even a few months ago.

The LP is a collaboration between Kyle, Caroline and recording studio owner John, 42, a guitarist and producer based in Plymouth, Devon.

John, who sets the lyrics to music, said: 'It was clear straight away that he was really good.'

To coincide with the release of his first single Kyle also starred in a music video, including some shots recorded in a city centre, which his mother said would have been unthinkable even a few months ago
