We may be baking in a heatwave but scientists have detected snow around a young solar system 175 light years from Earth.

American Astronomers have snapped the first ever direct image of a snow line - the point where liquids turn to ice - around an infant solar system.

The images show the region around the star where water, carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide and other gases freeze onto dust particles orbiting around the young star at its centre.

American Astronomers have snapped the first image of a snow line (pictured). They saw the carbon monoxide snow line (where the green meets the black inner ring) that had formed around star TW Hydrae. They believe it is similar to how our own Solar System would have appeared when it was just a few million years old

A snow line is the point where liquids turn to ice, in an infant solar system.

On Earth, snow lines form at high elevations where falling temperatures turn atmospheric moisture to snow.

The snow line region is believed to play an important role in the formation of planets.

The
frosting that covers the dust particles floating in it allows them to 
stick together, rather than obliterate each other should they collide.

ALMA
has given us the first real picture of a snow line around a young star,
which is extremely exciting because of what it tells us about the very 
early period in the history of our own Solar System, scientists said

The scientists used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimetre Array (ALMA) telescope in Chile to take the images.

They saw the carbon monoxide snow line that had formed around star TW Hydrae, which they believe is similar to how our own Solar System would have looked when it was just a few million years old.

An artist's concept of a snow line around star TW Hydrae is pictured and shows ice-covered dust grains in the inner disc (blue) and carbon monoxide ice covered grains in the outer disc (green). The transition from blue to green marks the snow line

Dr Chunhua Qi, an American researcher 
with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, co-led the 
international team whose results are published in Science Express.

He said: 'ALMA has given us the first real picture of a snow line around a young star, which is extremely exciting because of what it tells us about the very early period in the history of our own Solar System.'

'We can now see previously hidden details about the frozen outer reaches of another solar system, one that has much in common with our own when it was less than 10 million years old.'

On Earth, snow lines form at high elevations where falling temperatures turn atmospheric moisture to snow.

In much the same way, snow lines form around young stars in the distant, colder reaches of the disks from which solar systems form.

The transition from blue to green marks the carbon monoxide snow line on this artist's concept. The snow helps grains of dust to adhere to each other by providing a sticky coating, which is essential to the formation of planets and comets

Depending on the distance from the star, other more exotic molecules can freeze and turn to snow.

The snow line spotted around TW Hydrae formed on the boundary between warm and cool regions of space where the young star's heat energy is weakest.

The presence of dust insulates an area of the gas which allows it to form ice crystals.

However, further out from the disk of dust that will eventually go on to form planets, the gas heats up.

This 'cocoon' of hot gas had previously thwarted the scientist's efforts to observe the snow lines, which were only discernible from their 'spectral signatures', or the radiation reflected off the particles and into space.
