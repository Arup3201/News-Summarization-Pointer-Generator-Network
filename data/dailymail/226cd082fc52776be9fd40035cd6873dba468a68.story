Louis van Gaal hailed the first complete performance of his Manchester United reign after the 3-0 win against Hull City at Old Trafford on Saturday.

'This is the first match that we have dominated the game from the first minute until the last, in a way that I like,' he said.

Van Persie of United receives a hug from team-mate Rooney after scoring their third goal at Old Trafford

'We knew in advance that they come with five defenders and a full midfield. We trained to play the ball quick and we did it, but also we didn't give the ball way unnecessarily. That was an improvement from the Arsenal game last time.'

Robin van Persie will grab the headlines after ending his poor form by scoring United's third goal with a left-foot thumper.

A pleased van Gaal said: 'Every striker needs a goal when you haven't score for two or three matches. So I am very pleased and happy with him for his goal, but he can still play better.

'In the beginning of the game, he played No 10 and not No 9. When I was forced to put him in a striker's position because of the injury to Angel di Maria, he played better.

'I am pleased he scored and had an influence of the game.'

Van Persie himself admitted: 'I am glad I scored - I needed that.'

The only downside was a hamstring injury to Angel di Maria who asked to be replaced after 14 minutes and will miss the home game against Stoke on Tuesday while he is assessed.

Wayne Rooney, scorer of United's second goal on Saturday, was also hobbling at the end after hurting his calf and knee but the striker is keen to play in the next game.
