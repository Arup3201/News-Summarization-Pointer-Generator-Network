Targeted: Candace Bushnell has been hacked by the cyber-attacker 'Guccifer' who leaked details of her new novel online

Candace Bushnell has become the latest victim of the 'Guccifer' hacker after details of her new novel, apparently called 'Killing Monica', were posted online.

The Sex and the City writer was targeted last night when the first page of her book was posted and a series of frantic messages appeared on her Twitter account.

Ms Bushnell, 54, is the latest high profile figure to be hacked by the anonymous cyber-attacker, who has previously targeted George W. Bush Snr, Colin Powell and a former aide to Bill Clinton.

The hacker is said to have got into her personal computer, taken over her webpage and Twitter account and posted a link to documents showing her new book.

The Tweet said: 'Here you can read my last book 'killing monica' first 50 pages, enjoy'.

Then Guccifer uploaded emails from the author to her publisher showing distress at the fact her Twitter account had been hacked.

The frantic emails between the author and her publisher, in which Bushnell writes, 'Oh dear, this is terrible,' were tweeted in screenshot form as well.

The messages revealing the first 37,000 words of Bushnell’s next novel via screen grabs posted to Google Drive have since been removed from Bushnell's feed.

In an interview posted on The Smoking Gun, Bushnell said that her e-mail and Twitter accounts were broken into yesterday, and that she had no idea how they were breached.

She added that a simultaneous attempt was made to compromise her Facebook account, but that she received an alert that someone was attempting to access it from an IP address in Albuquerque, New Mexico that was not recognized by the social networking firm.

She told the site: 'Yesterday I woke up and I couldn’t get my e-mails', and added that she had to repeatedly change her password while tussling with the hacker for control of the account.

Under attack: Candace Bushnell's personal site was taken over by hacker 'Guccifer' who posted a link to page from her new novel

The hacker has previously targeted political heavyweights like former President George W. Bush and his former Secretary of State Colin Powell has a new victim but this time from the other side of the aisle.

A close confidante of both former 
President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has
been added as the latest victim of a hacker who goes by the name 
'Guccifer'.

Sidney 
Blumenthal's email was allegedly hacked sometime this week and Guccifer 
was able to obtain email correspondence between Blumenthal and Mrs 
Clinton.

It is unclear what
exactly the hacker was looking for or how many emails he was able to 
obtain, but the data in Mr Blumenthal's breached AOL account dates back 
to 2005.

Close connections: Sidney Blumenthal (right) was an aide to Bill Clinton when he was President, and now Blumenthal was the latest victim in a series of politically-targeted hacks

The other Clinton: The hacker may have been targeting emails Blumenthal exchanged with Hillary Clinton when she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to earlier this year

The timeline means that it is unlikely that any memos that Blumenthal sent to Clinton when he worked as a close advisor in the late 1990s and early 2000s were part of the hacked data.

Though Mr Clinton was out of the White House by 2000, he stayed in touch with the powerful couple up to present day.

Mr Blumenthal told The Smoking Gun that he only realized something was awry with his account when he could not log in Thursday morning.

Other targets: Former Secretary of State Colin Powell (left) had his Facebook account hacked and emails sent by former President George Bush's relatives (right) were also breached

To outside observers, Mr Blumenthal seems like an odd target because his theorettical political heyday occurred when Mr Clinton was in the White House. In that wake it appears the hacker was looking for information exchanged with Mrs Clinton while she was in the post of Secretary of State from 2009 to earlier this year.

That theory also fits the trend that the hacker's interest stem from a possible conspiracy theory or issue stemming to foreign relations.

Other targets have included Senator Lisa Murkowski, former United Nations ambassador John Negroponte and unidentified members of the famed Rockefeller family.

Republican General Powell had his Facebook page broken into and created several posts.

Offensive: One of the bizarre posts made by the hacker included this one which read: 'You will burn in hell, Bush!'

Bizarre: The hacker posted a series of rants on General Powell's page as well as a series of photos which are believed to have been taken from former President George W Bush's hacked email account

Apology: General Powell described the hacker's posts as 'stupid' and 'obscene' on his page yesterday

One post read: 'You will burn in hell, Bush!'

In another bizarre post, the hacker ranted: 'Kill the illuminati! Tomorrow’s world will be a world free of illuminati or will be no more!'

As well as the offensive posts, some of which insulted Powell himself, pictures were uploaded to Powell's Facebook page showing screen grabs of the hacker's previous access to email accounts of Mr Bush and his siblings Neil and Dorothy.
