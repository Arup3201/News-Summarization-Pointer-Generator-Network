Control of a Baltimore prison was effectively handed over to a group of gang member inmates who seduced and bribed the female guards.

Federal prosecutors say 13 female correctional officers, seven inmates and five others with gang ties have been charged with plotting to smuggle drugs, cellphones and other contraband into the Baltimore jail and other corrections facilities.

An indictment unsealed Tuesday said the ring also involved sex between inmates and guards that led to four of the officers becoming pregnant by Tavon White, leader of a jailhouse gang called the Black Guerrilla Family.

Under gang control: The Baltimore City Detention Center (pictured) was reportedly run by the gang-member inmates who seduced female prison guards who they felt had 'low self-esteem'

He is held at the Baltimore City Detention Center, awaiting trial on a charge of attempted murder.

'The inmates literally took over "the asylum," and the detention centers became safe havens for BGF,' FBI Special Agent in Charge Stephen Vogt said.

White, 36, allegedly fathered five 
children with the four female guards, who were identified as Jennifer 
Owens, 31, Katera Stevenson, 24, Chania Brooks, 27, and Tiffany Linder, 
27.

The request for search warrants to allow 
investigators to visit the homes of the female guards says that the 
prisoners, many of whom were connected to the Black Guerrilla Family 
gang, chose their targets strategically.

'The inmates literally took over ¿the asylum,¿ and the detention centers became safe havens for BGF,' FBI Special Agent in Charge Stephen Vogt said

The officers that they focused on were ones that they believed had 'low self-esteem and insecurities'.

The Washington Post reports that two of the officers in question got tattoos of White's name, one on one officer's neck and the second officer on her wrist.

The indictment claims the gang ran the scheme from inside the detention center and charges gang members and corrections officers with conspiracy, drug possession and distribution and money laundering.

A telephone call seeking comment from White's attorney was not immediately returned Tuesday.

The Washington Post reports that during a wiretapped cellphone call made by White in January, he told a friend: 'This is my jail. You understand that? I’m dead serious. I make every final call in this jail.'

The guards helped the gang leaders smuggle cell phones and drugs into the prison.

The arrangement was apparently profitable: one gang leader bought two luxury cars- a BMW and a Mercedes- with the profits from his contraband sales within the prison.

He then allowed some of the officers to drive the cars in return for their cooperation.

'Correctional officers were in bed with BGF inmates,' Maryland U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein said.

'We need to be able to rely on people within law enforcement — to make sure they are on our side.'
