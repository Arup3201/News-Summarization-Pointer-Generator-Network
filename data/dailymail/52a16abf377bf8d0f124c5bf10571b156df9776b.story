Register rage: William Golladay, 77, was arrested after attacking another shopper who had placed too many items in the express checkout line at a Florida Walmart on Saturday

A 77-year old-man was arrested after attacking another shopper who had placed too many items in the express checkout line at a Florida Walmart.

William Golladay is said to have suffered from 'register rage' after shopper John L. Malherbe placed more than 20 items on the checkout on Saturday.

He is alleged to have counted the items before shouting at his 65-year-old victim that he wasn't supposed to use the express line.

Malherbe, who was in a motorized scooter, began arguing with Golladay.

Golladay, from Punta Gorda, Florida, is alleged to have rammed his metal shopping trolley into the victim injuring his elbow.

Staff at the Walmart store escorted Golladay out of the store.

But he attempted to walk back inside the store and approach his victim with both fists raised.

Staff again escorted him from the store and he was arrested on a felony battery charge.

The store's surveillance video captured the entire incident.Â
