Darren Fletcher believes the 'fear factor' will return to Old Trafford this season under Louis van Gaal.

The Manchester United midfielder scored the winning penalty as Van Gaal's winning start to his reign continued against Inter Milan on Tuesday night.

After a goalless 90 minutes in Washington, United converted each of their five penalties, with Fletcher slotting home the decisive kick.

Last season was Manchester United's worst at home since the Premier League began.

And the Scotland international said: 'The fear factor will be back at Old Trafford next season, don’t worry about that.'

United lost seven Premier League games at home last season as they slumped to a seventh place finish.

Fletcher's team-mate Luke Shaw, meanwhile, insists he is not afraid of working hard to be ready for the new league season.

In a frank interview following United's penalty shoot-out win, the left-back conceded Van Gaal had every right to criticise him over his lack of fitness.

Van Gaal revealed at a press conference on Monday that he has had to devise a special training programme for Shaw, who turned up for pre-season out of shape after three weeks off.

'Obviously I have seen that, and it's something I totally agree with,' Shaw said when asked about Van Gaal's press conference comments.

'To play in this formation you have to be really fit. I am fit but I am not at the high level he demands.

'I have got to get fitter to get up and down (the wing). It's something I have got to work on.'

Van Gaal, meanwhile, praised his side after their shoot out victory.

'I am very pleased,' he said. 'I think we played by far the best match of our sequence of three.

'They only had one shot on our goal and that was given by the referee [a free-kick], but I think we also created six or seven chances, so then it is seven against one.

'I was very pleased with our ball possession; it was much better than the other matches. And I think also the positions were better covered.

'So I was tonight very pleased with the performance of my players, both in the first half and the second half.'
