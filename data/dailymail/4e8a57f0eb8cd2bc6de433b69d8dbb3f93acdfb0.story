The father who inadvertently ignited a controversy by posting a photograph of his daughter with a sign that said 'I pooped in the shower' has spoken out to defend his actions.

The doting father, whose identity MailOnline chose not to reveal in order to protect his child, said that while people have a right to pass judgement on him and his actions, his intentions were merely to connect with other parents and make light of the stinky situations they find themselves in.

He called the people who have attacked him 'bullies' and said that he was shocked at the outrage his image received, adding that 'if people actually have my daughter’s best interest at heart they will leave us alone.'

The picture - in which the girl's face is clearly visible - went viral on the Internet and sparked outrage with some calling the dad 'sick' and urging social services to investigate him.

Clearly unaware what is going on, she is smiling with the sign on a piece of string round her neck.

It reads: 'I pooped in the shower and daddy had to clean it up. I hereby sign this as permission to use in my yearbook senior year.'

At first, the father defended his decision to post the photograph on the message board in a humorous manner.

'Only to be fair, I will sign a piece of paper giving her full rights to do this to me when I'm old and decrepit,' he wrote.

But the negative comments continued, so he deleted his account.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, he said the whole incident was blown out of proportion.

'People have every right to pass judgment on me and disagree with my actions,' he said.

'I personally thought it was funny and wasn't looking for attention but 
merely trying to give parents that are able to laugh at these silly 
things a chance to.'

He said that he's seen several of these kinds of posts on Reddit before and they've never garnered this much attention.

'I wasn’t angry with my daughter I was making light of a messy situation,' he said.

The reaction was one of outrage and 
on Reddit ilikepix wrote: ‘You don't make a child tough and resilient by
having her parents, who are meant to be the two people in the world she
can trust absolutely, set out to embarrass her in the most public of 
settings.

‘That makes a child insecure, because it teaches her she can't trust the people closest to her.’

On another blog a commenter 
wrote: ‘The father is one sick piece of c***’ whilst another said:  
‘Someone needs to hang a sign on him for being a terrible father that 
exploits his poor toddler daughter.’

The father said he's been getting threatening emails, phone calls and messages for days, but he's ignoring them - which is how he tells his own daughter to deal with bullies.

'The outrage this has caused is terrible. To say that I've been threatened is an understatement,' he said.

was teaching her or some action with ill intent.'

While he had defended his tough love approach, he also regrets that the image reached so many thousands of people. He never intended for it to go viral.

'This doesn't make me a terrible father it makes me a man who made one poor choice. It makes me human,' he said.

His daughter, thankfully, has remained ignorant of the entire ordeal.

'My biggest fear is it actually is pushed into affecting my daughter who thank God has remained ignorant of this ordeal,' he said. 'If people actually have my daughter’s best interest at heart they will leave us alone.'

People have every right to pass judgment on me and disagree with my actions. I personally thought it was funny and wasn't looking for attention but merely trying to give parents that are able to laugh at these silly things a chance to. I've seen similar things online but I guess they just flew under the radar.  Being in the company of “shaming” parents is false because I wasn’t angry with my daughter I was making light of a messy situation.

As far as the negative comments, I've been treating them the same way I'm raising my daughter to treat anyone that would bully her I'm ignoring them. I don't judge them.

I've been flooded with support, been properly asked to use my daughters image on like minded blogs and I greatly appreciate that. Many people loved it and received exactly as intended.

I will admit it was poor judgment on my part to allow it to be seen to this magnitude. I don't raise my daughter on poor judgment but I like every other person in the world am capable of making one. This doesn't make me a terrible father it makes me a man who made one poor choice. It makes me human.

In her life I'm certain she'll meet bullies and people who are just plain mean. Many of them were in the original post talking flat out perverted and disgusting about my 3 year old. This is why I deleted it. I will always do everything in my power to prevent that but they're out there.

I've learned a few things from this and that's that not everyone has the same sense of humor and I'll just have to keep my photos to family, close friends and myself. People are far more easily offended then I actually thought. I would appreciate it if this didn't get any bigger. My biggest fear is it actually is pushed into affecting my daughter who thank God has remained ignorant of this ordeal. If people actually have my daughter’s best interest at heart they will leave us alone.

I don’t need the approval of people who automatically assume someone is a bad parent because of one instance of disagreement.

My daughter and my wife are my whole life. They are all I really need.
