For sale: A rare first edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece The Great Gatsby is expected to fetch more than £100,000 at auction

It may not be in the best condition but this rare first edition copy of Scott F. Fitzerald's masterpiece The Great Gatsby is still expected to fetch £100,000 at auction.

The much sought-after book has come to light just two weeks after the release of the blockbuster adaptation of the book starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan.

The 7ins by 5ins copy belonged to 
author and critic Malcolm Cowley and features more than 100 transcribed 
notes and comments made by Fitzgerald. Its dust jacket is torn and faded and the back cover is held in place by tape.

Despite its condition, experts expect
it to fetch £100,000 when it will go under the hammer along with a 
group of Fitzgerald's letters and an unpublished poem.

Although it is now regarded as one of the greatest American novels ever written, the book only sold 20,000 copies on its 1925 release, netting Fitzgerald a meagre $2,000. It only became a hit following Fitzgerald's death in 1940.

In stark contrast, this year's film version, directed by Baz Luhrmann, has brought in almost £100 million after opening on May 10.

The Great Gatsby tells the story of mysterious American millionaire Jay Gatsby, played by DiCaprio in the £105 million film, in the prosperous Roaring Twenties era.

The story is told by Nick Carroway (Tobey Maguire in the movie), a neighbour of Gatsby, and revolves around Gatsby's love for Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan).

It is noted for its accurate portrayal of the decadence and social upheaval of 1920s America.

A spokesman for auctioneers Sotheby's said: 'The book is now almost universally recognised as standing among the great achievements of 20th-century American literature with the tragic story of Jay Gatsby, and more broadly, the American dream, resonating with readers for generations.'

The auction will be held by Sotheby's in New York on June 11.
