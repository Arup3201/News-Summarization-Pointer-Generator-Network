Caught: Tarod Thornhill, 17 (pictured), has been identified as the gunman behind a shooting at a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania mall Saturday night. He was arrested early Sunday morning at his home

The gunman accused of injuring three in a shooting at a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania mall Saturday night has been captured and arrested by police.

Authorities were able to identify alleged shooter Tarod Thornhill, 17, comparing surveillance footage with a picture of the suspect posted to Instagram just hours before the incident at the Monroeville Mall.

It's believed that Thornhill went to the mall to target 20-year-old Davon Jones, who was critically injured, in addition to bystanders Thomas and Mary Singleton, 48 and 47.

Though he is a minor, Thornhill has been charged as an adult with three counts of aggravated assault, four counts of reckless endangerment, two weapons charges and one count each of attempted homicide and causing catastrophe.

He was taken into custody early Sunday morning around 3:15am at his home in Brackenridge. 

The shooting occurred on the ground floor of the Macy's store inside the Monroeville Mall.

According to the police affidavit, Thornhill confronted Jones in the Polo clothing line area of the Macy's around 7:30pm and the two got in a verbal confrontation.

Thomas and Mary Singleton were shopping in the same area with their son, age unknown, when they stepped between to the two arguing men to prevent a physical fight. 

That's when Thornhill pulled out a handgun and started firing 'indiscriminately'.

A chaotic scene ensued as security tried to evacuate the mall and shoppers ran for safety.

A huge police contingent swarmed the center and searched each store. The three victims were rushed to nearby Forbes Hospital where Mr Jones and Mr Singleton were last reported in critical condition. Ms Singleton was reported in serious condition. 

Thornhill initially fled the scene, but investigators were able to track him down several hours later using a picture posted to Instagram. In the image, posted four hours before the shooting, Thornhill was seen wearing the same outfit as the suspect according to surveillance footage. That outfit included a black hooded sweatshirt with white lettering inside a white box on the front, black pants, white belt, and black and gray Nike shoes with white laces. 

He is currently being held at Allegheny County Jail and is due back in court on February 18.

Pennsylvania native and ex-NFL quarterback Terrelle Pryor tweeted that he was at the Monroeville Mall, a short drive east of Pittsburgh.

'Damn was just in monroeville mall and just saw 2 ppl get shot,' he tweeted about 7.30pm.

'They are letting guns go in there.'

In late December, hundreds of teenagers gathered at the mall and several fights broke out. 

The fights caused local officials and mall administration to agree on a plan to increase security there.

Weapons are banned at the mall, whose code of conduct specifically prohibits 'Carrying or displaying weapons of any kind except those carried by certified law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties.'
