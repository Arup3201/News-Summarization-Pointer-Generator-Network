A student named Homecoming Queen at a Texas high school on Friday surprised one of her best friends by immediately passing the title on to her after other students had played a cruel trick on girl.

No sooner had Anahi Alvarez's name been read out the high school's football field, than it was announced that she was honoring another girl, her best friend Lillian Skinner.

Friends of Lillian, 17, describe her as a ‘sweet’ and ‘amazing girl’ who is always smiling and loves to spread a happiness.

But in the run up to the Homecoming Queen announcement, Lillian had been the victim of a cruel prank by some mean girls who had tried to convince the senior that she had been nominated for the title when she hadn't.

After hearing about the cruel stunt, Skinner’s friends Naomi Martinez and Anahi Alvarez, who were nominated for homecoming queen at Grand Prairie High School in Grand Prairie, Texas, came up with a plan of their own.

'We promised each other and we were like, "No matter what, no backing down. If one of us wins we’re giving Lillian the crown,'" Martinez told KTVT.

On Friday, when the homecoming court assembled on the football field and Alvarez was crowned queen, another announcement followed.

'Anahi is honoring a very hard working senior with her crown. We would like to announce Lillian Skinner, please step up and receive this honor,' read the announcer.

Skinner, who was at the event taking photographs for the school paper, said she was totally floored by her friends' kindness.

'I was like, "My name is not on the poll. How is it that possible?'" she said, adding that she shed 'tears of happiness.'

According to Alvarez, the right person ended up with the homecoming crown.

'For me, I want to say, and I always say, Lilly won. I just ran in her place, in her position,' she said. 'When they ask me, "Were you homecoming queen?" I say, "No, Lilly is homecoming queen.'"

Principal Lorimer Arendse, who was in on the plan to share the crown, said it was 'probably the greatest moment I've ever experienced as a principal.'
