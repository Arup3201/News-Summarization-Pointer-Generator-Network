When her son told her he was gay, she describes it as a moment which 'shattered her dreams for a moment'.

Little did Jane Clementi realise that less than a month later, her life would be shattered by the news her son threw himself off the George Washington Bridge after being subjected to homophobic bullying.

Tyler Clementi, 18, committed suicide on 22 September, 2010. Three days earlier, his Rutgers roommate Dharun Ravi, 19, allegedly used a webcam to watch Tyler kissing another man in their dorm room and streamed it live in an incident that shocked the nation.

As Ravi awaits trial in February, Tyler's parents have broken their silence for the first time over the death of the son they adored and the hopes they have for his legacy.

Speaking to People magazine, his mother Jane, 53, said: 'It wouldn't be fair to Tyler's memory to let this slide. Something good has to come out of this terrible situation.'

She said neither she or her husband Joe had an inkling their son was gay until they told him, and actually had suspicions about their other son James.

Grieving: Tyler told his friend about coming out to his parents, Joe and Molly Clementi, saying his mum had rejected him

When Tyler - a skilled violist - told
his mother about his sexuality and that he was 'tired of living a lie' 
just a few days before leaving for his freshman year at New Jersey's 
Rutger's University, she said she was stunned.

'We
talked for a while, hugged for a while, cried together. I told him how 
much I loved him and he told me how much he loved me.'

Internet chats and texts released in the criminal case paint a different picture, as Tyler had wrote to a friend about coming out: 'Mom has basically completely rejected me.'

But Mrs Clementi said this was not true.

'I told him I needed time. You have dreams for your children, and when someone tells you this, your dreams are kind of shattered for that moment.

'I was processing it, but cutting him out of my life was never a possibility.'

Sweeping changes: Rutgers University has announced it will allow men and women to share rooms to make the campus more inclusive for gay students

Ravi has pleaded not guilty to the 15
charges against him, which include four counts of bias intimidation, a 
hate crime. His lawyer insists he never bullied Tyler or was in any way 
biased towards him.

Mrs Clementi remembers the day Tyler moved into the dorm with Ravi, telling People: 'He wouldn't even look at Tyler'.

His dad Joe said: 'I didn't think anything of it at the time. In retrospect i wonder.'

According to court documents, Ravi had already discovered through the internet that his roommate was gay and posted on his Twitter account in August: 'Found out my roommate is gay,' and linked to a thread that Tyler is 
believed to have posted on a gay community chat room.

Then on September 19, according to Twitter archives stored by Google,
he tweeted again: 'Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went 
into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a 
dude. Yay.'

This was the night that is believed to have led Tyler to kill himself.

Accused: Dharun Ravi, left, and Molly Wei, have both left the university

Talented: Tyler Clementi was a gifted violinist. His death has served as a rallying point for anti-bullying and gay rights campaigners

Molly Wei, whose computer Ravi 
allegedly used, will avoid prosecution if she completes 300 hours of 
community service and testifies against Ravi in his trial.

The Clementis say they are not sure 
how they feel about her, telling People: 'I'm glad she agreed to help 
the prosecution. I still haven't heard an apology though.'

They are not seeking revenge for 
their son's death, as Mr Clementi says he does not believe a just 
outcome requires maximum penalties.

Mrs Clementi said: 'Remorse would be nice. It's hard to forgive someone who doesn't think he did anything wrong.'

Since his death, his parents have set
up a foundation in his name - thetylerclementifoundation.org - which 
offers grants to programmes that dealÂ  with gay teens, suicide 
prevention and bullying.

Mr Clementi told People: 'We don't want anybody to have an experience like this.'
