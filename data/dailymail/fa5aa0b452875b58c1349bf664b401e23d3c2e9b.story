An elderly California couple lost their home to a sudden mudslide on Friday and believed they'd lost their beloved dog, too, until the Dachshund miraculously appeared in the window of their inundated home.

Crews were working to clear tons of mud from a Camarillo Springs subdivision on Sunday after the massive debris flow slammed into a dozen homes.

Tinkerbell's owner was buried up to his waist and later rescued. Tinkerbell herself remained missing until Sunday.

Emotional reunion: 5-year-old Dachshund Tinkerbell was presumed dead after a devastating California mudslide on Friday. Here, she and her owner are reunited on Sunday

Everyone's safe: Officials say the mudslide was triggered when a storm drainage ditch became too full of debris to divert the water and mud. Only Tinkerbell's owners' home was a complete loss

That's when a neighbor spotted the 5-year-old pooch in a window.

'Cheers erupted this morning inside the Ventura County Fire Communications Center upon receiving the report,' Ventura County Fire Department posted on their Facebook page.

Crews pull Tinkerbell from the muddy wreckage and her owner was soon on his way to pick her up.

That owner, though not interested in discussing his profound relief to reporters, posed for a photo with Tinkerbell.

With such an emotional shot, no words were necessary -- this was deeply emotional reunion.

The storm that started in Northern California on Friday and caused the mudslide moved south is typical for November, the start to California's wet season.

The storm caused 11 residents in the Ventura County neighborhood to be evacuated. Residents spotted Tinkerbell in the window of her home while cleaning up the tons of mud over the weekend

However, the 2013 Spring fire had scorched the hillside in the Camarillo Springs neighborhood.

'Where a fire burns real hot it glazes the soil, that soil loses its ability to absorb the moisture from the rain,' Ventura County Fire Department Capt. Mike Lindberry explained to CBSLA.

All have since been given the okay to return to their homes except for Tinkerbell and her owners, whose house is a total loss.
