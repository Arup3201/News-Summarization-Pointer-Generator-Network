Police are investigating after a series of 'child exorcisms' are said to have taken place at dawn outside a south London leisure centre.

People living near the South Norwood Leisure Centre in Croydon have reported a string of incidents in the past month where groups of people surround a toddler chanting, 'Get the demon out!'

Witnesses also say the adults shout about 'releasing the spirit' during the 20-minute ceremonies, which take place between 4am and 6am.

The group of about eight people have allegedly been gathering outside the South Norwood Leisure Centre in Croydon and chanting about 'releasing the spirit' during the 20-minute ceremonies, between 4am and 6am

The 'exorcisms' are said to have taken place at dawn outside the South Norwood Leisure Centre, pictured, in Croydon 

It is claimed that the child is told to 'stand still' in the centre of a circle while the group chant and when they are finished, they drive off in their cars, putting the child in a car seat.

It is not yet known if the same child is present on each occasion or if they are different children.

The ceremonies have taken place several times in the past month, with the latest being held yesterday outside the leisure centre, when police attended.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police confirmed that officers had spoken the group on Thursday after being alerted to the suspected exorcisms by local residents.

He said the group were warned about how their actions could impact on the ‘wider community’, but that there were no allegations of criminal behaviour.

He said: 'We received a call about this issue earlier in the month, although no allegations of crime have been made.

'Officers have made local enquiries but have not identified any of the individuals involved at this time.

'We are continuing with our enquiries to try and establish the identify of the child allegedly involved to ensure that there is no risk to their welfare.'

Local Amy Davies, 34, who lives near the leisure centre, said: 'Whatever is going on it’s a bit weird.

'The child must be confused and it can’t be good for them to be in this situation.'

While another, who asked not to be named, said he had contacted the police after witnessing the incident on Wednesday and Thursday this week.

He said: 'The child is put in the circle as the adults start chanting about demons and spirits.

'I didn’t get too close as it’s all a bit odd, but I thought I should phone the police and let them know about it just in case this kid was in danger.'

Other residents are said to have contacted the police after being woken up by the chanting in the early hours of the morning.

One said: 'It’s not quiet chanting, it’s loud enough to wake me up and I'm at least 200 feet away from where they hold these things.'

A spokesman for Croydon Council said: 'When we became aware of this issue we quickly referred it to the police.

'We’ve also discussed the situation with local residents to gain as much information as possible.

'If anyone witnesses any further gatherings they should contact the police directly.'
