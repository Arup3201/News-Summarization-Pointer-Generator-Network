Manchester United's main aim: return to the summit of the Premier League. But for now, they take top spot with an unwanted record of nine players out injured.

Defender Paddy McNair's hamstring injury suffered in the 2-1 win over Everton on Sunday is United's fifth defensive casualty at present, joining Luke Shaw (knee), Jonny Evans (ankle/foot), Phil Jones (hamstring) and Chris Smalling (hip/thigh) on the sidelines.

Ander Herrera (fractured rib), Jesse Lingard (knee), Michael Carrick (ankle/foot) and Ashley Young (groin/pelvis) are also crocked for United, with Wayne Rooney still to serve two games of his suspension for the dismissal against West Ham.

United should have most of their first-team stars available by the end of this month, but manager Louis van Gaal must now let his men out of his grasp and hand them over to their international teams.

The likes of David de Gea, Marcos Rojo, Angel di Maria, Wayne Rooney, Daley Blind and Robin van Persie will be with their countries this week, and it won't be the international 'break' Van Gaal had in mind if one of his men comes back injured.

United sit two clear of Arsenal in the injury charts, with Arsene Wenger's men nursing seven casualties alongside Burnley, Everton, Newcastle and West Ham, according to The Physio Room.

Arsenal arguably have more influential first-team stars sidelined than United, with Mikel Arteta, Aaron Ramsey, Mathieu Debuchy, Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott all out.

It comes as no surprise title favourites Chelsea and Manchester City sit with just four and two injuries respectively. 

United return to action against West Brom on Monday, Octber 20, before hosting Chelsea six days later.
