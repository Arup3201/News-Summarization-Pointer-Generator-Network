Since his appointment last year he has been showered with lavish gifts from royalty, world leaders and luxury goods makers.

But in keeping with his famously frugal reputation Pope Francis has declined to keep the generous presents for himself and is to raffle them off for charity, according to reports.

The top prize is a Fiat Panda in papal white, with four runners up winning one of a selection of bikes including a tandem and a racing bike.

Sixth prize in the ten euro raffle, to be drawn 8th January, is a HD video camera, Italian newspaper Il Messaggero reported.

Also up for grabs are an Illy coffee machine and a Panama hat by luxury manufacturer Homero Ortega, alongside more mundane presents including watches, silver photo frames, pens, briefcases and shoes. 

More strangely gifted umbrellas, perfumes and shoes also form part of the booty.

Tickets can be bought by anyone in Vatican post offices and museums.

Pope Francis said that a Christian's faith can be measured by often they put their hand in their wallet to help others.He said it wasn't enough to go lukewarm to mass and lead a life without grave sin

Francis has often called for 'a church for the poor', telling his official alms giver Monsignor Krajewski that he 'wouldn't need a desk' but should be out on the streets finding the needy. 

Yesterday morning he said that a Christian's faith can be measured by often they put their hand in their wallet to help others. 

He said it wasn't enough to go lukewarm to mass and lead a life without grave sin. 

'True conversion is putting your hand in your pocket', he said.
