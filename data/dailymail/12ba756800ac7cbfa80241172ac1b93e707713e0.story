The family home of the man most associated with Sydney's famous Luna Park has been put up for sale. 

One of the most important figures in the history of the famous Sydney attraction, Ted Hopkins worked his way up to be park manager in 1957 after the death of original manager, David Atkins.

Now Hopkins' former Wollstonecraft home, not far from Luna Park, is on the market after being in the family for the past 75 years. 

Ted Hopkins' former Wollstonecraft home will go on the market for A$1.7 million

Hopkins' lived in his former home in Wollstonecraft for years when not working at Luna Park  

The cottage on 800 square metres at 15 Milner Crescent has been listed through Danny Grant of Ray White Lower North Shore with a hefty price tag of A$1.7 million.

After replacing Atkins as park manager Hopkins continued in the role until 1969, when Leon Fink took over.

Hopkins chose the house to be close to his work and his family

Luna Park opened on 4 October, 1935, just as the Great Depression was lifting, on the site used by contractors who built the Harbour Bridge.

The 1896 Gavioli organ was bought in 1950, around the time the ageing Phillips brothers from America sold Luna Park to Hopkins and Atkins.

For three quarters of a century Hopkins and his family lived in the house, but now it's up for sale

He had chosen the house to be close to his work and his family. They lived there for three quarters of a century. The auction for the house will take place on November 9.

Hopkins worked as an electrician at Adelaide's Glenelg fun park in 1930 when he was given the job of dismantling the roller coaster and bringing it by barge up to Milsons Point, Sydney where, in 1935, Luna Park was established.

Hopkins' second home was Luna Park in Sydney where he worked for most of his life   

Hopkins would head overseas to buy a new ride every winter when the park closed for maintenance. 

"It was my life," he said in 1989 about one of the most famous landmarks in Sydney.
