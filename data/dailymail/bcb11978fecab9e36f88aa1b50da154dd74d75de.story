A judge has ruled that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can be visited by his relatives without an FBI agent present.

The Boston Marathon bombing suspect had previously been watched during the visits, but his defense attorneys argued that there was no clear threat and the agent's presence prevented the family from speaking freely.

'This case is very much a story about a family and the relationships between them,' defense attorney David Bruck said in a court hearing on Wednesday.

The judge agreed with the defense's point, pushing past the prosecution's suggestion that the minder was needed for security.

'I donâ€™t think the safety, security issue looms very large,' US district judge George A. O'Toole Jr ruled.

The Boston Globe reported that the decision will not be final until the US Bureau of Prisons weighs in, and that is expected to take about two weeks.

The agent's presence is not only a question of security but could also have a role in the trial as it was earlier reported that during one of these visits, the agent allegedly heard Dzohkhar say something controversial in a heated exchange with his sister.

'Tsarnaev, despite the presence of an FBI agent and an employee of the federal public defender, was unable to temper his remarks and made a statement to his detriment which was overheard by the agent,' a late February court hearing stated.

Under a spell: The denfense s planning on describing how Dzhokhar was under his brother's control when he participated in the dual bombing at the Boston Marathon in 2013 (pictured: then-19-year-old Dzhokhar being captured)

Prosecutors later said that the remark was 'the driving force' behind Tsarnaev's defense team's decision to push for a change in the visitation procedure.

The strategy also suggests that the defense team is preparing to paint Dzhokhar, who was 19 at the time of last year's bombings, as under the mental control of his 26-year-old brother Tamerlan who was killed in a shoot out with police.

On Wednesday, the prosecutors also said that Tsarnaev's defense team will not have access to the growing file on a triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts in 2011 that Tamerlan was apparently involved in.

Police were looking into the connection and interviewing a friend of Tamerlan's named Ibragim Todashev in Florida when Todashev attacked the investigating agents and was shot dead.

Paying respects: The court decisions come just one day after the anniversary of the bombings (the Boylston Street finish line pictured on Tuesday during a memorial ceremony)

The prosecution in Dzhokhar's case admitted that it does not appear that the suspect had any knowledge of his brother's involvement in the 2011 case so there is no reason to connect it to the Boston Marathon case.

They also said that by releasing the case file on the 2011 triple slaying could be potentially detrimental to the renewed investigation into that case.

This is an important week in the case, if not necessarily for the ongoing federal trial process but because Tuesday marked the one-year anniversary of the double bombing at the finish line that left three spectators dead and more than more than 260 injured.
