During arduous missions, Major Rob Dyer recognized his troops needed something to keep their energy up without any negative side-effects, and an idea was born.

The result of his 2008 on-field epiphany was Ruck Pack, a liquid energy shot that contains essential vitamins and minerals to provide energy without caffeine.

Dyer developed the product to help weary troops recover quickly from fatigue and dehydration under battlefield conditions with minimal down-time.

He was frustrated by having to take up to twenty pills and capsules per day to maintain health while in the field when he began thinking about a single-source vitamin and energy shot that would deliver maximum nutrition and energy for performance and endurance.

'Stressful': Dyer spent all the money he'd saved for his family's future investing in Ruck Pack

Dyer, who has served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, says Ruck Pack is a combination of energy drink and dietary supplement.

The shot is intended for soldiers dealing with the rigors of war, but Dyer says it's useful to civilians wanting to sustain peak mental and physical performance.

'We knew that whatever nutrition supplements we wanted to create, they needed to fit everybody else’s needs and not just troops,' Dyer told ABC.

The two-ounce shot, which is peach flavored and contains vitamins B6 and B12, gingko biloba, St. John’s wort, ginseng, chondroitin, potassium, magnesium, calcium and L-Glutamine, is the first Dyer and his company Noots! Nutrition, have created.

Dyer's product, 
unlike other energy shots on the market, contains 'No empty energy. No 
niacin flush. No shakes. No jolt. No crash. No nasty chemical 
aftertaste.'

The company focuses on 'attitude, 
sharp cognitive skills, strong bones, electrolyte charged bodies, good 
circulation, strong muscles, healthy joints, and a responsive immune 
system.'

'We didn’t want to 
be another ‘energy pouch’ and all we do is fill that void of nutrition that 
you’re supposed to be getting in food anyway,' said Dyer.

Entrepreneur: Rob Dyer was a decorated Marine when he had the idea for Ruck Pack energy shots

When Dyer left the armed forces, he invested everything he had into Ruck Pack.

'I
did it because I believed in the company and where it was going.

'But 
when you come back and you return to your family and you realize that 
you have taken all your cash away from all your future planning with 
your family, there are definitely some stressful times,' he told ABC.

Tank bank: His appearance on ABC's Shark Tank earned Dyer $150,000 in investments from two of the show's panel

Dyer needn't have worried though - Ruck Pack is going from strength to strength.

In November last year, the vet appeared on ABC's Shark Tank to try to gain financial support to grow his business.

It wasn't his first shot. He'd previously entered the show with Ruck Pack but he never made it past the first round. This time, however, he made it all the way and left the show with $150,000 investment money from Kevin O’Leary and Robert Herjave.

Ruck Pack is stocked around the country at various retailers including selected 7/11 stores, health foods stores, cafes and Meijers pharmacies.
