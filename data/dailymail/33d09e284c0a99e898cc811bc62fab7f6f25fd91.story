A child sex abuse victim of an Australian man at the centre of a surrogacy storm says pedophiles shouldn't have children and she's disgusted he has a baby daughter.

David Farnell was placed in the international spotlight after a Thailand surrogate mother alleged he and his wife abandoned his Down Syndrome son Gammy and returned to Australia with the healthier twin sister, now seven-month-old Pipah.

Questions have been raised over Mr Farnell's suitability for surrogacy after it emerged he was jailed in 1997 for indecently dealing with three girls.

One of Mr Farnell's victims, using the pseudonym Sarah, has spoken about the impact of the offences.

The Farnells, pictured here with Gammy's twin sister Pipah, have been at the centre of the surrogacy scandal after Ms Janbua claimed they left Gammy in Thailand because of his disability

'The damage is done and it can take years to repair,' she told The West Australian newspaper.

'It's my belief he should not have any children - not just him, all pedophiles.'

The 39-year-old said she feared for Pipah's safety.

'We need to stop putting these perpetrators first ... because there are so many innocent babies and children that are abused day in, day out.

'It's disgusting.'

Earlier this month the adult daughter of Mr Farnell broken her silence to admit she was responsible for whispers that the Farnells believed baby Gammy was dead.

In an interview published by local newspaper The Bunbury Mail, Jane Farnell said she had told friends the baby, who has Down Syndrome, had died because it was simpler than 'dragging them into all the confusion'.

'My parents never said Gammy had died, that came from me,' the newspaper quoted Ms Farnell saying.

'The only reason I told my friends that he had died was that it was easier than dragging them all into the confusion.'

'I thought it would be easier to say he had passed away and then have to explain it later on if he came home.'

Ms Farnell added that baby Gammy's twin sister, Pipah, was a happy little girl who only cried during teething.

She said that Mr Farnell, a convicted child sex offender had done a 'terrible thing' in the past, but she believed in the integrity of the child protection system.

Ms Janbua claimed on Thai Rath News that David and Wendy Farnell asked her to abort both children when she was seven months pregnant

Pattharamon Janbua claimed on Thai Rath News that David and Wendy Farnell asked her to abort both children when she was seven months pregnant.

Ms Janbua also said the agents and doctors caring for were aware that Gammy had Down Syndrome early into her pregnancy.

'It was the agent ... she said that they (the Farnells) wanted to abort both of the children'. Ms Janbua told the program, adding she broke down in tears when she received this news.

'She said that the parents had been very shocked and frightened... they were insisting on the abortion. I said I couldn't do that... cause I was seven months into the pregnancy already.'

Ms Janbua said she was then given the option to abort just one of the children - the one with a disability - though she still refused this as she believed she was too far into the pregnancy.

'They told me that the child would have to be injected with some drugs (or poison) to take his life and then be taken out by surgical process. Then the girl would go into the incubator right away ... these words have since then stayed in my head', Ms Janbua revealed.
