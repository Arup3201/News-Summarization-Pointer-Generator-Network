If Susan Rice is nominated to be the next Secretary of State, she could face fierce opposition from Republicans in Congress.

But now it has emerged that she could also lack support closer to home, as Hillary Clinton has said she would prefer John Kerry to succeed her as America's top diplomat.

The ambassador to the UN is considered the frontrunner for the high-powered job, despite coming under fire from the GOP for her role in the government's response to the Benghazi attack.

Feud? Hillary Clinton is apparently opposed to the idea of Susan Rice becoming Secretary of State

However, Clinton is apparently not keen for her to take over, according to a report in the Chicago Sun-Times, and instead supports Kerry, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

'Hillary is not close to Rice, who is tough but is not the friendliest person,' a White House source told the newspaper.

'And Hillary's brief comment recently that Rice had done "a great job" was considered underwhelming and tepid.'

Earlier this week, the outgoing Secretary of State claimed to be a fan of Rice, saying: 'Susan Rice has done a great job as our ambassador to the United Nations.

'Of course, this decision about my successor is up to the President, but I am very happy he has the opportunity with a second term to make a decision.'

Frontrunner: But Rice will face fierce Republican opposition is she is nominated by Barack Obama

Rice, 48, got her start in politics from Hillary's husband Bill, working on his 1992 presidential campaign before being appointed to the National Security Council.

She then served as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs from 1997 to 2001.

Obama is widely believed to favour her as Hillary's successor - partly because appointing Kerry could lead to a tough battle for the Democrats to hold on to his Massachusetts Senate seat.

But Rice has become a hate figure for senior Republicans such as John McCain, who has threatened to block her appointment if she is nominated by Barack Obama.

Alternative: John Kerry is also believed to be in the running for the post of America's top diplomat

The GOP opposition stems from a series of television interviews Rice gave in the days after the assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11, when she insisted that the raid stemmed from protests against an American-made video mocking the Prophet Muhammad.

That claim has since been debunked - but Rice now says she was simply relying on an assessment provided to her by intelligence agencies.

While McCain and others appeared to soften their opposition to Rice last week, after a meeting with her on Tuesday they reiterated their concerns and again threatened to stop her becoming Secretary of State.
