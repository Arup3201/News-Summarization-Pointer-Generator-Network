Getting around: The elderly are being put off visiting Britain's town and city centres because of a lack of public toilets and places to sit, a study has found

The elderly are being put off visiting Britain’s town and city centres because of a lack of public toilets and places to sit, a study has found.

Failings in the design and planning of centres are deterring older people from venturing in. Campaigners said they are being made to feel ‘left behind by society’.

Researchers asked a group of older people with differing levels of mobility to recount their experiences of a visit to Leeds.

The participants, who were mainly in 
their late 60s and 70s, were asked to pinpoint aspects that made their 
experience in shops, streets and markets and on public transport both 
easier and more difficult.

For many, the basic difficulty of getting around the city over-rode any positive aspects they reported.

Several complained that a lack of public lavatories was a major obstacle to their enjoyment of the city.

Others,
 including some suffering from conditions such as asthma, complained 
that there had been little consideration of the need for benches and 
seats to enable them to take short breaks as they walked around.

They described the seats that were available as ‘uninviting’ and were arranged in a way that tended to be isolating.

The findings were presented in a 
research paper by a team of design, transport experts and engineers at 
Leeds University. The authors highlighted how simple problems such as a 
shortage of seating in streets or a lack of post boxes are deterring 
many older people from venturing into city centres.

They
 urged councils and retailers to work together to make simple changes to
 avoid excluding the fastest-growing section of Britain’s population 
from the heart of major towns and cities.

Dr
 Kishore Budha, the lead author of the report, said: ‘For older people 
there are simple things like toilets and seating which seem to be 
completely forgotten.

‘The participants noticed that even in
 new shopping centres with excellent modern disabled access, the 
lavatories were often situated on the third or fourth floor. We seem to 
get the whole thing wrong. It appears that the provision of ramps and 
lifts is enough and that we have ticked the box.

‘Subtly
 what this is saying is “don’t use this as a public facility, we will 
make it difficult for you to use the toilets in the built environment”.’

Mervyn
 Kohler, who carries out similar surveys for Age UK, said: ‘This is 
increasing [older people’s] sense of being left behind by society, which
 regards them as “past it”.

‘That sense of being a second-class citizen is something that a lot of older people feel quite bitter about.

‘If
 that impacts on their ability to enjoy life and get out and socialise 
and get about independently, then we are eroding their quality of life 
in a serious way.'
