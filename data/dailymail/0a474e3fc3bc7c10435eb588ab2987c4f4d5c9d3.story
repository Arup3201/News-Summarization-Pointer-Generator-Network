Raul Sanchez Fuentes Villota can be sent back to Spain despite claiming he had previously been tortured there

A suspected terrorist who spent 17 years on the run can be sent back to Spain despite claiming he had previously been tortured with pencils there, a court ruled today.

Raul Sanchez Fuentes Villota, 46, allegedly a member of the separatist group ETA, is wanted over charges linked to a foiled car bomb attack on a police officer in June 1991.

He skipped bail in 1995 and was arrested in Liverpool in November last year after a European Arrest Warrant was made in the Spanish courts.

He told a hearing last month he was tortured while being held in 'incommunicado' detention by Spanish police in 1991, including having pencils placed between his fingers and squeezed to inflict pain on his hands.

His barrister argued at that hearing that the British courts could not be confident that Spain would deal with the torture allegations properly.

But District Judge Nicholas Evans, sitting at Westminster Magistrates' Court today, said Spain was a 'trusted extradition partner' and a decision on whether any evidence had been obtained by torture should be left to a court there.

He also questioned whether ill-treatment suffered by Fuentes could be deemed "torture".

Ordering Fuentes be extradited, District Judge Evans said: 'I'm persuaded by such evidence that I have heard that it is more likely than not the requested person (Fuentes) suffered the pencil treatment.

'I'm not persuaded he was tortured.'

Fuentes is wanted in Spain to face allegations of membership of a terrorist organisation (ETA), an attack in conjunction with attempted murder, possession of guns and possession of explosives.

He was initially arrested in 1991 on suspicion of attempting to place explosives in a police officer's car and possession of a firearm.

He was released on bail in June 1995 but went missing two months later. It is not known how long he was living in Liverpool.

He appeared via videolink for today's hearing.

Wearing a blue polo shirt and glasses he displayed no emotion when the judge ordered his extradition.

He has seven days to lodge an appeal.
