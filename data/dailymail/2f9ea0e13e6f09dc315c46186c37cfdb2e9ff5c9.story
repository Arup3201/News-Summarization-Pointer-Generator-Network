Devastated: Parents Emma and Terry Charlton fought a two-year battle with a hospital when their baby was wrongly certified as being stillborn after fatal mistakes by staff

A mother fought a two-year battle with a hospital when her baby was wrongly certified as being stillborn after fatal  mistakes by staff.

Ava Mae Charlton was born by emergency caesarean section but she struggled to breathe and died after only 32 minutes.

Hospital officials tried to claim the baby was stillborn and so her death did not need to be investigated. But her parents Emma and Terry Charlton always maintained their daughter had been alive.

They fought for an inquest until – after two years – the hospital finally admitted that Ava had not been stillborn, allowing the scrutiny of a hearing.

Her death followed those of two other babies at Milton Keynes Hospital in similar circumstances, when the mothers had to wait for a caesarean to be carried out.

Following the latest tragedy, coroner Tom Osborne has ordered managers to report all stillbirths and neonatal deaths to him for further investigation.

Mrs Charlton, a teacher, 31, said:  ‘People questioned my sanity and it was infuriating because I knew my baby had been alive. I was grief-stricken and  vulnerable and you just accept what health professionals tell you.

‘But when they handed me that  stillborn certificate, I knew something wasn’t right. Then a meeting with our consultant opened up a whole can of worms and highlighted a number of errors that had been made.’ 

Ava’s death in September 2009 came when the maternity unit was still reeling from criticism into the death of another baby, Ebony McCall, four months before. Then, Mr Osborne had condemned staff shortages which contributed to her demise as ‘nothing short of scandalous’.

The deaths of the two girls bear an uncanny resemblance. Both went into distress and both mothers had to wait a considerable time for caesareans.

Ava, like Ebony, would very probably be alive today had the surgery been carried out sooner, the inquest heard.

The loss of a third baby girl, Romy Feast in 2007 in similar circumstances, in the same unit also prompted criticism from the coroner at the time.

Mr Osborne delivered a narrative verdict at Ava’s inquest at Milton Keynes Coroner’s Court.

‘There was a failure to recognise the seriousness of her (Ava’s) condition and a delay in carrying out the emergency caesarean section,’ he said.

The coroner ruled that if the surgery had been carried out earlier ‘on the balance of probabilities Ava would have survived’.

Mrs Charlton, of Milton Keynes, was admitted when 36 weeks’ pregnant, suffering with pre-eclampsia, the court heard.

She had previously had an MRI scan which showed she had a ‘borderline pelvis’ making a  natural delivery risky.

But Mrs Charlton was not told of this risk and was not given the option of a caesarean section.

Instead, she was induced and a short time later, began to bleed with Ava becoming distressed in the womb, the court was told.

But doctors delayed the decision to carry out an emergency caesarean for one hour and 25 minutes.

When it was finally performed, the baby was born in a ‘very poor condition’ and despite resuscitation, died shortly after.

After last month’s inquest, Mrs Charlton and her husband, who works in graphics, will finally be able to register Ava’s birth.

The couple, who later had another daughter, Isla, now two, said they were devastated by the hospital’s blunder.

‘It has taken us years to get to this stage and we feel quite bitter it took this long for the hospital to concede they had made a mistake,’ said Mrs Charlton.

‘They have destroyed my life and took my child away. It is utterly devastating and has totally changed me.

‘This is not the first case where the hospital has been forced to face questions about its practice of declaring babies “stillborn”, thereby avoiding an inquest.

‘It is particularly distressing that our baby would still be with us today had the caesarean taken place earlier. Hopefully the verdict will be acted upon so other parents will be spared the pain we have had to endure simply to discover the truth.’

As a direct result of Ava’s death, the coroner has ruled that all stillbirths and neonatal deaths in his area will have to reported so he can decide if an inquest should be called.

Hospital medical director Martin Wetherill said maternity services had been significantly improved, ensuring such an incident should never occur again.

He added: ‘Clinical staff made an error in classifying Ava as a stillbirth.’ The hospital has apologised for the ‘unimaginable distress’ caused by her death.

Its maternity services were given a clean bill of health by inspectors in April 2011.
