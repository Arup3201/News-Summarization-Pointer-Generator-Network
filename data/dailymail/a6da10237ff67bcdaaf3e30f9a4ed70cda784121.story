A home owned by talk show host Conan O'Brien and used by his parents has been removed from a Rhode Island auction after he paid some back taxes on the property.

Town officials told The Westerly Sun that Mr O'Brien, who has an estimated net worth of about $75 million,  paid his $8,000 bill on Friday morning.

The property near the Westerly shore is valued at about $723,000. It was among several the town planned to auction on Tuesday to settle delinquent tax bills.

Conan O'Brien on Friday paid $8,000 in back taxes on this Rhode Island house, saving it from being sold off at auction

'As soon as I was made aware that the tax bill on my parents' house was being mailed to the wrong address, I paid the bill immediately,' Mr O'Brien said in a statement. 'The problem has been corrected. I am grateful to the reporter at the Westerly Sun who spotted this error and notified me.'

Mr O'Brien publicist Drew Shane earlier had issued a statement saying the host had been unaware he owed back taxes. He blamed the problem on a clerical error that prevented the bill from reaching Mr O'Brien's accountant in Los Angeles.

Property records show the house, located just across the street from a marina and boat yard, under the name of Mr O'Brien's parents, Thomas and Ruth O'Brien. The median income in the area is $127,000 and median home value $928,000.

The 51-year-old comedian, who was born Conan Christopher O'Brien, grew up in neighboring Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard, where his father is a professor at the medical school.

He has written for Saturday Night Live and the Simpsons and hosted Late Night with Conan O'Brien on NBC for 16 years. 

He briefly took over for Jay Leno on the Tonight Show but a dispute with NBC led to his departure in 2010. He switched networks to TBS and has been hosting Conan since then.
