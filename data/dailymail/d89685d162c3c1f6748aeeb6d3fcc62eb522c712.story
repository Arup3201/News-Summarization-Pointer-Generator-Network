A miniature train that has ferried passengers around Houston’s Hermann Park for nearly 50 years smashed into a car on Sunday.

Video shows the car sitting on the tracks just in front of the oncoming train near the Houston Zoo.

And while the train is small, it appeared to pack a punch as it nearly flipped the car over.

Scroll down for video...

How does this happen? A mini passenger train collided Sunday with a Honda Accord at Houston's Hermann Park

It’s unclear why the car was there, but logic would follow that someone decided some train tracks were an appropriate place to park a car.

At one third the size of an old steam train, the replica 1863 C.P. Huntington doesn’t look all that daunting.

But the owners of a gold Honda Accord are no doubt wishing they’d had more respect for the locomotive’s power.

Thankfully, no one was injured in the collision, but one man can be heard calmly telling fellow passengers to ‘hold on,’ prior to impact.

One child’s well-timed groan at the end of the video sums up the experience appropriately.

Hear the train a'comin'? A passenger happened to be recording a video just as the train made its way around a bend

'Hold on...': After the bend, a car can clearly be seen sitting directly atop the tracks. The passenger reactions make clear they see the impending collision, but they aren't exactly terrified screams

Impact: The train smashes into the car and is powerful enough to upend up end it

The train has made loops around Houston's Hermann Park for nearly 50 years but a Honda Accord couldn't seem to get out of the way
