David Cameron was involved in an 
extraordinary stand-up row with Argentina’s president Cristina Fernandez
de Kirchner yesterday over the future of the Falkand Islands.

The South American leader appeared to 
attempt to thrust a package stuffed with documents about her country’s 
claim to the British territory into Mr Cameron’s hands at the G20 summit
in Mexico.

To her fury, the Prime Minister 
refused to accept it – and insisted that she respect the views of the 
islanders, who want to remain British.

Tension: Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner attempted to hand Mr Cameron a package marked 'UN - Malvinas' but the Prime Minister refused to accept it

The two leaders met in a corridor on the fringes of the summit, apparently after Mr Cameron sought her out.

Witnesses said the A4 envelope was marked ‘UN/Malvinas’ – a reference to Argentina’s name for the islands.

The Prime Minister told Mrs Kirchner: 
‘I am not proposing a full discussion now on the Falklands but I hope 
you have noted that they are holding a referendum and you should respect
their views. We should believe in self-determination and act as 
democrats here in the G20.’

Strained: Relations between Britain and Argentina are in the deep freeze after Buenos Aires tried to use the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War to revive its claim on the islands it knows as the Malvinas

Falkland residents announced plans for
a referendum next year in an attempt to fend off Argentinian claims to 
the territory, which have become more vocal around the 30th anniversary 
of the 1982 war.

Mr Cameron said later: ‘I told 
Kirchner that if she believes in democracy then she should respect the 
will of the people of the Falklands, and I wanted to use this 
opportunity to tell her this, which I did with some vigour.’

One witness said Mrs Kirchner 
responded to Mr Cameron with ‘some ramblings about Spanish headlines, UN
and Malvinas’. They added: ‘Her interpreter couldn’t keep up.’

The conversation apparently ended when
Mr Cameron walked off. A Downing Street official said: ‘If they do want
to give us a letter, then it’s easy enough to find the UK delegation 
office at the G20.

‘But we don’t need an envelope from Kirchner to know what the UN resolutions say.’

They added: ‘All the UN resolutions 
refer to the UN charter, which enshrines the principle of 
self-determination and that is what we are asking the Argentines to 
respect.’
