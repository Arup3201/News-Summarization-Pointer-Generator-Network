There have long been stories about the incredible connection that some identical twins share.

Some claim to be able to tell what their twin is thinking, and others say they know if their sibling is unhappy even when they are apart.

Now one pair of twin sisters say they have even shared labour pains.

Leanne Humphreys developed unexplained stomach cramps just as her sister Vickii’s waters were about to break.

Moments after Leanne developed stomach pains, Vickii went into labour.

The following morning Vickii's daughter, Ava-Jai, was born. Leanne already had a baby son, called Harry.

Like many twins, Leanne and Vickii, from Bolton, are very close.

The pair have experienced headaches at the same time and conceived within six months of each other.

But last year the identical twins, 20, took their sisterly bond one step further when Leanne felt Vickii go into labour.

Leanne said: ‘We have always been close. When we were younger we were inseparable and things are exactly the same now.

‘We have always had a special bond and have experienced matching headaches before.

‘Once I was at work and I had an awful headache so I got sent home. When I got home Vickii was already there and when I asked what she was doing she said she had been sent home with a headache too. It was weird.

Leanne (pictured) was sitting down watching television when she suddenly suffered severe stomach cramps. Just a few moments later, Vickii's waters broke and she went into labour

‘When I found out I was pregnant in September 2012 I told Vickii straight away. She was a great auntie from the start and was there for me all the way through my pregnancy.’

Leanne’s son Harry was born in April 2013, but just three weeks before he was born, Vickii announced that she was expecting too.

Leanne said: ‘I was eight months pregnant when Vickii told me she was expecting. I couldn’t believe it.

Vickii and Leanne say they hope their children will be as close as they are

We have always done everything together and it felt so special that both our babies would be born in the same year.’

The twins, who live together with their parents, have always been described by their parents Julie and Gary as ‘miracle babies’ after they were conceived through IVF.

Leanne helped coach Vickii through her pregnancy and Vickii witnessed and experienced new-motherhood by being there for Leanne.

Leanne said: ‘By the time Vickii was at the end of her pregnancy I think she was well-equipped. She had been there to help me feed and change Harry so she knew exactly what it was going to be like when it was her turn.’

As Vickii’s due date drew closer Leanne did everything to talk her twin through the labour. 

Vickii (left) said: 'I think it's amazing that Leanne had labour sympathy pains for me. We have shared everything else together, so why not this?'

Then on Sunday December 1, the twins’ closeness became clearer than ever when Leanne felt Vickii go into labour.

Leanne said: ‘Vickii was three days overdue and we were sat in the living room together watching TV.

‘Suddenly I had the most horrendous pain ripping through my stomach. I told Vickii I was feeling ill and two minutes later she got up and hobbled into the bathroom.

‘I sat on my own rubbing my belly and Vickii shouted to me and asked me to go upstairs. I went into the bathroom and her waters had broken. I couldn’t believe it. It was like I had felt her labour pains.

‘I continued to have the stomach pains while Vickii was in labour and nothing could seem to get rid of them. It’s as though I was sharing the labour with her. It just shows how connected we are.’

Vickii said: ‘Ava and Harry are definitely going to grow up to be best friends as well as cousins.

‘We really want them to go to the same school when they are older and we will definitely be having family holidays and days out together.

‘I think it’s amazing that Leanne had labour sympathy pains for me. We have shared everything else together, so why not this?’
