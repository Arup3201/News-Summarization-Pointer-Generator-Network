It was a disappointing night of Europa League football for English teams with only Everton progressing to the round of 16 after a 7-2 aggregate win against Young Boys on Thursday.

Liverpool were beaten on penalties by Besiktas after losing the second leg 1-0 in Istanbul, while Tottenham fell to a 2-0 defeat in Florence as Fiorentina beat Mauricio Pochettino's side 3-1 on aggregate.

Roberto Martinez's side have been drawn against Ukraine outfit Dynamo Kiev.

A quick reminder that the dates for the round of 16 ties are March 12 and 19.

And that concludes the coverage of the coverage of the Europa League draw.

Everton vs Dynamo Kiev

Dnipro vs Ajax

Zenit vs Torino

Wolfsburg vs Inter Milan

Villarreal vs Sevilla

Napoli vs Dynamo Moscow

Brugge vs Besiktas

Fiorentina vs Roma

Roberto Martinez would surely have been hoping to avoid a long trip to eastern Europe but the Toffees will face Ukrainian outfit Dynamo Kiev for a place in the last eight of the Europa League.

That concludes the draw for the round of 16 with some interesting clashes pulled out of the hat.

The all Italian affair between Fiorentina, who beat Tottenham on Thursday night, and Roma looks to be the tie of the round, while Villarreal and Sevilla should be a decent encounter too.

The round of 16 matches will take place on March 12 and 19.

There are no seeded teams or country protection in the round of 16, however the UEFA emergency panel have taken the decision that teams from Russia and Ukraine shall, for obvious reasons, not be drawn together.

The first two pairings will therefore involve both Ukrainian teams in the competition, Dynamo Kiev and Dnipro.

The draw is set to start shortly after midday in Nyon.
