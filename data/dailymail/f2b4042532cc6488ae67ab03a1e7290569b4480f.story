A horse pulling a buggy in the heart of Pennsylvania’s Amish country has been killed in a drive-by shooting.

Five people, who have not been identified, were inside the buggy on Sunday night when a car drove by and a shot was fired.

None of the passengers were injured in the incident, which happened in Ronks, in southeastern Lancaster County.

Shock: Five unidentified people were inside the buggy on Sunday night when a car drove by and a shot was fired - none were injured

The horse was discovered to be critically injured when the buggy arrived at a farm about a mile away, according to WHTM-TV.

The animal had suffered a bullet wound to the left side of its torso and died before a veterinarian could arrive.

In 2006, a shooting occurred at the West Nickel Mines School, an Amish one-room schoolhouse in the Old Order Amish community of Nickel Mines, a village in Bart Township of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

The gunman Charles Carl Roberts IV took hostages and shot 10 girls between the ages of 6 and 13, killing five, before committing suicide in the schoolhouse.

Like the old days: The Pennsylvania Amish live a lifestyle that closely resembles what it was like in the 18th century

Lancaster County, sometimes nicknamed the Garden Spot of America or Pennsylvania Dutch Country, has a population of about 63,000 Amish people.

The Pennsylvania Amish live a lifestyle that closely resembles what it was like in the 18th century – simple and non-materialistic, with horse-powered vehicles and a slow daily pace.

They focus their life on service to God, their family and the community and shun the modern day technology, such as television and cars.
