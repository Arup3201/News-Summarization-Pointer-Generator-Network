Once derided as a novelty, Tesla’s Model S is now outselling many major brands in California.

Tesla has recently overtaken Buick, Cadillac, Chrysler, Fiat, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mitsubishi, and Porsche in sales in the Golden State. Even more impressive, Tesla is doing it with only one model while the other car makers roll several models off assembly lines.

Tesla is also the third-highest selling luxury car brand in the state, according to a California New Car Dealers Association report, trailing only BMW and Mercedes.

Tesla surpassed Buick, Fiat, Land Rover, Lincoln, and Mitsubishi in the light-duty vehicle category, accounting for 0.6 per cent of sales, the trade group reported.

Despite costing more than $70,000, Tesla managed to outperform Cadillac, Chrysler and Porsche’s entire product lines for the month of June, according to the trade group.

This is no fluke, hybrids account for seven per cent of the state’s vehicle sales, up from just over six per cent last year, according to the report. Cars running solely on plug-in juice accounted for one per cent of sales state-wide.

Almost half of all the vehicles sold this year have been bought in California, according to Green Car Congress.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also guaranteed to buyback all cars at 50 per cent of their original sale price – after only three years, likely another driver in sales.

Rising sales and positive buzz have sent the company’s stock soaring to around $161 a share, putting it’s valuation at just under half that of Chrysler, according to the New York Times.

What seemed unfeasible only a year ago now seems like a no-brainer. Musk said in a recent interview that selling 40,000 of the vehicles a year is a ‘pretty safe’ bet.
