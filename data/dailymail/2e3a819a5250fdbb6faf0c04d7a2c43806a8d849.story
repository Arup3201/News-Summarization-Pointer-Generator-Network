A Melbourne couple could be charged for giving their three-year-old son medicinal cannabis who was suffering from hundreds of life-threatening seizures a day.

Under doctor's supervision, Cassie Batten and Rhett Wallace use cannabis oil to treat Cooper's severe epileptic seizures as he did not respond to any other medication.

However Victorian police raided the family's Mernda home, north-east of Melbourne, and seized all the supply - leaving his parents fearful that they will lose their son.

Meanwhile, there are more than 100,000 patients who legally access prescription cannabis in the US with 285 of them being under the age of 18. And there's also a burgeoning market which provides 'weed for kids'.

Cooper would suffer from hundreds of life-threatening seizures a day if it wasn't for his medicinal marijuana

Upon receiving treatment through medicinal cannabis, Cooper's seizures have significantly reduced from hundreds a day to just two or three.

Although Cooper was born a healthy child, one month later he contracted meningitis which left him with severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy.

Cooper's marijuana oil, which is put into his milk before he is fed, has removed the ingredient which drug users get their high from.

His parents are certain that  if it wasn't for the cannabis tincture their son wouldn't be here today.

'Without the cannabis oil we wouldn't have our son today,' Mr Wallace told Channel Seven's Sunday Night program.

'We would be visiting him in a cemetery.

'We know that without the cannabis tincture – that's a death sentence to Cooper.'

But according to the Australian law, Mr Wallace and Ms Batten's only chance to save their son is seen as illegal.

'I understand that we're breaking the law but we're doing it to save out son,' Ms Batten said.

'We're not doing it out of pleasure, we're doing it because we have to.'

The pair, who have no criminal history, say they shouldn't be treated like criminals.

'We're not criminals, we're simply trying to save our child,' Ms Batten said.

The distraught mother also revealed on Sunday Night that she may have her son taken away by authorities after receiving increasing phone calls from the Department of Health Services.

'That's our biggest fear' Ms Batten said.

'Are they trying to say that we're not caring for him, we're not meeting his needs when doctors said that they've seen the opposite. That they've seen improvement with this treatment.'

And while Australia continues the ongoing debate for legalisation of medicinal marijuana, Colorado - one of the 23 states in the US which permits cannabis use for patients - is meeting the high demands of weed for kids.

Cannabis cultivator Joel Stanley and his growing what's called Charlotte's Web which is specifically for intractable epilepsy

Cannabis cultivator Joel Stanley and his brothers are growing what's called Charlotte's Web, reported 60 Minutes.

The strain - which is named after Charlotte Figi who's severe condition changed the laws in Colorado - is specially grown for 100s patients with intractable epilepsy.

'Most of those cases are paediatric cases,' Mr Stanley said.

'It's quite controversial - weed for kids. That's what we grow it for.'

Mr Stanley explained that Charlotte's Web has a low dose of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and more cannabidiol (CBD).

'It is low in THC which makes it hemp strength,' Mr Stanley said.

Although there are no studies which prove that medicinal cannabis for children is safe in the long term, there are 8000 others on the waiting list to get their hands on Charlotte's Web.

They include Australian mother Sally White, who is considering moving to the US for her daughter.

'It's ridiculous. There are other children who are taking medical marijuana through illegal means,' she said.

'We don't want to do that...our only option is to go to America.'

Her 16-month-old daughter Zahlia was diagnosed with Aicardi Syndrome - a rare genetic disorder - at 12 weeks of age. She, like Cooper, suffers from daily seizures.

'What do you do? Do you watch her seizure until she dies?' Ms White asked.

Ms White, like Cassie Batten and Rhett Wallace, believes medicinal marijuana can save her child's life and she want the Australian government to act now before it's too late.

'Being a politician, they would do something if it was their kid,' she said.

'But they obviously don't have sick kids.'
