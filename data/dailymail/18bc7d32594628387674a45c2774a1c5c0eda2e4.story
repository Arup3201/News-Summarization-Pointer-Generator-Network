Los Angeles police have been accused of resorting to 'street justice' in the hunt for suspected killer ex-cop Christopher Dorner, after they mistakenly shot a 71-year-old woman delivering newspapers and left her truck riddled with bullets.

The victim, Emma Hernandez, said the officers did not give any warning or commands and just began firing at her blue pickup truck, according to her attorney. Her 47-year-old daughter was a passenger in the car at the time.

'Tragically, we believe this is a case of mistaken identity,' Charlie Beck, chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, said about the incident.

Victim: Emma Hernandez, left, was shot twice in the back and was hospitalized in stable condition

Injured: The driver's daughter, 47-year-old Maggie Carranza, right, was a passenger in the truck and was injured by broken glass

Hernandez was shot twice in the back and was hospitalized in stable condition. Her daughter, Margie Carranza, was a passenger in the truck at the time of the shooting. She was wounded by glass from the shattered window.

The two women were distributing copies of the Los Angeles Times before the terrifying incident. They were driving an aqua blue Toyota Tacoma unlike the description of the Dorner's vehicle, a gray Nissan Titan.

When police began firing and gunshots entered through the back windshield of the truck, the terrified women just 'covered their faces and huddled down,' the attorney for the two victims told the Los Angeles Times.

The police gunfire came from officers who were protecting a department captain and his family who had been included on the fugitive's hit list.

Six LAPD officers who had fired at Hernandez's vehicle have been placed on administrative leave.

Mistake: Police thought the blue pickup truck driven by Emma Hernandez belonged to the suspected shooter on the loose

Hit: The 71-year-old driver was shot in the back. Her daughter was a passenger in the car and was injured by broken glass

Wanted: Los Angeles Police believe Christopher Dorner is responsible for killing three people and officers have launched a massive search for the former cop

The women's lawyer, Glen Jonas, told 
the Times LAPD not follow protocol or the rules of engagement before 
they decided to exercise deadly force.

'With no warning, no command, or no instructions, LAPD opened fire on their vehicle,' Jonas said.

'This wasn't even close,' their attorney said. 

'This was two petite Latina women 
versus a large black man, with a different vehicle, different color. The
 police didn't take the time to do the identification.  They didn't 
give  the "suspect" the opportunity to surrender. So the whole thing was
 just mishandled, and we expect that the city will acknowledge that and 
go from there.'

LAPD Cmdr. Andrew 
Smith says the department's Chief Charlie Beck met with the women in 
their Torrance home Saturday to apologize and tell them he had arranged 
for someone to donate a new pickup truck.

The truck will be donated early this week, Smith said.

Dorner, who is wanted in connection 
to three homicides, has been described as 'armed and extremely 
dangerous' and residents have been told to be vigilant and report any 
sightings.

On Friday, police put the area of Big Bear about 100 miles from Los Angeles, on lockdown as they searched the alleged shooter.

Mistake: Police also shot at this black Honda pickup just minutes after mistaking Hernandez's blue truck for the vehicle belonging to Dorner

Suspect: Police believe Dorner was last driving this gray Nissan Titan

Police
 bloodhounds and heavily-armed SWAT officers in combat fatigues tracked a
 set of footprints in the snow and 125 cops checked every home in the 
community of about 400.

It's
 been more than a day since there's been a confirmed sighting, leading 
investigators to worry Dorner is far away from California.

Hernandez was driving a pickup truck 
at 5:30am, which police mistook it for the vehicle that belonged to 
Dorner and the officers began firing bullets into the blue truck.

Just
 moments after the first shooting at around 5:45am, police located 
another pickup truck, which was a dark color, and began shooting at it.

A male passenger inside the truck was not hit.

Hernandez and her daughter are expected to recover from their injuries but have retained an attorney.

'There was no warning, there was no orders or no commands… just gunshots,' Jonas told KTLA-TV.

Their attorney said that the blue truck was 'the wrong color and the wrong model' compared to the description of Dorner's car.

Suspect: Christopher Dorner is seen on a surveillance video at an Orange County hotel on January 28, 2013 in this new surveillance footage released by the Irvine Police Department on Friday

Alert: Police commissioned a billboard to warn residents to report any sightings of former LAPD Officer Christopher

He
 accused police of not taking 'the time to notice that these two older, 
small Latina women didn’t look like a large black man.'

'We trust that the LAPD will step up 
and do the right thing and acknowledge that what they did was 
unacceptable and we'll deal with it,' Jonas said.

He said his clients were 'extremely traumatized.' They’re just trying to make sense of what happened. From their perspective, they’re sitting in a car, doing their job and a thunderstorm of bullets comes down.'

Dorner is wanted in connection to three homicides.

He could be anywhere at this point,' San Bernadino County Sheriff John McMahon said.

Police
 admit Dorner is highly trained and well-versed in their tactics and he 
has promised 'to bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those 
in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty.'

Dorner
 is presumed to be armed with multiple weapons, including an assault 
rifle, although his manifesto suggests he may be more heavily armed - 
possibly even with rocket launchers.

'Do
 not deploy airships or gunships. SA-7 Manpads will be waiting,' he said
 in his manifesto, referencing a Russian-made shoulder-launched missile 
launcher.

Let's talk: Charlie Sheen has posted a video encouraging Christopher Dorner to turn himself in

Dorner, who received medals for his service during the Iraq war, also earned accolades for his shooting skills.

He earned a rifle marksman ribbon and pistol expert medal, CBS reported.

He was also deployed to Bahrain and Kuwait in 2006 and 2007 as part of the Naval reserve.

On Sunday he allegedly murdered the 
daughter and future son-in-law of former LAPD Captain Randy Quan, who 
defended him at the disciplinary hearing where he was expelled from the 
police force.

Then on Thursday he launched a shooting spree, that claimed the life of a 34-year-old police trainer with 11-years on the force.

Hell raising actor Charlie Sheen has urged the fugitive former LAPD to contact him.

Dorner
 had mentioned Sheen along with a number of other celebrities in his 
online manifesto which also indicates his intentions to kill more 
people.

In the manifesto, Dorner wrote: ‘Charlie Sheen, you’re effin awesome.’

In a 17-second video message posted on Saturday on the TMZ website, Sheen seems to suggest that he is willing to mediate between Dorner and the police.

Dressed in a black shirt and speaking in short, direct sentences Sheen thanks Dorner for his 'kind words' and then asks the man to call him.

'Let's figure out together how to end this thing,' Sheen is recorded saying.

The LAPD haven’t commented on Sheen's message about the man who Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has warned citizens is a 'sick individual.'
