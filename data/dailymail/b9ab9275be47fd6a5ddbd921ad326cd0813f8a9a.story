President Barack Obama is telling Congress he may take further military action to protect Americans in violence-plagued South Sudan.

Obama says in a letter to Congress that about 46 U.S. troops were deployed Saturday to help evacuate Americans.

Four U.S. troops were injured in the evacuation mission when gunfire hit three military planes. All four are in stable condition.

Time to leave: An estimated 500 have already died in the violence so far. Above, a U.S. serviceman waits on the runway with American nationals who are being evacuated being evacuated on December 21

Obama is on his annual vacation in Hawaii. He says he's monitoring the situation and may take more steps to ensure the security of Americans, U.S. property and the U.S. Embassy in Juba.

Fighting has continued Sunday in South Sudan, where the central government has lost control of the capital of a key oil-producing state. The unrest has raised fears of full-blown civil war.

The four U.S. servicemen were wounded after their helicopter was shot at during an evacuation mission.

The men had been tasked with trying to rescue American citizens following outbreaks of violence in Bor, the capital of the South Sudan state of Jonglei, Saturday.

Targeted: Three CV-22 Osprey aircraft (shown in 2011 file photo) were shot at as U.S. servicemen worked to evacuate Americans in South Sudan on Saturday

The aircraft turned around after being fired at, before heading to Kampala in Uganda, according to US officials.

From there, the wounded servicemen were flown to Nairobi in Kenya for medical treatment.

It is believed to be the second helicopter to have been shot at in Jonglei this week.

On Friday, a UN helicopter trying to evacuate peacekeepers and civilians in the state was fired on, causing 'significant' damage, according to two US officials.Â 

Coup: The conflict started last Sunday when troops loyal to former Vice President Machar opened fired at a government meeting in an attempted coup. Above, Sudan People's Liberation Army soldiers are pictured driving a truck through Juba on December 21

Fighting each other: President Obama said in a statement earlier this week that South Sudan 'stands on the precipice' of civil war. Above, SPLA soldiers in Juba on Satuday

Rob McKee, of Warrior Security, said the aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing after suffering small arms fire while trying to evacuate personnel from a base in Yuai.

A second official - who wishes to remain unnamed - said the helicopter was abandoned and remains unable to fly.

However, no injuries have so far been reported.

Next steps: President Obama is currently considering taking more military action in the country

South Sudan has seen some of the its worst ever violence over the past week - claiming at least 500 lives so far.

The U.S. military dispatched 46 troops to protect its embassy in the capital of Juba, while the State Department has warned American citizens in the country to leave immediately.

Hundreds of people are believed to be trapped in Bor, which is currently in hands of rebels.

Meanwhile, thousands of others have fled to UN compounds to seek shelter from the violence.

The conflict began on Sunday when troops loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar allegedly opened fire at a government meeting in an attempt to force President Salva Kiir from power.

Machar was sacked along with the entire rest of the cabinet in July after announcing he was going to contest the 2015 general election.

Yesterday, President Barack Obama said the country 'stands on the precipice' of civil war as conflict in the country entered its sixth day.

In a statement, he said: 'In 2011, millions of South Sudanese voted to forge a new nation, founded on the promise of a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of South Sudan's people.

'In recent years, against great odds, South Sudan has made great progress toward breaking the cycle of violence that characterized much of its history.

'Today, that future is at risk. South Sudan stands at the precipice. Recent fighting threatens to plunge South Sudan back into the dark days of its past.'

A number of other nations, including Britain, have sent in military troops to rescue their civilians.
