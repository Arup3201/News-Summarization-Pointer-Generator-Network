It's enough to make Margaret Thatcher proud.

Enterprising Tory activists are selling off a bizarre range of branded merchandise in a bid to bolster the party's election war chest.

With mugs, baby grows, golf balls, stress balls and lager mocking Ed Balls, it seems there is almost no item which cannot be plastered with the party logo and sold for profit - by no means a dirty word at the Tory conference in Birmingham.

Next generation: Baby bibs are available for £8, with Little Iron Lady or Team 2030, a reference to the campaign movement Team 2015 which could prove key to Tory success at the next election

Bottles of Our Maggie beer are on sale from the official Tory party merchandise stand

Oystercard holders are available for £2 with a famous Margaret Thatcher quote (left), while there are even Conservative party cupcakes, costing £6, which are basically just blue cupcake cases with a Conservative sticker on the lid

Golf balls with the Conservatives name and tree logo are available for keen putter, costing £5

With Chancellor George Osborne placing a heavy emphasis on managing the nation's finances, activists are encouraged to buy a piggy bank in Tory blue, but they will set you back £3

Party members are queuing up to buy the bizarre range of items on stale in the International Convention Centre

The merchandise is being snapped up on the official party stand in the International Convention Centre.

Much of it is patriotic stuff, paying tribute to Margaret Thatcher in particular, with quotes and photographs of the Iron Lady emblazoned across a range of plastic items.

There are Oyster travelcard holders featuring her famous quote: 'You may have to fight a battle more than once to win it.'

The former Prime Minister also features on bottles of Our Maggie beer, and there are even baby's bibs with 'Little Iron Lady' written in bright pink.

The Labour Isn't Working mug is the biggest seller on the official Conservative Party Archive stall, costing £5.95

A print of the iconic Tory party poster, used in the 1979 general election campaign, signed by Margaret Thatcher is on sale for £2,000

Fridge magnets featuring posters of Winston Churchill and even Lloyd George are among the items

The Conservative logo seems to have been slapped on just about any object the merchandising team could think of: Mugs, pens, golf balls and even stress balls, which the stallholders joke are 'particularly useful when listening to an Ed Balls speech'.

But the enterprising team might have overstretched themselves with attempts to cash in on the popularity of the Great British Bake Off.

Conservative party cupcake cases are on sale, but aside from a sticker on the lid, they are essentially just blue cupcakes. 

Ed Miliband is the butt of several parody items distributed by the Conservative party machine, including Mililight beer, with a label reading 'weak flavour, weak leader... hard to swallow'

Beer mats handed out from the Tax And Spend mock pub features a devastating quote from the Labour leader when he denied the last government had spent too much money

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls is also ridiculed, with PringBalls crisps suggesting that once he starts spending he just can't stop, and Ballsberg lager, with the slogan: Probably not the best economist in the world'

 Labour's leadership, and Ed Miliband in particular, are also mocked a great deal. 

There is a book of Ed Miliband's Policies for Britain, in which all of the pages are blank.

And a range of beers were on offer from a mock pub called the Tax and Spend. They include Mililight beer, with a label reading 'weak flavour, weak leader... hard to swallow'

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls is also ridiculed, with PringBalls crisps suggesting that once he starts spending he just can't stop, and Balsberg lager, with the slogan: Probably not the best economist in the world'.

There are mugs, pens and even stress balls, which stallholders say are 'particularly useful when listening to an Ed Balls speech'

Delegates are also urged to write on posters what they like and admire about David Cameron

Hundreds of blue badges feature the conference slogan: 'Let's secure a better future'

At the stand of the Conservative Party Archive, the biggest selling items are mugs featuring the iconic 1979 poster warning: 'Labour Isn't Working'.

A rare print of the poster, signed by Margaret Thatcher is one sale for £2,000.

A less well-known poster from 1992, warning of Labour's Double Whammy, has been signed by John Major and is available for £495.
