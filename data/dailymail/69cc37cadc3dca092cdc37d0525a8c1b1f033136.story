Thrifty: Martin Lewis, pictured with his wife Lara Lewington, faced a backlash from subscribers after the deal was announced

A few years ago he was wooing his future wife over restaurant meals funded by discount vouchers.

Yesterday Martin Lewis, the consumer champion behind the website MoneySavingExpert.com, sold it for £87million.

The 40-year-old personal finance journalist and TV pundit, who started the site in 2003 at a cost of just £100, agreed the deal with the price comparison website MoneySupermarket.

He faced a furious backlash from some of the 7million subscribers to his weekly email, who accused him of being a ‘sell-out’ and suggested the site would lose the independence on which he built its  phenomenal success.

One commentator named Sablade wrote on his forum: ‘A very sad day for your unbiased opinions – a sell out! We now need a new unbiased independent website.’

Another suggested that the site would ‘only promote companies that pay them’, while a third added: ‘Even if the site remained completely true to its founding principles, the commercial link will destroy people’s perception of independence and fairness. The site, however honest it may be, will not be trusted.’

Mr Lewis said he chose MoneySupermarket because it is not owned by any product providers and had signed up to an editorial code which ensures the website’s content will be free from commercial pressures.

He added: ‘MoneySavingExpert.com has become part of people’s daily lives, far  bigger than the man who founded it, and now is the right time for it to stand on its own two feet.’

He will stay as editor-in-chief for three years, with the help of MoneySupermarket’s resources and the website’s existing 42-strong staff.

‘After that, the door is open for me to carry on, and I hope to do so, though perhaps with fewer hours than now, so I can spend more time on my media work and other projects I’m passionate about,’ he said. ‘These include getting financial education on the curriculum.’

Mr Lewis will receive £60million upfront in a mixture of cash and shares and a further £27million conditional on meeting targets over the next three years.

He says he plans to donate £10million to charity from the deal, which needs the approval of MoneySupermarket shareholders.

Success: Mr Lewis will remain as editor-in-chief of the website for three years

The
 son of a headmaster, Mr Lewis studied law at the London School of 
Economics and briefly worked as a spin doctor for City companies before 
training as a journalist.

He
 worked at Radio 4’s Today programme before starting his site in 
February 2003. He makes regular TV appearances talking about personal 
finance matters on ITV’s Daybreak programme, as well as the BBC’s 
Watchdog.

Nicknamed ‘the 
tightest man in Britain’ because of his penny-pinching obsession, Mr 
Lewis has admitted that when he first started going out with weather 
girl Lara Lewington, he impressed her by haggling with a John Lewis 
salesman to get free bulbs for the lamp he was buying.

Huge windfall: Martin Lewis has sold his website MoneySavingExpert for £87million. He created the website for just £100 nine years ago

He
 also refused to eat in restaurants with her if he did not have a 
discount voucher. They married in 2009 and live in north-west London. 
Yesterday he revealed his 33-year-old wife is pregnant with their first 
child.

Mr Lewis has always insisted that he has nothing against spending money, but just hates being overcharged.

He explained in an interview: ‘I have a big problem with value. I like value, I’m not tight.’

Mr
 Lewis told Radio 5 Live: ‘While I may have sold the website, I’m not 
sold out. We still will be telling people what’s best for them based on 
editorial judgment not commercial factors. There’s no change to what’s 
happened on the website.’

He
 added: ‘It does leave me a wealthy man. Right now it’s all a bit of a 
daze.’ He said despite his fortune he will be still using discount 
vouchers and does not intend to switch his Smart car for  a flashier 
vehicle.

‘I’m as tight as I’ve ever been and will continue to be so.’

The company buying Mr Lewis’s brainchild is Britain’s oldest and biggest comparison website.MoneySupermarket.com has grown steadily since it was founded in 1999, and last year its pre-tax profits jumped by over a fifth to £49.5million.

The site claims to have a registered database of ten million active users. As well as competing heavily in the car insurance market with Confused.com, GoCompare.com and Comparethemarket.com, it compares home and travel insurance, bank loans and credit cards.

Last month Which? found that like other aggregators it often only searches a small amount of the market when offering best deals. For home insurance, Moneysupermarket searches 33 per cent of the total market – although this is still far higher than some of its rivals.

Insurer Direct Line has launched an advertising campaign attacking aggregators for giving the impression of a full comparison.

Direct Line, as the name suggests, deals only directly with consumers and is not included in these comparisons.

Moneysupermarket has also been criticised in the past for pushing advertisers ahead of best buys on some products, most notably loans and credit cards which are the most profitable.
