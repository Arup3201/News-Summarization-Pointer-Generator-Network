Defense attorneys are set to strongly suggest that the real killers of a toddler brutally shot to death in his stroller were his parents, who had a financial interest in his death - and that their 18-year-old defendant who goes on trial this week is not guilty.

Antonio Santiago had learned to walk, but not yet talk, when he was killed March 21, six weeks after his first birthday.

He was strapped in his stroller, out for a walk with his mother a few blocks from their apartment near the Georgia coast, when someone shot the boy between the eyes with a .22-caliber bullet the size of a garden pea.

Murdered: Baby Antonio was shot in the head as he slept by two boys who attempted to rob his mother

De'Marquise Elkin, 18, who has been 
charged as the shooter, is scheduled to stand trial next week in a 
courthouse far from the scene of the crime.

Kevin
 Gough, a public defender who is Elkins' lead attorney, has strongly 
suggested in pretrial motions that the real killers are the child's own 
parents.

‘Other 
evidence of record suggests Sherry West is mentally unstable, gave 
several inconsistent accounts of how the crime transpired, and had a 
financial interest in the death of her son in the form of an insurance 
policy,’ Gough said in a court motion filed August 5.

Defense
 attorneys have said in court filings they have audio recordings and 
documents showing the child's mother had dealings with Gerber Life 
Insurance Co.

According
 to its website, Gerber Life sells life insurance policies for children 
starting as early as infancy. Coverage runs from $5,000 to $50,000.

Ashley
 Glassey, West's 21-year-old daughter, told television station WTLV of 
Jacksonville, Florida, soon after the shooting that her mother called 
her after Antonio was killed and asked, ‘How soon do you think the life 
insurance policy will send me a check?’

One
 of Elkins' lawyers interviewed Glassey July 30 in Woodstown, New 
Jersey, where she was in jail for failing to appear in court in an 
unrelated case.

According to a transcript, Glassey declined to confirm the story, only saying that she does not want ‘to incriminate anyone.’

Because
 of public outrage and news coverage, a judge has moved Elkins' trial 325 
miles away, to the suburbs outside Atlanta. Jury selection starts Monday
 at the Cobb County courthouse in Marietta. Superior Court Judge Stephen
 Kelley has set aside two weeks for the trial.

Conspiracy: The defense has suggested that the baby's parents killed him to collect his life insurance

Incriminating: West's 21-year-old daughter told a TV 
station that her mother called her after Antonio's murder wondering how 
long it would take to receive a check from the life insurance company

Elkins
 faces life in prison if convicted of murder. His youth spared him a 
possible death sentence. At the time of the shooting he was 17, too 
young to face capital charges in Georgia.

Investigators
 concluded that Antonio was killed during an attempted street robbery as
 his mother, Sherry West, was strolling home with the child from the 
post office.

Miss West said a gunman demanding cash shot her baby in the face after she told him she had no money.

‘He
 kept asking, and I just said “I don't have it,"’ West told The 
Associated Press the day after the slaying. ‘And he said, “Do you want 
me to kill your baby?” And I said, “No, don't kill my baby!”’

West
 was shot in the leg, and another bullet grazed her ear. Witnesses 
called 911 and rushed to her aid. None saw the shooting, but they 
watched as West tried to revive her son using CPR.

‘No, the baby's not breathing,’ one caller told a 911 operator.

Police said Elkins had an accomplice, 15-year-old Dominique Lang, who has told investigators Elkins fired the gun.

Lang also is charged with murder but will be tried later. He's expected to be a key witness against Elkins.

Spared: Because of his youth, Elkins will not be facing capital punishment, if convicted

Evidence: Lab tests found traces of gunshot residue on swabs taken from the hands of West (left) and the boy's father, Louis Santiago (right)

The 15-year-old was in the eighth grade at Glynn Middle School before his arrest, said Jim Weidhaas, a school spokesman.

Elkins was last a student in the 
system in October 2011 when he left Ombudsman, an outsourced alternative
 school program, Weidhaas said.

Both
 prosecutors and Elkins' defense attorneys declined to comment before 
the trial, citing a gag order by the judge. The boy's mother also 
declined to talk.

In 2008, West's 18-year-old son was 
stabbed to death in an altercation in New Jersey. Prosecutors said the 
stabbing was self-defense and did not file charges.

History of violence: Prosecutors said Elkins shot somebody else 10 days before the toddler was killed

Family: Elkins' mother and sister provided information that led police to a pond where they found a .22 caliber revolver

Defense
 attorneys also pointed to lab tests by the Georgia Bureau of 
Investigation that found traces of gunshot residue on swabs taken from 
the hands of West and the boy's father, Louis Santiago.

Reports
 filed in court stated the GBI found a single microscopic particle of 
gunshot residue swabbed from the father's hands, while more than five 
particles showed up in swabs from West's hands.

The
 GBI report cautioned that gunshot victims can end up with residue on 
them. During a preliminary court hearing, Santiago said he touched the 
bullet wound on West's leg before his hands were swabbed.

In
 a court filing Wednesday, District Attorney Jackie Johnson argued that 
Elkins' defense lawyers have made ‘false, inflammatory and misleading 
statements’ about the case.

While
 the toddler's mother identified Elkins as the shooter in a photo 
lineup, police said much of their evidence against the teenager came 
from his own family and the younger teen charged as his accomplice.

Horror: Demarquis Elkins, 17, allegedly threatened Sherry West then shot her infant son when she didn't give him any money

Investigators
 have testified that Lang told police he and Elkins were trying to rob a
 woman pushing a baby in a stroller when Elkins pulled a gun and shot 
them both.

Lang's aunt,
 Debra Obey, told police her nephew and Elkins came to her for a ride 
the day of the slaying. She said Elkins ducked down in the back seat of 
her car, as if he was hiding.

Four
 days after the shooting, police said information from Elkins' mother 
and sister helped lead investigators to a pond where they found a 
.22-caliber revolver.

Both
 women were charged with evidence tampering. Elkins' mother, Karimah 
Elkins, also was charged with lying to police. Prosecutors say Elkins' 
mother and an aunt gave police conflicting alibis for his whereabouts at
 the time of the shooting. Karimah Elkins is scheduled to stand trial 
alongside her son.

Meanwhile, prosecutors said Elkins shot somebody else 10 days before the toddler was killed. Wilfredo
 Calix Flores has identified Elkins as the man who shot him in the arm 
during an attempted stickup March 11. Police said Flores was shot with a
 .22-caliber bullet.

The judge has ruled that jurors can hear about a statement police say Elkins made the day after the killing.

Police
 investigator Roderic Nohilly testified at a pretrial hearing that he 
and officer Cody Blades were escorting a handcuffed Elkins when the 
suspect said, ‘Y'all ain't got no gun. Y'all ain't got no fingerprints.’
 He then referenced an acquittal.

The investigator said Blades just smiled at Elkins, who responded: ‘Oh, y'all got the gun?’
