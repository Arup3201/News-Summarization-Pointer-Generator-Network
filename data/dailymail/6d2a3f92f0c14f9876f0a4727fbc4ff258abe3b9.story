A twice suspended doctor banned for prescribing the wrong drugs and carrying out unauthorised operations is back at work.

London GP Arun Raunier also failed basic exams but to the fury of former patients has been allowed back into medicine by the General Medical Council (GMC).

Rauniar was suspended in 2008 and then again in 2010 after it was found he had not improved as a doctor.

Originally he had performed ‘inappropriate’ operations, including circumcision, at his Leyton surgery in east London while also falsely claiming to be a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.

Dr Rauniar had also failed to assess and examine patients properly, held out-of date emergency drugs and believed it was not his job to deal with mental health issues.

90-year-old mother Lydia Sandford was prescribed drugs used to treat dementia patients by the bungling GP, but in fact had suffered a mini stroke.

Her son Geoff Sandford made a formal complaint against Rainiar claiming his actions sped up her death and he has maintained for a decade that he should have been struck off for what he did to his mother.

‘It’s absolutely outrageous,’ he told The Sun.

‘This man is a liar and a danger to patients. The GMC attitude seems to be that he hasn’t killed anyone.’

The Sun claim that he is now back at work under supervision at a different east London surgery.

Back in April 2008 he was found guilty of multiple failings by the GMC.

At that hearing he was ordered to retrain and blocked from practising without supervision for two years.

In the same year he was asked to sit medical exams testing his judgement and problem solving.

But he fell short, scoring 381 points when he needed 480 to pass.

Two years later the GMC said he had made no progress and suspended him for again for a further 12 months.

A new GMC panel considered his case last month and has said that as long as he shows he has improved as a doctor they will allow him to take a new GP’s job in the UK.

Chairman Dr Robin Knill-Jones said: ‘The Panel considers that a period of three years will be needed for you to address your retraining issues and give you sufficient time to prepare for and undergo a further performance reassessment, before your case is reviewed.

‘The Panel is encouraged by your efforts and now expect you to embark on a more formal approach to your retraining.’
