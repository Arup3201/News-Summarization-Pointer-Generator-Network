More Americans than not believe that harsh interrogation tactics used by the CIA during the Bush administration were 'justified' and produced worthwhile intelligence, even if they were 'torture,' a poll released today shows.

Survey-takers discovered that a plurality of interviewees believe the brutal interrogations were justified, 49 percent, and resulted in reliable intelligence, 57 percent.

But even while giving the CIA their blessing to forcefully question suspected terrorists, nearly seven in 10 in Americans said they consider waterboarding - one of the 13 approved Bush-era techniques - to be 'torture,' a CBS News poll found.

Pluralities of Americans believe that enhanced interrogation techniques used by the George W. Bush administration's CIA were both 'justified' and worthwhile 

A majority also said that threatening to sexually assault detainees' mothers equaled torture, 73 percent, as were the forced ice water baths they were given, 57 percent, and the sleep deprivation they were subjected to, 70 percent.

Republicans were most likely to approve of the program that was carried out in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks during Republican president George W. Bush's tenure, 75 percent, followed by Democrats, 54 percent, and independent voters, 50 percent.

Similarly, Republicans were least likely to say that waterboarding constitutes torture and that terrorism suspects should have the same rights as other suspected criminals.

Legal rights for detainees with known terrorist ties was not popular with respondents of any political persuasion, however, and 56 percent of all Americans questioned said they were not in favor of such a measure. 

A second survey performed by Pew Research Center revealed similar attitudes among Americans.

That poll found that 51 percent backed the CIA's use of the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques compared to the 29 percent who said they were 'not justified.' A fifth of those polled said they did not know what to think.

The same survey discovered that 56 percent of Americans believe that the aggressive treatment led terrorism suspects to provide 'intelligence that prevented terrorist attacks.'

Likewise, 28 percent said they agreed with a Senate report released that claims it did not, and 16 percent said said they were unsure.

And as in the CBS poll, those surveyed were more likely to be in favor of the CIA program if they self-identified as Republican, 76 percent, than were Democrats, 37 percent, or independents, 49 percent. 

Republicans were more likely than Democrats or independents to say that the measures were justified and helped to prevent future terrorist attacks

Respondents to the Pew poll were split over whether the Senate should have released a declassified, 600-page version review of the CIA program at all, with 42 percent saying they were for it and 43 percent saying they were against it. 

Perhaps more revealing was the percentage of Americans who told Pew that they kept a close eye on the national debate following the Tuesday release of the Senate document at all: 23 percent.

The report took a back seat, Pew discovered, to news on the monthly jobs numbers and on protests against police brutality.
