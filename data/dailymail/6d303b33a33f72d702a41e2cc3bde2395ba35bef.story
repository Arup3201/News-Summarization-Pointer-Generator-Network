If you were hoping for a sun-kissed last weekend before heading back to work, then you’re in luck.

Britain will be basking in temperatures of up to 27c (81f) on Saturday and 28c (82f) on Sunday - in what is expected to be the last weekend of a summer which some would say has never even arrived.

Conditions will turn almost immediately on Monday when many Britons return to the office, as temperatures plunge back to the high teens, accompanied by showers and breezes.

This weekend will follow a warm 
and dry week for most parts, which will continue today with sunny 
periods lasting longest across East Anglia, southern parts of the 
Midlands and southern counties.

Children back at school were unable 
to enjoy the warm weather today, but that didn't stop thousands of 
people heading to the beach.

'We’ve had such a wet summer and I was not going to miss the opportunity to get on the beach when the sun finally showed. I feel sorry for my son Jack, and my husband whose at work, but Martha and I are having a wonderful time together'

Louise Smith, 29, from Wimborne, 
Dorset, was on the beach in Bournemouth with her daughter Martha, three,
but said her son had returned to the classroom this week, so he was missing 
out.

She said: ‘We’ve had such a wet 
summer and I was not going to miss the opportunity to get on the beach 
when the sun finally showed.

’I feel sorry for my son Jack, and my husband who's at work, but Martha and I are having a wonderful time together.

‘The water is perfectly clear and 
surprisingly warm and we are having a brilliant time. It’s just a shame 
it wasn’t like this during the holidays.’

Sunseekers today gathered on the 
beach in Bournemouth, Dorset, while many walked along the promenade and 
Victorian pier. Ice cream vendors meanwhile enjoyed a super seasonal 
finale.

Ice cream salesman Phil Baker said: ‘It’s been really busy today considering the schools have gone back.

‘There
have been lots of mums with very young children and quite a lot of 
pensioners are out and about. Because the sun is shining they’ve all 
been buying ice creams.

‘But
it won’t make up for the poor trade through the summer. There were days
when I didn’t sell a single ice cream, but hopefully this weekend will 
be busy.’

Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said the upcoming warm weekend is ‘a bit of a bonus for mid-September’.

He told MailOnline:
‘It’s well above average for this time of year. The best of the weather
this weekend is going to be in the southern half of the UK on Saturday,
but many eastern areas will also do OK.

‘Any
rain will be probably confined to north-west Scotland, with 
temperatures quite widely in the twenties from the Aberdeenshire area 
all the way down to London.’

However
the warm temperatures over the weekend will be accompanied by 
single-figure lows overnight in some areas, and a fast turnaround into 
more normal September weather by next week.

Mr
Keates added: ‘I think by Monday into Tuesday, we're back to what we're
more used to in September - much cooler, showers and quite breezy - but
in itself, nothing unusual.

‘There are no signs over the next few weeks of anything exceptionally warm developing again. We're back to a changeable situation, with temperatures in the high teens, maybe into the twenties.

‘By Monday there will be more persistent rain in north Scotland and next week it will be quite a lot more unsettled - something for everyone.’

Hot and cold: The south of England will experience the best weather this weekend, although northern parts should also do well on Saturday - while much of the country will experience showers by Monday

The warm weather is expected to spread 
across all of Britain on Saturday, with the exception of north-west 
Scotland, but by Sunday it will be more confined to central and eastern 
parts.

'It’s well above average for this time of year. The best of the weather this weekend is going to be in the southern half of the UK on Saturday, but many eastern areas will also do OK'

Steven Keates, Met Office

Mr Keates told MailOnline: ‘It could well feel a little more humid by Sunday and it does bring the risk of the odd shower in south-west England. At the moment most places will probably stay dry on Sunday.’

Tonight the weather is expected to stay generally cloudy across north-west England and western Scotland, with further patchy light rain expected.

It will be predominantly dry across the rest of the UK with clear periods, although mist and fog will develop quite widely as the night progresses and it will feel chilly in southern areas.

On the up: Ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years

The demand for ice cream is slowly melting away as consumers are put off by high prices and switching to the more healthy option of frozen yoghurt, which is enjoying soaring sales.

Analysts say Britons will eat 27million fewer litres of ice cream this year than in 2007, down 7 per cent, and spiralling prices mean the slide will continue over the next five years by another 7 per cent.

Retail experts Mintel suggest total annual ice cream consumption will fall from 374million litres to 324million in the decade from 2007, meaning we will eat at least 500million fewer scoops a year.

Mintel also reported that ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years as the prices of sugar and other raw materials have risen. Higher manufacturing and transport costs have also had an impact, despite heavy advertising and promotion.

Amy Price, Mintel’s senior food analyst, said: ‘Almost a fifth of consumers are cutting back because of financial or health reasons. Together with the pressure on consumer incomes, this has gone some way to dampening demand.’
