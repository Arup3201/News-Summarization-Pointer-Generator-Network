Nick Clegg last night joined the chorus of demands to strip disgraced banker Sir Fred Goodwin of his knighthood.

The Deputy Prime Minister’s intervention means all three main party leaders have now backed a review of the honour for the ex-Royal Bank of  Scotland chief.

Whitehall’s Forfeiture Committee is to consider whether to ask the Queen to revoke Sir Fred’s knighthood, which was bestowed on him in 2004 for ‘services to banking’.

Under fire: Calls for Sir Fred Goodwin, seen here with his wife Lady Joyce, to lose his knighthood have intensified with Clegg backing Miliband's opinion

The Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘Honours should be deserved and awarded to unique people who have made Britain a better place.

‘I sympathise with those who think it a travesty for a man who did so 
much damage to the British economy and made so much money in the process
to retain his knighthood.

‘I understand the outrage and there is an independent process that deals
with revoking honours – they must be left to make their own decision on
this.’ 

Mr Cameron has said the Forfeiture Committee should take into 
account a damning report into the collapse of RBS by the Financial 
Services Authority last month.

Ed Miliband, left,  has backed calls for Sir Fred to have his knighthood removed while David Cameron, right, is sympathetic to the calls too and revealed a secret Whitehall body is to consider revoking the title

It said poor decisions by Sir Fred were a major factor in the crisis 
that led to RBS being bailed out with £45billion of taxpayers’ money. 
Meanwhile, Tory MP Matthew Hancock has tabled a series of questions over
the granting of Sir Fred’s honour.

Mr Hancock is demanding all correspondence between Treasury officials, 
ministers and special advisers relating to the honours list of 2004. 
Gordon Brown, who was Chancellor that year, is said to have backed Sir 
Fred’s award, but it emerged yesterday that the Scottish government then
led by Jack McConnell, now a Labour peer, pushed Sir Fred’s nomination.

Mr Hancock has tabled a Commons motion arguing it was ‘perverse and unacceptable’ that Sir Fred should keep the knighthood.

Conservative Party chairman Baroness Warsi and Labour’s shadow education
secretary Stephen Twigg also backed calls for the knighthood to be 
forfeited.

The Treasury, as the department which recommended the RBS chief, pictured in 2009, for the award in 2004, is expected to set out reasons for its removal to the Forfeiture Committee

But Lord McConnell insisted Sir Fred was not the only person to blame 
for the collapse of RBS. He said: ‘I think the reasons for what happened
at the banks are more complex than just one person.

‘Fred Goodwin made mistakes, but so did a lot of other people at RBS, 
including people on the board who also have honours. They appointed him 
and agreed the strategy and have never been held to account.

‘I think the Government, both the Labour and Tory government before it, were making mistakes about regulation.

‘I sympathise with the public concern on this issue but I think if you 
are going to have a system that is relatively independent and fair in 
allocating these awards then you need to have a system that is 
independent and fair in looking at removing them.’

Arrogance: Sir Fred Goodwin who was removed from his job in 2008

The only surprise about the clamour to strip Sir Fred Goodwin of his knighthood is that it has taken so long.

It was all the way back in October 2008, in the tumultuous days following the crash of Lehman Brothers, that he was unceremoniously removed from his job as chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

RBS had all but collapsed and was nationalised at a cost to taxpayers of £48billion. But, even in those final hours, he negotiated himself an astonishing pensions package originally worth £16million, or £693,000 a year for the rest of his life.

Heading for the lifeboat first, as the ship was listing, was an act of selfishness and hubris seldom matched in British public life. The disaster at RBS immeasurably damaged this nation and all who live in it.

It has tainted banking and the financial system, one of the great pillars of Britain’s modern prosperity, and massacred the reputation of all bankers. Far more seriously, it has destroyed life savings, and helped condemn the nation to slow growth and surging unemployment.

And at the heart of this catastrophe was Goodwin, a man who had a swagger and an arrogance unmatched in a financial world not short of egos.

His mad drive to turn RBS into the world’s largest bank drove him to trample over all those in his way as he indulged in a frenzy of reckless lending.

The consequences of his appalling misjudgments are being felt today, and will be for years to come.The bank abandoned all pretence of traditional Scottish prudence and lent to anyone who knocked on the door. Among those able to borrow money was the ambitious entrepreneur Richard Kirk, who needed money to buy the high street shopping chain Peacock’s.

When RBS pulled the plug on the company this week, 10,000 jobs were placed at risk, adding to the tens of thousands already lost at RBS.

Goodwin came to believe he was better than anyone else at what he did.

There is no greater testimony to his overweening vanity than RBS’s monstrous ‘World Headquarters’, built on a greenfield site at Gogarburn on the outskirts of Edinburgh. This folly was designed to please the chief executive, and hang the shareholders and customers.

Secure in his palatial headquarters, he organised his surroundings, including the kitchens, allegedly so that scallops, a favourite dish, could arrive at his desk while at their moist best.

There was a private aircraft, RBS1, a fleet of BMW limousines stamped through with the RBS logo and a suite at the Savoy for his London visits.

Most disgracefully of all, Goodwin felt so above the rules that governed the lives of ordinary RBS employees and staff in other large organisations that he felt able to conduct an extramarital affair with a senior female colleague. He then hid behind a court injunction until he was found out.

Goodwin’s willingness to use the law to hide his egregious behaviour has become notorious. When a Sunday Times diarist reported on the supposed scallops kitchen he sued for libel. More recently, he hired lawyers to sanitise the investigation by the Financial Services Authority into the firm’s collapse.

As a result, Goodwin receives only a handful of mentions in the report. What does come through loud and clear is his hectoring and bullying, which made colleagues too scared to challenge him.

At the height of his reign, in the summer of 2008, after he had wasted £49billion of shareholders’ money buying the badly-run Dutch bank ABN Amro, I visited him for lunch.

When I questioned the wisdom of buying a bank in the middle of a credit meltdown, he forcefully defended his actions. It was ignorant and dangerous bravado. The deal must rank as one of the greatest derelictions of duty by a chief executive in modern times.His knighthood – arranged by Gordon Brown in 2004 – makes a laughing stock of all those deserving of the honour.

It also casts a terrible pall over the honours system and cocks a snook at all those suffering because of Goodwin’s mistakes.

His is a case so exceptional the Queen, on the recommendation of government, should not hesitate to remove this blot on the business world.

To do so would show the world what moral capitalism actually means, and perhaps even give the banking system the fresh start it craves.

Defiant: Stephen Hester who the Prime Minister said should not receive 'a penny in bonus'

David Cameron vowed to block a £1million bonus for the boss of a failed bank rescued by the taxpayer yesterday.

The Prime Minister’s war on excessive executive pay comes as critics said Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester should not receive ‘a penny in bonus’.

Mr Hester, 51, is said to be in line to enjoy a £1.5million windfall despite the fact that the bank’s share price has halved over the last year.

Asked if he would act to stop the bosses of state-owned banks receiving £1million bonuses, Mr Cameron replied: ‘The short answer is yes.’

The Prime Minister announced that the Government would cap cash bonuses in the two state-owned banks – RBS and Lloyds TSB – at £2,000 for all employees and would use its clout as major shareholder to limit the amount in shares paid to senior executives. No 10 sources said the Prime Minister is ‘determined to act’ and would assure that there was no repeat of the ‘absurd’ bonus paid to Mr Hester last year, which topped £2million.

Yesterday experts expressed fury that Mr Hester could be weeks away from a bonus while the rest of the country suffers an income squeeze.

Sources say Mr Hester is adamant he deserves his bonus for his role at the helm of the disgraced bank, which was kept afloat with £45billion of taxpayers’ money. But Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, insisted rumours that a £1.5million bonus has been agreed are ‘inaccurate and premature.’

He said: ‘Neither the remuneration committee nor the board has discussed the position on the bonus for our chief executive for 2011 at this stage. Any suggestion to the contrary is therefore untrue.’

The timing is particularly awkward because Business Secretary Vince Cable will on Tuesday reveal his plans for curbing executive pay.
