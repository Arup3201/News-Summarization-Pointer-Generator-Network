They say that dogs are a man's best friend.

But one pooch proved how much he cared for his own kind when he rescued a canine pal after she fell down a rabbit hole and become trapped for over a day.

Bear, the Patterdale terrier saved the day after next door neighbour and mother to his five pups, Doodle, went missing after venturing out on August 14.

Delia Robinson from Statton Strawless, near Norwich, was devastated when her beloved dog didn't return home after going out looking for rabbits.

Mrs Robinson searched the woods behind her home with friends and family before calling on the RSPCA and fellow villagers to help in the search to find Doodle.

Despite their best efforts, no one could find her.

Hope was running out when it occurred to Mrs Robinson that Bear, her neighbour's pet and father to Doodle's puppies, may be able to sniff her out.

Once back in the woodland it took Bear mere moments to track down his canine pal who had been underground for 36 hours.

Having been dragged to the spot where Doodle was trapped, Mrs Robinson put her ear to the ground and could just about hear the dog's frightened whimpering two feet below.

'Well I thought it was her but it was so faint,' she said.

'Doodle could hardly bark because she had lost her voice, but I was over the moon to hear it.

She was so deep down I thought "how am I going to get her out, I'm going to need more than a spade - I'll need a mechanical digger or something."'

Bear was rewarded by Mr and Mrs Robinson with a big juicy steak. He and Doodle (right) have five puppies together.

Mrs Robinson and her husband, David, dug with spades for 30 minutes until they reached her.

Overjoyed, she pulled the exhausted terrier out of the hole. Her rescuer, Bear, was just as excited to see her safe and well.

'Doodle is recovering well from her ordeal, although her voice is still suffering from all the barking she did down there.

'We're just so glad to get her home in one piece - thanks to Bear.

'He's a true hero. Doodle would have died if he hadn't found her because I don't think we would have been able to.'

Mr and Mrs Robinson have since bought Bear a big, juicy steak to say thank you.
