Former Manchester United right-back Gary Neville is 'concerned' Louis van Gaal's stuttering side will fall behind Liverpool in the race for Champions League qualification.

The race for a top four finish in the Premier League is extremely tight as only four points separate Arsenal in third and Tottenham placed in seventh.

Liverpool have been in fine form recently and haven't lost in the Premier League since a 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford on December 14, whereas Manchester United lost 2-1 at Swansea on Saturday.

'I still think United will get into the top four but I am more concerned than I was a few weeks ago, particularly with Liverpool as they've come into a run of form where they are keeping clean sheets, they are playing a lot better,' Neville told talkSPORT.

'I wasn't as concerned three or four weeks ago as they were around eight points behind and I thought with the Europa League commitments that would be too much for them. Now Liverpool are within a short distance of United I am concerned.'

Fellow Sky pundit and Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher now backs Brendan Rodgers' side to reach the prestigious top four:

'I said for the last few weeks I didn't think Liverpool would get top four because of FA Cup and Europe commitments,' said Carragher.

'I did also say I thought United would reach the top four but I don't know if their bad form people are talking about is just how United play at the moment under Louis van Gaal.'

Carragher added: 'They've been on a great run but the fact that Liverpool have been coming into great form, a lot will be decided on the game at Anfield (March 22) and I'd have to fancy Liverpool on current form. Whether the accumulation of games will be a factor for Liverpool who knows.'
