Young mother: Janine Mallett was discovered on Saturday morning by the main beach of San Antonio, Ibiza

A young mother apparently drowned after going for a midnight swim during an evening out on the holiday island of Ibiza.

Janine Mallett, 31, was found in the sea early on Saturday after becoming separated from her friend while celebrating in the party resort of San Antonio.

She was pronounced dead and police immediately launched an investigation.

But last night they were understood to have ruled out ‘foul play’ and believe she may have died in a tragic accident.

Spanish police are investigating whether Mrs Mallett may have decided to go for a midnight swim in the sea after spending the evening in bars in the resort.

Tests are also being carried out to see whether she suffered a heart attack and drowned.

Mrs Mallett lived in Stockton-on-Tees with her husband, Iain, an electrician, and her two children, a boy, aged three, and a girl, aged six.

Last night Mr Mallett, 30, was being comforted by friends and family and was too upset to speak at their home in the town.

But her mother, Colleen Hadfield, 62, said: ‘She was the most lovely person. She was beautiful. We are just waiting to see when we can bring her home.’ 

Her brother, Adam, 27, and sister, Gemma, 29, are said to be beside themselves with grief over the tragedy.

Neighbour Pauline Kelsey, 61, who lives two doors down said: ‘I have known Iain and his family since he was a kid. Janine has got two children - a boy and a girl.

‘They are beautiful. She would do anything for anyone. She is beautiful, she has always been really nice. There is nothing you can say, is there. It is total devastation.’

She said: ‘They are a young family - I can’t believe it. She would help anybody, she was that kind of young lady. She was always very smart.’

Her husband Bob Kelsey, 63, a professional driver, said: ‘You couldn’t ask for better neighbours. We are totally shocked. She is only a young girl. You don’t expect things like this.’

An autopsy was due to be carried out on her body last night to determine the cause of death.

A female friend of married Janine, who had flown to Ibiza with her on Thursday, has told police she lost sight of her during the night while they were out partying.

Her body was discovered on Saturday morning just before 11am off S’Arenal beach, the main beach of party resort San Antonio.

A source said: ‘Janine was with a female friend. They went out and got separated from each other and the friend went back to the hotel alone just before 1am on Saturday morning with no idea where Janine was.

‘They hadn’t spoken about going swimming as far as I know so it’s a mystery as to how Janine’s body came to be in the sea. The friend is obviously devastated.’

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said ‘We can confirm the death of a British national in Ibiza .We are offering consular assistance to the family.’
