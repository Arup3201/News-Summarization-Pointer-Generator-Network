Manchester United will see if Sporting Lisbon have any interest in taking midfielder Anderson in the deal for Marcos Rojo.

Nani is a target for Sporting but the player has been reluctant to go back to Portugal and was holding out for clubs in Italy and Spain to firm up their interest. 

United have prioritised Rojo as coach Louis van Gaal is eager for a left-sided centre-back who can retain possession and help build attacks from the back.

On the move? United hope that midfielder Anderson will join Sporting as part of a deal for Rojo

Anderson rejected moves back to Brazil last week as there were concerns whether the clubs would pay his wages on time. 

The Brazilian spent the second half of last season on loan at Italian side Fiorentina, where he made seven appearances in Serie A.

He is not in Van Gaal's plans this season and looks likely to leave Old Trafford before the close of the transfer window.
