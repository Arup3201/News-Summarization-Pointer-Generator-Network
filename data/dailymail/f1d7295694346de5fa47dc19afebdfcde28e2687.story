He's been pictured with kings and emperors, Pope's and prime ministers, but on Tuesday President Obama posed for a slightly less formal picture.

Mr Obama grinned while having his picture taken with a gawky college student after the President stopped by The Sink, a student bar, while in Denver, Colorado.

It was there he met University of Colorado student Madalyn Starkey, who's slack-jawed Instagram photo has become an instant internet classic.

'I’m not going to stand there with a smile and my lips all quivering. Of course I’m going to throw my excitement out there in a picture,' Starkey said to CBS.

She said that she intended to send the photo to her parents, but uploaded it to the web on a whim.

'He was kind of making his way around quickly but I just took a picture with him and then of course, afterwards I said to him, ‘Oh, you smell nice’ the most embarrassing thing,' Starkey said.

On the same day, another University of Colorado student met the POTUS and managed to knock yoghurt all over his pants.

Kolbi
Zerbest, 19, was among the supporters gathered to meet the president 
outside a college restaurant in Boulder, Colorado when the purple snack 
spewed over his leg.

Speaking on the Today show
on Wednesday, the college freshman said scrambling photographers had 
actually knocked over the yoghurt, adding: 'Honestly, more of it got on 
me.'

'Embarrassed': Kolbi Zerbest, 19, explained that her yoghurt spilled on President Obama during a meeting with students in Boulder, Colorado after scrambling paparazzi knocked it over

The president remained good humoured about the accident, jokingly demanding to know who was responsible before pointing out it was lucky none had spilled on the Secret Service.

'Whose yoghurt is on me?' he asked, reaching for a napkin from a Secret Service agent. 'You've got a good story to tell. You can say: "I spilled yoghurt all over the president".'

Zerbest, standing with two friends in the crowd, responded: 'I'm very embarrassed of that story. But it's a pleasure - the pleasure is all mine. I'm very sorry sir.'

Caught on camera as he wiped his trousers, Obama added: 'Getting it on the president is alright but on the Secret Service...'

Speaking on the Today show, Miss Zerbest explained the accident was actually the fault of fumbling paparazzi, and added that she was surprised the president had stopped for such a lengthy chat.

'We were just waiting there patiently, and then he came down this line of people, and... we knew we’d eventually get to shake his hand,' Miss Zerbest, speaking from Denver, explained.

'As he comes towards us a little bit more, paparazzi come rushing behind us and right as I’m shaking his hand the paparazzi kicks the bowl that I had placed on the ground onto the president.

'It was mine, so, obviously I took the blame for it... Technically it was my fault that I’d placed it there - but I’m not one who spilled it on him or kicked it on him.'

Zerbest told Msnbc that it was actually a 'Rush Bowl' - blended fruit and yoghurt with granola.

She said that there 'wasn't a lot' of yoghurt on the president. 'Honestly, more of it got on me, the ground, and on the Secret Service,' she said, adding: 'It got on his trousers a little bit, though.'

She added that she was surprised when the president stopped for a chat about the incident.

'I just expected him to shrug it off, try to clean it up a little bit and just get on with walking to his car to leave,' she said. 'So it was pretty exciting being able to talk to him for a minute or two to try to exchange what just happened.'

Unforgettable: Obama recounted the incident as he spoke to University of Colorado students later on Tuesday

Obama was in Boulder to speak at the University of Colorado about his proposal for low-rate student loans. The speech was part of a two-day, three-state swing through college campuses.

Before the yoghurt incident, the president ordered a pizza and posed for pictures with students inside the popular student bar, The Sink, for about 20 minutes.

He recounted the event to a 10,800 strong crowd during his speech later in the day.

'A woman got very excited and spilled yogurt on me,' he joked to the students. 'Or hazardously, she spilled yogurt on the Secret Service. The agent just stood there, looking at her.'
