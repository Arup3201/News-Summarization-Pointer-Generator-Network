The mother of Neon Roberts, the seven-year-old boy with cancer, said today she planned to launch an eleventh-hour appeal against him having radiotherapy.

Sally Roberts, 37, said she felt there were 'other options' for her son, who is due to begin radiotherapy next week, and said she wanted to find a medic who would back her up.

She also admitted fear of missing out on grandchildren was a factor in her fight.

Determined: Sally Roberts told Daybreak's Matt Barbet and Kate Garraway that she wanted to explore other treatments for her son

Mrs Roberts, who has been fighting against conventional medical treatment for her son's brain tumour, said this morning she planned to appeal against a court's decision that Neon should have the treatment.

She told Daybreak: 'I feel there are other options out there that we haven't explored and I would really like the opportunity to explore these other options.

'I wasn't given enough time last time to present them with what I wanted to and that was a professional expert - a medic to back what I'm saying.

'It should be my choice because I'm the one that is going to be caring for Neon or the rest... I have always been his main carer.'

'I just want to do the best thing for Neon and if the doctors have to go down their route and something happens to Neon, am I not going to hold that in my mind?'

Seriously ill: Neon Roberts is due to start radiotherapy next week

She added: 'I would like the opportunity to do all these other treatments for him.'

Neon was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour and had an operation to remove it on October 25th last year.

Doctors said he needed radiotherapy as routine follow-up treatment but his mother missed three hospital appointments and went on the run with Neon for four days without telling his father Ben, her estranged husband.

Neon is now due to begin radiotherapy next week, after a judge at the Family Division of London's High Court overruled Mrs Roberts' wishes to try alternative therapies.

The child has spent the last week being prepared for his treatment by doctors.

Today Mrs Roberts told Daybreak that she had many concerns about her son having radiotherapy, including 'damaging the DNA'.

She said: 'Just altering it and him never recovering from that.  His growth.  Infertile.

'No grandchildren is a big factor.  And there's just so many other treatments that he could be having.'

She said in countries including Germany and China, doctors used treatments including 'hyperthermia' in which heat is used to stimulate healing alongside radiotherapy and chemotherapy to lessen the risk of side effects.

Mrs Roberts said radiotherapy was 'not a sure thing' and denied that stopping it would kill her son.

'That's from the doctors here in the UK,' she said, 'We've gone abroad and found other doctors who are backing what I've been saying from the beginning.... In other countries in the world they are giving these other treatments a chance and doing very well with them.

She also refuted concerns that her son might be running out of time, saying: 'That's what they keep saying but I disagree'.

'We all want what's best for Neon': Sally Roberts on Daybreak this morning

Mrs Roberts, who is from New Zealand but lives in Brighton, East Sussex, said her son was 'doing very well' following the most recent operation to remove cancerous cells.

Neon and his twin sister, Electra, spent Christmas Day with their father, an IT consultant from Knightsbridge, west London, and his family after Mr Roberts told Mrs Roberts she was not welcome following the family rift over how best to treat Neon.

Mr Roberts believes his son should receive conventional treatment based on advice from his son's medical team.

Doctors advise that patients in cases like Neon's should receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 28 days of surgery for the best chance of survival.  The boy's doctors agree that there may be side-effects, but say that without the treatment the little boy could be dead within a few weeks.

A doctor told the court last month: 'This boy has a very highly malignant disease and he will die very quickly unless somebody gets their hands on him to treat him.'

Mrs Roberts said: 'We all want what's best for Neon.  He is the most amazing little boy.'
