A 41-year-old Texas man got a surprise when he tried to impersonate a police officer and berate a fellow driver. 

However the driver he chastised just happened to be a police detective.

Eleazar Cisneros, of Midland, confronted the driver by saying he was a police officer.

He 'aggressively' knocked on the window of the driver's car and complained about being cut off in the parking lot of a burger joint.

Woops: Eleazar Cisneros, 41, impersonated a officer in order to berate a fellow driver at the Basin Burger House in Midland, Texas. However the man turned out to be a plain-clothes detective

The detective was in an unmarked car the Basin Burger House on 607 N. Colorado St.

He asked Cisneros to show his police identification.

Cisneros said he was working under cover.

Cisneros subsequently said he was in a police academy, then acknowledged that his connection to policing was limited to taking some criminal justice classes, according to an arrest affidavit examined by the Midland Reporter-Telegram.

The detective detained Cisneros, identifying himself as an actual police officer.
