All he ever wanted to do was write, and it was a wish Leslie Thomas fulfilled.

The journalist-turned popular novelist – best known for his book The Virgin Soldiers - died at his home, surrounded by his family, earlier this week at the age of 83 after battling a lengthy illness.

The Welsh writer who was yesterday described as a ‘fount of creativity’ was orphaned aged 12 after his mariner father was lost at sea and his mother died of cancer just a few months later.

Mr Thomas began his career as a journalist in London, working for a local paper and then the London Evening News, before switching to writing full-time in 1965. He died aged 83

Mr Thomas was raised in a Barnardo's children's home from the age of 12 after his father was lost at sea and his mother died of cancer shortly after

Subsequently raised in a St Barnardo’s children’s home his time there became the inspiration for his first book, This Time Next Week.

Mr Thomas started his writing career as a news reporter in London, working for a weekly local paper and then the London Evening News before devoting himself to novel writing full-time in 1965.

He leaves four children, four grandchildren and his wife Diana who delivered a moving tribute to him.

She said: ‘He had a wonderful life and he travelled the world. All he ever wanted to do was write and that is what he did.

‘He died at home with his family around him.’

While Mr Thomas was best-known for The Virgin Soldiers, he wrote many other novels, including Last Detective - which was adapted into and ITV series - Dangerous Davies, and Orders for New York (right)

It was Mr Thomas’ time spent as a national serviceman in Malaya that inspired his most famous work, The Virgin Soldiers, a comic tale of British soldiers based in the Far East which became a bestseller and a hit film.

His other works included Dangerous Davies, the Last Detective, which was adapted for ITV, and he was given an OBE for services to literature in 2004.

Yesterday Mr Thomas’ publisher Penguin Random House also commended the late Newport-born writer.

Susan Sandon, divisional managing director at the company said: ‘Leslie Thomas was an immensely popular author with a huge gift for storytelling and a wonderful sense of humour.

‘His books have given so many people pleasure over the years, with their mix of great characters, strong sense of time and place, and unique ability to combine laughter and tears in the space of a few sentences.’

Peter Finch, a contemporary of Mr Thomas, called him a 'fount of creativity' and 'super friendly'. Mr Thomas's wife Diana (far right) said he had 'a wonderful life', adding that 'all he wanted to do was write'

Mr Thomas's publisher described him as an 'immensely popular author with a... wonderful sense of humour'

Author and former chief executive of Literature Wales, Peter Finch, also fondly remembered Mr Thomas.

He said: ‘He shied away from what he saw as Wales’s literary establishment, but did attend events encouraging young writers.

‘But he was super friendly person. There was no edge to him whatsoever. He was a slightly private person but he was good company.

‘He was a raconteur. That was his strength, which you can tell from the books.

‘He made me laugh, a lot. It’s very sad to see his fount of creativity is now extinguished.’
