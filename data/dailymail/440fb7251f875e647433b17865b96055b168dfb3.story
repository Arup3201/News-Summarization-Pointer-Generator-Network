Whatever other labels get attached to Malky Mackay, it cannot be said he lacks ambition.

That much was obvious on Saturday night in the DW Stadium long after the crowds had gone and a question was asked about Dave Whelan’s threat to quit his role as Wigan chairman.

Mackay’s mood in that instant stopped being that of the proud manager whose fresh start had ended with an impressive 1-1 draw against Middlesbrough.

He became obdurate, possibly annoyed as talk turned to Whelan’s promise from earlier in the day to resign if the FA so much as suggest he is racist.

‘I’ll talk to you about the game, guys, because you’ve had your pound of flesh from me on everything else,’ Mackay said.

On the conversation went: ‘But Malky, doesn’t it concern you that he is even considering stepping down? He’s the owner, he brought you in.’ Mackay replied: ‘I’ll talk all day long about football. If you’re here for different agendas you’re wasting your time.’

With that, it was possible to deduce that he wanted to draw a line under the public discussion of his text messages and the ham-fisted justifications from his new employers. Football talk only, please.

Except Mackay is still the subject of a farcically long Football Association investigation and until its conclusions are reached, the suggestion that issues of racist, homophobic and sexist texts — and the consequences of Whelan talking about those issues — should be parked is hopeful in the extreme.

Then again, this is football, where serious issues go with the wind if results are right.

At least Mackay got that much right on Saturday. Middlesbrough are a top-three side and came in on the back of one defeat in 12; Wigan are bottom three and had won one in 12.

But there was no escaping what has gone on. Wigan’s shirts carried a black strip across the shoulders where once was the name of Premier Range, a sponsor that no longer wants the association.

Whelan looked on without many smiles. The 77-year-old owner was clapped to his seat ahead of the match. He appeared to wipe tears from his eyes.

They love Whelan in the stadium that carries his name. As one supporter’s sign read: ‘Dave Whelan is a legend.’ It added: ‘Football is a game, do not mix with politics.’

Only politics has nothing to do with this. It is about views that are unacceptable from anyone, even those who work in football.

It would be ambitious to expect that penny to drop any time soon.
