Ryan Giggs was in Holland for showdown talks with new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal on Wednesday afternoon.

United's caretaker boss was to meet the Dutchman in Noordwijk, close to where the Holland team are currently training, as the pair looked to thrash out the legend's future at the club.

Giggs was spotted leaving the town's Hotel van Oranje mid-afternoon. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was also supposed to have been in attendance.

Talks: Ryan Giggs was pictured in Holland for a meeting with Louis van Gaal on Wednesday

Showdown: Giggs was to meet with Van Gaal for crunch talks over his Manchester United future

Meeting point: Noordwijk's Hotel van Oranje was the destination of choice for the pair

Incoming: Van Gaal is expected to be announced as the new United boss this week

Van Gaal could be announced as David Moyes' successor as early as this week, when the club will then reveal who will join the 62-year-old on the 
coaching staff.

With Phil Neville and goalkeeping coach Chris Woods on the way out and Nicky Butt, and perhaps Paul Scholes, expected to head back to coach the club’s Under 18s, it is Giggs’ future that remains shrouded in doubt.

Van Gaal was expected to hand Giggs a coaching role at the meeting. However, whether or not he decides to stay will depend on whether he thinks the role he is offered is senior enough. He has already indicated privately that he will not stick around if he thinks he is not going to be a fundamental part of the set-up.

Van Gaal is currently in the thick of preparing the Dutch team for a friendly with Ecuador on Saturday and the World Cup in Brazil next month.

However, Holland's players enjoyed a day off on Wednesday, enabling the coach to meet Giggs and Woodward to discuss the way forward.

Switch: Van Gaal announced his Holland team will play a 5-3-2 at the World Cup in Brazil

He revealed a shock change in tactics, from the traditional Dutch 4-3-3 to a seemingly more defensive 5-3-2, at a press conference in Hoenderloo on Tuesday — but refused to say much about United.

‘That is for Manchester United to comment on,’ he said.

‘No, I would not say anything about it. I am here for the Dutch team, not as coach of Manchester United. You’ll have to wait until the process is finished or (put) questions to Manchester United — or perhaps to another club. I cannot say anything further.’

Different directions: Phil Neville (left) will be cut from the coaching staff, though he hasn't been told formally, while Paul Scholes will have a meeting on Thursday to discuss his future role at the club

Bearer: United chief Ed Woodward broke the news to Neville in the dressing room after Sunday's game

Top target: Southampton and England left back Luke Shaw has been linked with a £27m move

Switch: Robin van Persie was involved in the decision to switch Holland to a 5-3-2 formation
