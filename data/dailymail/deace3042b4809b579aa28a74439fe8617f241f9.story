A feud over staff lunches at a private boys school has become a lawyers' feast.

Staff at one of Adelaide's most prestigious schools, St Peter's College, have always got the luxury of supplied lunches, it's believed for about 150 years, but now the school has removed the longstanding lunch subsidies, without any consultation.

It's forced angry staff to launch legal action against the school, who claim they have made the change in a bid to cut costs, which sees them fork out around $340,000 a year.

Food Feud : Staff at St Peter's College Adelaide have taken legal action against the school after they removed school lunch subsidies

Both parties have enlisted the help of heavyweight QCs and will appear before the Fair Work Commission in arbitration hearings this month.

All teachers and staff have been instructed not to speak to the media but representing them is the Independent Education Union who claim the school has been unwilling to negotiate with staff.

'We've got a situation where ... a long-established entitlement has been removed,' state secretary Glen Seidel told ABC radio.

'It's unfortunate that it's around something as eminently mockable as lunches.'

More than 200 staff are affected by the loss of the lunch subsidies which is worth about $3000 annually for each staff member.

The Independent Education Union claim the school has been unwilling to negotiate with staff.

'The provision of staff lunches at a cost of $340,000 (per year) when the school needs to operate in a highly competitive education environment was, in the opinion of the School Council, unacceptable,' said a St Peter's spokesperson

'It had been tradition for staff to take their meals with students in the school dining room,' Mr Seidel said.

'Obviously there's a lot of tension around this whole issue on both sides, It really shouldn't have got to this stage.'

In a statement, a college spokeswoman said the staff lunches were an anachronistic benefit rarely available in Australian workplaces.

'The reality for St Peter's College is that it must put its finances on a sustainable footing,' she said.

'The provision of staff lunches at a cost of $340,000 (per year) when the school needs to operate in a highly competitive education environment was, in the opinion of the School Council, unacceptable.'
