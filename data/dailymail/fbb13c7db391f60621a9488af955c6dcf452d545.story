The Mr Bean and Blackadder star suffered a shoulder injury in the August 2011 crash but his McLaren F1 supercar took a year to recover at the hands of McLaren's technicians

His accident-prone alter ego Mr Bean is every insurer’s nightmare.

But spare a thought for Rowan Atkinson’s real-life broker.

The actor has successfully claimed £910,000 to fix his McLaren F1 supercar after destroying it in a crash – the highest repair bill ever recorded in Britain.

Atkinson lost control of the 240mph car, thought to be worth more than £3million, in August 2011.

After veering off a slippery section of the A605 near Peterborough, it hit a tree and burst into flames.

But while the 58-year-old star escaped from the wreckage with a broken shoulder, his vehicle – one of just 64 models in the world – did not escape so lightly.

Most of the back of the car was destroyed while the 6.1litre engine ended up 20 yards away.

Atkinson’s insurers spent nearly eight months considering the claim, before agreeing the massive payout.

Now, after more than a year of specialist repairs at McLaren’s base in Woking, Surrey, it is as good as new.

However, Atkinson, who is reportedly worth £71million, has not escaped scot-free. According to experts, the star’s car insurance premium will have risen to up to £60,000 a year as a result of the expensive crash.

Ben Stagg, a senior client manager at specialist insurers RK Harrison, said: ‘It costs between £10-15,000 a year just to keep a McLaren F1 insured off-road in a garage.

The McLaren F1 supercar was left as a mangled wreck after Rowan Atkinson crashed into a tree in August 2011. It was his second crash in the vehicle, which saw its 6.1 litre engine flung 20 yards away from the rest of it

'If you want to drive it - and it 
seems Mr Atkinson drives his a lot - your premium could rise to between 
£20-40,000 a year because of the added road risk.

‘Now he has crashed it, Mr Atkinson’s insurers may increase the premium by another 50 per cent.

‘They could also insert a limited mileage clause and increase his excess to around half the car’s  total value.’

Expensive: Atkinson, seen with his wife Sunetra, paid £634,500 for the maroon sports car in 1997, but has seen its value soar in recent years

The six-figure payout for the actor's McLaren F1 is the highest insurance bill recorded in Britain

Playing Mr Bean, Atkinson drove a 
clapped-out Mini. In real life, he uses his McLaren for commuting 
between his Northamptonshire home and acting commitments in London, as 
well as family holidays.

Atkinson paid £634,500 for the maroon sports car in 1997, but has seen its value soar in recent years.

Last year, one model sold for 
£3.4million. By the time of the crash, he had recorded 38,000 miles on 
the odometer. Atkinson said getting back in the driving seat after 16 
months was ‘like getting into a familiar sweater’. He added: ‘It has 
become part of my life. I hope to do 100,000 miles in it.’

The crash was Atkinson’s second accident in the supercar. In 1999, he ploughed it into the back of a Rover Metro.

The £910,000 bill is three times as 
much as the previous record payout for a repair. In 2010, Aviva paid 
£300,000 to fix a Pagani Zonda test car.

Cost new: £540,000 (Atkinson paid £640,000 for his in 1997)

Value now: Up to £3.5 million

Engine: 6.1-litre V12 developing 627bhp

Acceleration: 0-60mph in 3.2 seconds; 0-100mph in 6.3 seconds

Top speed: 240mph

Seats: Three with driver centrally positioned
