When Ashante Fowlkes suddenly stopped breathing Wednesday night in her Detroit home, her husband called 911 hoping to get help for his wife.

Instead, Jerome Fowlkes says the dispatcher who answered his call was rude to him and eventually hung up without sending over an ambulance.

Mr Fowlkes, a married father of three, also stated that the emergency operator accused him of trying to pull a prank on her, but that claim has been disputed.

The incident took place Wednesday night when Ashante Fowlkes, who suffers from blood clots in her lungs, collapsed and stopped breathing.

Mr Fowlkes instructed his son, Deonte, to call 911 while he went to work trying to revive his unconscious wife.

‘I grabbed the phone from him. [I was] trying to ask them how to do CPR and the operator said “this is a prank. I'm terminating the call,"’ Fowlkes told MyFox Chicago.

The frantic husband then had his daughter, Da’Jana, call 911 again, and this time another operator said she will be sending an ambulance over. But the family decided not to wait any longer and took Ashante Fowlkes to the hospital themselves.

The 41-year-old wife and mother was taken to Sinai Grace Hospital, where she was listed in stable condition.

On Thursday, Mrs Fowlkes posted a status update on her Facebook account saying that she and her family were praying for her to get better.

Detroit Police Assistant Chief James White told the station that he did not like the tone of the dispatcher on the 911 call, but he insisted that she did not accuse Mr Fowlkes of trying to play a practical joke on her.

Jerome Fowlkes has filed an official complaint against the emergency system operator, and the Detroit Police Department has launched an investigation into the Wednesday night call.
