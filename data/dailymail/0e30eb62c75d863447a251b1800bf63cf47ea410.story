An English striker with a hunger for goals and an even bigger appetite for hard work, Harry Kane may not be Spurs’ most polished player, but he is certainly shining right now.

He scored his 11th of the season to set his team on their way during Sunday’s 2-1 win at Swansea, a powerful header his latest instinctive effort from inside the penalty area.

It was the third time that Kane has scored in a 2-1 triumph away from home this term, the points to which those goals equate proving the difference between seventh and 11th.

Harry Kane rose above the rest to score the opening goal during Tottenham's win against Swansea City 

It is patently obvious what playing for his boyhood club means to the striker

And this, don’t forget, from a 21-year-old who started the campaign as very much the understudy to leading man Emmanuel Adebayor.

The Spurs strikers define polar opposites of the scale measured by effort, energy and endeavour.

Kane is all action, he wears his heart on both sleeves. At the Liberty Stadium he ran a staggering 8.2miles, a distance only matched by Christian Eriksen among the visiting team.

Some may argue he lacks the finesse of the very top forwards, but if goals are the currency in which strikers trade, Kane is cash rich. From 23 senior starts for Spurs, he has 17 goals.

The manner in which he first sniffs out chances and then disposes of them is at times effortless, a natural instinct which very few boast. He certainly won’t hide should opportunities go begging, either.

But there is more to his game. His performance in last month’s 2-1 win over Everton – in which he didn’t score but assisted both goals – drew praise from Jamie Carragher, the Sky pundit and Sportsmail columnist, declaring that Kane had been the best player on the pitch.

He invigorates others with an urgency and enthusiasm sadly lacking in too many residing at White Hart Lane in recent seasons.

The Chingford-born Spurs fan is a mascot for supporters – ‘Harry Kane, he’s one of our own’ – and with him in the team it injects belief and excitement.

Kane is a completely different striker to the much-maligned Emmanuel Adebayor

Kane's desire and work ethic have made him a firm fans' favourite in under a season around the first team 

He has won his place in the side through a single-minded determination – there is no big price tag or inflated reputation to justify his inclusion, it is down to the will of the player alone.

In an age where academy graduates are all too expectant of progression and bemoan a lack of opportunity, Kane has served his time at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester.

From League One to the Premier League and eight goals in the Europa League, Kane is proving himself very able.

Perhaps Roy Hodgson should check on his progress. For Kane – who is also eligible for Republic of Ireland – has already announced his intention to break in to the England senior team.

And when Harry Kane sets his target, you wouldn’t bet against him hitting it.
