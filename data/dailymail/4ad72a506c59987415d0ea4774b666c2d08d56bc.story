iPhone owners are vainer and spend more on clothes and grooming than those who have BlackBerrys and Android phones, new research claims.

BlackBerry owners earn the most and are more likely to have long-term relationships, while people with Android handsets have the best manners and are handy in the kitchen.

The study, commissioned by TalkTalk Mobile,  surveyed 2,000 owners of the three major smartphone brands to determine whether the choice of handset was an extension of their personality.

Research from TalkTalk mobile surveyed 2,000 smartphone users about their personality, habits and jobs. Apple owners were the most ambitious and vain, BlackBerry owners earned the most and people with Android phones are the most polite, creative and better chefs

Apple iPhone owners, pictured,are more vain and spend more on clothes and grooming than those who have BlackBerrys and Android handsets, according to new research from TalkTalk. They also rate themselves as 'flirty and bright' and are most likely to work in media

Other results from the study found that people with an iPhone are more
 image conscious and generally rate themselves more attractive than 
those with other handsets.

BlackBerry owners, however, are busier, send more messages and emails and make more calls than their Apple opposites.

They also earn nearly two and a half thousand pounds a year more than other smartphone owners, with an average salary of £27,406.

The research pitted the mobile giants against one another and found those with a BlackBerry are also more likely to have long-term relationships, be more social and have more friends overall.

Android owners were found to be watch more TV than others and drink the most alcohol - consuming more in an
 average week than iPhone and BlackBerry drinkers.

They were also found to drink more tea and coffee each day than any 
other phone user.

People
 who own an iPhone are most likely to describe themselves as 
daring, flirty or bright and are most likely to work in media, 
publishing, retail and education.

They also believe they are valued most by their bosses.

Apple owners also tend to have done more travelling and are the most active on social media sites.

Those on Android had the most jobs in
 engineering, the Government and public services and environmental 
services and were more shy and relaxed than their counterparts.

Dan Meader, Director of Mobile at 
TalkTalk, said: 'Many of us have our mobile phones on us almost 
constantly so they do become an extension of us in many ways.

'It's interesting to see then how the 
choice in handset may reflect different aspects of personality and the 
results do reveal some quirky differences.

'Once you see yourself as a certain 
type of phone user, it can become a huge part of the way you live your 
life and people tend to subscribe to the one they feel suits them best.

 'Of course, simply buying a certain type of phone doesn't mean your personality or way of living immediately changes, but the results could suggest that certain types of personality are drawn to different features and functions of certain handsets.'

Although BlackBerry owners were found to have the most friends, iPhone users have travelled the most and are more active on social networks
