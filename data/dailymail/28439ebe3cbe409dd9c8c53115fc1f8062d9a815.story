The ex-wife of a multimillion-pound fraudster who used his ill-gotten gains to sponsor rugby stars such as Kenny Logan has been cleared of concealing his scam.

Gerald Porter, 51, cheated his firm Greenfield Property Management Limited out of £3.2 million to lead a luxury lifestyle that included driving expensive cars, taking luxury holidays and throwing lavish parties.

The huge rugby fan also spent some of the cash on the Wasps side and their winger Kenny Logan, the husband of TV sports presenter Gabby Logan.

The Scotsman used company credit cards to splash out on VIP games, sponsor players and buy them flash cars and dinners at Michelin starred restaurants, London's Southwark Crown Court heard.

His former wife Jacqui, 40, of Ruislip, west London, was accused of concealing or converting proceeds of crime. But a jury cleared her after more than five hours of deliberation.

Speaking after her acquittal, she said: 'After one and a half years of hell it is a huge relief.' 

She and  Porter - who was jailed for five years in March for conspiracy to defraud - went on a mammoth spending spree well beyond his legitimate £60,000 salary.

The family blew £132,000 on exotic holidays in two years and a bouncy castle was permanently erected in the ‘park-like gardens’ of their rented mansion.

Jurors heard how rugby-mad Gerald cheated on his long suffering wife and partied at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. 

Meanwhile, Mrs Porter splurged thousands on designer spending sprees across the world blowing thousands of pounds on shoes, handbags and clothes in Versace, Emporio Armani and other designer labels in Dubai.

But she claimed the Barclaycard, which was funded by the company, was only used for ‘emergencies’.

She told jurors she was ‘totally unaware’ of her Scottish husband’s fraudulent activities.

Former Scottish international Kenny Logan told the trial how he had been duped into thinking the fraudster was a genuine sponsor.

Mr Logan, 42, said he believed Porter was a property developer who was 'happily spending money and I knew no reason to believe he was dodgy'.

Mr Logan said Porter was well known in the world of rugby and 'he had the fast cars and consistently spent money for years'.

Well known for his penchant for helicopter trips, Porter was 'very well known at Wasps and was the go-to man when it came to sponsorship', Mr Logan said.

Jurors heard that Porter donated £100,000 of Greenfield cash to Championship side London Scottish while the west London-based club were struggling financially and in the fourth tier of the English rugby league.

Mr Logan added: 'He always drove expensive vehicles and was often seen around at functions in his Bentley which changed to a Land Rover Sport.

'He would also think nothing of hiring helicopters to fly people to events.'

The fraudster also arranged for officials at London Wasps to get a Mercedes.

It only emerged after a coach left and tried to return the luxury car that no one knew about the arrangement. Porter also sponsored an end-of-season dinner which Mr Logan believed would have cost about £15,000 and paid £5,816 for a table at a dinner which he never used.

Mr Logan added: 'I was also in his company at restaurants where he would purchase the top wines. It was the top restaurants such as Claridge's in London.'

Mr Logan, who is married to TV presenter Gabby Logan (left), said he was ashamed to have introduced Mr Porter to his mother-in-law Christine Yorath (pictured, right, with her husband, former footballer Terry Yorath)

But in early 2010 Porter told Mr Logan he was 'in trouble' and had stolen money. Mr Logan told him to leave his home and he has not seen him since.

He told jurors: 'I feel entirely let down by Mr Porter. I acted in good faith in everything that I did with him.'

Mr Logan recalled later hearing people call him Dr Porter, but said 'I suspect that this was part of his life of fantasy which we were all entangled in'.

Mrs Porter met her future husband while working as an industrial chemicals saleswoman when he offered her a lift in his forklift truck across a muddy Uxbridge building site in 1994.

Evidence: Mrs Porter said her husband was away for long periods on trips where he would cheat on her, go to sporting events and even the Playboy Mansion, picture, on one occasion, the court heard

He initially moved into her three-bed council home but by 2005 the family with two new children moved to a five-bed rented mansion costing more than £32,000 a year.

The ex-policeman had a number of affairs throughout their relationship but Jacqui stuck by her husband, saying she felt responsible for becoming ‘fat and unattractive’ after the birth of her fourth child.

‘A package came through my door with a bundle of emails in it - they were very explicit,’ she sobbed.

‘They basically said Gerry had been having an affair with a lady he worked with and that I was stupid that I didn’t realise what had been going on, that basically he was a cad and philanderer and that I should leave him.’

Gerald also took a ‘high ranking police officer’ as a lover and temporarily left the family home, she told jurors.

The family jetted across the globe, taking luxury holidays to Bermuda, Mexico, Dubai and New Zealand which would have required an ‘astronomic’ salary to support them.

They boasted a fleet of cars, including a Bentley used as a ‘company car’, a Range Rover, a BMW and a VW Beetle.

The couple spent £130,000 a year - their total legitimate household income - on private school fees for their four children to attend prestigious St. Benedict’s in Ealing.

And they hosted lavish parties at the family’s rented mansion in Harefield, Hillingdon, where a bouncy castle stood in the ‘park-like’ gardens.

A further £62,000 was spent wining and dining at Royal Ascot and helicopters were chartered to ferry the family around.

One helicopter trip from Glasgow airport to Culzean Castle in Ayrshire where the family rented a £1800 per month flat cost £2742.

Jacqui’s niece Alice Moss visited Scotland twice with the Porters, on one occasion staying at the Turnberry Hotel, a five-star golf resort and spa.

‘Gerald flew in to the Turnberry by helicopter and landed in the grounds - people thought that somebody famous was coming,’ she said.
