Runway show will be part of four-day Coronation festival in July

Brands include Hunter wellies, Gieves & Hawkes and Dege & Skinner

From their love of Hunter wellies to their penchant for Barbour jackets, the Royal family are known for their quintessentially British style.

In December the Palace announced that they would be hosting a summer catwalk show as part of the four-day 
Coronation Festival celebrating the 60th anniversary of the 
Queen's coronation.

And today the full details of July's style extravaganza featuring royal warrant 
holders have been released ... and the best news is that there are still public tickets available for the daytime festival.

The catwalk shows form part of the 
daytime entertainment programme for the four day Coronation Festival - a one off event hosted by the Royal Warrant Holders 
Association which will bring together over 200 Warrant holding companies
 to celebrate innovation, industry and excellence.

The event will take place between July 
11 and July 14 2013 and will offer a candid insight into the products 
the Royal family use and love.

Brands on show will include Savile Row 
tailors Gieves & Hawkes and Dege & Skinner, alongside the 
Queen's favourite country footwear Hunter wellingtons, Milborrow chimney 
sweeps and the bespoke Tom Smith Christmas crackers bought by the Queen 
for celebrations at Sandringham.

A 400 seat raised catwalk surrounded by a bed of flowers in the Buckingham Palace Gardens will be the location for a series of unique fashion shows designed to tell the story of British fashion and iconic style over the past sixty years, showcasing companies that have been awarded the prestigious Royal Warrant of Appointment.

The long catwalk will blend in with the Gardens taking the guise of a paved stone garden path adorned on the edges and sides with flowers to complement its unique back drop and audience bench seating for will give the illusion of crafted topiary hedges.

Five catwalk shows have now been confirmed for each day, a mix of four themes collectively paying tribute to the six varied decades since the Coronation of HM The Queen in 1953.

Savile Row’s finest tailors including Gieves & Hawkes, Dege & Skinner, Henry Poole & Co and Johns & Pegg, plus tailors Benson & Clegg, Thresher & Glenny and Kent Haste Lachter will join fellow Royal Warrant holders DAKS, Austin Reed, Hunter Boots, Ettinger, John Lewis and Peter Jones to showcase their latest collections in this catwalk celebration of British style.

are very proud of so it is an honour for us to be involved.'
