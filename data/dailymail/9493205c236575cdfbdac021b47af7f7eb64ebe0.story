Two Islamic terrorists who plotted mass murder claim their human rights were violated when they were segregated in jail after they were accused of trying to dictate the faith of other prisoners.

Ricin plot conspirator Kamel Bourgass and 'liquid bomber' Tanvir Hussain have today taken their legal battle to the Supreme Court.

It follows a ruling in March 2012 when they failed to persuade appeal judges that their treatment was unlawful.

They were alleged to have intimidated and bullied other inmates over matters of faith, so the authorities in their respective jails decided to separate them from other prisoners 'for good order and discipline'.

Both men denied accusations that they tried to influence and dictate the beliefs of other prisoners.

Their QC Dinah Rose told the Supreme Court today: 'The issue in these appeals is one of fairness.'

She said: 'Fairness requires that prisoners should be provided with sufficient information about the reasons and evidence relied on to justify the initial decision to segregate them, and their continuing segregation, so as to enable them to make meaningful and effective representations in their defence.

'Fairness also requires that, at least once it is apparent that the segregation is not simply a short-term measure, prisoners should be afforded the opportunity to challenge the decision to segregate them before a body that is independent of the prison, and which is empowered to determine whether the factual case against them is made out and whether their continued segregation is justified.'

Bourgass, an Algerian, is serving 17 years for conspiracy to commit public nuisance by using poisons or explosives in relation to the 2002 Ricin terrorist plot.

He is also serving a life sentence for murdering Detective Constable Stephen Oake, 40, with a kitchen knife during his 2003 arrest at a flat in Manchester.

He injured four other officers during that attack and is serving sentences for attempted murder of two officers and wounding a third.

Hussain was one of three men convicted of a plot to launch suicide attacks on flights from Heathrow to America and Canada using liquid bombs made of hydrogen peroxide hidden in soft drink bottles. He is serving life with a minimum tariff of 32 years.

While detained at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire, Bourgass was segregated from March 10 2010 until April 22 and again from April 23 until October or November of that year. 

Hussain was segregated at HMP Frankland in County Durham from April 24 2010 until October 2010.

Ms Rose told Supreme Court president Lord Neuberger, Lady Hale and Lords Sumption, Reed and Hodge that neither man was provided with adequate reasons or information concerning the evidence relied on to justify their initial or continued segregation.

They were 'not informed of what they were required to do in order for their segregation to end, and were not afforded the opportunity to challenge the relevant decisions before an independent body'.

Hearing: The Supreme Court in London has set aside two days to consider if the dangerous prisoners were badly treated

She argued that 'in the circumstances', the decisions to segregate them and to continue that segregation were 'unlawful'.

Ms Rose told the court: 'In each case there was said to be a suspicion that the appellants had been involved in assaults on other prisoners.

'In neither case was there sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges or sustain internal prison disciplinary charges against them.'

Both men, she said, were held in segregation in different prisons for approximately six months and during that time they were locked alone in a cell for 23 hours a day and permitted only one hour of exercise a day, 'which had to be taken alone in a cage'.

The QC submitted that there were a number of reasons why 'stringent standards of fairness must be applied', including the serious effects of segregation on prisoners, particularly when it was prolonged.

'It is accepted that segregation carries a high risk of deterioration in mental health, and that after the segregation has continued for a period in excess of two weeks there is a risk of irreparable damage to the prisoner,' she said.

In February 2011 a High Court judge said the procedures adopted to place them in, and keep them in, segregation did not breach their common law rights, or their rights under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights to fair treatment. 

During a new two-day hearing the justices will also hear argument on behalf of the Justice Secretary and the Howard League for Penal Reform.

The case continues. 

Kamel Bourgass

Suspected Al Qaeda Bourgass was plotting to use the deadly poison ricin and murdered of a Special Branch detective during his arrest

Kamel Bourgass, then a 31-year-old failed Algerian asylum seeker, turned a Manchester flat into a bloodbath as he was cornered by police.

He grabbed a kitchen knife and killed Detective Constable Stephen Oake, stabbing him eight times. He also knifed three other policemen during his bloody escape bid.

At the time Bourgass, who was also known as Nadir Habra, was on the run after his attempts to make ricin and other poisons were discovered at a flat in Wood Green, north London, in a raid by anti-terrorist police nine days earlier.

Detectives believe he had been trained in terror camps in Afghanistan run by Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and was specially selected for instruction in making poisons and explosives. 

According to an alleged co-conspirator, who co-operated with authorities when he was arrested in Algeria, Bourgass was planning to smear poison on the door handles of cars and buildings in the Holloway area of north London.

Detectives believe he might also have had plans to use it in spray form or to contaminate consumer products.

In the London raid, police found accurate recipes and ingredients for poisons including ricin, cyanide and botulinum - one of the most toxic substances known to man - and the blueprint for a bomb. 

Tanvir Hussain

Despite his love of clubbing, smoking cannabis and chasing girls, Tanvir Hussain turned to extremism after Britain's invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. 

After the 7/7 bombings he told a colleague at an NHS clinic at St Anne's Hospital in North London, where he worked as a temp, that Muslims were being persecuted.

Born in Blackburn, he moved to London aged six with his Pakistani family.

But he joined as gang of Islamic fanatics planned to use liquid explosives disguised as soft drinks to blow at least seven flights out of the sky and cause carnage to rival 9/11 in the U.S.

A second phase of the plan included attacks on Canary Wharf skyscrapers, the Greenwich foot tunnel underneath the Thames, nuclear power stations, oil refineries and gas terminals.

The discovery of the plot in 2006 brought chaos to international airports as sweeping restrictions were imposed overnight on how much liquid can be taken on to a plane.

He was found guilty and jailed in 2009.
