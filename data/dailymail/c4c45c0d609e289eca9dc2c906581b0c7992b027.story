It has eluded some of the world's finest minds for more than a century.

Mathematicians, cryptographers and linguists have all tried and failed to solve the message inside the 'the world's most mysterious medieval manuscript'.

The repeated failures to find anything has led many to claim that the so-called Voynich book is a hoax.

Discovery: A new study has claimed that the Voynich book  - which dates back to the early 1400s - may hold a genuine message

Mysterious: The book has been dated to the early 1400s, but it largely disappeared from public record until 1912

However, a new study has claimed that the book - which dates back to the early 1400s - may hold a genuine message.

Scientists studying the mysterious text say they have found linguistic patterns which could be meaningful words hidden within the text.

Marcelo Montemurro, a theoretical physicist from the University of Manchester, says he believes his research - which has been published in the journal Plos One -  could eventually lead to unraveling the mystery of the manuscript.

Strange:  Mathematicians, cryptographers and linguists have all tried and failed to solve the message inside the manuscript

Speaking to the BBC, Dr Montemurro, who has spent years analysing the linguistic patterns within the manuscript, said: 'The text is unique, there are no similar works and all attempts to decode any possible message in the text have failed.

'It's not easy to dismiss the manuscript as simple nonsensical gibberish, as it shows a significant [linguistic] structure.'

In an attempt to decode the text, Dr Montemurro used a computerised statistical method  - an approach known to work on other languages.

It involved focusing on how the words were arranged. Despite finding semantic patterns within the manuscript, what the words mean still remain a mystery.

Breakthrough: Scientists studying the mysterious text say they have found linguistic patterns which they believe could be meaningful words

He admits this still leaves many unanswered questions but insists there must be a story behind the text.

Despite making this breakthrough, many are still unconvinced.

Academic Gordoni Rugg, from Keele University, says the new findings do not rule out the theory that the manuscript is a hoax.

The mystery behind the book has long baffled experts.

It has been dated to the early 1400s but disappeared from public record until 
1912.

Wilfrid Voynich, an antique book dealer,   bought it 
amongst a number of second-hand publications in Italy.

It was investigated by a team of code breakers during the 
Second World War. Despite being able to discover enemy messages, they 
were unable to find any meaning in the text.
