A touching video shows the incredible moment a teenager took his first steps having spent his entire life using a wheelchair. 

Octavio Nieto, 17, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at birth and was told he would never walk unaided, so he used a wheelchair or walker to get around.

But the teenager surprised everyone when he determinedly walked 50 paces on his own at his high school gym in front of his teachers and classmates.

The senior, who was enrolled in a special needs program at Tesoro High School in Orange County, California, had started using his walker to move around the school track, KCAL9 reported.

He was hoping to earn 'Tesoro dollars' - fake money which is handed to students as an incentive to achieve their goals - which he planned to exchange for a Tinker Bell DVD.

Teacher Dave Bulloch told the news channel how earlier this month Octavio had been walking around the school track aided by his walker when he looked up and saw a plane.

'And he asked me, is that a shooting star? And I said no buddy that's a plane, why do you ask? And he goes oh, cause I wanted to make a wish,' Mr Bulloch said.

'He just came out and said I want to be able to walk without a walker,' Octavio's other teacher Kevin Corbett added.

'I said why do you want to do that and he said because I want you guys to be proud of me.'

Mr Corbett is seen in the video standing behind Octavio to make sure he doesn't fall while  Mr Bulloch led him forward.

'It's just been the most incredible Christmas present you could ask for as a teacher to be able to see a student take his first steps,' Mr Corbett said.

Octavio's next goal is to walk across the stage at his graduation in May without using a walker.
