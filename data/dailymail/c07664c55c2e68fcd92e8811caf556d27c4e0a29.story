Factsheet: The RSPCA has a factsheet advising families to put out scraps of food in the garden to feed hungry foxes. But experts have desccribed the advice as 'irresponsible'

Experts have condemned the RSPCA as being ‘very irresponsible’  for advising families to put out scraps of food in the garden to feed hungry foxes.

The astonishing suggestion emerged just days after a baby boy had his finger bitten off by a fox that attempted to drag him out the door of his home.

The RSPCA guidance offers ‘cheese, boiled potatoes, raw chicken pieces, bread and table scraps’ as suitable foods in answer to the query ‘How can I help foxes living in the area?’. It adds that providing food ‘could help and even give you a chance to watch them’.

The leaflet, entitled ‘Living with foxes’, and designed to be printed off the internet, recommends ear plugs for residents who are tired of hearing foxes shrieking in mating season. It also includes a section about how to deter foxes.

The suggestion to provide food appears very different from comments by the charity after the attack on five-week-old Denny Dolan in Bromley, South-East London.

A male fox tried to snatch him away by dragging him out of the door by his hand.  His mother Hayley Cawley fought the animal off and doctors had to reattach his left ring finger after the fox bit it off in the attack last week.

On Sunday, the RSPCA appeared to discourage feeding, saying: ‘It’s extremely unusual for foxes to attack young children or anyone.

‘It’s not typical fox behaviour at all. Foxes will come closer to a house if there are food sources. Then they can become quite bold, but they usually do back off and run away when there’s people around.’ However, the leaflet continues to be available online.

Last night, pest control expert Peter Crowden warned: ‘If you feed foxes, they will be encouraged to go into people’s homes in search of more food. You shouldn’t feed foxes in your garden.

‘They will come closer and closer to get food. When your novelty of feeding them wears off, that’s when they will start entering houses.

‘The RSPCA are very irresponsible for issuing this advice.

Advice: The leaflet, entitled 'Living with foxes', encourages residents to wear to wear earplugs to avoid hearing foxes shrieking in mating season

‘People are encouraged to feed them and you see people feeding them out of their hands in their lounges. But foxes are wild animals and they will stay wild animals. If you want to feed wild animals, go to the zoo.’ Mr Crowden said fortnightly rubbish collections were responsible for swelling fox numbers in populated areas.

‘Councils should be cleaning the streets and getting rid of rubbish. That’s the only way to prevent the numbers growing,’ he said.

National Pest Technicians Association chief executive John Davison said foxes coming into homes is a problem people have created.

He said: ‘You will get one fox and two or three people are putting food out, even trying to get it to take from their hand, and the fox gets used to people and will stray into properties if it thinks there’s food.

‘It’s a problem we humans have created, it’s not the fox’s doing.’

Injured: The advice is still available despite an attack on five-week-old Denny Dolan

The RSPCA has recently come under increasing criticism for its seeming transition from an animal welfare organisation to a political organisation intent on prosecuting fox hunting. Last night the RSPCA said: ‘We would encourage people to use humane deterrents and to make sure there is no food source available if foxes are coming into their gardens and they are concerned.

‘The factsheet referred to makes it clear that the most humane and long-term solution is to discourage foxes from your garden by removing or preventing access to what attracts them – however some people are determined to feed wild animals in their garden.

‘As stated in the factsheet the RSPCA often get asked about foxes, including what food they eat, as well as what risks foxes pose or how they can be deterred from gardens. The factsheet deals with each of these issues.

‘To be clear, the RSPCA does not encourage or endorse the feeding of foxes.’
