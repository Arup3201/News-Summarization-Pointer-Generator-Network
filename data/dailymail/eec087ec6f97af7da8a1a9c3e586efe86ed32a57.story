England are confident Ben Youngs can thrive on a return to the starting XV at Eden Park on Saturday after first-choice scrum half Danny Care was ruled out.

Care was named in the tourists’ original line-up for the first Test against the All Blacks, but a fitness test on a shoulder injury confirmed he would miss the series opener. Youngs is promoted from the bench.

It has not been a vintage season for Youngs, but Stuart Lancaster claimed he is returning to peak form in time for this daunting clash with the world champions.

Speaking before Care was definitively 
ruled out, England’s head coach said: ‘Losing Danny would be a big blow 
but that would be lessened by Ben, whose form picked up at the end of 
the season. If you go back to the game in 2012 when he started against 
New Zealand, that was him at his best and he’s approaching that form.

‘To go into a Test against the All Blacks with anyone (Care) who is not 100 per cent physically would be a poor decision.’

Yet
 another enforced reshuffle by England means a bench role for Lee 
Dickson, even though he was involved in last Saturday’s Aviva 
Premiership final.

‘Lee’s buzzing,’ added Lancaster. ‘He’ll be ready, no problem.’

Faith: England coach Stuart Lancaster believes Youngs is returning to his top form in time for the daunting New Zealand tour
