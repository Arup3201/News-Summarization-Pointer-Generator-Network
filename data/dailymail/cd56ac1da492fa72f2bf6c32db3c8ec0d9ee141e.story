A pair of gutsy acrobats have crossed Zimbabwe's awe-inspiring Victoria Falls on a tightrope.

Lukas Irmler from Germany and Reinhard Kleindl from Austria completed the 328ft crossing on a slack line, after negotiating with officials for several months to get permission.

They both made the crossing without falling off, ultimately not using the safety cords attached to the line.

Mr Irmler told Sky News: 'Here you have a lot of spray, a lot of water in the air, floating beside you, splashing your face and it's intimidating on the one side but also distracting.

'You need to have a clear visual view of the environment, you need to be focused on the anchor point to the very end you want to walk to and not get distracted by a lot of water crashing by the side, which is very hard mentally.'

Mr Kleindl added: 'Optically it's very difficult because the spray comes from the sides and it's like waves, they try to drag you, so it's really difficult for the optics and obviously everything is very heavy because it's soaked with water.'

While it is neither the highest nor the widest waterfall in the world, it is classified as the largest, based on its width of 5,604ft and height of 354ft.

Eight days ago Nik Wallenda completed two death-defying high-wire walks between skyscrapers at an intense incline, and then with a blindfold on a cable suspended more than 500ft over the Chicago River.

Footage of the astonishing feat ran on a 10-second delay on the Discovery Channel so producers could cut away if he fell to his death.

He had neither a net nor a harness as he completed the challenge - and had said his only back-up plan was to attempt to kneel and cling to the wire with his feet.

Brave: Wallenda successfully walked over the Chicago River between two skyscrapers - the rope had an incline of eight stories

Blinded: Wallenda had set up a speaker making 'ping' noises at his destination so he knew where he was aiming while blindfolded

He finished the first portion of the stunt in six minutes, 52 seconds, and made the second, blindfolded walk in just one minute, 17 seconds.

The first wire was suspended more than 500ft above the Chicago River at a 19-degree incline. The wire was supposed to be suspended at 15 degrees, but a last minute change made for an even steeper challenge.

He broke two Guinness world records in the process - for the highest inclined tightrope walk, and the highest blindfolded walk.
