We have been treated to some cracking Barclays Premier League action this season with some excellent individual performances.

Chelsea lead and have been dominant, but only three points separate them and Manchester City. 

We’re almost half way through as we enter 2015 and here is Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown's Premier League team of the season so far...

Goalkeeper 

David de Gea (Manchester United) 

Over the last two years he has been the only Manchester United player performing at the levels you would expect of that club. He has matured, gets more reliable with every game he plays and is now absolutely key to any success they have.

De Gea has been Manchester United's best player this year, earning them valuable points 

Defence 

Nathaniel Clyne (Southampton) 

Clyne’s has been an incredible rise. He has gone from Crystal Palace to Southampton to England and not once looked out of his depth. It will be a job for anyone to replace him in Roy Hodgson’s team.

Nathaniel Clyne has developed hugely at Southampton this year, putting in a string of top performances

The Southampton full back's form has earned him an England call-up this season

Gary Cahill (Chelsea) 

John Terry has been good but Cahill is now Chelsea’s main man in defence. He has learned from his partner but is an excellent defender in his own right. He is strong, committed and one of the key reasons behind Chelsea’s fantastic start.

Vincent Kompany (Manchester City) 

He has suffered with some injury niggles but Kompany is still a supreme defender. More than that, his qualities as a man are so impressive. 

He carries himself and his club with dignity and is a class act on and off the pitch. 

Despite injury problems, Vincent Kompany has shown this season that he is still a top class defender

Leighton Baines (Everton) 

His team might be struggling for form, but Baines is still my top left back. He put his World Cup disappointment behind him and has attacked with great freedom for Everton this season.

Midfield

Eden Hazard (Chelsea) 

He’s like a boxer you just can’t hit. Hazard is so fast and tricky and he is now dictating games. He decides when he wants to go past defenders — they have no say in the matter. 

When he is at his best, as he has been so far this season, Eden Hazard is almost unplayable for a defender

Hazard has scored six Premier League goals already this season, and is one of Chelsea's main threats

Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea) 

I was surprised to see him move to Chelsea, but he has been sensational. There is a great simplicity to his passing game and he is playing the best football of his career. 

Even after time at Barcelona, this team give him the best options he’s ever had. 

Cesc Fabregas is enjoying life at Chelsea, conducting things from midfield with options all around him

Nemanja Matic (Chelsea) 

Matic perfectly understands his role in this Chelsea team. He is good in possession but knows the value of getting back to slam the door shut. His defensive platform allows Chelsea’s attackers to do what they do best. 

Sitting in front of Chelsea's back four, Nemanja Matic gives his team-mates the platform to build from

Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) 

When he plays on the left, the picture is clearer for him — he cuts inside so well and his work-rate is infectious. With that he has great quality and has scored important goals. 

Since joining from Barcelona, Alexis Sanchez has fast become Arsenal's most important attacking player

Strikers

Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) 

Shifts direction in an instant and his change of pace leaves defenders for dead. He is strong, level-headed and shows perfect balance, physically and mentally. Just behind Costa he would be unstoppable.

Diego Costa (Chelsea) 

A brute of a striker. He doesn’t stand and wait to be kicked — he makes sure he kicks defenders first. He lays down Costa’s law and has adapted perfectly to English football. 

Since arriving from Atletico Madrid, Diego Costa has been something of a goal machine

Costa has netted twelve times in the Premier League since joining Chelsea at the beginning of the season

Manager 

Jose Mourinho (Chelsea) 

Selling David Luiz for £50million is enough to win manager of the year! He saw weaknesses in his team and fixed them in the transfer window. 

Perhaps the only blip was letting go of Frank Lampard. Will he come back to haunt Jose?

Jose Mourinho has put together a strong side with good transfer dealings, and Chelsea are top of the league

Just one Manchester City player features, but which one does Keown pick?
