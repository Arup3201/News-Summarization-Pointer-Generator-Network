Barcelona took a reported £3million hit in the Alexis Sanchez deal because the Arsenal forward preferred a move to the Emirates.

According to Spanish newspaper Sport, Liverpool made a bigger bid for the Chilean star than their Premier League rivals Arsenal, only for the player and Spanish giants to give the green light to a less lucrative move to the Gunners instead.

The 25-year-old allegedly favoured a switch to Arsene Wenger's side over the Reds, with Barcelona agreeing to the switch despite being left out of pocket.

Sanchez has hit the ground running at the Emirates and has smashed 10 goals in his first 15 games for the north Londoners.

Kop legend Jamie Carragher admits Sanchez would have been the perfect replacement for Luis Suarez at Anfield.

The former Liverpool defender told Monday Night Football: 'I'm disappointed he's not at Liverpool. He's looking like he's going to be a star of the Premier League.'
