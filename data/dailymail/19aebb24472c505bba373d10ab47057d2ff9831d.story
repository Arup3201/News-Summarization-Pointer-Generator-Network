Education Secretary Michael Gove yesterday admitted pupils who sat GCSEs this year were treated unfairly  – but insisted he cannot intervene.

He said new-style GCSEs inherited from Labour, which split courses into bite-size modules, were 'not best equipped to ensure that all students could perform well and be treated fairly'.

Pupils starting GCSE courses this month will sit straight exams at the end of two years instead, but one more year group will face the flawed exams first.

Mr Gove also said GCSEs could be 
scrapped by 2015 in favour of new exams modelled on O-levels, designed 
for the 'overwhelming majority', with some pupils sitting them at 17 or 
18 instead of 16.

But he insisted he was unable to step 
in to order the regrading of thousands of exam papers by pupils caught 
up in this year's trouble with GCSE English.

Ofqual, the exams watchdog, admitted in a report last week that grade boundaries were raised for the summer exams.

It insisted, however, that the grades 
awarded to more than 650,000 pupils were fair. But schools claim exam 
boards 'moved the goalposts' mid-way through the year, leaving pupils 
with lower grades than expected.

The Education Secretary was pressed on the GCSE grading fiasco in the Commons yesterday and during a series of interviews.

He told MPs: 'I think it's appropriate
that we all learn lessons about some of the mistakes that were made in 
introducing an examination modular in style, which was not best equipped
to ensure that all students could perform well and be treated fairly.'

Asked to intervene to help pupils this
year, he said: 'If ministers were to interfere, they would be meddling 
where they should not interfere.'

Mr Gove had earlier told BBC Radio 4's
Today programme:  'I think everyone who sat the exam was treated in a 
way that either wasn't fair or appropriate.

'What we need is an exam that
has all the rigour of the old O-level, but which is sat by most 
students.'
