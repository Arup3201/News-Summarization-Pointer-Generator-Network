'You're doing this through text message????'

That was the message 38-year-old Christa M. Clark sent in response to a text message she received from her now-ex-fiancee, Buffalo, New York, restaurateur Louis J. Billittier Jr., when he ended their 14-month engagement via-text in July of 2012.

But the message Billittier sent next ended up costing him the $53,000 engagement ring he bought for his now-jilted ex-fiancee.

Prenup: Billittier called off his engagement to Christa Clark (pictured) after the 38-year-old nail technician refused to sign a prenuptial agreement

A New York State Supreme Court judge last week awarded Clark - a nail technician who met Billittier at golf tournament in 2009 - the white gold, 2.97-carat diamond ring, or its fair, market value, based on a text Billittier sent Clark after their breakup, in which he referred to the pricy ring as a 'parting ring,' implying that it was a gift.

Billttier reportedly ended the engagement after his much-younger would-be-bride refused to sign a prenuptial agreement.

However, Clark's attorney, Beverly Braun, tells MailOnline that isn't true.

'[Clark] did agree to the prenup,' Braun says.

When asked why Billittier ended the engagement - if Clark agreed to the prenup - Braun said she '[doesn't] want to speculate.'

'The decision speaks for itself,' she said.

Billittier's attorney, Richard Sullivan, tells MailOnline that he is 'surprised [Braun] would even say something like that' when told that Braun claims her client agreed to sign the prenup. However, Sullivan says his client has 'no reaction to the [judge's] ruling.'

Under the law, courts are typically inclined to side with the groom in disputes over engagement rings - legally, the groom is still entitled to the ring, even if he is the one who calls off the wedding. And just weeks after calling off the wedding - and despite his assurance that it was a 'parting ring' - the 55-year-old co-owner of Buffalo's Chef's Restaurant wanted the ring back.

However, because Billittier responded to Clark's outrage over being dumped in a text message by telling her 'plus you get a $50,000 parting ring. Enough for a down payment on a house,' Judge Russell P. Buscaglia ruled that the ring had become a gift, and was no longer part of a contract for marriage.

Ladies man: Billittier claimed that the text calling the ring a 'parting ring' was a joke, like a game-show contestant's parting gift

Just weeks after ending their engagement, Billittier began sending Clark text messages threatening to take back the ring if she continued to insult him following the breakup.

'Keep it up, and I will take back the ring as well,' he wrote in one text message dated July 20, 2012.

After deciding he wanted the ring back, Billittier sent Clark a text message stating that 'by law have to give it back. You’re nowhere near the person I thought you were. You don’t deserve it.'

In his ruling, Judge Buscaglia said that messages were further proof that 'the ring had been re-gifted,' according to BuffaloNews.com.

The judge found that Billittier's text messages demanding the ring back indicated that he was suffering from 'giver's remorse,' but that didn't mean he was entitled to the ring.

The law typically favors the groom in disputes over engagement rings, even if it is he who calls off the wedding

'Many gifts are given for reasons that sour with the passage of time,' Buscaglia said in his ruling.

However, gift law doesn't entitle to the gifter to recoup the gift just because feelings have changed, Buscaglia ruled.

'Once a gift is given, it is irrevocable,' the judge concluded.

Of the text referring to the 'parting ring' - the text that ultimately cost him more than $50,000 - Billittier claimed in court that he meant it as a joke.

'I was being sarcastic, like a game show host – you get a parting gift,' Billittier said.
