The father of Mohammed Emwazi is not sure that his son is masked Islamic State butcher Jihadi John, his lawyer has said.

Jasem Emwazi, 51, feels there is 'no proof' that the black-clad knife-wielding man featured in chilling hostage execution videos is his eldest child, it was reported today.

His Kuwaiti lawyer, Salem Al-Hashah, told Kuwait's respected Al-Qabas newspaper: 'He is not sure that he [Jihadi John] is his son.

'There is no proof that the man shown in the videos and photographs is his son, as the media has reported in the last few days.'

'No proof': Jasem Emwazi, 51,  said that he was not convinced the Islamic State executioner was his eldest child Mohammed, according to his lawyer

He added: 'There is no evidence that Mohammed is the man in the videos because his face was covered.'

The lawyer's comments appear to contradict earlier remarks made by Mr Emwazi, who is said to have told a colleague that his son is 'a dog, an animal, a terrorist' and called for him to be killed.

Mr Emwazi, who moved to the UK from his native Kuwait in 1994 and holds a British passport, was seen in public for the first time today since he was questioned by Kuwaiti police at the weekend about his son's activities.

A Kuwaiti journalist present at a meeting in his lawyer's office in the upmarket Salmiya district of Kuwait said Mr Emwazi looked 'very scared' and was shaking.

Mr Al-Hashah said the father is not responsible for what his son has done and that there is nothing to prove his father agreed with his son, or helped him in any way. 

The lawyer added: 'Jasem Emwazi is under stress. Many people are calling him names. He can't leave his home and can't walk outside. He is scared of people because everyone believes all the rumours that have been written about him.'

Mr Al-Hashah said Kuwaiti police called Mr Emwazi at the weekend and he was interviewed by officers for two to three hours before being allowed to go without any restrictions. 

The lawyer said no foreign intelligence services have tried to contact Mr Emwazi since his 26-year-old son was identified as Jihadi John last week.

Mr Al-Hashah said Mr Emwazi and his eldest daughter Asma, 25, are currently in Kuwait. His wife Ghaneya, 47, and other children are in Britain.

He said Asma, who studied architecture at university in London, has denied reports that there are other extremists in her family.

The lawyer for Mr Emwazi, a former London taxi driver, said the family was under great stress and that they were not responsible for Jihadi John's actions

The lawyer insisted that Mr Emwazi does not have a job in Kuwait - although MailOnline yesterday spoke to three colleagues who said he is employed as the manager of a co-operative farm supplies depot near the Iraqi border.  

Mr Al-Hashah said he is in Kuwait temporarily to visit his mother and his daughter and had been in the country since November 30.

Mr Emwazi now intends to sue media outlets and social media users who have damaged his family's reputation, his lawyer said. 

'I have a message to the Kuwaiti people that many of the rumours are false,' he told the daily. 

Media and experts identified Emwazi as the ISIS militant believed to be responsible for beheading at least five Westerners. A recent film is believed to show Emwazi shortly after he arrived in Syria in 2013 (pictured)

'Because I felt that some people have believed it, I have assigned a lawyer to defend me and to prove ... that what is being said is untrue,' he said.

It was not clear why he appeared to be retracting statements reported earlier that he and his wife had recognised their son's voice.

His lawyer Salem al-Hashash said he would from Sunday file lawsuits against those who made accusations against Emwazi senior and his family.

Hashash said his client was interrogated by the interior ministry for three hours and released.

A lawyer had been appointed in Britain to defend family members there, Hashash said.

Mohammed Emwazi, the alleged executioner, was born in Kuwait to a stateless family of Iraqi origin. His parents moved to Britain in 1993 after their hopes of obtaining Kuwaiti citizenship were quashed.

Emwazi visited Kuwait several times, the last time between January 18 and April 26, 2010, Al-Qabas said.

A year later, he was denied entry to Kuwait after his name came up during investigations into attacks in Britain.

Media and experts have identified Emwazi as the Islamic State group militant believed to be responsible for beheading at least five Westerners.
