A care home has been closed after an inspection discovered that elderly and vulnerable residents were living in horrifying states of neglect.

Ladymead Nursing Home in Bolton, Lancashire, has been told it must make significant improvements to its dilapidated building before it can be re-opened after it was discovered pensioners had to wear coats inside to keep warm.

Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission made an unannounced visit at the property where they discovered one resident had not had her hair washed for four months.

Another was found to have bedsores that were so bad they graded them level as level four - the most severe type of ulcer that risks life-threatening infections.

Horrifying conditions: Vulnerable residents at the Ladymead Nursing Home in Bolton were left living out of suitcases and sitting in their coats to keep warm

Bedrooms had 'poor' odour control and residents at the care home had to use their commodes as seats.

Residents from Ladymead were moved into temporary accommodation in January following the CQC inspection and Icon Healthcare has been told it must make health and safety improvements.

It was also found that two residents sharing a room were forced to live out of suitcases because they were not provided with wardrobes.

Another two people were classed as needing bed care but another two were left in their beds because the home did not have the means to take them to the lounge.

Bedrooms had faulty electrical items and broken equipment, and bathrooms were cluttered with zimmer frames, mops and ladders.

Inspectors found thin bedding, curtains 
hanging off the rails, fraying carpets, water damage to ceilings 
following a 'flood' and a mattress 'heavily stained with brown marks'.

The report showed that the home's Public Liability Insurance had expired a month earlier, that its gas certificate was out-of-date by four years and its manager, who had been in post for 11 months, had not registered with the CQC.

The maintenance cellar, containing the electric circuit box, was damp, and had water seeping in from outside.

A fire officer highlighted the 'inadequate' fire detection system and electrical system.

The medicine was overstocked, unlocked and left near a radiator, while the home's records were incomplete.

Ladymead advertises itself as a 'small family-run 
residential and nursing home' aiming to provide a 'warm, caring environment'.

A report detailing the improvements to be taken was due to be sent to the CQC by yesterday.

A CQC spokesman said: 'We continue to work closely with Bolton Council and NHS Bolton to ensure all areas of concern are addressed before any decision is made to move residents back in.'

The owners were unavailable for comment.
