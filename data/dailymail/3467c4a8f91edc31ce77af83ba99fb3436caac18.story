Female techies have continued making inroads into the male-dominated realm of Silicon Valley, capturing two additional spots on this year's Forbes' list of the world's most powerful women.

In 2014, seven women working in technology made it into the top 25 - up from five the year before - including Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg at No 9, IBM's first-ever female chairman and CEO Ginni Rometty rounding out the top 10, Yahoo's Marissa Mayer in the 18th spot, followed by Hewlett Packard's Meg Whitman.

Among the 18 female leaders in technology there were a few new faces this year, such as the recently named CEO of YouTube Susan Wojcicki who debuted at No 12, Cher Wang, co-founder of the Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer HTC, and Cisco's Chief Technology and Strategy Officer Padmasreee Warrior.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel continued to dominate the rundown, landing the No 1 spot on the Forbes list for the ninth time.

In the U.S. political circles, former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton slid from fourth rank down to sixth since last year.

The Forbes article described the 66-year-old former first lady as ‘one of the most-watched-and-listened-to women on the planet’ who is primed to become the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate. 

The current first lady, Michelle Obama, once again finished behind her predecessor, landing in No 8 spot.

Janet Yellen, the new Federal Reserve chair and first woman to hold the high post, made a strong debut on the Forbes list at No. 2 behind Merkel, followed by philanthropist Melinda Gates, co-chair of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Mrs Gates was also one of eight women who appeared on Forbes' inaugural list in 2004, which also included other mainstays like Queen Elizabeth II, Mrs Clinton, media tycoon Oprah Winfrey and managing director of International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde.

Of the 100 leading ladies on the 2014 rundown, 18 were newcomers, among them Lucy Peng, CEO of Chinese search giant Alibaba, Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power.

Nearly 50 per cent of the women on the list were trailblazers: Liberia's first female President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf; Harvard University President CEO Drew Gilpin, GM's new CEO Mary Barra and Sara Blakely, founder and CEO of Spanx, who became the first female self-made billionaire to sign The Giving Pledge - a commitment by the world's wealthiest people to give away most of their money to charity.

That's a first: Sara Blakely, founder and CEO of Spanx, and at age 43 the youngest female self-made billionaire, became the first businesswoman to sign The Giving Pledge

Although Forbes' compilation of the most powerful women is international, more than 50 per cent of the female political, business, entertainment, technology and philanthropy leaders hailed from the U.S. 

The 2014 Most Powerful Women list featured nine heads of state who run nations with a combined GDP of $11.1trillion. The 28 corporate CEOs control $1.7trillion in annual revenues, and 18 of the women founded their own companies.

Aha moment: Media tycoon Oprah Winfrey slid from No 13 in 2013 down to 14

Shining stars: Beyonce Knowles  (left) remained in the 17th place on the Forbes list, Modern Family's Sofia Vergara (center) was ranked 32nd, and Angelina Jolie (right) rounded out the top 50

So far, 2014 has been a banner year for female entertainers, with Beyonce staying put at No 17 - the highest in the category - followed by Modern Family's Sofia Vergara at No 32 and Maleficence star Angelina Jolie closing out the top 50.

Jill Abramson, who in 2012 was in the top
 five, was omitted from the list this year after being fired by the New 
York Times just over two years after becoming the paper's first female executive
 editor.
