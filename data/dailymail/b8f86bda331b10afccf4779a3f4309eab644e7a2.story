A Boston woman has launched a new healthy chocolate company which specializes in healthy, vegan treats, which are targeted at women suffering from pre-menstrual sugar cravings. 

Tania Green, the creator of the gluten-free, all-natural, vegan PMS Bites, has turned to crowdsourcing website Kickstarter in order to fund her new food-focused venture - and has already managed to raise more than $5,000 in just ten hours. 

'We have all been there: boobs swell, stomach bloats, feelings hurt, friends and significant others become annoying, work becomes overwhelming, and the only relief seems to be a pound of chocolate and a good cry,' she said on the site.

Entrepreneurial talent: Tania Green, from Boston, came up with the idea for PMS Bites after struggling with her own PMS-related sugar cravings

Healthy treats: The chocolate bites contain only all-natural ingredients and are gluten-free

'Pre-menstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a real problem—and it bites. Eighty to ninety percent of women suffer from PMS, and thirty to forty percent find symptoms debilitating enough to interfere with their everyday lives.'

After struggling through years of unwanted PMS-related symptoms herself, including violent mood swings, fatigue, bloating and persistent food cravings, Tania decided to take matters into her own hands and implement a number of lifestyle changes which she hoped would help her to conquer the impact of her monthly cycle. 

'I asked myself how I could fix this huge problem in my life,' she explained in her PMS Bites video ad. 'I exercised more, even when I didn't feel like it, I would eat healthier, drink way less caffeine and get a ton of sleep.

'All of those things worked, but cravings sucked the most. I would reach for cookies, brownies, and, while it satisfied me in the moment, later on I would feel guilty and my energy would drop.'

Combat your cravings: Each of the chocolate-based bites has its own clever name, including Plain Crazy (pictured) which is Tania's original creation

Something exotic: Coco-Nutty is a chocolate bite which has been dusted with 'fluffy coconut' 

That's nutty! All Kinds of Nuts features chocolate, oats and pecans 

With a lack of readily available healthy treats in her cupboards, the entrepreneur decided to concoct the ideal antidote to her seemingly endless food cravings herself, focusing on healthy, natural ingredients which would create a delicious delicacy - without the added sugar and calories. 

'I went into my kitchen one day and threw a bunch of stuff into a bowl,' she added. 'Dates, cocoa powder, oats; I wanted it to be as healthy as possible. 

'I started to experiment, and after a lot of trial and error - I mean a lot of hours in the kitchen - I bit into this thing and thought, "my god, finally, a treat that I can crave, enjoy, and feel no regrets".'

And in addition to the more basic ingredients, which also include pecans and coconut, Tania also created her own special blend of herbs, which she believes will help women to combat any other unwelcome symptoms of PMS.

Bad times: Tania explained that, in the lead up to her monthly cycle, she often found herself lusting after fatty foods, such as pizza and ice cream

All-natural: Tania's PMS Bites use completely natural ingredients, providing a healthy option for anyone who suffers from sugar cravings 

'The bites also contain dandelion root, Siberian ginseng, and chamomile,' the product description explains. 'Studies have shown these ingredients may be good for bloating, every day stress, and irritability.'

Tania's PMS Bites are currently available in three flavors, all of which have been given a suitably hormonal moniker.

Plain Crazy is the original Bite and is described as being 'crafted with premium fair-trade cocoa powder and hearty oats', while Coco-Nutty comes complete with a 'generous sprinkling on fluffy coconut' and All Kinds of Nuts - unsurprisingly - have been rolled in pecans. 

Thus far, Tania's Kickstarter campaign has raised just under $5,400 in less than 12 hours - nearly $400 above her initial fundraising target. Her aim is to have an official PMS Bites kitchen up and running by March, with the first batch of orders - which can be made as monthly subscriptions timed to arrive at the perfect moment - due to be shipped in April.
