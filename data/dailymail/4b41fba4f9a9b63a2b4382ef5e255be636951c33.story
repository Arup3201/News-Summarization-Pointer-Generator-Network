U.S. President Barack Obama delivers remarks about the launch of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces

As many as 11 million employees of small businesses in the U.S. face paying more for health insurance under Obamacare, according to a new report into the controversial healthcare bill.

The estimate, provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services (CMS), part of the Department of Health and Human Services, also projected that 6 million others face lower rates for health insurance.

The report says that this is due to the to the laws requirement that premiums for health insurance can no longer be based on an insurance applicant's age. 

This means that while older people's premiums are going down, younger people's are going to rise.

While the estimate is far from certain, because many small businesses renewed their insurance policies in 2013.

Because they renewed before 2014, they were allowed to avoid higher premiums that went into effect, when insurance coverage was required to conform to the new law, on January 1.

The estimate is also affected by the report only looking at three specific provisions of the Affordable Care Act.

In actuality, employers decisions will be based on more than just three factors, according to information from the CMS.

The news that premiums could increase for 11 million could be good news for the Republican party, who have made anti-Obamacare campaigning their number one priority and policy.

Obamacare has been rife with problems ever since it was signed into law in March 2010.

A typical U.S. insurance site, that allows citizens to sign up for medical and health insurance. Under Obamacare, the rules that exist to help them sign up are different in a way that tries to benefit those on lower incomes

Public polls suggest that the U.S. citizenship generally support Obamacare, but recent and frequent damaging mistakes and errors in its implementation have given the Republican party, who strongly oppose the legislation, ammo against it in their campaigns.

Recently, errors in signing up to Obamacare using the website was fraught with error, as the site appeared to be repeatedly broken, prompting people to have to use the mobile site if they wanted to sign up. 

This, combined with low turnout for signing up in states such as Oregon, which signed up only 33, 808 instead of a projected 146,940, has given the public pause for thought when decided where their allegiances lie.

However, despite these mistakes, many governors, both Republican and Democrats
 alike, have come to the conclusion that 'Obamacare is here to stay' 
taking a more 'pragmatic view' of the healthcare legislation.

'We're
 just trying to make the best of a bad situation' said Republican Gov. 
Terry Branstad of Iowa, who called the health care law 'unaffordable and
 unsustainable'.

Representative Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado, displays an advertisement from the Thanks Obamacare campaign, an anti-obamacare campaign. Republicans have been widely critical of the new healthcare legislation

He said: 'We're trying to make it work as best we can for the people of Iowa.'

Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana said: 'I don't think that it's so deeply entrenched that it can't be repealed.'

'But I do think, as we argue for repeal, we have to show folks what you replace it with.'

However,
 despite a troubled introduction, nearly 3.3 million people have signed 
up by February 1 for health care coverage under the law.

In addition, the White House reported that 1 million people signed up nationwide for private insurance under the law in January alone.

But it still remains unclear whether the administration will reach its unofficial goal of 7 million people by the end of March.

 'Obamacare' is the name given to 
the Patient Care and Affordable Health Act, legislation that is an 
attempt to make healthcare in the U.S, which can often be very 
expensive, affordable for those on lower incomes.

Healthcare in the U.S. is based around the purchase of health insurance, which, before now, was able to make it expensive for people, or even deny people their services on the basis of factors like age or pre-existing medical conditions.

Without medical insurance, citizens in the U.S. have to pay for their own medical care which can be incredibly expensive (a single hospital visit can cost $1,265).

A few basic rules under the act are:

11 million small business employees could pay more, 6 million pay less

@highlight

It won't affect people until next year, businesses renewed at end of 2013

@highlight

Disparity due to law saying insurance premiums can't be based on age

@highlight

Older people will likely pay less and younger people will likely pay more
