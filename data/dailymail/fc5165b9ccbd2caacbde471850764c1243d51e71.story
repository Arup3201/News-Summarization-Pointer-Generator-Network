The man charged with funding terrorism after Tuesday's early morning raids had been under surveillance for more than eight months.

Hassan El Sabsabi was arrested at his home in Seabrook, Melbourne after AFP officers were tipped off by their FBI counterparts that he was allegedly sending money to an American fighter in Syria.

The 23 year old appeared in Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday afternoon charged with six counts of intentionally making funds available to a terrorist organisation.

Around 25,000 pages from social media accounts and 500 telephone calls and messages will have to be analysed as part of the case against the accused, the court heard.

A 23-year-old Seabrook man has been charged with making funds available to a terrorist organisation

The man was arrested in Seabrook on Tuesday morning following terror raids across five suburbs in Melbourne - Seabrook, Meadow Heights, Flemington, Kealba and Broadmeadows

The 23-year-old Seabrook man appeared at the the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday afternoon

Police said earlier that about $12,000 had allegedly been provided to a man in the United States, allowing him to join terrorist militants in Syria some months ago, where he continues to fight there.

Prosecutor Andrew Doyle was granted more time to prepare his brief of evidence against El Sabsabi because of the volume of material, a lot of which needs to be transcribed and in some cases translated.

'A substantial amount of material will be sourced from overseas,' Mr Doyle told the court.

El Sabsabi's lawyer Trieu Huynh asked for his client to be transferred from the Melbourne Custody Centre to the Melbourne Assessment Prison as soon as possible. He is due to reappear on February 3.

'Given the nature of the charges (and) it's his first time in custody, it's extremely onerous on him,' he said. He also asked for a doctor to examine his client as soon as possible for his medical conditions, which Mr Huynh said he would not outline in open court.

Police said the joint Australian Federal Police and Victoria Police counter terrorism raids in Seabrook, Meadow Heights, Flemington, Kealba and Broadmeadows on Tuesday were not related to last week's incident in Endeavour Hills in which an alleged terrorist was shot dead.

Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said police took action because they believed more money was about to be sent to the US citizen, who has been fighting in Syria for several months.

'We are of the view that further funds were about to be transferred to this person in Syria, so today was about an overt action to resolve this matter,' he said.

The 23-year-old man will appear before Melbourne Magistrates Court this afternoon. 

In parliament Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australians who fund terrorists are complicit in their 'dreadful deeds'.

Mr Abbott said the anti-money laundering agency Austrac had been given an extra $20 million to help track down terrorist funding.

Federal cabinet has yet to give final approval for a combat mission in Iraq to fight Islamic State.

But Mr Abbott said that subject to cabinet consideration 'our objective is to support governments that don't commit genocide against their own people, nor allow their territory to support terrorism against our people'. 

ASIO will brief state and territory attorneys-general and police ministers at a meeting in Geelong on Friday on the national security threat. Australian Federal Police officers will also brief the meeting on recent raids.

On Tuesday, more than 100 police officers executed seven search warrants simultaneously across Melbourne at 6.45am.

There is no intelligence to indicate the 23-year-old arrested man was planning a terrorist attack and police believe he was acting alone, Assistant Commissioner Gaughan said. 

Assistant Commissioner Gaughan said  police executed  six more search warrants at residences outside Seabrook to gain evidence in relation to the charges against the man.

'There is no suggestion at this stage that those people were involved in any criminality,' he said.

A large amount of electronic evidence was seized, which will be analysed by investigators over the next few months.

The searches that were conducted were done 'in a far more low-key manner' than other recent terror raids in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Graham Ashton said.

'This is a terrorism financing case, we didn't assess there being a significant community safety risk or a significant risk to our officers,' he said. 

The 23-year-old man was arrested on Point Cook Road opposite Seabrook Primary School.

He is believed to be a pizza shop worker in his 20s, 3AW reported.  

Neighbour Sandeep Singh, 32, saw the man arrested and taken away in a car. 

'I've seen him but never spoken to him,' Mr Singh told Daily Mail Australia.

'He was alright, says hello and that's it.'

Mr Singh said it was 'a bit scary' to see counter terrorism activity on his street. 

Another neighbour Here Du Buisson Perrine, 71, said the arrested man moved into the home with his wife in December.

'He has an Aussie accent. I would think he was born in Australia,' Mr Du Buisson Perrine told The Australian. 

Mr Du Buisson Perrine added that the man was Muslim, and that the pair spoke almost every day.

'I've heard him praying once or twice, but only very quietly,' he said.

'He likes gardening. I've given him advice about his lemon trees. He's a very friendly, very nice guy.'  

Victorian Premier Denis Napthine said he was briefed by police as Tuesday's raids started and was told they were part of a long-running and ongoing counter-terrorism operation. 

'They are not about a specific threat or there is certainly no immediate concern for public safety,' Dr Napthine told 3AW. 

 

The premier also urged the community to be tolerant and come together at this time, and said law enforcement was 'ahead of the game' in combating the risk of terrorism.

'It's a sad situation that we now face, but we can have confidence in the work of ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the VicPol. They do a terrific job,' Dr Napthine said. 

This comes after the two police officers stabbed last week before the fatal shooting of an alleged terrorist at Endeavour Hills  released a statement.

'We would like to thank our family, friends, colleagues and everyone who has helped and supported us through this difficult time,' they said. 

'We are both holding up well and appreciate everyone's kind thoughts and well wishes. We ask that our privacy is respected while we continue to recover.'

Police fatally shot Numan Haider outside the Endeavour Hills police station where it was arranged they would meet the 18-year-old after conducting raids on his home Tuesday morning. 

It was agreed that Haider would greet a Victoria Police senior constable and a 43-year-old AFP officer cordially on Tuesday night.

Seconds after meeting the 18-year-old he took out a weapon and repeatedly stabbed both officers.

He was then killed by a single shot. 

On Tuesday, Deputy Commissioner Ashton said Haider's family received death threats in the days after his death, which was concerning.

He stressed Haider's family had nothing to do with the incident involving the 18-year-old.

'Family, particularly the parents of the young man, received death threats over the weekend,' he told reporters.

'This is an innocent family.

'I think the fact they received those deaths threats last week is very disappointing.'
