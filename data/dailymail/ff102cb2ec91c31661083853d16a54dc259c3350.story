Sam Allardyce collected the Barclays Manager of the Month accolade on Friday and then advised rival Paul Lambert to take a holiday during next week's international break.

The West Ham boss, who faces Aston Villa's Lambert at Upton Park on Saturday, shared one of the secrets of his success: 'Get out of the country in an international break. Re-focus your mind and body so you're ready for the next phase.'

In a double boost for West Ham, Allardyce's achievement was matched by Senegal striker Diafra Sakho, who scooped the Player of the Month prize.

The award for Allardyce, 60, represents a remarkable turnaround for the manager who was booed and jeered by many West Ham fans last season for what they took as unimaginative boring football, and an uninspired final 13th place finish in the table. 

West Ham have been a different side this season playing with an attractive attacking style and verve often associated with the club in the past -- but not for many years.

Allardyce told Sky Sports: 'The most pleasing thing of all is that we have managed to pull all the new players together and fitted them into a team that is playing very well at the moment and enjoying their football and getting some exceptionally good results.'

West Ham are currently fifth in the standings and beat Queens Park Rangers, Burnley and champions Manchester City during October before coming from two goals down to force a 2-2 draw at Stoke City last weekend.
