The ‘world's best life-dog’ has been donated a bespoke wet shoe after an injury to his gargantuan foot threatened to end his career.

Whizz the Newfoundland hero, who is 13 stone and 6ft tall, can save up to a dozen people at a time on rescue missions in Clapton-in-Gordano, Somerset.

The pooch has webbed paws that help him glide through the waves in emergency situations - but a severe gash from glass forced him out of action.

However a Canadian company which designs state-of-the-art wetsuits had a specially-made glove flown in to help Whizz carry on his life-saving duties.

Owner David Pugh, who has raised Whizz from a pup, said: ‘Whizz cut his foot on some glass and couldn't swim in case it became infected.

‘But he was desperate to return to help. It's one of those small things that could grow and become a lot worse. I couldn't take the risk.

‘A company in Canada who specialises in making these kind of things had one specially sent over to help him. It's just a remarkably generous thing to do.

'Now Whizz in back to his best. He's immensely strong and eats as much as an adult man - he's a local celebrity.’

Whizz's
popularity has led people to dub him the world's best life-dog - and 
his heroics have even been hailed by Baywatch legend David Hasselhoff.

David Pugh, owner of Whizz

He lives with Mr Pugh, who has kept Newfoundland dogs for more than 25 years.

He said: ‘When people hear that he 
can save dogs they don't believe it - until they see him in action and 
he's absolutely amazing.

'They're completely blown away. The crowds also love them because they are very photogenic dogs.’

Big jump: The reason the dogs are so tough is because of their inhospitable homeland of Newfoundland in Canada, Whizz's owner David Pugh added

He added: ‘Ellie's become such a confident person because of Whizz, and Whizz has become such an incredible dog because of Ellie.

David Pugh, owner of Whizz

‘The two are fantastic together - they're made for one another.’

The reason the dogs are so tough is because of their inhospitable homeland of Newfoundland in Canada, Mr Pugh added.

Mr Pugh said: ‘It is a very bleak and austere climate out there - I went in the summer once and it was -7C, so you have to be tough.

‘These dogs had to be useful so would help the local fishermen get the nets in.’

He set up Newfound Friends in 1990, using the dogs to raise money for charity and help sick children. So far the dogs have raised more than £750,000.
