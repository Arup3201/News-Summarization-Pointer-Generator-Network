It might be time to throw away your old pen and paper - Esquoia claims to offer a 'revolutionary' approach to writing with an innovative design.

The reusable notebook allows you to jot down notes and then wipe pages clean without residual smudging or ink.

And what’s more, it is water resistant and you can also transfer entire pages between books.

A group of past and present Bradford University students are hoping to revolutionise the stationery world with an invention named Esquoia. The reusable notebook has pages similar to a whiteboard that can be wiped clean and written on again after they are used

Esquoia is the work of a team of Bradford University students.

Reusable - Write, dry-erase and rewrite things many times.

Effective - Erase unnecessary things instantly and re-draw.

Durable - Strong materials - use the same notebook for many years.

Customizable - Reposition pages fast; change rings and covers.

Printer-friendly - Make copies of a single sheet.

Environmentally friendly - Consume less paper for lengthy note-making.

To enable a proper launch of their project they are currently seeking funds on Kickstarter.

And having now reached their target, money is continuing to flock in as they prepare to bring Esquoia to market.

The product is inspired by whiteboard designs, bringing ‘flexible whiteboard features to a single desk notebook,’ says the company.

The specially designed paper is similar to laminated paper with a smooth surface.

When written on the pages can easily be scrubbed clean with a pencil eraser, a napkin or even a wet cloth.

And the unique binder design also enables pages to be taken out of one notebook and placed in another.

The paper is inspired by whiteboards. It is similar to laminated paper and, with special dry-erase ink pens, it can be written on and then wiped clean with ease. The design lets writers and illustrators reuse the same page over and over again without any markings or ink staying on the page after the ink has been erased

The ink on each page of the notebook can be rubbed off the page using anything from a standard eraser to a wet cloth. Here Chemistry student Anna Jaskova from the University of Bradford is seen demonstrating how the reusable notebook works

‘The first prototypes were single sheets of basic laminated paper,’ the company writes.

‘It was far from a beautiful notebook, but the start was already there.

‘The very first prototype was just a plain sheet of laminated paper. It was not user-friendly enough for comfortable everyday use.

‘We went further and had fun trying out mountains of different special types of paper.

‘We continued the trial-and-error process with another bunch of paper arranged with a local printing shop on campus, as well as many other producers of paper.

‘Finally, we came up with a smooth, high-quality surface. It provided an exciting and different writing experience.

‘Our collection of mini whiteboards was thus created.’

The notebooks will come in a variety of colours. They also have a unique binder design that allows the reusable pages to be easily transferred between notebooks, even if the pages are different sizes

With funding the team plans to upgrade the next-generation notebook even further.

Amongst several novel ideas, they plan to produce sheets of paper with lines or grids for other uses.

They also want to create larger pages that will include a ‘folding line’ where they could be torn.

‘We believe In our notebooks and we are committed to the idea by developing it on a daily basis,’ the team says.

‘We want to make people start sketching and/or making notes in a way they never did before.’

The Esquoia notebooks were designed and made by a team of students from the University of Bradford, who now hope to bring the product to market with sufficient funding. Pictured are two of the team, Valdemar Tunkevic (left) and Dontas Beksa (24), right
