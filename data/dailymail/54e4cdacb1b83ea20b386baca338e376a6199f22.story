Britain's Paralympic team have yet another medal to add to their record-breaking haul after cyclist David Stone took gold this morning.

The 30-year-old successfully defended his Paralympic Games title with victory in the mixed T1-2 road race at Brands Hatch.

He was left disappointed with bronze on Wednesday after relinquishing his time-trial title. But Stone, who has cerebral palsy and rides a tricycle, bounced back in the 24-kilometre road race to win his third Paralympic gold medal, seven seconds ahead of Italy's Giorgio Farroni.

Oscar Pistorius, beaten by GB's Jonnie Peacock in a thrilling 100m final on Thursday, will provide the final showpiece as he competes in the 400m this evening.

His appearance will be the final race in the stadium, which has seen some incredible performances over the last nine days.

The
 South African prompted a fierce debate after criticising the length of 
Alan Oliveira's blades during his 200m defeat on Sunday.

He
 tweeted yesterday: 'Looking forward to stepping out tonight and 
tomorrow for my last and favourite event, The Quarter-400m! The Final 
event of London 2012.'

The British gold rush is expected to continue tomorrow as David Weir competes in the London wheelchair marathon.

Weir,
 33, known as The Weirwolf of London, won the 800m gold in a sensational
 performance on Thursday as the raucous crowd sang along to his 
trademark song Werewolves Of London.

Fans will again be howling with delight as they line the city's streets to cheer him on to a quadruple gold crown.

Peacock, 19, elevated himself to greatness after flying to victory in the 100m final.

Channel
 4 said a record audience of more than six million tuned in to watch the
 athlete's win - the biggest of the Paralympics so far.

Simmonds broke her own world record - which she set in the qualifiers - to take gold number two

It
 smashed the previous highest for a live event, which was 4.4 million 
for Sunday's 200m race in which Pistorius lost to Brazilian Alan 
Oliveira.

Josie Pearson, 26, yesterday won Britain's 32nd of the games in the discus final.

The
 Bristol-born athlete was just 17 and a promising showjumper when in 
2003 she was left paralysed in a car crash that broke her vertebrae.

Tomorrow
 a dramatic closing ceremony will bring the curtain down on what has 
undoubtedly been one of the most successful Paralympics ever.

Stars including Jay-Z and Rihanna will appear at the event, which has been shrouded in mystery.

Coldplay are also set to perform at the ceremony, which is sold out and expected to be watched by millions world-wide.

British stars of the Olympics and Paralympics will them celebrate their summer of success during a victory parade through the streets of London on Monday.
