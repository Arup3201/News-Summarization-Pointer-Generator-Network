He may have recently been named the richest man in America for the 18th consecutive year, but for Bill Gates a hamburger is still a hamburger.

The Microsoft co-founder, and man with a $59billion wealth, told students during a talk at the University of Washington in Seattle, that beyond a certain point, it all tastes the same.

His words came as Sean Parker, the Napster founder and former Facebook president who has a $2.1bn fortune, complained of having added worries now he is rich and questioned whether life was better before.

Keen listeners: Gates had been asked by a student at the university's Seattle campus how to get rich like him

Asked by a student for advice on how to become as rich as him, 56-year-old Gates replied, according to geekwire.com: 'I didn't start out with dream of being super-rich.

'Even after we started Microsoft we looked at guys running Intel and thought, wow, that must be strange (to be rich). It is, sort of strange.

'Wealth above a certain level is a responsibility to leave to children, which may or may not be good for them, or figure out how to give it away.

'I can understand wanting to have millions of dollars, there's a certain freedom, meaningful freedom, that comes with that.

'But once you get much beyond that, I have to tell you, it's the same hamburger.'

Referring to a Seattle-area fast-food chain he added: 'Dick's has not raised their prices enough. But being ambitious is good. You just have to pick what you enjoy doing.'

In 2000, Gates and his wife Melinda combined three family foundations into one to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which funds health and education projects around the world.

It claims to be the biggest philanthropic organisation in the world and currently has more than $25billion in funds.

Gates has promised to transfer 95 per cent of his money to the charity, rather than pass it on to his children.

Meanwhile,
 fellow billionaire Parker has provoked a storm of criticism of Twitter 
after suggesting he had it tough being so wealthy.

After
 declaring he wanted to visit Occupy Wall Street Parker, who wears a 
tuxedo in his profile picture, received a barrage of abuse.

Twitter row: Parker's followers were not too sympathetic to his heart-felt plea over cash troubles

In response the 31-year-old, who has $2.1bn fortune, wrote: 'You guys are really attacking me for being the 1%? I was broke and couch surfing just a few years ago.'

He added: 'I have a whole new set of problems to deal with now: security, extortion attempts, kidnapping threats, death threats, etc. Life better b4?'

Parker, who rents a mansion in Manhattan for $45,000 a month, later stated he was 'working on a plan to give it all away over time'.
