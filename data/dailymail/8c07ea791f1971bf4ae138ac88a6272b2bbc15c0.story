Jonas Bjorkman is the preferred candidate to become Andy Murray's new assistant coach with the Swedish former world No 4 joining the Brit's team for a trial period.

Murray has been searching for a new No 2 coach since Dani Vallverdu left the team last November before going on to work with Czech Tomas Berdych.

Bjorkman will work with Murray for one week in the next month or so once his television commitments with Let's Dance, the Swedish version of Strictly Come Dancing, are over.

The 42-year-old has plenty of experience in the game, reaching the semi-finals at Wimbledon and the US Open and winning nine doubles titles across all four Grand Slams.

Bjorkman tweeted: 'I'm super excited and I'm really looking forward to join @andy_murray and his team for a test week.'

Murray and Bjorkman have played each other on tour once, the former coming out on top in five sets in their second-round clash at the 2007 US Open.Â

Murray is currently in Indian Wells, California with main coach Amelie Mauresmo for the BNP Paribas Open and is scheduled to take on Vasek Pospisil or Mikhail Kukushkin in the second round on Saturday or Sunday.

Speaking before Great Britain's victory against the USA in the Davis Cup last weekend, Murray said: 'After the Aussie Open I spent the next three or four weeks with no coach and I feel that's something I obviously need to get sorted so that when I get to the clay-court season I am not in that position, because I feel like there are some things I need to work on all the time and when I don't have someone there it's harder to do that.'
