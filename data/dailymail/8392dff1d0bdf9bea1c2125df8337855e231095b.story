The Sony hacking scandal continued reverberating throughout the Hollywood film industry on Wednesday as Steve Carell's slated new movie, Pyongyang was canceled.

The announcement was made just hours before Sony scrapped the release of the controversial Seth Rogen comedy The Interview, which was scheduled to premiere Christmas Day.

The studio's decision to cancel the release of the film about a CIA assassination plot targeting North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un was prompted by threatening messages alluding to 9/11-style terrorist attacks against cinemas.

Scrapped: New Regency has canceled the production of a new film about North Korea with the working title Pyongyang based on an eponymous graphic novel by Guy Delisle

Titled Pyongyang, New Regency’s now-defunct film has been described as a thriller based on Guy Delisle's eponymous graphic novel about his experiences living in the totalitarian state, reported The Wrap. 

Steve Conrad had penned the script for the film and it was supposed to be directed by Gore Verbinksi, who was also expected to co-produce the movie through his outfit Blind Wink.

Following the news that Pyongyang has been scrapped, Steve Carell tweeted to his 3.64million followers: ‘Sad day for creative expression,' followed by the hashtag, 'feareatsthesoul.'

A short time later, the former star of The Office tweeted a black-and-white photo of Charlie Chaplin as a fictionalized version of Adolf Hitler in his 1941 classic The Great Dictator.   

Deadline reported the movie was set to begin production in March. Carell, the star of the critically acclaimed thriller Foxcatcher, currently out in theaters, was slated to play an American who is accused of espionage while working in Pyongyang.

While New Regency has not publicly commented on its decision to call off the production of Pyongyang, the timing of the move suggests the studio behind such hits as 12 Years A Slave and Gone Girl has decided not to take any chances in light of the Sony hack.

Guy Delisle became one of the few Westerners to be allowed to enter the secretive community nation, where he stayed for two months while working for a French film animation company.

Over the past two weeks, a shadowy group calling themselves the Guardians of Peace hacked Sony's computer systems releasing 10 years’ worth of emails along with employees' private information like salary figured and social security numbers.

Among the leaked material were dozens of embarrassing exchanges between top executives discussing A-list stars like Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lawrence and Aaron Sorkin.

On Wednesday, the US government confirmed that North Korea was indeed behind the massive hack.

Kim Jon Un's regime has gone on record calling Sony's The Interview an 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war.'

Shut down: The announcement was made just hours after Sony scrapped the release of the controversial Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy The Interview

Thousands of theaters Tuesday announced they won't be showing the comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco 

On Tuesday, thousands of movie theaters across the country announced they will not be showing the film next week, setting the stage for Sony's decision to scrap altogether the release of the movie that cost $42million to make.

‘Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film,' said a spokesperson for the studio Wednesday evening. ‘'In light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film The Interview, we have decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release.’

Almost immediately, many in Hollywood voiced their concern, with writer Aaron Sorkin saying how upset he was that 'the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists,' and director Judd Apatow explaining the many problems this means for films moving forward.

CNN Justice Correspondent Evan Perez said earlier today that government investigators believe that there is no way this cyber-attack on Sony could have been carried out unless it came from the top.

Authorities are also looking into whether or not someone inside Sony helped the hackers.
