Jennifer Aniston continues to expand her empire, releasing her second fragrance ‘J’ this week.

The 45-year-old actress looks stunning on the box of the new scent, which comes in an azure blue bottle.

With her hair teased into slightly damp tresses and a sun-kissed glow, Jennifer captures the beach babe look perfectly.

J by Jennifer Aniston is a clean rather than sweet scent designed for the summer.

Aniston told People: ‘My debut fragrance is a clean, feminine perfume — it reminds me of the way you smell when you just arrive at the beach: fresh, with a touch of sunblock and sand.

‘This new fragrance is its complement. It has a hint of that salty sea smell that reminds me of a day spent in the ocean. It’s relaxed and refreshing.’

Her debut scent Lolavie was launched three years ago and has notes of citrus grove accord, rose water and jasmine.

Rumoured to be on the cusp of marrying her fiance of 23 months Justin Theroux, Jennifer's summer looks set to be jam-packed as she promotes both her new scent and her latest movie Horrible Bosses 2 in which she plays a nymphomaniac employer from hell.

But her career successes have not stopped the endless speculation about her relationship with fellow actor Justin.

Justin, who is currently promoting his new show The Leftovers has recently announced their relationship will remain bi-costal as he plans to continue to split his time between New York and LA, where Jennifer lives.

Despite this, Justin told Extra at the New York premiere of his new HBO series The Leftovers on Monday, that despite rumours their long engagement means they are getting cold feet about tying the knot, they have 'hot feet'.

'We're still happily engaged,' the star continued while keeping a close hold on his 'gorgeous' sweetheart down much of the red carpet.
