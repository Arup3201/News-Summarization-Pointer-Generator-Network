This is the moment a Highways Agency worker got a shock after a parakeet popped up in front of a speed camera - and posed for a selfie.

The brightly coloured bird was captured peering into a camera suspended over one of the UKâ€™s busiest motorways.

It is believed the exotic-looking animal may have got lost along the Midlandsâ€™ myriad of motorways when he found himself on the M6 in Staffordshire.

The Highways Agency spotted the bird at 11am at Junction 16 for Kidsgrove and put it out on their Twitter page.

The picture shows the yellow bird with a red beak striking a pose into the camera while the traffic passes him below.

Spokeswoman Pragati Baddhan said: 'We think this little chap was trying to "tweet" us.'

The birds are thriving in areas of London because of the UKâ€™s warmer winters. Experts believe there could now be as many as 30,000 of them in the capital.

Parakeets, which are not native to Britain, are descended from escapees from zoos and pet shops.

The bird is just the latest in a long line of animals getting in on 2013's biggest craze.

Twitter has been inundated with posts of animals pulling their best poses for the camera next to the hashtag #animalselfies.

And it's not just cats and dogs getting in on the action, with monkeys, horses and even bearded dragons getting involved.

Oxford Dictionary named the 'selfie' as the word of the year, beating tough competition from twerk, binge-watch and showrooming.
