A gay couple have had their dream wedding ruined by a stranger who screamed gay slurs from a nearby apartment complex balcony. 

Oscar De Las Salas and Gary Jackson, who live in Arizona but regularly visit San Diego, California, picked the Centennial Park in Coronado as the perfect spot to celebrate their special day. 

The couple, who have been together for seven years, gathered with their family and friends on August 17 in the public park at sunset by the bay.

However when the ceremony was about to start, a person in an expensive apartment complex close to the park began screaming homophobic slurs. 

The person shouted 'h****', 'go home h****' and 'go home f***' while horrified wedding guests captured the attack on their phones, ABC 23 reported. 

Police said on Tuesday that they are investigating the incident to determine if it is a hate crime.

Mr De Las Salas said during the vows everyone turned around and stared - but it wasn't clear where the horrible abuse was coming from. One photograph even captured groom Mr Jackson turning his head. 

Mr De Las Salas said that he feared someone would start attacking the wedding party - and could even have a gun, ABC 23 reported.

However Mr De Las Salas said that his family and friends provided 'stellar support' during such a terrible moment.  

His new husband Mr Jackson said he feels that the stranger took the joy from the couple's special day. 

The city of Coronado and the home owner's association of the apartment complex offered the couple their apologies.
