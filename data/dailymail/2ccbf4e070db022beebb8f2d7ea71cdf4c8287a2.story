One newborn has already proved she's a real New Yorker, being so impatient as to force her mom into delivery right on a crosswalk rather than wait for a cab to the hospital in rush hour traffic.

A Fox news crew just happened to be driving by on their way to cover another story around 3:30pm when they saw a large crowd gathered on the corner of 68th and Third Avenue on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

Thinking someone had feinted, reported Linda Schmidt offered to call an ambulance but soon learned that a woman had just given birth.

Quick labor: A woman gave birth to a baby girl on a New York City crosswalk yesterday afternoon

Rush to the hospital: The woman had reportedly already gone into labor around 3:30 when her doorman walked her to the corner to hail a cab. Pictured leaving in an ambulance with her husband carrying a backpack

According to witnesses, the unidentified mother had already gone into labor by the time she left her apartment on East 68th Street.

Her doorman walked her up to Third Avenue to catch a cab, but the baby just couldn't wait.

'She was like, "Oh my god, the baby's coming,"' one female witness said, 'And then I could see the baby's head coming out.'

That witness said it was only a matter of seconds after the baby crowned that the little girl was born.

Just seconds: But once she got to the corner, the baby's head was already crowning and witnesses say it was only a matter of seconds before the woman gave birth

Baby's first blanket: Several women offered the baby their scarves since it was a chilly day in the mid-30s

Doing fine: Mom and daughter were taken to Lenox Hill Hospital where they were recovering fine

Several female bystanders rushed to offer their scarves to wrap the baby, since temperatures were in the chilly mid-30s.

'I happened to be crossing the street and the baby came out...all I could do is cover her up with my scarf,' another witness said. 'Amazing - A miracle on 3rd Avenue.' 

The woman, her husband and their newborn child were taken to Lenox Hill Hospital where both were reportedly recovering fine.

This was the couple's third child together.

Witnesses: The witness on the left said she held the baby's head as it was crowning, while the woman on the right offered up her scarf and called the birth a 'miracle on Third Avenue'
