A man allegedly slapped one of his seven children for playing video games and then stabbed his wife to death after she confronted him about it.

John Leo Davis Jr, 37, from Goodyear in Phoenix, Arizona, has been charged with first degree murder after 35-year-old Michele Davis was killed on Thursday night while the youngsters - aged between three and 14 - were at home.

Police say at least one of the kids - a 14-year-old daughter - witnessed her mother get stabbed 13 times and called 911.

According to authorities, the husband also called 911, reportedly crying and saying he'd lost his mind and stabbed his wife. 

The husband was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder and jailed on $2 million bond. He didn't have a lawyer when he appeared before a judge.

AZ Central reported that the dispute began when one of the youngsters was playing videogames.

Davis got angry and hit them in the face. The child went and told Mrs Davis, prompting her to confront her husband.

A row started and suddenly the children saw Davis start chasing his wife while holding a knife. 

Michele was taken to hospital, but was already dead on arrival. 

According to court documents Davis approached her husband when he slapped one of the youngsters 

He made his first court appearance on Friday and is being held on $2million bond 

The children were immediately taken away from the home and are in the care of their relatives. 

Davis has a history of violence against partners, court records show.

In 2008 he was arrested in California for assault against Michele and child abuse. 

Two years earlier he was arrested twice in the space of 12 months.

A GoFundMe page has been set up to help care for the children.
