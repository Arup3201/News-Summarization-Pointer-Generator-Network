From sitting lifeless to smiling and standing, this is the heartwarming moment an Alzheimer's patient undergoes a startling transformation as her musician son performs for her.

Joe Fraley, 34, from Los Angeles, California, filmed the moment he played his guitar and sang for his 70-year-old mother Judy at her nursing home. 

As he  plays away, video footage shows his sole spectator suddenly getting into the swing of things.

At one point she shakes her hands along to the rhythm and then at the end she stands on two feet to say 'bravo'.

'Isn't he good?' the senior says to other patients at the hospice.

Fraley told Daily Mail Online that his mother is now in the late stages of Alzheimer's and it seems like she could 'go at any time'.

He continued: 'Right now she's lost a lot of her basic motor functions. 

'She doesn't understand how to do things like go to the bathroom, getting dressed, etc and needs assistance. She hasn't eaten in months.'

However, when the singer-songwriter went to pay his mother a visit this week he was shocked to see the restorative effect his music had on her.

He said the song he sung to her was about 'focusing on the things that make you feel good about yourself and make your life worth living.'

It's not the first time Fraley has filmed himself singing to his mother. 

Last fall, he captured a musical session at his parents' house on the veranda before the Alzheimer's had reached its end stage.

Fraley said he wanted the melodies to trigger some king of memory.

The clip went on to garner more than one million hits with many viewers applauding the singer's 'kind' and 'caring' actions.

Touching on the impact his recent vocal jam had on his mother, he concluded: 'Alzheimer's is an odd disease, it's amazing how much things can go up and down.'

In a post on Reddit, Fraley previously noted that he felt guilty about releasing his videos to the public, because they show his beloved mother 'at her worst' and he felt, to a certain extent, as though he was exploiting her illness.

'Part of me felt like it would be exploiting my mom and letting strangers see her at her worst,' he wrote.

'She was a college professor and after she was let go from her job she was very self-conscious of people thinking she was stupid.'

But in the end he said he was glad he posted the videos because 'people have said such nice things and it promotes awareness of such a horrible disease.

'My dad and three siblings are proud as well.'

The Fraley family are currently raising money via the crowdfunding site GoFundMe to pay for Mrs Fraley's medical treatment. 

Any remaining funds  will be donated to the Alzheimer's Association in her name.
