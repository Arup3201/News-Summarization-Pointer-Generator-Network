Anderson Silva is confident he has fully recovered from his horrific broken leg as he prepares to make his comeback in the new year.

The Brazilian snapped his leg in his rematch with UFC middleweight champion Chris Weidman 12 months ago.

The 39-year-old returns against Nick Diaz on January 31 having had a titanium rod inserted in his leg.

‘There is nothing wrong with my leg anymore, I am able to move as normal, kick and jump. I am doing everything as normal, and it doesn’t hurt anymore,’ he said.

Silva’s doctor said he was lucky to avoid having his leg amputated and that he was walking using crutches just weeks after the fight.

‘Five children and 16 nephews, imagine everyone running around in the house,’ Silva said, remembering the time he spent in recovery.

‘They would pick up my crutches and throw them around, you wouldn’t believe it. There were tough times of course, which I don’t like remembering, but the good thing was that I had them there at my side. They helped me a lot.

‘I am well, thank God. I hope to be able to kick well. If I am in any doubt, I will kick more from the waist up.’
