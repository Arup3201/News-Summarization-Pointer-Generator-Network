Dieters who join Weight Watchers lose five times more weight than those who go it alone

Slimmers who embark on a DIY diet lose a lot less weight than those who join a slimming group, according to a new report.

The latest American study reveals that dieters who join Weight Watchers lose, on average, five times more weight than those who go it alone.

Researchers at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, compared weight loss among people following the Weight Watchers approach with those following a self-help approach.

The findings showed that after both three and six months, people who followed the Weight Watchers approach achieved significantly greater weight loss than people who tried to lose weight on their own.

Average weight loss after three months in the Weight Watchers group was 8.6lbs, compared with 1.8lbs in the self-help group.

After six months the difference in results between the groups was even more stark, with average weight loss in the Weight Watchers group 10.1lbs, compared with 1.3lbs in the self-help group.

Dr Craig Johnston, lead researcher on the study said: ‘The difference in weight loss between the two groups is compelling.

‘Whilst people in the Weight Watchers group demonstrated significant weight loss at six months, people in the self-help group started to re-gain weight. 

‘Over time, it is unlikely that DIY diets are successful.

‘Also striking is the level of weight loss in the Weight Watchers group. Simply put, more people in the Weight Watchers group experienced clinically meaningful weight loss which has been shown to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases.’

As part of the study, 147 people were asked to follow the Weight Watchers programme, while another 145 participants were asked to diet alone.

Those in the self-help group were provided with publicly available printed materials explaining basic dietary and exercise guidelines for safe weight loss.

The study concluded that for the Weight Watchers group, the most important factor for weight-loss success was attending the meetings.

Zoe Hellman, Head of Public Health at Weight Watchers said: ‘These results demonstrate that the Weight Watchers approach works.

‘We believe that our meetings provide a powerful element of regular group support, where people are motivated, supported and learn how to change their lifestyles - and we have all the tools available to help them, with online and mobile access to our programme.’

This is the latest published research which supports the body of clinical evidence that proves Weight Watchers to be an effective and sustainable weight loss approach.

A one-year global study recently published in The Lancet indicated that overweight and obese adults referred to Weight Watchers lost more than twice as much weight as those who just received care from their GP practice.

An independent study published in the British Medical Journal also concluded that community based weight loss programmes were more effective and cheaper than those provided by specially trained health professionals.
