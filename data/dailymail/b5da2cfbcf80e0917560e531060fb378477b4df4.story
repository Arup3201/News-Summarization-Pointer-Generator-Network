Foreign doctors, nurses and cleaners who can’t speak English are being sent on courses to learn the language – at the expense of the taxpayer.

Nearly a third of all hospitals in England – 31 out of 110 NHS Trusts - are sending their foreign staff on English language courses, with some spending around £2,000 per time.

A report released earlier this year revealed 11 per cent of NHS or community health services staff were not from the UK - with people employed from more than 200 countries.

West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust sent Bulgarian, Brazilian and Chinese employees - who are working in admin and catering roles - on an English language course at a cost of £2,960, according to The Sun.

Gloucestershire Hospitals Foundation Trust also spent £2,050 sending staff for lessons, while Mid Cheshire spent £2,000 sending 18 Spanish nurses on a course, the newspaper reported.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, told The Sun: ‘It’s time health chiefs look at why people from the UK are not filling those roles.’

It comes ahead of new language checks for European doctors which are set to be brought in this summer.

The General Medical Council (GMC) will be able to force doctors from the European Union to take language tests if there are concerns about their ability to communicate with their patients.

Under existing rules, the GMC can only test the language skills of foreign doctors from outside the EU.

Since 1983 it has been banned from testing the skills of those arriving from member states.

In 2008, German doctor Daniel Urbani accidentally killed Cambridge patient David Gray when he confused two drugs and gave him 10 times the recommended dose of diamorphine.

Under the new rules to be brought in later this year, there will be a new category in which a doctor can be found ‘impaired because he or she does not have the necessary knowledge of English’.

There will also be a new power to force doctors to undergo an English language test if a ‘relevant, serious complaint is made about them’.

The GMC will also have the power to ‘indefinitely suspend doctors who don’t develop sufficient English language skills to treat patients safely’.

Announcing the changes in February, Niall Dickson, Chief Executive of the GMC, said: ‘Doctors who want to practise in the UK must be able to communicate effectively in English to ensure the safety of their patients.

‘These new measures to ensure doctors from other European countries can communicate in English, combined with the higher test score requirements, will help us strengthen protection for patients.

They will also bring about a greater degree of fairness between our requirements for European doctors and for those from outside Europe.'
