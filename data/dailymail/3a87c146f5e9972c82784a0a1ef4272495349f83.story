A children's hospice nurse has been struck off after posting a four-letter rant about work on Facebook

Allison Hopton, 40, posted a string of abusive remarks on the social networking site about the hospice - which provides end of life care for terminally ill children - in the mistaken belief that only her 380 friends could see them. 

Mrs Hopton had complained online about her job telling friends she had 'big b******ing sh***ing bast*** work tomorrow'.

In another message she joked that she was going to make a student nurse her 'b**ch' - and a picture of another colleague sitting on a bedpan.

But a hearing was told her remarks could easily be seen by any patient, their families or a colleague with Facebook accounts if they simply searched for her name.

Mrs Hopton was sacked from her job at the Ty Hafan hospice in Sully near Cardiff after the posts were discovered.

She told her employers: 'Facebook is where people vent. Nurses are human. I don't mix work with my private life.

'I feel I have been professional.'

She admitted to the Nursing and Midwifery Council that the comments had been inappropriate.

The disciplinary panel, in Cardiff, ruled that she should be banned from working as a nurse.

In a statement Mrs Hopton said: 'I cannot go back in time, although I wish I could.

'I have however reflected on the whole incident and changed my behaviour because of it. I accept that comments were irresponsible and stupid, a complete lapse of judgment.'

Mrs Hopton, from near Swansea, South Wales, worked at the hospice from 2007 to 2011 when she was dismissed.

She was originally given a six-month ban but the panel reviewed their decision and chose to strike her off as well.

They ruled that Mrs Hopton, who did not attend the hearing, had not used her taken the opportunity to 'reflect' on her misconduct.

A panel spokesman said: 'Mrs Hopton used a number of profanities on her Facebook page and made direct and indirect references to the hospice. 

Mrs Hopton moaned about her job telling friends she had 'big b******ing sh***ing bast*** work tomorrow'. In another abusive message she said she was going to make a student nurse her 'b**ch' - and a picture of another colleague sitting on a bedpan

'The panel was mindful of the vulnerable nature of those in her care and the sensitivity that would need to be applied to the families of patients at the hospice and the wider public.

'Her comments on Facebook had been wholly inappropriate and had undoubtedly called into question her judgment and integrity.

'The public rightly expect nurses to act in such a way as to uphold public confidence in the profession.

'As a registered nurse, Mrs Hopton had a duty to uphold public confidence in the profession. Her numerous remarks had undoubtedly brought the reputation of the profession into disrepute and undermined public confidence in the profession.'
