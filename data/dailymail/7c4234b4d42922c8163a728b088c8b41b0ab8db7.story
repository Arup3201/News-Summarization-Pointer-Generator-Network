The Australian golfer who was allegedly abducted and robbed in Hawaii before being woken up by a homeless woman has compared his experience with the action film Taken. 

In an interview with the Seven Network on Monday morning, a battered and bruised Robert Allenby said the FBI are investigating the alleged incident. 

But the FBI denies that. 

'The FBI is not investigating this matter whatsoever,' FBI Special Agent Tom Simon told Daily Mail Australia on Monday morning.

'A little bit of an American civics lesson - the FBI could only investigate a kidnapping if the victim was transferred interstate.'

But Mr Simon said he did not believe Allenby was lying about FBI involvement.

'I don't believe the golfer was lying. Here's what the confusion arose from. 

'The head of security for the PGA in Hawaii who I believe spoke to the alleged victim is a retired FBI special agent. 

'So I believe it was from that conversation that the golfer came to the erroneous but not illogical conclusion the FBI was looking into this field.  

Allenby was having dinner at the Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki with his close friend Anthony Puntoriero on Friday night. 

As he left the restaurant, he believes he was drugged, robbed and beaten before being thrown in the boot of a car.

On Sunrise this morning, Allenby said: 'I've watched Taken quite a few times. It kind of felt pretty much the same as that. Just very surreal, yeah.'

The thriller flick features Liam Neeson playing a former spy who is trying to track down his biological daughter, who has been sold into sex slavery. 

Allenby said he paid the bill and when he came out of the bathroom he was told Mr Puntoriero had already gone downstairs. 

'I walked around the corner and then bang,' he said. 'Next minute I was thrown out of the boot of the car. - which they call a trunk over here - just on to the side street.'

Allenby said he had no recollection of his time spent in the boot as he had been knocked unconscious. 

Allenby, who has bruising and cuts to his nose and forehead, said he had no memory of the attack.

'I have no recollection of being in the boot of the car because I was knocked unconscious straight away,' Mr Allenby told the Seven Network.

'I still don't know if I was robbed before or after, but obviously everything I had in my possession was taken. 

The golfer said the police and FBI were currently working on the case, and it wasn't clear if the attack was targeted.

Earnings: Allenby is 27th on the all-time list for the PGA Tour with $27,329,892 

But he said police had found that one of his credit cards was used in Waikiki on Sunday night.

'Whoever did it is definitely still around, still in town,' Allenby said

The four-time PGA Tour winner paid special tribute to a homeless woman who helped him as he was starting to be harassed by other homeless people after being dumped out of the car.

The homeless woman got the bruised and beaten golfer away from the others, before a retired military officer also came to his aid.

'I was very fortunate, a homeless lady pretty much saved my life,' Allenby added.

Scans have cleared Allenby of any serious facial or head injuries and he is hopeful of being cleared to fly in the next day or two.

He doesn't yet know when he'll next hit the golf course.

'The chances of me playing next week are very slim, but I'm just taking it one day at a time.' 

'Medically, I thankfully didn't suffer anything major beyond some bumps and bruises that will take a bit of time to heal,' Allenby said in a statement released by the PGA Tour on Sunday.

'My plan currently is to fly back to the mainland and at that point, evaluate my ability to play next week at the Humana Challenge.

'Whatever the outcome regarding my ability to play next week, I anticipate a successful rest of the 2014-15 PGA Tour season.'

Allenby has noticeable damage and lacerations to his nose and forehead. He has told reporters the FBI and local police have some leads.  

'We have some names and numbers and they have some leads to follow up, so I am confident they will get the guys,' Allenby said.

'With the FBI guys involved, they're the best, the guys on the tour are awesome, and they'll get to the bottom of it.' 

The 43-year-old had been drinking with caddy Mick Middlemo and friend Anthony Punteriero

Allenby was most concerned about potentially not being able to call 13-year-old daughter Lily for her birthday, but scans have cleared him of any serious facial or head injuries and he is hopeful of being cleared to fly in the next day or two.

'She's really upset about it but at the end of the day it could have been a lot worse,' the Victorian said.

'I don't care about the money or my cards or anything like that. I am just glad I have survived this one.' 

After the incident, the Australian golfer was then returned to the Kahala Hotel where he had spent the week while playing at the Sony Open held at the nearby Waialae Country Club - where Allenby failed to make the cut after the first two days of play.

His friend Anthony Puntoriero - who was with Allenby earlier on the night - confirmed he was kidnapped. 

'He's all right now but we are still talking to detectives,' Puntoriero told AAP.

Puntoriero and Allenby's caddy were not with the four-time PGA Tour winner at the moment of the abduction. 

Allenby was set to head back to the US on Saturday morning, but has stayed on to assist police with their investigations.

He reportedly managed to piece together some of the night after being reunited with Puntoriero and his caddy, and CCTV footage from the wine bar is being reviewed in an attempt to identify the perpetrators.

The 43-year-old has been a professional golfer since 1992, and while a consistent performer on the PGA Tour for 15 years he has never won a major tournament.

Allenby's best result at a major was to finish equal seventh - which he achieved twice - at the 2004 U.S. Open and the 2008 Open Championship.

He won Australia's 'triple crown' in 2005 - winning the Masters, Australian PGA and Australian Open.

He's also been a regular in the Presidents Cup, representing the International team five times between 1993 and 2009. 

The Melbourne-born golfer now lives in the U.S. full time, in Jupiter, Florida.
