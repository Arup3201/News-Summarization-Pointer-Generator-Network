Horrific photographs have emerged of a surfer who was left with staples in his head after he was speared by an out-of-control board when he tried to catch a wave.

The photograph, which shows a bloody head with deep scars,  has raised concerns and the dangers that could put lives at risk among the surfing community.

The man, who refused to provide his name, went for a swim at one of Sydney's Northern Beaches when he was speared in the head by a 'runaway long-board' on Thursday morning.

Australian surf website Swellnet editor Stuart Nettle, who reported the incident, told Daily Mail Australia it was only a matter of time before a disaster strikes.

'These incidents come around a couple of times a year and it's met with the same reaction,' Mr Nettle said.

'It's the same reaction time and time again and it's a disbelief that people continue to not wear leg-ropes - it's not getting any closer to a solution to convince everyone to wear one.'

When the same encounter happened to him, Mr Nettle said he was outraged and soon felt motivated to pledge for a law in a bid to ban surfers who avoid using the leg-rope from the water.

'I have met with a feller from Slater and Gordon Lawyers but he told me it was an extreme case that's impossible to sue because there's no legislation for it,' he said.

'Unless it's shown and proven in court that the incident was done deliberately but either that - it's not possible.

'It's a simple issue that could be fixed - I understand that surfers just want to retain that freedom where they don't wear leg-ropes but it would be good if a majority of them start acting responsibly.

'Just remember that you're not alone out there in the surf and it's easy to lose your board - and that could seriously hurt someone.' 

The incident comes after Craig Warren was smashed in the head with a wooden board last year (pictured)

The incident comes three months after a Gold Coast surfer was smashed in the head with a wooden's 1960's-style Malibu surfboard when a swimmer refused to wear a leg rope in the water.

Craig Warren was swimming with his children and some friends at Snappers Rocks in October last year when he noticed a long board flying at him 'like a missile'.

'I noticed the board coming at me like a missile when the guy fell off with no leg rope,' the 41-year-old told Daily Mail Australia.

'I tried to dodge it and I could have potentially got out of the way if I dived down but the water was too shallow.

'Those old school boards are very heavy and big and they could seriously cause death.

'I'm not being a grumpy old man but a classic example is – if my head was one of my kids or someone else's son or daughter, the outcome would be a lot different.

'The one that hit me had a reasonable size fin on it and it took a chunk out of my head.'

The father of two was dragged back to shore by his nine-year-old son Taj and was bandaged on the spot by his friend before getting 23 stitches at the hospital.
