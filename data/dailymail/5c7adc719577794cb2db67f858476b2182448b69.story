Presenter John Humphrys last night said the BBC is too big and staff numbers could be cut by a third

John Humphrys last night claimed the BBC is too big, obsessed by box-ticking and could be cut by a third.

He warned the corporation could lose its right to charge the licence fee when its funding next comes under review and he said that ‘would be the end of the BBC as we know it.’

The veteran interviewer - who has presented the Today programme for 26 years - said he was devoted to the BBC but felt its original values had become distorted over time. He added: ‘There are times when you worry about that.

‘The values of (first BBC director general) Lord Reith, were to "inform, educate and entertain". I do worry we get those a little muddled at times. Entertainment gets pushed up too far.’

Mr Humphrys, 70, made his comments during a wide-ranging interview about his career at a public meeting of the Media Society in London.

Reflecting on his BBC career, he said he was often infuriated by the layers of bureaucracy that require journalists and editors to adhere to strict guidelines rather than exercise their own judgment.

He said: ‘We didn’t have the word "compliance" in the past. I’m deeply uneasy about it.

‘As far as I’m concerned if you’re the editor of the Today programme, you make decisions based on your knowledge and judgment rather than go through a book and say "am I fully compliant?"

‘There is an amazing amount of box ticking and it worries me.

‘I won’t say there haven’t been times when I’ve used fairly robust language on the editorial floor and made my views clear to my superiors.’ 

Asked whether the BBC should be slimmed down, Mr Humphrys said: ‘It’s too big. We could take out a third of it I think.’

He added: ‘The most important people are the journalists. We could cut out layers of management and still produce the news.’

Mr Humphrys also criticised the BBC for failing to put enough women on air, particularly after they reach middle age.

Last year, Mishal Husain joined the Today team, bringing the number of female presenters on the programme to two, compared with three men.

Mr Humphrys said: ‘We’re getting there. But it has been outrageous, in particular it doesn’t have enough older women.

‘I’m still slogging away at the age of 103.

‘I look at breakfast TV and I see a sea of young shining faces. Where are the older women?

‘Look at all the newsreaders. Anna Ford started as a beautiful young presenter.

‘She is still beautiful but she isn’t as young. There are aren’t any older women reading the news.’ 

Mr Humphrys’ comments are just the latest in a string of stinging attacks by current and former BBC staff.

In November, presenter David Dimbleby called on director general Tony Hall to slim down the corporation and hand parts of the licence fee to its commercial rivals.

And in a separate attack, former TV news head Roger Mosey said the BBC was too big and too left wing.

Mr Humphrys also criticised the high levels of pay earned by BBC stars, singling out Jonathan Ross

The comments prompted the director of television Danny Cohen to call for his staff to stop criticising the BBC and get on with their jobs.

He said: ‘I’m finding a little too often that people who work for the BBC and are well rewarded for it are quick to attack or criticise the organisation in public rather than deal with any issues or concerns internally.’

Mr Humphrys also criticised the high levels of pay earned by BBC stars, singling out Jonathan Ross, who earned £18million while he was at the corporation.

Asked if the BBC should be more careful with licence fee payers’ money, he said: ‘There’s no doubt about it. I say that in the knowledge I earn a lot of money myself.‘The amount paid to Jonathan Ross wasn’t just outrageous, it was silly.

‘I remember I had lunch with the former director general (Mark Thompson) shortly after I first commented on that and he just didn’t see it.’

Asked whether he thought the BBC’s funding could be cut when its charter is reviewed in 2017, Mr Humphrys said: ‘I think the licence fee will continue. I think questions will be asked again, as they should be, about the strategic direction of the BBC.

‘I profoundly hope it does (continue) because if it doesn’t that’s the end of the BBC as we know it.

‘Will it be in line with inflation, will it be a generous settlement? I suspect probably not.’
