A man waiting for a New York City subway lost his cell phone on the tracks Monday afternoon and then lost his life trying to get it back.

The straphanger was reportedly waiting for a train at Manhattan's Christopher Street stop when he dropped his phone and jumped down onto the tracks to retrieve it.

When the man made contact with the electrified 'third rail' he was killed.

Killed: A man at the Greenwich Village subway stop in Manhattan died Monday when he was electrocuted by the 'third rail' while trying to retrieve a cell phone

This, according to a DNAinfo.com report that puts the time of the Greenwich Village incident, and thus the man's death, at around 3:30pm on July 15.

'Apparently a customer went onto the roadbed and came into contact with the third rail,' a spokesperson for the MTA and the FDNY said.

Reached for comment, an NYPD spokesperson declined to say if the unnamed victim had been identified by authorities Monday evening.

Traffic: The tragic incident occurred just before rush hour and caused a commuter headache into the late afternoon

Dangerous: Subway deaths are on the rise in 2013. MTA officials have ramped up education efforts aimed at warning riders never to jump to the track to retrieve dropped items, as Monday's victim reportedly did

The incident occurred at rush hour and caused several reroutings and delays for Manhattan commuters into late afternoon.

Though relatively rare, electrocutions do occur in New York City's vast system of rail tunnels.

And 2013 is shaping up to be a memorable year for subway deaths.

This past February, nine subway injuries occurred over the course of just six days, three of which were fatal.

Most subway deaths are ruled suicides and occur as a result of a victim being hit by an oncoming train. Few of the deaths are caused by electrocution.

Calamity: Just this month, Brooklyn man Matthew Zeno, 30, (pictured) was fatally electrocuted as he urinated on a third rail

But just this month, a Brooklyn man was fatally electrocuted when he urinated on the third rail after a night out to a few bars.

Matthew Zeno, 30, decided to walk along the tracks in the early morning hours of July 8. When he relieved himself on the electrified rail, he was killed. A friend who came to Zeno's aid was also electrocuted but was merely injured.

The 'third rail,' aka contact rail, operates on 625 volts, easily enough to kill a grown man.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has ramped up education efforts in 2013 aimed at cutting down on subway deaths. Audio announcements and signs throughout the system warn riders never to try retrieving items dropped on the tracks.

Powerful: Though subway deaths are rare, they are on the rise in 2013. Most do not occur from electrocution, but the MTA warns riders of the dangers of jumping to the tracks near the deadly 625-volt third rail
