An entire train had to be evacuated in Switzerland  after a snake made its way on board during Wednesday rush hour.

All 450 passengers on the early morning train from Bern to Basel in Switzerland had to leave the train after a 19.5in snake was spotted in one of the carriages.

A passenger saw the non-venomous black garter snake on the train and alerted staff who immediately called police.

Hundreds of people had to evacuate the train while police searched for the reptile, a spokeswoman said.

â€˜All 450 passengers on the train were evacuated,â€™  Donatella Del Vecchio, spokeswoman for the SBB national rail company said.

The passengers were transferred to another train that left around half an hour later.

A
 passenger had most likely brought the snake on board, Del Vecchio said,
 ruling out the possibility it made its way onto the train on its own.

Police finally caught the snake in a ventilation shaft, Bern police said in a statement.

It is not the first time the fear in film Snakes On A Plane has become reality on the Swiss tracks.

In 2006, a 3ft-long snake escaped from its owner on a train in west Switzerland.

The snake slithered into the inner roof of the carriage and the train was taken out of service.

The snake was, reportedly, never found, despite attempts to lure it back out with mice and rats.
