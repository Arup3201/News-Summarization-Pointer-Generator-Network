A wife gave her husband the gift of life for Valentine's Day by donating one of her kidneys.

Sun Guofang, 28, beat odds of 100,000-to-one to be a match for Li Fangdong, 33, after he suffered kidney failure shortly after they were married.

The couple, who dated for two years before getting wed in 2009, booked in for the life-changing operation on February 14.

They were checked into the hospital in China's Shandong province where the surgery was successfully carried out this week, People's Daily Online reports. 

Li and his dad had both initially been against Sun getting tested as they thought she was too young to give up a kidney.

So Sun got tested in secret before convincing them to let her do it for the sake of the couple's four-year-old son. 

She said: 'I actually got the results back saying that we were a match on Valentine's Day, which meant it was the perfect moment to make the offer to my husband and I was glad when he finally accepted. 

'I am told I can get by fine with one kidney anyway and I have a healthy diet so I don't expect it to be any real problem.'

In need: Li Fangdong is taken into surgery to receive one of his wife's kidneys they hope will end years of pain

The couple from Liangwang village, near the eastern city of Jinan, are expected to remain in hospital for another five days before they are allowed home. 

Sun had worked as a sales manager in a local toy company until her mother-in-law was diagnosed with kidney failure in 2009.

She was forced to leave her job so she could be closer to where her husband's mother was being treated. Li's mother died two years later.

'I quit my job after my mother-in-law got sick. I sold egg pancakes on the street in the day then went back to work in the shop,' said Sun.

Initially, Sun was embarrassed to sell food on the streets so would cover her face with a dust mask.

But then her husband became ill and needed dialysis three times a week which cost £64 a session.

Recovering: Sun Guofang gives the thumbs up sign after successful surgery to remove her kidney

She said: 'At the time, we owed other people 200,000-300,000 yuan (£32,000). 

'I never thought it was a difficult situation, as long as my husband and I strive together, everything will get better.' 

Now the pair are recovering in hospital and Sun says she is ready for life to start going back to normal.

She said: 'I have a bit of a fever but other than that I feel fine, and am looking forward to going home.'

Li, who also has a heart problem and lung infection, said that the couple had already started making plans for their new life together. 

'It meant a lot to me when she said she was going to spend her life with me,' he said.

'Once the stitches been removed we plan to do a bit of travelling together to catch up on lost time.'
