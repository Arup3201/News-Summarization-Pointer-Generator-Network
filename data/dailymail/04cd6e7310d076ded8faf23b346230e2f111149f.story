Staying put? Dr Jim Sears, 48, has denied claims he is leaving popular CBS chat show 'The Doctors' 

Dr Jim Sears, star of daytime talk show 'The Doctors', has denied reports that he is about to leave the cast while being investigated for threatening his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend.  

TMZ reported that Sears, 48, was at his Huntington Beach, California home last month with his girlfriend when she felt 'uneasy' and asked her ex to pick her up. The ex-boyfriend, Pete Scalisi, arrived at the home and took the woman away.

But Sears 'flew into a rage', called Scalisi and accused of him kidnapping the woman - before driving to his house, TMZ reported.

'I'm going to kill you!' he allegedly shouted at Scalisi.

Scalisi then filed a police report against the doctor, alleging that he had made criminal threats.

Police are investigating but have yet to speak with Sears, the website noted, adding that the doctor is leaving the show 'very soon'.

But Sears' lawyers this morning vehemently denied the claims to DailyMail.com, calling the allegations 'a complete fabrication'.

'Dr. Spears did not threaten anyone's life and is not resigning from The Doctors,' Michael P. Wippler said in an email.

The Doctors, a CBS daytime talk show that started in 2008, features a panel of doctors, including Sears, discussing a range of various health-related topics with audience members.

Sears, a pediatrician, works at a family practice in Capistrano Beach, California with his father and younger brother. He has two children with his former wife, Diane, and a third child.

In 2011, he revealed on the show that he had proposed to his girlfriend, Gina, during a vacation to Hawaii. It is not clear if she was the woman cited in the police report.

He is a published author, serves as the Children's Health Specialist for the AOL Medical Advisory Board and has featured as an expert for a range of outlets, including Parenting.com and CNN.

Following an appearance on CNN last year, Dr Sears was forced to apologize for comments he made about six-year-old Coy Mathis, a transgender child who wished to use the girl's school bathroom, GLAAD reported.

Sears said he would not be happy with a child with a penis sharing the bathroom with his daughter, saying it would be 'uncomfortable' for the girls in the bathroom.

He later released a statement saying he had made comments based on the assumption that the youngster would have acted 'like a typical boy'.

'I understand Coy as transgender is not likely to display those same tendencies,' he said. 'I do apologize for implying she may display the same behavior as I have seen with young boys her age.'
