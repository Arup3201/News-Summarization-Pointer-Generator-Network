The houses are neat, the streets and pavements are kept clean and even the flowers in the gardens are a picture of regimented orderliness.

And it appears residents on the upmarket estate close to a river intend to keep it that way.

For around a dozen signs have been installed on lamp posts warning dog walkers they could be fined £1,000 if they stray on to the estate of executive homes.

Fake: The bogus signs appeared around the Riverside Park estate overnight

But all is not as it seems – for while the signs may bear the Liverpool City Council mark, it appears they are anything but official.

One resident of the Riverside Park 
estate in the suburb of Aigburth said: ‘They went up overnight a while 
back and we all thought they were city council signs because we are on 
the edge of Otterspool Park and there has been a lot of dog walkers who 
don’t dispose of their dog muck.

 'There have been a number of schemes aimed at trying to eradicate it. We thought we were in the same catchment.’

Another said: ‘If they deter people from walking their dogs this way to get to the park then I’m all for it. The pavements are much cleaner these days.

‘Obviously one public-spirited house owner had enough and put up the signs to dissuade dog owners from coming this way.’

The signs read: ‘Liverpool City Council. No dogs in this area (except assistance dogs). Maximum fine £1,000.’ There is also a bogus 10mph speed limit sign.

Yesterday Liverpool City Council expressed surprise at the sudden appearance of the signs.

They say there is no record of them being put up by their contractors, and they believe they are the work of a disgruntled resident who may have got hold of an official sign and made copies.

A council spokesman said: ‘If we determine they are there without proper authority we will ask for the signs to be removed.’
