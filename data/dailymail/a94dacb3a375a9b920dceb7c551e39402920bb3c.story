Stylish Samantha Cameron is known for her knack of dressing impeccably, whatever the occasion, and today the Prime Minister's wife chose a dramatic autumnal sari to take in London's colourful Diwali celebrations.

Samantha, 42, chose a russet-coloured sari edged in gold for a visit to the Swaminarayan Mandir, the largest traditional Hindu temple outside India, at Neasden in north-west London.

She even combined the outfit proudly with a poppy.

Diwali, known as the festival of lights, is a five day celebration undertaken by millions of Hindus, Jains and Sikhs around the world.

For Hindus, the five-year festival of Diwali is one of the most important events in the year. Fireworks and lamps are used to create a riot of colour to celebrate the victory of good over evil, sweets are traded and new clothes bought. Lamps are lit and kept on during the night and families come together to carry out traditional tasks such as cleaning the house to honour the goddess Lakshmi.

While Samantha Cameron looked the part in her dramatic sari, David Cameron chose not to dress quite so spectacularly as his wife though, wearing his trusty navy suit and sensible blue tie.

Mr Cameron was garlanded when he arrived at the Neasden Temple, as it is popularly known, and both he and Samantha were welcomed with a chandlo on their foreheads – the red mark adopted by Hindu worshippers and afforded to guests.

As a customary mark of respect, they removed their shoes before entering (David’s were black slip-ons; Samantha’s nude pumps).

Each was also given a ‘nada chhadi’ cotton-thread wristband, symbolising a bond of friendship.

Yesterday Mrs Cameron displayed hers on her right wrist as she effortlessly blended in with a line-up of sari-clad volunteers.

Meanwhile Mr Cameron, also sporting a poppy and wearing his wristband beneath his sleeve, praised Hindu family and community values.

He urged the UK’s million Hindus to be ‘ever more involved’ in shaping British life. He also announced he would return to India soon.

The Neasden Temple, which opened in 1995, is the largest of its kind outside of India.

Made of almost
 2,820 tons of Bulgarian limestone and 2,000 tons of Italian carrara 
marble the temple was carved in India and then shipped to London for 
building. Since opening the temple has attracted almost three million visitors.

Prime Ministers and their spouses have often paid visits to Hindu 
temples and other religious buildings during the festival of Diwali.

 House of Commons and six years ago Cherie Blair made a speech at the 
United Nations in New York during Diwali highlighting the plight of 
widows.

Gordon Brown, the son of a Church of Scotland minister, also used to attend Diwali celebrations when Prime Minister and would receive the traditional sash made from flowers. American President Barack Obama also attends Diwali celebrations, most notably when he and his wife Michelle made a four-day visit to India in 2010 amid tight security.

On his visit to England in 1970, Yogiji Maharaj consecrated a small 
Swaminarayan Mandir in Islington, London. During his stay in London, on 
26 May 1970, Yogiji Maharaj expressed his dream that a traditional 
mandir be constructed in the future. To realise the dream of his guru, 
Pramukh Swami Maharaj inspired the mandir and consecrated it in 1995.From
 the moment the first stone was cut on 16 February 1993 to the moment 
the final piece was packed in June 1995, over 1,500 skilled village 
craftsmen, artisans from Rajasthan and Gujarat – skilled in traditional 
stone and masonry – worked round the clock chipping away to fashion the 
rough stone and fine marble into the required forms. The finished 
products of rich carvings were a testimony to their exquisite skills of 
craftsmanship.

Stone experts recommended limestone from Bulgaria 
for the mandir exterior and marble from Italy and Ambaji (India) for the
 mandir interior. The stone and marble chosen met necessary aesthetic 
criteria, durable enough to withstand British weather conditions yet 
soft and suitable enough for the delicate work of carving. The Bulgarian
 limestone resisted remarkably well the effects of the extreme weather 
conditions with temperature variations from 30ºC in the summer and 
dropping to minus 15ºC in the winter. The limestone is very dense, with 
fine grains and creamy-white in colour. Italian marble is favored for 
its consistent white coloration, smooth texture and strength. Marble 
from Ambaji is noted for its snow-white appearance and good finishing.Limestone
 and marble were transported in consignments by sea to the port of 
Kandla in Kutch, on the west coast of Gujarat. After the limestone and 
marble blocks were unloaded, they would be transported by truck to the 
main workshop in Kandla, some 8km away. It was decided that much of the 
carving be carried out at Kandla itself for reasons of convenience. A 15
 sq km plot was acquired and cleared up and a mini-township built for 
the craftsmen who would sculpt the stone. Five worksheds were in 
operation at the Kandla site – one for cutting stones, one for marble 
work, one for limestone work, one for polishing and one for packing 
carved materials. It formed what was one of the biggest stone sculpting 
sites in the world. Over 1,500 skilled village craftsmen from Rajasthan 
and Gujarat, skilled in stone and masonry work based on centuries of 
tradition, were involved in the mandir work at 14 different sites in 
India.
