Liverpool's 3-2 victory over Tottenham came as a huge boost in their push for a top-four finish, but for one set of supporters the night was particularly special.

Martin Skrtel's son, Matteo, and girlfriend, Barbora Lovasova, spent time on the Anfield pitch before the game, taking photos and soaking up the atmosphere. 

The defender's son was introduced to club legend Steven Gerrard and also spent time honing his skills in a kick-about with his dad.

Brendan Rodgers' side eventually emerged victorious after an frantic match against Spurs.

Goals from Lazar Markovic, Steven Gerrard, Harry Kane and Mousa Dembele meant the game appeared to be heading for a draw. 

But in the 83rd minute substitute Mario Balotelli finally scored his first Premier League goal for the club to seal all three points.

Skrtel himself enjoyed a quiet game, and was booked in the 40th minute, but the Slovak will be unperturbed after his side moved within three points of the Champions League places.
