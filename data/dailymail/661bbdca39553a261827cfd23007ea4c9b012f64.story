The T-Rex skeleton has been modelled on a dinosaur called Stan, which was first unearthed in 1992

Each of Stan's 190 bones were discovered apart, but had suffered little-to-no distortion or crushing over the millions of years since his death. The bones were used as a model for the silicone pieces (pictured)
