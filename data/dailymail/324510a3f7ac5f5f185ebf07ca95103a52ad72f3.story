Jamie Winter admitted lying to her clients about the extent of her Botox training

Beautician Jamie Winter mislead customers for 18 months claiming the entire time she had completed Harley Street training in administering Botox - but the truth was she never finished the course.

Winter now says she needs a
 shot of Botox herself to counteract the aging effects of the court case after 
admitting lying to clients and injecting them with the skin plumper.

One unsuspecting client was left with swollen eyes when she suffered a bad reaction to the treatment given by Winter, from Leeds.

The now unemployed 35-year-old admitted misleading customers over the extent of her Harley Street training when she injected clients with the anti-ageing drug in a bid to help them look more youthful.

Hull Crown Court heard around a dozen people from Scarborough and Bridlington had been treated by Winter, who told reporters outside the court: ' I shall be going home now to do some Botox because this whole case has been totally ageing'.

Winter, who practised for 18 months and lived in Scarborough at the time, told clients she had undergone specialist training at the Academy in Harley Street, London at a cost of £6,500.

However she never completed the £10,000 course. At the time no qualifications were needed to administer Botox.

The case came to light after one client reacted badly to the drug and suffered swelling around the eyes. She approached a solicitor seeking compensation and was advised to go to the police.

Having launched an investigation Humberside Police interviewed 12 people - two men and 10 women - who had run up bills for treatment ranging from £180 to £360 for a course of injections.

The drug was unlicensed and available on the internet for £70.

Winter was arrested in May 2012 and charged with fraud by false representation, claiming she had trained for two years and was qualified to inject the drug.

Appearing in court the brunette, wearing a blonde wig in an effort to disguise her face, pleaded guilty to five charges of fraud by false representation between July 2011 and August 2012.

Botox is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to temporarily improve the look of wrinkles.

The drug is also used to treat overactive bladder symptoms, prevent chronic headaches, treat increased muscle stiffness, specific eye problems, underarm sweating and other medical conditions.

Manufacturers of the drug warn it can cause life-threatening side effects.

All practitioners must now be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC).

To find a qualified practitioner visit the Department of Health backed Treatments You Can Trust Register.

The cost of treatment varies with some clinics charging £100 while others price the procedure at £350. Most clinics charge on a 'per area' or 'per unit' basis.

Prosecuting barrister Jharna Jobes said 
Winter was initially facing fraud charges against 12 clients but said 
the Crown was prepared to accept her not guilty pleas to seven and to a 
charge of concealing criminal property - £10,500 in a gym locker - as it
 would make no difference to her sentence.

Defending his client, barrister Richard Thompson, said Winter initially protested her innocence and wanted a trial, which was not in the public interest.

He said: 'At the time of the allegations there was no system of regulation. What was being alleged is fraud.

'She says at the time her clients were perfectly happy for her to administer Botox.

'It was initially charged as assault but these were people who were willing to have this done to them.

'The assault charge has been dropped.'

Speaking outside court Ms Winter, now of Leeds, said: 'I do accept I mislead some people and should have made it clear what my training was. But I never injured anyone.

'The case was originally motivated by compensation. The police jumped in and got it all wrong.

'They thought people needed to be qualified to administer Botox.

'The reality is they don’t. I did not complete the college course because it would have cost me £10,000 and I would not have been qualified.

'The whole case has been blown out of proportion.'

Leaving court she said she has administered the drug on herself but was not seeking a future career in it.

She quipped: 'I shall be going home now to do some Botox,
 because this whole case has been totally aging!'

Judge Michael Mettyear told Winter she should be sentenced at Hull Crown Court on November 11.
