Towards the end of his press conference at Arena Corinthians on Tuesday, Louis van Gaal was asked by a presenter from children’s television whether he thought youngsters in Holland should be allowed to stay up for the game against Argentina.

Van Gaal can be an obtuse man but on this he was unequivocal.

‘I would always allow my children to watch the match because this is absolutely unique,’ said the  Holland coach. Look at the impact of the World Cup at a global level — and this is a semi-final.

‘Most children are on holiday and they won’t sleep anyway because they will be so stressed and tense. I would strongly advise parents to let them watch the match.’

In Holland, they are just glad to have these decisions to make. This was supposed to be a World Cup of limited horizons for Van Gaal and his functional (his own word) team.

Yet, here we are and the Dutch are still in town, preparing for a classic fixture to conjure memories of the 1978 final — won by Argentina in their own country — and a 1998 quarter-final — won by Holland in Marseille.

Those games, of course, featured defining contributions by genuine superstars.

Mario Kempes scored the opening goal in Buenos Aires and Dennis Bergkamp settled the meeting in France with perhaps the best goal of his stellar career in the final minute. On Wednesday night in mild, damp Sao Paulo, we have the opportunity to witness greatness once again.

The deposed World Footballer of the Year, Lionel Messi, has approached this tournament in Brazil as if intent on proving people were wrong to give this year’s title to Cristiano Ronaldo.

So far, he has done a pretty reasonable job and without him Argentina would certainly no longer be here.

Even Messi, though, would struggle to shift Holland’s Arjen Robben as player of the tournament in most people’s minds.

The Bayern Munich forward has taken his game to new levels in South America and it is perhaps not surprising that Argentina appear to be approaching this game with some rather rudimentary ideas about how to stop him.

‘We have to be aggressive, to show the passion of the Argentine players to the Dutch — and especially to Robben,’ said Manchester City defender Martin Demichelis.

‘He doesn’t like physical contact, so you have to make him feel it and get under his skin. He is a  phenomenon but he’s not got much edge, he’s not a fighter. Therefore you have to attack him.’

Demichelis and Robben played together at Bayern in 2009-10. Maybe the South American hasn’t been watching his old club mate closely out here, though, as the Robben of summer 2014 has shown as much courage as any forward in this tournament.

Last Saturday, four of Costa Rica’s back five were booked for crude, hacking fouls on Robben. Still, he strode forward.

No nonsense: Martin Demichelis says Holland are in for some tough treatment

If Argentina are to stop him on Wednesday night in Sao Paulo, they will need to find a cuter way. ‘It’s ridiculous how much he is fouled,’ said Dutch midfielder Nigel de Jong. ‘They foul him because they can’t find another way. He is too good for most.’

It may seem rich to hear members of Holland’s derided 2010 World Cup final team moan about treatment afforded one of their own, given the way De Jong and others kicked the Spain midfield all over Johannesburg four years ago.

Certainly, they will seek other ways to neutralise Messi. Van Gaal’s Holland are different in their approach from the team shaped by Bert van Marwijk and on Tuesday the current manager did his best to play down questions about Barcelona’s magician.

‘We are playing against Argentina and we always refer to teams and not individual players,’ said Van Gaal.

‘We have a plan ready for Argentina. We showed the players Argentina this morning. Messi was once elected best footballer in the world. There’s a  reason for that. If you score so many goals, you have an added value.

‘At the most important stage he can always pull it off but in principle he’s always found it difficult to show that at an international level. He wants to do that at this tournament and we want to stop him doing that, so that’s going to be quite a challenge.’

Dutch training contained some surprises on Tuesday as De Jong, struggling with a groin injury, joined in the session and captain Robin van Persie, who had a stomach bug, did not.

We can expect the latter to start, however, and he is already looking ahead beyond the match.

‘Playing against Argentina is not a dream,’ said Van Persie. ‘It doesn’t interest me at all. We just have to win. A dream is to grab hold of that cup.

‘The other semi-final is Brazil- Germany so we’ll see who we’ll play next weekend.’

Dutch confidence is clearly high. Parents in Amsterdam and beyond should perhaps start planning ahead.
