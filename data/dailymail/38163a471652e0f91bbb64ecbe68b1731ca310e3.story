The subject of the email says it all: 'After Rolf Harris – the last great Australian artist left'.

This was the tasteless reference made by a publicist for Sydney-based AC Agency in a media release sent out on Wednesday promoting an auction of works by iconic Australian artist Pro Hart.

What's more, publicist Dora Nikols made another blunder when she misspelt the convicted paedophile's name - 'Rolph Harris'.

'Since the scandal of Rolph Harris there is only one other great Australian household name left – Pro Hart – and he’s having the last ever sale of his private art collection!' Ms  Nikols wrote in the email that was published in full on mUmbrella.

This was soon followed by another email containing a hasty apology and admitting that the release was 'in poor taste'.

'I would like to deeply apologise for using a story angle that I now realise was in poor taste and deeply regret offending anyone,' she wrote.

John Hart, that famous artist's eldest son, said although he believes the reference was inappropriate he hopes 'people are mature enough to see the difference between the two great Australians'.

Pro Hart, considered to be the father of the Australian landscape painting movement, is famous for his paintings that capture the spirit of the Australian outback

The artist's son, John, says the reference to Rolf Harris was 'inappropriate'

'Personally I don't see the connection but I don't think this was thought out very well,' he told Daily Mail Australia .

About 173 of Pro Hart's art pieces will go under the hammer for the private art collection sale on July 22.

Hart, considered to be the father of the Australian landscape painting movement, is famous for his paintings that capture the spirit of the Australian outback.

The 77-year-old died in 2006 at his Broken Hill home, far west of NSW, after battling motor neurone disease.

Harris, 84, is an Australian entertainer who's been convicted of twelve charges of indecent assault and was sentenced to a maximum of five years and nine months in prison.
