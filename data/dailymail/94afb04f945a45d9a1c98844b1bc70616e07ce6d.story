Vincent Tan has softened in his stance over the future of League Managers’ Association chief executive Richard Bevan.

The Cardiff City owner insists he no longer wants him to resign over his mishandling of the Malky Mackay ‘textgate’ scandal.

The Malaysian billionaire (below) was furious with Bevan after the LMA dismissed an exchange of racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic and sexist emails and text messages between Mackay and Iain Moody as ‘banter’ when the two were colleagues at Cardiff.

On the day Sportsmail’s revelations led to the resignation of Moody as director of football at Crystal Palace and persuaded Palace to pull the plug on plans to appoint Mackay as their new manager, Cardiff responded by calling for Bevan’s resignation.

By then the LMA had issued a public apology for their ‘inappropriate’ original statement.

But at the time it did little to placate an understandably angry Tan.

Asked about his call for Bevan to stand down during an interview with Sky Sports, when he also suggested he might yet sell Cardiff to buy ‘another club in the UK’, Tan said: ‘I would say that maybe we sound a bit harsh, but when you are angry sometimes you can say harsh words. So if you ask me “do I want him to resign?”, maybe not really we want him to resign.’

Tan did urge Bevan not to trivialise such issues in the future, however.

‘Now I would say “Mr Bevan, I don’t really want you to resign but you should take this more seriously”.’

Tan also insisted he had ‘no personal vendetta’ against Mackay, who was sacked as manager of Cardiff in December last year amid concerns over eight transfers. The texts and emails were discovered as part of a Tan-funded investigation into those transfers and, in particular, a raid on the house of former Cardiff head of recruitment Moody.

Tan claims that should Russell Slade become the next Cardiff manager, it will be the first appointment that he has been responsible for

But Tan said it was ‘nothing personal’ with Mackay. ‘There is no personal vendetta,’ he said. ‘This is business. I hardly know him. I didn’t recruit him.’

Tan said he was not responsible for the appointment of Dave Jones or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, either, claiming that Russell Slade will be his first appointment once an issue has been resolved with Slade’s previous club, Leyton Orient.

‘I say now, this next manager, I must like him,’ said Tan before stressing how important it was that he can ‘trust’ his manager. He did admit he might ‘make suggestions’ on team selection even if he insisted Slade would pick the team.
