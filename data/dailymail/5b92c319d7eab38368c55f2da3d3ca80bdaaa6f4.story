This is the moment a pod of killer whales lured dolphins into a bay and savagely attacked them as tourists looked on in horror.

Ferry passengers were taking photos and videos of the elegant creatures skirting at pace over the waves in Canada's Nanaimo Departure Bay.

Little did they know, this was the start of a rare and deadly fight for survival.

Attack: Tourists thought they were watching dolphins at play before the whales launched into a dramatic attack

Dozens of dolphins raced to safety with eight or nine orcas on their tail.

The reality of the scene became clear as the Biggs whales - known for feeding on other mammals - isolated a group and surrounded them.

For a moment, there was silence.

Then blood-soaked water was splashed into the air metres away from families on the boat and on land, helpless to intervene.

The whales leaped and dived, thrashed and biting.

Finally, after minutes of relentless attacking, the whales ate two of the dolphins before darting off, leaving the others to flounder.

Launch: Suddenly their attack commences like a performance, as the whales hurl themselves up and down

'It was crazy because by the time we drove down and parked, the whales 
were actually hunting -- fast, in and out,' one witness told CTV 
Vancouver.

Biggs killer whales are renowned for moving silently, except for when attacking their prey.

They are notoriously dramatic predators, ramming themselves into the target to send it hurling into the air, or drowning it by repeatedly pushing it under water.

Experts warn Monday's attack could become more common as both the dolphin and whale populations in the area increase.

Horrific: There is a red tinge in the water where two of the dolphins were eaten and the rest left to die

Drown: Biggs killer whales are known for brutal predator techniques such as repeatedly pushing prey under water

Suddenly it went quiet after a heated and deadly clash between the mammals

Dr Lance Barrett-Lennard told the TV station the number of harbour seals, white-sided dolphins, and Biggs killer whales have soared in the last 20 years.

But, he added, the attack is a necessary balancing of mammals in the area, which has not happened enough in recent times.

He said: 'The fact that this area has recaptured some of its original dynamism in terms of marine mammals, that's a good thing.'
