A sailor has been treated for mild hypothermia overnight, having swum more than nine kilometres to shore after being knocked from his yacht on Sunday afternoon.

Geoffrey Hunter, 62, was sailing the new yacht from Perth to Bunbury, when he allegedly fell overboard and was hit by the yacht's boom.

He’s believed to have spent three hours swimming the five nautical miles to shore.

The man’s daughter, Jasmine, said her father had recently purchased a new yacht and was sailing it home in two legs.

‘He did Perth to Mandurah and then was sailing yesterday from Mandurah to Bunbury’, she told the ABC on Monday morning.

She added that he was a ‘bit bashed about by the rocks as I think he had to get on the rocks on the groyne, but no broken bones or major injuries.’

A groyne is a man-made jetty, built with rocks, designed to reduce erosion.

A spokesperson for Bunbury Regional Hospital told MailOnline that Mr Hunter is now in a stable condition.

Volunteers from Bunbury Sea Rescue sailed the yacht back to shore on Sunday evening.

Mr Hunter was lucky to survive the ordeal, following the death of another sailor near Bunbury in March.

Roger Liebmann, 69, was discovered dead on a damaged 18 foot catamaran, following a large-scale search operation after he was reported missing.
