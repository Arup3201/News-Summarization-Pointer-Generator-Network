A 1962 Nobel prize for the discovery of the structure of DNA has sold at auction for $4.7 million, a world auction record for any Nobel prize.

Christie's says the gold medal won by James Watson was purchased yesterday by a buyer who wished to remain anonymous. The New York City auction house says it's the first Nobel medal to be offered at auction by a living recipient.

Watson made the 1953 discovery with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins.

Watson's 1962 Nobel Prize medal for his role in the discovery of the structure of DNA. Watson made the 1953 discovery with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins; Crick's medal sold in 2004 for $2.2million

Crick's Nobel prize sold last year at Heritage Auctions for $2.2 million. He died in 2004.

Watson had a very public fall from grace in 2007, at the age of 79, after he began making racist and sexiest remarks in the media. The comments led to him being shunned from the scientific community as well as the general public.

He told one Sunday paper he was 'inherently gloomy' about the prospect of Africa because 'all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really.' 

Watson went on to say the divide in intelligence had also been witnessed by people who had black employees.

Later defending the comments, he said he was not 'a racist in a conventional way'.

A short time later Watson was fired from his position as chancellor at Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory. He was also said to have been relieved of his position on a number of boards, and to have not given any public lectures since. 

But his downfall can't only be contributed to his comments on Africa. He has talked-down Rosalind Franklin's contribution to the work on DNA and even said women aren't 'as effective' at science as men. 

Part of the proceeds from the sale will go to the University of Chicago, Clare College Cambridge, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Long Island Land Trust and other charities.
