A man dressed as an elf served customers at a Christmas market while allegedly high on class A drugs.

Sam Briggs filmed himself working on a charity gift-wrapping stall in Watford amid claims that he had taken cocaine, LSD and ketamine.

Officials became concerned when they spotted a ten-minute video on YouTube showing him shaking, gurning, dancing and laughing hysterically as he tries to serve increasingly bewildered customers.

Elf 'on drugs': Sam Briggs, shown here in costume, posted a video saying he was on drugs while running this stall

Service: Mr Briggs wrapped presents for members of the public while allegedly using cocaine, LSD and ketamine

Video: The clip, uploaded to Youtube, has been viewed more than 350,000 times

Police now say they want to visit 
Briggs to give him ‘advice’.

The ten-minute film, entitled ‘Drugs at 
work’, shows him under the alleged influence of each of the three drugs.

He brags that the cocaine makes him feel ‘good’, while the LSD appears 
to put him in a trance and ketamine leaves him trembling before he tells
 a customer: ‘I love you mate.’

Watford Council, which gave Briggs permission to run the stall, said it was ‘appalled’ and was carrying out an investigation.

 Police said there was ‘no physical evidence’ of illegal drug taking in 
the video, which has now been viewed almost 357,000 times on YouTube.

Briggs served dozens of people at the stall, and then posted a video entitled 'Drugs at Work 2' online four days later.

The video, made up of three clips, purports to show him under the effects of cocaine, then LSD and then ketamine while he offers to wrap presents for members of the passers-by.

Cocaine and LSD are Class A drugs, while ketamine is a Class C substance.

At one point in the videos - filmed on December 21 and 22 - he says to the camera he ‘feels a little bit wobbly’, before laughing with customers as he wraps their presents.

During another point in the video he struggles to focus, telling himself: 'Come on Briggs, hold it down.'

He then adds: 'What circumstances have led me to this point in my life?'.

At the start of the video, text explains that : 'The people who allowed us to run the stall had no idea about the drugs. All money raised was genuinely for charity. Don't try this yourself.'

It adds: 'Sam had an elf helper on standby in case anyone under the age of 18 came to the stall.'

The video has received more than 350,000 views since being uploaded to YouTube on Boxing Day.

While police have been alerted to the video, they have said that it contains no 'physical evidence', and that they will only try to 'give advice' to Mr Briggs about what he has posted.

'Appalled': Watford Council, which allowed Mr Briggs to run his stall, issued a statement condemning his actions

A spokesman for Hertfordshire Police said today: 'Police are aware of the video on You Tube and have assessed its content.

'Whilst the video contains no physical evidence of drug taking to suggest a criminal offence has been committed, officers will be seeking to identify and speak to the individual captured on camera to give advice regarding the appropriateness of his videos and supportive commentary.'

A spokesman for Watford Council said: 'Sam Briggs was granted permission to wrap presents at Watford Market over the Christmas period to raise money for charity.

'The request was approved in good faith by Watford Borough Council after receiving the relevant documents required.

'Naturally we are appalled and do not condone the actions of this person and we will be conducting a full investigation into this matter.'

Mr Briggs could not be reached for comment.
