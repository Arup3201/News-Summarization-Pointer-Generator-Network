France's 
far-Right Front National (FN) has been convulsed by a family row after 
founder Jean-Marie Le Pen accused his daughter of leading the party in a
 politically correct direction.

The
 fall-out was sparked at the weekend when M Le Pen made a ‘joke’ in 
which he appeared to suggest that a popular French Jewish singer, 
Patrick Bruel, should be put into an oven.

Marine
 Le Pen accused him of making a ‘political mistake’, and said the 
incident gave her the opportunity ‘to remind people that the FN condemns any form of anti-Semitism in the strongest terms’.

Jean-Marie Le Pen was criticised by Jewish groups and prominent members of his own party over the weekend for the comment made in a video posted on the National Front's website on Friday

Her
 father then hit back by attacking Mlle Le Pen, 45, for turning the 
party into a more mainstream organisation since taking the reins in 2011
 – a policy that led to huge success in the recent European elections, 
when the Front National took first place in France with 25 per cent of 
the vote.

‘I
 consider that the serious political error is made by those who align 
themselves with political correctness,’ the 85-year-old said. ‘They want
 to be like the other parties.’

M
 Le Pen had said Bruel would be part of ‘a batch [of critics] we will 
get next time’ – using the word fournée for batch, evoking the word four
 which means oven in French.

M Le Pen was re-elected as an MEP in the elections, but 
this did not stop him making a pun referring to the Nazi gas chambers 
during World War II.

In a video posted on the FN website, and posted on YouTube, the 85-year-old attacks a number of the party's critics, including pop star Madonna.

When asked about another - the Jewish singer Patrick Bruel - M Le Pen said he would be part of a 'batch next time', while hinting at the word 'oven'.

Thousands of French Jews were sent to German concentration camps during the war, where most were murdered.

A spokesman for SOS Racism, a leading 
Paris civil rights group, described M Le Pen's pun as 'the worst kind 
of anti-Semitic filth'.

Marine Le Pen (pictured, right, in 2011) said her father (left) had made a 'political error' but that the 'meaning given to his comments is a malicious interpretation'

He 
said the group would file a legal complaint against M Le Pen, who 
already has numerous convictions for racism and anti-Semitism, this 
week.

France's Movement 
Against Racism and for Friendship Between Peoples, also said it would 
lodge a complaint, calling M Le Pen 'an authentic anti-Semite'.

M Le Pen handed over the reins of the FN to his daughter, Marine, in 2011, and she has pledged to soften its image.

Although M Le Pen retains significant influence, and Mlle Le Pen remains very loyal to him, other party members attacked him today.

FN vice-president Louis Aliot, who lives with Mlle Le Pen, said it was 'a bad phrase' which was also 'politically stupid and disappointing'.

Gilbert Collard, an FN-affiliated MP, said it was time for the party founder to 'accept [M Le Pen's] retirement'.

Mlle Le Pen said the comment had been misinterpreted, but added that for an experienced politician like her father 'not to have foreseen how this phrase would be interpreted is a political mistake the Front National is [now] paying for.'

Earlier M Le Pen had said: 'If there are people in my camp that have interpreted my comments in this way, they are nothing but imbeciles.'

He denied being anti-Jewish, saying the words he used had 'no anti-Semitic connotation', except for 'political enemies or idiots'. He made it clear that the offending video had now been removed from the web.

M Le Pen, who once described the Nazi gas chambers as a 'detail' of history, was runner up in the French presidential elections of 2002.
