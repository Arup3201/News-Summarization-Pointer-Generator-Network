After weeks of fresh sea air, endless sunshine, and having every whim catered for, it’s little wonder many cruise passengers return home with a sinking feeling.

But it appears they’re weighed down by more than simply post-holiday blues.

Most cruise passengers gain a pound a day in weight during a two-week holiday at sea, according to a poll – coming back a stone heavier than when they left.

All-you-can-eat: Passengers blame the high-class but often calorific dining facilities on board the ship for the extraordinary weight gain

Their broader waistlines are hardly a 
surprise – given the relaxing onboard lifestyle plus mountains of food 
available round the clock.

Many respondents reckoned they put on 
more weight cruising than they do at Christmas, having enjoyed the 
high-class, but often high-calorie and ‘all you can eat’ dining 
facilities offered on most modern vessels.

The findings of the study, by 
independent cruise travel agents Bonvoyage.co.uk, are unlikely to 
encourage anyone watching their weight to sign up for a seaborne 
adventure.

Tempting: Cruise dining often sees passengers indulge in bigger meals than they're used to

They surveyed 1,281 Britons who had 
been on a cruise and found 52 per cent said they put on up to a stone 
during a two-week holiday.

One in 11 (9 per cent) put on around 
4lbs while a further 6 per cent were even worse and put on up to 18lbs.

More than eight in ten (84 per cent) admitted they ate a lot more than 
normal as they sailed the oceans and 31 per cent admitted  they ate 
double their normal calories.

And more than four in ten (41 per cent) struggle to shift the extra weight once they got home.

Steph Curtin, cruise development 
manager of Bonvoyage.co.uk said: ‘I am as guilty as these respondents 
when it comes to indulging when on a cruise holiday, as the delicious 
food and drink on offer can be difficult to say no to.

‘This is particularly the case when on
 an all-inclusive cruise, where you know that all of the tempting food 
on offer has already been paid for.’

Most cruises contain a wide variety
 of eateries, from fine-dining restaurants to fish and chip-style 
takeaways.

Many provide ‘midnight feasts’, while restaurants often stay 
open until the early hours to indulge guests.

Control: It can be hard to say no at the cruise ship buffet lines

Some ships have recognised
 the difficulties for passengers and have begun to offer healthier 
alternatives.

Passenger Rosalie Nunn, 27, from 
Lincoln, joined a world cruise last year and was surprised to find a 
tailor on board whose main job was to adjust clothing that was becoming 
too tight.

She said: ‘The tailor said most people will leave the ship at
 least one dress size bigger.

‘One lady who is a regular cruise-goer
 said she brings larger-sized clothing to accommodate the inevitable 
weight gain.’

She added: ‘The results don’t surprise me – the food is 
constant and you’ve got to be well restrained to resist it.’
