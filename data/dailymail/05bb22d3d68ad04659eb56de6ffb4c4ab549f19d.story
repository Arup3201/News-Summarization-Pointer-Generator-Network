John Carver was sat having a few beers in a bar in Tenerife as he watched Newcastle United beaten by League One Stevenage in the FA Cup third round four years ago – and he wasn’t best pleased.

The current caretaker boss is a lifelong Newcastle fan and was just five years old when they last won a trophy – the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup – in 1969.

Carver takes his United side to Leicester City on Saturday afternoon and, while the club hierarchy have previously played down the importance of the cup competitions, Alan Pardew’s former assistant says he will be naming his strongest XI to win the game.

‘Four years ago, I was in Tenerife watching the game against Stevenage and let me tell you, I was really disappointed - and I had a few beers as well,’ he said. ‘Listen, there has been an awful lot made about cup runs so let me say this: Every game I go into I want to win, so I will put the best team on the pitch that I possibly can to win the game.

‘I know exactly how much it means to the fans to have a cup run because I am one of them.

‘I have been to an FA Cup final and a semi-final and I will never forget that reception. Although we lost to Manchester United in 1999, when we came out of the tunnel at Wembley, with our fans were behind us, it was quite emotional. 

‘So I know exactly what it means. I have actually been in the stands when we lost to Arsenal in the final in 1998, so I know what it is like and how important it is. So to get back there is one of the most important things in my eyes.’

Carver is bidding to win the Newcastle job on a permanent basis but was disappointed with the 3-3 draw at home to Burnley on New Year’s Day, a match in which they surrendered the lead three times.

He does not, however, believe that Saturday's game takes on any added importance given their failure to beat the second-from-bottom Clarets.

‘There’s no extra significance,’ said Carver, who has lost defender Steven Taylor for the remainder of the season with an Achilles injury. ‘I know how important it is to win a Premier League game and how important it is to win an FA Cup match too, so I have not thought of it any differently if we had won, drew or lost against Burnley.

‘I need to see what we have available and I will pick my strongest available side. But if I have three or four players who are carrying things, then that is obviously an issue. The team might pick itself.

‘We have already lost Papiss Cisse to the African Cup of Nations and we are going to lose Cheick Tiote and Mehdi Abeid soon. So that's three players we have lost and with the injury list we have got, we have to deal with it.’
