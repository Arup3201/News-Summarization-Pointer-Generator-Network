A boy in a coma can keep his beloved American Staffordshire dog who has cared for him since birth despite German authorities previously threatening to put the pet down.

Loyal Tascha goes into 10-year-old Dylan Gerzmehle's room every morning and pulls back his blanket with her teeth.

She then licks his feet and snuggles up to his face and remains by his side all day.

'A bond that should never be broken': German authorities are threatening to destroy a Staffordshire Bull Terrier who has been 'caring' for comatose boy Dylan Gerzmehle for the last six years after it bit a neighbour's dog

Devoted: Every morning, Tascha comes into Dylan's room, snuggles up to him and remains by his side all day

But Tascha is a breed classified as a 
fighting dog in the state of Brandenburg near Berlin where Dylan lives 
and last month bit a neighbour during a scrap with another dog.

Authorities said the pet had to move out or be destroyed.

But following huge public outcry and a social media campaign on Facebook which was supported by 100,000 people, they have allowed Tascha to live.

Dylan's parents Eckhard and Barbara were told to 
de-register Tascha in Brandenburg and re-register her in Berlin where 
Staffordshire Terriers are allowed.

Lobbying the mayor: Dylan's father Eckhard (pictured) says Tascha brings his son 'little sparks of happiness'

Dangerous breed: Brandenburg state had turned a blind eye to a law banning Staffordshire Bull Terriers, but it is now ordering Tascha to be relocated or be destroyed

Tascha is now undergoing training as a therapy and companion dog for disabled people.

'We are so happy and thankful, also for the support,' said Dylan's parents after the meeting according to The Local.

Dylan was born into a vegetative state but his condition improved since Tascha arrived as a puppy six years ago.

The family moved to the small town of Schonwalde in Brandenburg from Berlin to give Dylan more peaceful surroundings.

But unlike Berlin, Brandenburg has a dangerous dog breed law that does not permit Staffordshire Terriers.

Until recently, the district had not objected to Tascha as she has been neutered, properly reported and has received training from certified dog trainers. She also has passed temperament tests.

But due to her dogfight with involving the neighbour’s pet the authorities felt that the law should be imposed. 

Outrage: More than 94,000 people have signed a petition on Facebook demanding the decision be reversed
