Dave Bassett believes the tendency of top-flight clubs to employ fashionable foreign managers is holding back the progress of English bosses.

The former Wimbledon and Sheffield United boss made the comments as Sunderland turn to Dutchman Dick Advocaat to turn around the fortunes of the Black Cats.

Just nine English managers are working in the Premier League compared to 15 in 1992 and Basset believes things have changed for the worse.

Bassett told the Mirror: ‘What’s wrong with giving the Sunderland job to an English guy? There are good foreign managers, but there are more than enough good young managers.

‘It’s just that foreign managers are flavour of the month. This fashionable idea that foreign managers are better than English ones is a myth.

‘It’s like foreign players. They move to wherever they can earn the most money. They are not interested in living the dream for that club.

‘All the nonsense of kissing the badge and they are really only interested in kissing their bank balance.’
