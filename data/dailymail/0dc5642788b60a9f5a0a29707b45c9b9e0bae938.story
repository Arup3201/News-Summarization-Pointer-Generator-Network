It's definitely a dog's life for taste tester Lucy Postins after landing a job sampling bowls of pet food, but at least she is guaranteed strong teeth and a nice shiny coat.

While the mere thought of eating dog food is enough to turn most people's stomachs, Ms Postins, originally from the UK but now based in San Diego, USA, says she absolutely loves her job.

Ms Postins, 38, not only
samples every individual ingredient that goes into the food but even 
chows down on the final product - to make sure it tastes just right.

Ms Postins insists on all the recipes being made in a human food facility instead of a pet food rendering plant, and then tests for the likes of flavour, aroma and colour which is an indication of freshness.

Her company The Honest Kitchen was the first pet food manufacturer to achieve a 'human grade' rating from the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) which means the final product is legally allowed to be described as 'human grade' on the product labels.

This is because the ingredients are sourced directly from the human food chain and production takes place alongside 'people foods'.

Teamwork: Ms Postins is both the human taste tester and CEO of pet food company The Honest Kitchen - the first pet food manufacturer to achieve a human grade rating from the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration)

Lucy, who studied in Warwickshire, believes that by producing pet food in this way animals receive stacks of health benefits including improvements to their skin, fur and general immunity.

The dog food - which includes everything from free range chicken, ranch-raised beef and sweet potatoes to eggs, bananas and even dandelion greens - is carefully blended before being mixed with water by the buyer to help bring the mixture together.

CEO Lucy, whose family includes two pet Rhodesian Ridgebacks and a Pug in San Diego in California, USA, said: 'There are a lot of people who think their pets are inferior and don't deserve quality food.

'But so many people are becoming educated on conventional pet food ingredients and production that they want to make a move away from that.

'By actually tasting the food ourselves I think it's a sound way of walking our own talk and helping to assure people we actually mean what we say about product integrity and quality.

'Some of my friends think it's an odd thing to do but most of them have pets they love as much as - or in some cases maybe even more than - their own children so can see where I'm coming from.

'A recent 2013 survey showed 74 percent of customers saw an improvement in the well-being and energy levels of their pets from eating the products.

'And 70 per cent saw an improvement in their pet's skin and coat while 60 per cent noticed an improvement in their pets' weight.

'The proof really is in the pudding and our foods are good enough to eat.'
