The mother of a murdered nine-year-old girl has sued a mental health clinic saying it was in a position to know and prevent the violent tendencies of the teenager who killed her daughter.

Patricia Preiss filed the wrongful death lawsuit against Pathways Behavioral Healthcare, two employees and 18-year-old Alyssa Bustamante, who was convicted in Elizabeth Olten's death.

Bustamante was 15 at the time of the October 2009 slaying in St. Martins, Missouri - a small community just west of Jefferson City.

She was sentenced in February to life in prison with the possibility of parole after pleading guilty to killing Elizabeth.

neighbor Elizabeth Olten (right) because she wanted to know what it felt
like to kill

During Bustamante's sentencing 
hearing in February, Cole County prosecutors and the teenager's public 
defenders presented evidence that Bustamante had cut herself a number of
times and had been hospitalized at the Mid-Missouri Mental Health 
Center in Columbia after a 2007 suicide attempt. She became a Pathways 
client after she was released from the hospital.

Bustamante
admitted in court that she strangled Elizabeth, stabbed her and slit 
her throat, then buried the child in a wooded area behind their homes.

During
the hearing, prosecutors pointed to a journal entry written by 
Bustamante on the night of the slaying in which she described it as an 
'ahmazing' experience. In court, Bustamante apologized for her actions.

The lawsuit by Preiss alleges that Bustamante had indicated to Pathways personnel that she wanted to harm Elizabeth.

Pathways' employees 'were aware of 
the same violent propensities of Bustamante, as well as the specific, 
identifiable threats to harm Olten,' the lawsuit says.

But 'none of these defendants took actions to detain Bustamante' and 
'none warned Olten or Preiss of the specific threat on Olten, nor did 
they take any action that might have prevented Bustamante from harming 
Olten.'

Pathways counselor Ron Wilson, who 
was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, had testified during 
Bustamante's sentencing hearing that she had not indicated she was a 
threat to anyone but herself. The lawsuit also names Pathways 
psychiatrist Niger Sultana as a defendant.

Mel Fetter, president and CEO of Pathways' parent company Compass Health, refused to comment on pending litigation.

The
lawsuit, which was filed October 18, was assigned to Cole County 
Circuit Judge Patricia Joyce, who also presided over Bustamante's 
sentencing hearing. No hearings had been scheduled as of Monday.

Ms Preiss previously filed a separate
wrongful death lawsuit against Karen and Gary Brooke, who are 
Bustamante's grandparents and were her legal guardians at the time of 
Elizabeth's slaying.

St. Louis County Circuit Judge Gloria Reno ordered a $400,000 judgment in that case, after an October 3 hearing.

Prior
to receiving her life sentence in February, Bustamante said to the family of her 
victim: 'If I could give my life to bring her back, I would. I just want
to say I'm sorry for what happened. I'm so sorry.'

Morbid fascination: Bustamante previously attempted 
suicide and was a cutter. Defense attorneys highlighted her troubled childhood as part of their argument about why she 
should receive leniency

Elizabeth's
family members wept as Alyssa made her statement prior to the sentence 
being handed down by Cole County Presiding Judge Patricia Joyce.

The
teenager's defense attorneys had argued for a sentence less than life 
in prison, saying Bustamante's use of the antidepressant Prozac had made
her more prone to violence.

They said she had suffered from depression for years and once attempted suicide by overdosing on painkillers.

But prosecutors sought a longer sentence, describing the 18-year-old as a thrill killer who lacked remorse.

They
noted that Bustamante had dug two graves several days in advance, and 
that on the evening of the killing had sent her younger sister to lure 
Elizabeth outside with an invitation to play.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt 
David Rice testified that the teenager told him 'she wanted to know what
it felt like' to kill someone.

The trial's conclusion follows days of testimony in a small courtroom in Missouri's capital city.

Proceedings
descended into chaos during the trial as prosecutor Mark Richardson made an 
impassioned request for a lifelong sentence for Bustamante.

Her
grandmother and grandfather stormed out of the courtroom, prompting 
Bustamante — who had been staring blankly downward as Richardson 
recounted her crime — to begin silently crying for the first time in her
court proceedings that have spanned more than two years.

As the judge sentenced Bustamante, Elizabeth's grandmother interrupted and cried
out from her wheelchair.

'I
think Alyssa should get out of jail the same day Elizabeth gets out of 
the grave!' declared the grandmother, whom a prosecutor later identified
as Sandy Corn.

The emotional, two-day sentencing hearing highlighted by 
repeated references to words Bustamante had written in her diary on the 
night she strangled, slit the throat and repeatedly stabbed Elizabeth.

Bustamante,
then 15, wrote that it was an 'ahmazing' and 'pretty enjoyable' 
experience, ending the entry by saying: 'I gotta go to church 
now...lol.'

'The motive 
has to be the most senseless, reprehensible that could be in humankind, 
and that is to take a life for a thrill,' Richardson said.

Bustamante's
attorney, Donald Catlett, cited the testimony on Tuesday of mental 
health professionals who described Bustamante as a 'psychologically 
damaged' and 'severely emotionally disturbed' child.

They
recounted her family's history with drug abuse, mental disorders and 
suicide attempts, noting her father was in prison and her mother had 
abandoned her. Her mother was in the courtroom on Tuesday for the first 
time.

Various mental 
health professionals testified over the course of the two-day hearing 
that Bustamante suffers from major depression and displays the features 
of a borderline personality disorder.

Some also said she shows early signs of a bipolar disorder. Bustamante
began taking the antidepressant drug Prozac after a suicide attempt on 
Labor Day 2007 at the start of her eighth grade year.

Her
dosage of the medication had been increased just two weeks before she 
murdered Elizabeth. Bustamante's attorneys presented evidence from a 
psychiatrist who testified that Prozac could have been a 'major 
contributing factor' in the slaying — a theory rejected by a prosecution
psychiatrist who insisted there was no scientific evidence of Prozac 
causing homicides, or even increasing aggression.
