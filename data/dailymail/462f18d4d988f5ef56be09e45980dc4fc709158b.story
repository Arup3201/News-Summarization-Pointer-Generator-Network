Tiger Woods' new girlfriend Lindsey Vonn proved a good luck charm on Thursday after she turned up to watch the golf player for the first time.

Woods finished in touch with the leaders at two under par for the day at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia.

Olympic champion skier Vonn, 28, wore a clinging, sand-colored dress and matching floppy hat with a coordinated tan bag and flat sandals as she kept a close eye on her 37-year-old boyfriend.

She followed the course with friends, despite being hampered by a recent skiing injury, and at times watched the action through binoculars.

The Masters WAGs offered plenty of 
distraction off the course as they showed up to support their golf 
partners at the start of the tournament.

The Olympic champion was firm competition for Canadian pop singer and model Paulina 
Gretzky, the daughter of hockey great Wayne Gretzky, who turned heads 
when she showed up to support her golfer boyfriend, Dustin Johnson on Sunday.

Vonn was accompanied by several female friends and waited on a veranda at the clubhouse while Woods warmed up this morning.

At one point, she sat under an umbrella and rested her foot on a friend's knee.

Sochi.

Lindsey Vonn: A 28-year-old, Olympic gold-medal winning Alpine skier, she was propelled onto magazine covers after she and Tiger Woods announced they were dating via publicity shots posted on their Facebook pages. Her divorce from fellow skier Thomas Vonn was finalized this year. She has posed for Sports Illustrated in her swimsuit and made No. 59 on Maxim's Hot 100 list in 2010.

Paulina Gretzky: The eldest daughter of hockey royalty Wayne Gretzky. She launched a modelling career, appearing on the front cover of Canadian fashion magazine Flare at 17. She has also had several forays into the modelling world, with her song Collecting Dust being featured on MTV reality show Laguna Beach. But it is via Twitter that Paulina, 24, has made a name for herself, posting a steady stream of revealing pictures since 2011. She has been dating golfer Dustin Johnson since last year.

Caroline Wozniacki: The Danish tennis player is ranked 10th in the world. She reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in 2011 and quarter finals of the French Open the previous year. In a Forbes list of highest-paid female athletes in 2011, Wozniacki was No.2 with $12.5million. Among her endorsements are Turkish Airlines business class service, Stella McCartney's tennis line for Adidas and the Compeed Blister Patch. She has been dating Rory McIlroy for almost two years.

Vonn, 28, confirmed that she was dating 37-year-old golfer Woods last month.

The Olympian was married to fellow 
skier Thomas Vonn, but the two divorced in 2011 four 
years after tying the knot.

Woods' past relationships are far 
more sensational.

His marriage of five years to Elin Nordegren collapsed
in 2010 after shocking revelations of multiple extramarital affairs.

The rest of the golf WAGs were out en masse on Wednesday for the traditional Par 3 Contest prior to the start of the Masters Tournament.

Paulina Gretzky opted not to wear the tradition white jumpsuit on the course and chose a pair of white skin-tight jeans and knotted grey tank top as she stood on the sidelines.

Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, girlfriend of Northern Ireland golfer Rory McIlroy joined in with other partners and family members in the traditional dress.

She hit shots on the course before later attending a club dinner with her boyfriend.  

Wozniacki was also seen at the course on Thursday, dressed in head-to-toe white which seemed to have been influenced by her tennis background.

Defending champion Bubba Watson showed off his adorable family on the course on Wednesday afternoon.

The
34-year-old golfer was all smiles as he paraded his 
wife Amy and 13-month-old son Caleb who they adopted as a newborn last 
year.

Watson, of Bagdad, Florida, appeared 
to be in much better spirits on Wednesday after an emotional Tuesday, 
when he choked up during a news conference as he responded to a question
of whether he did 
anything special with the prized green jacket he took away from Augusta 
National.

Choking up and taking a couple of 
minutes to compose himself, 
Watson spoke about the moment an Augusta National member said he could 
keep the famed winner's jacket for a year.

'I
told him that I was going to go home and wrap Caleb up in it,' he said 
about the baby boy he and his wife had adopted a week before last year's
Masters.

'That's the only thing I did with it. Out of respect, out of honor,' he added before having to take another long pause.

Emotions run high just under the 
surface of the fun-loving, daring golfer, who plays his shot-shaping 
game with a singular imagination.

'Out of respect and honor for Augusta
National, as one of greatest clubs we have, as one of greatest 
tournaments, out of respect for them, I didn't do any of my funny antics
that I normally would do,' said Watson.

'Only thing I did was wrap Caleb up in it,' the 34-year-old added, wiping away tears.

Caleb's love of golf, or at least his enthusiasm for getting onto the green, is already apparent despite his young age
