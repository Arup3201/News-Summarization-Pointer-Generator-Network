A contestant on hit reality show Dating Naked is suing VH1's parent company Viacom for $10million, claiming the network failed to blur out her genitals during a wrestling scene.

Jessie Nizewitz, a 28-year-old model from Long Island, New York, said the producers repeatedly assured her none of private parts would be shown in the episode that aired July 31, according to the New York Post.

'I felt lied to, manipulated and used,' she told the paper. 'I was horrified.'

During the scene in question, Ms Nizewitz and her date are throwing a football on the beach and start playfully wrestling in the sand. Her rear is in the air, facing the camera, at the moment when the producers failed to blur. 

After the episode aired, Ms Nizewitz said she immediately started hearing from people who'd seen the 'money shot,' including her parents and grandmother.

And countless viewers posted about Ms Nizewitz on social media. A few even took screen-grabs of the moment and included them in their Tweets.

One man said, 'Yo! They showed this chick's box' and then asked to be part of the show's post-production team. He included a picture of the incident in his post.

On Facebook, a woman said she 'had to pause and rewind and replay in slowmo [sic]' to be sure of what she'd just seen. Another woman said she saw Ms Nizewitz's 'booty hole.'

Uh oh! Viewers of Dating Naked immediately went to the show's Facebook page to report what they'd seen

Beside Viacom (the media company that owns VH1), Ms Nizewitz also names production companies Firelight Entertainment and Lighthearted Entertainment in her suit.

Ms Nizewitz also told the Post that the incident ruined a 'budding relationship.' She said the man she was dating never called her again after the show aired.

'He was employed, Jewish, in his 30s and that’s pretty much ideal,' Nizewitz said.

Dating Naked first aired in July of this year. This was the third episode of the season.
