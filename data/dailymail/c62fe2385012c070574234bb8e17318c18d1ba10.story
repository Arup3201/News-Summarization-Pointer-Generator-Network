Hugo Taylor and Caggie Dunlop, who grew up together in Chelsea and starred in the E4 reality TV show based on their sloaney lifestyle, travelled to Namibia together to curate snaps for Hugo's 'Taylor Morris' sunglasses range - and they're going to auction them off for charity

The reality TV stars flew to the African country to create some beautiful imagery, which will then be turned into an exhibition and auctioned off  to raise money for Malaria No More - the same charity Hugo is running the London marathon for in April.

The trip covered the Sossusvlei Desert and the Skeleton Coast and the shots show the pair enjoying the sun-drenched country.

The trip covered the Sossusvlei Desert and the Skeleton Coast - and the sloaney pair said it was the best week of their lives

They travelled with some old school friends and enjoyed sand surfing, safari and hot air ballooning

From sand surfing and safari to hot air ballooning and champagne breakfasts in the desert, the pair said it was the best week of their lives.

Caggie, 25, who is best friends with Millie Mackintosh, and 29-year-old Hugo also travelled with Charlie Morris, some old school friends and photographer, Grey Hutton. 

Hugo may have left Made In Chelsea years ago but he's gone on to launch one of the most stylish sunglasses ranges on the market.

The brand is already a hit with celebrities - with everyone from Cara Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse, to Rita Ora and even super sloane Pippa Middleton stepping out wearing the shades.

Hugo and Charlie designed the glasses down to the last hinge, and are determined to offer a luxury product at an accessible price.

Caggie, who was famously dating Spencer Matthews, and Hugo, who dated Millie Mackintosh, found fame in the dramatic episodes of E4 show, Made In Chelsea

The photographs will form an exhibition and be sold off the the same charity that Hugo is running the London marathon for in April

Of course, the pair wear Hugo's sunglasses in every shot and he says that he and Charlie have worked tirelessly to ensure every element of Taylor Morris meets their own high standards

Since leaving the E4 reality show back in 2012, Caggie has been focusing on her career as a singer/songwriter and fashion entrepreneur

Speaking about his business venture, Hugo said: 'It has been a wonderful and challenging process.

'It’s one thing conceiving an idea or design in your head but totally different to develop the idea into a tangible, beautiful and well-crafted product.

'We have worked tirelessly to ensure every element of Taylor Morris meets our own high standards.

'A millimetre makes a tremendous difference and our glasses have been designed and redesigned several times to produce a final product we are very proud of.' 

Caggie, seen posing in the desert, has been living it up in Malibu, where she's currently staying

Caggie, seen bonding with the locals, recently launched an online retailer emulating big-hitter ASOS

Since leaving the E4 reality show back in 2012, after being one of its leading figures for the first three series, Caggie - whose real name is Catherine - has been focusing on her career as a singer/songwriter and fashion entrepreneur.

After leaving the programme following her split from Spencer Matthews, she started up her own fashion brand called ISWAI (meaning 'It starts with an idea'), an online retailer emulating big-hitter ASOS.

However, she's clearly enjoying letting her hair down and getting away from her busy schedule as she lives it up in Malibu, where she's currently staying. 

Amber Atherton, Hugo Taylor, Caggie Dunlop and Francis Boulle were among the original 12-strong cast of twenty-somethings in the Made in Chelsea series, which launched in 2011
