A man in Texas with no plans for Thanksgiving has posted an ad on Craigslist offering his services as a prospective date from hell available to attend a family gathering on Thursday and promising to cause a major scene.

Nick Schmidt posted his one-of-a-kind offer in the casual encounters section of Craigslist Nashville on Thursday.

In a post entitled ‘Alone on Thanksgiving? Mad at your dad? Read on…’, Schmidt described himself as a ‘28-year-old felon with no high school degree, and a dirty old van one year younger than me painted like Eddie Van Halen's guitar.’

Speaking to HuffPost Live, Schmidt said he dreamed up his invitation to ‘torment your family’ while joking about his lack of Thanksgiving plans with his co-workers.

Originally from Kansas, Schmidt works as a sous chef at Holiday Inn Nashville Airport.

In his Craiglist ad, Schmidt said he ‘can play anywhere between the ages of 20 and 29 depending on if i shave’ and listed a series of hilarious scenarios that he is willing to stage. These included:

Schmidt ended his comedy ad by claiming that he would require no fee for his boyfriend from hell routine save for his thanksgiving diner.

The Craigslist ad was made as a joke, but it has proved Schmidt with a real response and he has found a woman eager to take him home to meet the family.

In his comedy Craigslist ad Schmidt promised to provoke family members by discussing politics and religion

‘I got a real response the next day offering me to come to this girl's Thanksgiving get-together with her roommate and friends, and then go over to her parent's house, eat food, shoot guns, have a good time,’ he told HuffPost Live on Tuesday.

‘So I took her up on it and we still have the plans set.’

‘She offered to drive and everything,’ added Scmidt, who has 'don't hire' tattooed across his knuckles.

He has promised to live tweet about his Thanksgiving experience at @nickyistaken.

It's Thanksgiving. 

Want to skip that long, insulting conversation about how you're still single? About how your parents really want more grand children? Well, look no further!

I am a 28 year old felon with no high school degree, and a dirty old van one year younger than me painted like Eddie Van Halen's guitar. 

I can play anywhere between the ages of 20 and 29 depending on if i shave. I'm a line cook and work late nights at a bar. 

If you'd like to have me as your strictly platonic date for Thanksgiving, but have me pretend to be in a very long or serious relationship with you, to torment your family, I'm game.

I can do these things, at your request:

Start an actual, physical fight with a family member, either inside or on the front lawn for all the neighbors to see.

I require no pay but the free meal i will receive as a guest!
