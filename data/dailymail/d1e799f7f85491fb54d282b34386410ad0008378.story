George Zimmerman has been accused of molesting a young girl for a decade when they were children, according to prosecution records released today.

A young woman, identified only as witness 9, told prosecutors that Zimmerman, who is two years older than her, began abusing her when she was six and stopped when she was 16.

'He would put his hands under my pants, under my underwear,' the witness says, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Accused: George Zimmerman, who is accused of murdering teen Trayvon Martin, molested a young girl for a decade, the prosecution has said as part of a new set of newly-released evidence

The claim is part of a new set of evidence released by Special Prosecutor Angela Corey.

She released witness 9's statement in addition to 120 recorded jail phone calls made by Zimmerman when he was in the Seminole County Jail after being charged over the murder of Trayvon Martin.

The witness contacted authorities in Sanford, Florida after the February 26 killing and subsequent news coverage.

She told prosecutors the sexual abuse began when her parents 
were moving to another state and she and her sister stayed 
with Zimmerman and his family in Virginia.

She said the abuse occurred as they watched TV and he reached under the blankets to touch her.

'I would try to push him off, but he was
bigger and stronger and older,' she said.

On at least one occasion, when she was 12, he also forced her to touch him, she said.

In a recorded statement, a woman identified only as Witness 9 said:

'It started when I was six. He almost two years older than I am and my parents were moving... and they sent us up to [Zimmerman's home].

'We would watch movies in front of the TV and we would have pillows and blankets, and he would reach under the blankets and try to do things. I would try to push him off but he was bigger and stronger and older, and it was in front of everybody.

'I don't know how I didn't say anything but I just didn't know anything.

'He would put his hands under my pants, under my underwear. Before he left any place he would say we weren't doing anything, we were just laying down. I didn't know, I was a kid.

'[The next incident was] behind the curtains in my living room. I was at least seven or eight.

'Every time that we would go up there I could just look at him and he would give me a certain look and I would just know if it was going to happen.

'It's not just me that he did these things to but I know [the other victim] would never come forward. She said she would deny it either way.

'He always was just very charming and personable with everyone. But he was different behind closed doors with me.

'For the first time in my life, I'm not afraid of him.'

In the last encounter, he 
ordered her to lay on a bed beside him and began massaging her. When she felt that he was aroused, she ran from the house.

Later, she and her parents
confronted him at a restaurant, and he said he was sorry, she claimed.

She added: 'He always was just, you 
know, very charming and personable with everyone... and just would laugh
and entertain everybody. But he was different behind closed doors with 
me.'

Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, had argued that the witness's interview with police should not be released.

O'Mara said the statement 'is not relevant' to the shooting of Martin and would 'serve to reignite and potentially enhance the widespread public hostility toward Mr. Zimmerman,' the Sentinel reported.

According to the transcript Witness 9 also told Sanford police that Zimmerman does not like blacks.

In the audio-recorded interview 
released today, she reiterated her claim but did not go into any detail 
of why she made the assumption.

Zimmerman's family, she said, 'don't 
like black people if they don't act like white people. They like black 
people if they act white'.

When asked if she witnessed Zimmerman disparage blacks or act as if he hated blacks, she replied: 'No'.

The allegations against 28-year-old 
Zimmerman are the latest twist since his arrest over the death of 
17-year-old Martin following a confrontation in February in Sanford, 
Florida.

Zimmerman claims he acted in self defense and cited Florida's 'stand your ground' law as an explanation for the killing.

Prosecutors say Zimmerman assumed Trayvon was about to commit a crime, followed him then murdered him.

Lawyers
for Zimmerman unsuccessfully tried to block the jail calls from being 
released following applications by the media, including the Orlando 
Sentinel.

It was from 
calls made from the county jail that led to Zimmerman's bail being 
revoked after it was found he had lied about his finances. The judge set a new bail of $1 million.

But fewer than 24 hours later, he was free after posting the $1 million bail raised by his defense support fun. He is now awaiting trial.

Legal experts said it was unlikely witness 9's statement will be used in any trial as it is too prejudicial.
