The mystery surrounding the death of David Hockney's personal assistant has deepened after a post-mortem examination failed to determine how he died.

Dominic Elliott, 23, died in hospital on Sunday morning after being taken ill at the artist's house in Bridlington, East Yorkshire on Saturday night.

The keen rugby player, who was a close friend of Mr Hockney, is said to have had a family history of heart disease, but the post-mortem did not find 'obvious natural causes' for the young man's sudden death.

A spokesman for Humberside Police 
said today: 'A post-mortem examination was carried out on the body of 
23-year-old Dominic Elliott yesterday at Hull Royal Infirmary mortuary 
and it showed no obvious natural causes for his death.

'Further tests will now be carried out, the results of which will not be known for some weeks.

'Mr Elliott's family has been fully updated by Humberside Police.'

Officers are continuing to 
investigate how Mr Elliott became ill before he was taken to Scarborough
Hospital, apparently by Mr Hockney's partner John Fitzherbert.

He worked as a personal assistant to 
the 75-year-old painter, setting up equipment and helping in his studio,
and was the subject of more than one portrait by the artist.

Mr Elliott had been out with friends 
and was staying at the house overnight when he was taken ill and driven 
to hospital, where he died.

It is not known whether Mr Hockney was
at the property in Bridlington when Mr Elliott 
collapsed, but he is understood to be in the UK and not at his Los 
Angeles residence.

Mr Hockney, who is worth around 
£37million, is likely to be interviewed by police along with Mr 
Elliott’s friends and colleagues.

A police spokesman said: ‘This is a 
sudden death and we will have to speak to people who worked or lived 
with the person who died, whether a world famous artist or a next door 
neighbour.’

Mr Elliott, who worked full-time for 
the artist and had even featured in a portrait painted by him, was a 
keen rugby player and described as ‘big, strong and fit’.

But his GP father died of a heart 
attack in 2001 aged only 42 and Mr Elliott had in the past complained of
chest pains. 

Doctors had warned him to curb his drinking over fears he
may have the same heart condition as his father, a friend said.

Police said there were no signs of 
violence at Mr Hockney’s house.

Mr Fitzherbert, who is in his early 60s,
is reported to have driven Mr Elliott 20 miles to Scarborough General 
Hospital.

He was said to have been ‘vomiting’ 
and seriously ill  when he arrived at casualty at 6am on Sunday.

He died
shortly afterwards and hospital staff contacted Humberside Police.

Officers spent several hours at the house on Sunday morning and are 
understood to have spoken to Mr Hockney, 75.

A police spokesman said they were ‘undertaking 
enquiries to establish events leading to the death’.

Mr Elliott, who had known Mr Hockney 
since childhood, began working for him as a full-time general studio 
assistant about two years ago after quitting his university course.

Mr Hockney’s spokesman Erica Bolton 
said the artist was ‘incredibly upset’, adding: ‘He is, like everyone 
else, in a state of shock.’ She said Mr Elliott was ‘a very important 
person’ to Mr Hockney.

Mr Elliott lived in a shared flat in 
Bridlington and his solicitor mother Karen Kent lives in a bungalow on 
the outskirts of the town.

He had two sisters – Beth, 25, and Poppy, 21 –
and a 13-year-old brother, Max.

Bradford-born David Hockney's colourful paintings often showcase landscape of his native Yorkshire or his adopted home in California.

Hockney was an important 
contributor to the Pop Art movement of the 1960s and one of the most 
influential British artists of the 20th century.

He was the subject of a major exhibition at the Royal Academy in London last year with an exhibition of his large scale landscapes.

The artist is famous for artworks such as A Bigger Splash, a vivid depiction of a Los Angeles swimming pool, and the portrait Mr And Mrs Clark And Percy.

In recent years he has been exploring the possibilities of using an iPad for his artworks.

His print from 2008 of 'Dominic Elliott' (seen above) shows his ginger-haired assistant dressed in blue trousers and short sleeve top sat on a chair, staring straight ahead.

His grandmother Betty Kent, 84, from 
Boston, Lincolnshire, said Mr Elliott had been out with ‘arty types’ on 
Saturday night.

She said: ‘He’d been to his mother’s in the afternoon as
his washing machine was broken and he needed his clothes as he was 
going out with his mates.’

Mr Elliott’s grandfather Walter Elliott, 83, said: ‘I don’t know what happened. My suspicion is he had too much to drink.’

Mr Elliott was a trusted assistant who had keys to Mr Hockney’s house as much of the artist’s work was based from there.

‘He didn’t live with David but he was 
there a lot and often stayed over,’ said the grandfather. ‘I think David
very much looked on Dominic as a son.

‘I’ve been told Dominic was at a party
the night before he was taken ill. I don’t know whether the party was 
at David’s house or somewhere else.’

Mr Hockney is widely regarded as 
Britain’s greatest living artist.

His exhibition last year at  the Royal
Academy of Arts in London attracted more than 500,000 visitors.

Art gallery boss and painter Alan 
Stuttle, 74, who attended the Royal College of Art in London with Mr 
Hockney, said the tragedy will have hit the artist ‘like a 
sledgehammer’, adding: ‘He will learn to live with it. But he will never
get over it. He is such a caring man.’
