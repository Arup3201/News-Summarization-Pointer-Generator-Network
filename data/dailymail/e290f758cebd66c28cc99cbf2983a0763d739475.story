Ben Seewald, the staunch Christian boyfriend of 19 Kids and Counting star Jessa Duggar, 21, has been forced to delete an anti-Catholic rant he posted to his Facebook page last week, after it caused a social media storm, reports RadarOnline.

The 19-year-old, from Hot Springs, Arkansas, vented his 'problem' with the Catholic faith, slamming the religion for suggesting that Jesus' mother Mary was a 'sinless being,' and quoting scripture to support his views.

'Where [Catholics] depart from Scripture, I will in no way support, but will call them out because I love them and desire that they be turned from their deadly errors,' the frothy diatribe read.

'I have nothing against individuals who are Catholic,' the post read. 'I know a lot of Catholics who are great people. What I DO have a problem with is the teaching that man can merit God’s favor through his own works or the works of other fallen men.'

It continued: 'I DO have a problem with the teaching that man can come to God through Mary or any other person besides Jesus . . . I DO have a problem with the deification of Mary as a sinless being.

'Mary herself admitted her need for a Savior. If she had no sin, she would need no Savior.'

Readers were quick to respond to Ben's post - not the first aggressive religion rant he has shared to the social media site.

'Ben is the worst. He is just the worst,' one user commented. 'This kind of ‘Christian love’ is one of the most sickening sentiments on the planet.

'It’s demeaning, it’s condescending, it’s self-aggrandizing and it turns my stomach.'

Many users pointed out the various errors in his Bible references, with one writing: 'You post your almighty preachings as if you know the real truth.

'Where [Catholics] depart from Scripture,
 I will in no way support, but will call them out because I love them 
and desire that they be turned from their deadly errors'

'But, then people point out your numerous mistakes, you take your post down or just erase all the negative things. Grow up boy and face the truth.'

Not long afterwards, Mr Seewald did indeed erase the post. He has since shared a post about 'Abortion. America's Silent Killer,' - another one of his preferred subjects to proselytize.

He followed this up with a somewhat less inflammatory passage of advice, which reads: 'As followers of Jesus, we know the compassion he has shown us - show that to others. May God shine through us to brighten another's world.'

According to the Duggar family's views on dating, Jessa and Ben are just 'courting' for now, which means they refrain from kissing or holding hands and always have a chaperone on dates.

The Duggars, from Tontitown, Arkansas, see courting as a couple deciding whether marriage is appropriate while in a group setting with both of their families.

Only once they have committed to their engagement are they permitted to hold hands for the first time, but they will have to wait until their wedding day before sharing their first kiss.

The Duggar family are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement which teaches that 'children are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.'

Addressing their critics, Jim Bob once said: 'People think we are overpopulating the world [but] we are following our convictions.'
