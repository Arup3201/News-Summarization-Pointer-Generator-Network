The dream of buying a property and living abroad is no longer an option for the average British person, according to experts.

The rising cost of living means that retirees looking for a new life abroad could be in for a nasty shock, with the dream of becoming an expat branded 'a luxury' by one specialist company.

European destinations are more expensive than ever before and some expat hotspots, such as Canada and New Zealand, are even pricier than living in the UK.

New life: The dream of moving abroad to retire is now 'a luxury' according to expat experts

According to the annual Overseas Living Price Index, Britain is still a more expensive place to live than the most popular European retirement hotspots.

1.   Spain - 65.82.   Italy - 77.33.   USA - 77.94.   Turkey - 78.65.   Portugal - 80.86.   France - 89.57.   Cyprus - 95.78.   UK - 1009.   New Zealand - 113.610. Canada - 126.2

But countries like France and Cyprus are only marginally cheaper and Canada and New Zealand are significantly more expensive.

If the UK equals 100 on the index, then Spain is the cheapest destination for expats with a value of 65.8.

The cost of living jumps to 77.3 on the scale for the second 'cheapest' country Italy, with the US and Turkey not far behind.

Canada is the most expensive at 126.2 on the scale, compared to the UK at 100.

There are an estimated 4.7 million UK citizens currently living abroad, with 173,000 in France, 411,000 in Spain and 675,000 in Canada.

The price index looks at the costs of basics in each country, such as fuel, utility bills, supermarket shopping, public transport and eating out.

For instance Turkey has particularly low prices for everyday groceries like milk and bread and cheap public transport.

On the rise: Utilities in France can be higher than in the UK according to experts The Overseas Guides Company

But France charges the most for electricity and gas which, overall, means it is only slightly cheaper to live their than in Britain, said the guide.

Portugal has the cheapest beer and is good value when eating out, along with Italy but Italy has high petrol prices.

Canada and America charge the most for alcohol, even more than in Britain, but petrol is cheaper.However
 public transport costs are high in Canada and New Zealand along with 
grocery shopping, while many utility bills are cheaper.

Richard Way, editor of Overseas Guides Company - which specialises in buying homes abroad - warned: 'Headlines about the benefits of emigrating to escape the UK's poor economy and job market could be misleading for the average Briton, especially those who fail to do proper research into their preferred destination and costs before leaving.

'A
 combination of a weak pound and high cost of living mean that these 
days emigrating to some countries can be more of a luxury than an option
 for the average British person.'

Living
 abroad has previously been seen as a cheaper option for many wanting to
 sell up and retire, and TV shows like A Place in the Sun have 
highlighted popular areas.

Home from home: The Foreign Office has also launched a campaign, warning people to investigate the costs of moving abroad

The new information comes just months after the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) started a campaign to warn Britons about the hidden financial issues expats can experience abroad.

Launching the campaign, FCO Minister 
Mark Simmonds explained: 'The appeal of warmer climates and experiencing
 different countries and cultures is strong for many British citizens. 
We want to pave the way for our expatriates to have the best experience 
possible when they move abroad.

'Our
 consular staff across the world have dealt with a high number of 
British expats requiring assistance for financial issues – whether as a 
result of a house purchase gone wrong, having inadequate funds to pay 
for medical bills or experiencing some other misfortune that has 
resulted in financial hardship.'

Fresh produce: Countries such as France and Spain are still cheaper for groceries, but other costs can mount up

The FCO staff confirmed it has had to help British expatriates with issues including property disputes, bankruptcy caused by changes in personal circumstances, pension complications and unexpected health issues.

A recent FCO report also suggests that high hospitalisation and death rates occur in areas where large numbers of elderly British nationals reside, notably in Europe and South East Asia.
