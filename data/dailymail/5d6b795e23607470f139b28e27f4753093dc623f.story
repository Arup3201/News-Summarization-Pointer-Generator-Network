Police have no idea where he is: Murderer Robert Donovan (above) has been on the run since fleeing an open prison four years ago

Police were under fire last night for 
taking four years to warn the public that a dangerous murderer was on 
the run from an open prison.

Robert Donovan, who was convicted of stabbing a West End theatre manager to death, walked out of Ford prison in June 2010.

Police
 considered him so dangerous that he should not be approached by the 
public, but not a single appeal was made for help catching him until 
yesterday.

Donovan, 57, had 
been in open conditions for less than a year when he absconded from the 
prison near Arundel, West Sussex.

Officers said they had decided to act 
only after concluding he was probably no longer in the county.

Tory
 MP Philip Davies, who has campaigned for tighter rules on open prisons,
 said: ‘It is quite extraordinary that this is only just coming to light
 now. The public should have been informed straight away.

‘People
 need to know for their own safety. If the authorities had to make an 
announcement every time somebody absconded, I suspect a much more robust
 system would soon be put in place.’

Donovan
 was jailed indefinitely at the Old Bailey in December 1974 for a crime 
that shocked the nation.

The sentence – in this case, the juvenile 
equivalent of a life term – meant he would be detained until the prison 
authorities decided it was safe to release him. 

He was 17 when he and his brother Patrick, 19, and David Baillie, 17, killed Palladium stage manager Edwin Thornley.

Prosecutors
 claimed Patrick posed as a rent boy to lure Mr Thornley. He was robbed 
before being fatally stabbed in the neck with a flick-knife on 
Hungerford Bridge over the Thames.

All
 three youths admitted robbing him. Robert Donovan was convicted of 
murder. The other two were convicted of manslaughter and jailed for up 
to six years.

Absconded: Donovan was moved to Ford Prison near Arundel, West Sussex, and left there on day release on June 19, 2010, police said

The fact that 
Donovan has been at large for four years was made public by Sussex 
Police just 24 hours after the Mail revealed how murderer David Richards
 was able to walk out of jail and go on the run for nine years.

The
 disappearance of the 53-year-old Hell’s Angel should have triggered a 
manhunt after he absconded from an open prison in Derbyshire in 2005, 
but local police refused to look for him and did not alert the public.

Back in jail: Michael 'Skull Cracker' Wheatley

He
 was able to reinvent himself as a respectable member of society, 
renting a flat, claiming thousands in benefits, getting a passport and 
going to Ireland on holiday. Richards, who murdered teenager Michael 
Groves in 1984, was recaptured only after the Mail was tipped off about 
him, traced his whereabouts and spent a week urging police to act.

It was left to the Metropolitan Police, which dealt with his murder, to travel to Wolverhampton and arrest him.

Finally
 making a public appeal yesterday for Donovan’s capture, PC Steve Reed, 
from Sussex Police, said: ‘We have been looking for Donovan for several 
years without success, which suggests he has left Sussex and could be 
elsewhere in the country. We need to speak to anyone who could have any 
idea where he is or where he could be.’

He
 added: ‘There is nothing to suggest Donovan is currently a danger to 
the public, but he has not served his sentence, so we want to get him 
back into custody so justice can be done.’

Donovan
 was said to have links to London and the Midlands, and may have family 
in Portsmouth, according to police. He may also be using the alias David
 Green.

Sussex Police said: ‘If you see Donovan, do not approach him but call 999 immediately.’

Last
 month Michael Wheatley, 55, an armed robber known as the Skull Cracker,
 walked out of an open prison in Kent and held up a building society in 
Surrey before being recaptured.

Ministers said inmates should no longer be kept in open conditions or given a temporary release if they had absconded before.
