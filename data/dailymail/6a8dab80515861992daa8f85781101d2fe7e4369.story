The court heard that Slavica Ecclestone, right, has been paying her ex-husband Bernie, left, £90 million a year since their divorce in 2009

Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone is being paid £60 million a year by his ex-wife Slavica as part of their 2009 divorce, court documents have shown.

Details of the divorce emerged during Mr Ecclestone's trial in Munich where he is accused of  paying a German banker a £27.5 million bribe.

German prosecutors claim that Mr Ecclestone paid Gerhard Gribkowsky who was in charge of selling shares in F1 on behalf of Bayern LB bank.

The payment, prosecutors allege was to guarantee that the 47 percent share in the F1 business was sold to Mr Ecclestone's preferred bidder CVC Capital partners for £685 million.

The details were included in a 256-page indictment which show that Mr Ecclestone has received £300 million from his ex-wife since the split.

The indictment, reported by the Sunday Telegraph said: 'Since his divorce from his wife, the accused has received payments on the basis of the British decree nisi.

'The payments amount to around $100 million a year. The duration of the payments from the divorce decree is not known.'

Prosecutors claim that the payments come from an off-shore trust established by Mr Ecclestone in 1997 in the name of his then-wife Slavica and their two daughters Tamara and Petra.

Mr Ecclestone set up the Liechtenstein based trust fund after he suffered a heart scare to protect his wife, who was not living in the UK for long enough for tax purposes, from paying inheritance and capital gains tax in the event of his death.

The Forumla One boss admits that he paid Gribkowsky £27.5 million, not as a bribe but because he was being blackmailed by the banker.

Mr Ecclestone's lawyers read a four-hour long statement at the start of his trial on Thursday, which is expected to last until September.

The trial is only sitting for one or two days a week in order for Mr Ecclestone to continue with his Formula One duties.

In the statement, Mr Ecclestone rejected any suggestions that he had bribed the banker and said he was 'grateful' to be able to tell his own side of the story.

If convicted of bribery and incitement to breach of trust charges, the billionaire faces up to 10 years in prison.

Gribkowsky is currently serving an eight-year jail term for taking the cash. 

Prosecutors claim that Gribkowsky was in charge of selling a 47 percent share in Formula One held by Munich bank Bayern LB.

They allege that Mr Ecclestone paid Gribkowsky the cash so the bank would sell their share of the Formula One business to the billionaire's preferred bidder, CVC Capital Partners for £685 million.

During his personal statement to the court, Mr Ecclestone said the trust fund was owned and controlled by his ex-wife and two daughters. He said that he did not own the trust fund and if Gribkowsky had approached UK tax authorities he could have faced a tax bill which he would not have been able to pay.

He said: 'From today's point of view, it was not a rational decision. I saw my life's work in danger.'

Mr Ecclestone revealed that he has not owned any part of the Formula One series since 1997 although he still runs the day-to-day business.

He insisted that he had been 'blackmailed' by Gribkowsky claiming 'the alleged bribe has not occurred'. 

Mr Ecclestone said it was cheaper to pay Gribkowsky than fight his untrue allegation.
