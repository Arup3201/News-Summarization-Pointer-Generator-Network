It was Ladies Night at the Baltic Inn and 150 women had packed into the pub to see Fabio the male stripper in all his glory.

But muscular Fabio had to cancel at the last minute and was replaced by novice Leon Zbudowskyj.

Unfortunately Mr Zbudowskyj fell far short of the audience’s expectations. He was scruffy, thin, had no six-pack and looked as though ‘he had been hit in the face with a wok’.

Unsatisfied: The crowd was expecting heart-throb Fabio, left, but instead got 'dirty' Leon Zbudowskyj, right

High hopes: The crowd had paid £10 each to see sexy Fabio at the Baltic Inn, but he was forced to cancel

What’s more, he had no act to speak of
either, and very soon the crowd was hurling abuse and screwed up 
napkins in his direction.

Just when it seemed that the  
£10-a-head evening could get no worse the stripper, provoked by  the 
abuse, apparently plunged into the crowd and started attacking the 
women.

Five police cars were sent to break up
the scuffles at the Baltic, at Pontyates, near Llanelli, South Wales 
and 29-year-old Zbudowskyj was arrested on suspicion of assault.

Compere Debra Jones said: ‘He was diabolical, he was disgusting, he just didn’t have anything, no music, no dance routine.

'Diabolical': Replacement Zbudowskyj (pictured) was not quite what the women wanted to see

‘He looked like he had come off the 
street, he looked dirty, he was unshaven and he didn’t have a six pack. 
In fact, he looked like he had been hit in the face with a wok.

'He just 
wasn’t the sort of person you’d want to see take their kit off.’

Posters for the Ladies Night showed a 
photograph of experienced stripper Fabio.

But Fabio cancelled at the 
last minute and an agency, Fantasy Strip, sent Mr Zbudowskyj as a 
replacement.

Inadequate: Unlike experienced Fabio, left, the stand-in had no six-pack, music or dance routine

Bizarre: Zbudowskyj, who dressed as a fireman, allegedly spat cream at the women in The Baltic Inn, Llanelli

Offended: When the women made it clear they would have preferred Fabio, left, Zbudowskyj lost his temper

'Disgusting': The sceptical women heckled the fireman and threw screwed up serviettes at him

Whose round? Zbudowskyj allegedly dived into the audience, sparking a mass brawl

Mr Zbudowskyj, who describes himself 
on Facebook as an ‘entrepreneur’, was due to be paid £150 for the show 
and stomped on stage dressed as a fireman.

But the uniform didn’t fit 
and his performance was far from smouldering.

The crowd, expecting a Full 
Monty-style show, began heckling after Mr Zbudowskyj allegedly spat 
frothy cream at them and then sat on a chair in the middle of the stage.

Miss Jones said: ‘He didn’t move, he just glared at the audience. The 
women started booing and they then started scrunching up serviettes and 
throwing them at him.’

Viv Davies, 58, who has owned the 
country inn for seven years, said the disastrous evening had not put her
off hosting a similar night.

‘We have even set a date for the next 
one – although I think we may steer away from firemen next time,’ she 
said. The Fantasy Strip agency said it will not be working with Mr 
Zbudowskyj again.

A spokesman said: ‘It was the first time we had used him and he let us down big time.

‘We have warned other agencies to stay away from him as he will mess up their bookings and damage their reputations.’

Mr Zbudowskyj, of Cathays, Cardiff, who has been released on police bail pending further inquiries, was unavailable for comment.
