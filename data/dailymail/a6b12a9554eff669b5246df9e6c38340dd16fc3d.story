Sir Jeremy Heywood has been asked to urgently set out who will be Prime Minister after the General Election, if there is a hung parliament

Britain's top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood has been asked to urgently set out who will be Prime Minister after the General Election, if there is a hung parliament.

MPs have warned that the increasing likelihood of neither the Tories nor Labour winning a majority on May 7, means that the public must be told what 'the rules of the game' are.

But they risk controversy by calling for the all-powerful Cabinet Secretary to clarify whether David Cameron will remain in office until a new Government is formed and what his powers would be.

In 2010, then prime minister Gordon Brown was accused of 'squatting' in Downing Street for five days after the election, until the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were able to form a coalition.

And five years on, MPs on the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee say in a report out today that there is 'continuing dispute' what the rules are if there is no overall winner.

While these decisions should be made by cabinet ministers, the MPs note that no minister has responsibility for updating the Cabinet Manual, the book which lays out all government procedure.

They recommend that despite confusion over the role of the incumbent prime minister who stays on, there principle that there 'must always be a government…is unambiguous'.

The convention is that the previous prime minister does not offer their resignation straight away, due to the need to have a Government in office in case 'of a natural disaster or another meltdown in the Eurozone or some foreign policy or military emergency in the Balkans or the Middle East where we need a Government that can act', it is explained in the report.

But the MPs note that this is not set in stone and 'it remains to be seen whether or not these examples will be regarded in future as having established a constitutional convention.'

'For the benefit of the media and the general public, the Cabinet Secretary should set out clearly, and well in advance of the forthcoming general election, the Government's view of the constitutional principles which underpin the continuance in office or otherwise of administrations following a general election', the report says.

Polls suggest the Conservatives and Labour are neck and neck, with both facing the possibility of ending up as the largest party

Polls suggest Labour and the Conservatives are neck and neck, with both facing the possibility of ending up as the largest party, but needing to negotiate a coalition with one or even two other parties.

The report says the public must be clear on what the rules are, so they will expect the incumbent leader to stay on until an alternative government is a position to ask the Queen to take office.

Committee chair Graham Allen MP said: 'For example, in the aftermath of the 2010 election, as the makeup of the new coalition Government was being negotiated, the conventions governing when the sitting Prime Minister should resign were not clear and poorly communicated.

'In the absence of a written constitution these things are governed by convention, so you can see how in some circumstances an impasse or power vacuum could arise. It would be much better to have clarity, and to have the rules of the game clearly set out.'

The report notes: 'It is surely vital to a properly-functioning democracy that the public has access to clear, objective and unambiguous information about the process whereby administrations are formed and the roles of the key players.'
