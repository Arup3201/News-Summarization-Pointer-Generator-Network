Using confidential patient information from a controversial new NHS database for commercial purposes is to be barred in law.

In an attempt to rescue the scheme, which has stalled amid widespread concern about potential threats to privacy, Jeremy Hunt will next week unveil a series of concessions.

Crucially, the Health Secretary will promise legislation to prevent personal information being shared for any ‘purely commercial’ purpose, for example with insurance firms.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will next week unveil a series of concessions to the Care.data scheme. He will promise legislation to prevent personal information being used for 'purely commercial' purposes, for example with insurance firms

A requirement that a patient’s opt-out must be respected will also be written into statute. 

Critics will welcome the concessions – but many insist the Government should go further and give patients the right to opt in, rather than requiring them to make the effort to opt out.

The Daily Mail has repeatedly highlighted growing concerns among GPs and patients over the Care.data project, which was due to begin next month. Unless patients choose to opt out, confidential information about their illnesses, test results and medication will automatically be uploaded from their GP file to a central database. 

Data to be extracted from GP systems includes family history, vaccinations, referrals for treatment, diagnoses and information about prescriptions.

Officials behind the £50million scheme say it will improve healthcare and promote medical advances, with  researchers using the information to spot trends and identify poor care.

But critics have raised concerns that the data could be misused – for instance, by firms providing health care insurance and life cover or trying to target particular products.

Now, in a significant move, government sources said new legislation would be introduced to prevent the Health and Social Care Information Centre from sharing personal information where there is not a ‘clear health or care benefit for people’.

Anyone wishing to use the data will have to demonstrate an ‘ethical basis’ on which to do so before any application can be considered.

This, the source said, puts ‘beyond doubt’ that identifiable or potentially identifiable patient data could be released to firms. Such a use of the information is expected to become an offence under data protection law.

There will also be legislation to beef up the powers of an expert committee that advises Mr Hunt on releasing identifiable or potentially identifiable patient data.

Dr Gordon Gancz, of King Edward Street surgery, Oxford, said: 'Jeremy Hunt is still missing the point though. The scheme still puts the onus on the public to opt out if they do not wish to be a part of this'

A source close to the Health Secretary said: ‘The principles around this programme, which will bring real benefits to patients, are fundamentally right, and we completely support them.

‘But, alongside a new campaign from NHS England to explain the programme to the public and GPs, we also need to ensure that robust legislation is in place to address their concerns.’

Mr Hunt is understood to accept that certain critics, including some GPs, will still be unhappy, but argues an opt-in system would be pointless due to an expected lack of take-up.

But one doctor, whose practice was threatened with closure for vowing to opt his patients out of the scheme, called on Mr Hunt to introduce an opt-in system.

Dr Gordon Gancz, of King Edward Street surgery, Oxford, said: ‘At least by putting it on a statutory basis the Government will reassure many of those who have doubts.

‘Jeremy Hunt is still missing the point though. The scheme still puts the onus on the public to opt out if they do not wish to be a part of this, rather than reversing it and saying, “If you are happy with these conditions, please opt in”.’
