Award winning author Jeanette Winterson caused outrage online after she put a snap of a rabbit she had killed and skinned

Jeanette Winterson has long championed the joys of eating only the freshest organic produce.

So perhaps the novelist’s online followers should not have been surprised when she posted a picture of a skinned rabbit she had caught and killed and was about to eat – because it was nibbling her parsley.

But her actions caused fury, particularly after she told her 32,700 Twitter followers that its head would make a great glove puppet.

The 54-year-old author of Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit insisted the unfortunate bunny was trapped humanely before being cooked in cider with rosemary and thyme.

However, she then risked further controversy by uploading a photograph of her cat finishing off its entrails.

Miss Winterson posted the first picture of the skinned animal on a worktop – thought to be at her Cotswolds cottage – with the caption: ‘Rabbit ate my parsley. I am eating the rabbit.’

Asked by one follower how she had caught it, Winterson replied: ‘In a trap next to the parsley bed.

The skin which includes the head makes a great glove puppet.’

Shots of the meat bubbling on her Aga followed, but her tweets began to attract angry responses from followers. Jacqueline Looker wrote: ‘Before I unfollow you, you make me sick. I will never again read a word you write. Rest in peace, little rabbit.’

Winterson replied: ‘Do you only read vegetarians? If not, why is farmed meat fine but personally trapped disgusting? Think about it.’

She then posted the image of her pet cat  in front of a bowl of the rabbit’s innards,  adding: ‘No waste no packaging no processing no food miles.’

A picture of the cat devouring the entrails followed, captioned: ‘For all the Tweeters who said my cat would prefer Whiskers [sic] (where do u think pet food comes from BTW?)’

Twitter user HollyHox replied: ‘Thing is  that most people don’t feel a need to post such a graphic image and joke about it.  That’s the difference.’

Arthur Japin said: ‘How your cat and you have disappointed me. At least the cat has  an excuse.’

However, some users defended Miss Winterson’s tweets – with a few of them even asking for tips.

Jeanette Winterson, the author of Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, also used the social media site the tell her 32,700 followers that the offed bunny would make a 'great glove puppet'

Hazel James wrote: ‘Isn’t that the balance of nature? At least it’s fresh, not like the frozen tasteless ones butchers sell.’

Annie-Marie Speed posted: ‘Delicious 
and very eco friendly’, while Keith Morton asked: ‘Which wine did you 
have with it? Looks lovely.’  Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, published 
in 1985, is based on

Miss Winterson’s own upbringing and 
tells the story of a young lesbian girl growing up in Accrington, 
Lancashire. In 1990 it was made into a BBC TV series starring Geraldine 
McEwan and Celia Imrie.

She has told of how her adoptive parents ran a self-reliant household where it was normal to keep hens and rabbits for the pot.

In an article in 2005, she wrote: ‘We
 had what Mrs Winterson called “butcher’s meat” only on Sundays,’ she 
wrote. ‘Mid-week, it was either our own chicken or our own rabbit, and 
plenty of veg.’

Bemoaning the advent of large 
supermarkets in the Seventies, with cheap, shrink-wrapped produce, she 
added: ‘I find it odd though, that my family, who had no car, no phone, 
no inside loo, no bank account, no credit cards, slot meters for 
electricity and gas, and one winter coat, ate far better than today’s so
 called working classes. We were not fat but we were fed.’ 

Winterson also uploaded pictures of her cooking rabbit meat 'in cider with rosemary and thyme', and a picture of her cat eating the rabbit's innards

Miss Winterson has also previously 
hinted at the voracious appetite of the local rabbits at her Cotswold 
home, describing how its acre of vegetable garden was big enough to 
‘more or less feed yourself and rabbits’ friends and relations forever’.

Among other wildlife to have died at 
her hands are crayfish, which she has written of catching from the river
 at the bottom of the garden and serving with mayonnaise made from her 
hens’ eggs.

She moved to the country in the 
Nineties to follow her passion for fresh, local produce but later bought
 a terraced house in Spitalfields, East London, where she opened an 
organic food shop.

Miss Winterson used Twitter to 
propose to her partner, psychoanalyst Susie Orbach, on Valentine’s Day 
in 2009 – but last year revealed that she was still trying to get Miss 
Orbach to say yes.

Miss Winterson’s agents last night said she was on holiday  and unable to comment on the Twitter exchanges.
