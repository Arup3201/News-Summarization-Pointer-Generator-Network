When an American parenting blogger took a photo of her five-month-old baby seemingly peering out of a giant mug, an adorable new internet sensation was born.

Dubbed 'baby mugging', mothers across the U.S. were quick to jump on the trend by uploading their own snaps.

And now, the cute photo trend, which has swept Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, has landed in the UK.

Breakfast brew: These tots lay out whilst their parents snap them in, what looks like, giant tea mugs

The BabyCentre Community has been experimenting with the latest baby photo trend to a delightful effect.

On Baby.co.uk, they write: 'No, baby mugging doesn’t mean stealing your baby’s dummy or favourite toy.

'The baby mugging craze involves 
pretending your baby is sat in a mug, and then taking a photo of it.

'It 
sounds strange, but the results are adorable.'

To create the shot mothers have held a mug above their tots as they lay on the floor or bed so that only their face can be seen bobbing above the rim.

Some also photographed their children upside down, to make it seem as if they are plunging headfirst into the mug. Some feature family pets too.

Along with ceramic slogan mugs, creative parents have also used china teacups and even pint glasses.

Peekaboo! The baby mugging trend has swept social media and parenting blogs in the UK

Themed mugs: Some of the mugs have slogans and funny tag lines

It's a hard life: A lot of the babies are blissfully unaware of their parent's antics

Some
of the drinking vessels are printed with messages such as 'Keep Calm and Carry On' and 'I love you'.

The youngsters' facial expressions, which include smiles, winks and frowns, also provide a source of entertainment and some are seen with their arms and legs enthusiastically waving in the air.

The site also gives tips for parents who want to join the trend. They write: 'Want to mug your baby? Follow these simple instructions...

'Choose a flat surface, like the floor or your bed. If you want the background of your photo to be uniform, cover it with a blanket then lie your baby on top.

'Hold your favorite mug up so it appears as if your baby is inside – and shoot!'
