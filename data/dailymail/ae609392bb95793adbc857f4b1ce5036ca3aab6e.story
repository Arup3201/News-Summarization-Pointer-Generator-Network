More than 60 people were arrested and 83 others were hurt when a New Year's Eve festival in New Zealand erupted into a riot. 

Police had a running battle with drunks for three hours, during which full bottles, cans and camping gear were used as projectiles at the Gisborne New Year's Eve festival.

The brawl broke out in the festival camp grounds late in the afternoon at the beach-side festival, during which cars were flipped over and fires lit.

Mikayla Stuart, was working at a food stall inside the festival grounds and told Stuff.co.nz 'I'm not too sure whether it was pre-planned or not but a lot of campers got on board with it very quickly.

'There were cans of alcohol flying through the air as well as chairs tent poles hitting heaps of people ... another worker and I were curious and went to have a closer look and it turned into absolute chaos.'

Images from the camp ground show worried party-goers cowering behind mattresses as projectiles rained down across the camp sites.

This is not the first time there has been a problem with the crowds and the local police commander, Inspector Sam Aberahama, also told the website that the riot was a planned event and co-ordinated ahead of time by trouble-makers.

NZ authorities are now investigating the rules around the event, which attracted more than 7000 people and allowed unlimited alcohol into the camps. It was a decision local police had unsuccessfully challenged ahead of the day.

'This was an intentional riot that was fuelled by alcohol. It was obvious a plan had been put in place by the main agitators, which quickly spread through the campgrounds. We used every available police resource to try to keep control of the crowds, he told Stuff.co.nz.

83 people required treatment from ambulance officers for a range of injuries, seven were taken to hospital.

The problem started when people inside nearby camp grounds began trading insults at a fence line, pushing it over to begin the brawl. The fight quickly spread.

In the end, 63 trouble-makers were arrested at the scene and face charges ranging from disorderly behaviour to assault.
