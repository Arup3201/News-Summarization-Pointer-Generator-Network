In a galaxy far, far away it may be normal for a gold android to be spotted fishing from a blustery seaside promenade. But not in Kent.

Nevertheless the Star Wars character C3PO was photographed rod in hand by Bo and Maggie Beolens while the couple were bird-watching near Herne Bay.

In a galaxy...just down the M20: C3PO was spotted fishing alone in blustery wind and fog in Kent

The golden character, played by Anthony Daniels in the hit film series, is usually seen with R2D2

The well-known birdwatcher had driven to Reculver, a birding hotspot, when he discovered the droid.

Mr
 Beolens, 64, from Margate, said: 'Iâ€™m a keen bird watcher and I had 
driven to Reculver to have a look for wildlife nesting among the Roman 
ruins there.

'I pulled up into the car park and was just sat in my car when I saw a glimmer of gold along the seafront.

'I am a fan of Star Wars so I instantly recognised it to be C3PO stood there with a fishing rod in one hand.

'My wife Maggie and I were just sat there with our mouths open - it was such a strange sight.

'Luckily I had a camera with me so I took a few photos.

'I have no explanation as to what he was doing there - maybe he was fishing for oil cans?

'It was really misty and so we didnâ€™t see many birds but seeing C3PO fishing instead made our morning.'

C3PO was played by British actor Anthony Daniels in all six Star Wars films, which began with Episode 4: A New Hope in 1977.

Daniels and Kenny Baker, who played R2D2, are the only two actors to appear in each film.

C3POâ€™s
 design is based largely on the Maschinenmensch played by Brigitte Helm 
in 1927 film Metropolis, the first ever feature-length sci-fi movie.

The peculiar stunt follows sightings of clowns in Lancashire and Northampton - prompting worried residents to call the police.

In 2010, 'horse boy' was spotted on Google Maps, then subsequently seen all over Aberdeen in Scotland

Spooky: Residents in Burnley alerted police when this clown (left) was spotted in November. It was two months after the Northampton clown (right) spooked people around the town - before a student admitted it was him

In September, after weeks of confusion and 999 calls, Northampton University student Alex Powell admitted to dressing up as the eerie figure and parading the town.

The Lancashire clown spotted last month is yet to be identified.

And in 2010, a 'horse-boy' was spotted on Google Maps in Aberdeen - before pictures emerged of him all around the city.
