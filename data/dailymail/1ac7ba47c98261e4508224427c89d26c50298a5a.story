A former police motorcyclist who said riding powerful bikes as part of his job damaged his hearing has won a £6,500 payout.

Peter Hall, 56, from Stockport, suffered deteriorated hearing and developed tinnitus, or constant ringing in his ears, as a result of his work with the British Transport Police (BTP)  motorbike unit in Manchester.

Mr Hall's job called for him to ride fast 650cc and 1100cc motorbikes for the team for more than a decade, responding to emergency calls on the rail network throughout Greater Manchester.

Former police motorcyclist Peter Hall, 56, won compensation after saying the loud bikes damaged his hearing

Mr Hall owns a Honda Pan-European 1300 bike but says it doesn't have sirens and he doesn't ride it as fast

After retiring, he noticed he had hearing loss and tinnitus, and hospital tests confirmed that the father-of-three's hearing had suffered because of his work on noisy motorbikes with sirens.

Mr Hall said he decided to take action after he spoke to a motorcycle officer from another force and realised BTP had done ‘nothing’ to help protect his hearing.

The force settled the case without going to court and paid him £6,500 compensation.

Mr Hall said: 'All they had to do was provide us with regular hearing tests and the proper equipment, [but] they didn’t do anything.

'The health and safety laws are in place to protect people at work but BTP was not interested. Their attitude was: "Just get the job done, we don’t care how, just do it".

He added: 'In the last few years of service, they tossed us a pair of ear plugs but they were pointless because you couldn’t hear the police radio while wearing them. We needed proper protection and to have our time on the bikes limited.

'My hearing has been damaged and they could have done something about it for ten years.'

He said he struggles to hear people speak when in group situations, and has constant ringing in his ears, often when he gets home to a quiet house after being out.

Mr Hall joined BTP in 1981 and transferred to the Manchester motorcycle unit, based at the city's Piccadilly Station, in 1999.

He had to leave the force in 2011, with a total of 30 years' service, after he was badly injured on duty when a 4x4 ran into the back of him at traffic lights in Levenshulme.

A keen motorcyclist at home, he rides his own Honda Pan-European 1300 bike, but said this was taken into account by lawyers.

Mr Hall said his fight with BTP had nothing to do with money - he was motivated by his principles

And he said: 'The difference is, I don't ride my bike at those sorts of speeds, and it doesn't have sirens.'

Mr Hall, who now works for a car dealership, said he brought the case as 'a matter of principle', and was not concerned about money.

He said: 'BTP needed to be brought to task. Somewhere, somebody should be held to account.'

His solicitor Christopher Briggs said: 'I am pleased his hearing loss has been recognised as work-related and that he has some compensation.'

A spokesperson for British Transport Police (BTP) saiD: 'Following a civil claim by former officer Peter Hall, BTP agreed to pay Mr Hall the sum of £6,500 compensation.

'This was a result of informal negotiations between Mr Hall’s legal team and BTP, the force has never made a formal acceptance of liability for Mr Hall’s hearing damage.

'The health and safety of our officers and staff is paramount to BTP, and as such we always look to review cases of this nature in order to continually improve our systems and processes.'

Tinnitus is a term that describes any sound a person can hear from inside their body.

It is often described as a ringing in the ears but the sounds that can be heard include buzzing, humming, grinding and hissing.

Sometimes the sound beats in time with the person's pulse.

The condition can cause sleeping problems and depression but, in itself, it is not harmful.

There is no underlying cure for tinnitus, which mostly affects people over 65 (file picture)

The underlying cause is not known but it can be caused by earwax, an ear infection, stress, a head injury or exposure to loud noise.

There is no single cure for tinnitus but sometimes it can be addressed by treating the underlying cause - for example, through removing earwax build-ups.

Tinnitus is often worse in quiet environments so some people benefit from listening to soothing sounds, such as the sound of the ocean.

The condition is most common in people over the age of 65 but it can affect people of all ages.

About ten per cent of the population are thought to have the condition, though most have it mildly.
