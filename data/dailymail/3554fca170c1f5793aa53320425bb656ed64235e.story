Internet blogger Charles Trippy went the extra mile to impress fans by filming himself undergoing brain surgery.

Charles, who lives in Tampa, Florida with his wife Ali, produced his latest video while surgeons removed a tumour on his brain on Tuesday.

The 29-year-old remained awake but heavily sedated throughout the operation at a Boston hospital, and at one point even handed his camera to the surgeon so he could be filmed lying on the operating table.

As the camera is turned on him, he is seen giving a 'thumbs-up' signal, but refuses to make Ozzy Devil Horns, saying: 'I'll keep the devil out of here.'

Speaking to his wife, Charles even manages to keep his sense of humour, saying: 'Hi honey - I love you. Everything's going great.

'My brain is open and you can see the TV remote isn't there like we thought.'

The operation takes several hours to complete.

The video diary charts his progress from his arrival at the hospital to a post-operation interview with Ali, who tells him he was hilarious even when he was sedated.

When he asks her if it is still attached, Ali says: 'Is what attached?'

'My head,' replies Charles.

But while Mr Trippy's achievement is impressive, he is not the first patient to have remained conscious during brain surgery.

Earlier this year another patient in the US played guitar while having an operation to control his Parkinson's disease.

The latest entry fro the couple's Video Killed TV vlog has already been watched more than 250,000 times.

Since launching their vlog, they have made 1,601 short films and hold the Guinness World Record for the consecutive number of days they have been uploaded to YouTube.

Their entries are said to have been watched more than 403,700,000 times.
