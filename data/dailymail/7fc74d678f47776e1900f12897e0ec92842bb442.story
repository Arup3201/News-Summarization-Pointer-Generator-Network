Upminster Park Rovers Under 8s defeated their Spanish counterparts in the Barcelona Football Festival final after winning all three of their group games and a semi-final along the way.

The British team triumphed 2-1 in Spain to ensure they go home with the silverware.

West Ham are certainly looking to the future as Sam Allardyce's side have reportedly snapped up six of the eight players from the winning team.Â 

Rovers Manager Steve McMahon told SWNS.com: 'The final was a really tough match, but then again we were a Sunday League team playing against a squad from one of the biggest clubs in the world.

'Our boys managed to score two goals quite quickly, and then held on until the end of the match.

'I'm so proud of my team. They performed throughout with exemplary discipline, much better than players twice their age.
