Hope Solo's 17-year-old nephew says she repeatedly punched him and hit his mother with a broomstick after getting into an argument at his home Saturday night - and he has the pictures to prove it.

The unnamed nephew told investigators that the altercation became so heated, he had to retrieve a gun to defend himself from his enraged relative.

These revelations surfaced Monday, as Solo made her first appearance in court and plead not guilty to charges of domestic violence.

According to documents obtained by TMZ, Solo came over to the 17-year-old's house on Saturday night, angry after having missed a flight.

Rage: Solo's nephew told cops that she came over to the house drunk and angry after missing a flight. She went on to berate her nephew and call him fat and a p****, he claims

The two started talking and Solo became even ore infuriated when she believed he was offending her.

Solo went on to tell her nephew that he would never be a pro athlete because he was 'too fat and crazy'.

The nephew went into another room where Solo continued to berate him, calling him a 'p****' when he called his mom.

'I then told her to get her c*** face out of my house' the boy told police.

That's when Solo got offensive and stared punching her nephew and grabbing his hair.

When the boy's mother intervened, Solo lashed out at her as well, beating her over the head with a broomstick.

Solo finally let up and left he house when the nephew called police.

After entering her not guilty plea in 
court on Monday, Solo was released without bail and ordered not to have 
contact with the alleged victims and to not drink alcohol.

Authorities
 say Solo was intoxicated during the assault, but her lawyer Todd 
Maybrown insists she was actually a victim in the altercation.

'Hope
 is not guilty of any crime,' Maybrown said in an email sent on 
Saturday. 'In face out investigation reveals that Hope was assaulted and
 injured during this unfortunate incident. We look forward to the 
opportunity to present the true facts in court and to having this matter
 behind Hope very soon.'

Solo was arrested at her sister's house just before 1am Saturday morning, after police were called to the Kirkland residence where a woman was hitting people and refusing to stop or leave.

According to a police report obtained by The Seattle Times, a male caller told 911 the 32-year-old was 'hitting people' at a family gathering.

'Officer arrived and immediately heard the sounds of the disturbance inside the residence,' the report noted.

'They entered and contacted several persons; one being Hope A Stevens (Solo) who appeared intoxicated and upset.'

Authorities said Solo's 17-year-old nephew and her sister had visible injuries.

'After receiving statements of the persons involved, Officers determined that Solo was the primary aggressor and had instigated the assault,' the report said.

Kirkland police Lt. Mike Murray said there was 'a big party going on at her house'.

'It was an out-of-control situation' Lt. Murray told The Times.

Solo was booked into jail for investigation of two counts of fourth-degree domestic violence assault. Her next court appearance is scheduled for August 11.

The sister was not identified by police, but in her memoir, Solo writes that she has a half sister named Terry.

Solo's late father, Jeffrey Solo, had two children, Terry and David, before divorcing his wife.He then remarried and had Hope and her brother, Marcus.

Solo has won two Olympic gold medals for the US women's national team. She also plays with the Seattle Reign of the National Women's Soccer League.

'We are aware of the situation with Hope and are now gathering information,' the Reign posted on the team's Twitter feed.

In 2012, she married former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens.

This isn't the first altercation Solo has had with police. Reports show police were called to a disturbance at her Kirkland home in the early hours on November 12, 2012, with her then-boyfriend Jerramy Stevens (pictured with Solo in 2013) arrested pending domestic violence charges. Stevens was released and the couple were married the following day

He was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving her, but he was not charged. Maybrown represented Stevens in that case.

Solo said soon afterward that there never was an assault and that she and her new husband were happy.

'It's unfortunate what the media can do to judge before the facts are out there. It's hard to see, but it's a hard truth, and it's part of life,' she said then. 'I'm happy. I'm happily married. I would never stand for domestic violence. I've never been hit in my life.'

In her last appearance for the US, Solo recorded her 71st career shutout, a 1-0 victory over France on June 14 in Tampa, Florida. She sat out the team's game against France on Thursday night in Connecticut.
