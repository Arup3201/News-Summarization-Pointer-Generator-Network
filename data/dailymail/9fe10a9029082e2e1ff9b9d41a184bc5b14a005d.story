An SAS sniper is facing jail after being found guilty of stashing an Iraqi pistol and more than 300 live rounds in his bedroom.

Sergeant Danny Nightingale, 38, could now be sentenced to five years in military detention.

He was originally ordered to serve 18 months in military detention after pleading guilty in November 2012.

But this was overturned on appeal on the basis that he had been placed under ‘improper pressure’ to plead guilty. Yesterday the elite soldier said he felt ‘great shock’ at the court martial’s new verdict.

Police found the arsenal at the home he shared with an SAS comrade – identified only as Soldier N – after a tip-off.

Sgt Nightingale, a veteran of 18 years, told detectives he was given the Glock as a war trophy by Iraqi troops he trained in the warzone in 2007.

He said the ammunition was left over from his job as a range instructor.

But at his six-day trial the soldier changed his story, insisting he had made a ‘false confession’.

The married father-of-two blamed his confusion on memory loss caused by a brain injury suffered when he collapsed during a charity run in the Brazilian jungle in 2009.

He said he had no recollection of receiving the weapon and explained he filled in gaps in his memory with stories other people had told him – a medical condition known as ‘confabulation’.

Sgt Nightingale had said he had no knowledge of the Glock and ammunition being in his bedroom and said they were put there by someone else

He argued that Soldier N, serving two years in prison after admitting possessing another Glock, brought both pistols back from Iraq and planted one in his bedroom to avoid a tougher sentence.

But yesterday at Bulford Military Court, Wiltshire, the board rejected his story and found him guilty, concluding he had put the public at risk by storing the cache in his rented house in Hereford.

Sgt Nightingale showed no emotion as the verdict was read out but his wife Sally struggled to fight back tears.  Sentencing was adjourned pending a Court of Appeal hearing on length of punishment.

Sgt Nightingale now says the confession he made to the police was false because of memory problems caused by a brain injury he suffered during a charity endurance marathon in October 2009, which left him in a coma

Speaking outside court, Sgt Nightingale said he would consider appealing, but added: ‘We’re close to financial ruin. Realistically, we have to look at whether we can keep going.’

His wife said: ‘He isn’t guilty and he is not a criminal. We know the truth, and we know most of the public know the truth. Unfortunately we have not got the result we should have.’

He won the right to a retrial earlier this year after having his detention reduced to a suspended sentence of 12 months following a campaign led by his wife and supported by the Mail.

Sgt Nightingale will be medically discharged from the Army in February.
