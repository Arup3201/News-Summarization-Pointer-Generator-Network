German car manufacturer has sparked criticism with its new estate car that, with a top speed of 189mph, is as fast as a Ferrari.

With its huge amount of boot space and plush interior, the new Audi RS6 Avant estate car looks best suited for a family getaway.

But if the kids drive you round the bend, its 4-litre V8 engine means you can make a quick getaway of your own in what is believed to be the world's fastest estate car.

The four-wheel drive 'supercar' can accelerate from 0-62mph in just 3.9 seconds.

By comparison, a Ferrari California gets to 62mph in 3.8 seconds and a Porsche 911 takes 4.1 seconds.

It is the latest model from Audi which has made a series of superfast estate cars.

But road safety charity Brake criticised the company saying there is no need for a family car to be able to drive so fast.

Spokesperson Clare Morrison said: 'There is never a need for a family car to
be able to reach speeds of 190mph, or even 100mph.

'While fast cars can 
be enticing, going fast should only ever be encouraged on race tracks.

'Speed is a factor in all road deaths and injury, as the faster you go, 
the harder you hit.

'Driving above speed limits, or too fast for 
conditions, is plain dangerous and causes many deaths and catastrophic 
injuries on roads every year.

'That’s why Brake urges all drivers to 
drive under speed limits at all times, and go even slower when 
conditions call for it such as outside schools and homes or in bad 
weather; to do otherwise is inviting disaster.'

A spokesperson for Audi said: 'There are numerous cars capable of exceeding UK national speed limits but all German cars are designed to cope with the de-restricted sections of Autobahn.

'Many of our customers appreciate the safety and stability designed into these cars which are, in effect, over-engineered for British Roads.

'Four-wheel-drive and other advanced items like large brakes make cars like the RS6 safer than smaller less powerful cars at UK speeds and this adds to the appeal of our more highly engineered models'.

Brute force: The Audi has a 4 litre V8 engine which is also used by the Bentley Continental

Roomy: The RS6 still has space for five passengers and luggage in the boot despite the 4 litre V8 engine

The V8 engine is also used in the 
Bentley Continental - popular with Premier League footballers - and 
powers an eight-speed gearbox.

The standard model will be limited to 155mph but this can be removed to give it a top speed of 174mph.

  0-60mph    :  3.9 seconds

 Top Speed : 189mph

 Engine       : 4-litre V8

 Efficiency  :  28mpg

 Cost           :  Between £75,000 to £80,000

But owners wanting to go even faster can opt for the top-end ‘Dynamic Plus’ model which will hit a staggering 189mph.

Audi's team of engineers performed 5,000 test miles at the Nurburgring race track 
before signing it off for production.

And despite its performance, Audi
claims the RS6 Avant is capable of 28mpg which makes it 40 per cent 
more efficient than its predecessor.

It is expected to cost between £75,000 to £80,000 when it goes on sale next year.

The firm, based in Ingolstadt, 
Germany, had its best year in 2011 - selling 1.3 million cars worldwide 
with 113,703 models sold in the UK.
