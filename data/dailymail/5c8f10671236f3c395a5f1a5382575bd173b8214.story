Phil Neville played 59 times for England and had his share of good days and bad. He was often a target for disgruntled fans who had to pin their disappointment on somebody.

On Saturday he took a belly-load of flak without even putting his boots on. On BBC TV’s big World Cup catch, England’s opener against Italy, he provided co-commentary alongside Guy Mowbray.

Phil Neville is a decent bloke with a lifelong grasp of the game but late on Saturday night into Sunday morning, his interpretation of the action in front of him was simply too low-key and flat.

Flat: Phil Neville was cast in an unfamiliar co-commentary role for England vs Italy and struggled, unlike his brother Gary (right) when he does the same job on Sky Sports

His brother, Gary, who won 85 caps, 
was busy on the touchline on England duty but in his day job at Sky 
Sports has blossomed from the sheer volume of opportunities that working
 for them offers new recruits from football. Hours on the clock, so to 
speak.

Phil knows his stuff 
and is a passionate Englishman but he was cast in a difficult and 
unfamiliar role by his BBC bosses. He sounded more like he was in the 
examination room for one of his coaching badges, not ‘ringside’ as two 
European football heavyweights slugged it out toe-to-toe in the heat of 
the Brazilian rainforest.

Indeed,
 his voice at times was so quiet he might as well have been auditioning 
for one of BBC’s latest high-cost costume dramas. ‘It’s after midnight 
here — for God’s sake speak up’, the nation was shouting at the telly.

In television sport, a huge amount of time and money is spent making sure the ‘showroom’, the TV studio, looks world-class and is filled with stellar names. They are the in-vision personalities and make the headlines. However, the commentary box is the real engine-room of any outside-broadcast.

Just do the sums yourself. As viewers we spend more actual time in the company of the commentators than their studio-based colleagues.

Sure, the opening titles, music, studio presentation, look, feel and contents give the output its distinctive style and tone, but I still think the hard yards are done in the commentary box. It is instinctive live broadcasting.

Good team: Neville is part of a BBC line-up that has many impressive pundits and analysts

When the archive is raided for a memory it is the action and the voice that accompanies it that is on our screens, not how it was analysed later. A lot of attention and help is given to the studio guests, an aid not always replicated to those ‘on the road’.

Viewing figures for England’s defeat were huge. The peak audience was 15.4million. 11.5m average, with over 12m still watching well after midnight. Fittingly, given the conditions in Manaus, BBC2 ran 1980s movie Body Heat, a steamy affair of an altogether  different nature, alongside it.

ITV pick up the baton with England’s final two group games and will score heavily. Thursday evening’s crunch match with Uruguay has a peak-time 8pm kick-off and ITV bosses hope the match reaches 20m viewers at its peak.

Laughing it off: Neville went on Twitter on Sunday to answer his critics

Elsewhere, I’ve enjoyed the Brazilian players singing their anthem with such unrestrained emotion, the Colombian goal celebrations, the free-kick ‘foam’, crowd shots of fans having a great time, Gabby Logan’s England reporting, Danny Murphy’s touchline thoughts, Fabio Cannavaro and Rio Ferdinand in their respective studios and BBC’s Tim Vickery, for his deep knowledge of South American football and their way of life.

But I’ve already had enough of the Goal Line Technology caption. Just use it when you need to please.
