They're showered with gifts wherever they go but not all the items presented to the Royal Family are quite what most would imagine.

Among the more unusual items  lavished on the royals, which were revealed in a list released by Buckingham Palace, were tins of tuna, model missiles and a supermarket's worth of mangoes.

Many of the mangoes were presented to Prince Andrew, who is famously fond of the fruit, although Princess Anne was also given a box of 100 by the president of Pakistan, Mamnoon Hussain.

Global giving: The Royal Family has received items from all over the world, some unusual

Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall received the largest number of gifts, amassing 176 over the course of the year, followed by the Earl and Countess of Wessex who were given 136.

The Queen was presented with 102 different items, Princess Anne got 135 presents and Prince Andrew was gifted with 107.

Prince Philip got the fewest gifts and was presented with just 19, among them a gold brooch and silver spoon from the Lord Mayor of London and joint present of a case of beer from the Cotleigh Brewery and Go Commando charity.

Many of the more unusual gifts were picked up during overseas tours, with the Duke of York being presented with a model of a dhow boat during his visit to Kuwait in May and a miniature Volkswagen Beetle in Germany in June.

During their tour of Mexico and Colombia at the end of October, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall were presented with a total of 43 gifts, among them a pair of maracas, a poncho and a packet of dried beef.

The Earl and Countess of Wessex were the recipients of some of the most eccentric gifts, with the couple handed a jar of passion fruit jam by a well-wisher in Barbados last January and several tins of canned fish during a trip to Brandt Louie in Canada in December.

Also given to the Wessexes was a biography of Usain Bolt which was presented to them by the Jamaican sprinter himself, and a stone which was given to them by a well-wisher during a visit to the Clearwell Caves in Gloucestershire.

Some of the most impressive gifts were presented to the Queen, including a 15-piece set of Sèvres porcelain handed to the monarch by President François Hollande of France during her visit to the country in June.

The French premier also presented the Queen with a set of Hermès photo albums containing pictures of Her Majesty during previous visits to France, a white porcelain sculpture of a horse and a copy of the French edition of the London News dating from 1843 and featuring Queen Victoria.

More unusual items included a model of the infamous Iron Throne of Game of Thrones fame, a book about the Eurotunnel and a silver box containing soil from World War I battlefields.

Many of the gifts presented to the Queen came from ambassadors and were given as the diplomats presented Her Majesty with their credentials.

Such gifts include a Bumbung Perak Pahat Tumbuk jewellery case presented by Major General Dato Paduka Seri Haji Ami of Brunei Darussalam, a silver tray from Cambodia's Meas Kim Heng and a sculpture of a Bengal tiger from High Commissioner Mohamed Mijarul Quayes of Bangladesh.

Tempting though keeping some of the gifts might be, Buckingham Palace is at pains to point out that none of the royals are allowed to keep the presents for themselves.

'Official gifts are not the private property of the member of the Royal Family who receives them but are instead received in an official capacity in the course of official duties,' explains a palace source. 

'Perishables such as food may be personally used or consumed, while other gifts may be used or displayed  in royal residences and on royal estates or become part of the Royal Collection.'

All official gifts presented to the Queen automatically become part of the Royal Collection and are either displayed in the royal palaces themselves or are loaned out to museums and galleries. 

Some gifts, however, have had to find more permanent homes, among them the animals presented to the Queen over the course of her reign.

These include several horses, among them Burmese who was presented to the Queen by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and ridden by Her Majesty at the Trooping the Colour from 1969 to 1986. 

More exotic animals are given to London Zoo, among them jaguars and sloths from Brazil, two black beavers from Canada  and a seven-year-old bull elephant called Jumbo which arrived in the UK from Cameroon in 1972.
