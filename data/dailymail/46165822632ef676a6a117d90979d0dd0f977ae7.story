A young woman from Romania who had a death fetish and managed to con a doctor into believing she was a medical student so she could do an autopsy on a dead body has ended up with a cult following of her own.

Mihaela Zagrean, 23, hit the headlines when she was photographed with her hands inside the body of the dead man in a morgue in the city of Petrosani in south-western Romania. The incident  resulted in her being sued by the family of the man whose corpse they accused her of defiling.

But while the incident would sicken most, Mihaela developed a cult following, with a legion of men willing to pay to chat with her online. And she's now married a wealthy admirer, who's paid for the Romanian's full-body transformation.

She earned the nickname The Corpse Ripper by local 
media and, capitalising on her new-found fame, she moved to the capital Bucharest where she completely transformed 
her image and started chatting online with admirers.

She changed her hair colour from blonde to dark brown, lost weight and got silicon implants.

She also resorted to Botox and other surgical tricks, completing the process with tattoos and piercings.

After
 landing herself a wealthy lover, Mihaela, has now snapped up a rare 
Spyhnx cat, named after the ancient Egyptian Sphynx that legend says was
 the guardian to the realm of the dead.

Reinventing herself proved extremely lucrative for the young woman who ended up with a huge number of fans

She has even changed her name now calling herself Michelle.

Reinventing
 herself proved extremely lucrative for the young woman who ended 
up with a huge admirer of fans who paid a fortune to chat with her
 online.

She
 eventually married one and now has two children of her own, boasting 
that her husband loves her so much he is prepared to give her everything
 she wants.

That included the rare Sphynx cat which cost more than Â£1,000 and gets to share her bed at night.

The
 Sphynx cat is named after the ancient Great Sphinx of Giza but actually
 was first seen in 1975 when a cat in the U.S. gave birth to a hairless 
kitten that was sold to a local breeder who revived the Sphynx breed by 
expanding and strengthening the gene pool.
