For someone comfortable to let the spotlight shine on others, James Milner is probably in two minds about being regarded as the new must-have accessory for all the Premier League's top clubs.

But he can't avoid the truth any longer. Having just celebrated his 29th birthday with two FA Cup goals against Sheffield Wednesday at the weekend, Milner's stock has never been higher. He is one of the stars of the season.

Manchester City, with all their injury problems and squad restrictions, couldn't have done without him this season. Rivals like Arsenal and Liverpool covet him. And as his contract at the Etihad runs into the final six months, Milner's bargaining position has never been stronger.

Milner has been called many things in his career since scoring his first Premier League goal for Leeds United at 16.

He's versatile, having played at full back, holding midfield, right wing, left wing, No 10 and now striker following injuries to Sergio Aguero, Stevan Jovetic and Edin Dzeko. Once seen as a weakness - 'Jack of all trades, master of none' - it is now a strength.

He's also been mocked for being 'boring', even poking fun at himself for his image. All because he is teetotal and prefers to play golf rather than be photographed in celebrity hang-outs on his days off.

Milner has attracted interest from Liverpool with his contract running out at the end of the season

Here's the breakdown of James Milner's host of positions playing for Manchester City in 27 appearances in all competitions this season:

Midfield (right) - 5

Midfield (left) - 5

Forward/striker - 4

Attacking midfield (left) - 2

Midfield (centre) - 1

Substitute appearances - 10 

But if these are flaws, Arsene Wenger and Brendan Rodgers are two of countless managers prepared to accept them.

They would prefer their players to be boring rather than getting into controversy through boozing, smoking or problematic exchanges on social media.

They also know in an era where clubs are restricted to 25 players in their Premier League squad (and 21 for City in the Champions League this season due to FPP penalties) Milner is even more valuable because he is five players in one.

Milner is in an incredibly strong position as he prepares to enter his 30s.

Manchester City have recently played Milner as a striker, seen here against Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday

He has shown before at Leeds United, Newcastle United and Aston Villa that he is strong enough to end up with what he wants and while very happy in the environment at City, he will seek assurances from Pellegrini about the amount of matches he will play next season before committing himself to a new deal.

Milner has helped out his manager this season when others have been unable to play but the memory of being left out of last season's Capital One Cup final at Wembley runs deep.

Having spent £25million on Adam Lallana last summer, the prospect of landing Milner for nothing will be mouthwatering for Liverpool boss Rodgers and the club's moneyball owners. After Luis Suarez and Mario Balotelli, he would be easy for the club's overworked PR department too.

Manchester City remain confident that Milner, scoring against Sheffield Wednesday, will sign a new deal

Arsene Wenger would see Milner as a positive influence on his young English players Danny Welbeck, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers and others. On the pitch, he would give 100 per cent effort, has match intelligence and knows how to distribute the ball to keep attacking momentum.

Even Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford will be wondering if politically he can sign a former Manchester City player. United have also had severe injury problems this season and Milner is the type you want in the squad when that happens.

The problem will be persuading City to let their asset leave early. Their £30m pursuit of Wilfried Bony does mean sacrifices will have to be made elsewhere in their squad to fit in with FPP restrictions.

Getting £5m now for Milner would be one option but it's hard to think that would make sense from Pellegrini's point of view given the player's form and importance to the dressing room.

He is also one of the five association-trained players City need to fill their quota in their Champions League squad and you know the boss would rather have Milner there than Scott Sinclair, for example.

When Aguero (knee) and Edin Dzeko (calf) left City bereft of a centre-forward at the start of  December, there were plenty of doom-and-gloom merchants who thought their challenge was over at home and abroad.

Instead, Pellegrini asked Milner to play up front, and the way he created space for the likes of David Silva and Samir Nasri meant the good results continued.

City are now unbeaten in 12 games, joint top of the Premier League and have Barcelona next up in Europe. Life is anything but dull and for those clubs who want Milner, they face a wait of at least six months.
