The owner of a women's gun shop has died following a shootout during which he and his  wife took down three of the four armed robbers who burst into their Kansas-based store, police have said.

John Bieker, 44, and his wife, Rebecca, reportedly got into a gunfight with the men after they attempted to rob She's a Pistol in Shawnee, suburban Kansas City, at around 2.15pm on Friday.

They shot three of the suspects - two of whom remain in a critical condition - but Mr Bieker was  hit in return fire. He was rushed to hospital in a serious condition, but has since passed away.

When police arrived at the scene, Mrs Bieker was found tending to her wounded husband. Although she wasn't shot in the gunfight herself, she suffered minor injuries after being punched in the face.

In a press release, Shawnee Police said the two suspects who were not critically injured fled the scene on foot, but were located a short time later on the porch of a nearby home.

One of these men was also  shot in the apparent botched robbery at the suburban Kansas City gun store, which also has a shooting range offering self-defense courses geared toward women.

However, his injuries are not considered life-threatening, Johnson County MED-ACT spokesman, Angela Fera, told the Associated Press.

The uninjured suspect is currently being held on suspicion of aggravated robbery, while the hospitalized men are under armed guard, police said.

Authorities do yet know who fired first, nor whether any customers were inside the store at the time. Following the shootout, some private and public schools in the area were placed on lockdown.

In a statement to KSHB, Shawnee Mayor Jeff Meyers said the city was suffering from 'great sadness' in the wake of the attempted robbery and subsequent shootout.

He said: 'Today is a day of great sadness in our city. John and Becky are respected business owners in our community who do things the right way and are always willing to help others.

'There is no place for this type of violence in Shawnee or any other city. We pride ourselves on being a safe and friendly city and today’s events, while unbelievably tragic, will not change that.

'I want to pass along my condolences to the entire Bieker family. As they deal with this tremendous loss, I know our community stands ready to assist in any way that we can.' 

On the store's website, the Biekers describe She's a Pistol as a 'woman-owned personal protection and self-defense training, services, and supplies company'. 

An investigation is ongoing. 

Investigation: 'There is no place for this type of violence in Shawnee or any other city. We pride ourselves on being a safe and friendly city and today’s events, while unbelievably tragic, will not change that,' said Meyers
