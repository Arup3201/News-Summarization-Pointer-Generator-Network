'Disturbing': Kasik is accused of threatening to kill his daughter's volleyball coach and rape members of his family

A father has been accused of threatening to kill a high school volleyball coach and rape members of his family after his daughter was put on the bench during a game.

John J Kasik, 61, allegedly lost his temper when his daughter was taken off the court and replaced by her sister during a volleyball game at her high school in Chicago, U.S.

Furious Kasik is said to have followed the school's athletic director to his home after the game and shouted that he would kill him, before leaving a string of sinister text messages and voicemails for the coach of the team - including one in which he threatened to rape his wife and daughter.

Kasik, of Lisle, Illinois, has been 
charged with telephone harassment, battery and disorderly conduct 
following the 'disturbing' incidents, according to DuPage County State's
Attorney Robert Berlin.

'It's disturbing for a number of reasons,' Mr Berlin told the Chicago Tribune.

'It's a parent obviously not using good judgment.'

Kasik was in the stands to watch his daughter play for her Lisle High School team last Thursday.

Mr
Berlin said that, after reportedly becoming infuriated by the 
substitution, Kasik allegedly followed Lisle High School's athletic 
director Dan Dillard to his home and shouted that he would kill him if 
his distraught daughter 'didn't make it through the night'.

Mr
Dillard convinced the 61-year-old to come into the school the following
day to discuss the matter, but later that same evening Kasik allegedly 
left a stream of threatening text and phone messages for Matt Hrubesky, 
the coach of the volleyball team, the attorney said.

The
following day Kasik met with the athletic director at the school, but 
is alleged to have lost his temper again, blocking the door and 
repeatedly bumping into the official when he tried to leave the room.

Kasik was arrested after the school contacted police.

He is currently out on bond awaiting trial.

'The
school personnel and the coaches need to be protected from things like 
this, so that's why we moved quickly,' Mr Berlin said.
