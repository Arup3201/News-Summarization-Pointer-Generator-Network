After deciding there was something missing from their lives - married couple Melanie and Armando Gomez took a drastic measure.

The financial planners, from California, bought a micro-pig and named her Hamlet - before turning her into an internet sensation.

The pair regularly photograph the miniature pig in outlandish fancy-dress outfits and post the pictures on to Hamlet's personal Instagram account.

Another outfit: The animal also owns this well-fitted unicorn suit 

The adorable pig has now become a celebrity, attracting more than 93,000 followers on the picture sharing website in just a couple of months.

The nine-month old animal can be seen showing off her eclectic wardrobe which includes a dazzling tutu, a Santa's reindeer outfit, a unicorn suit and a body-wrapping burrito.

Despite her diminutive size, Hamlet from Pasadena, California loves to be outside and go on adventures with her loving owners. 

The Gomez's bought Hamlet from a breeder when she was six months old.

They say they were encouraged to set up an Instagram account by their family and friends after the couple started to capture snaps of the fashion savvy pig.

Melanie said: 'Never in a million years did I think Hamlet would be so popular.

'I joined Instagram for fun and to capture her growth as a piglet, I never thought so many people would enjoy her Instagram.

'My husband and I love Hamlet so much, we take her everywhere so her Instagram captures all the little adventures.

'My guess on why it has attracted so many followers is because she is an unusual pet and she's just so darn cute.

'I believe everyone needs a little silly and cute in their daily lives.'
