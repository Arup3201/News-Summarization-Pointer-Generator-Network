Manchester City star Fernandinho has been banned from driving for six months after he was caught speeding twice in three days.

The Brazil international was snapped in his Mercedes doing 50mph in a 30mph zone on Pottery Lane in Ardwick on May 7 last year - the same day City thumped Aston Villa 4-0 on their way to the Premier League title at the nearby Etihad Stadium.

Two days later, on May 9, he triggered another speed camera on Chester Road, close to United’s Old Trafford home, travelling at 40mph in a 30mph area.

The Brazilian midfielder was also fined £580 and ordered to pay £170 costs and a £58 victim surcharge

The 29-year-old, whose full name is Fernando Luiz Roza, accepted the charges through his lawyer at Manchester Magistrates Court.

Magistrates were told that there had been a delay in responding to requests for information from police as the player was at the World Cup in his homeland when they landed on the door of his home in the leafy, footballer-filled Cheshire village of Prestbury.

The footballer, who already had six points on his licence from two other speeding offences, did not attend court.

He was banned for six months, fined £580 and ordered to pay £170 costs and a £58 victim surcharge.

The midfielder is likely to be in Manuel Pellegrini's squad to face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday
