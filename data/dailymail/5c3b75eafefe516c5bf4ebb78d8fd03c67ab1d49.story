It’s a fascinating piece of architecture that is leaving stunned observers wondering how on Earth a bungalow has crash landed on top of a university building.

Do Ho Suh, of Seoul, South Korea, designed ‘Fallen Star’, which was carefully positioned on top of the University of California in San Diego and appears to have been inspired by the Disney film ‘Up’.

The house measures 15ft by 18ft and is an three-quarter version of a small house in Providence, Rhode Island, sticking out of the Jacobs School of Engineering’s seventh floor at a 10-degree angle.

Lifted up: The house was integrated onto a structural concrete slab around 100ft above the ground

‘The engineering on this project has been really complex,’ said Mary Beebe, director of the Stuart Collection, part of UC San Diego. ‘It’s probably the most complex we’ve ever undertaken.’

‘Do Ho Suh’s work explores the notions of home and displacement, the cultural meaning of space and the relationship between the personal and the collective,’ a UC San Diego press release said.

He suggested that ‘Fallen Star’ might represent a house picked up by a tornado and displaced, and the work symbolises a ‘home’ for many students who have left theirs to attend the university.

The house was integrated onto a structural concrete slab. ‘It should be an unforgettable image and experience for all and will invite people to see the world in a new way,’ Ms Beebe added.

Mr Suh studied at Seoul National University before moving to the U.S. in 1991 to attend the Rhode Island School of Design, describing arriving in America as if he was ‘dropped from the sky’.

He also studied at Yale University and now lives and works in New York, London and Seoul, with his works on display in those cities as well as Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Tokyo in Japan.

The house is based on the hit 2009 animated film ‘Up’, which featured 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen going on the trip of his life to see South America by tying thousands of balloons to his home.

The film- - which starred the voices of Edward Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai - won two Oscars and was directed by Pete Docter, who also worked on Monsters Inc and Toy Story 2.
