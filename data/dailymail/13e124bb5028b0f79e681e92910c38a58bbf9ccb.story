Oldham manager Lee Johnson admitted that the Ched Evans saga had been 'unique' but declined to reveal whether he thought the club should have been able to sign the convicted rapist following his side's 2-2 draw with Doncaster Rovers.

The 33-year-old was asked by MailOnline if he believed the deal, which collapsed on Thursday should have gone through.

However, a club press officer interrupted and the interview ended.

Earlier Johnson said the potential move, which Oldham said fell through after threats from sponsors to remove their backing and after threats to staff, was decided on by the club's board.

'It was a very unique potential signing and one that could only have been made at the top end of the board,' he explained.

'There were so many aspects, it divided opinion even among individual families. I have to respect that and make sure I am very careful with what I say to protect everybody.'

Johnson revealed he had tried to turn the issue, which saw the world's media descend on the League One club, into a positive.

'It's been nice to be part of a team under siege,' he said.

'Everyone has stuck together. When you're in the media as much as we have been, it's been different but we've stuck together.

'I think the players and office staff come out with credit after what they have had to deal with. They have been superb.'

During the first half around 20 supporters in the main stand chanted 'There's only one Ched Evans' while a cluster of fans in the home Chaddy End held a banner with the words '70,000 where are you?' in reference to a petition set up against the move for Evans' which attracted more than 70,000 signatures.

Johnson said he had seen the banner but declined to comment on its content.

Loan striker Jabo Ibhere gave Oldham the lead in the 23rd minute with a curling effort from inside the area. The 31-year-old, due to return to Colchester after this match, was teed up by fellow frontman Jonathan Forte who seized on an error from Rovers defender Andy Butler.

Giant centre-half George Elokobi headed in Joseph Mills' corner on minutes on 54 minutes to make it 2-0 for the home side.

On 75 minutes Mills saw red for a two-footed tackle on Doncaster full back Reece Wabara despite referee Carl Boyeson initially missing the offence. Three minutes later Rovers striker Nathan Tyson appeared to bundle over home keeper Paul Rachubka before halving the deficit.

Deep into stoppage time James Coppinger cut in from the right to level the scores and further incense an already-furious home crowd to snatch a barely deserved point for the visitors.
