A controversial website has been set up allowing citizens to rate the performance of cops in the wake of high-profile police brutality cases.

CopScore encourages people to submit 'officer performance reviews' and give star ratings for officers in their area or nationally. 

Anyone can register to the site and the feedback can be anonymous if the user wishes. 

Controversial: CopScore encourages people to submit 'officer performance reviews' and give star ratings for officers in their area or nationally. An example is Officer Grant Morrison from Billings Police Department, Montana, who shot a suspect dead during a traffic stop in April 

The page was shared by its creator on Hacker News, a website designed for start-up technologists, on Thursday. 

According to the site's mission, it aims: 'To help cops do a better job of community policing by providing them with performance reviews directly from community members.'

Critics however are concerned the site will prompt primarily negative reviews from citizens who have had bad experiences with cops, because the search requires a badge number.

One comment read: 'Requiring a valid badge number might encourage only negative posts. I personally haven't demanded a badge number unless I'm displeased.

'I think there may be many instances where someone has something to say and do not know this piece of information.'

Others are concerned it may become full of fake and abusive reviews that could put officers at risk.

Criticism of cops has increased following the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police officers. 

More recently Grant Morrison from Billings Police Department in Montana has garnered national news coverage for shooting a suspect dead during a traffic stop.

He killed 38-year-old Richard Ramirez in April when authorities said Ramirez — a suspect in a recent drug-involved shooting — appeared to reach for something as he sat in his car.

Dashcam footage appeared to show Morrison breaking down in tears and being comforted by officers following the deadly shooting.
