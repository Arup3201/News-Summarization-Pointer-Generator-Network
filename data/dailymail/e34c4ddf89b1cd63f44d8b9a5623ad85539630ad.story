Danny Cipriani has no intention of giving up. He won’t abandon all hope. Playing for England at the World Cup remains the objective, despite recent disappointment.

The Sale fly-half has responded to being omitted from the national squad for the autumn Test campaign in fine style.

Rather than allowing the setback to undermine his form, he has instead played an instrumental role in three successive Aviva Premiership wins which have lifted his club to sixth place in the table.

On Sunday, it was Cipriani’s moment of individual brilliance which created a stunning counter-attack try for the Sharks against Newcastle at Kingston Park. It was another glimpse of his game-breaking class.

After making an impressive contribution on England’s summer tour of New Zealand, the 27-year-old was left out of the latest squad.

But Cipriani said: ‘All I can do is control how I train every day, keep trying to improve and keep working on my point of difference.’

As he prepared for Sale’s European Champions Cup clash with Saracens at the AJ Bell Stadium on Saturday, he added: ‘Even if I don’t get selected, it is a long way to go until the World Cup and I’ll keep driving and keep knocking on the door.

‘I’m going to keep pushing every time I play; with passion and drive and resilience and the will to win. Eventually, I want to play for my country again. ‘Things do happen, things can change and you can play your way into the squad. The England coaches are very good at communicating; they speak to you, tell you what they want and what you have to improve on. It makes you feel like you’re part of the wider squad.’

That match-winning turn at Newcastle was just the latest example of his enhanced contribution at club level. ‘I feel like I’m playing better this year,’ he said. ‘I’m going to keep putting my hand up.’

Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond has regularly championed his playmaker’s Test claims and yesterday said: ‘Danny’s playing really well, he’s controlling the basics and he’s showing on occasion the bit of glitter that he has.

‘There was a great example at Newcastle where two teams were in stalemate with a couple of points in it and his act of brilliance won us the game.

‘It would be foolhardy to think that, if Danny had been selected, England would have beaten South Africa and New Zealand, but I think it would have been wise as a selector to look at him in one of the four games.

‘Danny was outstanding before the squad was announced, against Munster, and didn’t get a look-in.’

Saracens star Owen Farrell stands ahead of Cipriani in the England pecking order

On Saturday, Cipriani is likely to be in direct opposition to Owen Farrell, who has been England’s first-choice No 10 under Stuart Lancaster, only to be demoted last month after a run of poor form.

‘You want to play against the best 10s,’ said Cipriani. ‘In England, you come up against Farrell, Ford, Myler week in, week out. If you get a chance in a European fixture it does add spice to it and you want to have a great game. It’s important that we rise to the occasion as a team.’

Diamond is convinced that if his forwards can front up against an imposing Saracens pack, Cipriani has the ability to trump his opposite number — whether that is Farrell or ex-Shark Charlie Hodgson. ‘If we can get parity then I think Danny can surpass the pair of them,’ he said.

‘Hodgson can do with his hands what Danny can do. He is a great distributor and that would be a great contest. But they will probably start with Farrell and he is a machine. He might not be the flashiest, but England haven’t gone too far wrong with him in the team and Saracens have built a team around him.’
