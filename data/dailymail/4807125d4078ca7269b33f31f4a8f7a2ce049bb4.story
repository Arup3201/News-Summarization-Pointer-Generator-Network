Baltimore police officers disarmed a man who told them he was ordered by the Black Guerrilla Family, a violent prison gang, to smuggle a loaded gun into a city police station.

Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said 29-year-old Jason Armstrong walked into the Northeastern District substation about 8 a.m. Tuesday smelling strongly of marijuana. 

Batts said officers noted Armstrong's strange behavior and searched him, finding marijuana, cocaine and a .22-caliber handgun with a round in the chamber.

When officers interviewed Armstrong, Batts said, he told them he had been ordered by the Black Guerrilla Family (BGF) gang to smuggle the contraband into the station house to test the department's security.

'An organized gang in the city of Baltimore sent an armed suspect into our building to see our security, to test our security,' Batts said at a press conference filmed by WMAR.

Batts also said 'We're not going to cower. We're not going to back down. We're not going to shy away from tough situations. We will be a constitutional police department.' 

'I'm not going to sit on my heels and wait for it to happen again,' Batts said. 'We will move forward and hold those people responsible for sending him into that police station. We will hold them accountable.'

WMAR reported that BGF was behind a scheme to sell drugs from Baltimore Detention Center, and that both employees at the facility and BGF members have been indicted.

Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez also spoke at the press conference, and said of Armstrong 'He did not go in there on his free will. This person had very little option, according to his statement.'

'We have verified as much as we can now his affiliation and his prior contacts with the police,' Rodriguez also said. 'We know of incidents that took place before that caused him to be in this situation.'

Officers said late Tuesday that Armstrong had been charged with weapons and narcotics offenses.

The FBI issued a memo last month warning of potential threats against police officers nationwide.

The incident also comes less than a month after the December 20 slayings of NYPD Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu by Issmaiyl Brinsley, who earlier wrote online he was 'putting wings on pigs.' Brinsley killed himself after the fatal shooting.
