With quite so many bundles of joy all lined up together, a bonny baby contest will inevitably involve the odd tantrum.

In the Wiltshire town of Devizes, however, it’s not the toddlers who are throwing their toys out of the pram – it’s the grown-ups.

The annual event has provoked a row after carnival organisers cancelled it for being ‘unfair’ to the children deemed less than bonny.

Last year's winners: Organisers of Devizes Carnival, in Wiltshire, have ruled the 'bonny baby' contest is 'no longer an appropriate item' for the event. Pictured are last year's winners

But they reckoned without the mothers of Devizes, who have accused the committee of excessive ‘political correctness’ – and launched their own unofficial bonny baby contest. 

Stephanie Gale, 28, is the mother of one of last year’s winners, Toby. She said: ‘It’s a bit of fun and everybody likes looking at pictures of babies.’

Support: The alternative pageant has won the backing of Devizes Mayor Pete Smith (pictured), who said the event brings the community together

But Dave Buxton, of Devizes Outdoor Celebratory Arts, which organises the carnival, said: ‘It’s a really modern carnival with hundreds of people taking part.

‘Do you really think it is a good idea to judge babies and decide which ones are the best?

'We are a community arts organisation and it is not really appropriate.

‘It just doesn’t seem a very nice thing to do. Everyone believes that their baby is the best baby.

'How do you feel if your baby isn’t the one that has won?’

Organisers have also abolished the role of Carnival Queen this year as it does not ‘fit with the ethos’ of the event.

The carnival procession will be held on August 31, with an unofficial ‘Mayor’s Baby Show’ four days beforehand.

The alternative event has been organised by the former chairman of Devizes Carnival, Jeanette Von Berg, and endorsed by mayor Peter Smith.

He said: ‘The committee are doing a good job, but people like the old-fashioned stuff. 

‘They like to take their kids along and say “Granny did this when she was a little girl”.

‘The mums said it was political correctness gone mad and I agree – it’s absolutely stupid.’
