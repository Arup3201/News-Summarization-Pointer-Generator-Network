In a tearful jailhouse interview, 17-year-old murder suspect Brett Pearson has revealed how meth abuse led him to plot a shooting that would kill his mother and injure his father.

'None of this was supposed to happen,' he said, sitting in the Marion County Jail. 'I should still be sitting at home with both my parents eating dinner. I should wake up every morning in my bed going to school, getting my education. I should see my girlfriend tomorrow 
morning at 11 o'clock and spending the day with her, making her dinner.'

Pearson's mother, Michelle Pearson, 44, was found dead in their Oregon home at 11:30 p.m. Wednesday along with husband Bill Pearson, 57, who was also seriously injured by gunshots.

Regret: In a tearful interview, Pearson said he would never have fired a gun at his parents if not for the influence of drugs

Bill Pearson is expected to recover from his injuries but remains hospitalized.

Pearson spoke of his horrible regret and detailed the meth use that led to that horrible day in an interview with Fox 12.

'Regardless of being under the influence, it's still a decision I 
made,' Brett Pearson said. 'It's still something I did. It's 
still something that was very wrong and should never have happened.'

Pearson said his friend, Robert MIller II, 17, was the one who shot his mother. He admitted to shooting his father himself.

Miller is also facing murder charges and police have yet to confirm who they believe fired on who.

The boys had planned the shooting while high on meth.

'I want people to know that I am sorry for what I did, not because I 
got caught, not because I'm sitting here in this garment, not because 
you're in front of me,' Pearson said. 'But 
because I'm truly sorry that I let myself make the choices I made and 
that I got so far gone that I decided to try to take somebody's life, 
including my own parents.'

Both boys will be tried as adults.

They are being held without bail.

Brett Angus Pearson was pulled over by police about 90 minutes after the body of his mother was found.

Miller was arrested at a Salem motel he had checked into.

Pearson allegedly posted a chilling message on Facebook in the hours before the murder, and friends of the teenager say he had talked previously of killing his mom.

Charged: Pearson, 17, is to be tried as an adult for murder and attempted murder

In the Facebook post, made at 5.12pm on the day of the murder, he wrote: 'Life's about to change in a number of ways!'

The comment was 'liked' by his co-accused, Miller.

'Brett told me a couple months ago, that in a joking but serious manner, "Iâ€™m going to kill my parent",' Teya Zimick told Koin.

'All my friends laughed because we were like, "You are not going to kill your parents, Brett".'

She added that when she brought it up recently, Pearson said he had been joking.

Police arrived at the Pearson family home in Keizer just before 11.30pm, after an alarm was activated inside it.

When officers went inside they found Mrs
 Pearson had died from gunshot wounds. Her husband had been shot and was
 taken to hospital. He is expected to survive.

No motive has been suggested for the killing and friends of the Pearson family were shocked to hear of it.

Message: A few hours before the body of his mother was discovered, Pearson posted this statement on Facebook, which was liked by Miller

Chilling joke: Friends of Brett Pearson claim he had joked about killing his parents a few months ago

'I've known them for 10 years, just 
really nice people. I 
don't know what would have brought this on,' Theresa Whisenhunt told KGW.

Pearson
 and Miller have been charged with murder, attempted murder and 
conspiracy to commit murder. They will be tried as adults.
