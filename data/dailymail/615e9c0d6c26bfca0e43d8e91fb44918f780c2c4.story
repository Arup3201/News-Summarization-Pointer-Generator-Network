It's only logical that Kirstie Alley has been called out by Star Trek fans for paying tribute to the wrong Spock.

The actress raised the heckles of Trekkies Sunday when she wrote a tribute on Twitter seemingly honoring a real-life celebrity child psychologist instead of the fictional science officer of USS Enterprise portrayed by the late actor Leonard Nimoy.

'Rest in peace Dr. Spock ... Xxxooo,' Alley wrote in a message accompanying a black-and-white still photograph of Nimoy as the half-Vulcan first officer under the command of Captain James T. Kirk.

Twitter gaffe: Kirstie Alley has been called out by Star Trek fans for calling Leonard Nimoy's character 'Dr Spock' instead of 'Mr Spock'

The vintage image also features a young Kirstie Alley as the Romulan Lieutenant Saavik, who appears to be going in for a kiss with Nimoy's stone-faced Spock in the 1982 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan.

Alley was later replaced in the role by the actress Robin Curtis.

The 64-year-old TV and film actress unwittingly eulogized Dr Benjamin Spock, a famed pediatric psychoanalyst and the author of the mega best-seller Baby and Child Care who passed away in 1998 at age 94.

Fans of the successful science fiction franchise Star Trek wasted no time pointing out Alley’s mistake.

'That's *Mr.* Spock. Dr. Spock was the baby expert,' user Eric Fettmann reminded the Look Who's Talking star.

Another Star Trek fan Julie Smith wrote: 'ROFL Dr. Spock gave our parents advice about how to take care of us!'

But others have come to Alley's defense, insisting that the actress' slip-up was just an innocent mistake.

Alley, who was out of the country when Leonard Nimoy passed away Friday at age 83, defiantly responded to the flurry of tweets about her gaffe about an hour later.

Outspoken: Alley, 64, has defended her tweet in a follow-up message, insisting that honorary titles notwithstanding, the sentiment was the same 

Live Long and Prosper: Nimoy passed away Friday after a long battle with lung disease. He was 83. 

'I'm sure Mr. Spock had PHD's in Science...anyway the sentiment is the same..jeez...hard to make gestures on here without Trek police..RIP,' she retorted.

Nimoy, who played Mr Spock for 47 years, was laid to rest Sunday in Los Angeles following an intimate ceremony attended by family and close friends.
