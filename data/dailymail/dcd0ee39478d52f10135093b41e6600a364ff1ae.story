Nigella Lawson's former PA who was cleared of fraud has started dating a married former policeman who gave her advice during her trial, it emerged today.

Francesca Grillo, 35 — cleared of swindling £685,000 from the celebrity chef in December — has become romantically involved with former policeman Adam Denton-Beaumont after they met through friends.

The 35-year-old ex-constable has recently split from his hospital consultant wife Ruth — and supported Francesca and her sister Elisabetta, 41, during the trial.

The Grillo sisters had been accused of spending 
£685,000 on credit cards given to them by Nigella Lawson (left) and her 
ex-husband Charles Saatchi (right)

Francesca described Mr Denton-Beaumont, who is now a construction manager, as her 'rock' adding how he had given her and her sister 'lots of solid advice and support'.

She told The Sun: 'We only got together romantically in the last few weeks and are very happy.'

Mr Denton-Beaumont added the pair had helped each other through 'tough times'.

Mr Denton-Beaumont's wife Ruth, 33, who said she separated from her husband three weeks ago, has claimed Francesca stole him.

She said: 'For a long while I suspected they'd been having an affair. He's denied it.'

Meanwhile, her former boss Nigella sparked her own controversy today after posting a recipe for 'slut's spaghetti', known in Italian as 'pasta alla puttanesca', as her recipe of the day on Twitter.

The TV chef posted a link for the unusually named dish alongside the phrase 'Do I need to say anything more?'.

But just moments later she posted 
again insisting: 'Folks: no agenda behind #recipeoftheday! Slut's 
Spaghetti an old fave of mine.'

The message sparked speculation as to whether Miss Lawson was referring to anybody in particular.

It comes after her former husband Charles Saatchi's new companion Trinny Woodall made 
what appeared to be a tasteless joke at her expense.

Writing
 about turning 50 on the high50 website last night, Ms Woodall said: 
'It’s great that, at 50, life can still grab you by the throat and shake
 you up.'

Miss Lawson's 
Twitter message linked to her website which included the ingredients and
 a colourful description of the fiery dish.

Nigella Lawson posted a recipe for 'slut's spaghetti' to her Twitter feed today

A short while after the initial message was posted she tweeted this message

It
 read: 'Well how could I resist this translation of pasta alla 
puttanesca, whore's pasta as it usually is described in English?

'The
 general consensus seems to be that this is the sort of dish cooks up by
 slatterns who don't go to the market to get their ingredients fresh, 
but are happy to use stuff out of jars and tins.

'I
 hold my hands up to that. Or maybe one should just attribute the name 
gamely to the fiery tang and robust saltiness of the dish?'

The
 message was retweeted dozens of times with one user Hassinator69 
saying: 'It's nothing to do with using jars or sauces but I'm sure you 
know this and are just being polite.'

A
 short while after that message was posted Miss Lawson posted a reply 
which read: 'Folks: no agenda behind #recipeoftheday! Slut's Spaghetti 
an old fave of mine.'

Ingredients for the pasta dish include anchovies, garlic, chilli flakes and olives as well as spaghetti.
