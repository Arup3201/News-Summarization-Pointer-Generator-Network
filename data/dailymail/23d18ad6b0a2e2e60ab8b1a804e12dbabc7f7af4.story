A leader in the Islamic community has refused to condemn the actions of 18-year-old Numan Haider, who stabbed two police officers before one of them shot him dead.

The Islamic council of Victoria secretary Ghaith Krayem stopped short of defending the teenager, who was known to police and had apparently been seen in his local area brandishing an ISIS flag.

Mr Krayem told The Age on Wednesday evening he refused to condemn Haider's actions, taking a swipe at authorities for taking an' enforcement' approach to the threat of terrorists at home. 

He described the underlying factors behind it as social rather than religious, and accused authorities of pre-empting the outcome of Tuesday evening's events.

Islamic council of Victoria secretary Ghaith Krayem said authorities' approach to stopping home-grown terrorism wasn't working 

'I'm not going to condemn what he did because I don't know what he did and I think it's wrong for anybody to be condemning this young man until the full investigation takes place and we actually understand what occurred,' Mr Krayem said.

'It is incumbent on us as a society not to forgo our own principals and values that make us who we are and one of those is the presumption of innocence, even for a deceased person.'

Numan Haider was killed on Tuesday evening outside Endeavour Hills police station south-east of Melbourne, after he stabbed two officers from the joint terror task force during a scheduled meeting.

Mr Krayem also said despite not knowing Numan Haider (pictured), the fact he had been seen with an ISIS flag did not make him a terrorist

An AFP officer and a member of the Victorian Police were both injured during the altercation, before one of the men discharged one bullet which killed Haider.

He was known to police, recently has his passport cancelled, and had been monitored by officers for the past three months.

Mr Krayem also told the website he understood that information about the event had to be given to the public, but criticised some coverage of the shooting asking people to remember that a life had been lost.

He also said that an appearance with the ISIS flag, a bad attitude and a discontent with the way the government is running the country do not necessarily equate to him being a terrorist.

While he didn't know the young man personally, Mr Krayem said Haider's age and immaturity could have been a factor in the event, and reiterated that treating people like 'criminals' off the bat was doing nothing to help Australia.

Leader of the Cyprus Turkish Islamic Community of Victoria, Ekrem Fuldagli, took a difference stance, saying moderate Muslims are nothing like those who sympathise with extremists.

He told 3AW radio: 'The general public at large... are led to believe that these extremists are actually part and parcel of our religion. They're not with us.'

Mr Fuldagli also condemned any violent acts, and said he had been 'Team Australia' as Prime Minister Tony Abbott put it, for many years.
