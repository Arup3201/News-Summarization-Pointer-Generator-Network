The ex-wife of the Chobani yogurt founder has filed a lawsuit claiming that he paid 30,000 euros to a disgruntled former Fage employee so that he could have his competitor’s top secret recipe.

Hamdi Ulukaya, the founder of the billion-dollar Chobani empire, is being sued by his ex-wife Ayse Giray because she claims he is trying to sell of parts of the company so that she loses her 53 per cent stake, even though her holdings are backed up by questionable proof to begin with.

The latest court filing made numerous claims about how Ulukaya allegedly stole checks from his brother and threatened friends to help him first get the company off the ground, but one of the most explosive assertions is about his supposed deal to get Fage’s signature recipe.

Man behind the brand: Hamdi Ulukaya (pictured in 2011) is fighting claims made by his ex wife, who says that he stole the recipe for his famed Chobani brand from his chief rival, Fage

On Friday, a New York court rejected 
Ms Giray's claims and denied her a temporary restraining order to stop 
her ex from pursuing any sale of the company.

'We’re
 pleased with the Court’s decision to deny a temporary restraining order
 and the plaintiff’s decision to withdraw the request for a preliminary 
injunction as the allegations are completely baseless and without merit,' the company spokesman told MailOnline.

Giray claimed  that her ex told her on numerous occasions about how he ‘boasted’ about flying to Europe to meet a former Fage employee and exchange the secret recipe and cooking process for 30,000 euros.

The identity of the supposed corporate traitor has not been revealed, nor has any further information about the covert meeting.

Mr Ulukaya has not publicly commented on the claims but a Chobani spokesman told The New York Post that they were ‘baseless and without merits’. 

Classic Greek yogurt has very simple ingredients, but there is a distinctive taste that differentiates the two brands.

On its website, Fage boasts of how their product is ‘made with a family recipe that dates back to 1926, it contains no added sweeteners, thickeners, preservatives, powdered milk, powdered cream or powdered protein. Just milk, cream and live active cultures to create all natural FAGE yogurt.’

By comparison, Chobani’s website 
explains how they worked for two years ‘discovering the perfect blend of
 stevia, monk fruit and evaporated cane juice’.

Fage uses cow’s milk and live yogurt cultures which are blended together and then strained.

Chobani does the same procedure before adding fruit and sweeteners.

‘It's a thoughtful process that, unlike some of the other guys, ensures we never use preservatives,’ their website reads.

Chobani

Chobani’s website explains how they worked for two years 
‘discovering the perfect blend of stevia, monk fruit and evaporated cane
 juice’.

They use 
regional milk from cows near the company's Fulton County, New York 
headquarters that is then turned into yogurt after a straining process 
'that's been around for generations'.

'This
 special process makes our yogurt extra thick and gives it twice as much
 protein than regular, unstrained yogurts,' their website states.

They then add the combination of natural sweeteners and fruit, depending on the flavor.

‘It's a thoughtful process that, unlike some of the other guys, ensures we never use preservatives,’ the website reads. 

FAGE

 On
 its website, Fage boasts of how their product is ‘made with a family 
recipe that dates back to 1926, it contains no added sweeteners, 
thickeners, preservatives, powdered milk, powdered cream or powdered 
protein'.

'Just milk, cream and live active cultures to create all natural
 FAGE yogurt.’

Fage uses cow’s milk and live yogurt cultures which are blended together and then strained.

'Our
 straining technique removes all of the watery whey from the pasteurized
 cows’ milk, leaving you with only the thick, velvety texture of creamy 
FAGE yogurt,' the website reads.

The alleged instance of corporate thievery is not the only damning claim made by Giray in the filing, which was reported by The New York Post.

She also alleged that her former husband was not against stealing from relatives and friends when he was first trying to get the company off the ground.

He tried funding Euphrates, the original company that later evolved into what is now known as Chobani, by stealing checks from his brother’s account and forging his brother’s signature.

The New York Post also reported that Ms Giray claimed that he stole and forged checks from his brother embezzled a check from his family and threatened that he wouldn’t return it unless he was given $750,000.

Chobani has become a favorite among New York politicians because their headquarters is helping to bring jobs and boost the economy of the upstate farming communities.

Senator Chuck Schumer blasted Russian officials from stopping American athletes from bringing the brand with them to Sochi during the Winter Games and Governor Andrew Cuomo has repeatedly used it as an example of ways that businesses can flourish in the state.

Political issue: Chobani, which is valued at more than $1billion, has become a favorite success story of politicians including New York Lt Governor Bob Duffy (seen with Ulukaya in 2012) but the new court filing claims that Ulukaya paid a district attorney $1million to settle a case

One of Ms Giray's final claims may hurt that chummy relationship, however, as the lawsuit also alleged that her ex paid $1million to the Fulton County district attorney to settle a case about improper yogurt disposal.

Ms Giray has listed off these claims as part of a court filing to try to get a judge to rule that Mr Ulukaya is not legally allowed to pursue any deals with private equity firm TPG, which Chobani is in talks with over a possible 15 per cent sale.

This comes as the latest shot in an ongoing battle over Ms Giray’s claims to the majority ownership.

She has a handwritten note written by Mr Ulukaya in 2003 that said that she was promised a 53 per cent stake in Eyphrates, the original company that came after she reportedly paid $500,000 as an initial investment in the company during their very early stages.

Aside from the note, she has no other proof- such as stock certificates or legal deeds of ownership- to back up her case.
