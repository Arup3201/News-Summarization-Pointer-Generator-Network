Early screenings of the upcoming blockbuster about Noah's ark has opened the floodgates of criticism as the film's director and the studio are at odds over the interpretation.

The Hollywood Reporter states that the epic film, titled Noah, has been screened in front of three audiences with different faith backgrounds and was met with mixed reviews.

The $125million film was shown to a largely Jewish audience in New York, a mainly Christian crowd in Arizona and a mixed group in California.

His vision: Darren Aronofsky, the director behind The Wrestler and Black Swan, has spoken about how has wanted to create a film about Noah's story since he was a boy

Director Darren Aronofsky also introduced the exclusive trailer to an audience at the Echo Conference led by a Texas Church in July and it was widely praised by attendees who posted messages about it on Twitter after the fact.

Interpretation: Questions have been raised about Aronofsky's vision for the film as he has previously stated that he views Noah as 'the first environmentalist'

'Just saw the trailer for Aronofsky's "Noah". It looks like it's gonna be off the chain,' Twitter user Micah J. Murray wrote.

The project is a personal one for Aronofsky, whose recent films The Wrestler and Black Swan were nominated for Academy Awards.

At the Echo conference, The Hollywood Reporter says that he said that he has dreamed of making a film about Noah's story since the seventh grade when he wrote a poem about the biblical figure.

The poem won an award and he read it in front of the United Nations which he said 'gave me the courage and spirit to be a writer. So Noah's very much been a patron saint in my life leading me toward my creative endeavors.'

This vision is apparently one that he does not appreciate being messed with, as unidentified sources told The Hollywood Reporter that he has been 'very dismissive' of the suggestions made by Paramount executives. The studio is splitting the cost of the collossal film with New Regency, so their input is significant but allegedly Aronofsky does not care.

Film marketing consultant Mark Joseph saw one of the pre-screenings of Noah and said that it was 'an example of a director not listening to those voices that would have been warning of the dangers of veering too far away from the biblical text.'

'The director is there to serve the studio and the audience, not veer off into directions that go against the core audience's beliefs- at least if the goal is to get them to come to the theater.'

Big budget: Russell Crowe (left) and Ray Winstone (right) are two of the stars in the film, which doesn't use any actual animals as Aronofsky chose to have them digitally created instead

One such direction is an interpretation of Noah as 'the first environmentalist', which Aronofsky has said in the past.

A writer that obtained an early summary of the film- which uses a great deal of special effects and completely invented the animals that will be used alongside stars like Russell Crowe- and that blogger, named Brian Godawa said that it will be 'an uninteresting and unbiblical waste of a hundred and fifty million dollars'.
