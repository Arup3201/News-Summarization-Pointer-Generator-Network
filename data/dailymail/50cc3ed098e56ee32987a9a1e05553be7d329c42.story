The crisis threatening Greece's Euro membership tonight deepened after a second attempt to end a crippling political deadlock by forming a coalition government failed.

This latest blow came after German politicians broke ranks and actively demanded that Greece gets out of the eurozone.

The calls come amid a meltdown in financial markets across the globe and the common currency sinking further against the pound.

No deal: Radical Left party leader Alexis Tsipras, left, leaves a meeting with New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras, right after failing to reach an agreement to form a coalition government and end the country's political deadlock

Greece now looks set to have to hold a second general election after Radical Left leader Alexis Tsipras gave up on attempts to raise enough support for his anti-austerity agenda.

Tsipras, whose party was the surprise runner-up in weekend national elections, has been seeking support for a left-wing government that will reject the terms of Greece's international bailout - which critics say will lead the country out of the euro.

Tsipras, 38, told a meeting of party 
lawmakers: 'We saw that our proposal enjoys broad social support but 
weak parliamentary backing. 

‘We can't make our dream come true and 
form a left-wing government.’

Tsipras was given the presidential mandate on Tuesday and tasked with forming a government after first-placed conservative leader Antonis Samaras - who backs the country's international bailout terms - failed to do so within hours of getting the mandate on Monday.

Next in line is Socialist leader Evangelos Venizelos, Greece's former finance minister. If he also fails, the president will host party leaders in a last-ditch effort to avoid new elections next month.

If he also fails, elections will be called in three or four weeks in the hope of breaking the deadlock.

Venizelos said he would continue the search for a coalition when his turn comes but there seems little space for compromise between pro and anti-bailout forces, almost equally balanced in parliament.

‘We must form a government and give the country prospects for the future, hope and security,’ Venizelos said

Yesterday, Tsipras said Greece should
pull out of its bailout commitments, saying the financial pain hitting 
ordinary Greeks has been too high.

Samaras
stressed it was imperative for the country to remain in the euro. 
Although he has called for the bailout terms to be renegotiated, he said
pulling out completely would be disastrous.

Portugal has axed four of its 14 national holidays in an attempt to boost the economy.

They have been axed for a five-year period in the hope that extra working time will help boost GDP.

The Catholic holidays All Saints Day and Corpus Christi have been scrapped. The day off to commemorate the formation of Portugal also goes - as does the day to celebrate independence from Spain.

The Catholic Church reached an 'exceptional understanding' with the state over axing the holidays, the Diario de Noticias newspaper reported.

Public sector wages have already been cut and taxes increased to reduce the budget deficit.

Portugal accepted a £63bn bailout from the EU and the IMF last year.

On
the markets the Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks was 
down 1.2 per cent on the back of the deadlock in the Greek government.

There were also very slight losses on the FTSE100 and French CAC 40. The German Dax was up 0.32 percent after falling earlier.

Spain's financial markets were also shaken as investors were worried about the fallout from Greece's political crisis and awaited details of the Spanish government's latest plan to shore up the banking sector.

The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose to 6.02 percent by late afternoon, a jump of 0.24 percentage points on the day and uncomfortably high.

Bond yields indicate the rate the government borrows at when it taps financial markets.

Just
a few weeks ago it would have been heresy for Chancellor Angela 
Merkel's supporters to suggest that Greece throws in the towel - but not
any longer.

'We should make
Greece the offer to leave the eurozone in an orderly fashion, without 
leaving the European Union,” said Klaus-Peter Willsch, the budgetary 
expert for Merkel's CDU party.

He
told Wednesday’s business daily Handelsblatt it was 'not up to the 
Germans to tell the Greeks how to live,' but that weekend election 
results indicated they were 'not willing' to implement the 
Berlin-dictated savings course.

'The dogma that no country can leave the eurozone has already caused too much political damage in Europe,' he added.

Michael Meister, deputy chairman of the CDU in parliament, said; 'It is clear that if the new Greek government, contrary to expectations, does not keep to the contracts, it will have to accept the consequences already announced.'

Frank Schäffler, a finance expert 
from the CDU’s coalition partner the Free Democratic Party, also said he
was open to a possible exit of the Greeks from the eurozone. 'One must 
be prepared,' he added.

'The government should now, at the very latest, draw up a plan B.'

The head of economics at the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich, Kai Carstensen, said: 'It is absolutely correct to develop a Plan B which would enable the exit of Greece in the most orderly fashion

'At the moment that which many have feared is happening – the necessary internal devaluation through wage and price reductions is politically barely tenable.'

Greece is in its fifth year of recession with unemployment at 20 percent – and had committed itself to earmarking in June another €11.5billion in savings over the next two years. All bets are off after the weekend vote which saw people vote against more austerity.

Germany's Der Spiegel magazine ran the headline yesterday 'Welcome to Weimar' in an essay about Greece - a reference to the post WW1 republic in Germany that collapsed under chronic debt triggered by the Great Depression and which ushered in the Nazis.

Alexis Tsipras, leader of Greece's Radical Left Coalition party (SYRIZA), has said that the recent Greek elections rendered the bailout agreement invalid, which sent tectonic shocks to stock markets around the world, including London.

Germany has warned that it must stick to the savings course if it wants to remain in the euro.

'Greece must know that there is no alternative to the agreed to restructuring arrangement, if it wants to stay a member of the euro zone,' said ECB board member Jörg Asmussen. He said it country risked missing a 130 billion euro tranche of bailout money due soon if it backed away from the previous savings agreement.

Sunday's parliamentary elections in Greece left the country with no clear winner, as voters rejected mainstream pro-austerity political parties, and split their votes among several splinter parties, ranging from the extreme left to neo-Nazis.
