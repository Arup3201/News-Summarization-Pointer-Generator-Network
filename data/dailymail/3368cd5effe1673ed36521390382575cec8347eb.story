France has quietly scrapped its 75 per cent income tax on millionaires.

The super tax of Socialist President Francois Hollande was promoted in 2012 as a symbol of fairness, a financial contribution from the wealthiest at a time of economic crisis.

But it netted only a fraction of its projected proceeds and has been rewritten as a 50 per cent tax paid by employers.

President  Hollande's super tax was rejected by a court, rewritten and ultimately netted just a sliver of its projected proceeds.

It ends on Wednesday and will not be renewed.

The tax of 75 percent on income earned above one million euros was promoted in 2012 by the newly-elected Hollande as a symbol of a fairer policy for the middle class, a financial contribution of the wealthiest at a time of economic crisis.

But the government was never able to fully implement the measure. It was overturned by France's highest court and rewritten as a 50 percent tax paid by employers.

Faced with a stalling economy and rising unemployment, the government reversed course in 2014 with a plan to cut payroll taxes by up to 40 billion euros ($49 billion) by 2017, hoping to boost hiring and attract more investments.

It affected only a small number of taxpayers, but triggered huge protests in business, sporting and artistic communities.

Actor Gerard Depardieu criticised it and took Russian citizenship and football clubs threatened to boycott matches for fear that 114 of their players or coaches would be taxed. The final version of the tax allowed them to minimize the burden. 

Tax experts said it had a devastating impact on the attractiveness of France for foreigners.

The tax is estimated to have raised £328 million. By comparison, France's budget deficit has soared to well over £62 billion.
