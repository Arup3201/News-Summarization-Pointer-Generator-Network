This is the spectacular moment twin waterspouts formed over Lake Michigan.

The funnels of water, created when tornadoes develop above the sea, were captured towering over the lake off the Wisconsin shore, near the city of Kenosha.

They were sighted a couple of miles off shore, spinning above the water under a large mushroom cloud.

Waterspouts are created when tornadoes develop over the sea.Layers of cool air blowing over the water cause warm, moist air to sweep up from underneath and form a column of condensation.They can move as fast as 80 miles an hour, with inside winds spiraling from 60 to 120 miles an hour.The 'water twisters' can last up to half an hour.

They are most common in the Florida Keys, where there can be as many as 500 each year.

An eye-witness managed to capture video footage of the breathtaking moment, which was released by Kenosha News yesterday.

Waterspouts, which can spin as fast as 80 miles an hour, occur when a tornado forms over oceans, lakes or other bodies of water.

Layers of cool air blowing over the water cause warm, moist air to sweep up from underneath and form a vortex of condensation.

The twin waterspouts, which were spotted at Lake Michigan at about 1.30pm (7.30pm GMT) on Thursday, 
were a result of ideal weather conditions, according to a U.S. National 
Weather Service meteorologist.

He
said warmer lake temperatures and very cold air higher up in the 
atmosphere had combined to make the air unstable - leading to the formation of the waterspouts. 

The
twin funnels, which initially merged into one large waterspout before 
splitting, were not expected to spin on to land. However, more were 
predicted throughout the day. 

The waterspouts formed after warmer lake temperatures combined with very cold air higher up in the atmosphere,  according to a U.S. National Weather Service meteorologist
