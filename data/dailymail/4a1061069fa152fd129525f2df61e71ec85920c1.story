The athletes at this year’s Winter Olympics won’t be the only stars of the show - individual visitors will also be given their own moment in the spotlight. 

Thousands of ticket holders will have 3D portraits of their faces beamed onto the side of the pavilion in the Olympic village.

The façade of the building has been designed to work like a Pin Art toy and will move and change shape as the faces change.

Russian mobile phone firm MegaFon plans to scan the faces of its customers, as well as visitors to the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and show the portraits as giant pin art in the Olympic Village in February. The MegaFaces pavilion, concept pictured, will continuously change shape to show these different faces throughout each day

Each visitors' face will be photographed from five different angles to capture an accurate 3D view.

The MegaFaces system will then take one minute to turn these five shots into a 3D model.

Actuators built into the pavilion's facade will register the different contours of the scanned faces and move pin-style blocks into position,

Faces will continually change throughout the day.

Concept images show that three faces will be shown on one side of the building at a time, and visitors will be told what 
time their portrait will appear.

For people who have their photo taken 
but can’t get tickets to the events, MegaFon will also be filming the 
structure throughout the games and people can watch it on a website.

To capture the portraits, 3D photo booths have been set up in MegaFon mobile phone stores across Russia.

There will  also be booths positioned throughout the 2000 square metre pavilion and grounds when the games begin in February.

The mobile firm teamed up with London-based architect Asif Khan to design the giant pin screen, called MegaFaces. 

The screen is made up of over 10,000 actuators that register the different shapes of the scanned faces, and move the ‘pin-style’ blocks into position. 

Faces will continually change throughout the day, and will be illuminated at night.

They can then download a video of their avatar’s appearance. 

Once the games have finished, the building, dubbed Digital Mount Rushmore, will be moved to Moscow. 

Khan said: ‘Even in the digital age we still use emoticons when texting to show how we feel. 

‘The concept is that the human face is still the strongest way of conveying emotion.

He continued that he wants everyone to be given the ‘opportunity to be the face of the Olympics.'

The Sochi Winter Olympics take place between the 7 and 23 February.
