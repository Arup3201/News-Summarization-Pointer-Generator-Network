A 12-year-old girl has killed herself after relentless online bullying from her classmates, her family has claimed.

Gabrielle Molina's 15-year-old sister found the young girl hanging in a bedroom at her family's home in Queens Village, New York on Wednesday afternoon, police said.

The girl, who attended a local middle school, left a heartbreaking note explaining that she had taken her life after suffering taunts online from her classmates, the New York Post explained.

In the letter, she also apologized to her family - her sister, 21-year-old brother Geonel, and parents George and Glenda - for taking her life.

Her mother told police that Gabrielle was depressed over the taunts and revealed that her other daughter, Georgia, had forced her way into the bedroom when Gabrielle did not answer.

Gabrielle's aunt, Irma Molina, told the Post that she didn't understand the young girl's death.

'She's very quiet, very friendly,' she said. 'She wanted
to dance and sing. Sheâ€™s so young.'

Neighbors also told the Post of their shock at the death of the young girl, whose family has lived at the home for nearly 10 years.

'They're just a wonderful family,' said a neighbor. 'It's just so sad. I don't know how they are going to get by.'

The National Crime Prevention Council notes that 43 per cent of teens are subject to cyberbullying, and there have been recent, high profile cases.

In one heartbreaking story, 15-year-old Felecia Garcia killed herself last October after fellow students allegedly posted a video of her having sex with members of the football team.

She was branded a 'slut' and humiliated by her classmates online, eventually taking her life by jumping in front of a train.
