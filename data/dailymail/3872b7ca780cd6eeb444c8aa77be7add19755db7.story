Angrily thwacking the ketchup bottle to coax out the stubborn sauce could soon be a distant memory, after scientists invented an edible non-stick coating.

Applying just a thin layer of the tasteless substance – known as Liquiglide - to the inside of the bottle creates a slippery surface allowing the contents to slide straight out.

The non-toxic lubricant can be used on both plastic and glass containers to ensure that consumers can enjoy every last drop of not only their favourite tomato sauce, but other sticky condiments as well, such as mustard and mayonnaise.

The ingenious Liquiglide Ketchup Bottle, created by engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came third in the inaugural Visitor Vote for the Design Museum’s Designs of the Year 2013.

According to the inventors, each year an estimated one million tonnes of condiments are thrown away globally because leftovers cannot be scraped from jars and bottles, with up to 15 per cent of a product remaining in its container.

They also claim that eliminating safety caps on squeeze bottles could save 50,000 tons of plastic a year.

Not only does the product save waste and reduce the need for packaging, but it could stop your beer or cola going flat.

The smoother surface created by coating the inside of cans and bottles for carbonated drinks with the substance, slows the release of carbon dioxide bubbles from a drink, keeping it fizzy for longer.

The first consumer product with Liquiglide coating is expected to hit supermarket shelves by next year.

Since June visitors have been voting for their favourite entries from the 99 nominations for Designs of the Year in a polling station at the exhibition.

Other entries included The Shard, the London 2012 Olympic Cauldron and GOV.UK - a revolutionary website combining all of the UK’s government websites under one single domain – which was named official Design of the Year Winner 2013.

Previous victors include the London 2012 Olympic torch and a folding plug.

But the winner of the newly-introduced public vote, announced yesterday, was Child ViSion, a fluid-filled lens that allows children to self-adjust the prescription strength of their glasses.

Designed for children aged 12-18, it 
uses fluid lenses that allow children without access to an optician to 
change their prescription as their eyesight changes and evolves.

Professor
Josh Silver, designer of the Child ViSion glasses, said: ‘We are 
delighted to have won the Visitor Vote. There are two aspects to 
eyewear, firstly it has to function properly and give you clear vision, 
but equally important, it also has to look good.

‘It’s great that the public have taken this design to their hearts and voted us their design of the year.’

A 3D exoskeleton made from printed sheets of plastic, known as ‘magic arms’, came second in the public vote.

The design is light enough to be worn by a small child with muscloskeletal disabilities, and provides them with better movement and the ability to lift objects.

The exhibition closes on Sunday
