Like any typical teenager, Ryan Kitching
resisted all his mother's attempts to get him to tidy his bedroom.

For two weeks, the 19-year-old turned a
deaf ear to all her pleas for him to clear up the mess.

But when he finally gave in and started
sifting through the junk, he found a lottery ticket from the February 8 draw.

And instead of tossing it in the bin, he had it checked - and found it had five
winning numbers and a bonus ball.

Ryan Kitching, 19 was nagged by his mother Susan (both pictured) into finally tidying up his bedroom - and struck gold by finding a lost lottery ticket worth £52,981

Ryan, of Penicuik, Midlothian, is still torn about what to do with his winnings. He has been enjoying nights out with his friends and is considering a 'lads' holiday' to Magaluf

Suddenly, supermarket worker Ryan, of
Penicuik, Midlothian, found himself £52,981 the richer and posted on his
Facebook page: 'Special thanks to my mum for putting up with me haha!'

Now he plans to reward his long-suffering
mother Susan and father Raymond by arranging for them to go on holiday.

Describing how he struck lucky, he said:
'My room needed a good clean and my mum had been  nagging me for a good
couple of weeks.

'I had just got back from the gym and she
wasn't even home at the time but I knew I'd be in trouble if I didn't clean it
up.

'There was loads of washing up which I hadn't put away and my Xbox games
were lying everywhere.'

Ryan revealed that the money will also be some consolation after he was dumped recently by his girlfriend

As Ryan cleared up the mess, he came across the ticket he had bought from the Tesco store in Penicuik, where he works behind the fish counter

As Ryan cleared up the mess, he came
across the ticket he had bought from the Tesco store in Penicuik where he works
behind the fish counter.

His first instinct was to throw it away:
'But then I thought, "I'm taking my mum shopping anyway - I'll get the numbers
checked, it will do no harm.'"

He left the ticket at the store's kiosk to
get it checked and, as he walked away, a friend shouted after him, saying he
had 'won big'.

He said: 'I had to phone up Camelot and
the woman was asking me lots of questions, and I just wanted her to get to the
point.

'When I gave her the last number of the serial code, she said I had won
£52,981. I just couldn't believe it.'

Ryan is still torn about what to do with
his winnings. He has been enjoying nights out with his friends and is
considering a 'lads' holiday' to Magaluf.

But his father has been doing some nagging
of his own, suggesting more responsible ways of investing the cash: 'He's been
playing the lottery since it started and has never won more than £50, so he's
raging. He wants me to put the deposit down on some property, then maybe rent
it out. 

'But I don't want to move out  just
yet - I still get my tea cooked here.'

Ryan revealed that the money will also be
some consolation after he was dumped recently by his girlfriend.

He said:
'She'll be sad she finished with me now but I'm glad. At least I'll be able to
enjoy the money for myself now and treat myself, for a change.'

He has no plans to quit his job or stop
his work with charity First Response, which trains volunteers to provide
emergency medical aid.

'It's
a great charity and I'm planning on donating some of the winnings to
them,' he said.
