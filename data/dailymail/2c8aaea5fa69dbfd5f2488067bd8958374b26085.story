David Cameron today visited Norfolk to see for himself the extent of flood damage following last week's huge tidal surge.

In Wells-next-the-Sea, the Prime Minister met the residents of homes devastated by a tide which reached the highest level for 60 years.

Dozens of businesses were flooded in Wells and nine homes were damaged, despite sea defences which prevented the situation getting worse.

Smaller communities along the north Norfolk coast suffered even more - in the village of Hemsby, three coastal bungalows fell into the sea.

Mr Cameron, who spent last week touring China alongside British business leaders, paid tribute to the emergency services and flood wardens for their response, but said more could be done.

'These were terrible floods and it was a very difficult event but the resilience of people here in Norfolk must be praised,' he told locals.

'The systems worked well, the flood wardens did a brilliant job and the police, fire service, lifeboats and the whole community pulled together.

'This was a bigger flood than 1953 when 24,000 homes flooded - this time only 1,400 homes were flooded. But that's no help for the people whose homes were flooded this time.'

The Prime Minister called on insurance companies to pay out promptly, and vowed to ensure that householders had support in restoring their homes.

'There's always more to be done and always lessons to be learned,' Mr Cameron said. 'Whether that's personal flood defences that householders can put in, new flood defences the Government should be funding, or even better working between emergency services and local authorities.

'You can always do more but, if there had been no defences, some 800,000 homes could have been flooded and that shows how far we've come.'

North Norfolk MP Norman Lamb, who has helped launch an appeal to assist those affected, escorted Mr Cameron on his visit to Wells.

They visited the Standard House Chandlery which lost much of its stock as water levels reached four foot inside the store and the Golden Fleece pub on the quay front.

Steve Brundall, who runs a restaurant above the pub, said: 'The water came up to the window sill and has damaged the walls, the floors, everything.

'Before the tidal surge we did everything we could to protect the place - we had to drive 30 miles to find sandbags because we couldn't get hold of any locally.

'We're now on the phone constantly to the insurance company, trying to get a pay-out. Hopefully we'll reopen this weekend but it won't be until March that we can have a full re-fit.'

Mike Strong, who co-ordinates the flood response locally, said one obstacle in preparing for the flood had been a 'cry wolf' mentally as locals had become accustomed to regular flood warnings.

'We were going door to door warning people and we were met almost with contempt and derision,' he added.

'There is a tendency towards complacency and, while the flood defences here are very good, people need to be aware that they are only part of the protection.

'The flood has caused a lot of disruption and hardship further along the coast but, if it helps shake that complacency, it could prove a vital wake-up call.'

Mr Cameron also visited the town's lifeboat station which was flooded and met RNLI crews.
