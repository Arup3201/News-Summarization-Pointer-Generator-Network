The makers of kitchen appliance Thermomix have finally responded to the global backlash they have received over the launch of a new model without warning their customers - including those in Australia - saying they were not allowed to pre-promote it as part of 'distribution arrangements'.

Customers who recently purchased the old model TM31 for $1,939 say they feel tricked and would have waited to purchase the new generation TM5, which came out in Australia on Saturday and is only $50 more expensive, had they been informed.

The older model is now $250 cheaper in Australia.

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, the manufacturer said they were 'deeply sorry' the September 6 launch had 'resulted in some of our very valuable customers feeling disappointed'.

The company said it had not touted the coming product because the practice was 'in line with global brand compliance' and 'in accordance with our distribution arrangements which did not allow for any pre-promotion of the new product'.

'We value every one of our customers and recognise that this is not an ideal situation for everyone involved,' the statement said.

'We understand the position of our customers that recently purchased a TM31 and are taking this issue very seriously.

'The TM31 is and always will be an excellent appliance and will continue to be supported just as we have with the previous model the TM21 which is still supported today, ten years after its launch into the market.'

Thermomix also added they were working on addressing the concerns of customers who had recently purchased a TM31 model and were committed to providing the best level of service to their 'very passionate customer base'.

The Facebook pages of Thermomix in Australia, Thermomix UK, Thermomix Deutschland (Germany), Thermomix Spain, Thermomix Polska (Poland) and Thermomix France are among those that have been hit with complaints.

Consumer group Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey said the organisation had been flooded with complaints.

'I think $1900 is a lot of dough to pay for an old mixer and clearly consumers can feel let down by Thermomix,' Mr Godfrey told Daily Mail Australia.

'We don't think they've broken any laws but clearly they have broken trust with a very loyal customer base and I think they're going to pay a price.'

The German-designed 'twelve appliances in one' device has an almost cult-like following.

They cannot be bought in stores, and shoppers hold 'Thermomix parties' similar to Tupperware parties where a Thermomix consultant comes out to a customer's home and demonstrates how it works to a group of their friends. There are more than 3000 Thermomix consultants across Australia.

In Australia angry shoppers have set up a 'Thermomix unhappy customers' Facebook page which has almost 1,700 likes.

Others have complained to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and state Fair Trading departments, and a change.org petition started by Georgina Shelley from Brisbane has received more than 1,350 signatures.

In her petition statement Ms Shelley claims customers and consultants were kept in the dark.

'Many like myself, asked the question before purchasing, if there was a new Thermomix on the way,' she wrote.

'My consultant told me that she hadn't heard anything about it.'

She continued: 'Thermomix AU have misled customers by saying they didn't know about the new model and couldn't disclose this information to customers but as of Saturday when the new model was launched, they had updated their website and were holding training sessions around Australia for their sales teams, using the new TM5. To say they didn't know is an out and out lie.'

Lea Fowler, 58, from Bullsbrook in Perth, bought a Thermomix for herself on August 4 and another for a friend on August 14.

'That really riles me because I've bought her a gift that's already an old model,' Ms Fowler told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's really frustrating, I had the consultant come out and I was very specific about asking her about new models.'

Ms Fowler said customers like her are so angry because $2000 was a lot of money to spend.

'That's why they're copping so much flak, it's not that machine's not worth that kind of money, it's purely that they weren't transparent with what was coming into the market,' she said.

'It was a deception of Australian customers.'

Ms Fowler said she spent years wanting a Thermomix before she finally bought one.

'If you're making risotto you chuck the onion, the butter and the garlic in and it chops the onion, sautés it with the garlic and then your add your rice and stock and set it to cook and it does it all,' she said.

'You come back after 10 minutes and it's done.'

The old model TM31 is now retailing for $250 cheaper

Peta Sargent, 40, from Dee Why in Sydney, is an admin on the 'Thermomix unhappy customers' Facebook page and said some customers who ordered their device after August 20 had been offered a refund or upgrade to the new model.

But Ms Sargent, who ordered hers on August 18, has been told she does not qualify.

An email from Thermomix Customer Service told her: 'Your Thermomix consultant did not know about the new product at the time of your demonstration and has been presenting the Thermomix of proven quality and value.

'Decisions about the release of new models are not made by Thermomix but are made by our overseas manufacturer and are confidential until Thermomix in Australia are officially notified to release such information to Customers and the public.'

It continued: 'The Thermomix Model 31 is an amazing kitchen appliance that will live up to all that you were shown at the demonstration which lead you to your purchase.

'I understand with all the talk and hype of a new model this can make you feel let down, but please think back to the reasons you purchased the Thermomix, as the TM31 has certainly not been superseded by the new model and will live up to all that it is designed to do as per your presentation.'

An ad spruiking the new model claims it has 10 per cent more capacity, a new locking system 'for better handling', a touch screen, a new measuring cup and says it is quieter and more powerful than the old model.

The company website claims home cooks can throw ingredients in their Thermomixes and are able make 'salads in 6 seconds', 'cake mix in 30 seconds', 'sauces and gravies in five minutes' and 'soups in 20 minutes'.
