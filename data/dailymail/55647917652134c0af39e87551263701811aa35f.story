This is the shocking moment an angry mob refused to let an animal welfare charity rescue a injured performing elephant who had been abused.

Indian elephant Mohan is kept shackled with heavy chains around his legs and is often left malnourished and injured, with his owners forcing him to beg on the streets.

It prompted charity Wildlife SOS to launch a rescue operation to save Mohan and give him much needed treatment.

A mob of 300 people surround Mohan as animal welfare charity Wildlife SOS attempt to rescue the abused elephant 

The charity were forced to call in the police to help out with the operation, which was eventually aborted on safety grounds 

But when the 55-strong team descended on the town of Lalganj in northern India to give treatment to the animal, a mob of 300 people surrounded them to stall the operation.

Wildlife SOS were then forced to call the police as the mob became violent with over 40 officers drafted in to try to calm the situation.

But with fears for the safety of the rescue team, a local magistrate ordered the operation to be aborted and the charity had to leave the elephant behind.

Now the elephant's owner, Bhupendar Mishra has been accused of sending the crowd to stop the seizure of the animal.

Mohan is kept shackled by his owners and is often forced to beg and perform for food and money 

The elephant is also kept with heavy chains around his legs, and according to the charity is often malnourished and injured 

Deputy Conservator of Forests, Y.P Shukla said: 'Mr Bhupendar Mishra has illegal custody of the elephant and is trying to manipulate and mislead the crowd. He is being supported by his two brothers.

'He is trying to stall the rescue of the elephant by filing revisions and misleading the courts although he has already lost the court battle.'

Mohan, who is aged 56, was stole from his wild herd more than 50 years ago and has been used as a begging and performing elephant ever since.

Mohan is paraded through the streets at night with leaves and branches tied to his back and is forced to beg 

Mohan was stolen from his wild herd more than 50 years ago and has been exploit in several different Indian towns 

After he was bought, he was chained for several years to be trained before being exploited in several Indian towns, where he has been subjected to abuse and forced to work long hours.

Co-ordinator of Wildlife SOS Baiji Raj said: 'We will leave no stone unturned to rescue Mohan and are hopeful that we can successfully rescue him.

The charity has now set up an appeal on their website to help fund the elephant's rescue.
