Actor Val Kilmer's 19-year-old son Jack has landed his first high-profile fashion campaign, as the face of a new menswear collection for Saint Laurent.

Sporting a variety of classic and stylish designs from the label’s Permanent collection, the teen model showcases the same pouty lips and high cheekbones that his father first became famous for while starring in films such as Batman Forever and Top Gun.

Jack, who is also a budding actor, made his modeling debut in June, when he walked in the brand's spring/summer 2015 'Psych Rock' show.

But the Los Angeles resident's first breakout role came last year, when director Gia Coppola cast him opposite Emma Roberts in Palo Alto, her cinematic adaptation of James Franco's short story collection of the same name.

In April, he told The Huffington Post that he didn't always want a career in showbusiness, but fell in love with acting while filming the teen drama.

'It’s funny, people asked me as a kid all the time, "Do you want to do what your parents do?" And I always said no, because it's different, I don’t know, to be stubborn or something. Because I was a normal kid,' he said.

'But then through this I realized what my parents have been doing their whole lives and I have like a completely different view of acting and I’m kind of really in love with it.'

Miss Coppola praised Jack's performance in the film, telling Teen Vogue: 'Jack is a natural, and Val and I made sure this was his film.'

Jack, whose mother is British actress Joanne Whalley, is slated to appear in two more films next year: indie drama Len and Company, and romantic comedy Aaron Baby Superfecta, which co-stars Elle Fanning.
