Venezuelan lawmakers punched, kicked and shoved one another last night as post-election conflict between Hugo Chavez's heirs and rivals exploded into a brawl on the floor of parliament.

The fighting broke out after the representatives country's ruling party voted to stop opposition members from speaking until they accepted their candidate's loss in the recent presidential election.

The opposition claimed seven of its parliamentarians were attacked and hurt, while government lawmakers blamed the outbreak of violence on their 'fascist' rivals.

Fighting started as the opposition 
protested against a measure to stop them from speaking in the National 
Assembly until they recognised President Nicolas Maduro's April 14 
election win.

Politics in the OPEC nation, which has oil reserves to rival Saudi Arabia, has been left in a volatile state following the death of popular socialist leader Hugo Chavez last month.

Mr Maduro - Chavez's annointed successor - defeated opposition centre-right candidate Henrique Capriles by 1.5 percentage points in the ensuing election.

Mr Capriles has refused to recognise his loss in the vote, alleging that thousands of irregularities were committed and the election 'stolen'.Â 

The vote exposed a nation evenly divided after 14 years of Chavez's socialist rule, which saw him raise taxes on foreign oil companies and redistribute the money to social programmes for health and education.

It shocked many on the left who had expected an easy win for their candidate, a former bus driver.

Mr Capriles is boycotting an official audit of the election result and plans to file a challenge seeking to overturn it in court.

Last night's clash erupted when members of the opposition unfurled a banner in the National Assembly denouncing the measure that has stripped them of most legislative powers until they recognise the election result.

One of the opposition parliamentarians was left with a bruised and bloody face, seen as he gave an interview to a local TV station in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital.

'They can beat us, jail us, kill us, but we will not sell out our principles,' said Julio Borges. 'These blows give us more strength.'

Government parliamentarian Odalis Monzon said she and her colleagues were attacked and beaten during the punch-up.

'Today again I had to defend the commander's (Chavez's) legacy,' she said.

The fighting came after the government-controlled assembly passed a measure denying opposition members the right to speak in the chamber until they recognised Mr Maduro as president.

'Until they recognize the authorities, the institutions of the Republic, the sovereign will of our people, the opposition deputies will have to go and speak (to the private media) but not here in this National Assembly,' said Diosdado Cabello, the head of parliament.

Both sides accused each other of starting the incident, which took place behind closed doors without media present.

In a video that pro-opposition private TV station Globovision said it obtained from a parliamentarian, various assembly members could be seen hitting each other and scuffling to cries of 'stop' from others.

In another potential flashpoint for Venezuela, the government and opposition are planning rival marches in Caracas today to commemorate May Day, which is celebrated around the world as International Workers' Day.

Venezuela has been on edge since the April 14 special presidential election. At least eight people died in violent protests the day after the vote, while there have been scores of arrests in what the opposition is calling a wave of repression.

Mr Maduro has accused the opposition of conspiring with the U.S. to plan a coup.
