A teenager has become the first cancer patient in Britain to have a metal port fitted to his head so doctors can blast  drugs directly at his brain tumour.

James Willetts, 17, had the titanium socket - which was created by a 3D printer - bolted to his skull after traditional treatments failed to halt his aggressive brain tumour.

A 'plug' is screwed into the port which allows chemotherapy drugs to be pumped into the tumour along four hair-thin catheters with pinpoint accuracy. 

James Willetts has now become the first British cancer sufferer to have be fitted with a 'skull socket'

James is one of only three cancer sufferers in the world to receive the risky treatment, called 'convection-enhanced delivery' (CEH), which has not even reached stage one trials.

'The first thing that I thought was that I was going to be like Robocop,' he said. 'But I actually don't really notice it.

'I can feel it when they connect it but once it has connected it is fine. It doesn't hurt.

'When they screw it in I can here a scrapping noise inside my head.'

James, of Taunton, Somerset, was diagnosed with Glioblastoma in January 2014 after complaining of migraines and stress.

James underwent a 12 hour operation at Frenchay Hospital in Bristrol in February to remove the tennis-ball sized tumour, leaving him with short-term memory loss and restricted use of the left side of his body

He underwent a 12 hour operation at Frenchay Hospital in Bristrol in February to remove the tennis-ball sized tumour, leaving him with short-term memory loss and restricted use of the left side of his body.

Although most of the tumour was cut out, it was attached to his thalamus in the centre of his brain and some couldn't be removed safely.

Following the operation, he began oral chemotherapy, radiotherapy and was enrolled on a stage 2 drug test called Avastin from a French pharmaceutical company.

But none of the treatments worked and the tumour began to regrow, leaving the family with few choices.

Fortunately for the teen, he was then selected to take part in the CEH trials carried out by neurosurgeon Professor Steven Gill at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.

A 3D titanium port was fitted to James' head at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, in late October with treatment beginning in November.

He undergoes treatment for several hours over two days, after which he is discharged for six weeks before receiving another dose.

James' father Simon does not blame the NHS for not funding the treatment

James has now received three doses of the chemotherapy - classed as one 'cycle' of treatment - and will have a scan at the end of March to reveal how he has responded.

The concept has been around for nearly a decade but can be dangerous and so had never been used to treat cancer and or had even reached stage one trials.

As a result the NHS would not provide funding and the £36,000 cost of James' treatment so far has been privately donated.

James's family has now set up the Brain Power Trust, to help pay for his future treatment or that of others and have currently raised £8,000.

His father Simon Willetts, 52, said: 'His experience has given him a gift he can share - when you get through it, you've got a unique story to inspire others.' 

'He's got a great sense of humour and everyone says he's incredible,' added his father, a salon owner.

'He's got strengths that I don't know where they come from.

'He's teaching me all the time and his inner strength and spiritual calm have helped us all develop some qualities it takes a lifetime to learn.'
