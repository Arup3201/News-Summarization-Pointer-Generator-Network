Luis Suarez has been named in Uruguay's 23-man squad for Brazil despite suffering from a knee injury.

The Liverpool striker's World Cup was thrown into doubt after undergoing minor surgery a fortnight ago, but coach Oscar Tabarez knows the 27-year-old is pivotal to the Uruguay team.

It means the Premier League's top goalscorer could be back in time to face England on June 19.

Return: Luis Suarez could be back in time to face England for Uruguay on June 19 after being named

Recovering: Suarez was spotted leaving hospital in a wheel chair after a 30-minute anthroscopic surgery

Goalkeepers: Fernando Muslera (Galatasaray), Martin Silva (Vasco da Gama), Rodrigo Munoz (Libertad)

Defenders:
 Maximiliano Pereira (Benfica), Diego Lugano (West Bromwich Albion), 
Diego Godin, Jose Maria Gimenez (both Atletico Madrid), Sebastian Coates
 (Liverpool), Martin Caceres (Juventus), Jorge Fucile (Porto)

Midfielders:
 Alvaro Gonzalez (Lazio), Alvaro Pereira (Sao Paulo), Walter Gargano 
(Parma), Egidio Arevalo Rios (Morelia), Diego Perez (Bologna), Cristian 
Rodriguez (Atletico Madrid), Gaston Ramirez (Southampton), Nicolas 
Lodeiro (Botafogo)

Forwards: 
Luis Suarez (Liverpool), Edinson Cavani (Paris St Germain), Abel 
Hernandez (Palermo), Diego Forlan (Cerezo Osaka), Christian Stuani 
(Espanyol)

The anthroscopic surgery lasted about 30 minutes, and it was thought the forward would be sidelined for at least two weeks.

There were claims Suarez sustained the 
injury on Liverpool's last game of the season, provoking online death threats 
to be sent to Newcastle's Paul Dummett from Uruguay fans.

But if Tabarez needs to rely on his back-up strikers, then he should have little worries.

Ex-Manchester United forward Diego Forlan and PSG striker Edinson Cavani have also been named, in what looks a frighteningly good mix up front for Uruguay.

Liverpool's Sebastian Coates, on loan at Nacional, was also picked for the final squad.

As was West Brom's Diego Lugano and Southampton's Gaston Ramirez.

Alejandro Silva and Sebastian Eguren have been dropped from his provisional squad.

Uruguay's first match comes against Costa Rica on June 15, before they face England in Sao Paolo four days later.

Fit? The surgery was said to keep Suarez out for at least two weeks but being named is a boost for Uruguay

On the mend: Suarez will be pivotal to Uruguay's World Cup hopes, even with Edinson Cavani and Diego Forlan as back up
