Target's beleaguered CEO has apologized for the massive data breach that compromised millions of customers' personal information and has vowed to 'make it right'.

But Gregg Steinhafel, Target's chairman, president and CEO who spoke out in his first interview since last month's attack, admitted that the company still does not know the extent of the breach.

'We are not gonna rest until we 
understand what happened and how that happened,' he told Becky Quick in the CNBC interview. 'I'm 
personally very sorry that this whole event even happened.'

Apologetic: Gregg Steinhafel, Target's chairman, president and CEO, has revealed in an interview that the company does not know the full extent of the data breach across stores last month

Promises: He vowed to improve the company as he spoke with CNBC's Becky Quick in the interview

The holiday season theft is now believed to have affected a whopping 70 to 110 million customers between November 27 and December 15, according to a Target press release, as opposed to the previous estimate of 40 million customers.

The information included names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses.

When Steinhafel learned of the breach, 'my heart sunk', he said. 'It's hard for me to describe the feeling that came over me.'

He said that he's 'still shaken by it' and has had many 'sleepless nights'.

But he added there will be more to come as 'we are not going to sleep until we get it right and we regain the trust of our guest. And we're gonna be better as a result of this'.

It took the company four days to tell customers about the breach - a decision Steinhafel defended.

Breach: As many as 110 million customers may have been affected by the breach during the holiday season

Target ;wanted
 to make sure our stores and our 
calls centers could be as prepared as possible,' he explained, adding 
that employees 'worked around the clock to try and do the right thing'.

The company is still not sure exactly what happened during the breach, he said, but they do know that malware was installed on store registers. The malware has since been removed.

He promised that customers would not have to lose out if their information was used by the hackers.

'Zero liability is zero liability,' he said, 'which 
means Target is paying for any possible fraudulent 
activity on anybody's credit card. We're providing the free credit 
monitoring service so the guest has no liability whatsoever.'

He said that Target will work with the banks to determine who will actually reimburse the consumer.

Targeted: The CEO promised that his employees would be working around the clock to get to the bottom of the hack, and assured customers that they would not be liable for any fraud activity in their accounts

But he accepted that customers have every right to be angry - and that the company still has a long way to go before earning back their trust.

Following the breach, sales plummeted at the store, but on Friday, the company revealed that sales have almost returned to normal levels.

'Clearly, we're accountable and we're 
responsible,' he said. 'But we're gonna come out at the end of this a better 
company. And we're gonna make significant changes.

'We have to do everything possible to make it right by every guest and earn that trust back.'
