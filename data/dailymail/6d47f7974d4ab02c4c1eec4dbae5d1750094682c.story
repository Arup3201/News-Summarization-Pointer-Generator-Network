English galloper Cavalryman has been scratched from the Melbourne Cup, reducing the race to 22 runners.  

The stallion was a 34-1 chance to take out the Melbourne Cup before Racing Victoria head vet Brian Stewart ruled him unfit to race due to a swelling in his foreleg.

Concerns were raised on Monday, when Racing Victoria stewards detected an issue with the Godolphin stable-trained bay.

Cavalryman has been scratched from Melbourne Cup due to a swollen foreleg. He is the second horse to be scratched, after outsider Sea Moon was taken out of the running due to an elevated temperature on Monday.

Cavalryman was considered a chance after Group wins at Meydan, Newmarket and Goodwood this year. 

He is the second horse to be scratched from the race, after outsider Sea Moon was withdrawn due to an elevated temperature on Monday.

Japanese Raider Admire Rakti remains the favourite to take out the $6.2million 'race that stops the nation', whilst Lloyd Williams' runner Fawkner is also tipped to be a chance.  

Cavalryman ran the 2012 cup and was to be ridden by jockey Craig Williams.  

Godolphin, an international racing operation owned by the Vice President of the UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have been racing in the Melbourne Cup since 1998 but are yet to record a win.

Their last hope to break their losing streak in 2014 is with Willing Foe, currently at $26 for the Cup on its maiden Australian appearance.
