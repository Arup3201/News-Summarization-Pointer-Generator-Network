An oil executive  who was found dead inside his burning SUV had smoked marijuana with the two men who allegedly murdered him, according to authorities.

Robert Dodson, 44, was found robbed, hogtied with metal cable and strangled with an electrical cord last month. Dean Walden and Joseph Dodson (no relation) face murder charges over his death.

The victim had become  increasingly paranoid ever since a 17-year-old girl was killed at his Texas home in June, during a botched attempt to stage her own kidnapping.

Walden, 47, told police that he and 31-year-old Joseph Dodson loaded the body of Robert Dodson into his own car and set it alight near a natural gas site in Fort Worth, Texas, according to the Star-Telegram.

Firefighters discovered Mr Dodson's body when they went to put out the fire on October 28.

It is unclear how the murder suspects first came in contact with their victim. According to affidavits seen by the Star-Telegram this week, Joseph Dodson is an Aryan Brotherhood member.

Walden and Joseph Dodson allegedly went to Robert Dodson's home on October 28 with the plan to rob someone who they have not identified.

The three men smoked a joint and as Walden and Dodson were about to leave the oil executive's home, they attacked him. The 44-year-old was restrained and strangled to death before his wallet, credit cards and phone were stolen.

After wrapping the body in a blanket, the alleged killers put the victim in his own car before driving off to collect gas from Walden's girlfriend. They then drove separately to the gas site where they set the car and body on fire before fleeing.

Joseph Dodson, who was on parole, is being held without bail in Tarrant County Jail. Walden, who has also served prison time, was in Johnson County Jail with bail set at $250,000.

Paranoid: Robert Dodson, left, had become fearful since 17-year-old Claudia Hidic, right, was killed at his home

There is not believed to be any link 
between Dodson's killing and the death of Claudia Hidic, 17, who was 
found dead in his backyard after trying to stage her own kidnapping in 
an apparent attempt to extort money from Dodson.

According to friends and relatives of
the oil industry executive, the father-of-three was fearful that 
someone was after him not long before he was murdered. 

Dodson first started acting 'paranoid' after he was arrested on October 4 on suspicion of drug possession.

He was later indicted on the charge and spent a short time in jail. Following his release, Dodson left the Fort Worth area for a couple of weeks but then returned.

The 44-year-old, who served as vice 
president of management for the Dallas-based Buckley Oil Company, was 
the one who found the body of Miss Hidic at behind his house on June 28.

Investigation: Police search for answers in Fort Worth, Texas where Hidic and Dodson lived

According
to authorities, the teenage girl had hired two friends to rob the home 
of the oil executive who was friends with her sister, and she was killed
when a gun battle erupted.

Shortly after the tragic incident, Dodson moved away from the area. His death came on the day that Hidic would have turned 18.

According to the indictment of Hidic’s two alleged accomplices, Terrance Crumley and Curtis Fortenberry, the plan was to pretend that the 17-year-old was a hostage and they were looking for a man named 'Ghost' who owed them $900.

The three knocked on the door of the home and were invited inside, police claim.

Dodson
was not home at the time, but six other people were. One of the men 
inside the home got a pistol from the bathroom and shots were fired.

Fortenberry allegedly told police that he may have accidentally killed Miss Hidic, but his attorney refuted those claims.

Fatal shooting: Miss Hidic had been given $100 loan by Mr Dodson but later returned to demand more money, which he refused to give her

Crumley's attorney, Warren St. John, also said his client was not involved in the shooting.

Hidic, a German national from Bosnia, lived in the Fort Worth area with her sister. She studied at Trinity High School in Euless and worked at the Los Jimadores Tex-Mex Tequila Factory in Bedford.

She dropped out of Euless after leaving a foster family and moved in with one of her sisters. She had reportedly told people, including Dodson, that she needed money.

Just a few days before her death, Dodson had given Hidic a $100 loan. A few days later, she returned to his home and asked for $600 more, but he refused. That's when investigators believe she devised her plan to rob him.
