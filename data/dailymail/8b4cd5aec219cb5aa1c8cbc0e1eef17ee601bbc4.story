Very few jobs come with the following requirement: make toddlers cry.

But they do if you're Alexander Demetriou and your job is playing the baddie in the touring production of Disney On Ice.

'It's brilliant fun being Captain Hook,' the ice skater told MailOnline. 'As a villain you can get away with a lot more than playing a good guy. And if I see a kid crying then i know I'm doing my job! But when I'm dressed up in my costume children seem to cry just looking at me!'

Alexander says performing in his Hook costume while dancing on ice is made difficult because of the outfit's weight

Alex, who  who grew up in Blackpool and has been skating since he was seven years old, plays the pirate in the Peter Pan section of Disney On Ice's touring production, Passport To Adventure.

'I loved Peter Pan when I was a child, so it's terrific performing in it now. It's wonderful to hear all the little kids doing the "tic-tocs" with the crocodile's clock, and seeing their smiling faces light up when all the characters come onto the ice. Of course, they're not meant to smile when they see me!'

Alex explained that the trickiest part of his job is switching between the roles of different Disney characters, changing skating styles to portray different characters.

'As well as performing Captain Hook, I also play David in Lilo & Stitch. He's a bit of a surfer dude so I whizz around the rink more, whereas Hook's skating style is a lot sharper and rougher.

'Plus, Hook's costume itself is very demanding because it's so heavy - the heaviest one on the tour - which means that I actually can't physically jump or spin while I'm wearing it.

'It makes sword-fighting on ice pretty tricky - especially since we use real swords so they're also really heavy.'

Happily, Alex has never skated off the ice with more than the odd finger injury. A cut here, a graze there. Though there was once a slippery situation with a crocodile...

'I've had a few falls - in a live show anything can happen - my best one was once when I was being chased by the crocodile and I'm meant to jump into the audience onto a stairwell - but I tripped and fell face-first into them. Luckily I didn't fall on any small children.'

And being familiar with grueling training sessions, Alex also had a few words of advice for the contestants on the new series of Dancing On Ice.

'Don't get worried about the audience - try to forget there are people watching 
otherwise you'll have falls.

'I always get pre-match nerves. Not as bad
as when I first started, but there's always a little fear in your minds. And I 
don't have any superstitions at all - I think it's best not to, otherwise 
you'll panic.'

(Sadly, his wisdom comes a little too late for Pammy, who exited the show after just one episode following a fall and a slippery wardrobe malfunction.)

'I'd love to do Dancing On Ice,' Alex
added. 'It would be great. I think any other sportsperson would be a 
good partner - they'd be pretty flexible - but really I'd like to be 
partnered with Natalie Portman, because I love her a little too much!'
