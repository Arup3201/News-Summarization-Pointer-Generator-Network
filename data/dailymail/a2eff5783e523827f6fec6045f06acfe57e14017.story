A special prosecutor has been appointed in the Daisy Coleman rape case to re-investigate allegations that the 14-year-old cheerleader was sexually assaulted by an older classmate who plied her with alcohol.

Coleman has also alleged that a second 17-year-old boy recorded the January 2012 incident in the small northwest Missouri town of Maryville using cellphone video.

Today's announcement is a victory for Melinda Coleman, Daisy's mother, who said she is looking forward to answering 
questions in a new review of the case.

Victory for Daisy? Coleman has accused Maryville, Missouri teens Matthew Barnett, 19, and Jordan Zech of raping her when she was 14 in January 2012, and now a special prosecutor has been appointed in to re-investigate the case

Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker will re-investigate the rape allegations made by Daisy Coleman

Melinda Coleman told CNN that she and her daughter just want to be heard and to have the case looked at 'fairly, and with some enthusiasm.'

'We were disappointed that they didn't really do the job. They didn't really collect the evidence, and they didn't seem to care from the beginning. Anything above that would just be extra,' she said.

The case has drawn international 
attention to the town after a seven-month investigation published last 
week by the Kansas City Star raised questions about the transparency of 
the process. 

Felony charges against both boys were 
dropped last year after Nodaway County prosecutor Robert Rice said Daisy
and her family stopped cooperating with the investigation. A claim denied by Daisy's mom. 

The newspaper's story described a town 
where many appeared to be closing ranks around the accused and blaming 
the girl.

In the wake of the fresh scrutiny, Rice asked for a special prosecutor to be appointed and it was announced on Monday that Jackson County prosecutor Jean Peters Baker had accepted the high profile case.

Reopened: Charges against Matthew Barnett, left, and Jordan Zech will be revisited, but news of the circumstances under which they were dropped in March 2012 has the town of Maryville, Missouri taking sides and has the public eager for justice in the case of Daisy Coleman's rape accusations

'Your son is going to get a bullet through his head': The A&G restaurant in town has become the focus of threats from hacktivist group Anonymous, though the owners aren't associated with the accused rapists

She has promised to review the case 'without fear and without favor.'

'I can also assure you that politics, connections or any other reason you can think of will not play a role in our review of this case. It will be the evidence, as it is in every case that we review,' Jean Peters Baker said.

Residents
of Maryville claim they’re now besieged by threats and in-fighting thanks
to the attention that the case has had in the past week.

Townspeople
fear they’re being cast as villains as the case of the new girl in town
who accused two popular teens of rape - only to have the charges 
suddenly dropped - which is now being reopened.

As
the residents are forced to choose sides, news viewers across the 
country eager to create their own justice have even begun to threaten 
people related to the case using phone calls and the internet.

Matthew
Barnett, now 19, and Jordan Zech, were accused by then 14-year-old 
Daisy Coleman of rape after she and a friend went drinking with the boys
in January 2012.

In 
the months after the case was dropped because of an apparent lack of 
evidence, Daisy’s mother Melinda Coleman has been on a quest to get 
justice for her daughter.

'The media have made us look like a bunch of scum': National media scrutiny has many residents, even those who haven't chosen a side in the case, seething. It's done a disservice to Maryville,' said Mahlon Fairchild, 83

Opening up: Paige Parkhurst Borland, seen here with her mother, was with Daisy on the night of the alleged rape. She said that the ordeal was 'very scary'

She
and her family were new in town, and Barnett’s family had local 
political connections that some believed helped him and his buddy get 
off scot-free despite Daisy’s allegations she was given a ‘clear liquid’
that left her incapacitated before she was raped.

And
it all came to a head after the Kansas City Star published the 
Coleman’s story last weekend and Daisy’s story appeared on just about 
every internet news outlet.

Many residents say it put them in an unfair light.

‘The
worst thing to my wife and me is that we have this wonderful little 
town here and you (the media) have made us look like a bunch of scum,’ 
83-year-old Mahlon Fairchild told this Kansas City Star. ‘It’s done a disservice to Maryville, a disservice to our legal system. We’re hurting. We’re hurting. It’s explosive.’

The case has lit a fire under so called online ‘hacktivist’ group Anonymous, who’ve made threats to physically harm some residents and to destroy their property and livelihood.

Scrutiny: Daisy, at right with her mom Melinda, has graced covers and homepages of major media since news of her saga went national last weekend. The town of Maryville has also become the focus of intense scrutiny, much to its chagrin

Dig deep: Shirley Barnett, left, is the mother 
of Matthew Barnett, 19, one of the high school footballers accused of 
raping Daisy Coleman. She called on everybody to 'dig deeper to find the
truth' around the case and said her son is the real victim in the case threats on her son's safety pour into the tiny town

'We're hurting. It's explosive': The home Daisy shared with her family was mysteriously burned after they left town. A threat to torch the Maryville high school has since come from a California Twitter user

The owners of the A&G Greek 
restaurant in town say they get threatening phone calls every day, and 
though their son was attended the party where Daisy claims to have been 
assaulted, he was not implicated in the crime.

‘We got a phone call last night: “Your son is going to get a bullet through his head,”’ one of the owners said Saturday.

Their business’s Yelp review page has been hit by Anonymous, too.

‘SO GENEROUS!’ read such post before administrators removed it. ‘Even once you’re stuffed, they keep bringing you food — almost like it’s against your will! When I told them to stop, they smiled and reassured me that I was asking for it.’

In a statement, Anonymous expressed their outright support of Daisy.

'We demand an immediate investigation into the handling by local authorities of (the victim’s) case. If Maryville won’t defend these young girls, if the police are too cowardly or corrupt to do their jobs, if the justice system has abandoned them, then we will have to stand for them. Mayor Jim Fall, your hands are dirty. Maryville, expect us.'

Rumors: All parties involved with the alleged sexual assault attended Maryville High School. Rumors now abound about bomb threats being called into the school and its football field

Second chances: Though she and her family have fled Marylville, wedged in the center of the ongoing saga is Daisy Coleman. Her case, according to county prosecutors, will now be revisited

Nodaway County prosecuting attorney Robert L. Rice, who says neither politics nor connections played a role in his decision not to pursue the charges, has asked for a special prosecutor to reopen the felony case. Meanwhile, threats and division within the towns own ranks continue.

Resident Tess Fornander, 46, fears what her 11-year-old daughter could be exposed to in the town.

‘I didn’t want her to even possibly hear anything about the girl being wrong,’ she told the Star. ‘Her house was burned down. She had to leave town. It’s just crazy.’

Indeed, the home where Daisy lived with her family was mysteriously burned after the family fled town.

Perhaps to make a statement about the fire, a Twitter user in California posted declared he would burn down the high school.

Murmuring about bomb threats have also fluttered through town, though they are unfounded.

Barnett’s mother Shirley Barnett, who has staunchly defended her son, has called on the public leave the townspeople alone.

'There are universities in the state with children from Maryville and they are having to be walked to class because of threats made over the internet, threats that are being made to them. It’s getting worse and worse,’ Barnett told MailOnline last week.

Former school superintendent Roland Tullberg said opinions of his town are worsening, too.

‘It makes Maryville, to people at a distance across the land, look like a community that doesn’t care about the individual. I want you to know that this community is a very fine community,’ he told the Star. ‘It makes people think we don’t care. We do care.’
