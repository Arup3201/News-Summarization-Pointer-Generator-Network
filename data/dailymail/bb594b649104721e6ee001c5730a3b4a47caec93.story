A year that promised so much has unravelled and left Liverpool with nothing other than cause for regret.

The return to the Champions League was supposed to propel Liverpool back into the big time but their feeble exit at the group stage, with just five points and five goals to show for their six matches, has been like slipping from heaven into hell.

Here, Sportsmail looks at the key dates during 2014 that have seen Liverpool's fortunes plummet.

Brendan Rodgers' season with Liverpool has unravelled and left them with nothing other than regrets

April 20: Norwich 2-3 Liverpool

To think this was just eight months ago. Having beaten Norwich 3-2, Liverpool moved to within seven points of lifting the title. 

Brendan Rodgers had challenged his side to smash through the 100-goal barrier but, amid all that giddiness and euphoria, one key fact had been overlooked - Liverpool had automatically qualified for the Champions League.

'It was an incredible victory and big congratulations to the players,' Rodgers enthused. 'We can't finish lower than third and that guarantees Champions League football. 

'I don't think anyone would have expected that. It shows the magnitude of the effort we have put in and the quality we have shown.'

June 27: Adam Lallana arrives, Liverpool ready to sell Luis Suarez

The key date in Liverpool's summer. Having already brought in Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana becomes their most costly signing of the window on this day at £25million and they bid to sign Lazar Markovic from Benfica.

What is more significant, however, is the fact Liverpool come to the conclusion that they are ready to sell their talisman, Luis Suarez, to Barcelona. 

The fee is good but the 31 goals he scored will not be easily replaced.

August 25 - Mario Balotelli arrives

Liverpool finally signed a headline-grabbing centre forward. Mario Balotelli comes in at £16m and reveals his ambition is to win the Champions League at Anfield.

Only three weeks earlier, though, Rodgers had 'categorically' said Liverpool were not interested in the Italian and the move smacks of desperation after they had missed out on Alexis Sanchez and Loic Remy. 

On the same day, Manchester City put Liverpool in their place, comfortably beating them 3-1. 

Balotelli, laughing in the stands, has struggled to fill the void left by striker Daniel Sturridge's injury at Anfield

September 5: Daniel Sturridge injured with England

During an England training session at St George’s Park, Daniel Sturridge – on whose shoulders there is great responsibility – damaged his thigh.

It was an enormous blow for Rodgers, who needed the striker to take over Suarez’s mantle.

He was expected to be out for four weeks but, almost three months on, he has not kicked another ball. 

With Fabio Borini out in the cold, Balotelli toothless and Lambert’s endeavour not enough, Liverpool’s struggles revolve around their lack of threat. Teams find them easy to play against. 

Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since August and will remain out until next year due to a thigh injury

October 1: Basle 1-0 Liverpool 

The return to Champions League football had been tense and only a late Steven Gerrard penalty had secured three points against Ludogorets.

They had gleaned no confidence, however, and they were wretched in Switzerland, losing 1-0 to Basle. Their performance was as startling as their garish yellow shirts.

With two games against Real Madrid looming, Liverpool were on the back foot.

‘We came to win and I expected a win so it was very disappointing,’ said Steven Gerrard. ‘We didn't deserve anything. We were too soft all over the pitch. It hurts to say they wanted it more. We were second best against an OK team.’

November 23: Crystal Palace 3-1 Liverpool

With the season threatening to go into freefall and none of the new recruits making a significant contribution, Liverpool go to Crystal Palace – scene of their implosion in the title race in May – needing a win to boost confidence levels before they head to Bulgaria for a crucial game against Ludogorets.

What they produce is something out of Rodgers’ nightmares. Palace win 3-1 and Liverpool bear no resemblance to the free spirits they once were.

‘This is more than just a poor start – there's something wrong,’ says Jamie Carragher. ‘Something isn't right. Last year when they came here, we said they were mentally and physically weak. Nothing has changed.'

December 9: Liverpool 1-1 Basle (out of the Champions League)

They may have drawn the game but the result against Basle felt like the worst defeat of all for Rodgers and his team. 

Liverpool did not deserve to get through and their performance at Anfield was a sorry footnote to a European campaign that started poorly and got progressively worse.

They did not learn and everything looked like it was too much for them. Rodgers picked the wrong team in Madrid, his defence could not hold out in Bulgaria and failed to produce when it mattered.

Liverpool have reached their lowest ebb. The problem for Rodgers, though, is it could yet get worse.
