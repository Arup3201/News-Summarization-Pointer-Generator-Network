Future peace negotiations in Pakistan are now in jeopardy after the Pakistani Taliban's deputy leader Waliur Rehman was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Wednesday.

Rehman was considered the best chance for talks with the incoming Pakistani government over his more hardline superior, Hakeemullah Mehsud, who remains at large.

The Pakistani Taliban withdrew their offer of peace talks today, a group spokesman said.

It is also widely believed that the Islamic militant movement has selected a replacement for Rehman.

Killed: Wali-ur-Rehman, deputy commander of the Tehreek-e-Taliban, was allegedly one of seven people killed in a US drone attack in the North Waziristan region

Taliban spokesman Ahsanullah Ahsan 
said the group is discussing whether Khan Sayed, Rehman's deputy, will 
succeed him as head of the militant group's most powerful branch in 
South Waziristan, which would effectively make him the 
second-in-command.

Two Taliban commanders said commanders voted in favor of Sayed at a meeting, but Ahsan said a vote had yet to be taken.

Rehman was killed yesterday when drone-fired missiles landed on a house on the outskirts of Miran Shah, the main town in the North Waziristan tribal region.

Four other people were killed, according to Pakistani intelligence officials.

Two militants also confirmed that they had attended his funeral on Wednesday night but spoke on condition of anonymity. Journalists have little access to the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan, making independent confirmation of his death difficult.

Sayed is believed to be about 40 years old and is known mainly for coordinating attacks in Afghanistan, say intelligence and militant sources.

He was responsible for organizing an assault on a prison in northwestern Pakistan in April 2012 in which close to 400 prisoners, including 20 who were considered dangerous insurgents, were freed.

Ahsan also told The Associated Press in a telephone call from an undisclosed location that the militants withdrew an offer to join peace talks because they believe the Pakistani government approves of the U.S. drone strikes, despite official statements to the contrary. He also formally confirmed that Rehman had been killed.

Willing to talk: Wali-ur-Rehman, centre, was poised to take over leadership of the Tehreek-e-Taliban

Controversial: Drone attacks like the one that killed Waliur Rehman are a highly contentious method of tackling the Taliban and other militants

'We had made the offer for peace 
talks with the government with good intention but we think that these 
drone attacks are carried out with the approval of the government so we 
announce the end of the talks process,' he said.

Three of the others killed were 
mid-level Pakistani aides to Rehman, two Pakistani intelligence 
officials said, also speaking on condition they not be identified 
because they were not authorized to release the information. They said 
they are still trying to confirm the nationality and identity of the 
fifth militant.

White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to confirm Wednesday if Rehman was dead.

However, he said if true, Rehman's 
death would deprive the militant group of its chief military strategist,
a man the U.S. says was involved in an attack that killed seven CIA 
employees in Afghanistan. In 2010, Washington offered $5million for information leading to Rehman.

Pakistan's incoming prime minister, 
Nawaz Sharif, had said that he was ready to negotiate with the Pakistani
Taliban but Rehman's death has now deprived the process of a key 
player.

Sharif earlier this month criticised the U.S.'s drone strikes as a ‘challenge’ to Pakistan's sovereignty.

This
drone attack is the first since the country’s general election on May 
11 where the U.S.’s use of the unmanned aircrafts was one of the most 
debated issues.

It followed President Barack Obama's speech last Thursday during which he pledged more restrictive rules on the use of drones.

The Pakistani Taliban has been battling government forces for years in a bid to push them from the tribal regions, cut Pakistan's ties with the U.S. and eventually establish their brand of hardline Islam across Pakistan.

North Waziristan is on the Afghan border
and has long been a stronghold of militants including Afghan Taliban 
and their Al-Qaeda allies.
