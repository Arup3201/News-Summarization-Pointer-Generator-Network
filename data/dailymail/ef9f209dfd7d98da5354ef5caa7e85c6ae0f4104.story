A New York police officer captured on a smartphone video punching a teenage suspect during an arrest has been suspended.

New York Police Department officials announced the suspension on Friday but didn't name the officer.

The arrest occurred last Monday after police were responding to a report of an assault in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.

'Punch': Footage appears to show the man punching the boy as officers move to let him into the circle

The video shows several uniformed officers struggling to handcuff a 16-year-old boy before a plainclothes officer rushes in and throws two punches.

A woman can be heard yelling at the officers to stop what they're doing.

Another woman says she can't believe what she's seeing after 'everything that's happened,' an apparent reference to the chokehold death of Eric Garner. 

Garner, a black man, died after a white officer applied an alleged chokehold while arresting him for selling un-taxed cigarettes during the summer. When a grand jury opted not to indict the officer last month, thousands took to the streets of New York City in protest. 

In the video taken last Monday, the teen appeared to be resisting officers who were attempting to handcuff him.

Suddenly, a plain-clothes cop ran up from behind and punched the teen several times in the side.

Screams: Witnesses screamed at the man to stop as the 16-year-old boy lost his footing

Witnesses filming the attack screamed at the man to stop.

'Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop it! Get off of him!' one woman yells at the officers. 

One woman shouts that the suspect is just 12 years old. She identifies herself as a lawyer and says: 'I can't believe he just did that after everything that's happened.' 

'Get a different profession, this is not a war. Go to war, the woman jeers.'   

Actress Sarah Doneghy, who caught the incident on her phone camera, said on YouTube: 'This happened today on my way to the post office.

'The kids were 12. They had supposedly pushed one of their classmates down. 

'However when the victim was asked, he said those weren't the guys.'

'They were still taken away,' Doneghy added. '12. Years. Old.'

The NYPD later confirmed the suspect was 16 years old. 

Officers said the teen has a history of arrests. He and two others were arrested for assaulting someone who walked with a cane.
