A bullet was fired through the windshield after a gunman opened fire at a Florida high school on Friday night 

Local 6 reported that the 19-year-old suffered injuries to her neck from glass shards. She did not want to reveal her identity for fear of reprisals. 

The school was immediately placed on lock down following the gun fire.  

Police found a white car that they believed to hold a shooting suspect. One person was held by police out of the four traveling in the vehicle at the time. 

However no suspects were taken into custody and the shooter remains at large.  

Several parents told Local 6 that their children were afraid to go to school following the apparent random shooting.  

A basketball game has been scheduled at Vanguard High on Tuesday against Lake Minneola High School. 

Daily Mail Online had reached out to Marion County Public Schools to see if the game would go ahead tonight but had received no response at the time of publication. 

The police investigation is ongoing.
