Urban Outfitters has once again angered consumers with one of its designs, this time with a tapestry that closely resembles a Nazi concentration camp uniform forced upon male gay prisoners during the Holocaust. 

Anti-Defamation League, an organization dedicated to fighting antisemitism, issued a statement yesterday calling for Urban Outfitters to stop selling the tapestry; which is not listed on the retailer's website, but was photographed at a store in Boulder, Colorado.

'Whether intentional or not, this gray and white stripped pattern and pink triangle combination is deeply offensive and should not be mainstreamed into popular culture,' said Abraham H. Foxman, ADL's national director and a Holocaust survivor.

Mr Foxman stated: 'We urge Urban Outfitters to immediately remove the product eerily reminiscent of clothing forced upon the victims of the Holocaust from their stores and online.'

Between 1933 and 1945 the Nazis arrested up to 100,000 gay men and the death rate for homosexual prisoners in the camps was said to be 50per cent.

The tapestry in question does not currently appear on Urban Outfitters' website, but a store clerk from its Boulder store told The Daily Dot she 'recalled seeing it sold in the last few months' but added it was no longer available.

Urban Outfitters' other tapestry designs retail for between $39 and $69, and are described as being 'the perfect piece for topping off your bed, wall, or favorite chair', or used as a 'beach or picnic blanket'.

A representative from the clothing giant is yet to respond to Daily Mail Online's request for comment.

Not the first time: In 2012, ADL took offence to a $100 yellow T-shirt sold by Urban Outfitters (left) which it deemed too similar to the yellow Star of David worn by Jewish people in Nazi Germany (right)

Well-trodden path: In 2003, ADL targeted Urban Outfitters once again over a T-shirt with a message reading, 'Everyone loves a Jewish girl', surrounded by dollar signs (pictured)

It's not the first time ADL has criticized designs sold by Urban Outfitters.

In 2012, it took offence to a $100 yellow T-shirt with a blue six-pointed star etched over the chest; imagery ADL deemed uncomfortably close to the yellow Star of David worn by Jewish people in Nazi Germany.

'We find this use of symbolism to be extremely distasteful and offensive, and we are outraged that your company would make this product available to your customers,' wrote Barry Morrison, Philadelphia regional director of the organisation.

The T-shirt was subsequently recalled and its designer Wood Wood responded by saying the design was 'in no way a reference to Judaism, Nazism, or the Holocaust.'

More controversy: In 2011, the retailer sold a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase 'Eat Less' (right) and last year, a T-shirt which read 'Depression' (left) - both drew criticism for glamorizing mental illness

Insensitive: Last year, it recalled what appeared to be a blood-spattered 'Kent State' sweatshirt (pictured), which many interpreted as a reference to the 1970s Kent State massacre

And in 2003,  ADL targeted Urban Outfitters once again over a T-shirt with a message reading, 'Everyone loves a Jewish girl', surrounded by dollar signs.

Other more recent controversies include the retailer selling what appeared to be a blood-spattered 'Kent State' sweatshirt last year, which many interpreted as a reference to the 1970s Kent State massacre, although Urban Outfitters denied any previous knowledge of the crime.

In 2011, it sold a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase 'Eat Less', which was recalled after critics lambasted Urban Outfitters for glamorizing eating disorders.

Similarly, last January, the retailer was forced to stop selling a T-shirt stamped with the phrase 'depression', after critics complained that it trivialized mental illness.
