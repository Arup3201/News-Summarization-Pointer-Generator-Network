Roy Keane and Kevin Pietersen stole the show on Monday as a number of stunning revelations were released from their respective must-read autobiographies.

In response, Sportsmail's top team of reporters have had a look at their bookcases and picked out some of their favourite sports reads of all time.

ROB DRAPER

A Life Too Short: The Tragedy of Robert Enke (Ronald Reng) 

A Life Too Short is both a desperate tragedy and the most extraordinary piece of writing. It will also act as an antidote to the froth, nonsense and self importance of Kevin Pietersen. Early indications are that Pietersen has confused settling scores in what amounts to a playground argument as a substantial issue. A Life Too Short chronicles German international goalkeeper Robert Enke's battle with mental illness and his eventual suicide. Friend and journalist Ronnie Reng was allowed access to his private diaries to complete the work. I doubt there has ever been a sports book as moving or profound.

JOE BERNSTEIN

This One's On Me (Jimmy Greaves)  

Twenty-four years before England's greatest striker released a second glossy autobiography Greavsie, he co-wrote a book that charted his life and career, from sporting icon to helpless alcoholic, with quite remarkable frankness and absence of self-pity.

Greaves was between a glittering footballer career and becoming a genuine television star as one half of Saint & Greavsie at the time of publication of This One's On Me in 1979. It was an eye-opener for any fan who wanted to know what it was really like to be top-class player.

He wrote about being a golden boy with Chelsea and Spurs, life as an early football expat in Italy, being frozen out of the World Cup final and his friendship with Bobby Moore. And the alcoholism that nearly killed him. Unlike George Best or Paul Gascogine, he refused to blame stardom or the media for his problems, which makes the book all the more fascinating.

Jimmy Greaves' first autobiography is a remarkably frank piece into the life of a top-class footballer

MIKE DICKSON

The Miracle of Castel Di Sangro (Joe McGinniss) 

Like most good sports books The Miracle of Castel Di Sangro provides essential truths far beyond the pure subject matter. In this case it is about a small town football team from an unfashionable part of Italy and their unlikely rise to Serie B. The characters are richly portrayed and it takes you into a part of the world, sporting and geographically, that is rarely touched. Author Joe McGinniss, who died last year, also got lucky in that unexpected events only add to an already extraordinary tale. A very fine book that avoids so many of the usual football clichés.

LAURIE WHITWELL

I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Zlatan Ibrahimovic)  

Coruscating from the very first words on his fallout with Pep Guardiola, this is a book that burrows into the veins of the football industry as much as life growing up in an immigrant family. Frank, funny, and fascinating to the last, his voice projects from the page and even his agent Mino Raiola is not spared from killer put downs. A real insight into one of the best minds to take to a pitch.

CRAIG HOPE

Behind the Curtain: Travels in Eastern European Football (Jonathan Wilson) 

This is probably the only book I still pick up and reread the occasional chapter. Part history lesson, part travelogue, the subject – previously unchartered territory to my knowledge – and its characters are fascinating, some triumphant, many more tragic. I’ve always been intrigued by football in Eastern Europe, probably because of Red Star’s European Cup win in 1991, and this book feeds that hunger with a brilliant collection of anecdotes. I recently re-read the chapter on Croatia and the fall of Yugoslavia when travelling through the country with the voice of Slaven Bilic depicting the horror of war and subsequent rise of their football team. It’s witty, entertaining and informative. Just a very good read.

MARK ALFORD

Unusual for me that my favourite two football books centre on a man who failed so abjectly as manager of super Leeds United.

Provided You Don't Kiss Me: 20 Years with Brian Clough (Duncan Hamilton) 

Duncan Hamilton’s glorious account working with Brian Clough every single day for two decades. Hamilton was the Nottingham Post’s football correspondent. Hamilton – hands down – had the best and most difficult job in football journalism at the time. Imagine being told one day: ‘You’re f***ing banned forever from this ground. F***ing forever.’ Only for two days later to have Clough on the blower purring: ‘Get you’re a*** down here. I didn't mean it. Spur of the moment thing. Gone and forgotten now. Come down and we'll have a drink. I've got a story for you. Fancy a glass of champagne?’

Duncan Hamilton’s provides a glorious account of working with Brian Clough for 20 years

The Damned Utd (David Peace) 

David Peace’s Damned United – about Clough’s doomed 44-day tenure following the Don at Elland Road - is hauntingly dark and brilliantly researched. But where Hamilton’s account stands as a journalistic triumph, Peace is a glorious work of fiction that you so hope to be true. It made for quite a film, which you imagine Provided You Don’t Kiss Me would as well.

Special mentions, too, for Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream (HG Bissinger’s account following a Texan high school’s American Football team, which inspired the Emmy-award-winning NBC TV series), David Storey’s This Sporting Life (a classic – for anyone daft enough to not appreciate rugby league) and, finally, Hoggy: Welcome To My World (Matthew Hoggard is ‘as mad as a box of frogs,’ according to Freddie Flintoff. Quite).

JACK GAUGHAN

Forza Italia: The Fall and Rise of Italian Football (Paddy Agnew)

The perfect mix of Italian life and its captivating football culture from the mid-80s, nobody is better placed to tell the inside story of Serie A’s various scandals – and how they were reported – than Agnew. He was in the Mediterranean for over two decades, at the heart of Diego Maradona’s rise at Napoli and the serious match-fixing problems.

While Italy has changed immeasurably as a country since Agnew moved over there, the way in which he tells a footballing story paralleled with the state of the country at the time is fascinating.

Read in three days on holiday. So too was Soccernomics (by Simon Kuper), although I’m not sure Albufeira was particularly ready for that.

ADAM SHERGOLD

All Played Out: The Full Story of Italia '90 (Pete Davies)

This all-encompassing account of England at the 1990 World Cup in Italy remains gripping even though we all know how the story turns out. Davies skilfully weaves together a narrative embracing the players, management, fans and opposition and makes it detailed but not at any point dull and simultaneously heart-warming and heart-breaking. The author was blessed with an incredible tale to work with of course - Gazza's tears, penalty pain - but the way in which Davies pulls it all together makes this a must-read. He also enjoyed access to his subjects in a way that will never now be repeated and they were all, to a man, open and honest with him.

LUKE AUGUSTUS

Barca: The Making of the Greatest Team in the World (Graham Hunter)

A club that reinvented football, and laid down the foundations of Spain's international dominance between 2008-2012, this book provides a brilliant insight into the structure of Barcelona.

Graham Hunter beautifully delves into the club's past from the successful Johan Cruyff's 'Dream Team' of the late 1980's and early 1990's and how that all conquering side moulded and defined the club's future from its academy to the first team which saw Pep Guardiola lead Lionel Messi and Co to 14 trophies in four mesmeric seasons.

Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography provides an insight to his 26 years as Manchester United manager

Alex Ferguson My Autobiography (Alex Ferguson) 

Britain's most decorated manager led Manchester United to a period of dominance that English football had never seen before, yet he kept his guard well and truly up when it came to providing any insights into his secrets of success.

Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography finally lifts the lid on his 26 years in charge of the Old Trafford hotseat. From his feuds with Roy Keane, David Beckham and Wayne Rooney to his formulae of winning 38 trophies - this book has it all.

JONNY SINGER

A Season With Verona (Tim Parks) 

An English writer spends a season travelling around with a newly promoted Italian team, for their season in Serie A. From life on board the team plane to shockingly racist Ultras, this is a stark and revealing insight into Italian football.

Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics (Jonathan Wilson) 

While autobiographies give you a snapshot of the game at any one moment, a book like this is on a different scale. A tactical odyssey, explaining where it all started, and how we got where we are today, from the days when teams lined up with seven forwards to the current trend of playing one up front. The best history of football you’ll read.

SEAN GALLAGHER

Craig Bellamy: GoodFella (Craig Bellamy and Oliver Holt) 

A misunderstood and controversial figure, this book highlights the true Craig Bellamy. It reveals how especially during his young years as a footballer of his tormented and dark days and how he struggled to cope with life after the tragic death of close friend Gary Speed. Despite all his on and off field problems no one can deny Bellamy’s passion for the game and this book underlines just this.

Blessed - The Autobiography (George Best) 

Unlike other autobiographies you read this one really gets to grip with Best challenging his demons and his future from there on. It is refreshingly open and honest, and particularly poignant, as Best talks about his alcohol problems from the off, his string of female friends, and undisputed success with Manchester United. From a young boy in Belfast to a global super star, this book is one which can’t be missed.
