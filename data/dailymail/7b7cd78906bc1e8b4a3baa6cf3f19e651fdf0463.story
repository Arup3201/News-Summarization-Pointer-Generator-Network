More than 11,000 foreign students have been barred from entering Britain after their college courses were exposed as ‘bogus’, it emerged last night.

The Home Office said one in every five colleges - more than 450 in total - offering places to overseas students has lost its licence after a crackdown on the rampant abuse of the visa system.

The colleges have been banned from bringing any non-EU students into the UK.

The colleges, which either failed to sign-up to a new Home Office inspection system or had their licences revoked, could have brought more than 11,000 international students into the UK each year.

Some could not produce any records of student attendance, others failed to show they checked student qualifications and another could not even produce a list of students enrolled or a timetable of classes.

Immigration minister Damian Green said widespread abuse of the student visa system - the most common way for migrants from outside the EU to get into the UK - had gone on for too long.

Under Labour, ministers admitted it was the ‘Achilles’ heel’ of the immigration system, but critics say they did little to tighten the rules.

It was blamed for allowing terror suspects a backdoor into the UK.

Some colleges were nothing more than rooms above fast-food shops or other commercial premises.

Earlier this year, the government introduced new rules making it far harder for colleges which do not offer degrees to be allowed to sponsor visas.

Students are now also required to speak a reasonable level of English.

Mr Green said: ‘Too many institutions were offering international students an immigration service rather than an education and too many students have come to the UK with the aim of getting work and bringing over family members.

‘Only first-class education providers should be given licences to sponsor international students. We have curbed the opportunities to work during study and bring in family members.

‘We have also introduced new language requirements to ensure we only attract genuine students whose primary motivation is to study.’ 

More than 400 colleges lost their right to recruit international students after they failed to sign up for the new inspection system, the Home Office said.

In addition, a sharp spike in student visa applications from south Asia just before the English language requirement rules were tightened prompted an investigation into 119 colleges.

Of these, a further 51 had their licences revoked, three had licences suspended and nine were re-rated.

A total of 11 are subject to further considerations and 45 were found to be compliant.

The move comes after the Government announced a blacklist of more than 2,500 banks which cannot be trusted to verify documents supporting student visa applications.

Foreign students applying to study in the UK who claim they have funds to support themselves and pay for their course held in any of the banks on the list will receive no points for maintenance.

The list includes 1,977 banks in India, three in Pakistan and 762 in the Philippines.

Ministers consider it vital to get a grip on student visas if they are to have any chance of reducing net migration – the difference between the number of people entering the country, and those leaving – to the ‘tens of thousands’.

Students represent almost two-thirds of the migrants coming to the UK from outside the EU each year.

In the 12 months to the end of June, a total of 304,548 student visas were issued, including 33,342 dependants, along with 36,018 student visa extensions, which included 19,416 dependants, Home Office figures showed.
