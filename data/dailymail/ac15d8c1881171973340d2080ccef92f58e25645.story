The U.S.-led coalition has struck targets of the Islamic State group near a besieged Kurdish town in Syria near the border with Turkey, activists said.

It is not clear if the airstrikes halted the militants' advance on Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab.

The town currently hosts thousands of Syrian refugees fleeing ISIS' murderous advance. More than a million have flooded over the border into neighbouring Turkey.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit Islamic State fighters east and west of Kobani. The Local Co-ordination Committees, another activist group, confirmed the air strikes on the town's outskirts.

Kobani has been under attack by IS since mid-September. Despite US-led air strikes, the militants were able to advance towards the town over the past few days.

The Observatory said fighting around Kobani yesterday killed 57 fighters on both sides - the town's Kurdish defenders and ISIS militants.

In the last week alone, more than 150,000 Kurdish men, women and children have crossed into Sanlinurfa, Turkey, to escape the Islamic State fighters laying siege to Kobani.

Turkey had taken in well over a million Syrian refugees from the three-and-a-half year-old conflict already before the latest wave, but this influx is the largest yet, according to the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR.

In the last week alone, more than 150,000 Kurdish men, women and children have crossed into Sanlinurfa, Turkey, to escape the Islamic State fighters laying siege to Kobani. 

Turkey is likely to gain parliamentary approval for cross-border military operations in Syria and Iraq this week as Islamic State insurgents threaten its territory, but will be hesitant to send in troops without an internationally-enforced no-fly zone.

The Islamic State advance to within clear sight of the Turkish army has piled pressure on Ankara to take a more robust stance against the militants as part of the U.S.-led coalition carrying out air strikes in Iraq and Syria.

Turkey, a NATO member with long borders with both countries, has so far declined to take a frontline role, fearful partly that the military action will strengthen Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and bolster Kurdish militants allied to Kurds in Turkey who have fought for three decades for greater autonomy.

Meanwhile, Iraqi Kurdish forces captured a strategic border crossing and several villages from Islamic State fighters in northern Iraq on Tuesday, scoring gains as the militants were pounded by heavy U.S.-led air strikes and the Iraqi army advanced from the south.

An Iraqi Kurdish political source said Kurdish peshmerga fighters took control of the Rabia border crossing with Syria in a battle that began before dawn.

Anger: Turkey, already home to an estimated 1.5 million refugees from Syria's civil war, is pushing the United States and its allies to create a safe haven for refugees inside Syrian territory

Several hundred thousand refugees are reportedly still in Kobani and aid agencies are bracing for a massive exodus into Turkey

Twelve Islamic State fighters' bodies lay on the border at the crossing after the battle, said Hemin Hawrami head of the Kurdish Democratic Party's foreign relations department, on Twitter.

The ability to cross the frontier freely has been a major tactical advantage for Islamic State fighters on both sides.

Fighters swept from Syria into northern Iraq in June and returned with heavy weapons seized from fleeing Iraqi government troops, which they have used to expand their territory in Syria.

U.S.-led forces have been bombing Islamic State targets in Iraq since August and expanded the campaign to Syria last week in an effort to defeat the fighters who have swept through Sunni areas of both countries, killing prisoners, chasing out Kurds and ordering Shi'ites and non-Muslims to convert or die.
