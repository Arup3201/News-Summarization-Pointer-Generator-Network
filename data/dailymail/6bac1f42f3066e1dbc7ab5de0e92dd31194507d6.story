Emmanuel Riviere is hoping Newcastle can help him force his way into the France squad.

The 24-year-old striker, who completed his move to St James' Park on Wednesday, has represented his country at Under-21 level, but is determined to follow new club-mates Moussa Sissoko and Remy Cabella into Didier Deschamps' senior squad.

Riviere told nufcTV: 'For that too, I signed here. I want to get into the France team.

'I want to adapt quickly to the Premier League because the Premier League is not Ligue 1. Ligue 1 is different.

'I want to work hard to adapt fast to the Premier League and play at Newcastle.'

Riviere has been drafted in to plug a sizeable gap left by the departures of loan signings Loic Remy and Luuk de Jong and the out-of-contract Shola Ameobi, and he admits he had no hesitation in accepting Alan Pardew's offer of employment.

He said: 'When Newcastle phoned me, I said yes directly because Newcastle is a big club with many fans, with a big manager. I said yes directly.

'It was an easy decision, I made my choice quickly. When I was told Newcastle, I said yes directly.'

In an ideal world, Riviere would have spoken to former Toulouse team-mate Sissoko before making his decision, but the midfielder was otherwise occupied at the time.

Riviere said: 'No, I didn't speak to him because he was at the World Cup and I didn't want to disturb him because he was concentrating on that.

'But I asked people about Newcastle and everybody told me it's a good club.'

Riviere, who will be among the Magpies party which jets out to New Zealand for a week-long trip this weekend, arrived in England hoping to follow in the footsteps of his footballing hero, but knowing he has work to do to adapt to a different game.

He said: 'My hero is Thierry Henry. Thierry Henry is my idol because he is from the French West Indies - me too. He's my hero.

'I am a striker, fast, strong and I score goals. I think my characteristics are good for the Premier League.'
