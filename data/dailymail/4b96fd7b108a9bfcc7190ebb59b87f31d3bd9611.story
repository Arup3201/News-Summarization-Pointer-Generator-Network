When Arsenal signed Danny Welbeck on transfer deadline day it was seen by many as a decent stop-gap until Olivier Giroud returns from injury.

The French striker will be back come the New Year and Arsene Wenger was in desperate need of cover. But in the long run, with Theo Walcott soon to return to action, Welbeck's arrival could mean a significant change of style for Arsenal.

A front three of the former Manchester United forward, Walcott and summer signing Alexis Sanchez is on the cards. And it could be the quickest front three in the Premier League.

On the mend: Theo Walcott could be part of a frightening front three when he returns from injury

Options: Arsenal's probable line-up?

In truth Wenger now has a wealth of attacking options. Welbeck joins Walcott, Sanchez, Yaya Sanogo, Joel Campbell and Lukas Podolski as men who can lead the line.

And behind that there is even more choice. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Santi Cazorla, Mesut Ozil, Tomas Rosicky, Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey provide a wealth of possibility at the Emirates Stadium.

A probable forward line, with all players available, of Welbeck, Walcott and Sanchez will mean a move away from that measured style for Wenger.

Of course, the passing football will remain in tact, but the slow build-up and lack of penetration should be long gone. Arsenal badly missed Walcott after his injury in January, without any players running in behind Giroud.

Wenger has tinkered with a 4-5-1 formation this season to get the best out of Ramsey and Wilshere, though the 4-3-3 will best suit this team.

A flavour of Arsenal's 2003/04 counter attack could be back on the cards, with Ozil able to thread through balls through to the raft of speedsters. 

'I believe the style of play the manager's got and the boys play and with the magnificent players in midfield slotting balls through, I can run on to the end of those balls and slot them away,' Welbeck said upon arriving at the club.

Bench life: Welbeck will be given more chance to impress in his favourite central role at Arsenal

Time to create: Mesut Ozil will have plenty of runners to thread through this season in the Premier League

Often played on the wing and out of the goals at United and for England, the 23-year-old now has his chance. And with the players around him, there should be no excuse.

Welbeck's speed and power coupled with Sanchez and Walcott is a mouth-watering prospect, so watch out Premier League.
