Pippa Middleton and four-time Olympic gold medal champion Sir Ben Ainslie set sail together today from Lymington on the south coast, travelling to the Isle of Wight. 

In spite of the blustery, icy weather, Pippa was all smiles, laughing and joking with the group on the JP Morgan-branded launch, which took the party to a yacht between the island and the mainland.

The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister wrapped up in sensible, padded navy waterproof trousers with matching anorak - with high-visibility hood to finish the whole look off.

Pippa enjoyed a day on the open water today - with her windswept hair and sensible anorak, she looked very different from her normal glamorous self

Pippa Middleton was seen sailing in the English Channel between Lymington and Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight with Olympic yachtsman Sir Ben Ainslie and a group of companions

The blustery weather has the wind whipping Pippa's hair across her face, while her female companion makes sure she holds on to the launch firmly

The day started off sunny this morning on the south coast, but soon turned grey and windy - not that this put any of the outdoorsy the group off, all appeared in high spirits throughout

The look is a far cry from her normal glamorous, polished self. But rosy cheeks and windswept hair rather suited her.

Once on board the yacht, Pippa even took the wheel for a spell, looking confident as she handled the craft.

The party spent from 10.30am until 2.30pm on the open water, before breaking for lunch at the George Hotel & Restaurant in Yarmouth, where a small group of fans had gathered to await Pippa and Ben's arrival.

Her companion for the day, Sir Ben 
Ainslie, is Britain's most successful ever Olympian, having won four 
gold medals in his career. He has also won eleven World Championships 
and nine European Championships.

The sailing legend was the special guest at a school assembly earlier in the day.Delighted pupils at Ferndown First School in Dorset welcomed the most successful yachtsman in history.

Sir
 Ben named its first-ever Andrew Simpson Sports Ambassadors, an 
initiative in memory of Dorset’s gold medal sailor Andrew, who was 
killed in a training accident in San Francisco Bay earlier this year.

The party speed towards the yacht - the entire Middleton family are keen sailors, so Pippa must feel quite at home on the sea

Ahoy there! Her rosy cheeks and windswept hair rather suited the adventurous aunt of the future king

After hours spent at sea, Pippa looked fresh-faced and rosy-cheeked as she hit dry land again - and certainly had a spring in her step
