It is a beach litter cleanup even the kids could enjoy.

Lego is continuing to wash up on the shores of Cornwall beaches 17 years after a container ship was struck by a freak wave and close to five million pieces were lost overboard.

The Tokio Express was en-route from Rotterdam to New York on February 13, 1997, when a wild wave struck it 20 miles west of Land's End, tilting it back and forth at such a sharp degree it lost 62 containers.

A collection of the tiny bits and pieces found scattered along the coast. There were almost five million pieces of Lego inside the container when it was lost overboard in the 1997 accident

Many of the Lego items that were lost overboard in the freak storm were sea-themed and some of the pieces most commonly found on local beaches are cutlasses, octopuses, scuba tanks and diving flippers

One of those lost containers held about five million pieces of Lego - a small and light enough object to be easily carried by ocean currents.

And in an odd coincidence, a large proportion of the Lego pieces were sea-themed, so cutlasses, octopuses, scubas and flippers have been routinely washing up on Cornish beaches ever since.

The ship's manifest revealed 4,756,940 pieces fell into the sea including 3,178,807 light enough to float. However, nobody has ever established what happened to the remaining containers.

Spear guns (red and yellow) - 13,000

Black octopus - 4,200

Yellow life preserver - 26,600

Diver flippers (in pairs, black, blue, red) - 418,000

Dragons (black and green) - 33,941

Brown ship rigging net - 26,400

Daisy flowers (in fours - white, red, yellow) - 353,264

Scuba and breathing apparatus (grey) - 97,500

Tracey Williams, from Newquay, said: 'There's stories of kids in the late 1990s having buckets of dragons on the beach, selling them.

'These days the holy grail is an octopus or a dragon. I only know of three octopuses being found, and one was by me, in a cave in Challaborough.

'It's quite competitive. If you heard that your neighbour had found a green dragon, you'd want to go out and find one yourself.'

US oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer has tracked the story of the Lego since it was spilled.

He says reports of it reaching as far as Australia are not too far fetched as theoretically it could have reached any beach in the world by now.

He said: 'The mystery is where they've ended up. After 17 years they've only been definitely reported off the coast of Cornwall.

'The most profound lesson I've learned from the Lego story is that things that go to the bottom of the sea don't always stay there.'

Dragons have become a rare find on the beaches nowadays, and as a result are highly sought after by locals

Finding an octopus on the beaches of Cornwall is now considered the 'holy grail' for local Lego hunters, who have spent years in the area searching for the tiny bits of plastic lost overboard in 1997

An environmental campaigners say the legacy of the lost Lego illustrates how marine waste and litter floats around for years, posing a risk to wildlife and polluting our seas.

Latest figures show an average of 2,683 containers are lost at sea every year.

Martin Dorey, organiser of the 2 Minute Beach Clean group, which encourages people to pick up litter on beaches, said: 'I know it's not their fault, it's the way the ships are stacked.

'But while container spills are all resolved from the insurance point of view, it's not resolved from the marine point of view.'
