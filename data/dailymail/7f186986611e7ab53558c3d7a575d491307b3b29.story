Is this a sight Chelsea fans will see on a regular basis next season?

Cesc Fabregas has impressed during the Blues' pre-season to date and did so once more in Wednesday's 3-1 win at Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem.

The Spain 
international scored Chelsea's second with a sumptuous free-kick from 25 
yards after his compatriot Diego Costa was fouled just outside the box.

The goal was Fabregas' first since his £27million move from Barcelona in June.

The 27-year-old will be hoping for a similar performance when Chelsea travel to Werder Bremen on Saturday.
