ADRIAN DURHAM: The World Cup is by far the biggest stage of all, it’s Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard’s last chance to shine

ADRIAN DURHAM: Jack Colback is the most underrated player in the Premier League... Sunderland fans should thank him and move on

ADRIAN DURHAM: England must be adventurous and take the World Cup by storm or go out in glory... my starting XI for the opener with Italy

Is Roy Hodgson morphing into Fabio Capello? I sincerely hope not.

Two months ago I interviewed Roy, he was charming and knowledgeable and keen to listen to the views of me and other passionate England fans.

The consensus then was that none of us expected England to win the World Cup, but we would be happy to see us play with adventure.

Roy promised us he would be taking risks and not holding his players back: 'We will be brave and we will believe in ourselves and we will risk defeat.

'We won’t try and sneak our way through the games. With the type of players we’ve got that wouldn’t suit us.'

Passing it on? Hodgson will hope for a better World Cup than Capello (right) endured in South Africa in 2010

Steady: Hodgson is more than capable of playing it safe, as shown by England's draw in Ukraine last year

He even talked about the Liverpool way. Well, for me, the Liverpool way means blowing teams away early on and putting on a show; and to do that you need exciting, dynamic, imaginative players.

The only two in the England squad who are available for the Italy game who have shown those qualities recently are Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling.

Be true to your word Roy – be brave, as you promised me you would be two months ago. Don’t just go with Lallana, put Barkley and Sterling in there as well, blow the Italians away early on. If you go for it, if you show adventure and take risks, you will be forgiven if it goes wrong.

The future: The talented Ross Barkley (left) must be allowed to shine in South America

If you’re cautious and fail – you will be judged a failure. We had to endure the pain of a gutless manager four years ago. Fabio Capello didn’t know his tactics, and he didn’t know his team.

Even worse, he lost control of his players mid-tournament. An astonishing display of terrible mismanagement, and he’s lucky to get a chance to show he can do it with Russia at this World Cup.

The England fans all know Sterling and Barkley should be in the team, and I suspect the England players know it too.

Wing wizard: Raheem Sterling must have a big part to play for England at the World Cup

But does Roy Hodgson know it?

I hope so, because if he tries to 'keep it tight' against Italy, and go for a draw because 'a draw is a good result', I suspect England will suffer. We have flaws at the back that decent sides can and will exploit.

The two recent friendlies prove my point: against Ecuador we played with adventure and it was great to watch. Against Honduras we were one-dimensional and functional. We drew both, but which gave England fans more satisfaction? The first of course.

If we are poor to watch, and go out in the group stage, Hodgson will prove himself to be a poor man’s Capello, a label that should strike fear into the England manager’s heart.

Be brave Roy. Deliver on your promise.

Will he keep his promise despite the tough group with Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica?

Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley must start against Italy in Manaus

If Hodgson plays defensively and fails, he will just be another Capello
