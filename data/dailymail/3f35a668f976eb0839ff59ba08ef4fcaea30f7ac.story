Its nickname from the locals suggests it would be better off in space rather than their quaint village.

And this huge glass eco-house dubbed 'Sputnik' certainly looks out of place in a beautiful picture-postcard area of Somerset - in the shadow of the local Grade I listed medieval church.

The dramatic circular property was approved by planners two years ago but is now being built in Batcombe, near Shepton Mallet, just yards away from the 15th century Church of St Mary the Virgin.

Residents said they had no idea it would be such a blot on the landscape but the final straw came when more than a dozen solar panels were installed at a 45 degree angle on the roof.

They have nicknamed the building after Sputnik - the world's first artificial satellite, which was launched by the USSR in October 1957 - because they say it resembles a landing space craft.

Ivan Ure, 91, who lives nearby said: ‘It's horrible - it looks like the back end of an old aircraft carrier and is totally out of keeping with our lovely village.

‘I never imagined it would be as bad as this when I first heard about it. It is ghastly. Every time I open my curtains in the morning to see it my soul sinks into my boots.

‘Batcombe is a lovely village with rosy red roofs and lovely homes. This is not a lovely home.’

Features: The home boasts an internal glass bridge, walled garden, walk-in wardrobes and a hanging fireplace

Neighbour Sandra Hamilton added: ‘The solar panels are at 45 degrees to the house. It really does look like a Sputnik landing, and spoils the view of the most beautiful Grade I listed church.’

The four-bedroom property is being built by Marc Waller, 54, who currently lives ten miles away in the town of Frome, Somerset. Mr Waller has not yet responded to a request for comment.

Mendip District Council approved the plans in January 2011, despite objections from residents. It boasts an internal glass bridge, walled garden, walk-in wardrobes and a hanging fireplace.

Batcombe Parish Council has received so many complaints about the building that the matter was due to be raised at the monthly village meeting tonight.

Local opinion will be fed back to planners, but Mendip Council has already ruled out taking action.

A spokesman said: ‘Planning enforcement have responded to complaints received from local residents and have been out to see the dwelling but concluded that no further action would be taken.'
