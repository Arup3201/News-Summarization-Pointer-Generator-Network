With only hours left to live, cancer patient and right-to-die activist Brittany Maynard took the time to reach out to a stranger whom she had come to view as a kindred spirit.

Maynard, the 29-year-old newlywed suffering from terminal brain cancer who has emerged as the face of the death-with-dignity movement, passed away peacefully at her Portland, Oregon, home November 1 after taking a lethal drug.

In the hours before she ended her life, Maynard sent an email to Barbara Mancini, a former nurse from Philadelphia, who had written to her in late October to express her support for her controversial decision.

Poster girl: Maynard, 29, has become the face of the death-with-dignity movement after going public with her decision to end her life on her own terms 

‘In the note, I told her I admired what she was doing. I felt it was selfless and courageous,’ Mancini told ABC News Thursday. ‘I never expected she would respond because it was late October and I knew she was having daily seizures and she was getting worse all the time.’

Maynard and Mancini never met in person, but the 29-year-old woman knew of her story, which made national headlines last year.

Barbara Mancini, a 58-year-old married mother of two, was arrested in 2013 for giving her terminally ill 93-year-old father a lethal dose of morphine to end his suffering.

After a drawn-out and costly legal battle that saw Mancini suspended from her job, she was cleared of all charges this past February, but her brush with the law over assisted suicide has left an indelible impression on her.

In her email written shortly before drawing her last breath, Maynard wrote to Manicni telling her she was familiar with her ordeal and encouraging her to continue fighting for the right to die with dignity.

'I am so sorry you had to endure that,' she wrote, according to People Magazine. 'It was clear to me, in my heart, that you were doing your very best to care for your terminally ailing father.

'That is a difficult job. As a terminally ill person myself, I understand what the level of sacrifice means for a loving and supportive family on an emotional, physical and financial level.

Mancini's supporters said the state of Pennsylvania was imposing itself in Joseph Yourshaw's desire to end his own life after suffering numerous health complications  

‘Stories like yours and mine put human faces on a controversial topic that many politicians are happy to sweep under the rug,’ Maynard wrote. ‘I wish I could have had the pleasure of meeting you in person.’

Mrs Manicni said she was 'deeply touched' by the dying woman's last note and vowed to carry on her legacy.

‘I truly believe it's the right thing to allow dying people who are mentally competent have a choice in how their life ends,’ she said.

Late last month, Mancini quit her job as a nurse to become a spokesperson for Compassion & Choices advocating for more death with dignity laws. 

Brittany Maynard went public with her decision to end her life to raise funds through the organization Compassion & Choices to advocate for assisted suicide as an option for terminally ill patients. She was featured on the cover of People magazine last month. 

Gracious: With just hours left to live, Maynard, pictured here with her mother, wrote to Mancini telling her she was familiar with her story and encouraging her to continue advocating for the right to die 

Rest in peace: Maynard, a brain cancer victim, passed away November 1 after taking a lethal medication 

Maynard was diagnosed in January with a glioblastoma brain tumor and moved from her San Francisco Bay Area home to Oregon, one of five states that allow assisted suicides for terminally ill patients.

'Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. 

Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me … but would have taken so much more.

The world is a beautiful place, travel has been my greatest teacher, my close friends and folks are the greatest givers.

I even have a ring of support around my bed as I type … 

Goodbye world. Spread good energy. Pay it forward!'

Since 1997, more than 750 patients in Oregon have died from ingesting medications prescribed under the state's death with dignity law, according to the Oregon Public Health Division.

Barbara Mancini, then 57 years old, was charged in the summer of 2013 with giving a nearly full one-ounce bottle of morphine to her father, Joseph Yourshaw, at his Pottsville home in February 2013 for the purpose of helping him end his life. 

Yourshaw died at a hospital four days later after a hospice nurse called 911.

The 93-year-old man had a Do Not Resuscitate order and had made it clear he wanted to die after enduring excrutiating pain for two weeks.

In February, a Pennsylvania judge exonerated Mancini after ruling that the state Attorney General's Office failed to prove that the woman had committed a crime.

New calling: Mancini quit her job as a nurse last month to become an advocate with the right-to-die organization Compassion & Choices
