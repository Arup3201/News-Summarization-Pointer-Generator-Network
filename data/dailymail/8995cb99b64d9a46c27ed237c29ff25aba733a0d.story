Developers are exploiting planning reforms to inflict ‘inappropriate and unwanted’ housing on communities, a damning report has found.

The first official analysis of the Government’s shake-up two years ago warns that desirable areas have become a ‘battleground’ between councils and landowners.

In a report published today, MPs say the new rules are allowing housing to be ‘imposed on some communities’ by developers using legal loopholes to override local opposition.

The National Planning Policy Framework, introduced in March 2012, encouraged councils to earmark suitable land to meet demand for housing over the next five years.

Most contentiously, councils were also ordered to have a ‘presumption’ in favour of development, to meet the demand for housing from a growing population. 

But the Commons Communities and Local Government Committee warns that developers are exploiting this provision to secure prime greenfield land.

When council planners try to veto an application, developers are able to use the guidelines as a ‘stick with which to beat them’, the report says.

It concluded: ‘Our report has identified a number of issues with the operation of the NPPF: that it is not preventing unsustainable development; that it is leading to communities being subject to inappropriate and unwanted housing development; and that it is giving insufficient protection to England’s town centres.’

Campaigners have raised concerns about the new planning rules since they were brought in, saying they have led to a free-for-all for developers.

Former Tory minister Nick Herbert, the MP for Arundel and the South Downs, last year denounced the NFFP as an ‘environmental disaster’.

And earlier this year campaigners claimed that planning permission had been given on appeal for a staggering 27,000 houses on greenfield sites turned down by councils, in the last two years.

In today’s report ‘Operation of the NPPF’, the committee which reviewed 300 pieces of written evidence and interviewed 40 witnesses, agreed there were serious concerns about the reforms.

Parish councils said they felt ‘under siege’ and that permission was being given for homes with no thought to the impact on ‘local infrastructure such as schools, health care, transport and sewerage’.

Ministers were urged to close a loophole which allows developers to build on land which the council has not included in its ‘local plan’ – the area the local authority has designated for new homes.

The MPs heard that developers would reject the sites they had been offered, and then issue new planning applications to try to secure more desirable plots on the edges of towns and villages.

Committee chair Clive Betts, a Labour MP, said: ‘We heard developers were claiming sites were unviable in order to obtain planning permission on other, more lucrative sites against the wishes of the council and communities.’

The reasons they gave for the land being unviable could be ‘unreliable’ or in some cases the developers refused to reveal them due to ‘commercial confidentiality’, MPs were told.

The report said: ‘We are concerned that the question of viability of becoming a battleground between developers and local authorities.

‘There is a perception amongst councils that developers are using the NPPF provisions as a stick with which to beat them…and getting more greenfield sites added to the land supply’.

MPs said they had decided against ordering ministers to ‘tear up’ the planning guidance and start again but fundamental changes were needed to ‘ensure it does the job it was intended to do’.

Mr Betts suggested that when land for new housing is chosen ‘the same weight needs to be given to environmental and social factors as to the economic dimension’.

They also called for the government to scrap the rules which make it easier to turn former shops into homes as they are ‘making the town centre an unattractive place to visit or indeed to live’.
