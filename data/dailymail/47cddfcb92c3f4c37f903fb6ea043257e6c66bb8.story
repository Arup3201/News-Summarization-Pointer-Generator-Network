The FA are considering bidding to host the European Championships in 2028, which would be the first campaign to stage a major football tournament since the 2018 World Cup vote fiasco.

FA general secretary Alex Horne, who revealed the FA's ambition in Monaco on Thursday morning to dip their toes back in the murky bidding waters, has no fears that staging the climax to Euro 2020 would impact on England's chances.

The final and semi-finals of Euro 2020 are heading for Wembley with England overwhelming favourites to be allocated the showcase tournament games by UEFA in Geneva on September 18.

World champions Germany are the other contenders to host the finals being shared around 13 cities acrosss Europe - the initiative of UEFA President Michel Platini.

But Germany also have strong ambitions to host Euro 2024 and are still considering whether to pull out of 2020 final consideration in order to concentrate on their hosting blueprint for four years later leaving England in pole position.

Horne said: 'We're really confident with our bid. We know what the Germans have been saying. We know that they're thinking about 2024, but nothing has been confirmed. 

'I'm not going to dwell on their politics. I'm expecting that they're not going to push very hard for 2020. They've made it very clear they want 2024.'

And Horne added: 'I wouldn't rule out looking at Euro 2028 for a full tournament bid.'

German football chief Wolfgang Niersbach said: 'We still have the two options, to host the final rounds or four matches in the group stage. Our decision is open. We have a wonderful relationship with the England FA, but I am totally convinced that we will have both Wembley and Munich on the land map for Euro 2020.'

Scotland, especially after the feelgood factor from the Commonwealth Games, as well as Wales and Ireland are also hopeful of being allocated group matches.
