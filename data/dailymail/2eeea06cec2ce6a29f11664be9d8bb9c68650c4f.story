Doctors are confident they can save the legs of a British couple crushed by a drink-driver in Bruges.

Simon Huxtable, 44, and Deborah Dale, 34, were strolling through the picturesque Belgian city on New Year's Day when they were hit by a Mercedes being driven the wrong way along a one-way street, pinning them against the wall of a house.

Ms Dale, the most seriously injured of the two, remains in a medically induced coma in hospital.

Injured: Simon Huxtable, 44, and Deborah Dale, 34, were crushed by a car while on a romantic holiday in Bruges

The couple’s parents rushed to Belgium
after learning of the accident, and remain at their hospital bedsides. 
Foreign Office officials also are providing assistance.

Doctors treating the holidaymakers had feared they would be forced to amputate their legs, but Mr Huxtable appears to be recovering from his injuries and medics are optimistic that his partner will also escape losing her limbs.

Inspector Philippe Dankrey said: 'There is still a small percentage chance that they will have to amputate but it seems that they will be able to save their legs. It is very good news.'

The couple, from Witney, Oxfordshire, are both in intensive care at St Jan's hospital in Bruges. Family members are at their bedsides.

The pair had been staying at a hotel in the heart of the city when they set out for a morning walk on New Year's Day.

As they crossed the top of a T-junction at 10.30am local time, they were struck by the Mercedes.

The driver, who had been at a New Year's Eve party in the city centre, failed to stop at the junction and ploughed straight into the pair, pinning them against the wall of a house.

Police believe he was travelling at more than 30kph - the speed limit in that area.

Inspector Dankrey said: 'He drove a bit too fast and, as he had been drinking, he had too much alcohol in his blood.

'Then he hit the couple. They were squashed between the car and the front of the house.

'Neighbours heard the victims' screaming and came out of their houses to help.'

A 22-year-old was arrested for drink-driving and causing injuries to two people.

He was later released from custody and his driving licence revoked for two weeks.

The first pictures of the couple emerged yesterday.

Mr Huxtable, from Witney, Oxfordshire, had travelled to the historic Belgian city for a romantic New Year break with Miss Dale

'There was blood everywhere. The lady’s legs were completely crushed.’

Miss Dale’s ex-partner Kevin Ruxton branded the Belgian criminal justice system ‘disgusting’.

Mr Ruxton, a computer engineer from 
West London, said: ‘It’s up to a judge to decide if this drunk 
22-year-old gets any kind of sentence, I think that is preposterous. It 
seems too lenient.’

He added: ‘They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. We are still in shock.’

A spokesman for the Belgian 
police said the couple remained in a serious condition. ‘There is a 
possibility that they may both have to have either one or even both legs
amputated,’ he added.

Sister
Emmanuelle, a Catholic nun who witnessed the horrific scene, said: ‘I 
heard a big bang and then I heard loud screaming. There were two people 
lying on the ground screaming and waving their arms wildly. It was 
terrible.

‘The people were screaming and screaming and shouting out in English. I tried to reassure them but I cannot speak English.

‘The driver got out of the car and asked
someone to call an ambulance. People were coming out of their houses 
because of the noise

‘Finally the injured people fell silent and stopped screaming. After what seemed like a long time the police and the ambulance arrived.

Horrific: Witnesses to the crash said that they heard screaming while a retired doctor who lived nearby administered first aid

‘I have not been able to sleep since. I can still hear them screaming.'

A retired doctor, who lives next to the crash site, administered first aid on the couple while they waited for the ambulance.

Witness Marleen Broeckeart said: ‘There was blood everywhere. The lady’s legs were completely crushed.’

A police spokesman told the Daily Mail: ‘The driver is a local man. He had borrowed his sister’s car to come to Bruges for a New Year’s Eve party.

‘The next day he was driving the wrong way along a small street in the centre of Bruges.

‘He was meant to turn at a T-junction but he went straight on and drove into the British tourists who were walking along the footpath.

'The Mercedes is a very heavy car and it pinned them against the front of a house and they were badly hurt.

‘The driver said he had been drinking and officers found he was over the legal limit.

‘He was arrested and he was banned from driving for 15 days, which is the normal procedure. A magistrate will decide in the next couple of months if there will be any further charges.’

Popular: The historic city of Bruges attracts thousands of British tourists every year

Miss Dale’s parents, Roger and Diana, were at their daughter’s bedside at the Sint Jan Hospital in Bruges.

A hospital spokesman said: ‘They are very upset. They don’t want to talk about what has happened to their daughter. It is against hospital policy to discuss the medical condition of patients with journalists.’

Bruges, which dates from the 12th century and is a UNESCO world heritage site, is a popular holiday destination attracting tens of thousands of Britons every year.

The small Old Town is characterised by its winding cobbled streets, meandering canals and pretty squares surrounded by distinct Flemish red-brick houses.

However behind the picturesque architecture is a rich commercial history – Bruges was an important trading centre throughout the Middle Ages.
