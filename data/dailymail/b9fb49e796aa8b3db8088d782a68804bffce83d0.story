While Cristiano Ronaldo was the name on everyone's lips before kick-off, Thomas Muller was the real star of Germany v Portugal - showing his World Cup pedigree for the second tournament running with two first half goals.

But the Bayern Munich forward was also criticised for his theatrics which saw Pepe sent off, making his and Germany's task much easier in the Arena Fonte Nova.

The 24-year-old former Manchester United target coolly put his side in front after just 11 minutes, slotting a low penalty past Rui Patricio and scored Germany's third with a low left footed strike in first half stoppage time.

At the double: Muller tucked home his second goal just before half-time in Salvador's Arena Fonte Nova

His third came in 78th minute, tapping in Andre Schurrle's cross for the match-ball.

That trio went some way towards matching his 2010 Golden Boot-winning total of five goals in South Africa, after just one game.

But between the two first half goals, Muller made himself an enemy to the Portuguese for the wrong reasons - theatrically collapsing under Pepe's challenge and then drawing attention to the centre back's headbutt.

Muller now sits just one goal ahead of Arjen Robben, Robin van Persie, Karim Benzema and Neymar, who all scored twice in their respective openers.

The forward's third goal also put him half-way towards overhauling record-holder Ronaldo's 15 World Cup goals.

And while his dramatic fall and complaints about Pepe's headbutt won't have adhered him to Portugal fans, the 24-year-old is likely to be more concerned with his impressive goal tally.
