Prosecutors have agreed a secret plea deal with a babysitter who admitted killing a three-year-old child after the toddler refused to take off her coat. 

Iowa's Attorney General's Office and the Sioux County attorney agreed the deal with Rochelle Sapp, 34, of Orange City who killed Autumn Elgersma in October 2013. 

Judge Edward Jacobson agreed to a request by the attorney general to seal details of the plea agreement until Sapp is sentenced on Thursday.

Sapp was charged with the first-degree murder of the toddler after investigators discovered she slammed the three-year-old girl into the floor causing significant head injuries. Autumn died two days after the incident.

Sapp’s charged with first-degree murder in the October 2013 death of three-year-old Autumn Elgersma. Investigators say she slammed the toddler to the floor, causing head injuries that killed her days later.

The incident happened at Sapp's home in eastern Orange City where she ran a daycare centre. 

Sapp initially told police that Autumn had falled down some stairs and banged her head, but later admitted to throwing her against the ground after the little girl 'refused to take her coat off'.

Sapp rang Autumn's mother who came immediately and took the child to hospital.

The girl was airlifted to the Sanford Children's Hospital in Sioux Falls in North Dakota where doctors discovered the child suffered a fractured skull and brain trauma.

Sapp had initially been charged with Willful Injury and Child Endangerment Resulting in Serious Bodily Injury.

Sioux County Attorney Coleman McAllister said: 'In this case the initial charges were based on the medical evidence and opinion available to the state at that time.

'Upon Autumn's death, the circumstances changed.

'The medical examiner's office in Des Moines took time to make sure they did a thorough and complete examination and we like everybody else was waiting for them to render an opinion for us to evaluate so we could move forward with charges.'
