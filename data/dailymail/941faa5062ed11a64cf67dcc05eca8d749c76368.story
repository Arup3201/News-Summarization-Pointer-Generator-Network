Once, he was the epitome of decadence. A mischievous charmer  I last saw resplendent in a maroon crushed- velvet smoking jacket and Gucci slippers. Now, the self-styled ‘Lord’ Edward Davenport sits on the ‘wrong’ side of the table in a prison visiting hall, a uniformed guard behind him.

Davenport’s perma-tan has faded to a pallid grey. His hair and figure are thinner, the dancing blue eyes are now rheumy and bloodshot.

The socialite charm has been replaced by wariness – his gaze darts around the room  to point out murderers, armed robbers and rapists. His only thought is to survive one of Britain’s toughest jails unscathed.

'Fast Eddie': Edward Davenport pictured with his Thai girlfriend Monthira Sanan-Ua

The man who was one of London’s most colourful men-about-town is now known simply as Wandsworth prisoner number AA6697AB. Twelve months into an eight-year sentence for his part in a multi-million-pound fraud, 46-year-old Davenport says he deeply regrets causing so much pain to his mother and his girlfriend. But there appears to be little remorse for those who lost their homes and livelihoods.

In an exclusive interview inside the prison, Davenport accepts what he did was wrong but tells me he is planning an appeal against his conviction – and claims he is  a poor businessman rather than a crook. Those he stole from might think of him less charitably.

‘Yes, I did receive £773,000 as the courts say and I accept what  I did was wrong,’ he says. ‘But it  is such a waste of time and public money for me to be in here. It would have been far more beneficial for all concerned if I had been made to repay the money.’

For two decades, Davenport – the ‘Lord’ refers to a manorial title he bought – was a central  figure in London’s most hedonistic circles. In the late Eighties,  his black-tie ‘Gatecrasher Balls’ became notorious for the drunken debauchery of public school- educated teens before they were brought to an abrupt end when he was convicted of tax fraud.

Undeterred by spending nine days in Brixton Prison before his sentence was suspended, Davenport bought the Sierra Leone High Commission in Portland Place in 1999 for £50,000 while the country was embroiled in civil war. Today, it is said to be worth £30 million.

The magnificent historic house is familiar to millions as the set of the Oscar-winning film The King’s Speech. Davenport’s parties there proved hugely successful.

The most notorious events were sex parties where Viagra and  condoms were freely available. He admits he regularly participated in orgies.

‘Fast Eddie’ was soon a fixture in 
gossip columns, with homes in London and Monaco, a wardrobe full of 
Savile Row suits, a fleet of exotic cars, and a host of celebrity 
acquaintances.

But his
 glamorous lifestyle disintegrated when he was accused of fleecing 
businessmen crippled by the credit crunch. Davenport and his 
co-defendants, Peter Riley and Borge Andersen, were last year convicted 
of advance-fee fraud at Southwark Crown Court.

The
 men formed a company, Gresham Ltd (whose name bore a remarkable 
resemblance to an unconnected City firm of 50 years standing) and 
offered loans to companies desperate for finance.

More
 than 100 clients were asked to pay non-returnable ‘due diligence fees’ 
for loans that never materialised. Altogether, Gresham Ltd charged fees 
of more than £4  million – of which Davenport personally received 
£773,000.

The judge 
claimed Davenport was the ‘ringmaster’ who was  careful not to leave 
‘footprints in the snow’. Davenport, meanwhile, continues to stretch 
credulity by claiming he was a dupe who was unaware of the bigger deals 
his partners were negotiating abroad.

‘I’m
 keeping my head down pending my appeal,’ he said. ‘Prison can be a 
dangerous place. I want to just get on with it, though having been 
institutionalised in boarding school helps.’

He has witnessed a fellow prisoner running around naked covered in blue paint, and another attempting suicide by slashing his wrists. He says: ‘I was thrown in the deep end from the start when I had to share a cell with a heroin addict. He managed to get hold of drugs in prison and he kept trying to pick a fight with me.’

His cellmate’s possession of drugs cost him his prison privileges. Davenport says: ‘I had to give back my laptop. But the worst thing was that when my mother came to visit, I had to talk with her from behind glass. I could see she was upset.’ He smiles admiringly as he recalls the way Jean, 78, coped with the indignity of a body search. ‘She shouted, “Do you really think  a woman like me is smuggling drugs in here?” ’

Another regular visitor is Davenport’s Thai girlfriend of eight years, nightclub promoter Monthira Sanan-Ua, 28. ‘He is putting a brave face on it,’ she says. ‘Sometimes he gets a bit jealous because he knows I’m having a good time outside. Whether we get married,  I don’t know. Like Eddie, I take each day as it comes. Nothing has changed the way I feel about him.’

As a low-risk, category-C prisoner, Davenport is able to wear  his own clothes – a Sloaney ensemble of William Hunt shirt, True  Religion jeans and Gucci loafers – under prison outerwear, today a luminous overall. And his good behaviour means he now has his own cell with a television (his favourite shows are Made In Chelsea and the new Dallas), a lavatory and a supply of tinned groceries.

‘One thing about being in here is that I’ve realised how lucky I am,’ he says. ‘I was loved and well brought-up.’

However, the root of his craving for company and attention may stem from his comfortable upbringing in West London. An only child, Davenport’s late father, Ormus, was a restaurateur who ran a fashionable Chelsea bistro in the Seventies. ‘I was left to my own devices a lot as my parents always seemed to be working.’

He was sent to fee-paying Frensham Heights School in Surrey, chosen because it had a lively drama department. ‘My dream then was to be an actor, but I realised I wasn’t any good. I under-achieved because I was dyslexic. Maybe that’s why I always want to prove myself.’ He left school with a single O-level in law.

He knew from his experience as a boarder that privately educated teenagers were desperate to meet the opposite sex.

His riotous Gatecrasher Balls became an overnight sensation, making him a millionaire before the taxman caught up with him.

Yet by far Davenport’s biggest coup was  buying the 24-bedroom Portland Place property, complete with billiard room, ballroom and Jacuzzi.

He put the house to lucrative work as a set for fashion and film shoots and, unrelated to his sex parties, it was the venue for glitzy events attended by Kate Moss, Mick Jagger and Paris Hilton.

Davenport has never been able to resist a get-rich-quick scheme, a weakness that has twice put  him behind bars. ‘I can assure  you that being locked up is no holiday camp, it’s hell,’ he says. ‘The prison is often short-staffed, which means we can be banged up in our cells for long stretches.’

He is studying information technology and Buddhism. ‘I like to think it makes me a better person. When I get out of here, I will be a more responsible businessman.

‘I haven’t given up yet. I am banned from being a company director for ten years, but I will start all over again somehow, probably by organising parties.

‘I miss the fun. Not being able to be with a woman is also hard – all the guys feel it. They all want to know about the orgies. They were classy and sensual, with masks, candles, velvet cushions. Outside,

I mixed with everybody from Hugh Grant to Prince Albert of Monaco, in here I’m just one of the lads.’Davenport’s next challenge is his appeal next month. ‘I am mentally prepared to pay up,’ he says. ‘My appeal gives me hope that there may be light at the end of the tunnel.

That and the dream that one day I will be back in Portland Place having fabulous parties.’
