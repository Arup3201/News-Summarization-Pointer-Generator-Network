Roy Hodgson will make nine changes for England's final World Cup match against Costa Rica on Tuesday.

With their elimination already confirmed ahead of the final Group D encounter, the Three Lions boss promised to make changes in Belo Horizonte.

The guessing game began straight after those comments and Hodgson was asked if he could shed any light on the team that would face the group leaders.

Surprisingly, the England boss named his entire starting line-up, with Gary Cahill and Daniel Sturridge the only survivors from last week's 2-1 defeat to Uruguay.

'Well, Ben Foster will play in goal,' Hodgson said. 'The right-back will be Phil Jones.

'Gary Cahill will play centre-half alongside Chris Smalling, and Luke Shaw will play left-back.

'In midfield we will have Milner, Lampard, Wilshere, Barkley, Lallana and Sturridge will play up front.'

Hodgson insists this is not a team just to give everyone a run out, though, with the Three Lions boss confident they can win the match - one which they need a positive result from to avoid becoming the first England side to lose all three World Cup group games.

England XI to play Costa Rica (4-3-3): Foster; Jones, Cahill, Smalling, Shaw; Milner, Lampard, Wilshere; Barkley, Lallana, Sturridge.

'With a very different team and a lot of players who haven't played in the tournament so far, I wanted everyone to go home from this tournament - or at least as many as possible - having taken part and played in a game, not just training,' he said.

'We're very conscious of the fact that our fans are as disappointed and devastated as we are, but they are still here supporting us.

'We came into the hotel and received a lot of sympathy, kind words from them and we really want to make certain tomorrow night that they see something tomorrow that they can take some encouragement from.

'And most importantly of all, it's a top-class international on the biggest stage of all, the World Cup, so anything else than taking the game very seriously and trying to win the game in its own right would be out of the question.'

Meanwhile, Hodgson has reflected on the pain of England's World Cup humiliation.

'I've learned how painful it is to build up your hopes, to see a lot of good preparation proved to be to no avail because it didn't get us where we wanted,' he said.

'I've realised that, at this top level in a World Cup, it's unforgiving. A moment really of sheer misfortune can throw everyone into a realm of despair that you didn't know was possible.

'Tomorrow's game will tell me a lot about the players. It's been a very tough few days and it's hard to pick yourselves up for a game that, even if you do well in, serves no purpose.

'The 100 cap players will find that hard. We'll learn a lot about the others. I've liked what I've seen around the hotel and in training. I'm now giving them the opportunity, not because I can, but because this is a good team on the field and they can go and win the game. I hope they prove me right.'
