What we believed as children about the soul and the afterlife shapes what we believe as adults, even if we don't admit it, scientists claim.

A study has found that our personal beliefs change very little as we grow up, but what we tell others we believe does.

It suggests that such private beliefs are as strong among religious people as and non-religious.

A new study has found that our implicit beliefs about souls and the afterlife change very little as we grow up, but what our explicit beliefs – what we claim to believe – does. A painting called 'The poem of the soul' by Louis Janmot is pictured

Stephanie Anglin, a doctoral student in psychology at Rutgers University in New Jersey began the study by assuming that people have deeply ingrained beliefs about the soul and the afterlife, and set out to measure them. 

She asked 348 undergraduate psychology students about their beliefs concerning the soul and afterlife when they were 10 years old and at their present age of just over 18. 

Ms Anglin found that participants’ beliefs about the soul and the afterlife were close to what they remembered as their childhood beliefs.

But those beliefs were often very different from what they openly told people they believed now.

Stephanie Anglin looked at how implicit beliefs about the afterlife varied between religious and non-religious people and found no difference between them. ‘That suggests that implicit beliefs are equally strong among religious and non-religious people,’ she said.

People across the world, regardless of their religion or culture, believe that humans are immortal, according to research published in January.

Scientists think the belief that part of us is eternal emerges early in life and is part of our human nature, rather than something that is imposed on a person by a culture or religion.

Researchers from Boston University examined children’s ideas about the time before conception and interviewed 283 children from two very different cultures in Ecuador.

The study suggests that we often think the part of us that is eternal is not our ability to reason, but our desires and emotions - so we are what we feel.

Deborah Kelemen, an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University said the study 'helps us understand some universal aspects of human cognition and the structure of the mind.’

Most studies into the possibility of an afterlife have found that both children and adults commonly believe that bodily needs such as hunger end when people die and emotions continue in some form, but they do not question where such beliefs come from.

In the study, cultural influences had no bearing on whether the children believed in immortality.

Children who took part in the study reasoned that their bodies didn't exist before birth and that they didn't have the ability to think or remember.

But they also said that their emotions and desires existed before they were born.

The human trait to believe in immortality might be a by-product of our highly developed social reasoning as humans tend to see others as the sum of their mental states – and desires and emotions are particularly helpful when predicting behaviour.

The idea of the soul surviving outside the body, while non-scientific, is natural and deep-seated, the researchers said.

She looked out how implicit beliefs varied between religious and non-religious people and found no difference between them.

‘That suggests that implicit beliefs are equally strong among religious and non-religious people,’ she said. 

Ms Anglin wasn’t surprised by the findings because she was aware of a 2009 experiment in which researchers asked people to sign a contract selling their souls for $2.

‘Almost nobody signed, even though the researchers told them it wasn't actually a contract and would be shredded right away,’ she explained.

This was despite some participant claiming they did not believe in an afterlife.

Ms Anglin used a well-known statistical tool called the Implicit Association Test, to gauge subjects' implicit beliefs about the soul and afterlife.

Such social psychology tests measure the strength of a person's automatic association between concepts in memory.

In Ms Anglin’s test, each subject saw two concept words paired on the top of a computer screen, so that ‘soul’ was paired with either ‘real’ or ‘fake’ to gauge their beliefs about the soul.

The word ‘soul’ was paired either with ‘eternal’ or ‘death’ to address beliefs about the afterlife.

A series of words then flashed on the screen, and the subjects indicated matched them with the two words at the top.

‘For example, if you had “soul” and “fake” on your screen, words like “false” or “artificial” would fit into that category, but words like “existing” or “true” would not,’ she explained.

Ms Anglin concedes that her study is not conclusive because she did not study the relationship of participants’ beliefs with their views about social or political issues, for example.

She also had to rely on her subjects' memories of what they believed when they were children.

‘It would be really useful to have a longitudinal study examining the same ideas,’ Ms Anglin said.

‘That is, study a group of people over time, from childhood through adulthood, and examine their beliefs about the soul and afterlife as they develop.’

The study was published in the British Journal of Social Psychology.
