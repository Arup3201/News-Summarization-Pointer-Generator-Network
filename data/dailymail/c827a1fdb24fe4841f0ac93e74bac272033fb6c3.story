The Home Secretary's former grace-and-favour home has sold for an eye-watering £14million - more than three times what the Labour government got for it just four years ago.

The six-bedroom house in upmarket Belgravia, central London, was put on the market for £4million as the credit crunch hit in September 2008.

It fell into disuse and was invaded by squatters as the Home Office took 18 months to find a buyer - and accounts suggest it could have sold for as little as £3million in April 2010.

Eye-watering: The Home Secretary's former grace-and-favour home in Belgravia, central London, has sold for £14million - more than three times what the government got for it in the recession just four years ago

Home: The central London property was once occupied by David Blunkett (right at his front door in 2005)

Less than four years later, it has been sold on to a property firm for an enormous mark-up.

London Leasehold Properties paid £14million for the house in February - helped by the previous owners winning permission to turn it into a sprawling luxury home with an 'iceberg' basement.

David Blunkett was the last Home Secretary to live in the shabby postwar house before the government ruled it was no longer needed.

He hit out at the apparent wasted opportunity, telling The Sun: 'It would have been nice if they [the government] had got a more substantial investment back'.

The house made headlines in 2009 when it was invaded by serial squatter Mark Guard, who put a 'legal warning' on the window and invited reporters into his new home for an interview.

Outdated: A Home Office spokesman insisted the home, pictured in 2009, was in need of refurbishment

'It's a disgrace,' he told the Daily Mail at the time. 'Why the hell do they leave a place like this empty? It has lost about £2million in value since Blunkett went and there are more like this in the ownership of Gordon Brown's government.

'In Belgravia alone there are 312 properties left empty by offshore companies and more that are just being left to rot.' 

But the Home Office was also a victim of a crippling recession followed by spiralling London house prices.

Average prices near Mr Bunkett's former home in South Eaton Place have risen £2million - 50 per cent - since the depths of the recession in 2009.

A Home Office spokesman refused to confirm  how much the house sold for in 2010.

The department's accounts, however, list what is thought to be the former grace and favour home, and put the final sale value of the building and land at just £3.029million.

Just three years later, the house's new owners exploded its value by winning planning permission to knock it down and turn it into two eight-storey homes - including three levels in the basement.

The 'iceberg' homes approved last year would include a cinema room, snooker room, wine store, offices and a garage with a car lift.

It is not thought building work had started when it was sold on for £14million in February. 

A Home Office spokesman told MailOnline: 'The property was put up for sale under the last government as it was no longer required by the Home Office.

'It was publicly advertised and marketed by Savills before being sold in April 2010.

'It was in need of refurbishment and achieved the best possible price in the market at the time.'
