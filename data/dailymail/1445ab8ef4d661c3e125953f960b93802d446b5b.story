The Duchess of Cambridge has booked a hairdresser for her Australian tour with Prince William next year.

Sydney-based Joh Bailey, who tended to Princess Diana's hair when she was in the country in 1996, has been enlisted to style Katherine's while she is Down Under.

The Duchess, 31, will tour Australia in 2014 with the Duke of Cambridge and baby Prince George. Dates are yet to be confirmed.

 frizz: Kate has booked hairdresser Joh Bailey in Sydney

In August, Prince William told two Australians in Anglesey he was 'very hopeful' he and the Duchess would take Prince George on the tour.

Diana broke with tradition when she insisted nine-month-old William join her and Prince Charles in Australia in 1983. Before that, royal babies stayed at home while parents toured.

'[Diana] was the most elegant and gracious lady you could have imagined,' Bailey told an Australian newspaper.

'She had a ball in Sydney and loved everything about the city... she was a lot of fun.

'She would sit in the chair flicking through newspaper and magazine clippings, and read absolutely everything the tabloids wrote about her.

'She had a huge pile of them, throwing them onto the floor either in disgust or laughing...  she was very aware of her image.'

On Friday, Kate embarked on her first solo public engagement since the birth of her baby son.

She took part in a sports workshop at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in East London run by SportsAid, a charity which supports young athletes at the start of their careers.

The Duchess became patron of the organisation last year and was, said aides, keen to meet the athletes it was helping face-to-face and get a 'detailed insight into the challenges they face'.
