Look away now if you don't like creepy-crawlies: a new space celebrating the tiniest members of the animal kingdom has opened in London.

Dubbed the Micrarium, the exhibition is at the Grant Museum of Zoology, part of University college London.

But take heart if you don't like things with lots of legs: these really are tiny.

The critters on display are among the tiniest in the natural world.

Although 95 per cent of known animal species are smaller than your thumb, most natural history museums tend to concentrate on their much bigger cousins - right up to the giant dinosaurs.

To right this wrong, the Grant Museum has converted an old office into a beautiful back-lit cave covered with wall-to-wall microscope slides.

Now is your chance to get up close and personal with a young cuttlefish

Grant Museum manager Jack Ashby said: 'While public displays very much focus on larger animals, most natural history collections have thousands of very small specimens kept in their storerooms which are rarely shown to the public.

The Grant Museum of Zoology is the only remaining university zoological museum in London.

It houses around 67,000 specimens - including those now on display in the Micrarium.

'The huge majority of life on Earth is absolutely tiny, and we thought we'd right that wrong.'

The Grant Museum, whose history stretches back to before the Victorian era, has an eclectic group of items typical of 19th-century collections.

It houses a giant deer skull, an unusual batch of animal brains pickled in alcohol, and an even eerier-looking jar jammed full of preserved moles.

Mr Ashby said the back-lit walls of the Micrarium - housed in a former storage room within the larger museum - display 2,323 slides of mini-monsters, from tortoise beetles to baby cuttlefish.

Many of the slides were once used as study aids for British zoology and anatomy students and that some of them date back to the 1850s.

He added that visitors who have trouble making out the ancient slides will be equipped with magnifying glasses.

Copepods are tiny crustaceans found in both the sea and nearly every freshwater habitat

Founded in 1827 as a teaching 
collection, the museum is packed full of skeletons, mounted animals and 
specimens preserved in fluid.

Many of the species are now endangered or extinct including the Tasmanian tiger or thylacine, the quagga and the dodo.

The exhibition has just opened to the public - but don't all come at once. The room is rather small.
