A town in Germany took the controversial step of employing asylum seekers to carry passengers' luggage during renovation work at the train station. 

They were paid €1.05 an hour to act as porters at the station in the town of Schwäbisch Gmünd.

The ten refugees, originally from African countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan, currently reside in the 250-strong refugee shelter in the town.

Helping hand: The group of 10 asylum seekers were paid just over a euro per hour to help rail passengers carry their luggage over a temporary bridge at the German station

Strengthening community: The refugees, from Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, wore red t-shirts with the word 'service' printed on

All were volunteers for the jobs and no benefits were dependent upon them working.

Clad in red T-shirts declaring 'Service' - together with straw hats to shield them from the sun - the refugees worked in teams of two, completing two luggage-hauling shifts a day between 6.15am and 6pm.

Porters: The meagre sum is the most asylum seekers can earn in Germany by law

The town - which is getting a face-lift as it prepares to host the state of  Baden-Wüttermberg's State Garden Festival next year - employed the refugees after receiving complaints from passengers unwilling or unable to carry their own luggage over a temporary steel bridge between platforms during renovation work.

The meagre wage – paid on top of free transport to and from work - is the maximum asylum seekers can earn in Germany by law.

'It's not a sum that serves as an incentive,' said town spokesman Markus Hermann. 

'Everyone wishes they could be paid more.'

The scheme in the German town was praised by the mayor Richard Arnold

One way is to appeal to passengers – who have welcomed the new porters - to give them generous tips to supplement their earnings, said Hermann.

Schwäbisch Gmünd Mayor Richard Arnold is keen to get the refugees involved in the community – and sees the station work as just one way to encourage contact between locals and the asylum seekers.

'These people are living with us and we have to take care of them,' Mayor Arnold said of the porters, who are seen in pictures provided by Gmuender Tagespost.
