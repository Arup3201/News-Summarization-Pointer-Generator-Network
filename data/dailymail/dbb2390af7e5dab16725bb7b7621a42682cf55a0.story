Hero: Lost Scotsman Sergeant Alexander Barrie was among eight wartime servicemen whose remains laid unidentified until a historian solved the mystery

The remains of a 'lost' Scots airman who saved a pilot from a burning plane a week before he was killed in World War Two have finally been found 68 years on.

Sergeant Alexander Barrie and seven other RAF servicemen perished when their Halifax bomber was shot down over Denmark in 1943.

A week before his death, Sgt Barrie, from Cupar, Fife, rescued a US pilot whose aircraft crashed and burst into flames at Grantham, Lincs.

He rushed into the burning wreckage and dragged the badly-wounded pilot to safety, an act for which he was posthumously awarded the British Empire Medal.

For nearly seven decades, Sgt Barrie and his seven comrades have lain in unmarked graves in a Danish cemetery as none of them were identifiable due to the impact of the crash.

Now dedicated Danish historian Anders Straarup has solved the mystery and identified all eight airmen, bringing great comfort and relief to their families.

They will travel to Bispebjerg, Denmark, for a ceremony to dedicate the new marked Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstones with the correct names on.

Retired schoolteacher Mr Straarup discovered the truth after unearthing old photos of the aircraft wreckage and a German report describing the plane involved.

Remarkably, he also traced 
eye-witnesses to the crash after nearly seven decades by placing an 
appeal for help in a local newspaper.

The new information helped him whittle the potential aircraft down to Halifax bomber DT628.

Perished: Novice serviceman Deryk Martin (left) was on his maiden flight to gain more experience when the plane, piloted by Sgt Bruce Brett, was shot down

One of the reasons why it has taken so
long to learn the truth is because there are seven graves for the eight
men that were on board.

The Germans who buried their remains assumed there were seven of them because that was the usual number of a bomber crew.

But
the aircraft in question was carrying novice pilot Deryk Martin on his 
maiden flight so he could gain operational experience.

Also,
the War Office wrongly informed the families the plane had crashed at 
sea after an unidentified airman was washed ashore at Holland.

Mr
Martin's younger brother Anthony, 80, from Melton Mowbray, 
Leicestershire, today said it is a wonderful but emotional time for his 
family.

Names to remains: Sgt Roland Lyster was navigating on the doomed flight, while Sgt John Waring was the aircraft engineer. They have finally been recognised

He said: 'Our only regret is that our mother, father and elder brother didn't get to find out what happened to Deryk.

'He was reported as missing believed killed in action and then it was thought the plane had crashed in the sea.

'My
mother held out hope that Deryk had been taken prisoner and after the 
war she believed he was suffering from amnesia in a corner of Europe 
somewhere.

'So to hear this 
news after 68 years and the prospect of being able to pay hommage and 
say goodbye to him is staggeringly wonderful.'

Mr Martin's nephew, Nigel Martin, 49, added: 'The gratitude my father, uncles and auntie feel towards Anders is enormous.

'At last the story has come to an end and they can honour their brother properly and say a proper goodbye.'

Jean Brett, 86, from Ferndown, Dorset, is the younger sister of pilot Sergeant Bruce Brett.

She said: 'I am very pleased and relieved to hear this news after so long.'

Mr
Straarup, 67, said he felt compelled to identify the unmarked graves at 
the Bisperbjerg cemetery out of gratitude to the war dead.

He said: 'This is my way of showing my respect and gratitude to those who fought and died for our freedom.

'At that time, in the middle of the war, the Allies were our friends and because of them we ended up a free nation.'

Tragedy: The wreckage of the men's Halifax bomber shot down over Denmark during World War Two. Remarkably, historian Anders Staarup even tracked down eyewitnesses to the crash as he sought to find their identities

The crew of DT628 were pilot Sgt Bruce
Brett, navigator Sgt Roland Lyster, bomb aimer Pilot Officer Ronald 
Glover, wireless operator Sgt Peter Shortland, flight engineer Sgt John 
Waring, mid upper gunner Sgt Clifford Vandy, rear gunner Sgt Alexander 
Barrie and second pilot Sgt Deryk Martin.

On
the night of April 20, 1943, Halifax DT628 of 51 Squadron, Lincs, was 
part of a formation of 339 bombers on a raid on German munitions 
factories in Poland.

While 
over the Danish coast the aircraft was struck by German flak. Realising 
they were going down, the crew dumped the 1,000lbs bomb in a field 
before crashing at Halskov.

The impact caused the remaining incendiary bombs and fuel to blow the Halifax apart.

Anonymous: The cemetery in Bisperbjerg, Denmark, where the eight men were buried in unmarked graves

Finally honoured: The Bisperbjerg ceremony is officially opened. The families of the men will now travel there to dedicate the new marked Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstones

Mr
Straarup said: 'In local archives I found some photos of the plane 
wreckage and was able to identify a Rolls Royce Merlin engine which 
Halifax bombers had.

'Another photo showed a feature of the undercarriage which proved it was definitely a Halifax.

'I then placed an article in a local newspaper and to my surprise several eye-witnesses who are still alive today came forward.

'They stated the bomber came in over Denmark with the main force when it was shot at and crashed at Halskov.

'I also found German reports with a list of 30 aircraft that were shot down in this operation - 19 of them were shot down on Danish territory.'

The man to thank: Determined historian Anders Straarup has closed a chapter in history that was shrouded in mystery

Mr Straarup then contacted Peter Gilmore at the 51 Squadron History Society.

He confirmed eight Halifax bombers crashed over Denmark and seven of them are accounted for.

After checking the names on the Runneymede Memorial in Surrey for lost airmen, Mr Gilmore was able to confirm the names of the crew through a process of elimination.

With the 'jigsaw' of evidence pieced together, Mr Straarup presented it to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission which agreed it had been proved beyond doubt.

Neil Smith, of the 51 Squadron History Society, said: 'When Anders approached us for help we were able to prove the graves must belong to the crew of DT628 because we traced all of the other British bombers that crashed that night and every other aircraft we were able to pin to a different geographical location.

'The crew has lain in anonymous graves for the last 68 years.

'Now we have traced all of the families and most of them are planning a trip to Denmark to visit their loved one's graves next spring for a ceremony.'
