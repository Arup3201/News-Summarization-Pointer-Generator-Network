Cooking is my thing. I’m a trained chef and it’s what I love doing most. But still, there are some things I just don’t have time to make.

Jars of factory-made pesto and mayonnaise are regulars on my shopping list. And there are dishes that never seem to work out, such as my pavlovas, which often flop or crack.

I’m sure I’m not the only busy mum who often wishes I had an extra pair of hands in the kitchen. My husband is too busy with Very Important Meetings to help with the cooking, and our daughters, aged nine and ten, are too young to be trusted with tasks much beyond making cupcakes.

Anne Shooter says the Thermomix is expensive but worth every penny as it chops, stirs and blends dishes

But a new addition to my household could be the answer to my prayers. At £925, the Thermomix is expensive — but if it’s as adept as is claimed, it will be worth every penny.

My new best friend is not so much a food processor as a mini robot. It was invented in 1971 by German company Vorwerk and is loved by Michelin-starred chefs from Heston Blumenthal to Raymond Blanc.

Besides blending, it can heat, chop and stir, as well as taking the slog out of tricky dishes such as risotto and mayonnaise as well as whipping up an instant sorbet or ice cream.

Now it has been overhauled for the 21st-century home kitchen. Most impressively, it has a touch screen that displays recipes and step-by-step guidance on making bread, cakes, soups, salads, mousses and more.

The grey and white machine looks like a medical testing kit — a metal jug on a white base with a few knobs and a small screen.

The base contains scales, with the weight shown on the display, so you can add 200g of butter, reset the scale to zero on the touchscreen, then add 200g of flour and so on.

The machine can also heat up the jug to 120c, so dishes can be warmed to specific temperatures.

Inside the jug are four super-sharp blades attached to a motor which, at the highest setting, can pulverise fruit, vegetables, herbs and even dried beans in seconds.

The base contains scales, with the weight shown on the display, so you can add 200g of butter, reset the scale to zero on the touchscreen, then add 200g of flour and so on.

To start, you turn on the machine and select the cookery book option on the screen. There are 200 recipes to choose from and you get a step-by-step run-through of each.

Once all ingredients have been added, the display states the speed required.

The machine is programmed to know how long the motor must run and the temperature required. More complex dishes require ingredients to be added throughout the process, in which case the Thermomix stops and waits for you to do so. Once the new ingredient is added, you select ‘next’ again. When the recipe is completed, the display says ‘done’.

Frankly, I thought the machine sounded too good to be true, so I decided to test out eight recipes including time-consuming risotto and the pesto I usually buy.

Is it just another maddening gadget? Or the miracle aid busy mums have been waiting for?

Mayonnaise

The egg mixture often splits when I make mayo, so this will surely put the machine to the test.

I crack an egg into the machine and add lemon juice, mustard powder, salt and pepper, and run the motor for 90 seconds while drizzling 300g of sunflower oil through the hole in the top of the jug onto the egg mixture.

At the end, the machine turns itself off, I look in the bowl and am amazed to find wonderfully glossy mayonnaise — perfect for my lunchtime sandwich.

Verdict

This took less than two minutes and tastes far superior to anything you get in the supermarket.

Rustic bread

There’s nothing like freshly baked bread, but it’s tricky to do well. The Thermomix prompts me to add pre-measured amounts of water, buttermilk and yeast to the jug.

On a touch of the ‘next’ button, the jug heats to 32 degrees — the perfect heat for yeast — and I set the dial to a gentle ‘2’ so it stirs rather than whizzes.

Then I am told to add 600g flour, plus salt, balsamic vinegar and malt extract, which I weigh into the jug as instructed.

When I next start the machine it works in reverse, gently kneading the dough, rather than chopping it. Then I can tip out my soft, springy dough and leave it to rise, before baking in the oven.

Verdict

The most delicious, wholesome bread I have ever tasted.

Yoghurt cake

The Thermomix screen tells me to preheat the oven and grease my round bundt pan (for a cake with a hole in the middle).

Then I follow the instructions to add lemon zest and sugar and turn the motor. Next, in go three eggs, which unfortunately I do have to crack myself.

These are followed by flour, yogurt, sunflower oil, salt and baking powder, which I pour through the same hole into the jug. A minute of whizzing at speed six and my batter is ready to pour into the tin to bake in the oven.

Verdict

A superb, light, fluffy cake made in less than half the time it would usually take me.

Strawberry and banana sorbet

I measure 60g of sugar into the Thermomix and blitz it at speed seven for ten seconds to make it super-fine.

Then I add 500g of frozen strawberries and some bananas, together with an egg white and a squeeze of lemon juice, then whizz for 90 seconds. That’s it. Stunning sorbet, ready to eat.

Verdict

This is like magic and the sorbet is incredibly moreish.

Beetroot salad

I’m cynical as I start making this. After all, salads are easy and I am the queen of chopping.

Still, I add four scrubbed and trimmed beetroots, two carrots, an apple, shallot, a little oil, salt, sugar and lemon juice and whizz it for — wait for it — five seconds.

I’m surprised to find perfect chopped salad (far smaller and neater than I could chop), dressed and ready to serve.

Verdict

Delicious and possibly the easiest food I’ve ever made.

Risotto

I find risotto a chore to make with all that stirring, so I can’t wait to see if the Thermomix makes it more quickly.

First I add 80g of Parmesan, whizz it so it is grated finely and tip into a small bowl. Then I add a shallot, whizz that, then butter and olive oil, which the machine weighs for me.

Next the machine stirs and heats everything — sauteeing my shallot perfectly. I add rice and white wine, which bubbles for one minute, followed by stock, seasoning and a pinch of saffron. The machine cooks and stirs the mixture for 13 minutes. When it’s done, I add the Parmesan.

Verdict

This is as good as any I have had in an Italian restaurant.

Pesto

I whizz the Parmesan in the machine for 15 seconds. I add pine nuts, garlic, basil leaves, salt and extra virgin olive oil, and blitz it for 20 seconds. Pesto, done in less than a minute.

Verdict

I cannot believe that fresh pesto can be made in less than a minute and taste this good. I’ll never buy a jar again.

Profiteroles

Choux pastry involves lots of bicep-busting stirring, so I rarely bother. To make choux in a Thermomix, you simply add water, butter and flour to the machine. It heats and stirs everything until a smooth consistency is achieved.

After the jug has cooled, you crack in three eggs while the mixture is being stirred — and that is it. Pipe or spoon the dough onto baking sheets and bake.

Verdict

Even Bake Off’s Paul and Mary would be impressed with these.

Conclusion

Hold a car boot sale and sell off your kitchen appliances. Then buy yourself a Thermomix!
