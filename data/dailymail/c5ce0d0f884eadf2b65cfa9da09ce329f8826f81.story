Portuguese police are under mounting pressure to give Scotland Yard access to three ‘prime suspects’ wanted for questioning over the abduction of Madeleine McCann.

British prosecutors have written to their counterparts in Portugal, seeking urgent help with their investigation into her disappearance.

A second ‘International Letter of Request’ – outlining inquiries that Met detectives want carried out by the Portuguese – was sent by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) last week.

Request: The Met want to interview three prime suspects who could be linked to disappearance of Madeleine McCann

Officers are thought to be pursuing three burglars who were operating in the area when she went missing

It was dispatched a few days after the
 Daily Mail exclusively revealed that Scotland Yard has identified three
 local burglars as ‘prime suspects’ after an extensive trawl through 
mobile phone records.

Analysis
 of mobile phone data suggests that the men were ‘very close’ to the 
scene of Madeleine’s disappearance when she vanished.

It also indicates they made an unusually high number of calls to each other in the hours that followed her abduction in 2007.

British detectives believe Madeleine may have been abducted during a bungled burglary.

The
 CPS first sent an International Letter of Request on behalf of British 
police in July, when the Met upgraded its review - codenamed Operation 
Grange - to a formal investigation, in light of new evidence and new 
witnesses.

Yesterday the CPS
 and Scotland Yard refused to comment on the detail of the latest letter
 to the Portuguese, apart from confirming it was sent last week.

Madeleine McCann's parents, Kate and Gerry, described the latest move as a 'significant development'

A spokesman for Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry said: 'The letter is a significant development.

'It is necessary for British police to request the Portuguese authorities allow them to operate on their turf.

'It
 means they have the intention of arresting and interviewing X, Y or Z. 
We don't know who they have their sights on but it's likely it is the 
burglars.

'Whether the Portuguese will co-operate remains to be seen. It is a very sensitive issue with differences they have had.

'Police
 want to be given a chance to arrest key suspects. It doesn't prove they
 have Madeleine but it will rule them in or out of the investigation and
 that is important.

'Kate and Gerry don't want to build up their hopes too high but they realise it could be a significant new lead.'

Resort: Madeleine McCann went missing from her apartment in The Ocean Club in Praia Da Luz in 2007

Informed sources denied claims that arrests are imminent in the Madeleine case.

One said: ‘The legal system in Portugal is very different to the UK, and it could be many months before any arrests take place.’

Despite the words of caution, Met commanders are privately delighted with progress being made in its investigation.

A
 Yard spokesman said: 'We can confirm that a second International Letter
 of Request (ILOR) has been sent to the Portuguese authorities by the 
Crown Prosecution Service, week commencing 6 January, in connection with
 Operation Grange.'

Madeleine,
 who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday 
apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3 2007 as her parents 
dined at a nearby restaurant with friends.

It is now known that between January and May 2007 there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area.

Police
 said in October that in the 17 days before she disappeared there was 
one burglary and one attempted burglary in the block where the McCann 
family were staying.
