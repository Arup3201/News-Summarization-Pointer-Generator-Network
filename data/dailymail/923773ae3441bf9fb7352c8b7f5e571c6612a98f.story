Anyone who has ever had that sinking feeling when the eyes of the person they are talking to start to glaze, take heart - an app has been developed to make you less boring.

Us+ is an app for Google's Hangout video chat service that analyses what you are saying and makes suggestions based on how you are behaving.

For example, if you are constantly using words that it considers too negative it will display 'try to be more positive' on the screen.

Evasive: Us+ even tailors the things the user says to reflect the other person's statements

If you're babbling on about yourself without taking any interest in your mute conversational partner, Us+ will bluntly state: 'Stop talking about yourself so much.'

It was developed by U.S. artists Lauren McCarthy and Kyle McDonald, who aim to make people more personable, but are also making a statement about modern communication.

A video outlining how the app works shows 'Clare' moaning to her mother about a woman in her yoga class she percieves as selfish.

After a short time she is told to be less self-absorbed, so she changes tack and asks her mother how she is.

Word in edgeways: If one person blathers on for more than a minute their microphone is disconnected

Her mother answers the question vaguely 
and slightly evasively, hinting at a problem in her life but revealing 
little, so Us+ accuses: 'What are you hiding? Clare is speaking much 
more honestly.'

Another interesting - and potentially very useful - feature is demonstrated in another dialogue example: The automute.

Us+ uses Linguistic Inquiry and Word 
Count, a text analysis software programme that calculates the degree to 
which people use different categories of words when they communicate.

It
 determines whether the speaker is using positive or negative emotions, 
self-references, causal words, and other language patterns.

It also uses Linguistic Style 
Matching, which analyses the tendency of participants in a conversation 
to use a common vocabulary and similar sentence structures.

If you speak for longer than a minute 
the app automatically switches off your microphone so the other person 
can have their say.

A
 panel on the right of the screen displays information about how 
positive, self-absorbed, feminine and aggressive the talker is being.

Ms
 McCarthy, who says the project is also an art installation, does admit 
to fears about the way technology like this can be applied.

She told The Huffington Post:
 'With a big company like Google building products, there's a lot of 
room for them to determine what's the optimal social behavior they're 
trying to achieve.

'And then they have the audience and tools to really make that happen,' she notes.

She
 personally demonstrated this possibility by hacking the app while on a 
videom chat with her boyfriend secretlt controlling the feedback he 
received to messages like: 'You should sound more positive' and 'You 
should make Lauren smile more'.
