With her golden tan, plumped breasts and lips and bleach blonde hair extensions it would be easy to mistake 28-year-old Carolyn for Baywatch star Pamela Anderson.

And that's exactly what the Liverpudlian lookalike is hoping for, having spent £20,000 on surgery and cosmetic procedures to emulate her favourite celebrity.

Carolyn, who dubs herself 'Scouse Pammie' is now a professional lookalike, posing as the Canadian actress in personal appearances and at events around Liverpool. But the petite blonde wants one more procedure to complete the transformation: Pammy's barbed wire tattoo. 

The best: Carolyn says she's also an improvement on the original by virtue of being from Liverpool

Model Carolyn, from Crosby in Merseyside, has been obsessed with the buxom star since childhood and has put herself at risk numerous times in her quest to become a body double for 46-year-old Pamela.

As well as getting Botox, lip fillers, teeth whitening and false eyelashes applied she regularly injects herself with Melanotan II, an unregulated tanning drug, and has been using sunbeds since the tender age of 10-years-old, now spending up to 15 hours a week in her father's sunbed shop.

Following a chest augmentation in 2004 she has twice suffered with exploding breasts as her DD implants burst under sunbed lamps. The model needed seven operations to repair the damage but that hasn't stopped her pursuing her idea of Pammy perfection.

Carolyn, who changed her name to Pamela Anderson by Deed Poll in 2009, told The Mirror: 'I’ll admit it – I’m hooked. I’m what they call a tanorexic. But I couldn’t live without a tan – it’s a part of who I am. And I wouldn’t leave the house without one.

Scouse Pammie: Carolyn uses her blonde bombshell looks to help her in her career as a Pamela impersonator

'I used to watch ­Baywatch growing up and thought she was beautiful. I was delighted to think I looked like her. I became a bit obsessed with her in my teens and rewatched all the Baywatch shows. I just think she’s great.

'Any woman can have big breasts and blonde hair but she’s captured everyone’s attention for decades. It’s more than looks – she has charisma and intrigues people. That’s what I love and want to emulate.'

Mother-of-two Pamela had a barbed wire tattoo inked on her bicep as part of her role in the 1996 Barb Wire sci-fi film.

Now super fan Carolyn is planning on getting a carbon copy of the etching, telling the Daily Star: 'It's an iconic image that everyone associates with Pammy.

'I actually really like the tattoo.'
