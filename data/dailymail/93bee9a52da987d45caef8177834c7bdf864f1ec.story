Peter Lynagh went without sex for an entire year after his housemate bet him $2000 he couldn't

A Melbourne man who gave up sex for a year gained much more than he bargained for when a bet with a friend took on a life of its own.

In late 2012 Peter Lynagh joked with his housemate he was fed up with the single life, which revolved around late nights partying and one night stands.

'I was going to give up women and sex... He (my housemate) said I couldn't even go a week, then this got me wound up even more,' Mr Lynagh told the Daily Mail Australia.

From there what started as a $2000 bet between the pair grew to more than $50,000 being raised over the course of the year after a Facebook post 'went nuts' and Pete's Chastity for Charity was born.

'I had a flash of inspiration that I could give that money to the charity, make it bigger than me,' he said.

The rules were for an entire year from the 1st of January 2013, Mr Lynagh, 33 at the time, wasn't allowed to jump into bed with anyone at all, though kissing was passable.

He pledged to give all funds raised to Australian charity Free to Shine, an organisation which aims to save young Cambodian girls from the sex trade and instead educate them, and described the whole experience as 'a roller-coaster emotionally.'

However an early lapse meant he came very close to breaking the ban in the first few months, and admitted the woman he was with was the one who had to put on the brakes.

The Melbourne man set up a Facebook page called Pete's Chastity for Charity and raised more than $50K for a charity that supports children in Cambodia

'No one thought I could do it... I nearly came really close to breaking it, I started seeing a girl and I don't know why,' he revealed. 'I think she was just enjoying the fact I wasn't trying to get in her pants.'

'That was a turning point, I just said I really had to take it seriously.'

Mr Lynagh described the following months as a real journey of self-discovery, and along the way he found there were many parts of himself he wasn't entirely happy with.

He focused his energy into other aspects of his life, started his own business and took a trip to Cambodia in September to see where the money raised from his abstinence was going.

In September of last year he travelled overseas to work with the kids and see where the money was going

With his help the charity was able to employ extra workers on the ground and double the amount of girls it looked after. 'Once I'd seen what was happening, it was really humbling,' Mr Lynagh said.

From here, he has aspirations to start a charity of his own, but for now has thrown his support behind The Big Umbrella project, a joint effort with The Father Bob Maguire Foundation with promotes anti-slavery and rehabilitation programs in Nepal.

Earlier this year he made the trip to Kathmandu, and has just launched a fundraiser to deck out these kids, many of whom are orphans previously living on the streets, in brand new soccer gear.

He has plans to start a charity of his own, and although would never give up sex for that long again wants to do something equally as 'crazy'

When asked if he would ever go without sex for so long again, Mr Lynagh said he would be open to be doing something similar, but struggled to name something more difficult to give up.

'I don't think I would do no sex again for a year, I would like to something else crazy and out there and different.'

'If anyone can think of anything else crazy or quirky, I'm open to suggestions.'
