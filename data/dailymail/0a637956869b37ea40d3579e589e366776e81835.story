A 26-year-old New Zealand man was crushed and killed when a large log rolled on to him while completing community service work on Saturday.

The man and a colleague were doing maintenance work at a church in Wakefield, located in the north of the country's south island, when the accident happened.

Emergency services arrived at the scene at about 10am on Saturday, but the man later died from his injuries when taken to Nelson hospital, reported Stuff.co.nz.

A 26-year-old New Zealand man was crushed to death by a rolling log on Saturday

About two months ago, a large gumtree fell over and the men were cutting it into pieces, Wakefield vicar Allan Wasley said.

The vicar said the men were on a hill as they cut the tree into sections when a piece of log headed towards the man after coming loose.

Despite trying to outrun the log, because the man was standing below it, the section of wood ended up crushing him.

The vicar, who was inside while the men were working, said the accident was a tragedy and was being felt by the church.

At the time the accident took place, the man was doing community service at a church in Wakefield in the north of the New Zealand south island

'It's the last thing we want to see happen. My heart goes out to the man and his family.'

When the vicar was told about the accident, he rushed to help the trapped man along with multiple witness believed to have tried to rescue the worker, reported The New Zealand Herald.

Police are investigating the incident.

An investigation will also be carried out by coroner and the corrections department.
