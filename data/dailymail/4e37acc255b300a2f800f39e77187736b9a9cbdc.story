The rupture of relations between Manchester United and Nike will extend beyond a kit deal as the sportswear firm have decided to cut all ties with the club.

Nike confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that they have withdrawn from negotiations with United to extend their 13-year association with the club after becoming frustrated by United’s financial demands.

A Nike statement read: ‘Any partnership with a club or federation has to be mutually beneficial and the terms that were on offer for a renewed contract did not represent good value for Nike’s shareholders.’

Final showing: Nike's ties with Manchester United will end after the 2014/15 season

No rewarding value: Nike will not renew their 13-year deal with United, and it comes following a season where the Red Devils dropped out of Europe for the first time since 1990

Where it all began: Nike's relationship with United began in 2002, as David Beckham celebrates scoring a Premier League goal against Charlton

The sponsorship began in 2002 and will end at the end of this season, meaning that United will continue to offer Nike merchandise and wear Nike manufactured kit and leisure-wear until 2015.

Sportsmail has learned on Wednesday that the breaking off of relations also stretches to the Manchester United Soccer Schools, which were devised and jointly operated by the club and Nike

It also includes the sponsorship of the Manchester United Premier Cup, an Under 15 competition featuring over 8,000 teams, when one million of the world’s finest young talents come together every year.

Sportsmail also understands that the majority of coaches in the soccer schools are recruited and contracted by Nike, casting doubt over their future prospects.

A well-placed Nike source confirmed: 
‘The relationship continues until the end of the season and then Nike 
will no longer be involved with United.’

Nike’s
 refusal to cede to United’s demands clears the way for German firm 
adidas to move in, with a 10-year deal worth in the region of 
£750million understood to be under discussion.

Winning combo: Manchester United won the Champions League in 2008 while supplied by Nike

Welcome back: adidas are expected to take over from Nike in 2015 having last supplied United's kits in 1992

Adidas are expected to close a deal in the coming months, although United have also spoken with Warrior, Puma and Uniqlo, a Japanese company.

This is likely to be all-encompassing and inherit all aspects of the area that Nike have worked on, as adidas likely to assume responsibility for the soccer schools.

United’s strip for the new season - sponsored by Chevrolet and produced by Nike-  was officially released on Monday and will be worn until the end of this season.

An announcement is expected from adidas following the World Cup, in which they will clarify their position regarding taking over from Nike in 2015.
