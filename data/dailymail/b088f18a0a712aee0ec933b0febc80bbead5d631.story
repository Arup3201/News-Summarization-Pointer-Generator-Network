Coast guards are searching for 13 crew members missing from a fishing boat after their vessel collided with a much larger cargo ship in Japan's Pacific Ocean.

The missing 13 were part of a 22-man crew on board the 119-ton Horiei Maru, which crashed with the 25,000-ton Nikkei Tiger about 900 kilometres east of Sendai at 2.30am on Sunday morning.

It is believed the smaller ship - a tuna-fishing boat - might have sunk, officials from the Shiogama Coast Guard said.

Two planes from the coast guard have been sent to look for survivors, Osamu Nishikawa added.

Nine of the fishing boat's crew were rescued at about 7am on Sunday after the coast guard responded to a distress call. Five of the survivors are Japanese and four are Indonesian.Â 

Twelve of the missing are Japanese, and one is Indonesian. Coastguards are continuing the search for them.

The cargo ship, which officials say had come from Panama, was undamaged and its crew of 21 escaped without harm.

It is unclear what caused the accident.

Just last week coastguards in Japan came to the aid of a freight ship which had caught fire.

The 12-member crew - which included 10 Chinese nationals - were rescued off the coast of Nagasaki Prefecture.

Rescuers tend to a survivor pulled from the water. Two planes have been launched to search for the missing
