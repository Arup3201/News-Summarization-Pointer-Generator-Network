Abandoned and decaying, this eerie Cold War base was once was rumoured to house nuclear warheads in case of an attack but now stands empty, untouched since it was last used two decades ago.

RAF Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire was once a bustling strategic base for the U.S. Air Force, hosting huge B-52 bombers and a detachment of top secret U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, deployed to covertly check out latest Soviet weapons.

However, 20 years after it was handed back to the Ministry of Defence the abandoned buildings are slowly falling into ruin, yet still display poignant reminders of the troops once stationed there - even down to a menu offering tastes of home such as chilli dogs and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

Abandoned: RAF Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire was once a bustling strategic base for the U.S. Air Force, but now stands empty two decades after it was handed back to the Ministry of Defence, its air traffic control tower slowly decaying

Empty: A guard tower situated on the perimeter of the base. One soldier is said to have committed suicide while on guard here, and there are rumours it is haunted

On the menu: A faded menu in the base's canteen reveals that airmen were given a taste of home with chili dogs, hamburgers and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

The site had been used by the Royal Air Force primarily as a training base from 1918 to 1950, before it was transferred to the United States Air Force (USAF) at the beginning of the Cold War.

Under the control of US Strategic Air Command (SAC), and later as a home for United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), the base became a key strategic location during the period of political and military tension between East and West.

The site was visited by urban explorer Darmon Richter, who gained access to the military site through a friend involved in a project to conserve the base, protecting items and buildings which hold significant historical value.

In shadow: This darkened office was once the mission control centre at the base, which was transferred to the United States Air Force at the beginning of the Cold War

Reminder: This detailed graffiti featuring an old fashioned plane was scrawled on the wall of the avionic building by one bored airman

Warning: A sign printed onto the door of a walk-in freezer at the old barracks, as pictured by urban explorer Darmon Richter, who gained access to the military site through a friend involved in a conservation project at the site

Detail: A decaying map covers the wall of the mission control centre. Under the control of US Strategic Air Command the base became a key strategic location during the period of political and military tension between East and West

'Through him, I was able to gain approval for my visit. It would have been virtually impossible without that permission, as the large base is still patrolled and guarded by a full security team,' said Mr Richter, from nearby Oxford.

Amazingly, the menu in the troops' diner has survived intact, and a strong American theme - from chilli dogs, hamburgers and french fries to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches - is clearly evident.

'Stepping into the staff diner was like taking a trip back in time and across continents,' Mr Richter said.

'None of it struck me as particularly appetising, though I suppose it was intended to make the US airmen feel at home.'

Record: A log book, still intact after two decades, lies abandoned on top of a boiler in one of the derelict building at the Oxfordshire base

Rack and ruin: An overturned chair in the abandoned guardroom. Mr Richter described the base as 'unusually quiet', with no sounds of birds or other wildlife

Choice: The menu in the troops' diner has survived intact, and a strong American theme - from chilli dogs, hamburgers and french fries to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches - is clearly evident

Seat of power: The site's Mission Control bunker was in regular communication with airbases around the world

Control: The order given to bomb Libya in 1986 in response to a discotheque bombing in Berlin, as part of an operation codenamed 'El Dorado Canyon' was reportedly given from this control room

One building that Mr Richter encountered was formed from a giant block of concrete and painted with windows to give the impression of an unassuming house.

However, inside the reinforced concrete building, several vault doors led into a central storage space where the signs on the walls had been blacked out - with Mr Richter’s sources suggesting this was the space where nuclear warheads had been kept.

The site’s Mission Control bunker was in regular communication with airbases around the world, and it was reportedly here that the order was given to bomb Libya in 1986 in response to a discotheque bombing in Berlin, as part of an operation codenamed 'El Dorado Canyon'.

Dated technology: Sliding wall charts used display details of available aircraft and weaponry in the Heyford mission control centre

Telecommunications: Mr Richter described the sensation of walking through empty command rooms with the old maps and telephones as 'strange'

In use: The first group of United States Air Force personnel arrived on the station in July 1950, with the original organisation consisting of one officer and 26 airmen

Out of use: A rusting electricity generator, which once helped provide the base, first used in 1916 as a home for the Royal Flying Corps, with power

Geography: Only a few details of this map of Hungary can still be seen, as it peels off the walls of the abandoned mission control centre

Warning: A caution board at the side of the main runway, which stretches for a total distance of 8,300 ft after it was extended in 1950 when the American forces moved in

'It was a strange feeling, to walk through the empty command rooms with their maps and telephones, where these bombing orders had once been given,' Mr Richter said.

'The base felt at times unnaturally quiet. Although grass and vegetation grows throughout, there was no sound of birds or other wildlife. It was strange to explore such a large site, so completely devoid of life.

'Perhaps the most memorable thing about Upper Heyford was the size of the base. We spent a full day walking and driving around the compound, from the hangers and staff quarters, to store houses, watch towers, along the 8,300ft runway and through the command centres.

Sketches: Graffiti on the wall of the avionic building still remains long after the airmen who painted it have gone

Illuminated: This panel still is connected to the electricity supply in the mission control centre, twenty years after the base was last used by American forces

Artifacts: Compressed air cylinders in the base's bomb store. The base has appeared in several film and television productions, portraying various fictional military sites, including Octopussy, Lewis, and World War Z

Historical value: Water-cooled pipes inside a testing bay designed for test firing jet engines

Protection: Several of the hardened aircraft shelters were placed on the English Heritage list of scheduled monuments in 2010. A bid was made in 2011 for the site to receive World Heritage Site status but it did not make the UK shortlist

'As I walked around the base, I felt priviledged to be seeing inside the workings of such a large military installation.

'I would find myself imagining what the base had been like full of life, with aircraft moving between the hangers and the runways, and all the control centres filled with voices and ringing phones.'

The writing on the wall: It is clear that this building was once home to the base's bomb store

Storage: An aircraft hangar designed to house dozens of US fighter jets. B-52 bombers, U-2 aircraft and Phantoms all flew from the site

In working order: The intercom system at the base is still fully functioning, long after the base itself closed down

Instructions: An instruction panel telling aircrew which items of clothing they should remove and when should they be exposed to dangerous gases

All quiet: This mission control centre was once alive with the sound of voices and ringing telephones but is now eerily quiet
