Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar is desperate to end his injury struggles and reignite his season.

The Dutch skipper has just returned from over a month out with a thigh problem and had already been suffering with a calf injury this season.

He has made just nine appearances for Villa this term and has seen Ciaran Clark and Jores Okore form a solid partnership in defence.

But Vlaar returned to start in a back three with Clark and Okore for the 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Saturday.

The trio are expected to line up together at Swansea on Boxing Day and Vlaar is eager to finally cement himself back in the side.

'It's been a strange season - played a few games, injured, played a few games, injured,' said the Holland international.

'So let's hope I stay fit now. I believe in that. I trust in that.

'With the team it's going quite well to be honest. It's been hard to sit in the stands and watch the games when I've been injured but it's great to be back and it was good to play a full 90 minutes on Saturday.

The Dutch international admitted it has been difficult watching his side from the stands while injured 

'Let's push on now for more. It's too bad that we lost our unbeaten run against West Brom but let's hope we started it again on Saturday.

'Against United, we had some opportunities at the end. We were a little bit unlucky.

'We worked really hard. It was really good to be part of it. If we do that in every game, we will be hard to beat.

'I am used to the three-man defence. In the summer we did the same with the national team. We did it a few times last year too.'

Okore has returned this season after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury last term and Vlaar praised the Denmark international on his comeback.

'I think Jores and Ciaran are doing well. I have been pleased to see that, especially with Jores after his tough season last year with the big injury he had,' Vlaar told Villa's official site.

'He has now come back and he's a great player.

'It's not always been easy for Ciaran but I really think he stepped up and did great.

'I think I had to be lucky that the manager chose three central defenders.

'Everyone is pushing everyone else forward which is great for the team and will improve us.'
