How long can you expect to live, what are your marriage prospects and how healthy are you?

The answers to these questions lie hidden behind the six or seven-digit code at the end of your address.

Forty years after every town and city in the UK was allocated its own postcode, a new study commissioned by Royal Mail, today gives a detailed insight into everyday life in communities across the country.

The research examined five key areas - health and wellbeing, work, the cost of living, safety and security and home life.

What does your postcode say about you? A new study by Royal Mail reveals a snapshot of daily life in communities across the UK

Does your postcode begin with IP15? If so then you will be a resident of the charming Suffolk coastal town of Aldeburgh.

It is known for its music festivals, fish and chips and being the home of composer Sir Benjamin Britten.

But what you might not know, is that it is the postcode with the oldest average population in Britain, with locals typically aged just over 55 years old.

At the other end of the age spectrum, the university city of Birmingham harbours the postcode district with the youngest average age.

The city's B4 postcode area, covering part of the city centre and Aston University, has an average age of 23.

The study reveals London has the five healthiest areas in England - with the exclusive SW1X area of Knightsbridge taking top spot.

Researchers looked at all aspects of health, from general health to death rates, hospital stays and A&E attendances.

The postcode EC2V stretching from London's St Paul's cathedral to Bank is ranked the second healthiest spot with parts of Kensington, Chelsea and the Barbican completing the top five.

Outside London, Hampshire has the two healthiest postcode areas - Fleet (GU52) and Hook (RG27).

In Scotland, the top three healthiest postcode sectors are in Dumfries and Galloway.

They are Langholm (DG13), Gretna (DG16) and Canonbie (DG14), followed by Edinburgh (EH9) and then the PA72 postcode sector representing Argyll and Bute.

In Wales the healthiest spot is Cynderwen in Dyfed (SA66) and in Northern Ireland it is Hillsborough (BT26).

Meanwhile those people living in Poole are more likely to be married than those living anywhere else in the UK.

Of those with the BH18 postcode, around two-thirds are married.

Canterbury
 in Kent (CT1-CT6) has the lowest birth rate in Britain, with just under
 44 births for every 1,000 women aged between 16 and 44.

The highest is in Barking (RM5-RM10), with 90 births for every 1,000 women in this age group.

Those living in the Suffolk coastal town of Aldeburgh can expect to enjoy a long and happy life, with the postcode IP15 revealed as being home to those with the highest average age in the country

The exclusive address of Cadogan Square in London's Knightsbridge is the healthiest area of the UK, according to a new study commissioned by Royal Mail to mark the 40th anniversary of the towns and cities across the country being allocated postcodes

The postcode of B4 covering part of central Birmingham is the area in the UK with the lowest average age

The people of Worcester have the most cars, an average of 1.95 per household, according to the statistics from the Centre for Economic and Business Research.

Those in the Isles of Scilly have the fewest, typically one car for every ten homes.

The report reveals that outside London the biggest mortgage debt is in Surrey’s exclusive Virginia Water (GU25), typically at around £50,000 per person.

The place with the highest mortgage debt is the City of London (EC4A).

Mostly a business area, it includes some hugely expensive residential homes and has an average mortgage debt of £112,000 per person.

Postcode sectors in the City of London, 
Coldstream in Northumberland and the Isle of Islay, Scotland, have some 
highest average personal loan values in the UK.

Somerton and Frome in the West Country have the lowest unemployment rates in the UK, while Birmingham has the top ranked postcode sector outside London for highest qualified residents.Northumberland and West Cumbria have the lowest crime rates in England. In Scotland it is Shetland (ZE2), in Wales it is Clarbeston Road in Dyfed (SA63) and in Northern Ireland it is Craigavon (BT67).

Postcodes were first tested in Norwich in 1959, but it was not until 1974 that all parts of the country had their own.

Two-thirds of those people living in the BH18 postcode area of Poole in Dorset are married - the highest in England

The town of Coldstream on the Scottish borders, Northumberland has the lowest crime rate of any postcode across the UK

The Canterbury postcodes have the lowest birthrate of any in the country

In 1959 the first postcodes were trialled in Norwich.

The need came as Royal Mail started a major mechanism programme designed to use machines to overcome the problems of labour intensive letter sorting. 

This depended on reducing the address to a machine-readable code. 

In 1966, the eight-year programme to postcode the whole country began. 

This was completed in 1974 with the recoding of Norwich.

There are around 1.8 million postcodes in use today across the UK. 

The use of the postcode has evolved over the years and has now become much more than a tool for driving Royal Mail delivery. 

The Postcode Address File (PAF), managed by Royal Mail’s Address Management Unit, contains details of all 29 million UK delivery points. 

It is used by tens of thousands of organisations and businesses every day to update databases, confirm identities, prevent fraud and support new satellite navigation and location solutions.

In total, there are 48 million postcodes available under Royal Mail’s alpha-numeric systemThe combination of letters and numbers was chosen because people can remember a mixture of numbers and letters more easily than a list of numbers and it gives more code combinations.

Optical recognition machines read the postcodes and automatically convert them to phosphor dots. These are in turn read by the sorting machines which handle correctly addressed mail, post-coded letters 20 times faster than manual sorting.

On average one postcode covers 17 residential addresses.

Royal Mail’s online Postcode Finder is one of the UK’s most used webpages with around 100,000 visits a day – more than 40 million a year.
