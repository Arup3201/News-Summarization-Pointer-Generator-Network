Jos Buttler produced one of the great one-day innings at Lord’s on Saturday but it was not quite enough for England to pull off their highest successful one-day international run chase on home soil and clinch their first series triumph under new management in glorious fashion.

Instead, Sri Lanka pulled this fourth one-day international out of the fire in a thrilling finish to level a 50-over series of extremes at 2-2 with just Tuesday’s game at  Edgbaston to come.

It looked certain that England were stumbling towards a heavy defeat in this Royal London series when they crashed to 111-5 in search of 301 to win with fewer than 22 overs remaining.

Stepping up: Jos Buttler top scored for England during the fourth ODI against Sri Lanka

Inaugural: It was his maiden ODI century for his country

Flipper: Just like in the last game, Alistair Cook won the toss and elected to field

Opener: Tillakartne Dilshan (left) opened the batting for Sri Lanka before going on to score 71

Star man: Kumar Sangakkara was the key man for the tourists, scoring 112 off of just 104 balls

Nabbed: But he was eventually stumped out by wicketkeeper Jos Buttler after 158 minutes at the crease

Yet Buttler, first in company with 
Ravi Bopara and then with Chris Jordan, went so close to upsetting all 
the odds with a brilliant 121 off only 74 balls, the fastest one-day 
international hundred in Lord’s history, as England fell agonisingly 
short of an historic triumph.

‘That
 was a hell of an innings and Jos doesn’t deserve to be on the losing 
side,’ said England captain Alastair Cook after Sri Lanka’s nail-biting 
victory. ‘It was certainly one of the best innings I’ve seen. I wish I 
could play like that.’

Somehow
 Buttler, with his extraordinary array of shots and improvisation, got 
the target down to 92 off the last 10 and then 12 off the last over 
handed to one of the best death bowlers in the world in Lasith Malinga. 
Buttler’s hundred came off just 61 balls, the fastest by an Englishman 
anywhere, but heartbreakingly for England it was to prove in a losing 
cause.

The experience and 
nous of  Malinga was ultimately just too much for England, Buttler being
 run out trying to scramble a single from a perfect yorker in the  
middle of the final over, as Sri Lanka won a quite incredible game of 
cricket by seven runs.

There
 was little sign of the drama to come on a day when England had earlier 
displayed many of the shortcomings that have long bedevilled their 
one-day cricket.

If England 
thought that Sri Lanka would be shellshocked after being blasted out for
 67 in Manchester then they were to be disappointed as the application 
the tourists displayed in Durham returned after they had been inserted 
by Cook.Their formidable total was based around the class of Kumar  
Sangakkara and Tillekeratne Dilshan, two Sri Lankan veterans with a 
staggering 652 one-day international appearances between them, who knew 
precisely how to build a 50-over partnership in favourable conditions.

Sangakkara
 moved through the gears towards his first hundred at Lord’s in his 
long, distinguished career while Dilshan became a little bogged down 
before he was bowled by Jimmy Anderson attempting one scoop too many.

Once
 the pair had added 172 for the second wicket, England were sure to be 
facing a big target but they did peg Sri Lanka back as they ended their 
innings on 300-9 when 330 had looked probable.

Harry
 Gurney, with four wickets, was the pick of the England attack but 
England ultimately paid a heavy price for settling for containment 
rather than trying to be penetrative while Sri Lanka were setting out 
their stall.

England have 
never successfully chased 300 in a home one-day international — they 
have done it twice away — and they certainly did not look like ending 
that record when Cook and Ian Bell had fallen with only 10 on the board 
to the enduring brilliance of Malinga.

From
 there the England innings initially subsided into a predictably meek 
affair, with their batsmen both failing to reach the boundary often 
enough and also struggling to read the mystery spin of Sachithra 
Senanayake and Ajantha Mendis.

Resistance: Joe Root made 43 for England off of 68 balls

Coming together: Root colliding with Tillakaratne Dilshan whilst chasing a run

At
 one stage England went a staggering 130 balls without a boundary as 
they looked outdated and under-strength — until their innings was turned
 on its head once  Morgan was fifth man out with almost 200 still 
needed.

England believe 
their top order can adapt to any one-day conditions and that they do not
 need the explosive hitting of Alex Hales, but the methods of their top 
four will only take them so far when they play on surfaces like this at 
the World Cup in Australia next year.

It
 was only when Buttler joined forces with Bopara that England had any 
invention and energy in their batting, with the brilliant batsman-keeper
 finding the gaps and the power that had eluded Gary Ballance and Joe 
Root.

The longer their 
partnership went on the more that Sri Lanka’s nerve ends became frayed. 
Bopara may have played the supporting role in his stand of 133 off 16.2 
overs with Buttler but his running between the wickets had been 
brilliant and he could not believe it when he top-edged an attempted 
sweep off Mendis.

When the 
dust settles England will remember the best demonstration yet of 
Buttler’s supreme talent rather than the disappointment of falling short
 here. ‘I just tried to have a bit of fun out there,’ said Buttler. It 
was certainly fun while it lasted.
