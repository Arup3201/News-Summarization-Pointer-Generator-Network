A former singer last night claimed she had a relationship with Jimmy Savile that spanned almost two decades - and even secretly aborted his baby.

Donna Foot, 50, of Leatherhead, Surrey, said they had a secret fling after the late Top of the Pops presenter flattered her outside BBC studios - but she had no idea that he was a paedophile.

The mother of two revealed she felt physically sick to remember how she had almost given birth to Savile’s love child - and was pleased she eventually went through with the abortion.

She said: ‘I'm absolutely disgusted, as you can imagine. He was a total conman, he conned everyone. Now I'm thinking “you should have picked up on it”. I'm disgusted. I feel betrayed.’

Mrs Foot, who claimed to have had a 17-year relationship with Savile, added that she was ‘so glad’ she didn’t give birth to his child ‘because they would have to be dealing with all his shame now’.

She also chillingly claimed Savile that told her that he would never marry or have any sons or daughters because ‘the best thing about other people’s children is that you can give them back’.

Mrs Foot told how she had met Savile outside BBC Radio One in the early 1980s, while she was waiting for singer Cliff Richard - only to bump into the famous DJ on his way to work.

She had written to Savile as an eight-year-old for his Jim'll Fixit Show and admits she was instantly enamoured upon meeting him while in her early 20s, after noticing him on the way into Radio One.

Mrs Foot said: ‘He started saying to me “Blondie, Blondie - give me your hand”. I said that I was waiting to see Cliff Richard and he said “if you are here when I come out, I will get you a poster”.

‘I was there when he came back and he said "I'm going up to my apartment" and asked me to go. I couldn't believe it was true. We went to the apartment and he wanted to take my number.

‘He was asking about my singing and was 
saying he could help me. He was talking about Cilla Black and he said he
was in with Tom Jones. I was on cloud nine. I was star struck.’

'I'm absolutely disgusted, as you can imagine. He was a total conman, he conned everyone. Now I'm thinking “you should have picked up on it”. I'm disgusted. I feel betrayed'

She claimed Savile said he would take her to ‘sit on the bean bags’ at the Jim'll Fix It studio, and arranged for them to meet again at his flat, before they took a taxi to the BBC.

Mrs Foot said that when she visited the studio, Savile would make her give code words to get past security guards and would not want to pose for photographs with her.

She claimed he would call her ‘Do-Do’, and signed memorabilia from his radio and TV shows for her but banned her from telling people about their courtship.

Mrs Foot said that she now wanted to burn all of her signed items and her only remaining photograph of the pair together which was taken on the day that she first met Savile.

Today: Mrs Foot, 50, is a mother-of-two married to her husband Nigel and lives in Leatherhead, Surrey

‘When I think back he was very flirty with all the girls,’ she said. ‘There wasn't one girl who went past without him getting hold of them or kissing him, and would act like he wanted to go further.

‘He would always kiss my hand and when he got hold of you he would push his groin into you.’

'He would get me on the bed, he would look me in the eye - eye contact was the first thing - then he would put his hand on my leg and started rubbing me'

She later became intimate with Savile - with their relationship lasting until 1999. Mrs Foot said she had even become pregnant by Savile in 1999 but had aborted the child without telling him.

Their relationship ended soon after, she said. Mrs Foot, now married to husband Nigel, said she had been seeing another man alongside Savile at that point but that the baby could only have been his.

’I fell pregnant, and I worked out the dates,’ she said. ‘I was 10 weeks pregnant at that time. I would go to his apartment and there was a wardrobe where he showed me his colourful jackets.

‘I thought it was a wardrobe, but it was really a bed that came down. He would get me on the bed, he would look me in the eye - eye contact was the first thing - then he would put his hand on my leg and started rubbing me.’

She added: ‘The ones I feel sorry for are the children. I could always walk away, I could walk out of his place - but if you are subjected to that as a child there is nothing you can do.’
