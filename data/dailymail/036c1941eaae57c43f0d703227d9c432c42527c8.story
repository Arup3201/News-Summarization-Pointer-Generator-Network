Today marks the beginning of London Fashion Week and, with it, the world's most recognisable models are descending on the capital to strut down the catwalks in designer duds.

Most have just arrived after wrapping up New York Fashion Week and, following London, many models will head to Milan and Paris to continue their whirlwind high-fashion tour.

So, how exactly do the world's most beautiful women stay looking - and feeling - good, even with such hectic travel schedules?

British supermodel, Zoe Huxford, 18, shares her top travel tips for a hectic Fashion Week schedule

To find out, MailOnline Travel spoke to ELITE London's model of the moment, Zoe Huxford, to learn more about how she manages her jet-setting lifestyle.

The 18-year-old British beauty may be young, but she's already walked for the likes of Prada, Victoria Beckham, DKNY and Ralph Lauren, and has recently been named the face of Preen eyewear.

Following a successful New York Fashion Week run, we caught up with Huxford to quiz her on her travel must haves, on-the-go beauty secrets and her favourite places to visit in between runway shows.

This past week, Zoe walked in the 3.1 Phillip Lim New York Fashion Week show in New York City

She also worked the catwalk for Ralph Lauren's F/W 15 show (left) and Prada's S/S 15 collection (right)

Dry plane air can wreak havoc on your skin, so to ensure you disembark looking fresh, Huxford recommends using moisturising beauty products and drinking lots of water.

'Lip balm and water are essential,' she says. 'You become so dehydrated otherwise and I hate feeling dry. [My travel must haves] are anything that will replenish and moisturise.'  

And forget chowing down on airline meals.

'I always take my own food on the plane because I think airline food is atrocious,' Huxford says. 'Nuts and fruit, usually.'

Packing light - especially when it comes to hand luggage - is key to quickly heading to fittings upon arrival

Because they are often whisked off to a fitting upon landing, supermodels have mastered the art of packing light.

What's in Huxford's hand luggage? 'Not much,' she admits. 'Purse, keys, phone - anything else is extra.'

Unfortunately, though they travel the world regularly, sight-seeing is simply not in the cards for these top models.

Huxford may have just spent a week in the Big Apple, but admits that she really hasn't really seen much of it outside of the Lincoln Center tents.

She doesn't have time to do much sight-seeing, but Zoe admits that she'd love to visit Rockefeller Center

The British beauty was caught in a candid moment on the chilly New York streets just last week

During NYFW, Zoe did manage to find time to grab a bite to eat with a friend at the Empire Diner in Chelsea

'I want to go to Rockefeller Center,' she says. 'But I haven't really had time to explore.

'My friend did take me to Empire Diner though on 10th Avenue between 22nd and 23rd Streets. It was lovely.'

And in her native London?

'I think the best places to visit are Hoxton, Haggerston and Islington. They're not touristy, so you get good vibes of how real people actually live.'

Fellow ELITE London model, Kendall Jenner, has also posted many travelling snaps on Instagram

Like fellow top model Kendall, Milan holds fond memories for Zoe, who walked in the Prada S/S 2015 show

That's not to say Huxford doesn't look back fondly of her brief visits to New York, Paris and Milan.

'My favourite show that I've walked in was Prada in Milan,' she tells MailOnline Travel. 'It was such an honour.'

'The clothes were lovely and I particularly liked the makeup. The cat-eye flick was beautiful.'

But there's a time and a place to be comfortable and that especially holds true during long-haul flights.

'When I'm flying, I wholeheartedly dress for comfort,' she explains. 'If I know I've got a job [when I land], that's when I'll wear jeans. I like to stay warm and comfortable.'

'If I'm not working, I don't use makeup or products. I just let my skin breathe. And I've always got a big pair of glasses on!'
