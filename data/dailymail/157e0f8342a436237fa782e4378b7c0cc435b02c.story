The Pentagon said on
Thursday it is too early to say that the U.S.-led coalition is
'winning' against Islamic State, pointing to the group's
continued access to financing, volunteers and weapons even after
being bombed in Syria and Iraq.

'Your question gets at ... How do you know you're winning?
And what I'm telling you is, it's going to take us a while to be
able to say that,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby
told reporters.

'Even after the hits they've taken and they have been hit
... they still have financing at their fingertips. They still
have plenty of volunteers. They still have plenty of weapons and
vehicles and the ability to move around,' he said.

Ready for the long haul: Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby (L) speaks during a briefing at the Pentagon in Washington D.C. The United States and its allies are steeling themselves for what an American defense official described as a yearslong fight against the so-called Islamic State

U.S.-led airstrikes hit locations overnight in a remote area of eastern Syria where ISIS has been using mobile refineries to produce oil that brings in up to $2 million a day for the group

Earlier this week, U.S. aircraft, accompanied by planes from
Arab allies, began striking Islamic State targets in Syria,
marking an expansion of the U.S. air campaign against the
militant group that began last month in neighboring Iraq.

On Wednesday, the U.S. military announced strikes on small
oil refineries in eastern Syria intended to undermine the
group's ability to finance itself through oil sales.

Kirby said the United States had not seen movement of troops
loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who remains an
illegitimate leader in Western eyes, into areas of Syria where
Islamic State had been hit by U.S. and allied air strikes.

'We've also seen ... to be quite honest ... much in terms of
reaction by (Islamic State) inside Syria as a result of these
attacks. In other words, they're not seeing a lot of movement or
major muscle movement changes by them in just the last couple of
days.'

For now, the United States is focused on the refineries, according to Kirby. But he acknowledged there are 'other economic levers the international community is going to have to pull' to cut off all funding to ISIS

Kirby said U.S. officials were working to establish whether
civilians had been killed or injured in the recent strikes.

'We are aware of some reporting out there that there may
have been civilian casualties, and we're taking a look at that,'
he said.

'I would add, though, not as a caveat, but just to be
completely transparent, we don't have any credible operational
reporting through operational channels that would sustain those
allegations.'

In a Pentagon briefing yesterday, Army Lieutenant General Bill Mayville called the cruise missiles and bombs flung at targets in Syria 'the beginning of a credible and sustainable persistent campaign.' How long will the campaign last? 'I would think of it in terms of years,' Mayville responded.

Although the bombs exploded on Syrian soil, they didn't target Bashar al-Assad's battered, murderous regime. The bombs were addressed to Syria's enemy, the Islamic State, a nascent nation that has pledged to topple both Iraq and Syria, as well as Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Cyprus, and parts of southern Turkey, and erect a caliphate on the parcel.

But in attacking Syria's enemy, the United States wasn't looking to make friends with Syria. President Barack Obama called for Assad to step down in 2011, and it was only last year that the United States was prepared to bomb Syria for having crossed the chemical-weapons 'red line' to kill its own citizens. Not that the United States is remarkably choosey about which nations it counts among its allies. 

U.S. President Barack Obama and senior advisers meet with representatives from the five Arab countries plus Iraq who have participated in air strikes against ISIS in Syria

In the latest round of strikes targeting ISIS refineries in Syria, fighter jets from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates flew alongside U.S. aircraft, hitting 12 locations

Among the Middle East nations joining with the United States to strike Syria is Qatar, which has allowed one of its sheikhs to raise funds for an Al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. 

The United States is at war with Al Qaeda in all of its flavors, including the Syria-based Khorasan Group, upon which U.S. bombs fell this week. The Khorasan Group is said to be plotting attacks on the United States and Europe.

Our perpetual war is complicated, however, by the fact that the Islamic State is the sworn enemy of Al Qaeda, from which it split earlier this year because it couldn't play nice with Al Qaeda's other affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra, which is also fighting the Assad regime. Or, to look at it another way, the enemies of America's enemies are not automatically America's friends; and even America's friends, which can be permissive about the flow of money to Al Qaeda, aren't necessarily America's friends either.

America has allies in Syria's civil war, of course, including Harakat Hazm, part of the Free Syrian Army. Harakat Hazm is fighting Assad, but it has also fought alongside America's enemy Jabhat al-Nusra, which has not disqualified it from receiving U.S. weapons and training. 

Harakat Hazm took exception to the American-led bombing of Syria in a statement, calling it an 'external intervention' and 'an attack on the revolution,' according to a Los Angeles Times report. 

So Harakat Hazm, America's friend, which fought with America's enemy against Syria-which is neither friend nor enemy-objects to the fact that America bombed Syria in pursuit of the Islamic State, which is also Harakat Hazm's enemy. Meanwhile, the militant Shiite group Hezbollah is drone-bombing Jabat al-Nusrat along the Lebanon-Syria border at the same time Israel is downing Syrian jets.

 As Mayville promised, this conflict will likely go on for years.

The attacks are focused on the 'infrastructure around the refineries,' meaning the ability of ISIS to produce oil

There are questions about just how much impact the destruction of the refineries will have on ISIS, which analysts have said has access to billions of dollars

It's a wild card war in which allies and enemies seem arbitrary and ever-shifting. A war with a conclusion that its participants can't see or can't imagine is a war without end. None of the dig-in parties in Syria and Iraq look like pushovers, but neither do any of them look like sure bets. 

Without American intervention, the current war will likely rage on. With regard to American intervention, not even the Pentagon dares to predict an end.

For Americans, at least so far, this war is rumbling on like background noise. The usual markers of military victory-body-counts tabulated, territories seized and banked, no-fly zones established, governments-in-waiting imposed, and elections supervised-don't apply to the Syria war. 

The borders, combatants, allegiances, and military objectives in the Syrian war are too fluid to conform to our usual expectations.

 Nor do the usual markers of peace seem to exist. There are no peace talks taking shape, no shuttle diplomacy, no evidence of a dominant power about to exert its might to create a lasting peace by flattening everybody.

President Obama, who inherited this war, has made this war his war, the next president's war and for as far as the eye can see. Perpetual war for perpetual peace.
