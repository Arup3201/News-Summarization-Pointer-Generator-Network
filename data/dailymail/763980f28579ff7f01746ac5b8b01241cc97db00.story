A once-respected religious counselor in New York City‘s ultra-orthodox Jewish community has been sentenced to 103-years in prison for molesting a girl, beginning when she was 12-years old.

Nechemya Weberman, 54, who worked as an unlicensed therapist in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, showed no reaction to the judge's sentencing on Tuesday that followed an emotional testimony by his victim, now aged 18.

‘I clearly remember how I would look in the mirror. I saw a girl who didn’t want to live in her own skin, a girl whose innocence was shattered, a girl who couldn’t sleep at night because of the gruesome invasion that had been done to her body,’ the accuser told the court.

Sentenced: Nechemya Weberman, seen entering a Brooklyn courtroom on Tuesday, centre, was sentenced to 103-years in prison for molesting a young girl over the course of several years

She said she was ‘a sad girl who 
wanted to live a normal life but instead was being victimized by a 
50-year-old man who forced her to perform sickening acts again and 
again.’

She had testified that 
Weberman abused her repeatedly behind his locked office door from the 
time she was 12 until she was 15.

Weberman was convicted last month on all 
59 counts, including sustained sexual abuse of a child, endangering the 
welfare of a child and sexual abuse.

Secrets: Weberman was a religious counselor in New York City's ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn before found guilty in December

The trial put a spotlight on the ultra-orthodox community in Brooklyn and its strict rules that govern clothing, social customs and interaction with the outside world.

Both Weberman, 54, and the accuser belonged to the Satmar Hasidic sect.

The teen and her family have been harassed and ostracized, reflecting long-held beliefs that any conflict must be dealt with from within.

During the trial, men were arrested on charges they tried to bribe the accuser and her now-husband to drop the case.

Others were accused of snapping photos of her on the witness stand and posting them online.

She expressed hope that by coming forward, she could give strength to other victims of sexual abuse.

Her school had ordered her to see 
Weberman because she had been asking questions about her religion and 
was dressing immodestly in violation of the sect’s customs, and it was 
believed she needed to be helped back on the right path.

Locked away: The victim testified that from the time she was 12-years-old until she was 15 Weberman abused her behind his locked office door

Reaction: Like Weberman, his wife Chaya Golda Weberman, seen arriving at the Brooklyn Supreme Court on Tuesday, showed no emotion to his sentencing

Weberman wasn’t a licensed counselor but spent decades working with couples and families in his community.

There was no physical evidence of abuse.

The court received dozens of letters from supporters of the defendant who described his life in the community as a counselor and a father.

‘Nechemya Weberman is innocent of the crimes charged,’ defense attorney George Farkas insisted at the sentencing.

On Tuesday Weberman said ‘no thank 
you’ when asked if he wished to speak. He and his wife had no visible 
reaction to the sentence. The top charge carried a sentence of 25 years;
he got consecutive terms for some of the other charges.

The
defense argued that the girl was angry that Weberman had told her 
parents she had a boyfriend at the age of 15 which is forbidden in her 
community.

They claimed the girl went to police 
only after Weberman and her parents set up hidden cameras to secretly 
record the girl having sex with her boyfriend when she was still 
underage.

Weberman turned the tapes over to police in the hopes that the boyfriend would be prosecuted.

The charges against the boyfriend were later dropped.

Community support: Seen last May among other members of Williamsburg's community, the court received dozens of letters from his supporters who described his life in the community as a wholesome counselor and a father

Attorney Stacey Richman said the case boiled down to a simple ‘he said, she said,’ and the girl was a petulant, calculating liar.

‘The only evidence in this case of sexual abuse is the word of’ the accuser, Richman told jurors. ‘She’s making things up in front of you as they occur.’

Weberman's lawyers also claim that he had been business partners with the girl's parents and that the families had a falling out.

But the jury took just hours in December to convict Weberman on all counts.

The Satmar Hasidic community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, rallied around the rabbi - sponsoring fundraisers to pay for his legal defense.

The community numbers around 250,000 - the largest sect of its type outside of Israel. The group has its own ambulances, 
volunteer police and rabbinical courts, and they are discouraged from 
going to secular authorities.

Weberman's supporters were so protective of him they disrupted the course of the trial when they allegedly photographed the accuser during her testimony.

Four men were led out of a New York court room and arrested in late November after jumping up to take pictures of her on their phones while she gave evidence.

Each was a  members of the strict Satmar sect in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, of which Rabbi Weberman is leader.

Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said he hoped the case would persuade other victims to come forward.

Hynes has been accused of overlooking crimes in the community because he was too cozy with powerful rabbis, a charge he vehemently denies.
