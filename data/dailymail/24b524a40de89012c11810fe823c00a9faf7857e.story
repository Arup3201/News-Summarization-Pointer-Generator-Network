The most bizarre twist in the Huhne saga came on a January night in 2013 when, by pure chance, a Mail on Sunday journalist learned for the first time of the extent of the police spying operation mounted against this newspaper.

The paper’s News Editor David Dillon – who had met both Huhne’s ex-wife Vicky Pryce and her friend, judge Constance Briscoe – was having a snack in the Stick and Bowl Chinese restaurant just yards from our offices in Kensington, West London at around 9.30pm.

He didn’t pay much attention when a well-dressed blonde woman in her 40s sat down next to him at one of the communal tables in the tiny diner.

Having ordered food, she opened a file of papers which consisted of a series of spreadsheets. Dillon happened to glance across – and to his astonishment, saw his own name jumping out at him, alongside his mobile phone number.

Then he noticed the names of Pryce, Briscoe and our original source, freelance journalist Andrew Alderson, who the MoS had mounted a £150,000 legal battle to keep anonymous.

The spreadsheet was entitled: ‘Kent Police. Operation Solar Chronological telephone data.’ 

One column gave the duration of calls and other columns the numbers and the names.

Mystified as to how the woman could have obtained confidential information, Dillon asked her if she was a journalist.

The woman said she was not a journalist, nor a police officer.

Dillon, 48, recalled: ‘She then asked me why I was asking and I told her that I had seen my name on the paperwork. 

'She became very flustered and prepared to leave even though her meal had only just arrived. As she stood I asked her if she was a lawyer and she said, “I am Chris Huhne’s lawyer,” adding, “You must be David Dillon” then she hurried out. She seemed embarrassed.’

The diner was later identified as Jane Glass, a partner of law firm Burton Copeland.
