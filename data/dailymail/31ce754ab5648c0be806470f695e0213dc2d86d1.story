At least 15 people have been killed and dozens injured after the Taliban carried out two suicide bomb attacks in Afghanistan with minutes of Ashraf Ghani being sworn in as the new president.

In the country's first ever democratic transfer of power - which took place after six months of bitter dispute and rows over electoral fraud - Ghani was sworn in as president.

At a handover ceremony in the country's capital Kabul, Ghani formally replaced predecessor Hamid Karzai, who came into office following the 2001 U.S.-led invasion to topple the Taliban.

But within minutes of Ghani taking the presidential oath, two bomb attacks left 15 people dead - the first at Kabul airport killing seven, before a second attack in Paktia province killed eight.

Shortly after the attacks took place, the Taliban claimed responsibility for them, having earlier described the election as a U.S.-orchestrated sham.

The first bomb blast this morning - a possible assassination attempt on the new president - took place on the on the road connecting the country's main airport with the presidential palace.

The roadside bomb did not result in any deaths or injuries, but a second attack about half a mile along the same road - this time by a suicide bomber - killed seven people near Kabul airport.

A bigger attack then took place in the eastern Paktia province, with Police Captain Mohammed Hekhlas saying a car bomb exploded near a government compound as gunmen attacked, killing eight people, including at least four police officers.

The second attack sparked a gun battle in which seven Taliban militants died.  

The violence and insecurity remained one of the top concerns of Afghans watching the inauguration.

'I hope Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai can bring peace and the rule the law in Afghanistan as former Afghan President Hamid Karzai could not bring peace,' said Abdul Rahman, a 30-year-old police officer. 'Our people have been suffering from the instability and poverty.'

The attacks took place within minutes of the swearing-in ceremony, which a senior adviser to President Barack Obama said would allow Kabul to immediately sign a long-awaited security pact permitting U.S. forces to remain in the country past the end of the year.

Moments after Ghani took the oath, he swore in his election challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, as chief executive, fulfilling a political pledge he had taken to share power and defuse election tensions that had threatened to spark violence between the country's north and southeast.

In his first speech, conducted as the suicide bomb attacks were carried out, Ghani called on the Taliban and other militants to join the country's political process and lay down their weapons.

'We are tired of war,' he said in a televised address. 'Our message is peace, [but] this doesn't mean we are weak.'

Ghani, a former World Bank official and Afghan finance minister, wore a dark black turban popular in the country's south as he swore in his two vice presidents and then Abdullah.

Abdullah, a former foreign minister, spoke first and thanked Karzai for his service and the people of the country for casting votes in the millions despite the threat of attack from Taliban militants who tried to thwart the election process.

'We are committed as one in the national unity government,' Abdullah said. 'Our commitment will be fulfilled together as unified team to create national unity.'

Ghani then congratulated Karzai for a peaceful and democratic transition of power, and he thanked Abdullah for making the national unity government possible. 

The new president also promised to confront the country's endemic corruption.

'We want to be held accountable. I am your leader but I am no better than you. If I make mistakes, you should hold me accountable,' Ghani said.

The change in presidents will allow Afghanistan to sign a deal to allow American soldiers to remain in the country past the end of the year, according to John Podesta, a senior adviser to Obama. 

U.S. Ambassador James Cunningham is scheduled to sign the agreement, while it was not immediately clear if Ghani or a lower member of his government would provide the Afghan signature.

The deal will allow about 10,000 American troops to stay in the country after the international combat mission ends December. 31. Karzai had refused to sign it despite U.S. threats of a full withdrawal in the absence of legal protections for American forces.

U.S. officials have said that the delay in the deal's signing does not affect plans for next year.

Karzai - the only president Afghanistan and the West have known since the invasion - wore a wide smile as he greeted his presidential guards upon entering the palace.

Karzai has said he is glad to be stepping down after more than a decade of what the U.S. ambassador recently said was one of the most difficult jobs in the world.

The inauguration caps a nearly six-month election season that began when ballots were first cast in April. 

A runoff election in June between Ghani and Abdullah stretched on for weeks as both sides leveled charges of fraud.

The United Nations helped carry out what it said was the most thorough recount in its history, a count that reduced Ghani's vote percentage from 56 per cent to 55 per cent, but still gave him the win.

But the real power struggle took place in marathon talks between the two sides, often brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and other U.S. officials. The political deal they agreed to created the new position of chief executive that Abdullah will now fill.
