She was a little off the mark. 

Angry locals on the New South Wales south coast have laid into  Kim Kardashian-West after the star made an Australian geography fail.

Kim snapped a picture of a Jervis Bay beach at a fashion shoot this week. 

She captioned the picture 'Sydney'. But she was actually around 200km, or three hours drive, south of the metropolis. 

The point wasn't lost on many residents and social media users.

Bombshell: Kim Kardashian is currently in Australia to mark the launch of a new perfume

Controversial picture: Many Instagram users hastily moved to correct Kim Kardashian after she described this Jervis Bay beach as 'Sydney'

Long way to go: Jervis Bay is nearly 200km south of Sydney

'Wrong place @kimkardashian!' Social media users correct the star

Kim Kardashian and her entourage took to Hole in the Wall Beach at the southern end of Jervis Bay 

Instagram user @michalafarrell let fly: 'Wow @kimkardashian at least get it right. Jervis Bay is NOT Sydney'.

@kirstylee984 added: 'Not even close! When "promoting" please get the place right". 

Local Australian football player Adam Federici tweeted a pointed correction: 'Jervis Bay!! Not Sydney #hometown,' along with a red-faced, angry emoticon.  

A resident with apparent deep ties to the area, @kewanaparsons, added: 'As a traditional owner of the area in this photo, this is not Sydney'. 

The star had taken to the Hole in the Wall Beach in Booderee National Park in the bay's south for a fashion shoot.

Shoalhaven Tourism manager Steve Lawson told Daily Mail Australia proud locals were probably 'a little bit disappointed she didn't quite realise where she was.'

Kim Kardashian has visited Australia solo - without her daughter North West

Tourism officials told Daily Mail Australia it was the 'perfect place' for a fashion shoot featuring crystal blue waters 

Kim's make-up and wardrobe were stored in a white tent set up in nearby bush

'I feel for her a little,' Mr Lawson said. 

'She was obviously a little confused, probably a little bit jetlagged.' 

He added that Kim's team had selected the best spot on the South Coast for crystal blue water scenes.

'We don't have the Opera House or the Harbour Bridge but we do have the whitest sand in the world,' Mr Lawson said. 

At time of publication, Kim's wrongly labelled picture had secured more than half a million likes on Instagram and nearly 5000 comments. 

Local beachgoers were moved on from Kim's beach during her shoot, the local South Coast Register newspaper reported. 

A tent was erected in the bush for Kim's privacy, and several police and photographers were seen milling around on the sand. 

Local mayor Joanna Gash told Daily Mail Australia her visit was a positive development.

'She obviously enjoyed her stay and that's what matters,' she said.

The social media queen visited Australia to celebrate the launch of her new perfume, Femme Fatale.

But ever the businesswoman, Kim made the most of every opportunity during her short visit to Australia.

The mega star went for dinner at high-end Sydney restaurant Icebergs Dining Room on Sunday night, just a few hours after touching down in the city.

Going solo: Kim is alone on this trip Down Under, after touring the country with husband Kanye West and one-year-old daughter North in September, when they visited Australia Zoo in Queensland

Unlike in September when she was here with husband Kanye West and their one-year-old daughter, North, the mega star is flying solo for this trip.

But rather than living it up, the reality star admitted she is missing her little girl. 

She posted a photo of herself crouching down to tend to North on Instagram, and captioned it: 'Helping my little lady out...just staring at pics of her and missing her.'

Her visit to Australia comes just days after Kim's nude cover for Paper magazine was released, and send social media into a frenzy but didn't quite 'break the internet', as the coverline read.  

Earlier this week, the LA-based star denied reports she was considering buying a Queensland island.
