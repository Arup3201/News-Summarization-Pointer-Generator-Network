Outspoken comic Frankie Boyle has called on the BBC to sack 'cultural tumour' Jeremy Clarkson.

Speaking at the Edinburgh festival, the Scottish comedian launched a stinging attack on the controversial Top Gear presenter.

Boyle - who has himself been cast out by some TV producers - said Clarkson only keeps his job because of his closeness to those in power.

Comedian Frankie Boyle has launched a stinging attack on  Jeremy Clarkson at the Edinburgh Festival, calling the Top Gear presenter a 'cultural tumour'

In comments reported in the Observer, Boyle said: 'He's a friend David Cameron... he's in there like a f****** growth and he should be removed because he's horrible. Sack him because he's a cultural tumour.'

Clarkson, 54, escaped dismissal in May despite being forced to issue a grovelling apology for apparently using the word 'n*****' during a Top Gear outtake.

Unused footage from car show emerged showing the £1million a year host swinging his finger between two cars while reciting a notoriously racist children's nursery rhyme.

Clarkson initially denied he used the word, but later issued a humiliating video message in which he said he was 'mortified' by the upset he had caused, and 'begged forgiveness' from his fans.

It came after he sparked outrage by making an apparently racist joke during another episode of the hit motoring show, screened in March.

While filming in Burma, he joked a bridge with an Asian man walking across it had a 'slope on it'.

Boyle, 42,  has himself attracted controversy in the past for making controversial jokes about Katie Price's disabled son and the appearance of Olympic swimming champion Rebecca Adlington.

But he insisted he did not regret his comments, saying: 'Think of all the other things that we could get offended about rather than a joke that was told five years ago.'

Boyle has attracted criticism from some TV bosses, with Channel 4's Head of Comedy Phil Clarke claiming the Glaswegian would not be returning to the channel in an interview earlier this year.

Boyle hit back at producers in his on-stage rant in Edinburgh, claiming: 'There's a layer of people whose job it is to kind of reject things that are interesting. And the trouble is, that layer is at the top.'

He added that current TV guides look like 'the entertainment programme on a f****** cruise ship'.

In a further outburst, he claimed the BBC 'is biased against' Scottish independence because it is worried about a drop in licence fee revenue.

Asked about the aftermath of a No vote, he said: 'I think half the country will have had their dreams and hopes destroyed, so it will be pretty much business as usual for everybody.'
