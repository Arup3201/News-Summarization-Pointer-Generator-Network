Lewis Hamilton has hailed the past two years as the best of his life after concluding two days of celebrations with everyone at Mercedes following their success in winning the Formula One constructors' title.

The team, primarily based in Brackley, with the power-unit department 28 miles away in Brixworth, has been savouring the fruits of five years of hard work since Mercedes bought out Brawn GP at the end of 2009.

The team's ninth one-two of the season in Russia on Sunday - one shy of McLaren's 1988 record - and spearheaded by Hamilton's ninth win this campaign, ensured Mercedes became champions in style for the first time in F1 history.

Hamilton, who opted to end his long association with McLaren and join Mercedes at the start of 2013, was initially left speechless as he addressed the workforce.

The 29-year-old then said: 'What an incredible feeling it is to be stood in front of all these incredible people.

'You almost have to take a step back and just think about what we've achieved together.

'I know it's been a long road and many of the team have had to work through tough times to lay the foundations for what we're seeing today, and I'm incredibly grateful for all of their hard work.

'These past two years have been the best of my life - and that's all down to everybody standing here.

'The effort and the synergy here is unlike anything I've ever seen and I'm excited for the future.'

The short-term aim, though, is now the drivers' crown, with Hamilton 17 points clear of Rosberg following a dramatic turnaround in results over the past four races.

At least the party atmosphere diverted the attentions of both drivers from their primary goal for a short period.

Rosberg, who has been with Mercedes since they first returned to the sport in 2010, said: "So this is it - we're actually standing here now as world champions!

'This has been a long time coming. Since I joined at the start of this project I expected this day to come as I've had such strong belief in this group of people from right back on day one.

'To be a part of that and to have finally achieved this championship in such dominant fashion is a great feeling.

Hamilton says he is enjoying the best years of his life as part of the Mercedes team he joined two years ago

'I'd like to say a big thank you to everyone for all their hard work.

'I hope they can really enjoy this moment, that there will be many more great moments to come and that this is just the beginning of a long era of success for the Silver Arrows.'

Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff rightly acknowledged the work done by Ross Brawn as it was he who set the ball rolling.

Following their double triumph in 2009, it was Brawn's team Mercedes bought out, and then it was he who led a recruitment drive to ensure the marque had the right personnel in place to become champions.

Brawn, though, was forced out at the end of last year, but in paying tribute, Wolff said: 'Winning the first constructors' championship for Mercedes-Benz is a moment of immense pride for all of us.

'This is the moment to recognise everybody involved in that team effort - starting with Ross Brawn, who was an inspiring figure at the team and laid the foundations for our current success.

'I thank each and every one of these great people for their involvement in what we have achieved and raise a toast to their efforts - the best of the best.'

Non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, meanwhile, knows the real hard work has only just started as the team set their sights on repeating such success again and again.

'We have three more races and we must keep on pushing to make sure our drivers have an equal chance to win their title,' said Lauda.

'Then we must push even harder to keep winning year after year - and it will only get tougher, but I believe we have the people to do that.'
