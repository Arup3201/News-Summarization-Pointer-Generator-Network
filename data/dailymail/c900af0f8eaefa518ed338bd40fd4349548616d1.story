Millions of homeowners were last night warned to get ready for interest rate rises by the end of the year and the introduction of a cap on mortgage lending.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney indicated that the first hike in rates for seven years is closer than expected – and is now likely to take place within months.

And Chancellor George Osborne, announced the Bank is being given new powers to order a cap on the ratio of mortgage loans compared to borrowers’ incomes or to the value of their house.

Speech: George Osborne announced new powers to cap mortgage loans in the Mansion House speech

Rate: The cap is believed to be between three and three-and-a-half the borrower's salary

The cap is widely expected to be between three and three-and-a-half times the borrower’s salary.

As well as acting as an impediment to first-time buyers, the restrictions could affect many of those seeking to remortgage or move house.

The interest rate rise is a further blow but Mr Carney tried to reassure anxious homeowners by making clear that interest rate rises will be ‘gradual and limited’ when they do begin.

But he pointed out the base rate, frozen at an historic low of 0.5 per cent since March 2009, is expected by economists to rise to 2.25 per cent over the next three years.

Mr Carney said: ‘There is already great speculation about the exact timing of the first rate hike. It could happen sooner than markets currently expect.’

The Treasury and the Bank are keen to 
be seen to be alive to the potential risks of a housing bubble, though 
Mr Osborne insisted last night there was no evidence that rising prices 
yet posed any danger.

‘House
 prices are still lower in real terms than they were in 2007 – and are 
forecast to stay below that peak for some years to come,’ the Chancellor
 said in his annual Mansion House speech.

‘So there is no immediate cause for alarm. Indeed the most recent data shows that mortgage approvals have actually slowed.’

However, Mr Osborne said ‘causes for concern’ were ‘on the horizon’, adding: ‘If London prices were to continue growing at these rates, that would be too fast for comfort.

‘Let me spell it out: Does the housing market pose an immediate threat to financial stability today? No, it doesn’t. Could it in the future? Yes, it could, especially if we don’t learn the lessons of the past.’

Mr Osborne dismissed accusations from Lib Dems that he is prepared to risk a housing bubble to fuel a feel-good factor and boost Tory chances at next year’s general election.

‘I’m not going to opt for the easy route of some of my recent predecessors: duck the issues, risk a housing boom, and keep my fingers crossed that it won’t damage the economy,’ he said. The only long-term solution to rising house prices, he said, was to build more homes.

He set a target of 200,000 a year. He said councils would be forced to put in place pre-approved planning permissions on brownfield sites, saving developers time and money.  

The Chancellor also announced that the 
Government would change the law to dramatically increase the Bank’s 
powers over mortgage lending.

‘I want to make sure that the Bank of England has all the weapons it needs to guard against risks in the housing market. So today, I am giving the Bank new powers over mortgages, including over the size of mortgage loans as a share of family incomes or the value of the house,’ Mr Osborne said.

‘In other words, if the Bank of England thinks some borrowers are being offered excessive amounts of debt, they can limit the proportion of high loan to income mortgages each bank can lend, or even ban all new lending above a specific loan to income ratio.

'And if they really think a dangerous housing bubble is developing, they will be able to impose similar caps on loan to value ratios.’

Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was ‘appalled’ that banks were offering mortgages worth up to five times borrowers’ salaries – and indicated he believed a stable level was ‘three or three and a half times’.

Such a limit would render homes unaffordable for most people in much of southern England.

The Resolution Foundation think tank estimates that roughly 3.4million households with mortgages – around 38 per cent of the total have outstanding mortgages worth more than three times their net household income.

Next week, senior executives at the Bank are due to meet to discuss potential action to control Britain’s booming housing market.

Options include forcing borrowers to put down new minimum  deposits, such as 20 per cent, restricting loans which are more than four times a person’s salary and longer-life mortgages, such as 35-year loans.
