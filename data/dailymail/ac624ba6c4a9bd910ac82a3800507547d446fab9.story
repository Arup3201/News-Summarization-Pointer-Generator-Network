With his fondness for a drink or two, a wicked way with the ladies and a relentlessly mischievous nature, Prince Harry's playboy ways have earned 
him countless headlines over the years.

Just this week, his riotous five day trip to Las Vegas culminated with nude photos splashed across the internet - and no doubt a severe drubbing from his grandmother after he returned, fully-clothed and sheepish to receive a dressing down from his press secretary at Clarence House this morning.

Now, in honour of the fun-loving prince's safe return to the fold, thanks to spoof photographer Alison Jackson, MailOnline can reveal how similar scenes might have played out if Harry's conduct on his earlier foreign trips this year had matched that of his week in Sin City.

Up to his tricks again? Spoof clips of Prince Harry misbehaving while on tour have been created by photographer Alison Jackson

Truth is stranger than fiction: The images Jackson dreamed up turned out to be less outrageous than the real scenes played out in Vegas over the past week, when Harry was pictured cavorting naked in his hotel suite

Earlier in 2012 Prince Harry undertook an official tour on behalf of the Queen as part of her Jubilee celebrations, which took in Brazil and Jamaica.

By all accounts, the young royal made an excellent impression - charming dignitaries and locals alike - including large swathes of the female population who by all accounts lavished the eligible bachelor with attention.

But what would have happened if Harry had succumbed to the temptation to let his hair down, Vegas style, on those occasions?

Meeting the locals: Alison Jackson imagines how Prince Harry's official tours abroad could have gone if he'd truly let his hair down

As part of a new series starting tomorrow, Alison Jackson imagines the scenes... with hilarious results.

In one scene, filmed with impressive 
foresight way before the happenings in Vegas, Harry strips off his 
trousers to reveal Union flag boxer shorts before diving, still wearing 
the rest of his clothes, into a swimming pool.

In
another, he parties poolside with a gaggle of bikini-clad girls 
(sounding familiar?) before they corner him in a hammock and pour 
cocktails into his open mouth while he blows smoke rings after smoking 
what looks like a marijuana cigarette.

Doubletake: Jackson is famous for creating portraits of celebrities caught off guard in awkward situations using lookalikes

In a clip of what Jackson imagines could have been the sort of shenanigans that went on during his Brazil tour, Harry eyes are on stalks as a carnival dancer shakes her nipple tassels at him as she advances on the flustered prince.

For Alison Jackson, who usually imagines the most outrageous and unlikely scenes in which to portray her fake subjects, the irony cannot be lost that for once, the scenes she has come up with have been trumped soundly by the antics of the real Harry himself just one day before the clips were due for release.

Let's just hope the Queen realises they are fake before she takes her grandson to task again.
