This week I must admit I’ve been feeling the January blues a tad. Winter has hit London with full freezing force and I’m still pining after the sun, sand and sea from my trip to Mexico a few weeks ago.

To top it all off, my skin was really feeling the effects from soaking up all those Mexican rays. So to combat my dull, dehydrated complexion, I thought I’d treat myself to a facial at the Premier Laser Clinic in Fulham. 

I wanted a treatment that would refresh and clear my skin without the downtime of a peel, so I opted for the Vitamin C Rejuvenation Facial.

Binky has been feeling a bit down in the dumps lately so treated herself to a Vitamin C facial in order to perk herself and her skin up 

The Vitamin C facial exfoliates the outer layer of the skin by gently removing dead skin cells, leaving the complexion looking radiant and rejuvenated. 

It also targets the deeper levels of the dermis to promote skin cell renewal, overall resulting in a fresher, more youthful look.

I was lucky enough to be treated by the Premier Laser Clinic’s treatment director Lucy Xu, who has years of experience in skincare.

Lucy began by applying a retinol serum to my face, to tighten skin and boost collagen production. The serum is made up of a unique blend of vitamins A, C and E, which infuse the skin with its nourishing and anti-oxidising properties. It also includes hyaluronic acid, to hydrate the skin and reduce the appearance of blemishes.

After this, Lucy applied a mixture of botanical stem cells to my face to renew and revitalise the skin, as well as gently nourishing the delicate eye area.

While the mixture was left to penetrate the deep layers of my skin, I was treated to a pampering shoulder and scalp massage. It was so soothing I could almost feel myself drifting off at one point!

Finally, Lucy massaged a clarifying serum containing brightening Kojic extract into my skin, to leave it looking clear and refreshed.

After a highly relaxing 45 minutes, I checked my reflection out in the mirror and was thoroughly impressed. My skin looked bright, clear, and as the facial’s name promised, completely rejuvenated.

Lucy also prescribed me with a set of aftercare products from the Obagi 360 system range (their Exfoliating Cleanser, Retinol Serum and HydraFactor SPF moisturiser) to help me maintain my radiant glow by preventing pigmentation, dullness and breakouts.

Binky says that the facial is the perfect quick fix to a flawless complexion 

The Vitamin C facial is suitable for all ages and skin types – including dry, sensitive, mature and rosacea-prone skin – providing instant results that last for 6-8 weeks. One session costs £89 – book at londonpremierlaser.co.uk.

If your lacklustre skin is in dire need of a pick-me-up – or if you’ve got a big night out coming up and want a quick fix to a flawless complexion – I can’t recommend it enough!

That night I headed out to the Thomson Scene party with my fellow MIC castmates Lucy, Tiff and Proudlock. Thomson Scene is a new holiday offering for 18-35 year olds that love having chilled days and lively nights whilst away. 

The bar was set up into different ‘scenes’ which represented some of the ultra-glam destinations on offer such as Mykonos, Santorini and Ibiza and more exotic long-haul destinations like Goa, Mexico and Thailand.

Binky recently returned from sunny Mexico where she tried out the ultra-glam glitter lips trend

I kept my make-up minimal as I wanted to show off my glowy visage, but discovered these amazing Glitter Lips at the party which completely transformed my look!

You can easily create this look for yourself in three simple steps:

Step 1: PREP

Exfoliate your lips with a sugar scrub or toothbrush to get rid of any chapping or dry skin. This will encourage blood circulation in your lips too, making them appear plumper. Follow up with a non-greasy lip balm like DHC Lip Cream to give your pout a super-smooth, soft finish.

Step 2: COLOUR

Next it’s time to add your base lip colour. Opt for a product with a bold, matte finish to give the look optimum longevity. To recreate my vivid purple-pink look, sweep two layers of Too Faced Melted Liquified Long Wear Lipstick in Melted Violet over your lips.

Step 3: GLITTER

Now it’s time to get glitzy! Start by applying a slick of clear lipgloss like Guerlain Gloss d’Enfer in L’Oiseau De Feu over your pout to hold the glitter in place. Then gently pat a glitter pigment such as Too Faced Glamour Dust in Pink Fire all over your lips with your fingertip, focusing on the middle for fuller-looking smackers.

Finally, set your glittering pout in place with a spritz of Clarins Fix’ Make Up Spray to ensure your lips’ll be sparkling all through the night. You can get all the products above from Escentual.com.

Stay gorgeous,
