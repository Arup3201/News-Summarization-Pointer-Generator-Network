Rugby star Ian Gough was found guilty yesterday of attacking his beauty queen ex-girlfriend just days after she got engaged to pop star Dane Bowers.

Sophia Cahill said the 37-year-old Welsh international pushed her into the passenger door of his white VW converted campervan after he arrived late to drop off their son Gabriel, now aged two.

Giving evidence behind a curtain at Croydon Magistrates’ Court, Surrey, so she did not have to come face to face with her former boyfriend, Miss Cahill said she had become ‘really worried’ after the 6ft 5in lock forward was more than an hour late dropping off their son at her home.

Guilty: Ian Gough, 37, (pictured left arriving outside Croydon Magistrates’ Court, Surrey, yesterday) attacked ex-girlfriend Sophia Cahill, 30, (right) a former glamour model who was crowned Miss Wales in 2000,  in January

Model: Miss Cahill appeared naked and heavily pregnant on the catwalk at London Fashion Week in 2012

Gough, who plays for Newport Dragons, denied the charge and accused her of ‘swearing profusely’ at him and of punching the window and wing mirror of his van. He shook his head as the guilty verdict was delivered

When he arrived at 9.15pm, she went to the car and tried to reach in to get Gabriel out.

But,
 she claimed, Gough grabbed her and pushed her against the van. She told
 the court: ‘I went out to collect my son. It was raining so I went out 
to the van.

‘I expected Ian
 to get out but he was on his phone as if he was texting. There were no 
obvious signs he was going to get out. I opened the passenger door and 
Ian just stormed around the front of the van.’

She
 said that as she reached into the van, Gough grabbed her shoulder and 
pushed her. ‘He had the front of my shoulder and he just flung me back.’

Witness and victim: Former pop star Dane Bowers and Ms Cahill, pictured outside Croydon Magistrates' Court in south London, had got engaged shortly before the attack

Miss
 Cahill, who appeared naked and heavily pregnant on the catwalk at 
London Fashion Week in February 2012, said Gough told her: ‘Get away.’

'Did you just lay your f****** hands on Sophie?'

Dane Bowers

She said Gough took Gabriel out and silently handed him to Miss Cahill before driving off.

The
 model, who also has an older son, said she went into her South Croydon 
home in tears where Mr Bowers, to whom she had just got engaged, was 
waiting.

The former Another Level star sent a text to Gough saying: 'Did you just lay your f****** hands on Sophie?'

said: ‘He grabbed Sophie and moved her away from the car.’
