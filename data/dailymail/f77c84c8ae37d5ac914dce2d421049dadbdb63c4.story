Every dog has its day… and one brave Labrador is being hailed a hero after risking life and all four limbs to rescue two other furry buddies stranded on a runaway canoe.

Astonishing footage of the dog diving into a fast-flowing river, and then dragging the canoe with his pals back to the safety of the shore, has been posted on YouTube and is already attracting a healthy following.

No information is included with the video, but it appears to be shot somewhere in the U.S.

Canine conundrum: How did the two dogs end up on the canoe, and what will they do to escape?

He didn't even paws! Without a thought for his own safety, Robbie the Labrador jumps into the water and begins paddling furiously towards the distressed dogs

Heart-stopping moment: The dog's owner can be heard shouting words of encouragement as his pet struggles against the fierce current

Risky game: Some YouTube users have posted questions over why the humans did not help, and whether this was a training exercise

The footage starts with the bizarre sight of two dogs floating downriver in a canoe, one perched nervously at the front and the other whining behind.

The dog in front is barking from the boat but, while its tail is wagging, it is clear that the situation is becoming increasingly distressing.

Seemingly responding to the dog’s woof for help, our hero bounds into the water and swims towards the drifting canoe.

His owner and a friend encourage the dog, Robbie, to 'keep going, boy' and 'bring him home', as the Labrador furiously paddles against the current.

Strength and ingenuity: The clever Lab manages to find the rope attached to the canoe and drag the boat and two yapping dogs back to shore

Where's the thank you? Once they reach the riverbank, the two stranded dogs jump off and run away

Well done! Robbie shakes himself off and soaks his owner as the man gives him a well-deserved pat

Eventually, Robbie manages to find the rope attached to the canoe and begins an extraordinary tug-o-war as he drags it back to shore.

Despite his life-saving efforts, the other two dogs leap from the canoe without a word of thanks when they get close enough to the shore and disappear off camera.

Thankfully, the hero dog’s owner is on hand to give him a good pat.

Some YouTube users described the footage as 'incredible', but others criticised the humans, asking why they let the dog risk being washed away while they themselves did nothing to help.

The most satisfying part of the drama has to be the moment right at the very end of the clip, when Robbie vigorously shakes himself dry and gives his owner a soaking.
