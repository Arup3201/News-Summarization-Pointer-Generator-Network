The wrapped body of a 67-year-old woman has washed up on a Florida beach three weeks after she went missing. 

Patricia Danna-Harrison, 67, vanished on December 19 around 10.30pm after dropping off a friend following a holiday party.

Mrs Danna-Harrison, from Sebastian, was found by a cadaver-sniffing K-9 unit on Sunday, according to Brevard County Sheriff's Office.

Mrs Danna-Harrison's son Alfred Geary (pictured with his girlfriend) committed suicide as police were on their way to question him over his mother's disappearance

The body had washed ashore on a Jupiter Beach. She had left her personal belongings, car and medication at home.

On December 29, police went to the home of the missing woman's son Alfred Geary to question him about her disappearance.

They found 49-year-old Mr Geary dead from apparent suicide. He reportedly shot himself in the bedroom of the home he shared with his mother. He did not leave a note. 

Detective Todd Finnegan told MailOnline on Monday that there were no other suspects in the case.

Police say that Mr Geary had been co-operating on the investigation. However the lead detective in the case, Todd Finnegan, told WPTV that Mr Geary's story about his mother's disappearance did not make sense.

He did not report her missing for several days, saying that his mom must have gone shopping but that she didn't take her car or purse.

Mr Geary's girlfriend is cooperating with police.
