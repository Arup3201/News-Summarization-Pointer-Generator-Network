Workers have begun dismantling the crane on top of a London skyscraper which was hit by a helicopter yesterday.

Hundreds of local residents are unable to return to their homes due to the damaged machinery dangling 500ft in the air on top of The Tower, St George Wharf in Vauxhall.

A mobile crane belonging to a hire firm arrived at the scene of the accident at 9.30 this morning to start the process of securing the damaged crane.

In addition, the UK's largest crane is on it way to the site to help with the operation of replacing the machinery with a new model.

Repair: Workmen today on top of the crane which was hit by a helicopter in Vauxhall

Jeopardy: Workmen scaled the equipment today to assess the damage done to it by yesterday's crash

If contractors are still working tomorrow, they will have to contend with snow and high winds as well as freezing temperatures.

The crane was damaged when it was hit by a helicopter piloted by experienced flyer Peter Barnes yesterday morning.

Mr
Barnes died in the crash along with pedestrian Matt Wood, but two crane
operators were saved from certain death after arriving at work late.

The
ongoing danger posed by the dangling crane means that homes and offices
nearby have been completely closed, while motorists are being urged to 
avoid the area.

Damaged: This crane at St George Wharf is dangling over the street after being hit by a helicopter yesterday

Debris: A section of the crane was left lying in Nine Elms Lane after the collision

Damage: Remains of a helicopter sit on the roof of a building today. Police cordons have remained in place

Fuselage: The damaged rotor of the plane was one of many pieces of the helicopter mechanism on the ground

Police barriers are expected to remain in place until the middle of next week, but this morning contractors from crane firm Ainscough were allowed past to begin working on the site.

The UK's tallest mobile crane, which stands at 96m, is also set to arrive at the site later today and will start work on Saturday morning, according to Construction News.

It will help remove the damaged crane and replace it with a new piece of machinery which will continue the construction on St George Wharf.

'We are taking down the jib and everything today,' Tony Pidgley, chairman of the tower's developer Berkeley, told Construction News.

'There’s only one crane in the country that’s big enough to get it out, and that’s been travelling overnight down from the North.'

A spokesman for Ainscough said that 
the firm would be unable to estimate how long it would take to secure 
the crane until workers could survey the damage thoroughly.

'Our contractors are on site to help assist emergency service,' he said. 'It is difficult to know how long it will take to get it down until we get up there and assess the damage.'

Removal: This huge vehicle arrived at the site this morning to start the process of removing the crane

Getting to work: Police closed off the area for the contractors hired to secure the building site today

Lengthy process: It is unclear when the area will be made safe for residents and office workers to return

The company's work could be delayed by the poor weather forecast for Friday and the weekend.

The capital is set to be hit by perilous blizzards and sub-zero temperatures as up to four inches of snow are expected to fall.

Local residents have been ordered to stay away from the area due to the danger posed by the crane and the debris strewn around the roads.

New Covent Garden flower 
market, where a trader was hit in the leg by the helicopter's gearbox, 
remained closed today, although the fruit and vegetable market was open.

Residents of the tower which was hit were put up at the upmarket Park Plaza hotel in Embankment by managers of the development.

Preparation: Three trucks carrying crane equipment arrived at the site this morning

Cleaning up: A team of police officers inspecting the area around the crash site on Thursday

Tidying: Officials were seen today removing the parts of the helicopter which were distributed around the area

One resident, Stephen Swan, said officials had given no indication of when they might be allowed to return.

'It is annoying because we have been kept in the dark over when it will be,' he said.

'It could be today, it could be next week - we just don't know as they are not saying anything.'

A
site supervisor who had been working at St George Wharf said the area 
had been abandoned by workers over concerns the building was unsafe.

'There may be structural damage so the building has been locked down,' he said.

Investigation: Authorities are removing the wreckage in order to determine the cause of the accident

Search: Forensic teams investigated the wreckage on the closed-off roads today

Tidy: Workers in hard hats were seen piling the wreckage into large bags

Hundreds of others are believed to have been evacuated from other buildings in Vauxhall - but although Lambeth and Wandsworth councils set up a rest centre for those affected, no one stayed there over Wednesday night.

A spokesman for Wandsworth council suggested that most residents had been able to stay with friends or relatives instead, adding: 'You open up the rest centre because you have to - and you never know'.

Train and Tube services were running normally today after Vauxhall station was closed yesterday, but Transport for London warned motorists and bus passengers to expect delays and diversions.

Wreckage: This morning officials had not yet removed the debris of the helicopter in Wandsworth Rd

Crash: The ground was strewn with helicopter parts from Pete Barnes's Agusta 109

Crew: Firemen were also on the scene on Thursday working to secure the site of the accident

Up to a dozen bus routes have been re-directed, with the changes expected to last until next Wednesday.

A
TfL worker helping commuters at Vauxhall said: 'It has been very 
difficult. We have had to shut the bus station which has confused 
people. They are in a rush to get to work.'

A
number of roads have also been closed to traffic, bringing the prospect
of major traffic jams in the area over the coming days.

Closures: Motorists face several more days of delays and diversions thanks to the accident

Investigation: Police pictured patrolling the site this morning on the day after the helicopter crash
