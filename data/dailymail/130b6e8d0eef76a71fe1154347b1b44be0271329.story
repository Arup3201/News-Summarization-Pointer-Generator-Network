A man who has been evading capture in Florida after skipping out on bail 16 years ago has been caught in Panama and brought back to Miami by the U.S. Marshals service.

Samuel Silva was arrested in April 1998 for driving under the influence after he crashed into a state trooper's car and nearly killed her when the gas tank exploded.

'When that violent crash happened, her gas tank exploded. The trooper (Marissa Sanders) was pinned under the vehicle,' Marshals Service spokesman Barry Golden told NBC Miami.

In custody: Samuel Silva had to be transported to the U.S. by private jet after causing such a commotion on the commercial airliner that the Marshals Service planned to use

Now and then: Silva, now 46 (left), was first arrested in 2001 (right), three years after he caused an explosive accident that left a female state trooper with third degree burns

The station reports that after a lengthy investigation and ensuing search, Silva was brought into court and sentenced to almost nine and a half years behind bars.

He appealed the verdict in May 2001 and was released on bond, but when that appeal was denied three years later, he failed to show up for the hearing, noting the start of his years on the run.

The intelligence data collected by the Marshals office suggests that Silva, who is now 46, went to Puerto Rico in 2005 and lefty by August of that year.

From then on, he traveled to various Spanish-speaking countries including Spain, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Guatemala before ending up more permanently in Panama.

In addition to his earlier charge of 
DUI causing serious injury, Silva now faces two more charges of failure 
to appear and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, the latter of which 
is classified as a federal charge.

Silva attempted to put down roots in Panama in recent months, buying four properties and two cars in Panama City.

Dangerous: Silva first evaded capture following this 1998 accident for three years

Moved around: Silva got a fake passport in Puerto Rico in 2005 and has traveled to a host of Spanish-speaking countries ever since, landing most recently in Panama and buying property there

It wasn't those purchases that tipped off investigators, however, as they kept their attention paid to the false passport he was issued in Puerto Rico in 2005 under a relative's name.

Police in Panama assisted the Marshals Service in Silva's arrest, but he didn't go quietly: he caused such a commotion on the commercial airline on Friday while being transported by guards that they had to leave the plane and hire a private jet.

The jet cost the federal government $30,000 and landed in Fort Lauderdale's executive airport on Monday.

'It doesn't matter how far you travel. It doesn't matter where you go. You can run. You can hide in a different country. The Marshals Service does not quit,' Mr Golden told area news station Local 10.
