NBC is footing the bill for their $20million-a-year man Matt Lauer's helicopter jaunts to and from his Hamptons estate, it was claimed today.

In an effort to keep the veteran Today anchor happy, network bosses are allegedly paying for Lauer to commute to his mansion in Long Island where he lives permanently with wife Annette and their three children.

In June, Lauer signed a two-year extension on his annual $20million contract with Today, calling it 'the best job in broadcasting'.

Lauer's popularity had waned following the messy departure in 2012 of co-host Ann Curry and speculation swirled that he may leave Today. 

But following a slide in ratings to rival morning show, Good Morning America, management believed that Lauer was key to Today's success - and along with the bumper pay-packet offered helicopter rides to sweeten the deal. 

An NBC source told Page Six: 'NBC News chiefs want to do everything to keep Matt happy. They believe ''Today'' has turned a corner and he is the key to its continuing success. They agreed to pay for his helicopter flights to the Hamptons and back, so he can spend more time with his family.'

The source alleged that Lauer could be flying to and from the Hamptons up to three times a week from Manhattan heliports.    

High-flier: NBC confirmed on Thursday that Lauer sometimes commutes to his Hamptons home from the city by helicopter - but no word on who foots the bill for the average $1300 cost of each trip

 The Today show confirmed to MailOnline today that Lauer did chopper out to his Hamptons home, reportedly worth $15million, where he also has a 40-acre horse farm. 

NBC is reportedly paying for Today host Matt Lauer's helicopter rides to and from the Hamptons

A Today show spokesman said: 'On rare occasion Matt will fly home, but most of the time you'll find him stuck in traffic on the Long Island Expressway with everyone else.'

One charter company, Liberty Helicopters, revealed today that one seat on a five-seater helicopter from Manhattan to Southampton, Long Island, costs $1280 for a round trip.

However no word from Today on whether Lauer or NBC foots the bill. 

The 56-year-old anchor has been with the Today show since 1994 making him the longest lasting host in U.S. daytime TV history. 

Lauer also keeps an apartment in Manhattan. His grueling schedule includes daily 4am wake-up calls for the morning show which is filmed in New York City's Rockefeller Center.

In an interview with Hamptons magazine, Lauer told fellow NBC presenter Hoda Kotb that he had a 'painfully normal existence' in the exclusive resort taking riding lessons, walking the dog and watching his children compete in sports teams.  

But it has not all been domestic bliss for the Lauers. In 2006, and while pregnant with her third child, Annette, a former model, filed for divorce but they pair later reconciled.

In 2010, gossip magazines reported that Matt was having an affair but the couple weathered the relationship storm.
