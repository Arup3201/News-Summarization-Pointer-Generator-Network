The son of  Edelweiss singer Vince Hill has been found dead just hours after crashing his car on black ice.

Athol Hill, 42, was discovered at the home of his 15-year-old daughter and her mother. Paramedics were called but he could not be revived.

Detectives were today awaiting the results of a post mortem examination to establish the exact cause of his death.

Today his distraught 79-year-old father was trying to come to terms with his death as well as nursing his critically ill wife Annie, who has a serious lung complaint.

Police confirmed that Athol Hill was involved in a crash in Henley-on-Thames, South Oxfordshire, on Sunday evening when his silver coloured Renault Scenic is thought to have skidded on black ice, crashed into several parked cars and slammed into a garden wall.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said that the accident was being treated as 'damage only' and that Athol was not thought to have been injured.

The father-of-two was collected from the scene and driven to the home of his teenage daughter and her mother, Liz Green in Henley-on-Thames.

Thirty-six hours later Ms Green tried to rouse him but discovered he had died.

The body was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, where a pathologist will carry out the post mortem examination.

'The death is not being treated as suspicious although inquiries are continuing on behalf of the Oxfordshire coroner and an inquest will be opened later,' said the spokesman.

Mr Hill topped the bill at the London Palladium in the 1970s and hit the No 2 spot in the Top 10 with his hit song Edelweiss.

Today Mr Hill was awaiting a coroner's report as to how Athol had died.

He said: 'When I broke the news of Athol's death to my sister, she gasped, "how much more can we take as a family?" before bursting into tears'.

Robert Holmes, the singer’s agent for the last 40 years, said, 'It is totally tragic for Vince and Annie.

'They’ve been so supportive of Athol over the years and now this happens. Sadly, you never know what life is going to throw at you.

'I’ve known Athol since he was born. He was the child they had waited so long for and never expected to have.

'When Athol arrived, Vince and Annie were the happiest couple in the world.'

Athol was understood to have called in at Liz’s home to visit his teenage daughter after the crash, which was understood to have left him with blurred vision.

He walked away from the scene but was worried about the Renault Scenic, which was a write-off.
