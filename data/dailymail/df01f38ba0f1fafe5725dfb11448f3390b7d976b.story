Robin van Persie's goal scoring form at the 2014 World Cup has understandably seen his popularity soar as the Dutchman became the 10th most followed footballer on Facebook.    

The Holland striker has already bagged three goals in two games for Louis van Gaal's side and can now celebrate picking up over 10million Facebook likes.

Van Persie enters an impressive list of players to reach the landmark which has already been surpassed by the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Neymar and Lionel Messi.

The Manchester United striker has picked up 642.2K Facebook likes in the past week as he helped steer Holland into the knockout stages of the World Cup with a game to spare.

Spanish stars Iker Casillas and Andres Iniesta remain in the top 10 despite La Roja's shock World Cup exit which included a 5-1 drubbing at the hands of Holland.

Spain goalkeeper Casillas has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons in Brazil after two poor performances but the Real Madrid legend still managed to gain an extra 307.7K likes over the past seven days.

Under-fire England striker Wayne Rooney sits in fifth place with 21.6million Facebook fans even though the Three Lions have also crashed out of the summer tournament.

Sorry: Wayne Rooney (right) used his Facebook page to apologise for England's early exit

Rooney 
recently took to his Facebook page to apologise to the England faithful 
for his side's poor performances which led to defeats against Italy and 
Uruguay in Group D.

He
 wrote: 'Absolutely devastated to be out of the World Cup. Going into 
each game we had great belief in ourselves but unfortunately it hasn't 
worked out.

'Sorry to all the fans that travelled and at home that we haven't done better...gutted!'

Unsurprisingly,
 Cristiano Ronaldo tops the list with a whopping 87.2million fans on the
 social media network as his popularity increases despite being on the 
fringes during Portugal's 4-0 defeat against Germany.

The
 29-year-old is currently a major doubt for Portugal's second World Cup 
match against USA after pulling up with a knee injury during training 
last week.
