The temperatures in London still signal winter but Victoria Beckham is hailing the beginning of spring. 

The fashion designer has commissioned a new art installation for the front of her 36 Dover Street clothes store to signal the start of SS15 season. 

Last season, Victoria worked with Shirazeh Houshiary on a Christmas tree at the shop, this time she collaborated with acclaimed set designer Andy Hillman on a floral design.

The designer created a giant foxglove, complete with pollinating bees, to sit at the bottom of the main staircase in the store. 

The sculpture has been suspended from the ceiling to make it look like it is growing up from the stark concrete floor. 

Andy also designed a vinyl foxglove floral to cover the glass window at the front of the shop, which continues out onto the stairs that lead up to the door. 

Victoria's upside down Christmas tree installation created a mass of public attention when it was built at the store for the festive season.

It was similar to the tree that Shirazeh Houshiary created for the Tate in 1993, which Victoria referenced when thinking of Christmas decorations for the store last autumn. 

Victoria, 40, opened her Dover Street boutique in September, the first standalone store for her high-fashion brand which has been winning critical acclaim since it launched in 2008.

The store houses handbags, sunglasses and the Victoria Victoria Beckham collection on the ground level and her main collection upstairs.

In an exclusive tour of the Dover Street space back in September, the designer told MailOnline why she shunned traditional features such as a till and a window display in favour of a more contemporary space.

‘It’s the first time people can see the brand through my eyes,’ she said. ‘I didn’t want a traditional shop window, just a plain window, and a huge concrete sliding door.’ 

On the subject of tills, she added: ‘We’re not going to have any ugly tills anywhere. Payment is with an iPad, so we can go to the customer on whatever floor she’s on.’
