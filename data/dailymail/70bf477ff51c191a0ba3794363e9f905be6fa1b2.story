Alberto Contador has confirmed he will ride in the Vuelta a Espana after recovering from the broken shin bone which ruled him out of the Tour de France.

The Spaniard originally stated last month that he would be unfit to recover in time to take part in his home Grand Tour.

Contador and Team Sky's Chris Froome - who will also ride the Vuelta - had been pre-race favourites for the Tour de France in July but both crashed out of the race with injuries.

On Thursday morning, the four-time Grand Tour winner - who has triumphed in the Vuelta twice before - posted a video on Twitter confirming he would take part in the tour.

And in a statement released by his Tinkoff-Saxo team soon after, he said: 'I've been riding the bicycle for the last 10 days and yesterday was the first day I could climb a mountain pass without knee pain.

'That excites me, motivates me and has led me to make the decision to run the Tour of Spain.

'I know it's a Tour of Spain I'll have to do in a very different way than I had thought earlier in the season, or as I planned the Tour de France, but I think it can be very good considering the end of season and to start next year with guarantees.'

Colombian Giro d'Italia victor Nairo Quintana (Movistar), Garmin-Sharp's Andrew Talansky and Joaquim Rodriguez will also be at the Vuelta. 

The three-week race begins with a time trial in Jerez de la Frontera on August 23.

Gone: Team Sky's Chris Froome was also forced to withdraw from the Tour de France after crashing 

Pressure: One of Froome or Contador is expected to win the Vuelta, after they were favourites for the Tour
