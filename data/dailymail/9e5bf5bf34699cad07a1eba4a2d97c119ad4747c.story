Two Texas teenagers are suffering from a kidney disease so rare that it was only diagnosed when the oldest boy was 18.

Jonathan and Christopher Naquin are both suffering from the life-threatening and incurable Alport Syndrome, but despite a succession of doctor's appointments their symptoms slipped under the radar.

The genetic disorder is so rare, with fewer than 60,000 cases in the U.S., that medical staff struggled to piece together the symptoms.

Genetic: Christopher and Jonathan's symptoms, including hearing loss, were not picked up until last year

Jonathan, 18, was finally diagnosed last year, after becoming so frail that his doctor feared he may have cancer.

Fewer than 60,000 people in the U.S. have Alport Syndrome, a genetic disorder that attacks the kidneys.

Early symptoms of the disease, which affects more men than women, is blood and protein in the urine.

The disorder affects the connective tissues in the kidneys, but because the same tissue is found in the eyes and ears, sight loss and deafness are often early indicators of Alport.

Alport causes scarring to the kidneys and, as the sufferer gets older, signs of organ damage become more clear. 

The syndrome, if left unchecked, can cause kidney failure in teenagers and young adults.

Family history and a kidney biopsy are used to test for Alport. 

No treatment is currently available for Alport, though patients are often prescribed medication that can slow the damage. 

Kidney transplants and dialysis are often needed.

At 6ft 2in, he weighed only 129 pounds and was pale. After being referred to Texas Children's Hospital, he was found to have a rare disease that attacks the tissues in his kidneys.

His kidneys were found to be failing fast and the 18-year-old is currently on a transplant list.

His brother's symptoms were not so  advanced and, for now, he has been prescribed medication.

However, with no cure, both boys have been told to expect to undergo several kidney transplants in their lifetime.

Signs that the boys may have Alport Syndrome were first noticeable before they were even born.

Their mother, Carol, is believed to have passed the gene that causes the disorder to her sons.

'When I was 2 the doctors found protein 
and blood in my urine. They did many tests over the years but they were 
never able to explain it,' Mrs Naquin told ABC News.

When they were growing up, her sons also both tested positive regularly for blood and protein in their urine, but the signals of Alport were missed. 

Even when they both lost their 
hearing during elementary school - a common side effect of the syndrome -
 doctors failed to pick up a more sinister problem.

When
 Alport was finally diagnosed the family struggled to find information 
about it. When it was finally spotted in Jonathan, his parents were given a 
printout at the hospital.

Diagnosed: Jonathan's symptoms were recognized when his parents became concerned about his weight

Waiting list: Jonathan, 18, is waiting for a kidney transplant

Life-changing: Jonathan, left, and younger brother Christopher, 16, may need several kidney transplants

'When they tell you your child has a 
rare disease you know nothing about and then they send you to the 
Internet, I can't describe the raw emotion,' Mrs Naquin said, adding that she felt anxious and guilty at first.

Sharon Lagas, of the Alport
 Syndrome Foundation, said that the family's experience was typical. The syndrome is so rare it is known as an 'orphan disease' because it affects so few people. 

Its symptoms are also found in other diseases, making an early diagnosis difficult unless it has already been found in another family members.

But Dr 
Clifford Kashtan, executive director of the
 Alport Syndrome Treatment and Outcomes Registry at the University of 
Minnesota in Minneapolis, said: 'Early hearing loss, blood in the urine and history of kidney failure are all red flags.'

The syndrome usually begins by affecting the eyesight and hearing of sufferers, before moving on to the kidneys during the teenage years.

For now, Jonathan and Christopher are getting the help they need to manage the effects of the syndrome, but both face needing several transplants and dialysis.

'If more doctors were aware of this disease, my kids' kidneys could have been protected much sooner,' Mrs Naquin said. 'A little more knowledge on their part would have meant a lot less heartache on mine.'
