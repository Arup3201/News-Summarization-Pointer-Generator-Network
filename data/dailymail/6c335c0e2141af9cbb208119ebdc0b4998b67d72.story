The National Trust may be best known for country estates and cream teas, but the trust's new exhibition will take place in a council flat in east London.

In 1967 the Balfron Tower, in Poplar, was completed and for two months the following year its architect, Erno Goldfinger, lived in apartment 130 to prove how desirable his new building was. 

Now, as part of a display on Brutalist architecture, the National Trust has restored the flat to its original 1960s style, and is inviting the public to look around.

As part of an exhibition on Brutalist architecture, the National Trust has given flat 130 at the top of Balfron Tower in east London a 1960s makeover and will be opening it up to the public from October 1

The tower was completed in 1967, and the following year it's designer, Erno Goldfinger, moved into flat 130 in an attempt to demonstrate the appeal of high-rise living

A spokesman for the Trust said: 'Balfron Tower, along with its younger sister Trellick Tower, is a testament to a particular moment in time when a vision of a utopian post-war Britain coincided with Brutalism – an architectural movement that changed the landscape of our urban environment. 

'This was intended to be a heroic architecture that sought to offer the best of design to the masses and to free people from the slum housing and poor conditions still prevalent in 1960s Britain.'

Designer Wayne Hemingway and his daughter Tilly scoured market stalls, auctions and eBay in order to give the flat and authentic 1960s look.

Everything, from the LPs stacked on shelves, to the Beatles bed cover, and posters of Twiggy in the teenage bedroom is from the period.

For smaller items, such as the bottle of aftershave and can of Gillette in the bathroom, the pair were forced to raid the Land Of Lost Content museum, in Shropshire. 

Goldfinger was born in Hungary but emigrated to Paris after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and moved to Britain in 1934 after marrying Ursula Blackwell, heiress to the Crosse and Blackwell food company fortune.

Goldfinger (left), a Hungarian communist, moved to Britain in 1934. He designed the headquarters of the British Communist Party, before building the Balfron Tower and its sister building, the Trellick Tower. James Bond author Ian Fleming so hated Goldfinger that the writer named one of his villains after him

Designer Wayne Hemingway and his daughter Tilly scoured auctions, markets and eBay to give the flat an authentic Sixties feel. Everything from the furniture, to the wallpaper, and even the board games, is from the period

A supporter of communism, he spent his years before the Second World War living  in Highgate, and after the conflict  began designing buildings for the likes of the Daily Worker newspaper and the British Communist Party.

For Goldfinger, who was so despised by James Bond author Ian Fleming that the writer adopted his name for a villain in his books, high rise living was the future of Britain in the Sixties.

He saw building upwards as a way to keep more green space open for people to enjoy at ground level, a mission he shared with the founder of the National Trust, Octavia Hill.

He also saw high rise towers as a way to solve the chronic lack of housing in post-Second World War Britain, and move the poor out of slums and into better quality apartments. 

The Balfron was his first experiment with tower blocks, having built several terraced homes in Hampstead, north west London, including his own house at 2 Williow Road, which the National Trust also looks after.

It was the design of this property that first drew the anger of Fleming, after he opposed the demoluition of several cottages  to make way for it.

Goldfinger saw high-rise living as a way to provide low-cost housing to the poor and  solve the chronic lack of homes in post-war Britain, while also keeping green space

For smaller items, such as records, a bottle of aftershave and a can of Gillette, the designers also raided the Land Of Lost Content museum, in Shropshire

The block would later be used as a blueprint the blueprint for its sister building, the Trellick Tower in west London, and sparked a wave of copy-cat buildings across the country.

However, while apartments in the Trellick Tower now sell for upwards of £500,000, Balfron became known for violence, crime and poverty.

Balfron itself is in the process of being renovated, with current residents being housed elsewhere until the building is finished.

Council tenants who want to move back in will be allowed to do so, while those who want to leave will be rehomed, and their flats sold off to private investors. The apartments currently sell for £155,000.

The Balfron Tower pop-up exhibition will run for two weeks, beginning on October 1. Ticketsare available here.

While Balfron Tower sparked a wave of copy-cat social housing across the country, as an experiment in high-rise living it ultimately proved a failure, becoming synonymous with poverty, crime and violence
