Actress, mum and philanthropist, Salma Hayek couldn't have been in better company to launch the new film produced by her charity Chime for Change, which she set up with fellow A-lister Beyonce. 

The 48-year-old unveiled the documentary, Humaira: The Game Changer, which follows Pakistani education advocate Humaira Bachal, at the Women's Forum Global Meeting in Deauville, France. 

The conference saw female leaders in business, science, education and human rights gather with the mission to 'strengthen women's influence throughout the globe' and the inspirational actress got top billing.

Before introducing the film, Salma spoke candidly about what motivates her on her mission to bring justice to women around the globe through her charity work.

Salma set up the Chime for Change with two (rather powerful) friends: Beyoncé Knowles and Frida Giannini, creative director of Gucci.

In June last year the threesome managed to get the world talking female empowerment with their Sound of Change Live concert, which took place in London. 

Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, Mary J. Blige, John Legend and Rita Ora were among the mega names to lend their time and vocals to the event - as well as Beyonce and husband Jay Z, of course.

Just over a year later, Chime for Change has launched a new film to help keep the conversation about women's rights alive.

The documentary, Humaira: The Game Changer, follows Pakistani education advocate Humaira Bachal as she fulfils her dream of creating a 'Dream Model Street School' in the slums of Karachi, Pakistan, where education for girls is a taboo and the literacy rate among girls is only 15 per cent.

Humaira Bachal appeared at the Sound of Change Live concert last year with Madonna, who lauded her with praise for her efforts to create equal rights in education. 

'The Dream School has changed the lives of hundreds of children. Every girl deserves to go to school, regardless of where she was born,' said Madonna. 'Humaira is a freedom fighter. She is a hero for these girls and an example for all of us.'

After the global tribute, contributions began pouring in and a new school was built.

During an emotional moment in the new documentary 28-year-old Humaira says: 'It feels like we have moved from a site of ruins into a palace.'

The 18-room Dream Model Street School was completed in summer 2014, and includes a playground, library and computer lab. The school enables nearly 1,000 local girls and boys to pursue an education, and provides job opportunities for local women as teachers and assistants.

Directed by Oscar winner Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, the film is a follow-up to Humaira: The Dream Catcher, which was launched at the Sound of Change Live concert.   

Before introducing the new film at the Women's Forum Global Meeting last week, Salma, who was in conversation with Mariane Pearl, said she has had a burning desire to bring justice to women from a very young age. Domestic violence, she said, was a cause she feels particularly passionately about.

The actress was at pains to state that she had never experienced domestic violence within her own family, but said that a disturbing incident she witnessed at the age of six awakened her to the cause.

She described walking down the street with her parents in Mexico City and seeing a man beating up his wife on the other side of the street. When her father crossed the road to help the woman, the young Salma was amazed at what transpired.

'The woman started beating up my father and said, 'How dare you, he can do what he wants.' First I felt sorry for her, then worried for my dad, then I didn't know how I was supposed to feel. I was confused.

'That incident haunted me,' she said.

'What did she go through to think she deserved it - not only to out it with it, but to defend it?' said the actress, who now focuses her charitable work on domestic violence.

Her Charity Chime for Change promotes, education, health and justice for girls and women around the world.
