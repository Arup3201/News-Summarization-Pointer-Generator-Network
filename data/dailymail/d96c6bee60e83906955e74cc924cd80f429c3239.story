Three Republican lawmakers - House Speaker John Boehner, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen - are bringing Cuban dissidents as their guests to the State of the Union tonight as a symbol of their opposition to President Barack Obama's new Cuba policy.

Boehner will host Jorge 'Antúnez' Luis García Pérez, a former political prisoner of Fidel Castro who the Ohio Republican's office says was imprisoned for 17 years for denouncing the then-Cuban president's 'oppressive' regime, and his wife, Yris Tamara Pérez Aguilera, founder of the Rosa Parks Feminine Civic Rights Movement.

Pérez and Aguilera are 'leading the fight for freedom and human rights in Cuba' against the Raul Castro regime, Boehner's office said in a statement.

Her father died in a car accident in Cuba in 2012 that the driver of the vehicle alleges was no accident at all was instead the work of the Cuban government.  Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is bringing her to tonight's speech

Rubio said Monday that he had invited Rosa María Payá, daughter of the late Cuban activist Oswaldo Payá. Paya's father died in a car accident in Cuba in 2012 that the driver of the vehicle alleges was no accident at all was instead the work of the Cuban government.  

'For years, Oswaldo Payá courageously traveled throughout Cuba collecting tens of thousands of signatures from ordinary Cubans on a petition that came to be known as the Varela Project, which sought a peaceful democratic transition. All Oswaldo Payá wanted was a better future for Cuba and the Cuban people, and the Castro regime assassinated him for it,' Rubio said in a statement.

'Since her father’s murder,' Rubio said, 'Rosa María has honored his legacy by continuing to advocate for a free and democratic Cuba and also fighting to bring his murderers to justice.'

Ros-Lehtinen is taking Marlene Alejandre Triana, the daughter of late Brothers to the Rescue pilot Armando Alejandre Jr., as her guest. Triana's father was murdered by the Castro regime in 1996.

As part of the prisoner swap that freed American aid worker Alan Gross - who is coming to tonight's address as a guest of President Obama tonight - Obama commuted the sentence of one of the Cuban spies Ros-Lehtinen said today 'was one of the co-conspirators' in the plot to shoot down Triana's father's plane.

Obama will spend a few moments of his speech this evening boasting about his administration's secret talks with Cuba throughout 2014 that led to an announcement last month that the U.S. would resume diplomatic relations with the Communist country after more than 50 years of hostilities. 

Following Cuba's release of 53 political prisoners whose freedom the U.S. demanded,  Obama last week issued a memorandum easing restrictions on travel to the country. 

No longer will Americans have to apply for a special government license to visit Cuba for educational purposes, to see family or a handful of other reasons. They still won't be able to go to the country strictly for vacation, though.

And Americans who do travel to Cuba will now be able to bring back $100 of alcohol and cigars. A full lifting on trade and travel embargoes on the country must come from Congress, though, and a bipartisan block of lawmakers have vowed to make sure that doesn't happen.

Alejandre-Triana's father Armando Alejandre was one of four victims of a 1996 Brothers to the Rescue assassination after his plane was shot down by the Cuban military. She's coming tonight with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen

Over the holiday weekend group of federal lawmakers, led by Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, met in Havana with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez and other members of the country's government. Next week Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson will travel to Cuba to negotiate the opening of a U.S. Embassy there.

Appearing on Jose Diaz-Balart's show this morning on MSNBC, Ros-Lehtinen said she 'would like nothing more' than to 'get the Cuba people....free elections' and a multi-party system of governing. 

But the deal negotiated by the Obama administration 'is not gonna get us there,' she said. 

'It's a good deal for American tourists, maybe, who want cheaper rum and cheaper cigars, and maybe that's what's driving this conversation,' she said. 'But I think it's about freedom, it's about respect for human rights, and the president is not going to help the Cuban people get there.'

'We've given away the store, and I don't think the Cuban people are going to be any freer today or tomorrow with this very weak Cuba deal,' Ros-Lehtinen told him. 

The Cuban military runs the tourist bureau there, she explained, so the U.S. is just 'feeding the monster that then oppresses the people' when it encourages unrestricted trade and travel with the country.

Rubio said in a statement on Monday that the detente was only 'giving the regime legitimacy and greater access to American dollars it will use to fund its machine of repression – the very machine that harassed Oswaldo Payá for years, eventually murdered him and pays hush money to potential key witnesses.'

The GOP senator, whose parents were Cuban immigrants, said he hoped Rosa María presence at the State of the Union would 'at least remind [Obama] that her father’s murderers have not been brought to justice, and that the U.S. is now, in fact, sitting at the table with them.' 

Florida, the state both Ros-Lehtinen and Rubio represent in Congress, has the largest population of Cuban Americans in the U.S.
