Troubled discount retailer Target need look no further than the state of the shelves in its own stores to comprehend its huge $2 billion loss in Canada since opening there in 2013.

Launching north of the border with much fanfare last year, the embattled one-stop-shopping giant appears to have fundamental problems simply keeping its shelves adequately stocked - judging by these stark and miserable pictures taken at an unidentified Canadian Target outlet.

Having already endured the disastrous aftermath of losing millions of customer's credit information to a data-breach before Christmas, which cost CEO Gregg Steinhafel his job, Target's profits are down 46-percent this last quarter.

Empty: It may have been a good day at the Target store, but judging by the equally unstocked shelves behind it seems they have just been left untended

Indeed, the photographs of empty clothing racks, and shelves boasting 'unbeatable prices' on non-existent merchandise, suggest that Target's goal of generating $6 billion a year in sales in Canada by 2017 is an optimistic goal.

In some instances the store's Canadian display's resemble a flea market in terms of organization and with traditional strong performers at the bedding department and toys woefully understocked.

Market experts have scratched their heads as to why the discount chain is suffering so badly in Canada.

The launch in 2013 was huge, even for a firm boasting revenue of $72 billion and more than 300,000 staff across the US and Canada.

Renowned for its 'cheap chic', Target opened 123 stores in Canada and the first mistake they made is claimed to be buying out the premises of the now defunct Zellers chain, whose store leases it bought in 2011 for $1.8 billion.

The trouble with that was, the storesÂ  were often smaller than those in the United States, and found in down-market malls rather than up-and-coming retail destinations.

Some analysts said that Target's Canadian woes began with that while the company's inability to stock the stores with items Canadians want at the prices they expected is what ultimately alienated customers.

Indeed, it seems in some cases Target is not even stocking the shelves with any items, let alone products Canadians do not even want.

'Canadians were expecting the U.S. Target experience,' said Doug Stephens, president of Retail Prophet Consultants in Toronto. 'Instead they got Zellers with lipstick.'

Canadian shoppers also complain that prices are higher than they thought they would be, that there's inadequate selection of goods on the shelves, and that the company's supply chains don't meet the expectations drummed up by its advertising.

'For Target, every time they have something on sale in the flyer, they don't have it when you get to the store,' said Katie Witzell, 31, who was shopping at a Toronto Wal-Mart with her toddler.

Toronto interior designer Christine Tavares, 40, shopping at a Target store where some shelves were oddly barren of merchandise, said, 'I was here within the first week when it opened, and I was so disappointed. The shelves were empty. We were expecting what we saw in the States.'

It won't be easy for Target to sweeten the sour first impression it has made on Canadian shoppers, who were familiar with the retailer's U.S. stores and expected more selection and better prices.

'They over-promised and under-delivered and they're wearing two big shiners for it,' said Jim Danahy, chief executive of consultancy CustomerLAB and director of the Centre for Retail Leadership at York University's Schulich School of Business.

Running low: Target reported in February that its fourth-quarter profit fell 46 percent on a revenue decline of 5.3 percent as the breach scared off customers

Target says it's working on the problems, though fixing them may take time.

'Again, it's not done, it's not perfect, and it's not everyday,'' said Eric Hausman, a Target spokesman. 'On any given day, in any given time, we think it's incrementally better than it was several weeks ago, several months ago and that's what we're looking for.'

The company expects $300 million to $400 million in capital spending in Canada this year, down from the peak of more than $1 billion in 2013, to fix the stores, John Mulligan, Target's former chief financial officer and now interim chief executive, said in February.

Mulligan said last year that the stores were in very poor condition, with $10 million to $11 million in renovations expected for each location.

It's an investment that may yet pay off with customers who laud the clean stores and customer service they are used to in the U.S.

'I settle for a few items that I can get here rather than go somewhere else like Wal-Mart,' said Raeanna Guitard, a little person who needs help reaching high shelves, as she shopped at a Target in Toronto. 'I won't go to Wal-Mart unless I need to. It's unorganized and no one can ever assist me.'

Spot one: There are scant opportunities on these shelves to pick up any merchandise, let alone get 70 percent off the product

But Guitard, a government worker, also still shops at Target in the United States once a month, saying the furniture, clothing and household selection is better than it is in Canada.

Canadians are used to paying more for goods than in the U.S. and the disparity is more or less tolerated. It is often blamed on currency fluctuations, taxes, tariffs and transportation costs.

Hani Shabbir, 26, a stay-at-home mother of two, shopping with her infant son, said she likes Target because it is conveniently located and has good products, but she finds the shelves are often empty.

'This one is more expensive. Also, there are a lot of people near here, so you have to be the first to grab things, if you're late you'll miss it, it's gone,' she said. 'My son has colic, and we need gripe water, and it's never in stock. It has been three weeks, and there is no gripe water -- we want the right kind. We end up running all over looking for it, and come back here a few times but it is never in stock.'

Still, there is hope fashionistas drawn by Target's reputation as a treasure trove for fun, cheap clothes and higher-quality merchandise than Wal-Mart may extend their patience a little longer. It's just up to Target to deliver.

Katie Witzell, the Wal-Mart shopper, said she gave Target five or six tries when it first opened, and may give it another.

'The only thing I like at Target, why I may go back, is their sheets,' she said. 'They do have good quality bedding.'
