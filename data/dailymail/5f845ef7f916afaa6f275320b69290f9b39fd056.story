This is the heart-pounding moment a man dressed as Santa springs a surprise proposal on his girlfriend in front of a packed auditorium.

Zach Smith from Batesville, Arkansas, turned up at Lake Hamilton High School last week and got up on stage as his girlfriend, Amanda Nitcher, directed a choir concert.

A video of the stunt shows him dressed as Mr Claus, giving a speech about how Nitcher is the 'love of his life' before he finally gets down on one knee and asks for her hand in marriage. 

A very merry proposal: Zach Smith (left) from Batesville, Arkansas, decided to spring a surprise visit on his choir director girlfriend, Amanda Nitcher (right), last week

Novel idea: He got up on stage dressed as Santa and proceeded to dig out objects from his sack

Dressed to impress: Smith handed his girlfriend a Christmas outfit, consisting of a red jacket and hat

Set to marry: Smith and Nitcher met at Ouachita Baptist University in the music department and have been dating for two years

'Will you be my Mrs Claus?' he queries, as a shocked Nitcher covers her face with her hands.

Luckily she nods her head a 'yes' moments later.

The choir and audience watching are heard cheering in celebration. Nitcher waves her hands in the air to show off her engagement ring in response.

Before actually popping the question, Smith ensured that Nitcher looked as festive as he did by handing her a red jacket and fur-trimmed hat from his sack.

Will you marry me? Once Nitcher was appropriately dressed, Smith popped the big question  

I do! She covered her face with her hands in shock before nodding a big 'yes'

Cause for celebration: The choir and audience watching cheered and clapped 

Bride-to-be: Nitcher showed off her sparkling engagement ring 

To date the video of their wedding proposal has been watched more than 4,000 times on Facebook.

Many viewers have congratulated Smith for the novel idea.

'Oh wow, this made me cry!' one friend wrote.

Commenting on his romantic gesture, Smith said: 'We feel that God has called us to invest in the lives of students. I liked it, so I put a ring on it.'

There is no word on when the spouses-to-be plan on tying the knot.
