Currently the only way of spotting cars on dark country roads is by their lights.

But Nissan has trialled technology that means cars could glow-in-the-dark  on the roads to become more visible.

The Japanese car manufacturer has become the first  to apply UV absorbing paint on a production car.

Nissan has become the first car to manufacturer to apply UV absorbing paint on a production car. The 'ultraviolet-energised paint' on the Nissan Leaf electric car is a demonstration of a secret paint formula made up of organic materials. Use the slider, above to see the car glow after dark

The ‘ultraviolet-energised paint’ on the Nissan Leaf electric car is a demonstration of a secret paint formula made up of organic materials.

Known as Starpath, the paint is applied by spraying and absorbs UV energy from the sun throughout the day.

It is able to glow for between eight and 10 hours when the sun goes down.

The paint is the brainchild of Surrey-based inventor Hamish Scott, who is already trialling glow-in-the-dark cycle paths in Cambridge.

The paint is able to glow for between eight and 10 hours when the sun goes down (pictured). It’s made from very rare earth materials, including Strontium Aluminate, which is solid, odourless and chemically and biologically inert

However, the paint option won't be a choice for future customers because the ingredients mean it is unlikely to be used on a large scale.

People can, however, have the treatment applied to their own car or buy UV car ‘wraps’ to enable their car to glow-in-the-dark.

This would enable them to find their car easily in a dark car park, as well as making them more visible on pitch black roads.

Nissan told Autoexpress that if the paint was ever offered, the glow would probably last for around 25 years.

The experiment was done to showcase the increasing number of Leaf owners who are charging their cars using solar energy.

Nissan says its eco-friendly car costs less than two pence per mile to run and that 89 per cent of Leaf owners in the UK charge their cars at home overnight.

A trial of the Starpath technology is under way in Cambridge city centre, where a spray has been applied to cyclepaths to make them glow.

The luminescent, rain-resistant coating could one day replace street lights.

It is applied in three layers, with a middle aggregate stage that absorbs UV energy during the day, which is then released as a blue glow when it's dark.

The system uses polyurethane base and a polyaspartic topcoat that seals the whole thing together.

According to the Pro-Teq Surfacing, the company behind the technology, it can be applied to almost any solid surface including tarmac, concrete and wood.

Unlike those glow in the dark stars you used to stick on your walls, Starpath reacts to varying levels of ambient light.

‘This product adjusts to the natural light, so if it is pitch black outside the luminous natural earth enhances,’ said Mr Scott, who owns the firm.

‘If the sky is lighter, it won’t release as much luminosity – it adjusts accordingly, it’s almost like it has a mind of its own.’

Nasa has teamed up with car manufacturer Nissan to develop new self-driving cars that could be used to race across the surface of Mars.

The technology created during the five-year partnership will also be adapted to create better driverless vehicles that can be used on roads on Earth.

Robotics experts from the space agency will work with engineers from Nissan to adapt the company's electric Leaf cars.

Future rovers on Mars could look more like Nissan's Leaf electric cars (pictured) as the automobile manufacturer is to develop technology jointly with Nasa to create self-driving vehicles that could be used on Earth and in space

Nissan has pledged to have autonomous cars on the market by 2020, but the technology currently faces significant challenges to cope with the dangers of public roads.

However, Nasa believes sensors and systems being developed to help driverless cars deal with pedestrians, cyclists, overtaking vehicles and parked cars, could also help to develop new robotic rovers for use in exploring other planets.

t is not the first project that Nasa and Nissan have collaborated on. In 2005 the two organisations teamed up to develop more comfortable and safer car seats.

Nissan drew upon data from Nasa's Human Research Program at its Johnson Space Centre that had used experiments from space to examine the neutral body position of astronauts while they were sitting in low gravity.

Nissan used this to build seats for its cars that would lower the amount of fatigue drivers would feel and reduce pressure spots.
