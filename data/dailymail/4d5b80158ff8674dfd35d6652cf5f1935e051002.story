British comedian Harry Enfield has upset his Primrose Hill neighbours with plans to turn a local pub into a £3 million house for him and his family

Comedian Harry Enfield’s plans to convert a pub into a £3million family home have angered his neighbours.

He bought the Queens last year with the intention of living upstairs while a friend ran a restaurant downstairs.

But he wrote to neighbours saying the plan was not financially viable and he would convert the whole building into house.

Former regulars at the pub, in Primrose Hill, North London, said the conversion would ruin the ‘strong sense of community’ on the street, while a local councillor called the move a ‘tragic loss’.

Mr Enfield and his wife Lucy, a designer, currently live in West London and bought the property with the intention of moving when their three children – aged 15, 13 and nine - finish school.

In a letter to local residents, Mr Enfield, 51, pointed out that his family had lived in the area for years.

The actor, who famously played Kevin the Teenager and Wayne the Slob, said: ‘I have been a resident of Primrose Hill since 1988, my family since 1929.’

If the council did not grant permission for the change of use to a home he would consider other options, he said, but warned ‘every other option would take time and stretch us financially’.

He added: ‘There are two other pubs within 50 yards, four other pubs within 150 yards and six other pubs within 300 yards, we would imagine the council might think the loss of this one not to be too great, the compensation being greater tranquillity.’

The pub’s former landlord Tony Peters, who ran it for 32 years before his retirement last year, expressed concern that Mr Enfield’s plans would change the nature of the street.

He told a local newspaper: ‘This is a
great little street with a sense of community. People know each other 
and everyone would like it to remain a pub. It should not be changed 
into a house. It plays such an important role in the area.

'Where are 
people going to meet, socialise, hold their celebrations, their wakes? 
McDonald’s? Starbucks?  It was a good pub with a good clientele, and it 
was successful.’

The pub has been closed since Mr 
Peters retired and local Steve Collis said neighbours were hoping it 
would be reopened under Mr Enfield’s ownership.

He said: ‘Since its closure there has
been something of a sense of mourning, an unnerving silence and I am 
sure that I speak for many when I say that we long for some life on the 
corner.’

Primrose Hill Lib Dem councillor Chris Naylor said: ‘It is a tragic loss and people will be desperate to save it.’

The plans, filed last week, show the 
building currently has a beer basement, a kitchen and external store. 
The home upstairs, where the former landlord lived, can be reached by a 
separate entrance.

The renovation would include creating a garden and extending the back of the building.
