Jenson Button has called for patience from McLaren's fans as the team head into the unknown following a tough winter of pre-season testing.

Of the nine teams on display over the three four-day tests these past few weeks, McLaren suffered the ignominy of finishing bottom of the pile in terms of kilometres and laps covered.

That was perhaps not too unexpected given the team's switch to Honda power units from this term, with the Japanese manufacturer the new kids on the block and a year behind in development of the complicated system compared to Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault.

The major surprise was just how few laps McLaren managed overall - just 177, less than half of another surprise team in eighth on the list in Red Bull who chalked up 359.

With this weekend's season-opening Australian Grand Prix approaching fast, at present there are doubts as to not only the pace of the McLaren-Honda, but also whether Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen - standing in for Fernando Alonso - will even see the chequered flag.

As ever, though, Button's enthusiasm is boundless as he said: 'I'm so excited to be back in Melbourne.

'After the ups and downs of 2014, I feel the challenge of 2015 is a completely new chapter in my career and I'm totally up for it.

'I also love Melbourne. It's a fantastic city with great people and the atmosphere is always buzzing, and Albert Park is the perfect place for the season-opener.

'While we know the city and the circuit well, what is more of an unknown is how we will fare in the MP4-30.

'McLaren-Honda have been working incredibly hard over the winter, and although we would, of course, have liked to cover more miles in Jerez and Barcelona, I can definitely see a difference in the car from the first day to the last.

'The team's commitment to development and improvement, in Woking and in Japan, is astonishing, and despite some tricky days in testing we are seeing definitive progress.

'The car is a solid base which gives me optimism we will get there, we just need patience.'

Button appreciates this weekend may be a tough one for all the team, but the 35-year-old will be giving it everything to gain a result.

'Melbourne is always a fascinating spectacle, nobody quite knows where they'll be in comparison to their rivals,' added Button

'Even though the other teams are in the second year of the turbo era, all of the development from last year has been done very much behind the scenes, so I don't think anyone has quite shown their full hand yet.

'For us, the race at Albert Park will be a huge learning curve, but I'll be working flat-out with my engineers to get the car set up as best we can.

'Together we'll fight right until the last moment to get the most out of the weekend.'

The fact there is also no Alonso serves as another blow to the team, with the Spaniard advised by doctors not to compete this weekend in the wake of sustaining concussion from a heavy crash in testing.

There are a number of observers who feel not all has been explained as to the reason behind the crash and just why he spent three days in hospital for mild concussion when all tests came back clear.

With Alonso poised to return to the cockpit for the next race later this month in Malaysia, Button said: 'Fernando not being able to race is a real shame.

'I just hope he makes a speedy recovery so that he can get behind the wheel again very soon.

'But it's great to see Kevin back in the car, though, and I know he'll do a great job in Fernando's absence, so I wish him well this weekend.'
