Sam Allardyce was in such a jovial mood after West Ham's penalty shootout win against Everton on Tuesday night that he decided to take the mickey out of Phil Neville on live television.

The West Ham boss, who was speaking alongside Neville on BT Sport, took the opportunity to poke fun at the pundit's inability to make hot drinks.

The former Manchester United man recently admitted that he made his first ever cup of coffee for Sportsmail's chief sports reporter Matt Lawton in December and that he needed advice from his wife Julie to do so.

Allardyce was clearly aware of Neville's shortcomings around the house and, after concluding his live post-match interview, turned to the 37-year-old and said: 'I just want to say one thing... can you make us a coffee?!'

Neville saw the funny side of it and enjoyed a laugh with host Jake Humphrey and fellow pundits David James and Steve McManaman as Allardyce left the pitch-side set.

Describing how he made his first cup of coffee earlier this month, Neville said he 'sprinted into the kitchen' and phoned his wife to ask 'how the hell do I make a cup of coffee?' after Sportsmail's Lawton asked for one during an interview at the couple's £3.6million Cheshire home.

The father of two later told how he made it with a 'kettle… two little scoops of coffee', and laughed: 'I've lived in a bubble all my life.' 

Neville's wife Julie also revealed in a radio interview that he had never used a vacuum cleaner, mop, dishwasher or washing machine.

She added: 'Ironing? Oh gosh no, he wouldn't even know where we keep the ironing board… He wouldn't know how to turn an oven on.

'I've never known anything else and I'm super-domestic so I don't really mind. Phil is an amazing father and husband – just not domesticated in any way.'

Speaking about her husband's first attempt to make a cup of coffee, the 39-year-old said: 'If you'd seen it you would not have thought it was classed as a coffee. I didn't taste it, but it didn't look good.'

But Sportsmail's Lawton was more generous, saying: 'For a first go, it was very good.' 

Earlier this month the former Everton captain laughed at himself by tweeting an image of himself with a vacuum cleaner, a mop and a variety of cleaning products, along with the caption: 'Time to get started......#nescafe'.
