A young mother has told how she feels lucky to be alive after thugs hurled a 2ft slab of  concrete from a bridge on to her car.

Lisa Horne, 26, was on a dual  carriageway heading home after Christmas shopping with her mother when the block slammed into her bonnet and shattered the windscreen.

The incident last Thursday on the A12 near Brentwood, Essex, is being linked to another on the same road less than an hour later which left a woman fighting for her life.

Lucky: Lisa Horne, left, with her mother Stella who was also in the car with her when it was hit by a concrete block. Both women astonishingly escaped uninjured

Police are treating both incidents as attempted murder.

Mother-of-two Miss Horne said: ‘I was
 very lucky to have walked away from it. If I had been travelling 1mph 
faster it might have come straight through the windscreen and things 
would have ended differently.

‘The police are right to describe it as attempted murder.’ 

She added: ‘I can’t understand how anybody could do something like that. They need to be caught to prevent it happening again.’

Weapon: This is the 1ft x 1ft rock which hit Lisa Horne's Vauxhall Astra when it was thrown from Fryerning Bridge near Ingatestone

Damaged: This is the Vauxhall Astra at the roadside after it was hit by the rock while travelling at 55mph. It damaged the bonnet and shattered the top of the windscreen but did not penetrate it so Lisa and Stella escaped uninjured

The second attack, less than three 
miles away, left a 57-year-old passenger fighting for her life with head
 and chest injuries. She is now stable in hospital.

Meanwhile, police in Shrewsbury 
launched an investigation after concrete blocks were dropped from a 
bridge on to a road in the town. A West Mercia Police spokesman said: 
‘Fortunately, no one was hurt.’

Today Miss Horne spoke for the first time about her ordeal. She told a press conference: 'I
 was running low on petrol so I wasn’t driving very fast.

Scene: The attackers threw the rock from this bridge in Ingatestone onto Miss Horne's car. Police are now investigating 30 other incidents since 2008

Feared death: Lisa Horne, 26, swerved across the road after the windscreen of her Vauxhall Astra was smashed by a block thrown from a bridge

'It was as if someone had put their hands over my eyes and I heard a bang and my windscreen just shattered.

'It
 was the loudest bang I’ve ever heard. I swerved across the road and 
luckily I had my mum in the car. She said “Lisa get over to the hard 
shoulder”.

'I couldn’t work out what had come off the bridge. A few cars went past and hit it.'

Terrified: Lisa Horne and her mother Stella fear that if they had been travelling faster than 55mph on the dark road they could have been seriously injured. Miss Horne says she will no longer drive in the dark

Miss Horne added: 'The policeman who was
 there said "You’re very lucky to have walked out of this". Somebody was 
looking down on us that night.

'I’m scared it’s going to happen to someone else and I want them caught. I certainly won’t be driving in the dark.'

She said: 'I cannot understand why someone would do that. I just cannot understand they are just not normal people to do something like that.

'It is not fair, you could have taken peoples' lives away and left my children without a mum.'

Second attack: The interior of the Nissan which was hit by a second concrete block last Thursday on the same stretch of road. A 57-year-old woman is still in hospital after that attack

Smashed: The full extent of the damage to the Nissan car and shattered windscreen can be seen here. Police are treating both attacks as attempted murder

Her mother Stella told the press conference that she could not understand the mentality of the thugs who hurled the rock.

'I just don't know how they went home that night and slept,' she said.'They could have killed four people within half an hour.

'I just don't understand how people could do that. I cannot sleep thinking about it.'

Essex Police say a 2ft block, which
 smashed through the windscreen of the Nissan, may have been used as a bollard at a 
nearby house.

Scene of attack: Police on West Hanningfield Bridge over the A12, where the second concrete block was thrown onto a Nissan car

Officers are examining clues from  a 
forensic examination of both bridges. Detectives are also looking into 
more than 30 similar incidents from the past three years to identify any
 links.

The force has increased patrols in the area and is appealing for information from the public.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Keith Davies said: ‘Even a stone thrown from a bridge 
can be fatal, but  when you look at the size of this concrete, it is 
amazing that the consequences were not far, far worse.’

Appeal: Police and press at West Hanningfield Bridge in Essex after the second attack last Thursday. Police are calling on witnesses with any information to come forward

Last night the road was closed again after someone thought they saw someone throwing a block from a nearby bridge.

However, after finding nothing suspicious during a search of the area, police later reopened the road.

A spokesman from Essex Police said: 'This was a genuine report and we would encourage such calls.

'We
 are sorry for the disruption. But motorists and the surrounding 
communities understand that safety is of paramount importance as is 
catching the perpetrators behind these attacks.'

Danger area: The red pin at Ingatestone is the scene of the first attack
 and the second red pin is the bridge at West Hanningfield. The blue pin
 indicates where a suspected attacker was seen on Sunday but this has 
now been discounted
