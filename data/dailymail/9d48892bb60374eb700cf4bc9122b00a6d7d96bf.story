The only English professional footballer ever to be awarded the Victoria Cross is being given a new memorial almost 100 years after he died.

Donald Bell, the first of 2,000 footballers to enlist in the First World War, was honoured by George V after he dashed across open ground to attack a German machine gun post and killed 50 men.

The full-back with Crystal Palace, Newcastle United and Bradford Park Avenue - who told his mother the victory was the 'biggest fluke alive' - was killed just five days later in a similar assault.

Hero: Donald Bell, pictured before and after war broke out, was the first of 2,000 footballers to enlist in the First World War and the only English professional footballer ever to be awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery

Honour: Bell's memorial near Contalmaison, France (pictured when it was unveiled in 2000 with Bell's great niece Joanna Umpleby) will be renovated and have a new headstone and plaque commemorating his efforts

Now the memorial that was erected to him near the French village of Contalmaison, on a spot renamed Bell's Redoubt, is gaining a new memorial stone and plaque honouring his efforts.

It comes four years after the Professional Footballers' Association bought his medal at auction for £252,000 - at the time the third highest price ever paid for a VC.

Valuable: Bell's VC was auctioned for £252,000

The second lieutenant in the 9th Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment, crossed the English Channel in June 1915 and reached the Western Front before the Battle of the Somme.

Before the war he had played as an amateur with Crystal Palace and Newcastle before signing with Bradford Park Avenue, who he helped win promotion to the First Division.

On July 5 1916, Bell's battalion - known as the Green Howards - was given orders to capture a German position known as Horseshoe Trench near the French village of Contalmaison.

Disregarding his own safety, he crept up on a communication trench and dashed across open ground to attack the German machine gun post.

Bell then killed the gunner with his revolver, blew up several more soldiers with hand grenades and threw more bombs into a dugout, killing 50 of the enemy.

In a letter to his mother, the modest soldier from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, wrote: 'I must confess that it was the biggest fluke alive and I did nothing. I chucked the bomb and it did the trick.'

He added: 'I believe God is watching over me and it rests with him whether I pull through or not.'

But Bell was killed just five days later as his battalion attacked another machine gun post.

Described by officers as having 'the courage of a lion', Bell was buried near Contalmaison after the war. His body was later moved but a permanent memorial was erected about 20 yards from where he fell in 2000.

Fitting memorial: The new stone honouring Bell, pictured being finished by Neil Collinson, contains an account of his bravery in battle in English and French. It will be placed near the French village of Contalmaison

Mr Collinson said: 'Some of the guys feel we have got to know Donald Bell. We have been totally enthralled'

He was given Britain's highest military honour posthumously to remember his efforts.

Incredibly one of his closest friends from Harrogate Grammar School, Archie White, was also awarded the Victoria Cross for his gallantry in the 6th Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment.

A report in the London Gazette in September 1916 praised Bell's 'most conspicuous bravery'.

When Lord Kitchener launched his famous 'Your Country Needs You' campaign, tens of thousands of men enlisted.

But the FA was slower to take up the challenge. Despite opposition, matches were played throughout the 1914-15 season and the FA Cup was held as normal.

Many teams, however, grasped their sense of duty with both hands.

In November 1914, Hearts of Midlothian were leading the First Division when 16 players left mid-season to fight in the Great War - becoming the first professional team to enlist en masse.

The men were part of the First and 16th Royal Scots who fought in the vicious Battle of the Somme, which killed three members of the team.

Losing seven men altogether was not the only reason Hearts became heroes. It was said that their bold mass sacrifice of pitches the trenches inspired other footballers to do the same.

A memorial erected to the team in 1922  still stands in Haymarket, Edinburgh.

It read: 'This very brave act saved many lives and ensured the success of the attack. Five days later this very gallant officer lost his life after performing a very similar act of bravery.'

Now, in the centenary year of the war's outbreak, the Friends of the Green Howards have arranged for a new memorial stone to be placed where he died.

A new plaque will read: 'Second Lieutenant Donald S Bell was awarded the Victoria Cross for attacking and destroying an enemy machine gun post on 5th July 1916 at Horseshoe Trench, one kilometre to the west of this memorial thus saving many lives.

'Five days later he lost his life at this location whilst performing a similar act, contributing to the success of the attack and the capture of this village.

'Later this place was officially named Bell's Redoubt.

'Donald Bell was the first English professional footballer to enlist in 1914 and the only player to be awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy.'

The work has been funded by the Professional Footballers' Association and the stone will be erected this summer.

Neil Collinson, the owner of stonemasons Dales of Thirsk, said: 'We have been thrilled to be part of the project.

'Some of the guys have been looking through the details and feel that we have got to know Donald Bell. They have been totally enthralled by his story.'

Before the war Bell trained to be a teacher at Westminster College in London and was made assistant master at Starbeck Council School near Harrogate.
