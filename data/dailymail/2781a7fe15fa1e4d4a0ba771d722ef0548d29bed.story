Officers have appealed for a helping hand in order to catch a bearded bandit responsible for a string of burglaries in Victoria.

The man has had a few close shaves at various factories south-east of Melbourne, breaking in to three separate industrial areas over the past few months.

Victoria Police said CCTV cameras were damaged each time the bearded burglar broke in, but they did manage to snap some pictures of him first.

The man is pictured in one shot in a baseball cap, glasses, and what looks to be a fake beard. He is described by police as being of Caucasian appearance.

He can be seen wearing gloves and holding an instruments up the the camera - possibly being used to destroy it.

In another image the burglar is sans beard wearing a hooded jumped, staring right down the lens.

The first incident was on May 20 around 5am, and occurred at a factory on Simcock Street in Somerville, about 50 kilometres south-east of Melbourne's CBD.

Here the man, believed to be between 18 and 25 years of age, damaged one of the CCTV cameras.

The second incident took place on 17 June at the same place, with the same damage to one of the cameras.

The most recent crime undertaken by the bearded burglar was on August 1, in an industrial area in Carrum Downs - about 35 kilometres south-east of Melbourne.

The young man damaged yet another CCTV camera around 2am, though there's no word on what he took with him as a souvenir.
