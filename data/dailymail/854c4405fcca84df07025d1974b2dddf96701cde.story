A young mother took selfies of herself with her boyfriend while he was on the run for leaving a pensioner to die following a burglary, a court heard.

Beverley Hardman, 25, also helped Daniel Crompton, 24, evade capture during a police manhunt by acting as his 'eyes on the ground,' it was alleged.

Yesterday a jury at Manchester Crown Court heard that she hid Crompton in her home from detectives and then drove  Crompton to a friend's house using a story that the pair had fallen out and needed some time apart.

Earlier, Crompton had attacked 87-year old widower Frank Worsley during a raid when the pensioner awoke to find him in his bedroom standing over him and demanding cash.

During the attack Crompton wrapped his vest around his fist and punched him repeatedly around the face before fleeing with his wallet and bank book.

The victim, a grandfather-of-two, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, died in hospital less than three weeks later. Crompton was subsequently convicted of murder.

Hardman, a mother-of-one, admitted knowing Crompton had burgled the house of a nearby acquaintance on the night of August 3 last year but denied having any knowledge of the attack on Mr Worsley.

But the jury were shown phone transcripts where she asked her boyfriend 'where are the passports?' after police came knocking.

Prosecuting, Rob Hall said: 'On the face of it this suggests they are going to get out of the Bolton area completely. Is that the sort of response you might expect of a boyfriend and girlfriend as a consequence of the knowledge of just one burglary where a touch screen computer was taken? Or a burglary where an 87-year-old man was beaten to the point where he died a few weeks later?'

They were also shown 'selfies' the pair snapped together hours after the robbery of widower Mr Worsley - which prove her 'motivation' for hiding him, it was said.

Mr Hall added: 'Her loyalty was such she wanted to protect him at all costs, possibly even ahead of her own self.

'There is a snapshot of the state of mind between them through two photos taken on her phone. At 5.17am on August 3 you can quite clearly see the defendant and Daniel Crompton.

'The Crown say of these photographs that whatever difficulties there might have been from the relationship, they were surmounted by the strength of the bond between the two of them.

'When one is hoping to consider the motivation to help Daniel Crompton avoid the police and avoid responsibility for what he has done, these two photos demonstrate this defendant's attitude at a time so shortly after two burglaries and an assault - and you will be assessing this defendant's knowledge of those events - but these two photos do give some insight into the mood that morning.'

The court heard Crompton went to a friend's house minutes after the robbery of Mr Worsley where Hardman was believed to be present. He was showing signs of a 'scuffle' and with stolen items in hand. He was confronted as to where they had come from, so he left the house and returned a short time later, saying he had binned them.

Police first visited Hardman's home on August 4 when the victims of another burglary during which a computer and TV were stolen pointed them in Crompton's direction.

But the couple kept their heads down and didn't answer the door, before Hardman took her boyfriend to the home of his friend Ryan Holman in a different area of Bolton, it was said.

Police called again later that day and Hardman this time answered. The house was searched and she was asked where her boyfriend was but lied and said she didn't know.

She then travelled to the flat Crompton was staying in, when he sent her a text saying: 'don't mention anything about anything when you get here xxxx'.

The jury heard a 'tracker' device fitted to her Vauxhall Corsa by her insurance company to monitor mileage had recorded her movements.

Days after the burglary incident, police again turned up to Miss Hardman's home on Caverleigh Close, Bolton, and explicitly told her that her boyfriend had violently robbed an 87-year-old man in his own home, it was said.

But Mr Hall added: 'She was not showing any of the sense of surprise you might expect if your knowledge was more limited. They arrested her and at that point there was a one second call from Mr Crompton to the defendant and then a text from Miss Hardman to him to say 'ring me', in the throes of the officers asking questions.

'Both of the defendant's mobile phones were seized. What followed was Daniel Crompton repeatedly telephoning the defendant's phones in an attempt to find out what was going on. She was, after all, his eyes on the ground.'

The jury heard police examined a 'tracker' device fitted to her Vauxhall Corsa by her insurance company to monitor mileage and it recorded her movements. She told police after she was arrested following their third visit she had driven to Wigan, but the device showed her repeatedly driving across Bolton, it was alleged.

Crompton was eventually arrested at Mr Holman's home on August 5 where he was later charged with robbery and remanded in custody. Mr Worsley died on August 20 which meant Hardman had to be called back to the station for interview nine days later - to which she answered 'no comment' or remained silent to all questions.

Hardman denies assisting an offender. The trial continues.
