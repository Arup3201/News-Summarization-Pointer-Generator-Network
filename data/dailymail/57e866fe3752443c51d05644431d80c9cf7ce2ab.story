Leon Osman is hoping to give Everton a lift by returning from injury after 11 weeks out on Tuesday.

Osman, 33, has not played since a bizarre injury where he split a tendon in his foot during the game with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on December 6, which Everton lost 1-0.

The England international feared he would miss most of the season but has worked hard to get himself back ahead of schedule and is hoping to figure for Everton Under 21s against Manchester United at Leigh Sports Village.

Osman's return could provide Everton with a timely boost.

Roberto Martinez's side are five points above the relegation zone but victory over the Premier League's bottom club Leicester on Sunday at Goodison park will appease any worries about the drop.

Everton are still in the Europa League and take on Young Boys of Bern in Switzerland in the first leg of the last 32 of the tournament on Thursday.
