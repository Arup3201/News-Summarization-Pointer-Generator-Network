Nina Parsons is set to undergo surgery in the US after well-wishers raised  £70,000

A young woman whose brain stem is being gradually crushed by her skull is set to undergo life changing surgery.

Nina Parsons' suffers from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which is causing her head to sink into her neck.

Her condition is so severe that she has shrunk an inch and a half in the last two years - dropping from 5ft 5½in to just 5ft 4in. 

The rare agonising condition, which weakens the collagen in her body, means that the former make-up artist spends most of the day confined to her bed. 

However, she is now set to have  specialist fusion surgery in the US after well-wishers raised £70,000 to fund the operation.

'The treatment I need to make me better is not available in this country, the skills are just not there,' said Miss Parsons, from Stapenhill, Staffordshire. 

'Through the campaign some amazing companies and people have come forward to help and I say a huge 'thank you' to them all.

She told how she has lost her home, business and partner because of the illness, which leaves her in constant pain.

 'The long-term prognosis is deterioration resulting in seizures drop attacks and eventually paralysis. 

'The smallest journey is living hell, inflicting vibration and jarring to my body, so even hospital appointments are huge pain filled ordeals.'

'I wear a cervical collar a large proportion of the time to enforce restricted movements. Sudden movement and over stressing my ligaments and joints could be catastrophic.

 'As a young confident woman in her twenties, I had built a successful beauty business that was going from strength to strength.

'But I was unable to sustain the rigorous demands required to run a business and had to let it go.

'This in turn also meant the loss of my home and my livelihood.

'I was engaged for two years but the relationship also succumbed to the stress and demands of my illness and we separated.

'I am now all but housebound and live with my hugely supportive parents.

Miss Parsons believes that the surgery is  her 'last and only chance'

'Even within a home environment it is almost impossible to undertake or do day-to-day tasks most of us take for granted.

'This is due to almost 24 hour pain, severe migraines, neurological problems, not being able to focus or move my eyes, numbness, weakness, pain that radiates from behinds my eyes and the back of the skull, from my neck into my shoulders and arms and further down my spine.

'To compound the problem, my solace from pain relief is compromised as I have an allergic reaction to morphine and many opiates. My body is slowly closing down and many of my waking hours I am confined to my bed.'

EDS affects one in 5,000 people in the UK and renders itself very differently in each individual.

'Despite not knowing for years, I was actually born with EDS and lived with it my entire life.

'It meant for many of my early years I would bruise very easily, suffer dislocations and other injures that, at the time, went unexplained.

'It was when I hit the age of 23 that serious problems started to manifest and knew that I would have to seek out help and advice from doctors and consultants.

'However, my diagnosis was very vague and put my problems down to a range of issues from anxiety to psychological issues.

'I was offered counselling and anti-depressants at the time but knew that this would not solve the problem.

'I carried on as I was until I was around 26 when the situation became quite serious and I began to suffer from quite serious sickness and nausea.

'My weight dropped dramatically and my hair began to fall out as I could no longer eat solid food.

Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a collection of inherited conditions, known as heritable disorders of connective tissue.

Connective tissues provide support in skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bones.

There are different types of EDS, which can cause:

The fragile skin and unstable joints may be the result of faulty collagen.

Collagen is a protein in connective tissue that acts as a 'glue' in the body, adding strength and elasticity.

The different types of EDS are caused by alterations in certain genes that make collagen weaker.

In some cases the amount of collagen in the body is reduced.

The faulty genes can be passed from parents to their children.

'Then, soon after, issues started to emerge regarding my movement, vision and then vertigo set in.'

Nina decided to carry on with her work as a make-up artist for brides but it was when she reached the age of 28 that her life and health took a dramatic turn for the worse.

'I fell down the stairs and suffered a whiplash injury to my neck. I also had major damage to ligaments and bones,' she added.

'I started to suffer excruciating migraines and constant headaches that have not stopped since.

'This was when I was formally diagnosed with EDS. My lust for life has drained from me.'

Miss Parsons was left shell shocked by the diagnoses and pain and suffering that came with it but she was defiant that she would beat this problem, only to learn that salvation would be hard to come by. 

The nature of EDS frequently leads to other related illnesses such as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and Craniocervical Instability (CCI).

'CCI manifestations are complex, it is often described as 'pumpkin on a tooth pick syndrome,' she said.

'Put simply, my ligaments do not support my spine, my spine moves, my head slides and wobbles and my brainstem is stretched and compressed and is causing catastrophic damage to my body.

'Each movement I make causes more and more damage, resulting in more impairment and generating more disabilities. I am constantly bed ridden and I am in so much pain.'

The surgery Miss Parsons is due to undergo in the US is major and there are risks attached, but it has a 95 per cent success rate.  

'What I have and the pain I suffer is similar to what people suffer when they have injured their body following a major car crash.'
