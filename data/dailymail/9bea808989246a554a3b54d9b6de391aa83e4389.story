Shot dead: This South American rhea was on the loose in Hertfordshire for almost two months

The giant South American rhea that has evaded capture for more than a month has been shot - and will be turned into gourmet sausages.

Gamekeeper Stuart Howe, 65, spotted the 6ft flightless bird 70 yards away in a rape seed field and killed it with one shot to the head.

The rhea, named Rita, had become a frequent sight 
on Barkway Park Golf Club near Royston, Hertfordshire. But with a top 
speed of 45mph, its pursuers were never able to get close.

And since the six-inch claws of the female bird were said to be capable of disembowelling a grown man, many people did not want to try.

But police had grown concerned the rhea, which escaped in mid-March from a smallholding belonging to experienced rhea owner Jo Clark in Starling's Green, Essex, would cause a car crash.

Gamekeeper Mr Howe provided photographic of evidence of the dead bird, which some nicknamed Chris after the pop legend Chris Rea.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'I suppose some people might say it is a shame the rhea is dead but it would be terrible if it caused someone to die in a car crash.

'I saw the rhea near the roadside at one point and it would easily have caused a car to swerve and hit a tree.

'Whatâ€™s the life of a bird against the life of a person or family? The police wanted it out of the way and there was no way anyone would be able to capture it.'

The flightless bird resembling something between an ostrich and an emu was the butt of countless 'birdie' jokes after it made frequent appearances on the golf course.

But it was deadly serious for the RSPCA, which issued a warning to residents not to approach Rita.

A spokesman said: 'Rheas are large birds 
and have the potential to be dangerous as they are strong, fast and have
 sharp claws. Our advice to the general public is keep well away and 
call us or the police if they see the bird.

Harmless? The bird was spotted several times roaming the countryside, including in this rape seed field

'We would not recommend that anyone attempts to restrain or catch a rhea themselves, as these birds are able to kick in any direction and may kick out if they feel threatened.'

Local newspapers printed advice to residents on what they should do if confronted under the headline 'rhea guard action'.

And one person searching for the bird, Jane Garner, said she had received a phone call from a mystery man three weeks ago warning her he would shoot the rhea on sight.

She told the BBC: 'I implored him not to - it's doing no harm and there are lots of people badly trying to find a way to catch it.'

A Hertfordshire Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'Police have received notification that the missing Rhea has been lawfully killed near a carriageway in Anstey, as there was fear of it getting onto a main road and causing a collision.

'The owner had previously given permission for the bird to be dispatched if the situation deemed it necessary, which was the case.

'We have spoken to the owner who is aware.'
