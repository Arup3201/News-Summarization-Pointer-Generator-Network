Electronic cigarette makers are in a race to design and buy new variations of the technology after becoming a billion-dollar industry.

China is the front runner in the manufacture and development of so-called e-cigarette technology, as it's a country with over 300 million smokers.

New
versions being patented include a 'pay as you go'
computer-assisted device and others that can deliver caffeine
instead.

In 2005 just eight e-cigarette inventions were described in
published patents. By 2012 the figure had jumped to 220.

By last year there were over 500 inventions, according to an
analysis by the IP & Science business of Thomson Reuters. So far
this year the total has reached 650. (A single invention may be
covered by several patents.)

The original technology, involving battery-powered heating
systems that vaporise nicotine-laced liquid, is credited to Hon
Lik, a Chinese medical researcher with a 20-a-day habit, in
2003.

His invention has since become so popular that the market is
now estimated to be worth $3.5 billion. 

Both big tobacco firms
and small entrepreneurs are falling over themselves to find new
ways to 'vape' - a verb suddenly so mainstream the Oxford
English Dictionary named it 2014's Word of the Year.

Imperial Tobacco last year snapped up the patents
owned by the company Hon co-founded in a deal worth $75 million,
and is suing rivals for a range of alleged patent infringements.

Part of the rush to create new devices can be explained by
the prospect of stiffer regulation on existing ones after the
World Health Organization said it wanted to see this, along with
bans on indoor use, advertising and sales to minors.

While proponents see e-cigarettes as important tools for
harm reduction, critics fear the devices may instead fuel a new
wave of nicotine addiction and cite a lack of long-term
scientific evidence to support their safety. 

Of more than 2,000 e-cigarette inventions tracked by Thomson
Reuters, 64 percent originate in China, where over half of men
smoke. In second place is the United States, with 14 percent,
followed by South Korea with 9 percent.

Some patented suggestions target smokers looking to regulate
their nicotine intake and their spending. While offerings
already on the market include thousands of e-liquid flavours
from menthol to marshmallow, and even a smartphone app to show
how much you are using, new patents go a step further.

Tobacco giant Philip Morris International describes
an e-cigarette that would allow users to 'pay as you go' by
buying a certain number of doses via computer application
connected to their e-cigarette.

Customers could also programme
the device to shut off after a certain number of puffs per use
to help limit intake.

Other smaller players aim to deliver doses of caffeine and
other additives instead of nicotine.

A unit of mCig Inc sells VitaCigs containing
vitamins and supplements such as valerian and collagen, while a
company called Energy Shisha sells a caffeinated vaping stick.
Patents filed by others, including Fuma International, mention
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active chemical in cannabis.

In general, e-cigarette patents relate to systems for
heating and vaporising liquids, as well as for charging the
electronic systems, whether in a 'cigalike' device or a larger
'tank' system, which doesn't resemble a cigarette but gives a
better 'vaping' experience.

China's domination of the market reflects not only its huge
number of smokers but also a wider drive by the Chinese
government to forge a knowledge economy. By maximising patents
it hopes to replace the ubiquitous 'Made in China' label by
'Designed in China.'

Since 2011, China has been the world's top patent filer for
all inventions, according to the World Intellectual Property
Office. Its scientists and companies now lay claim to
intellectual property rights on everything from telecoms to
medicine.

'Patenting globally is rising significantly year on year,
driven by Chinese patenting generally,' said Bob Stembridge,
senior patent analyst at Thomson Reuters IP & Science.

'But I would say the e-cigarette field is growing faster
than the general trend, and the bias toward China is greater
than in global patenting.'
