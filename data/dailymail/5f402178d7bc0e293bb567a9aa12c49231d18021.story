She's a mainstay on glossy magazine covers and is even the face of Bulgari jewellery. And now, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has revealed why she loves the limelight. 

The singer opened up in an interview ahead of the release of a TV documentary on her musical tour across the US and France.

She explained that she has an obsession with 'exhibiting' and it's down to a part of her that is 'a bit rotten, alone or infantile'.

Speaking to Le Parisien newspaper, she said: 'It's as if there is an inconsistency in who I am, an uncertainty of being alive that pushes me to exhibit myself.

'It's a part of me that is a bit rotten, alone or infantile that needs this.

'I don't know where this devouring need for recognition comes from. I think it is because I am a b*****d. Otherwise I wouldn't put myself through all of this.'

Carla, 47, is legally the daughter Marisa Borini - a concert pianist - and composer Alberto Bruni Tedeschi. 

It was revealed in 2008, in an interview with Vanity Fair, that her biological father is actually a grocery entrepreneur called Maurizio Remmert from Italy. 

Carla was the result of a six-year affair he had with her mother, then 19.

The model-turned-singer also discussed her rise to stardom and dismissed claims that her well-connected family helped her on her way.

She may be the heiress to a lucrative tyre company founded by her legal grandfather in 1920, but Carla insists that she 'struggled' to succeed, particularly due to her shyness.

Signed at the tender age of 19, she went on to model for Guess? jeans, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Paco Rabanne,  Yves Saint-Laurent, Chanel and Versace.

So popular was she that in the early 1990s, she was one of the highest-paid fashion models in the world, attracting the affections of Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger.

Despite modelling commitments, Bruni's energy is focused on her singing career and a world tour

Years later, her successes show no signs of abating.

Carla, a former model turned chanteuse, is the current face of Bulgari and has appeared in several campaigns for the jewellery brand.

Despite her modelling commitments, most of Bruni's energy is currently being directed at her singing career and a world tour that has already stopped off in Vienna, Berlin, Aix-en-Provence, New York, Quebec and Los Angeles.

She has also been spending more time with her daughter Giulia, three, who was born while her husband Nicholas Sarkozy was still president of France.

In fact, Sarkozy has been elected as head of the conservative party leaving him clear to launch a campaign to return as the country's leader in 2017.

He was under pressure to win the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) leadership by a wide margin and received 64.5 per cent of the vote, well ahead of his nearest rival Bruno le Marie.

This victory advances Mr Sarkozy's hopes of running in the presidential race, and cements his return to the political scene after losing to Francois Hollande more than two years ago.

Speaking about his return to politics, she said: 'I trust him. It doesn't bother me. He doesn't get in my way and I don't have a problem with the life that comes with it.'

Happy for him: Nicolas Sarkozy has been elected as head of the conservative party leaving him clear to launch a campaign to return as the country's leader in 2017 and Carla says it 'doesn't bother' her
