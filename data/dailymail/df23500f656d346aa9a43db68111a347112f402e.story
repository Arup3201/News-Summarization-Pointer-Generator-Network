A series of gruesome videos of damaged lungs have recently been released as part of an anti-smoking campaign.

The footage was aired on Chinese television channel CCTV last Wednesday, warning long-term smokers and passive smokers of the dangers of tobacco smoke.

The short clips show a close up of lungs which have been blackened by mould-like spots.

A series of gruesome videos of damaged lungs have recently been released as part of a Chinese anti-smoking campaign

The videos, which were shared through chinaSMACK on Friday, show the grave effects of tobacco smoke.

The caption for the footage reads: 'Over 80 per cent of lung cancer cases are believed to be caused by long-term smoking or "second hand smoke"!'

'In the images, the lung of someone who has smoked for 15 years is covered with large black spots, while the lung of a 30-year smoker is even more of a ghastly sight, where even the inside is covered with cancer causing substances.'

China is believed to be the world's largest producer and consumer of tobacco products, according to the World Health Organisation.

There are more than 300 million smokers in China while about one in every three cigarettes smoked in the world is smoked in the country 

More than one million people die in China ever tear due to tobacco while an estimated 100,000 people die as a result of exposure to second-hand smoke

There are more than 300 million smokers in China while about one in every three cigarettes smoked in the world is smoked in the country.

There are about 700 million people who are regularly exposed to second-hand smoke.

More than one million people die in China ever year due to tobacco while an estimated 100,000 people die as a result of second-hand smoke.

This means someone in China dies about every 30 seconds due to tobacco use which equates to about 3000 people every day.

WHO warns if China's widespread use of tobacco is not reduced, the number of deaths relating to tobacco each year will increase to three million by 2050 in China.
