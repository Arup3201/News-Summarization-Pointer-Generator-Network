A new mother's cervical cancer went undiagnosed for 14 months because doctors thought the symptoms were related to her pregnancy.

Shelley Maye,  from Newbury, Berkshire, had been suffering from extreme tiredness, back ache, bleeding after intercourse and sickness.

But it wasn't until her baby, Jenson, was four- months-old, that the 34-year-old received the devastating news that she had advanced cervical cancer.

The mother-of-two was told the disease had already spread to the surrounding tissue and a hysterectomy would no longer work as there was not enough healthy tissue to perform the operation.

'I don't want to die': Mrs Maye said she was terrified when she was diagnosed with cancer as she was newly married to husband Andrew and they had two young children together

After a gruelling six weeks of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and brachytherapy - where a radiation source is placed near to the cancer - Mrs Maye is now waiting to see if the treatment has worked.

She said she knew something was wrong as she was experiencing symptoms that had not been present when she was pregnant with her first child.

But she was reassured by professionals who she claims told her the symptoms were the result of her pregnancy.

She said: 'My pregnancy was awful, I knew there was something terribly wrong.

'I suffered for fourteen months before my cervical cancer was diagnosed.

'It had already spread by that point and it destroyed our hopes of having any more children in the future.

'I was also terrified that I had passed cancer on to my baby.

'I knew the pain and bleeding after intercourse wasn't normal but when medical professionals reassure you that its pregnancy-related you trust their judgement.

Unusual bleeding

In most cases, vaginal bleeding is the first noticeable symptom of cervical cancer. It usually occurs after having sex.

Bleeding at any other time, other than your expected monthly period, is also considered unusual.

This includes bleeding after the menopause (when a woman's monthly periods stop).

If you have any type of unusual vaginal bleeding, visit your GP for advice.

Other symptoms of cervical cancer may include:

Advanced cervical cancer:

If the cancer spreads out of your cervix and into surrounding tissue and organs, it can trigger a range of other symptoms, including:

'I never imagined I was suffering from cervical cancer, I had never missed a single smear test.'

Doctors also told Mrs Maye they had found a 7cm benign tumour on her kidney, which will be removed during an operation scheduled for later this year. 

She said it was terrifying being diagnosed and is on edge, waiting to find out if treatment has worked.

'I don't want to die, I have only just got married to Andrew and we have two young children together,' Mrs Maye said.

'We are all waiting for the all-clear now, my specialist has told me that the intense treatment is working but we won't know if I'm cancer free until two months time.'

A healthcare professional thought Mrs Maye was suffering from the baby blues.

But having been through one pregnancy already, Mrs Maye believed something else must be wrong.

When she was finally given a smear test she was told by the nurse that she was bleeding internally.

Three days later specialists revealed they had found abnormal cells.

Mrs Maye, said: 'When I went to have my biopsy done they told me that they were 99.9 per cent sure it was cancer and they were right.

'Andrew and I just broke down, it was devastating.'

But after months of treatment, Mrs Maye, husband Andrew, and their two boys, Bradley, two and Jenson, now nine-months, are hoping for a cancer-free Christmas.

Mrs Maye said: 'My next follow up with my consultant is October 6, the same day as my husbands 40th. 

'I'll find out if my cancer has gone at the end of the year. We need some positive news after what has been the worst year imaginable.

'I hope other women, pregnant or not, read my story and look-out for the symptoms of cervical cancer.

'I'm lucky I was diagnosed before it was too late but I want others to realise that you don't just have to be up to date with your smears to avoid getting the disease.'

Mrs Maye and her family have been supported throughout their journey by a charity called Mummy's Star - set up by Pete Wallroth after losing his wife Mair to cancer, one month after giving birth.

Mrs Maye says her pregnancy was 'awful' and she knew something was wrong, but healthcare professionals reassured her the symptoms were related to her pregnancy

Mr Wallroth, founder and CEO of Mummy's Star said: 'Receiving a cancer diagnosis either during pregnancy or shortly after a birth is a situation that affects women across the UK every year but yet which there is very little awareness of or recognition.

'The trauma and challenges this places on a family are devastating, during a time when they should be excited about the prospect of a new birth or celebrating a new arrival.

'After Shelley got in touch with Mummy's Star and explained her situation in June this year we were able to help her in terms of emotional support by being able to speak to other women regularly who shared many of the experiences she was having and yet faced through our confidential forum.'

He added: 'In additional I am glad to say that we were able to help her with some of the additional nursery fees that her family were incurring due to her treatment. This gave her peace of mind knowing that her children were safe in the surroundings of a place they knew and trusted'

MailOnline has contacted the GP practice and local health authority involved but has yet to receive a response.
