A Belgium enthusiast has created one of the world's weirdest and most wonderful hotels where you can spend the night inside a Trojan horse or even sleep with a mermaid.

La Balade Des Gnomes, near the picturesque town of Durbuy, in Belgium, offers guests a unique experience where they can unwind in an imaginary world.

The
fairytale resort is comprised of extraordinarily unique bedrooms from a
spaceship in a lunar landscape to a troll's habitat complete with 
running stream and goldfish.

Mythical: The 'Cheval de Troie' (Trojan Horse) suite at the magical La Balade Des Gnomes hotel in Belgium

You can even share a room with a mermaid floating in a pool on a yacht.

The owner Dominique Noel took inspiration from the four corners of the world and created the innovative abode an unassuming farmhouse.

Mr Noel, an architect, said: 'The hotel was created by people who have a strong interest in nature.

'It is built from completely natural materials and celebrates the simplicity of modern times.

Accommodation: The interior of the Trojan Horse offers a unique mix of comfort and craziness

Mod cons: It might be based on a Greek myth but you can still unwind in a wooden jacuzzi bath

'I wanted the hotel to be almost imaginary, with a youthful essence and work harmoniously with nature.'

La Balade Des Gnomes was built to compliment Mr Noel's restaurant, La Gargouille, which is conveniently placed next door.

Mr Noel charges between £50 - £125 a night for the rooms which he believes excite guests and offer them a unique staying experience.
