Abbey Clancy's impressively toned physique would usually inspire negative thoughts in the minds of women across the UK.

But it is tough to harbour any ill will towards the model for this latest set of pictures as the 28-year-old is modelling the latest range of Ultimo lingerie to raise money for Breast Cancer Care. 

The underwear company has launched a new set of the popular Mollie style that comes in the colour pink and costs £24 for the bra and £12 for a pair of briefs.

Abbey Clancy is modelling the new pink Mollie range by Ultimo, who will contribute £1 of every sale to Breast Cancer Care 

The Mollie range costs £24 for a bra and £12 for a pair of briefs 

£1 from the sale of every item during October - Breast Cancer Awareness Month - goes to charity. 

Michelle Mone OBE, founder of Ultimo, said: 'Ultimo is all about celebrating women, so we felt it important to get behind Breast Cancer Awareness month and do something special for a hugely worthy cause. 

'Breast Cancer Care is the only UK-wide support charity that helps the thousands of women waking up to the harsh reality of breast cancer every day.  

'Complete with a branded motif at the centre, ‘The One’ bra cup features a secret sling that works to remove the “double boob” effect, creating a beautifully rounded and natural-looking cleavage.'  

The range Abbey is modelling has been launched especially for Breast Cancer Awareness Month
