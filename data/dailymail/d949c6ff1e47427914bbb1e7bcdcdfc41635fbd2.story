Fatal infection: Harry Mould died four days after he was admitted to hospital

A five-year-old asthma sufferer admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties died within five days after a string of shortcomings, an inquest heard.

Harry Mould’s family claim he was not checked enough by overworked staff or given medication when he needed it.

He was so breathless on admission that he had to be given oxygen and treated with nebulisers, which turn liquid drugs into a spray to be more easily inhaled.

The inquest heard the ‘gifted and talented’ boy, from Greenleys, Buckinghamshire, initially seemed to improve after being given the nebulisers every hour.

Consultant Abraham Oommen then changed this to using an inhaler.

He said he observed Harry for ‘about 15-20 minutes’ before his decision in March 2009.

The doctor also did not order an X-ray for a suspected chest infection.

He admitted Harry, who died of a respiratory infection, ‘did not receive the treatment he should have’

Consultant paediatrician Oommen said: 'The general impression was that he seemed to be improving.

'He was alert, he seemed quite comfortable.

'He seemed reasonably well.

'I was speaking to his mother about (Harry) going home.'

He said he had ordered Harry to be treated every two hours with an inhaler, but  Donald Coutts-Wood, the Deputy Coroner for Leicester City and South Lincolnshire,  pointed out: 'it doesn't say that anywhere in the notes', which  recorded that Harry should have the treatment ever four hours.

When asked by Mr Coutts-Wood why he did not keep Harry on the nebulisers, Dr  Oommen replied: ‘I thought he was an older child who would cope well with an  inhaler. It can be seen as a more gentle treatment.'

The consultant said he arranged for Harry to  be reviewed again by a colleague at 3pm, although the coroner again pointed out  that 'this was not documented anywhere.'

The colleague found Harry 'did not look as well as he had that morning' and had needed to be given oxygen to breathe.

Harry was then put back on the nebuliser treatment.

By 6pm, Harry was assessed as needing ‘frequent’ observations from medics, but  was not seen again until 9pm. 

Dr Oommen agreed that he ‘would have expected more’ than three-hourly  observations of the boy, given his condition.

The court heard Dr Oommen also prescribed a course of antibiotics over a  ‘suspicion’ Harry had a chest infection, but did not order a chest X-ray to investigate this further. 

As Harry’s condition worsened, the court heard he needed four doses from the nebuliser over a three-hour period, but only received three.

Pathologist Dr David O'Neil told the hearing the youngster had at some point  during his treatment suffered a brain injury, which could have caused Harry to  not respond to treatment as well as he should. 

The inquest, which is expected to last 14 days, continues.

Speaking before the hearing began, Harry’s parents, Lee, a data engineer, and  Odette, both 33, described him as a ‘lovely boy, our little ray of sunshine. 

Mrs Mould has since had another son, Isaac, aged 18-months.
