And to think this was not deemed attractive enough for television.

What more do they want? The League One conquerors of Chelsea versus another terrified top-flight opponent, old boys rejected by Sunderland with a score to settle, a deafening capacity crowd and a pitch which even cattle would turn their noses up at.

And boy, did it deliver — a beautifully ugly contest, blood, studs and thunder from the off.

Managers Phil Parkinson and Gus Poyet agreed on two things — Bradford’s victory was deserved and the ferocity of the tie was from a bygone era. But there was romance, too. For ex-Black Cat Jon Stead, scorer of the game-clinching second, was once mocked by Sunderland fans who printed T-shirts reading ‘I saw Jon Stead score a goal’ after it took the striker 30 games to find the back of the net in their colours.

He had the last laugh on Sunday, however, and is now the only player to have scored in all five rounds of this year’s competition.

As Stead made way in the final minute, the joyous Valley Parade crowd rose as one, affording their man of the match a spine-tingling ovation.

In stark contrast, Sunderland’s supporters were fighting among themselves, thus displaying more spirit than their side had shown on the pitch. For Poyet’s side were awful, beaten from the third minute when Billy Clarke’s shot was deflected in off John O’Shea.

At full time, the away fans booed their own players before hissing ‘Gustavo Poyet, it’s always our fault’ in response to the head coach blaming them for recent performances. But that poison could not detract from the passion of the brilliant Bantams. League Cup finalists two seasons ago, their list of Premier League victims also includes Arsenal and Aston Villa.

They are now one match from a third Wembley appearance in two years, and on the evidence of this pulsating performance which married craft and graft on a bog of a pitch, few will fancy a trip to West Yorkshire in the quarter-finals, reticent television companies apart.

Bradford outfought and outthought the Wearsiders to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in 39 years. The pitch, in the end, was a leveller, and at times Bradford did drop to the level of Sunderland.

In a forewarning of Sunderland’s anaemic display, Argentinian playmaker Ricky Alvarez appeared scared of the ball as it dropped inside the first minute, ducking out of a free header.

He wasn’t the only player in blue guilty of freezing during a frenzied start and Bradford’s opening goal came as no surprise.

Filipe Morais delivered a free-kick from the right and, when the visitors failed to clear, Clarke took advantage to blast home off O’Shea at the far post.

Not content with rattling their guests with that goal, brutish and bearded centre back Rory McArdle thundered through the back of Danny Graham when competing for a high ball and the pair only returned to the action some minutes later, bloodied and bandaged.

Further evidence of Sunderland’s lacklustre approach came when Steven Fletcher, refusing to retreat from a free-kick, was booked after his limp leg blocked the attempt to restart.

Bradford were threatening a second and it would have been well deserved had Stead’s header from James Meredith’s centre bounced inside the post rather than creeping wide. But Sunderland should have been level on 18 minutes. 

Seb Larsson’s shot found its way to the unmarked Fletcher, onside just six yards from goal. One touch to steady himself was understandable but the indecision which followed was unforgivable, allowing McArdle to slide and hook clear. Replays suggested the defender had fouled Fletcher, but by putting the ball in the net when he had the chance all debate would have been avoided.

Sunderland finished the half in more positive fashion. Larsson saw a snap volley deflected over the bar by a sliding Gary Liddle, Graham headed into the arms of Ben Williams from Adam Johnson’s lofted centre and the keeper then improvised to keep out a Patrick van Aanholt drive with his knees.

But Johnson’s most telling contribution came at the other end as, from his woeful attempt at a clearance, James Hanson returned a header for Stead to score on 62 minutes. The 31-year-old stepped inside O’Shea before firing under the weak grasp of Vito Mannone

Sunderland failed to fashion a chance of note thereafter and the sight of fans scuffling with each other should worry Poyet, whose position could come under scrutiny this week. As for Bradford, they set off on a lap of honour to the strains of ‘Are you watching BBC?’.
