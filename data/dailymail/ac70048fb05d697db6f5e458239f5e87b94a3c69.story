FIFA has announced that two options have emerged as the most likely dates for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar - and both are in the winter.

A meeting of a task force to look into the international calendar has identified January/February 2022 or November/December 2022 as the most likely options - meaning considerable disruption to the normal football season.

FIFA has been asked to consider May 2022 by the clubs however, despite concerns over the heat during that month.

FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said in a statement on Monday: 'We are getting closer to narrowing the dates for the FIFA World Cup to two options - January/February 2022 or November/December 2022 - but FIFA has also been asked to consider May 2022.

'We will summarise what we've heard today and provide feedback to all parties in order for them to prepare for the next meeting as we progress towards a final decision.'

FIFA added that Qatar 2022 chief executive Hassan Al Thawadi had stated that the 'ideal situation' for the Middle East 'for an all-inclusive World Cup would be for it to be held in the winter' although it was still open to the traditional June/July dates.
