A Romanian television presenter was left nursing a bruised ego after this bizarre stunt went horribly wrong.

It all started when the host attempted to climb a metal ladder that was being held up by two women as he tried to demonstrate how a local singer, dubbed the Beyonce of Romania, became famous.

But, as he ascended the ladder while describing the gypsy singer's rise to fame, he met the opposite fate with a humiliating fall.

A bizarre stunt went horribly wrong on Romanian programme Bad But Good when host tried to climb a ladder

Held up by only his two female assistants, the women struggled under his weight as he ascended

Audience members watched in bemusement as 33-year-old Mihai Morar, the presenter of the programme called Bad But Good, tumbled off the ladder as his assistant, who was struggling to hold it up under his weight, came crashing down with him.

After falling face-first into the hard floor, Morar jumped up and shouted: 'Jesus Christ! What a hit. I got it straight in the head.'

His lovely assistant was knocked onto her back as the ladder fell against her chest.

He quickly fell face-first towards the studio floor, taking his two co-workers down with him

After hitting the floor, the host cried out: 'Jesus Christ! What a hit! I got it straight in the head!'

Thankfully, no one was seriously injured - though the TV host did suffer from a severely bruised ego

Viewer Ion Maniu, 25, from Bucharest, said: 'It was all very strange and much more bad than good.

'I didn't really get what he was trying to show and then he fell off and landed on his face while his assistant was knocked over by the ladder which had hit her hard in the chest.

'Full credit to her, she got up and continued smiling.

'But he didn't seem to pay any attention.'

A spokesperson for Morar said: 'Mihai hit his head and had to be taken to hospital after the show. He is OK now though.'
