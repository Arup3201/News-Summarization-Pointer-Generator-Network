France will look to inject some life into a miserable Six Nations campaign thus far as Philippe Saint-Andre travel to Rome to face Italy on Sunday. 

Les Bleus completed their final preparations at their team base in Marcoussis ahead of their clash with the Azzurri at the Stadio Olimpico. 

Under-fire France boss Saint-Andre has rung the changes following his side's 20-13 loss to Wales in Paris last time out.

Clermont winger Noa Nakaitaci becomes the 82nd player to be used by Saint-Andre; the same number that previous boss Marc Lievremont used during his oft-criticised four-year stint at the helm of the French team. 

Nakaitaci is one of eight changes to the starting line-up with Scott Spedding, Gael Fickou, Maxime Mermoz, Sébastian Tillous-Borde, Loann Goujon, Alexandre Flanquart and Nicolas Mas all earning recalls.
