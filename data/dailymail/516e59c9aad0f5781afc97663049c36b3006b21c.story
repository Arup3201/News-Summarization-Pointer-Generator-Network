The small town of Toomsboro in Georgia, U.S., fell on hard times after its school closed and banks and businesses upped sticks.

But now a developer has taken radical action - nailing up 'for sale' signs up on almost all the buildings in the area.

Would-be buyers can purchase most of the historic properties in the 'rustic' town for a cool $2.5million (£1.6m).

Many of the buildings - including a train depot, bank, old 
grit mill, restaurant and a 500-seat opera house - are more than 100 
years old and have been painstakingly restored.

Its hotel is rumoured to have once sheltered General Sherman, who became famous - or notorious - for his 'modernising' policies during the American Civil War.

Bristling homeowners, however, have 
pointed out that several places in Toomsboro are not on sale, including the 
convenience store, post office and flower shop.

'It's not the entire town,' said Clarice Harrison. 'I live up the hill and it's definitely not for sale.'

The community has a population of just 700, many of whom have lived there for their whole lives and can remember the place when it was lively and bustling.

After the school shut down in the late 
1950s, the main employer left and took the bank and businesses with it, 
leaving the place more isolated.

Mayor Roger Smith said: 'The town of Toomsboro has great potential - but it's a little blink-of-the-eye village at the moment.

David Bumgardner purchased over 50 acres of Toomsboro from preservationist Bill Lucado and through an auction about a decade ago.

His intention was to turn it into a quaint tourist town.

But his plans changed. Now Bumgardner and Lucado are putting the town up for sale again.

Lucado thinks it would be a perfect fit for a movie production company seeking a set or a music company looking for a great venue.

'With just the little rustic community, we could have some antique shops here and draw people in.'

Developer David Bumgardner is open to offers, but with such a hefty price tag, he is 
marketing mainly to film and music studios.

The idea has a precedent. Actress Kim Bassinger bought the town of Braselton, Atlanta, USA in 1989 for $20m (£13m) - reportedly selling it five years later for only $1m.

But Bill Lucado, the previous owner of the Toomsboro properties and broker for the sale, said this is different.

'There are still very few places where you can find this many original buildings in such good condition,' he said.

'Plus, Toomsboro comes with a sense of 
community you simply can't buy - I really do hope something good will 
come of it, I really do.'

The developer is working on creating a website to provide more information on the properties.

Expensive taste: Mr Lucado Jr. and Ms Gadd look over Toomsboro. Will it be bought by a film star, just as actress Kim Basinger bought the town of Braselton, Atlanta, for $20m in 1989?

Everything must go: Coat hangers rust inside the Syrup Mill. The developer is hoping a studio will be able to afford to buy the rustic community as a film set
