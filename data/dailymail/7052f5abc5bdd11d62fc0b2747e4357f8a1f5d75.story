This is the dramatic moment a lorry driver leapt into his blazing truck and steered it away from a busy high street.

Martin Ford risked his life to drive the burning vehicle away from hundreds of Christmas shoppers.

Seconds after he pulled it  into a quiet side street and got out, the whole lorry, including the cab, was engulfed in flames.

Onlookers to the drama on Tuesday afternoon in Maidstone, Kent, hailed the quick-thinking hero as ‘truly selfless’.

Ollie Millen, 20, a labourer, who 
captured Wednesday afternoon’s blaze on video, said: ‘One minute the 
lorry was parked up on the street and the driver looked like he was 
unloading furniture.

‘Then suddenly there was loads of 
smoke and hot red flames, it just seemed to start all at once. I 
couldn’t understand how it happened.’

He added: ‘I thought he was really 
brave to move it, it could have exploded. The fire engines arrived four 
minutes after it was driven out of the street to safety.

Hero: Driver Martin Ford apparently leaped into the blazing truck to steer it away from families but the furniture - worth an estimated £100,000 and seen here in the back of the lorry - was destroyed

‘The driver got out and punched the 
wall, he looked angry at what had happened. The police arrived a little 
after and everyone was asked to stay back while the situation was sorted
out.’

Sophie Griffin, who works at a nearby Jessops store, said: ‘I smelt the smoke and thought it was our shop on fire.

‘I came out and saw the lorry up in 
flames.’ Mr Ford, 36, was in the process of delivering £100,000 worth of
furniture from Burnley-based PD Global when the blaze started.

The married father-of-one has worked 
for the company for ten years and was described by his bosses yesterday 
as their ‘best driver’.

General manager Ashleigh Pell, 60, 
said: ‘Martin realised straight away that the lorry was about to set 
fire to the shop he was delivering to. There were big awnings along the 
side of the shop. If he hadn’t moved it, it would have been a disastrous
outcome.

‘I can certainly understand why people are saying he’s a hero, jumping into a burning wagon isn’t something everyone would do. 

‘We are all extremely proud of him.’

Fire crews then came to assist, dousing the flames and ensuring less tragedy

Fireifghters closed off the streets where, just moments before, hundreds of shoppers had been Christmas shopping
