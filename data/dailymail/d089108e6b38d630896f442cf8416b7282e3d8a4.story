This is definitely not the beach you want to throw your towel down onâ€¦as it's covered with hundreds of thousands of migrating Hermit crabs.

Every year on the tiny isle of St John in the U.S. Virgin Islands a bizarre phenomenon occurs when hundreds of thousands of Hermit crabs, also known as Soldier crabs, make the treacherous journey towards the sea.They all travel en-mass at the same time to reach the water where they breed. The female crabs then cast their fertilised eggs into the Caribbean before retreating back into the vegetation.

The newly born Hermit crabs spend several months in the sea before returning to the land.Hermit crabs are predominantly a land creature, often burrowing into the roots of large trees, but must stay relatively close to the sea as they require a supply of water in their shells. The sea is also a perfect breeding ground for the crabs, who release millions of offspring into the waters.

Photographer and cinematographer Steve Simonsen, 53, from Michigan in the U.S., captured the spectacle with his camera at Nanny Point in the south east of the island after a tip-off from a friend.

He said: 'I received an urgent telephone call from my good friend Pam Gaffin.

'She was terribly excited about an event that was happening before her eyes. She told me it was a migration of soldier crabs also called hermit crabs and there were millions and millions of them, she likened it to the migrations of Serengeti.''I didn't need to hear anymore, I loaded my car with cameras and was out the door.' he said.

Incredibly, the entire crab migration takes just one day, with the crabs heading down to the seafront at sunrise, laying their eggs before retreating back up inland into the hills at noon.

'When I first arrived at the beach, the sight of that many crabs was astonishing,' Mr Simonsen said.

'It was hard to fathom and once I set up a camera for a wide shot, I had to try to settle myself down and be sure that I would get all the shots that I needed.''Picking my way through the mass of crabs was difficult and time consuming. I would pick a spot on the beach rocks, close to the action that I wanted to film and I would crouch, kneel or lay down in order to get the shots.

'During that time, crabs would crawl over my feet, hands, arms and legs and none of them were interested in pinching.'The photographer plans to study the crabs' incredible migratory patterns next year when the phenomenon takes place again in August.
