From Lady Gaga to delicate rose bushes, it seems there's little that artist May Sum can't turn into a sculpture.

But these are not your average sculpture. Instead of stone or bronze, Sum creates her incredibly intricate pieces using lipstick.

Unfortunately for those who fancy owning a lipstick sculpture of their own, would-be buyers will need deep pockets, as each piece costs an eye-watering £529.

Clever: Hong Kong artist May Sum turns ordinary lipsticks into mini sculptures and sells them for £529

Nevertheless, the Hong Kong artist says that her pieces can be used for their original purpose, although they might not look the same afterwards.

'They can be used since all the lipsticks are new,' Sum explained in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

'I like to use MAC and Nars because their texture is harder and they always have special colours,' she continues. 'Chanel is also great, as they  have a  beautiful red colour series.'

The lipsticks, which have now gone on sale at luxury launches website, VeryFirstTo.com, are available in a choice of themes and can also be customised with portraits of the customer's choice.

Sum, who began her career as a make-up artist, takes between 12 and 13 hours to create a floral sculpture but says the more detailed portraits can take up to a week.

'As a senior make up artist, I understand cosmetics very well,' adds Sum. 'But understanding  cosmetics doesn't mean being limited.

'I reinterpreted the meaning of lipstick. Each sculpture makes lipstick become an art work. Each lipstick is a brand-new story.'

For those wondering what sort of person wants lipstick-turned-art in their lives, Sum has some answers.

'Most of the people who order the lipsticks do so as a 
special gift to special person,' she reveals.

No limit: According to Sum, clients can choose to have their own or another portrait sculpted onto their lipstick

'I have quite a lot of male clients who 
order it for their wives, which is so sweet. Of course some of my clients 
order them for themselves, as they want their own face on the lipstick.'

While for now Sum says she's concentrating on lipstick art, she says she won't rule out working with different types of cosmetic in future.

'i have done it before,' she explains earnestly. 'I once used stick foundation to create my art and I'd like to try powder foundation and eye shadow.' She pauses for a second and adds: 'Blusher too!'

May says keep the lipstick around 17-25¿. Do not put it into the refrigerator as it will crack

May's art is sculpted in about 10-12 hours. For more complicated ones, it could take a week or longer
