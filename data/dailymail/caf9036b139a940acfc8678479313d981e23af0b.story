Major League Baseball is expected to seek suspensions in the coming weeks against 20 players, among them Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, for their connection to a Miami area clinic at the center of the doping scandal.

Tony Bosch, the founder of the now-closed Biogenesis of America, agreed to cooperate with MLB's investigation, sources told ESPN's Outside the Line, giving the league the green light to move ahead with the suspensions.

If the suspensions are upheld, the MLB doping scandal would be the largest in American sports history, comparable only to the 1919 'Black Sox fiasco,' in which eight players from the Chicago White Sox were banned from baseball for life for intentionally losing games to allow the Cincinnati  Reds to win the World Series.

Notorious: The now-closed Biogenesis of America clinic in Miami is a the center of MLB's massive performance-enhancing drug scandal

The commissioner's office might seek as many as 100-game suspensions against Rodriguez, the Boston Brewers' Ryan Braun and others for their suspected connection to the clinic and their denial of the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

MLB officials reportedly have clinic records listing the names of about 20 players that Bosch could confirm when he meets with them next week.

Ryan Braun                           Brewers

Everth Cabrera                      Padres

Melky Cabrera                       Blue Jays

Francisco Cervelli                  Yankees

Bartolo Colon                         Athletics

Nelson Cruz                           Rangers

Fautino de los Santos           Free agent

Gio Gonzalez                         Nationals

Yasmani Grandal                   Padres

Fernando Martinez                Astros

Jesus Montero                       Mariners

Jordan Norberto                     Free agent

Jhonny Peralta                       Tigers

Cesar Puello                          Mets

Alex Rodriguez                       Yankees

In a recent interview with ESPN, Bosch pleaded ignorance regarding PEDs and claimed that  media accounts accusing him of distributing illegal substances among players amounted to 'character assassination.'

'I have been accused, tried and convicted in the media. And so I think [I] have been falsely accused throughout the media,' he told ESPN's Pedro Gomez. 'I've done nothing wrong.'

According to Outside the Line, Bosch's claims that he had nothing to do with PEDs are at odds with accounts from numerous sourced who said he helped provide banned substances to possible dozens of athletes.

In exchange for Bosch's cooperation, MLB has agreed to drop the lawsuit it filed against him in March.

However, Bosch also could be facing a criminal investigation. He recently received a cease-and-desist letter from the Florida State Department of Health, which referred the case to law enforcement.

Bosch's name first surfaced in 2009 after then-Los Angeles Dodgers player Manny Ramirez tested positive for testosterone. MLB officials reviewed Ramirez's medical file and discovered a prescription for human chorionic gonadotropin, which was written out by Bosch's father, Dr Pedro Bosch.

Ramirez was suspended for 50 games and was sidelined a second time for 100 games in 2011 after he failed another doping test.

Bosch appeared on MLB’s radar a second time last summer in connection to Melky Cabrera, Bartolo Colon and Yasmani Grandal, who also tested positive for testosterone and received 50-game suspensions during the 2012 season, the Chicago Tribune reported.

ESPN also reported that MLB is working to determine whether Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano was also linked to Bosch and his clinic. A spokesperson for the player's foundation is listed in clinic records.

In April, it was revealed that Rodriguez reportedly tried to purchase documents from the Miami clinic in order to keep them from MLB officials.

Rodriguez allegedly had an intermediary purchase the papers from the Biogenesis clinic in Miami.

After officials in the MLB front office learned of this deal, they rushed to buy copies of the documents as well, which purport to show ties to performance-enhancing drugs.

Rodriguez's purchase was first reported by the New York Times.

The New Times said it obtained records detailing purchases by Rodriguez, 2012 All-Star game MVP Melky Cabrera, 2005 AL Cy Young Award winner Bartolo Colon and 2011 AL championship series MVP Nelson Cruz.

Its exposé claimed the baseball star received cocktails including Human Growth Hormones (HGH) and testosterone creams on a fairly regular basis, according to handwritten notes viewed by someone familiar with the clinic.

Rodriguez's name appears in handwritten notes, reportedly kept by Bosch's clinic, that indicate he received various substances from 2009 up until 2012.

'There was his name, over and over again, logged as either 'Alex Rodriguez', 'Alex Rod', or his nickname at the clinic, 'Cacique,' a pre-Columbian Caribbean chief. Rodriguez’s name appears 16 times throughout,' according to the article.

Rodriguez has denied the claims.

'I have nothing to hide': Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers is also being investigated for his links to the Florida clinic which is now closed. He has said his name appears in records because of a payment dispute

Other baseball players the newspaper said appeared in the records include Gio Gonzalez and Yasmani Grandal.

Later, Yahoo Sports reported that 2011 NL MVP Ryan Braun's name also appeared in the records.

Braun subsequently issued a statement
saying: 'I have nothing to hide.' He has said his name appeared because
of an issue over payment for consultancy work relating to his 
successful fight to overturn a 2011 doping ban.

Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig has declined to comment on Biogenesis, other than to say it is the subject of a 'very thorough investigation' by MLB.

Lawsuit: Anthony Bosch faces a claim for unspecified damages after he was accused of doling out banned substances at his Miami clinic

The Times said the payments by the commissioner's office did not exceed more than 'several thousand dollars.'

MLB officials decided to take the unusual step of paying for the documents because, with no subpoena power, its investigators would likely have no access to the material if it wound up in the players' hands, the paper reported.

Last month, Major League Baseball sued Biogenesis, and its operators, accusing them of scheming to provide banned performance-enhancing drugs to players in violation of their contracts.

The lawsuit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court seeks unspecified damages from Biogenesis and its operator, Anthony Bosch.

Several other Bosch associates are named in the lawsuit.

Among the banned drugs supplied, the lawsuit said, are testosterone, human growth hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin.

Baseball officials also unsuccessfully lobbied New Times editors to share the documents that formed the basis of their story.
