Amputee veterans visited Boston Marathon bombing survivors on Monday to offer hope, comfort and share their experiences of having similar injuries.

Marines who had lost limbs fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan went to Boston Medical Center to raise the spirits of those patients recovering from the terrorist attack.

Among the patients were Celeste Corcoran and her daughter Sydney, 18, both seriously injured while standing close to the finish line when the first bomb exploded  on April 15.

Celeste lost both her legs below the knee while her 18-year-old daughter suffered serious shrapnel wounds.

The veterans are members of the Semper Fi Fund, a veteran non-profit organization. One veteran hugged the women and told them: 'This doesn't matter. This is just a change of scenery.'

Celeste wiped tears from her eyes as she said: 'I can't do anything right now.'

Marine Sgt Gabe Ramirez, who lost one leg below the knee and the other above, responded: 'Now yes, but I'm telling you with all my heart that you are going to be more independent than you already were.'

He added: 'This is a new beginning for the both of you. There's so many opportunities that is going to come your way and so much support.'

The mother and daughter had been at the race to support Celeste's sister who was running the marathon for the first time.

On Tuesday, Sydney celebrated her 18th birthday in hospital where she was surrounded by family and friends. Jeff Bauman, another victim of the Boston bombing who lost both his legs, visited to bring a gift.

Doctors reported on Tuesday that every 
one of the more than 180 people injured in the Boston Marathon blasts 
who made it to a hospital alive now seem likely to survive.

'All I feel is joy,' said Dr. George Velmahos, chief of trauma surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, referring to his hospital's 31 blast patients. 'Whoever came in alive, stayed alive.'

Three people did die in the blasts, but at the scene, before hospitals even had a chance to try to save them.

More than 1,600 U.S. troops from the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have lost a limb while many others have 
lost fingers or toes, according to an AP study in 2012.
