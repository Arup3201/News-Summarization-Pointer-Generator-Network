The body of an ex-Royal Marine who was the first Briton to be killed while fighting against ISIS has been returned to his family in a special ceremony attended by hundreds of Syrian Kurds.

Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting alongside Kurdish forces in the frontline village of Tel Khuzela in Syria.

His coffin, which was draped in both the Kurdish flag and the Union Jack, was handed over to his father and uncle in a special ceremony on the Syria-Iraq border yesterday.

Soldiers turned out to form a guard of honour during the procession, while hundreds of Syrian Kurds lined the streets and waved brightly-coloured flags.

The former Royal Marine, described as a 'one-man army' who was 'very angry about the Middle East', was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli.

He is believed to have flown to the region after becoming horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS and his fellow fighters said he was the first to volunteer for ambushes and assaults.

Prior to his death, he recorded video footage of himself – dressed in army fatigues – in which he said: 'My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.' 

His family, who live in a detached former farmhouse in Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were devastated to hear of his death. 

They were under the impression that he had left Britain in November last year to provide 'medical and humanitarian support' as an expert in battlefield medicine.

Shortly after his death, Mr Scurfield's father Chris and uncle travelled out to Syria to try and repatriate his body.

Mr Scurfield described yesterday's ceremony as 'overwhelming' and said it was 'very special and very comforting' to his family. 

His son's coffin was draped with the Kurdish and Union Flags and hundreds of people, including Kurdish fighters in the region, watched as it was loaded onto an ambulance to be taken to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.

Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine.

He had been training with the U.S. Marines in California when he made email contact with a Kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline.

But he was stopped while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, a now well-known jumping off point for Syria, in October and questioned by the American authorities.

His one-way ticket rang ‘alarm bells’, officials said, and his luggage, phone and laptop were examined.

The Marine, who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of ISIS, was also questioned by police on arrival in the UK and then returned to his unit, 45 Commando, in Arbroath, Scotland.

It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later. 

At one point during the procession, a woman dressed in a headscarf offered Mr Scurfield's devastated father support, by pulling him close to her and kissing him on the head.

According to the Kurdish Female Fighters page on Facebook, those who gathered at the ceremony chanted ‘slogans of heroism’ as Mr Scurfield’s body was handed back to his family.

The group said the chants included: ‘Oh immortal martyr! We swear by your blood, your blood will never be left on the ground, we will take your revenge and we will never forget you. 

'With our life and with our blood we are with you, oh martyr.’

Another post by the Facebook group said: ‘The body of British YPG fighter Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, is on the way back to UK.

‘You will never be forgotten, you will always live in our hearts.

‘RIP Hero.’

It is believed that it will be some time before the fighter's body is repatriated to the UK, due to paperwork, and the Foreign Office refused to comment on the matter.

Mr Scurfield, who was known as Kosta to his comrades, is the first Briton to be killed while fighting ISIS - also known as Islamic State - in Syria. 

The former drama student had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines, aged 21. 

However, he fled to Syria to fight alongside the Kurdish forces after becoming 'horrified by the atrocities being carried out by ISIS'.

Mr Scurfield is said to have fled to Syria last November to fight alongside the Kurds against ISIS after becoming 'horrified by the atrocities being carried out' by the terror outfit. He died in mortar fire on March 2

His family, including archaeologist parents Chris and Vicci and his student sister Georgianna, said they were heartbroken but proud of him.

In a statement following his death they said: 'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.' 

While high numbers of foreigners are known to have joined ISIS, around 100 Westerners - including several Britons - are thought to have travelled to fight alongside the Kurds. 

Last month, a 19-year-old serving British soldier was returned to his unit after joining the Kurdish peshmerga.
