Protected: David Cameron's Queen's speech on Wednesday will include a 'Bill of Rights for consumers'

Shoppers will get money back from rogue websites, replacements for faulty items and poor quality home repairs redone, under new laws to protect the consumer.

Ministers say too many people are unaware of their rights when buying goods and services online from downloading music and films to switching energy suppliers.

A crackdown on rogue suppliers who provide substandard or damaged goods, or impose unfair terms and conditions will be announced in next week’s Queen’s Speech.

Government sources say the measure 
will help businesses who play by the rules, and is part of a Queen’s 
Speech agenda of ‘helping those who do the right thing.’

The Tories are determined to win back 
voters’ trust following a storming performance by the UK Independence 
Party in last week’s county council elections in which they won 147 
sears.

David Cameron will attempt to to 
settle his party’s nerves in the Queen’s speech on Wednesday with a 
focus on the economy and immigration.

He has ditched nanny-state measures 
such as minimum alcohol pricing, plain cigarette packets and a so-called
‘snooper’s charter’ to monitor people’s internet usage, while the 
pledge to enshrine foreign aid spending in law has been kicked into the 
long grass.

Instead the government will offer a 
‘pro-business, pro-growth agenda’ with bills to cut red tape, reduce the
National Insurance burden on small firms and boost investment in 
infrastructure.

It will also include populist measures
to restrict access to the NHS for new migrants, and make it easier to 
deport foreign criminals, seen as grievances fuelling the UKIP vote.

The measures to protect consumers will
condense 60 pieces of legislation into one beefed-up law covering 
goods, services, digital content and unfair contract terms.

Dubbed a ‘Bill of Rights’ for 
consumers, business minister Jo Swinson said the law in this area has 
become ‘too confusing with many people not sure where to turn if they 
have a problem’.

The Government say Britain’s shopping 
habits have been transformed by new technology over the past decade, but
the law has not kept pace, leaving people at the mercy of rogue firms.

Promises: David Cameron's new consumer law will condense 60 pieces of legislation into one beefed-up law covering goods, services, digital content and unfair contract terms

For digital content, such as films, music and games downloaded over the internet, providers must provide give a replacement or money back if the service does not work.

When faulty goods such as laptops or microwaves break down, retailers will have to provide a refund after one failed repair or replacement within a stated time limit, and suppliers can no longer hide behind ‘unfair’ terms and conditions.

Even verbal agreements made with builders are covered so if works are not carried out to the agreed standard they will have to be re-done or the customer given money off.

Miss Swinson said: ‘Stronger consumer protection and clearer consumer rights will help create a fairer and stronger marketplace. We are hoping to bring in a number of changes to improve consumer confidence and make sure the law is fit for the 21st century.’

The Department for Business say the 
reforms law will save the economy around £4 billion over 10 years as 
complaints will be resolved faster if people are aware if their rights,

Citizens Advice said that consumer complaints in the past year about goods and holidays totalled £185 million.

Sixteen million people experienced a problem with digital content such as film or music downloads or software in 2011.

Under the new law, trading Standards 
will get more enforcement powers to take firms to court for compensation
if consumers’ rights are breached.

Richard Lloyd, Which? executive 
director, welcomed the move saying it would ‘make it easier for people 
to understand their rights and give consumers power to challenge bad 
practice.’

He said: ‘It 
should also mean that both consumers and regulators have the tools they 
need to challenge unscrupulous businesses that breach the law’.

This
includes collective redress, when groups of consumers band together to 
make a joint claim against a firm to boost their chances of success and 
avoid crippling legal fees.

It
is used against ‘anti-competitive’ behaviour such as airlines fixing 
their fuel surcharge too high, petrol pumps wrongly calibrated so they 
overcharge, or small businesses held to ransom by price-fixing 
suppliers.

Mr Lloyd said the
Government should go even further even these lines to allow third 
parties like Which? to take against rogue companies ‘and force them to 
put things right for consumers.’

Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice said the ‘staggering’ numbers of complaints they receive shows the need for a change in the law, but questioned whether it would be enough - and said rogue firms should be named and shamed.

She said: ‘Consumers are often refused their legal rights when something they buy is faulty or sub-standard.

‘When businesses are taken to task for failing consumers the punishment should include compensating consumers and any retailer or provider who doesn’t abide by the rules should be named and shamed by regulators.

‘I’d like to see a ‘Santa List’ which identifies naughty and nice businesses. Publicly listing those businesses who do not comply with regulations will not only warn consumers but reward retailers who do the right thing by their customers.’
