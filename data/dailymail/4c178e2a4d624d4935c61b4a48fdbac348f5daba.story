Pregnant Caley Thomas just presumed she had a stomach ache while giving her eldest daughter Madison a bath one night.

So the Welsh 25-year-old from Greenmeadow, Cwmbran, was shocked to find herself in labour four days earlier than expected...and having to deliver the baby by herself on her bathroom floor.

Baby Bobby: Caley Thomas, 25, with Bobby, the newest addition to her family, to whom she gave birth on the bathroom floor of her home in Cwmban, Wales.

Miss Thomas - whose partner Steven Board, 27, was working late that night of 22 September - was bathing Madison, two, when she felt stomach pains.

But within just 30 minutes she learned that it was not quite as simple as an upset stomach and had delivered her second child, Bobby, weighing 8lbs 6oz, alone, while a shocked Madison sat in the bath.

The new mother-of-two said: 'I spent all day cleaning, and scrubbed the bathroom from top to bottom. Then when I was bathing Madison, Steve rang and I joked I might be having contractions because I had an upset stomach.

'Next thing I knew, my waters had broken, and by the time I rang Steve at 7.23pm, the baby had been born.'

Happy family: Caley Thomas and Steve Board with their children Madison, two, and baby Bobby, one week.

Miss Thomas said she had expected the birth of her son to be as painful as that of her daughter, but said there was no pain at all, just a stomach ache.

She added: 'Steve,
the paramedics and the midwife all arrived at the same time a couple of
minutes later, and they cut the cord, checked us all over and said we 
didn't even need to go to hospital. They couldn't believe it had 
happened so quickly.

'Poor Madison had been in the bath the whole 
time, and that kept me calm as I didn't want to upset her. She kept 
saying, "I'll make you better, Mummy! I'll make you better!".

'And then when he was born, she said, "Thanks for my brother, Mummy. Thanks for the baby!".'

Big sister: Madison Board, two, with her new baby brother, Bobby, who was born on the bathroom floor while she was having a bath.

Father-of-two Mr Board said: 'I was working late. Whenever I'm working a later shift I always ring Madison to say goodnight. When I rang at 6.55pm, Caley was bathing Madison and said she had a bad stomach. She made a joke about it being contractions.

'Then at 7.08pm she texted me and said I should come home. So I left work straight away and headed for home. Then she rang and said her waters had broken. By the time I got halfway home she rang again and said he had arrived.'

Miss Thomas added: 'We'd like to thank the two paramedics and Cath, the duty midwife, who all arrived really quickly. They were great!'

'I'll look after you, Mummy!' Madison, two, tried to keep her mother Caley calm as she gave birth to baby Bobby in the bathroom.

Speedy birth: It took Caley Thomas, 25, just 30 minutes to give birth to baby Bobby, who weighed 8lbs 6oz.

All together: Dad Steve Board and mum Caley Thomas with their two children, Madison and Bobby.
