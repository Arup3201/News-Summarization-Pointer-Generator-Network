Their bags are adored by women but it seems British heritage brand Mulberry has designs on the wardrobes of the nation's men too.

The brand has announced that it is to launch an capsule collection to be sold exclusively on luxury men's fashion site, Mr Porter.

Included in the collection, which focuses on accessories, are sturdy leather-trimmed canvas holdalls, in cornflower blue, black and dove grey, and chic messenger bags.

And the collaboration appears to be going down well with Mulberry's A-list fans with Romeo and Juliet actor Douglas Booth, Isaac Ferry and Charles Finch all turning out for a celebratory supper with the label's brand director Anne-Marie Verdin and Mr Porter's Jeremy Langmead.

Guests at London's Café Royal dined on Scottish lobster, veal with bubble and squeak and an apple and chocolate pudding, before being given an exclusive sneak peek of the collection.

The new collaboration is the latest in a series of coups for the heritage brand, which was founded in 1971 by Roger Saul.

Despite the departure of the label's enormously successful former creative director Emma Hill, the brand is powering ahead and is proving particularly popular with shoppers from the Far East.

Practical: The new collection contains updated versions of classic styles such as the messenger bag

The brand also secured model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne for its autumn/winter campaign which was shot on location at a crumbling Oxfordshire manor.

And Delevingne isn't the only big name to appear in Mulberry's typically quirky take on garb beloved of the English eccentric.

Other celebrity fans include Alexa Chung and discerning American Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, as well as Pixie Lott and British Vogue's Alexandra Schulman.
