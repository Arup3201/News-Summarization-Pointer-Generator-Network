A few weeks is nothing in the context of the ancient existence of the Amazon's Awa-Guaja people, but in his short time one photographer managed to capture the everyday life of a tribe considered the most endangered in the world.

Daniel Rodrigues created a breathtaking collection of images depicting the beauty and brutality of their troubled existence.

The Awa-Guaja tribes are critically under threat from loggers and grazing farmers keen to decimate their pocket of the vast Brazilian rainforest and through desperation have only in recent decades come out of their centuries of avoiding contact with westerners - some remain uncontacted by white people.

Photographer Daniel Rodrigues got remarkable access to the daily life of the tribe, and was forced to communicate via hand gestures

The French-born photographer, based in Portugal, travels the world to snap incredible black and white and colour images, documenting them on his site DanielRodriguesPhoto.com, but had never come across a tribe so untouched by modern life before.

While their nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle requires a level of bravery and enterprise many westerners will never comprehend, Portugal-based Rodrigues found a friendly and welcoming people despite needing to rely on hand gestures for communication. 

The tribe, which numbers around 350 people, first adopted a nomadic lifestyle to avoid confrontations with invading Europeans and have successfully lived in the Amazon ever since.

His journey to the eastern Amazon in the wet season last year saw Rodrigues join hunting missions in dense foliage for periods that would equate to a day and half of office work for a westerner.

The tribes people hunted indigenous red puma, Capuchin monkey and other land animals, and fished their plentiful rivers for fish and poraque (electric eels) for their fully self-sustained existence that they are in serious danger of losing without help in their battle against loggers.

In some rare good news for the tribes, Survival International reported in April last year that  the Awá and their supporters celebrated the Brazilian government's move to send in troops to remove illegal loggers from Awá land.

The military intervention in the states of Para and Maranhao is just the beginning though with the Amazon such an incredibly vast area that is tough to defend.

The greatest threat to the ancient tribes of the Awa-Guaja is loggers, who have resorted to violence in their bid to decimate the forest

Daniel's work with the Awa-Guaja was rewarded with an honourable mention in last year's Moscow International Photo Awards, in which he also came second for his photo essay 'Rapa das Bestas' about horse wrestlers in Spain.

In 2013, he won the World Press Photo Daily Life category with a image of footballers in Guinea Bissau.
