A teenage drug dealer who sold a batch of ecstasy that killed a 15-year-old schoolgirl has been spared prison after a judge despaired at ‘the folly of youth’.

Alex Williams, 17, sold an ‘exceptionally’ pure version of the drug to a friend of GCSE pupil Martha Fernback. Martha died within hours of taking it.

Williams pleaded guilty to supplying ecstasy, but instead of the ten-year jail term he might have received, he was given a three-month curfew and an 18-month youth rehabilitation order.

Tragedy: Martha Fernback collapsed and died shortly after taking the 'exceptionally' pure MDMA, sold to her by her friend Williams

A judge heard that Williams, an NVQ 
student with a previous police warning for cannabis possession, was 
‘consumed by overwhelming guilt’.

Martha’s
 friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, bought a gram of MDMA, 
also known as ecstasy, for £40 on July 17 last year. Martha and her 
friend split it between them. Williams made a £20 profit.

The substance was deadly because it had a purity level of 91 per cent, compared with the average street level of 58.

Oxford Crown Court heard that when he sold the drug, Williams, said: ‘This is new stuff so I’m not sure what it will be like.’

Despair: Sentencing, Judge Mary Jane Mowat expressed her 'incredulity at the folly of youth' who are prepared to take street drugs without knowing the dangers

Martha,
 a middle-class Oxford schoolgirl, took her fatal dose three days later.
 After his arrest, police pleaded with Williams to tell them who, if 
anyone else, he had sold it to so as to prevent more fatalities but he 
refused to comment.

Martha’s
 mother, Anne-Marie Cockburn, said she could not remain angry with 
Williams for the rest of her life and hoped to work with him to try to 
change people’s minds about legalising and regulating drugs.

Miss
 Cockburn, who had raised Martha as a single parent since she was a 
baby, said she does not believe ‘the war on drugs’ in the UK is working 
and that a more realistic approach is needed.

Sentencing
 Williams on Monday, Judge Mary Jane Mowat said: ‘There is no escaping 
the fact that, in part because of your actions, a 15-year-old girl lost 
her life.

‘I have read a 
[victim impact] statement from her mother and as the mother of an only 
child myself in Oxford, every part of me resonates with the despair she 
describes – and her incredulity at the folly of youth, and of those 
willing to indulge in street drugs not knowing what is in them, where 
they came from or what the potential dangers could be.

‘They always know better. Well, maybe this case will go some way towards persuading some children that they don’t.’

Yesterday
 anti-drugs campaigner Mary Brett reacted with dismay at the sentence. 
‘A sentence like that is no deterrent whatsoever, This  is dreadful.

‘The
 policing of drugs is much too soft. It is ludicrous. You need to send a
 signal that it is not acceptable to deal drugs – a short, sharp shock 
is what is needed. In this case, a few weeks at least in prison would 
have been warranted.’

Peter
 Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention victims’ 
charity, added: ‘The lenience of this sentence is out of all proportion 
to the deadly consequences of the crime committed. It is concerning when
 claims of guilt are taken at face value and traded in for soft 
sentences.’

The court heard 
that three days after she got the ecstasy Martha, from North Oxford, 
took her share of the drug and went to a park in the city with friends.

Tributes: Mourners lay floral tributes at the scene in Hinksey Park, Oxford, where Martha died

Prosecutor
 David Povall said Martha had used it before. ‘Martha was saying the 
drugs were amazing, “It feels like a dream, it’s better than the last 
time that we did it.”’

Her 
friends then noticed that Martha was sweating a lot. She said she was 
going for a swim in a pond to cool down. ‘At that point, Martha 
collapsed,’ said Mr Povall. ‘Her legs went from underneath her.’

Shortly after arriving at hospital Martha died after suffering a cardiac arrest.

Alistair
 Grainger, defending Williams, said: ‘There’s not a day goes by when he 
isn’t thinking about what has happened and is consumed by the 
overwhelming guilt which flows from the consequences of his actions.’

Williams,
 who claims on Facebook to be a McDonald’s manager, lives with his 
mother Alison, 47, and brother Leon, 20, in a £200,000 semi-detached 
house in the Botley area of Oxford.

Reaching out: Martha's mother Anne-Marie Cockburn, said she would meet Williams and work with him to try to change people's minds about legalising and regulating some drugs

In
 addition to the curfew and rehabilitation order, he was ordered to 
undergo drug treatment and to work for charity. Williams, dressed in 
low-slung tracksuit trousers, declined to comment last night.

Martha’s mother, a 42-year-old marketing consultant, called for a different approach to drugs.

‘Martha
 was a middle-class girl in a north Oxford school and look what 
happened,’ she added. ‘That shows what the current drug education and 
legislation lead to. There has got to be another way, because the 
current way is not working.’

Miss
 Cockburn has written a book describing in raw, painful detail the 
moment she watched her only child die and chronicling her grief since.
