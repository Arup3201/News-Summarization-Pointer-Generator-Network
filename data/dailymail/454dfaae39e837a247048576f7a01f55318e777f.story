Outrageous: James Tracy claims that the government was behind the Boston Marathon bomber that left 3 dead and more than 180 injured

Outrageous claims made by a professor who specializes in conspiracy theories are set to provoke grieving families by saying that the Sandy Hook massacre may not have happened at all.

James Tracy, a tenured history professor at Florida Atlantic University, wrote a lengthy post on his personal blog saying that the shooting that left 20 children and six teachers dead may not have happened the way that it is widely believed, if it happened at all.

Backed solely by the erroneous early reports filed during the midst of the horrendous incident, Mr Tracy 's claim is preying on the confusion of the tragic day.

'While it sounds like an outrageous claim, one is left to inquire whether the Sandy Hook shooting ever took place -- at least in the way law enforcement authorities and the nation's news media have described,' he has said.

The 47-year-old professor bases his 
outrageous claims largely on the flurry of conflicting media reports 
that were made as news of the shooting was released throughout the day 
on December 14.

As 
with many conspiracy theorists who find darker linings in even the most 
horrific tragedies, this is far from his first foray into the world of 
the unproven.

Mr Tracy has written a number of book chapters about media coverage of wars, economic overhauls and union negotiations.

On
 his blog, however, he has hit a number of the classic conspiracy 
theories: the September 11 attacks, the purview of the Department of 
Homeland Security, the PATRIOT Act, the death of Osama bin Laden and 
Fukishima have all been topics of interest.

Shut down: Sandy Hook Elementary School is now closed, seen here on January 3, but a professor in Florida argues that the shooting that took place in the school may not have happened as is conventionally believed

Tragic: One of the points of professor James Tracy's argument is the fact that there have been no photos of the bodies of the 20 child victims or the six teachers

In his latest shocking claim, he focuses much of his attention on the fact that early reports claimed that police were either searching for or had two suspects in custody.

The story then progressed that Ryan Lanza was the lone gunman, based reportedly on the identification that the shooter had on him at the time of the attack.

Ryan, 24, was then found at his home in Hoboken, New Jersey - two states away from his 20-year-old brother Adam, the shooter.

Even though he is paid to teach a class called Culture of Conspiracy which will undoubtedly produce outrageous ideas, Florida Atlantic University appears to feel that the questioning of the murder of first graders was a bridge too far.

'James Tracy does not speak for the 
university. The website on which his post appeared is not affiliated 
with FAU in any way,' school spokesman Lisa Metcalf said to the Sun Sentinel.

Though his ultimate end goal is unclear, he says that the end goal of the 'supposed' shooting was political in nature.

The moment he heard: Mr Tracy believes that there were government forces at work in the shooting at Sandy Hook, and theoretically then this may not be the moment President Obama was told

Predictably, his statements have 
sparked outrage from people across the country and not just in the 
still-grieving Connecticut town where much of the last three weeks has 
been spent picking up the pieces.

'Is there something in the water in 
Florida that makes for idiocy,' commented Ray Gillies on the story by 
the local ABC affiliateÂ WPBF.

'How dare you suggest this was a hoax
 and entertain that this didn't happen,' said a Sun Sentinel reader with
 the username JimNasium1.

'I'm afraid that you do not seem to be
 worthy of the teaching credentials that you hold and were any of my 
kids students of yours, I'd withdraw them from your roster within the 
hour.You are NOT good at what you do and you suck as a human being.'

Political ends: He argues that the shooting was enabled in order to speed up legislation against guns

Instead, he is speaking plenty for himself and other believers by posting repeatedly on his blog, memoryholeblog.com, and appearing on talk radio shows to promote the theory.

'As documents relating to the Sandy Hook shooting continue to be assessed and interpreted by independent researchers, there is a growing awareness that the media coverage of the massacre of 26 children and adults was intended primarily for public consumption to further larger political ends,' he wrote.

He argues that Senator Dianne Feinstein was already in the midst of trying to rework the assault weapons ban that she co-sponsored back in the 1990s, and that the shooting gave her leverage to move it through the legislative process quicker.

It is unclear if Mr Tracy has any vested interest in the gun control debate or if he himself owns any guns. Calls to Mr Tracy were not immediately returned.
