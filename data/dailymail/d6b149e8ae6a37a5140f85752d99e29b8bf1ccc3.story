Danuta Cross, 64, from South Cave, East Yorkshire (pictured outside court), has been warned she faces jail if she continues to harass her neighbours

With their neatly trimmed hedges and well-kept gardens, on the surface these adjoining bungalows in a Yorkshire village are tranquil havens for a peaceful retirement.

But for five years a bitter feud has raged between retired teaching assistant Danuta Cross, 64, and the former civil servants next door whom she accused of being jealous of her award-winning garden.

Cross made the lives of David Myhill, 59, and Alexandra Smith, 65, a misery by making disturbing threats against them, a court heard. It took a criminal conviction and the threat of jail to stop the harassment and bring an uneasy truce to this bizarre dispute.

Magistrates heard that Cross, a once ‘respected member of the community’ in South Cave, East Yorkshire, claimed she was being ‘stalked’ and ‘watched all the time’ by the couple because they envied her gardening skills. Police investigated and found no evidence to back up her allegations.

Instead, they took action against Cross for tormenting her neighbours after she threatened to ‘hang’ Mr Myhill from his tree last summer, Beverley Magistrates’ Court heard.

Cross, who had previously won the village gardening competition, was prosecuted after Mr Myhill and Miss Smith logged 11 threats of violence in just one month.

She admitted harassment over a six-month period, and was ordered to pay a fine of £900 plus £130 costs and victim surcharge at a court hearing on October 29.

Cross also had a restraining order imposed on her to prevent future harassment. Passing sentence, District Judge Frederick Rutherford told her: ‘It’s a sad situation indeed that a woman your age is before the court. If you continue to offend you will place yourself in prison.’

Prosecutor Andrew Vaughan told the court the harassment included ‘abuse and threatening language’ aimed at the couple, whom Cross branded ‘poisoned dwarves’.

She allegedly told Mr Myhill: ‘I’ll let you hang from that f****** tree and leave you to f****** dangle.’ She then added: ‘I know you’re watching me, I can see you when I’m in my underwear.’

Cross continued the abusive rants across the hedge dividing the two gardens, despite receiving a conditional discharge for similar offences in December last year.

Her solicitor, Michael Copeman, said: ‘She perceived herself to be the victim and still does, although she accepts that her actions have been absolutely appalling.’

After the hearing, Mr Myhill said: ‘Danuta Cross has been harassing us for over five years. Threats have included hanging us in the tree and having a good laugh, maiming us with an iron rod and spraying our eyes to blind us.

‘She has alleged I’m a paedophile, a spy and that I leer into her house watching her in her underwear.’ Speaking yesterday, he said: ‘There have been no further incidents since the court case. We just hope that the police action has brought matters to an end.’

Miss Smith added: ‘Now that this is done we just want to move on and enjoy our lives.’

Last night Cross said she was ‘more than pleased’ that the dispute was over, but refused to comment further.
