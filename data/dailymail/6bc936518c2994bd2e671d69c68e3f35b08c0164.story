Though he no longer works at Myspace, Tom Anderson, the co-founder of the website, has been keeping busy as a photographer. 

Under the username myspacetom on Instagram, Anderson has over 107,000 followers on the social media site. 

On Facebook, where he also posts many of his images, he has over 1.4million followers.

His photographs, which show beaches, city skylines, animals, sunrises and sunsets - as well as world-famous monuments including the Taj Mahal - regularly receives thousands of likes. 

Anderson's smiling Instagram profile photo is the same one which appeared on many MySpace users' profiles. 

'I started shooting at Burning Man,' Anderson told MailOnline in an email exchange. 'It's such a creative, wild environment. I can't think of a better place to begin an aesthetic life. Burning Man is like one big giant art installation in the middle of starkly beautiful desert landscape, and the attendees are creative in the way they dress. I began shooting there and was really happy with the results. I was immediately hooked.'

Regarding his equipment, Anderson revealed he '[uses] Nikon DSLRs and [post-processes] mostly in Photoshop and Lightroom. When people see a shot they like, they often ask me about the gear. 

'I can't stress enough how unimportant the camera really is. Any brand of camera will do. For 95% of my shots, the lowest end DSLR will be just fine. Expensive gear helps for night shots, but I wouldn't recommend beginners overspend on a camera. '

When asked about what is the most difficult thing to photograph, Anderson said 'Cameras are still limited when shooting directly into the sun. I put a lot of work into "rescuing" a sunset photo with blown out highlights or dark shadows. It's often the prettiest time of the day, but the best camera gear still can't easily capture the dynamism of extreme light.' 

As for question of what he enjoys photographing the most, Anderson revealed 'I live in Hawaii part time and love shooting the ocean, both long exposures that capture the movement of water and with a fast shutter speed to freeze the power and force of a wave. 

'I've not published many of these shots because they're hard to get right, and so many people do it better than me, but it's an awesome feeling to experience the wind, spray and crashing sound while shooting. It's one if the more visceral photographic experiences.'

Anderson, who has visited multiple countries in his adventures, told MailOnline his reasoning for picking locales is relatively straightforward. 

'Usually it's just from seeing photos of an awesome place,' he said. 'There's no real rhyme or reason to it, though I do try to go where the weather is likely to give me the conditions for a good shot. My friends are usually on a more restrictive schedule than me, so I may go where they want.'

Anderson said he is also surprised by the interest many have taken in his work. 

'I remember when I posted the first shots 3 years ago and people were immediately supportive,' he told MailOnline. 'I didn't realize so many people were interested in learning photography, but I guess it's one of those hobbies that is growing exponentially due to quality cameras getting cheaper, and the Internet giving people a rewarding environment to share their work.'

Anderson said he hopes to travel to 'Petra, Greece, Africa and Patagonia.' 

'I haven't made any plans for Africa, but the other three will likely happen in the next six months,' he said.
