A little girl who witnessed a massacre at her school in Pakistan has described how she cowered behind her desk as terrorists murdered her classmates - and how she hopes to one day become a doctor and help those hurt in terror attacks.

In an interview with Pakistani media, Shahid Khan said his daughter Eman is a three-year-old pupil at the Army Public School in Peshawar, where six Taliban militants gunned down 148 students and teachers.

She was told by her teacher Hafsa, who was later killed in the attack, to hide behind a desk when the killers stormed the school.

She said: 'I just shut my eyes as it was so horrible what was happening before me.

'I saw some very ugly guys enter the room and started shouting in a different language.

'My teacher asked me to go and hide behind the table and not look. They are bad people.'

Referring to the AK47 assault rifles the terrorists were using and the sounds of gunfire, Eman said: 'I don't know what things they had in their hands but I heard noises like the ones we hear in movies.

'I heard many of the students crying. They were feeling pain.'

'I was hidden behind the table and I was hidden there for a long time.' The stoic child doesn't know how long she stayed there before she was rescued.

She added: 'After long time a good man came and shook hands with me and asked me to come out. He said: "Dear, everything's fine now".'

When Eman was asked if she wished to continue her education, she said: 'I am a brave girl. I wish to study in same school.

'I am not scared. I wish to go back to school and play with my friends.

'I wish to go back to my studies and become a doctor. If the bad men do it again I will treat my brother and sisters. I am brave like my brother who is in hospital, and my father.'

Mr Khan is proud of the bravery his daughter showed in such terrifying circumstances.

The 40-year-old said: 'My daughter has proven she is a Pashtun girl, a brave girl.'

He also spoke of the hellish four hours he spent with no information about the fate of Eman and his son Ammar, who also attends the school.

He said: 'At the time the terrorist attack took place I was like a madman looking for my children, I was searching for Eman but there was nobody to tell me about her.

'After four hours an army officer asked me "Is your daughter's name Eman?"

'I was so scared to answer. I thought he had bad news about my daughter. But then I answered: "Yes, Eman is my daughter, tell me what happened to her".

'He said: "She is safe and you can take her with you". I cannot explain how glad I was to know about my beloved daughter.'

'Blood, flesh and body parts were scattered every where': Ehsan Elahi (centre) saw the 'lifeless faces of his friends' as he fled the hall during the massacre

But his joy was tempered with pain and fear immediately after.

'Your son is injured and is in military hospital,' the soldier told him.

Mr Khan added: 'My son was stable today when I saw him, his mother was crying for the whole night.

'I am a driver and whatever I earn is for my family. I cannot explain to you the pain I experienced for my daughter and son.'

The authorities in Pakistan reported that the school was only for boys, but Mr Khan disputed that. saying there is a separate wing for female students. 

Meanwhile, horrifying accounts from child survivors of the Pakistan school massacre continued to emerge. 

Student Aakif Azeem, 18, still wearing the green blazer of his unifrom, told the world: ‘You can rip up our school, you can take away our teachers, but you cannot take away our identity.

‘I was in the dining room when the gunmen started firing and one took a shot at me with a pistol, but the bullet ricocheted. There were children screaming and crying and there were bodies everywhere.

‘The corridors were dripping with blood. Even the teachers were terrified.

‘All I could think about was where my little brother was. Later I found out that out of a class of 25 who died, he was the only one who escaped unharmed.

‘We want our revenge. We are all innocent and had absolutely nothing to do with this.’

Student Siam Salam, 11, said: ‘I was in the classroom when we heard firing and I was very afraid. I didn’t see the gunman come in, but then I could heard the firing and bombs even louder.

‘I hid under my desk and waited until the army and ambulance arrived. Then I made a run for it out of the school. I didn't look back, I just ran until I got to the gate and escaped from the school.’

Yesterday the Pakistani prime minister lifted a moratorium on the death penalty, as the school reopened to reveal the terrifying aftermath of the atrocity, including Mrs Kazi's office, where a terrorist blew himself up.

The masscre led to calls for the death penalty to be restored. 'It was decided that this moratorium should be lifted. The prime minister approved,' said government spokesman Mohiuddin Wan, referring to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's approval of the decision by a ministerial committee.
