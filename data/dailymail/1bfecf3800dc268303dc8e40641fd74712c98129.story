Despicable: Monty Croke Sr, pictured, was jailed for five years for an eight-years swindle on a pensioner

A conman and his two sons swindled a pensioner with Parkinson's Disease out of more than £250,000 in what officers say is one of the most despicable frauds they have ever seen.

Monty Croke, 46, took £170,000 from the vulnerable man to build a holiday cottage - but instead of selling it and passing the proceeds to the victim, he lived in it himself.

As the con unfolded over eight years his sons Monty Jr and Billy, joined by accomplice James Coverdale, swindled the man for around £80,000 more by carrying out shoddy, unnecessary repairs on his home.

Eventually the men were tracked down when the victim's worried carer alerted the authorities and officers started probing their bank accounts.

In hours of covert footage they watched the men at work - including stationing a helicopter high above the cottage to track their movements.

They discovered the victim from Malton, North Yorkshire, was just one of a string of more than a dozen vulnerable people defrauded by the men.

Others included a 70-year-old man who lost £12,200 and a woman in her 80s suffering from dementia who lost more than £18,000.

They also took over £26,000 from a couple in their 80s and 90s, most of which came in just an eight-week period.

A further 12 victims were also defrauded of a total of £30,772.

The scams saw the men carrying out low-budget repairs on the victims' homes which were not needed in the first place.

Monty Croke Sr, 46, from Pickering, North Yorkshire, his sons Monty Jr, 26, and Billy, 23, from Knareborough, and James Coverdale, 35, from Pickering, all admitted conspiring to defraud householders.

Conmen: Croke Sr's sons Monty Jr (left) and Billy (right) were both jailed for their part in the scheme. Croke Jr, 26, was jailed for two and a half years and Billy, 23, was jailed for 12 months. A fourth offender avoided jail

The men also admitted paying victims' cheques into their bank accounts. Croke Sr and Billy Croke admitted three counts each and Croke Jr and Coverdale admitted two counts each of converting criminal property.

Yet even the worst offender in the scam could be released in just two and a half years.

Monty Croke Sr was jailed for five years, Monty Croke Jnr for two and a half years and Billy Croke for 12 months.

Coverdale avoided jail as he received a 15-month prison term suspended for two years.

The victim, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'I was completely taken in. Monty David Croke befriended me and he then betrayed my friendship. It was all one big lie.

'I hope this case serves as a warning to others about the dangers of doorstep callers and that it helps prevent others from being defrauded in the way I have been.'

His family said in a statement: 'It is difficult to comprehend the callousness of the people who inveigle their way into the lives of vulnerable people, groom them and often leave them in dire financial difficulties.

'It was only the vigilance of our brother’s carer that uncovered this matter and brought it to the attention of the authorities. Our family is indebted to her for all her care and kindness.'

North Yorkshire County Council's trading standards department began the investigation in October 2012.

Officers said the case against the Parkinson’s sufferer was the worst case of repeat victimisation they had ever encountered.

Sentencing them at Teesside Crown Court yesterday, Judge Tony Briggs said: 'The elderly and vulnerable are a growing part of our community, and frequently have vaulable assets which are attractive to the ruthless and greedy.'

He said Croke Snr had stripped the Malton victim of his assets and 'played him in a cunning and devious way.'

County Councillor Chris Metcalfe, executive member for trading standards, said: 'We are sadly getting used to investigating cases of this nature in trading standards.

'But this case has been shocking and distressing, even to those of us who are hardened to this type of appalling and heartless crime.

'That offenders such as these can undertake the ruthless exploitation of vulnerable adults in this way, often for prolonged periods, is disgusting and abhorrent.'

Consumer Minister Jenny Willott said: 'The sentences handed down today send out a clear message to those looking to break the law – we will catch you and bring you to justice.

'Reporting unscrupulous traders to the authorities is vital to catching rogues like these. Anyone with concerns about possible conmen should ring the Citizens Advice Consumer helpline on 08454 04 05 06.

'Trading Standards can then investigate claims against rogue businesses, take court action if necessary and make sure consumers get a fair deal.'
