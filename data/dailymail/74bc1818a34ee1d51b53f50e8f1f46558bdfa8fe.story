Kathy Griffin confronted potential Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann and asked her if she was born a bigot or had become one, the comedian has revealed.

The 50-year-old stand-up comic said that the congresswoman from Minnesota replied that she would have to get back to her with an answer.

The revelation came as Mrs Bachmann was found to have falsely claimed to have been late for a fundraiser because of a family reunion.

Clash: Kathy Griffin, left, asked Michele Bachmann if she was born a bigot

The GOP candidate was busted after her mother told reporters that her daughter had not been with her family.

Appearing on Conan O'Brien's chat show last night, Ms Griffin told how she met Mrs Bachmann while researching for her rally against Don't Ask, Don't Tell last year.

She said they bumped into each other on an escalator, but she thinks the congresswoman confused her with Today Show host Kathie Lee Gifford.

After asking her if she would support her rally to repeal the law banning homosexuals in the military, Ms Griffin said she asked: 'Congresswoman Bachmann, were you born a bigot or did you, like, grow into it?'

According to Ms Griffin, the Republican replied: 'That's a good question. I'm gonna have to get back to ya.'

Mrs Bachmann was today facing further embarrassment after it was revealed that she had claimed to be late for an event because of a family reunion she did not attend.

As Mrs Bachmann did a victory lap after her Iowa straw poll victory on Saturday, she repeatedly talked up her local credentials mentioning a family reunion on Sunday in the state.

After arriving late at a fundraiser in Waterloo that evening she told reporters she had been delayed because it had been a 'busy day'.

'We had a big family reunion just north of Waterloo,' she said.

But Mrs Bachmann's mother and two cousins told Politico that while her husband and children had attended the reunion she had not.

In a further humiliation the congresswoman today wrongly wished Elvis Presley a happy birthday on the anniversary of his death.

The Republican who has adopted the singer's song 'Promised Land' as somewhat of a campaign anthem told a crowd of 300 in Spartanburg that she wanted to say happy birthday to the King of Rock and Roll.

Someone in the crowd shouted back, 'He died today.'
