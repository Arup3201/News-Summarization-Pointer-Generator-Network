These remarkable images show the moment a young pelican chick's head almost disappears into the mouth of its mother as it hungrily takes advantage of feeding time.

The adult pelican can be seen to withstand what appears to be a rather uncomfortable feeding session to comfort her hungry youngster.

The chicks - aged just two to three months old - are reliant on their mother for food.

Photorapher Dikky Oesin, 38, took the images of the birds' feeding time at a zoo near his hometown of Jakarta, Indonesia.

The father of three takes his son there almost every week and seizes the opportunity to practice his photography.

Mr Oesin said: 'Strangely, this happened at a time when I just wanted to go home.

'But when I heard the noisy sounds of the birds crowded together, I decided to go and take a look.

'My son was very surprised when he saw the chick's head disappear into the mother's mouth - but for me, I was rather concerned about the mother.

'The beak of its chick is almost at the entrance to the stomach.'

The feeding process continued for around half an hour during which time Mr Oesin crept closer and closer to the pelicans - despite their intimidating size.

An average adult pelican stands at about one and a half metres tall.

Mr Oesin said: 'I went from being 15-20 metres away to taking photos just three metres from the birds.

'They didn't mind our presence - especially as we were by the zoo keeper who was feeding them fresh fish.'
