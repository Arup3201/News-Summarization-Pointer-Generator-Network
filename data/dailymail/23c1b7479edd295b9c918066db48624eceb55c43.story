Losers: New York Jets quarterback Tim Tebow is seen on the sidelines of Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks where the Jets lost 28-7 and teammates called him 'terrible'

The players on the New York Jets have come to a consensus on Tim Tebow: He's no good at football.

Tebow became the most famous player in the league last season for improbably leading a mediocre Denver Broncos team into the playoffs.

This season, more than a dozen of his teammates in New York spoke out to say he's a dud.

'He's terrible,' an unnamed Jets defensive starter told the New York Daily News.

Tebow claims he has worked hard in practice and improved significantly over the season. Other New York Jets players disagree.

The 25-year-old quarterback was brought to New York as a possible replacement for struggling starter Mark Sanchez.

But, even though Sanchez is having one of the worst seasons of his career, with the lowest passing rate in the league, teammates don't see him as a viable second option.

'We don't really have a choice,' left guard Matt Slauson told the paper of their continual use of Mark Sanchez as their quarterback.

After Jets' 28-7 loss in Seattle on Sunday which featured Tebow in limited use, cornerback Antonio Cromartie said that anyone calling for Tebow to take over 'can kiss my ass.'

Reacting to his teammates' scathing criticisms on Wednesday, Tebow admitted feeling 'some frustration and I guess some sadness' to the Daily News.

'You’re human. It’s not always fun having people saying negative things about you, but you try to be stronger from it. It always has made me stronger in the past and it will continue to make me stronger,' he said.

But Sanchez’ arm is hardly anything to boast of, according to NFL statistics, where the quarterback shows the lowest NFL ranking among completion percentages – 52 per cent – and first for four red-zone interceptions.

Tebow, the most popular non-starting quarterback in the league's history, reports Pro-Football Talk, has yet to score for the team in nine games played since his trade from the Broncos in March.

‘We don’t look at him as a quarterback,’ another starter told the paper. ‘He’s the Wildcat guy.’

Perhaps further backing Slauson’s opinion on plays, when Jets Head Coach Rex Ryan was asked his thoughts on swapping in Tebow for Sanchez - following Sanchez' completion of just nine of 22 passes against the Seattle Seahawks - Ryan was animated when telling NFL reporters he'd hear nothing of it.

Cowards: Head Coach Rex Ryan said he's addressed the team's criticisms, especially on those said anonymously which he described as cowardly

'I believe we can win with Mark. And I believe we can win with Tebow, but I'm not going to let you or anybody else convince me out of it, OK? ... He gives us the best opportunity to win games, and that's the only reason I make any move,' he said.

Ryan told the paper he 'absolutely' addressed the Daily News’ report with his team on Wednesday morning, calling the attacks 'cowardly.'

'I think it’s a cowardly thing. If you’re not going to put your name to it, I think that’s about as cowardly of a thing as there is,' he said.

On his little use of Tebow - sidelined for an average of seven out of eight plays - he said: 'I absolutely wanted Tim here ... I was very honest from Day 1, and 
I've never gotten off that.'

He added having mixed agreement with Slauson's words but respect for him not hiding behind them.

With a dreary 3-6 game season, contributed by their Seahawks loss, the Jets currently face missing the postseason for what would be the second consecutive year.

To some their absence could name them all 'terrible,' or at least those playing.
