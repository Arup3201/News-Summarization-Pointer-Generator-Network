Nasa could lose touch with its latest Mars rover just as it attempts to land on the red planet on 6 August.

The Curiosity vehicle, which is the size of a car, is aiming for a deep depression known as Gale Crater.

The US space agency will be tracking the descent with satellites, but today admitted its key craft could be in the wrong place.

Engineers have been tackling a fault on the Odyssey satellite and it is no longer in the best observational orbit.

The team are now in a frantic race to move it back in the next three weeks, or Nasa will lose signal to the rover just as it is about to touch down.

Engineers today tried to play down the gaffe, claiming it will not affect the outcome of the landing because Curiosity's descent manoeuvres are all performed automatically.

'Odyssey right now looks like it may not be in the same spot that we'd expected it to be,' said Doug McCuistion, the director of Nasa's Mars exploration programme.

'There may be some changes in real-time communication. We'll let you know as this develops; we still have more work to do. But keep in mind, there is no risk to [Curiosity] landing. It does not have an effect on that.'

A recent study suggested that just digging inches beneath the surface could 
uncover complex organic molecules that could show that life once existed
on Mars.

The rover, in a protective capsule, will hit the top of the Martian atmosphere at 20,000km/h (13,000mph) and attempt to slow to just one metre per second to execute a soft touchdown.

The landing system includes a supersonic parachute and a rocket-powered crane.

It was expected that the Odyssey orbiter would track the whole descent, relaying UHF signals from the rover right up to the landing and for a few minutes beyond.

The scoop on
Curiosity, which is due to arrive on Mars in August, will dig four 
inches beneath the surface - enough to find the complex building blocks 
of life, particularly in new craters excavated by recent asteroid 
impacts.

Some scientists such as Jay Melosh of 
Purdue University believe that life may even have originated on Mars, 
then been carried to Earth on asteroids.

Stick
a shovel in the ground and scoop. That’s about how deep scientists need
to go in order to find evidence for ancient life on Mars, if there is 
any to be found, a new study suggests.

The
results suggest that, should Mars harbor simple organic molecules, 
NASA’s prospects for discovering them during Curiosity’s explorations 
are better than previously thought, said Alexander Pavlov of the NASA 
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, lead author of the 
study.

Complex organic molecules could hint more strongly at the possibility of past life on the planet. These molecules, made up of 10 or more carbon atoms, could resemble known building blocks of life such as the amino acids that make up proteins.

However, within 2 to 4 inches beneath the surface, the amount of radiation reduces tenfold. Although that’s still extreme, the team reports that simple organic molecules, such as a single formaldehyde molecule, could exist at this depth -- and in some places, specifically young craters, the complex building blocks of life could remain as well.

‘Right
now the challenge is that past Martian landers haven’t seen any organic
material whatsoever,’ Pavlov said. ‘We know that organic molecules have
to be there but we can’t find any of them in the soil.’

Its
assignment is to investigate whether conditions have been favorable for
microbial life and for preserving clues in the rocks about possible 
past life.

The goal of the 
mission is to assess whether the landing area has ever had or still has 
environmental conditions favorable to microbial life.

Curiosity
will land near the foot of a layered mountain inside Gale crater, 
layers of this mountain contain minerals that form in water.

The portion of the crater floor where Curiosity will land has an alluvial fan likely formed by water-carried sediments.

Curiosity will also carry the 
most advanced load of scientific gear ever used on Mars’ surface, a more
than 10 times as massive as those of earlier Mars rovers.

Curiosity
is about twice as long and five times as heavy as NASA’s twin Mars 
Exploration Rovers,

When
evaluating how deep organic molecules might persist beneath the 
surface, previous studies have mainly focused on the maximum depth, 
approximately 1.5 meters (5 feet), that cosmic radiation reaches because
beyond that point organic molecules could survive, unharmed, for 
billions of years, Pavlov said.

Curiosity
is set to land in Gale crater on August 6. Whether this 
3.5-billion-year-old crater has fresher craters within it is uncertain. 
However, Pavlov hopes that his team’s findings will at least help guide 
NASA on where to drill once the rover has landed and influence where 
future generations of rover landers will touch down.
