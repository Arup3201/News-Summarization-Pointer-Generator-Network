A British man has died Cyprus in front of his fiancee while trying to save a pensioner from drowning.

Keith West, 50, was walking along a promenade on the first day of his holiday in Cyprus, when he spotted an elderly man in difficulty in the sea and ran to his aid.

Mr West, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, managed to pull the old man to dry land but lost his own footing in a strong undercurrent, and was dragged beneath the water, disappearing from sight.

A lifeguard who was helping with the rescue effort on the beach risked his own life to enter the water - but it was ten minutes before Keith was found and brought to the surface.

Keith's fiancee Julie Davies witnessed the tragedy unfold.

Mr West's family described him as a hero who carried out life-saving lessons when he was younger

The couple were planning to get married on the Greek island next year, and had travelled there to look for venues for their wedding ceremony and reception.

Ms Davies has now been joined by some of Mr West's devastated brothers and sisters, who have flown to Cyprus to help make arrangements for him to be brought home.

Floral tributes have been laid on the beach where Mr West, an electrician known as Tufty, lost his life.

Speaking on behalf of the family, brother-in-law Garry Fisher, 56, said the death had shattered the family.

'Keith died a hero. It is such a waste of a good man's life and all in the space of a few seconds,' Mr Fisher said, who is married to Keith's sister Yvonne.

'Nobody can believe it - Keith was such a strong swimmer, he did lifesaving badges when he was younger.

'Keith and Julie were walking along the promenade when they saw an elderly couple in difficulty in the water and could hear the woman shouting 'help'.

'They rushed down to the sea and where the man was, and it was only knee high, but there must have been a strong under current because he couldn't get out.

'Keith went in and managed to pass him over to a lifeguard, but then the undercurrent took hold of him and he went under.

'It took the lifeguard 10 minutes to find him and bring him up to the surface.

'Keith died a hero and we are all very proud of what he did, trying to save someone's life, but we are just devastated at what happened to him.

'He was an absolutely brilliant man with a dry sense of humour. He will be badly missed.'

His sister Paula Robjohns, 41, also hailed her brother a hero.

'All he would have been thinking is that he needed to help,' she said.
