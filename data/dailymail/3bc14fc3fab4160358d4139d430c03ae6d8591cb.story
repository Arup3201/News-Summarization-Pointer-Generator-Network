Marijuana smoking laws have been relaxed by Denver City Council, allowing residents to smoke in full view of the general public, so long as it's done on the users' own balcony or front yard.

The bill was approved by a vote of 10-3 on Monday night, according to The Denver Post, representing a complete about-face on the issue.

Just two weeks ago the council gave preliminary approval to an amendment that would have banned marijuana use on private property if it could be seen or smelled by others.

Out in the open: Residents in Denver, Colorado, are now allowed to smoke in public view, such as a front yard, porch or balcony, so long as it is on private property with the expressed permission of the property owner

The amendment was brought forward by councilwoman Jeanne Robb, who was against the 2012 legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington state for persons over 21.

In her proposal for a public ban, Robb said seeing people light up would send a dangerous message to children and would paint the city in a 'negative smoky haze'.

'We are being looked at nationally,' she told FoxNews.

'It’s really a balance of the rights of those who consume marijuana and the localities where they live.

'The message is clear: do not be blatant. Be discreet. Not in our streets, not in our sidewalks.'

However a week later, council members reversed their position and adopted another amendment.

The revised measure regulates marijuana in a similar way to that of alcohol, allowing people to smoke on their properties or with permission from the property, even if in public view.

Labeled council Bill No. 13-736, it remains illegal for anyone to consume marijuana in public or for anyone under 21 to be possession of the drug.

The first violation of those rules can be punished with a $150 fine.

A second violation carries a $500 fine and each subsequent violation carries a $999 fine.

Monday's decision to pass the measure is final, the council said.

Also this week, a new website was launched as part of a public education effort.

In Colorado, legal pot sales start on January 1.

The new site, MarijuanaInfoDenver.org, is intended to be an informational overview of marijuana laws in Denver, but authorities remind people that it’s up to them to know the laws.

Marijuana remains illegal under federal law.

As few as five to ten Denver-area stores will be licensed to dispense marijuana come the New Year, with over 100 businesses still awaiting approval.
