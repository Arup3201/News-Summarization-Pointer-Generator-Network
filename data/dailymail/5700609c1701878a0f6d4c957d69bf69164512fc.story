The birth of Kylie Bisutti's son on Tuesday night was a family affair, with her husband performing the delivery at their home in Montana.

The 23-year-old former Victoria's Secret model shared a picture of the two loves of her life on Instagram, captioning the shot: 'This man delivered this baby today!!! :) so blessed and so thankful to God for our new little baby boy! What a blessing! My two guys here!'

In the image, her husband Mike, 38, grins broadly as he cradles the baby boy in his arms, who is wrapped in a yellow blanket, squinting his eyes.

The birth of her first child came just days after her mother gave birth to her own baby, a girl born on January 10.

Mrs Bisutti announced that she would be welcoming her first child with an at-home birth earlier this month, sharing a picture of the bathtub where she intended to deliver.

The tub was surrounded by keepsake photographs and Bible scriptures. She captioned the image: 'So excited that God willing this is where we will be bringing our little baby into the world!'

She added that she was looking forward 
to having her child 'in the comfort of our own home & surrounded by 
my wedding pictures and scripture with my husband delivering our little 
gift!!!'

In August, she released her own take on fashion with her label God 
Inspired Fashion, a denim and T-shirt brand that is printed with bible 
scriptures and iconography.
