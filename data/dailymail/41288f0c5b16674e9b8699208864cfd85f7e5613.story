Andros Townsend has made a surprising defence of Emmanuel Adebayor by claiming Tottenham’s controversial striker is working hard.

Townsend praised his team-mate’s performance in the Capital One Cup win over League One Sheffield United on Wednesday, saying: ‘Emmanuel played well and hopefully he can get another run out on Saturday and get a goal. He’s a fantastic player. He worked hard and hopefully fans can see that.

‘The 60-odd minutes he played on Wednesday he worked extremely hard and that’s all we can judge him on.

Emannuel Adebayor returned to Tottenham's starting line-up against Sheffield United in the League Cup

‘The manager’s picked him to start because he’s got his head down and showed he deserves to be in the squad. He’s got himself fit and he got his reward.’

Tottenham fans were shocked when manager Mauricio Pochettino made Adebayor captain against Sheffield United. The striker, who had not started a game for two months through a combination of illness, injury and compassionate leave, did little to justify the armband before being booed by fans when substituted after 64 minutes.

It was the second successive game in which Adebayor was jeered by his own fans and he admitted after his substitute appearance against Sunderland he was not at White Hart Lane to endear himself to supporters. He alienated them again on Wednesday and managed to hit his two shots well wide.

But Townsend, who scored a penalty to give his side a 1-0 advantage for next week’s second leg at Bramall Lane, said Adebayor is ‘a great player to have’.

‘He’s a funny character: always joking, always dancing,’ said Townsend, ‘He’s a great guy to have around, a fantastic character.’

It was a frustrating night in front of goal for Adebayor, who was substituted with 25 minutes left to play
