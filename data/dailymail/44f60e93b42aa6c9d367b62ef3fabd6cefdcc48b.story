Carnival season is big news in Germany, and the FC Cologne squad have celebrated the opening day of their city's carnival by training in wigs and various costumes.

One of the most famous carnivals in Germany is in Cologne, and it traditionally begins on the 11th minute of the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. That moment came on Tuesday, and the Cologne squad certainly did not let it slip.

Arriving at training in clown costumes, police uniforms and 'Where's Wally?' outfits, they looked the part as they joked around during the session.

The carnival kicked off at 11:11 on the 11/11, a moment the players marked by doing the conga through the streets of Cologne

At one point, the squad created a conga through the streets in matching wigs and red noses, while stunned onlookers took photographs as they passed. 

The opening day of the carnival is known as 'Fat Tuesday', and the week-long street festival is also called 'the crazy days'.

On the football field, Cologne are 10th in the Bundesliga after a hard-fought 4-3 win over Hoffenheim at the weekend.

They have won four matches of their last five, including a win over Borussia Dortmund... the fans have every reason to be celebrating during the carnival.

Head coach Peter Stoger was not exempt from the madness... he donned some traditional German shorts for the session
