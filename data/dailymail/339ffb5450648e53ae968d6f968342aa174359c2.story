Three men were today blasted to death by suspected gangsters as they travelled up a mountain road on the French island of Corsica. The terrifying attack comes less than a week after the same number of people, including a British couple, were murdered in similar circumstances as they sat in a BMW car at an Alpine beauty spot in mainland France.

The latest shooting was in a hamlet called 
Pont-de-Castirla, close to the village of Castirla, in north 
Corsica

Notorious: Corsica regularly sees bandits attacking each other with guns and bombs

A local judicial source said that the car was hit by 'a volley of snipers' bullets' which killed everybody.

At least one of the victims was 
'known to the police' with a suspected 'settling of accounts' being the 
motive for the attack, said the same source.

Corsica is notorious for its criminal gangs, with bandits regularly attacking each other with guns and bombs.

Horrifying: The bullet-ridden car discovered last week where the bodies of the Al-Hilli family were all lying dead inside their BMW car

Since the beginning of 2012 there have been no less than 13 murders using guns on the island, and nine attempted murders.

Saad al-Hilli, 50, the father murdered near the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy, in the Haute-Savoie region of France, last Wednesday.

Corsica, the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte, is close to Italy, but is split into two department of France, and has a population of just over 300,000.

The attack on the outskirts of the village of Chevaline, close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France saw the brutal murders of Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 47, her mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74, and Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old French cyclist.

The Al-Hilli's seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, suffered a fractured skull after being hit round the head, and also had a bullet in a shoulder, while their four-year-old daughter, Zeena, escaped unhurt after hiding underneath the bodies of her relatives.

Police in Corsica said there was no suspected links between the attack on their island and the one in the Alps.
