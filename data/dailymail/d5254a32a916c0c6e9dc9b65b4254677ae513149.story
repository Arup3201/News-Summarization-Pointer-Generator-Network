A father of four has died after suffering a massive allergic reaction to a horsefly bite.

Andy Batty, 48, collapsed in agony and was dead before paramedics arrived in a helicopter.

The 6ft engineer went into anaphylactic shock while helping his daughter, Catherine, 17, ride her pony, Bess.

Andrew Batty, from Devon, went into anaphylactic shock after being bitten by a horsefly in a field. He died almost immediately and was pronounced death when paramedics arrived shortly after

Two ambulances and the helicopter were
scrambled to a field where Catherine had been riding at 12.30pm on 
Sunday, but Mr Batty was pronounced dead at the scene.

Last night, Dr Pamela Ewan, an allergy
consultant at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, said: ‘Death from a 
horsefly bite is incredibly rare.

‘Most people develop a small swelling 
and some will go on to develop an infection but to suffer anaphylactic 
shock is pretty unheard of.’

Mr Batty died almost immediately and was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.

Horsefly bites develop into large, red itchy bumps within minutes but are usually harmless.

Doctors usually recommend using an over-the-counter steroid cream 
containing hydrocortisone,'

However
it is important not to use too much as such creams can produce their 
own allergic reactions. Ibuprofen gel can also help 
with pain and swelling.

It is important to keep the bite 
clean because if bacteria gets into the skin, in very rare cases it can 
cause cellulitis, an infection of the soft tissues.

Symptoms include hot, swollen skin, nausea and high temperature.

In
exceptional cases the victim can suffer an allergic reaction with 
symptoms including dizziness, difficulty breathing, a blotchy rash and 
severe swelling that may be visible in your lips or tongue and cause 
nausea.

If you suffer any of these reactions, seek medical help immediately.

She said it was likely that Mr Batty 
had been bitten by a horsefly before, adding: ‘This then triggered his  
body’s immune system to create  allergic antibodies.

‘But he would need to be genetically predisposed to suffering such a  severe reaction.’

Dr Bill Frankland, consultant 
allergist at the London Allergy Clinic, said: ‘The man will have 
probably died within 15 minutes of being bitten. It’s normally a very 
sudden death.’

But he added: ‘This is a very unusual 
case, people shouldn’t worry if they get bitten by a horsefly as the 
likelihood of someone being this allergic is extremely rare.’

Catherine had lived with her father since the keen rugby fan and former taxi driver separated from her mother several years ago.

Mr Batty also had three children from a former marriage, James, Michael and Rachel.

Last night, friends paid tribute to the ‘jolly giant’, of Brixham in Devon.

Chris Forster, chairman of Brixham Rugby Club, where Mr Batty worked as a steward, said: ‘Andy’s death is very sad.

‘I spoke to his daughter,  who he was absolutely devoted to. It is very raw for her. She is in shock.

‘He always did what he could to help. He was very well liked. Everyone at the club has been saddened by the news.’

Colleagues at KJ Engineering described Mr Batty as fit, healthy and strong.

Manager Keith Iszard said: ‘Andy was a big fellow, very broad like a rugby front-row man. He could lift any weight.

‘We couldn’t believe a small fly could knock him down.

‘His death has come as a massive shock
to everyone.  Andy was a lovely man – a jolly giant, always very 
friendly and would volunteer to help anyone. Everyone liked him.’

Horsefly bites develop into large, itchy bumps within minutes but are usually harmless. It is important to keep bites clean because if bacteria gets into skin, it can cause cellulitis, an infection of the soft tissues

Mr Batty’s friend John  Rugman, 61, said: ‘He was  a fantastic father. He doted  on Catherine.

‘He was so proud of her. He was an 
absolutely fantastic man, he would do anything for anybody without 
question. He was a great friend and we’re absolutely devastated by the 
shocking news.’

Horseflies are members of the bloodsucking tabanidae family of insects.

They frequently attack humans and 
livestock and are regarded as pests because their bites can carry 
diseases and parasites. Horsefly bites are notoriously painful because –
unlike a mosquito, which pierces the skin –  the insect uses its 
powerful jaws to rip into the flesh so it can feast on blood.

They can cause rashes, dizziness, 
wheezing, swelling  and infection, but anyone who has been bitten 
normally makes a full recovery.

The bites usually swell into large, red, itchy bumps and can very occasionally become infected if they are not kept clean
