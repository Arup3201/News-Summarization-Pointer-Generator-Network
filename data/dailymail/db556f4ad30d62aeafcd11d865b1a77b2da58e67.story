Free: David Magnan admits killing two women and a man but a court has agreed his release

A 50-year-old Oklahoma man who admitted killed three people has had his death sentence reversed because the murders happened on Native American land, meaning the state lacks the authority to prosecute him.

David Magnan's murder convictions were voided by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and he was ordered to be released from death row, where he has been held since 2004.

A three-judge panel said they presumed federal authorities would arrest and prosecute Magnan 'given the nature of the crimes and Magnan's admitted guilt'.

Attorney General Scott Pruitt's office was reviewing the decision on Friday, a spokesman said.

One option is to request a rehearing before all nine members of the Denver-based court.

Magnan, who is part of the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux tribes, shot dead three members of the Seminole Nation and injured another tribe member in Seminole County, which Oklahoma has no jurisdiction over.

He had been sentenced to death on each murder count and received a life sentence on the remaining count.

However, he appealed his conviction, arguing that because the crimes occurred on 'Indian Nation' land, the state had no right to prosecute him. 

On reservations, however, only federal and tribal laws apply to members of the tribe, unless Congress has ruled otherwise.

About 56.2 million acres of land is held in trust for Native Americans under treaties from tribes who had to cede huge tracts of their homeland. 

The largest of these is the 16 million-acre Navajo Nation Reservation in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah but many reservations cover less than 1,000 acres.

The Seminole County reservation, where Magnan shot dead two women and a man, covers 372 acres about 45 miles outside Oklahoma City.

The court that agreed Magnan's release agreed the shootings occurred on land that was historically Native American.

'We conclude that the tract, at the time
of Magnan's crimes, was "Indian country", and that exclusive 
jurisdiction over those crimes rests with the United States,' the 
decision stated.

The ruling reverses a Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals decision, which ruled the state's criminal jurisdiction was proper.

The
federal court's ruling hinges on the history of land that was 
originally part of a 200-acre parcel of land allotted to a full-blooded 
member of the Seminole Nation at the turn of the last century.

The property passed to his heirs, one of whom decided to build a home there.

It was in that home that Magnan shot dead two women and a man who had gathered with friends and family to celebrate a birthday.

He
had not been at the party, but later drove to the house with two other 
men. When he arrived he shot and injured Eric Coley, who had come 
outside to speak to him.

According to his plea in April 2009, Magnan says he walked into the house where he saw James Howard in a bed near the kitchen.

'When the old man looked up at him, Magnan said “goodbye” and shot him, intending to kill him,' court documents state.

Magnan told the court he went into the bedroom intending to say goodbye to Karen Wolf, but 'when she “got smart” with him, he shot her'.

His third victim was Lucilla McGirt, who was in the bed next to Ms Wolf. She died from complications from her gunshot wounds two weeks after the shooting.

Because the American Indian heir of the property never obtained approval of the Secretary of Interior to remove restrictions on the part of the land he had bought from his siblings, it is still considered Indian land, a court ruled.

Magnan has been held on death row at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, but if a federal court arrests him and finds him guilty he is less likely to be given the death sentence, according to OK News.

Although his conviction has been 
overturned, Magnan must remain in prison until the court issues its 
mandate, which can take 21 days unless the state asks for postponement.
