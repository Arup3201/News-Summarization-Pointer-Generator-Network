Roberto Mancini is anticipating a ‘spectacular challenge’ for Roma from his former club Manchester City on Tuesday night.

The 49-year-old, who led City to the Premier League title in 2012, gave an insight into where the Champions League clash at the Etihad will be won and lost in Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport.

Who are Roma’s dangermen?

A complete Roma can beat City but the absences of Daniele De Rossi, Leandro Castan and Davide Astori make them more vulnerable.

I have seen Juan Iturbe has been called up to the squad — he can create problems. In the counter-attack he can be devastating.

Francesco Totti turned 38 at the weekend but is still important because, with the class he has, he knows how to move around the field. He runs less, but he makes the ball run.

Mattia Destro and Seydou Keita will both play important roles for Roma on Tuesday night

Mattia Destro scored a spectacular goal at the weekend. He has quality. I remember him at Inter. His technical ability is not under discussion, but he must grow. Young people often think when success comes on the field that their growth has finished. That is not so. Talent must be trained every day.

Seydou Keita could mark Yaya Toure. Keita is a player I have always admired. At nearly 35, he belongs to the category of players who are incomprehensibly undervalued.

Who is City’s player to watch?

Yaya Toure. The midfielder is a force of nature who City are seeing the best of. Then there is the class of David Silva, the goalscoring instinct of Sergio Aguero and the running of Pablo Zabaleta.

Yaya Toure is Manchester City's main man that Roma need to be wary of

City are a great team. They have been strong for several years and each year they manage to improve, buying very good players.

At home they always express themselves well, they are very solid, they have so much possession and they have unpredictable players. The Premier League title will be between them and Chelsea.

How do you beat City?

The key is a fast start and to take advantage of the opportunities they offer. Roma have to be careful in defence, concentrate for 90 minutes and be clinical in attack.

City practise a different style of football to the others in England — infinite passes, the ball on the ground, the ability to switch between patterns of attack in the middle or on the wings. 

City are not the Manchester United of a few years ago, all running and competitiveness. This could be an advantage for Roma.
