Garry Monk is ready to take his place in the 'madhouse' after being appointed as manager of Barclays Premier League club Swansea.

Monk has spoken with several of his new managerial colleagues in English football's top flight after landing a three-year contract at the Liberty Stadium.

'A lot of them said "welcome to the madhouse". In fact, pretty much every one of them has said that,' said Monk, who revealed via his Twitter account on Friday night that he had officially retired as a player.

'I think the bottom line is, out of all the advice I have had, the most important bit is that they have just said be yourself, don't try and be something else.

'For me it has to be that way. You have to learn from what you have done, and that is what I am going to do.

'I have it clear in my mind what I want, and though I am not going to say it's going to be easy to get there, I will try to get there.

'For me, Tony Pulis (Crystal Palace manager) was one of the best I spoke to, to be honest.

'After the game (against Swansea) he came in and spoke. It was a proper manager speaking. He was very honest about his group and my group and the way they work, why they do it. I found it very interesting.

'There have been quite a few managers, and all of them I have spoken to have been good to me. They have been very supportive and encouraging.'

Monk has been elevated from the head-coaching role he took on in early February after Swansea dispensed with Michael Laudrup's managerial services.

During that time, despite a few setbacks in terms of results, he ultimately guided Swansea away from relegation danger and towards mid-table heading into Sunday's season finale at Sunderland.

'It hasn't really sunk in. All I have been thinking about is the games,' he added.

'Everything that happened in the week was great, but we've got a game on Sunday. I went home and I was just planning the training sessions for the next day and what I would say to the players regarding the Sunderland game. I didn't want to make it too much of a distraction to anyone else.

'Because it's not about me right now, it's about finishing the season, and I guess when I get to the summer I will probably reflect upon what has gone on and the magnitude of it.'

For his part, Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins has no doubt about Monk's qualities.

The Swans have a track record for getting managerial appointments right, as shown by former bosses like Roberto Martinez and Brendan Rodgers, and Jenkins feels that Monk is from a familiar mould.

'Like every decision we make, whatever manager you bring in is a gamble. You only have to look to other Premier League clubs to see what has gone on to see that 10 or so managers have changed," Jenkins said.

'That argument is completely overshadowed by the fact every club needs, first and foremost, good people you can work with and people you think will take on the challenge, and I think as always at our club look to build their experience and improve things and set their mark.

'The biggest qualities are commitment and a passion for the job and working for Swansea City with the way we want to work. He (Monk) has got the thirst to learn and grow in experience.

'The other side is every young manager in his position will make mistakes, like experienced managers do. You just hope while he's learning we still carry on and achieve success, That is all you can hope for.

'He has got ideas and thoughts of how he would like to implement some of the way we work in the backroom staff like other managers have, and I can see that growing as he gains in confidence as he goes along.'Â
