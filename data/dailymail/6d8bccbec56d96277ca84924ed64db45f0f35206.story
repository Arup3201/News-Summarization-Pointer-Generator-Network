Roy Hodgson claimed England could win the World Cup on Monday as he prepares to unleash his young Lions in Brazil.

The England manager was in bullish mood after naming a refreshing 23-man squad. Eight outfield players are under the age of 24. As revealed in Sportsmail on Monday, Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley, Jordan Henderson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Raheem Sterling, Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck all made the cut.

Sportsmail has been campaigning for the manager to put his faith in the country’s young talent, and on Monday Hodgson said: ‘I believe this squad can win the World Cup, otherwise what’s the point? If we’re going to win it, we’ll have to play very well, and this talented group have to show their talent.

‘We’re right to have some degree of optimism. We’ll feed off that and do everything to make sure we don’t let our country down.

‘I am excited about the squad, I am excited that there are young players in there who have a future. Their future has to be immediately. I have selected them because I believe they could go into the team and play well, just as I see them play well in the Premier League every weekend.

‘There will be pressure on them and there is no way of relieving that pressure. I feel a sense of positivity around the general public because they are hoping we will play well and do well.

‘As the England manager taking a team to the World Cup, you have to accept there is going to be pressure on you and everyone wants you to do well.

‘I don’t really see a point in trying to fool people and play it down.’

Among those overlooked by Hodgson was striker Jermain Defoe, who was expecting to go to Brazil having been a squad regular for the past two years.

‘It’s hard even to find words to describe how I am feeling,’ said Defoe, 31, who left Tottenham earlier this year for a lucrative contract at MLS side Toronto FC.

‘I felt I had done enough. I feel sharper than ever and I have been on form and scored goals.

‘To miss out, I feel devastated. I didn’t really feel I had to sell myself to the manager. I had a situation at the 2012 Euros where I lost my dad and I had a decision to make. But I chose to go back out to Poland and Ukraine because I know how important it is to play for your country.’

In keeping with the squad’s youthful flavour, Hodgson named Liverpool defender Jon Flanagan, 21, and Everton centre half John Stones, 19, on his seven-strong standby list amid concerns over the fitness of Jones.

The Manchester United defender has a bruised shoulder, but Hodgson hopes he will make a full recovery by the time he nominates his final 23 on June 2.

Flanagan and Stones will travel to Portugal with England as the team’s medics continue to monitor Jones.

The other standby players — John Ruddy, Michael Carrick, Andy Carroll, Defoe and Tom Cleverley — are free to go on holiday.

Hodgson admitted he would be prepared to make an SOS call to Ashley Cole if Leighton Baines picked up an injury before England’s opening game against Italy on June 14. Cole announced his international retirement on Sunday after rejecting the chance to be on Hodgson’s standby list and has no intention of playing for England again.

But it is possible to bring in a replacement between June 2-13 if a player picks up an injury that rules him out of the tournament.

Rio Ferdinand was injured in the build-up to South Africa 2010 and replaced by Michael Dawson. Hodgson said: ‘Ashley Cole isn’t really a cover player. Ashley is a No 1 man.

‘When I decided Leighton Baines might be No 1, then I decided the next one would be Luke Shaw.‘Circumstances could make the decision a very good one or it could make it a very bad one.’
