It was the bridesmaid's dress that launched a star. When Pippa Middleton stepped onto the red carpet to pick up sister Kate's train at the royal wedding, the world let out a collective gasp.

With many pontificating on its suitability for a maid-of-honour - many thought it was too bridal for a supporting role - it's no surprise that the dress that so caught the imagination of the public is now the most requested in bridal ateliers - but it's brides, rather than bridesmaids who are besotted.

In response to the demand, department store Debenhams has released its own collection in homage to the royal wedding, and to Pippa in particular.

Inspired: A replica of the dress worn by Pippa Middleton for the Royal Wedding in April is to go on sale at Debenhams for just £170

Desirable: Pippa's Alexander McQueen bridesmaid's dress won her the adulation of the masses - now they can get their hands on a version at Debenhams

But while Pippa's bespoke Alexander 
McQueen gown cost a staggering £20,000, Debenhams' limited edition 
version is a snip at just £170.

So
great is the anticipated demand that the retailer has taken the unusual
step of creating a ‘lady-in-waiting list’ to allow customers to reserve
the departments store’s homage to Pippa Middleton’s figure-hugging 
bridesmaid gown ahead of its launch later this year.

Such
is the demand for all things Pippa, the retailer will also stock a 
£99 version of the emerald green Alice Temperley evening gown that Pippa 
wore to the evening reception at Buckingham Palace.

Green with envy? The department store has even created a replica of the emerald Alice Temperley gown worn by Pippa for her sister's evening wedding reception

In
homage to Kate is a black lace sweetheart cocktail-length dress - 
inspired by her magnificent Alexander McQueen wedding gown.

There is even a 
flower girl dress cinched with wide gold ribbon that echoes that of the 
bridal party, to go on sale for just £48 to £52 depending on age.

Russell Fish, head of occasionwear design at Debenhams said: 'Like everyone we
were glued to our tellies for the wedding and have been huge Kate and 
Pippa fans ever since.

'We taken the best of the dresses and added our designer twist. Now you can get the Middletons’ look at High Street prices.'

Alain Mehada, chief personal shopper at Debenhams' Oxford Street flagship, 
added: 'Both men and women everywhere were instantly talking about 
Pippa, so naturally brides-to-be will want to emulate her classic look –
both for themselves or their bridesmaids.

'We have been 
inundated by customers asking if we have anything similar to the dresses
worn by Kate, Pippa and the flower girls, but the ivory dress worn by 
Pippa is the most requested by far.'
