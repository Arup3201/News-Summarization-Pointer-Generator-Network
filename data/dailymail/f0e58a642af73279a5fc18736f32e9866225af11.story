A courageous 20-year-old woman lost her leg in a tragic accident on Monday November 11 when a hit and run driver crashed into her scooter as she was crossing Martin 
Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Ana Kessel isn't letting her amputation get her
down. The video game enthusiast and former graphics intern at Insomniac
Games is keeping friends updated on her recovery process via facebook.

Kessel also set up a support page on gofundme.com to help raise money for her steep medical bills and to help her pay her student loans. So far she's raised over $25,000 and has positive encouragement from friends and even strangers.

Ana was taken to Wake Med in North Carolina with critical injuries and doctors had to amputate her leg

Michael Deontea Jones fled the bloody seen after hitting poor Ana but police managed to track him down and throw him in jail

The
23-year-old driver, Micheal Deontea Jones, has been charged with a 
felony hit and run and for driving without a license. He is currently 
behind bars at the Wake County Detention Center, reported ABC news.

Just one week after the accident Kessel wrote on her facebook, 'It's just all surreal. Aside from the constant physical pain i'm in, and being a little slow from all the drugs i'm taking and hitting my head, I'm doing great!! I'll leave you guys with a super kawaii selfie I took last week when I had the energy to do my eyeliner LOL!! much love.'

She also attributed her recovery to her loved ones and supporters.

'I would not be recovering as fast as
I am if wasn't for all the love surrounding me on a daily basis. How 
awesome my fundraiser is doing, the support of the industry, random 
strangers from all over the world sending me good vibes,' she wrote.

Gaming websites like Segmentnext.com 
are also advertising the girl's fundraising site to speed along her 
recovery process.

Ana may have lost her leg but she didn't lose her ability to have fun and look fabulous

'3 things. Hospital rooms have great lighting for selfies. My makeup is on point today (hey, it's friday yall) and I get out monday!! yay. I'd do a little dance but I'm super sore from therapy, and my balance isn't THAT good just yet,' she wrote. 

On the first day she was able to wear her own clothing as oppose to hospital garb she chose a shirt featuring Insomniac Games characters. She even threw some gaming lingo into her facebook posts. On November 22nd she wrote, 'And incase anyone was wondering...here's "proof" that my right leg did indeed get KO'ed, aaaand I still got that swag' 

Doing better: These photos--taken just days apart--show how quickly Ana is recovering

On November 25th she wrote, 'feels good to be home.'

Ana is getting better by the day. Her 
recent facebook posting show cheeky photos of her experimenting with 
make-up and keeping her spirits high.

Friends and strangers around the globe shared their well wishes and hoped that she would get well soon.

'Ana! I heard about your brave recovery recently on my feed. I'm so happy to see the game industry come together to support a fellow developer! I am always here on FB if you need any support with your game dev endeavors. I can't wait to see what the future has in store for you and the great work you'll develop!,' her friend Jeff Alan Greenbeck posted on her wall. 'Stay strong you are never given anything you can not handle. Get mad,Get even, Get happy just do not give up you are stronger then you know everyone is you just have to be tested,' wrote her freind Ed Boyd.

Kessel is a recent graduate of Full Sail University. She was on her way to becoming a professional artist.

 'Although, given that Full Sail is a very expensive school to go to she will be having many financial issues with medical bills and college loans. I as well as all her friends and family are wishing for a full recovery and hopeful future using her talented skills with as little complications as possible,' said a posting on the fundraising website.
