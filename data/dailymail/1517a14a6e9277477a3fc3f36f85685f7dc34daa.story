Kane died after choking on a sweet in front of his terrified family

A boy of ten who choked on a gobstopper died because an ambulance crew couldn’t  pinpoint his house on their satellite navigation system.

Kane Wade was playing in his garden when the sweet became lodged in his windpipe.

His parents dialled 999 and, with Kane’s 13-year-old sister watching on, desperately tried to clear the youngster’s throat while they waited for help to arrive.

Despite arriving in the road within eight minutes, paramedics couldn’t find the family home on the in-built satnav and lost several vital minutes.

Eventually, the ambulance crew found the address but by then Kane had turned blue and stopped breathing.

Paramedics spent 20 minutes trying to revive him but, although they managed to restart his heart, he was pronounced dead in hospital several hours later.

Last night it emerged that although the road where Kane lived, in Norris Green, Liverpool, was built in 2007, his house had been completed only three months before last June’s tragedy.

This meant it was not on the North West Ambulance Service’s satnav system, which is updated annually each September.

Kane’s mother, Lindsey Wade, 38, and father, Barry Ismail, 52, a nightclub entertainer, are now taking legal action against NWAS for failing their son, who was autistic and was unable to speak.

Miss Wade, who has three other children with Mr Ismail – Nadine, 20, Olivia, 13, and one-year-old Romy – said yesterday:

‘We were relying on that ambulance. The woman on the phone kept saying “It should be with you”, but there was no sign.

‘We’ve had no other problems. We get post, takeaways, everything – but not an ambulance to save my little boy’s life.’

Anger: Lindsey Wade and Barry Ismail by their street sign. The Ambulance Service couldn't find their home on their computer, despite the address being in the A-Z

Sources at NWAS said a fast-response paramedic and ambulance crew were dispatched at 6.39pm on June 26 last year and arrived at Pennycress Drive, where the family lived, at 6.47pm and 6.48pm respectively.

Despite there being just 44 houses in the street, paramedics could not find the home, which is at the far end of a cul-de-sac, until 6.52pm.

The delay meant the ambulance missed the target response time of eight minutes by five minutes.

Miss Wade said: ‘So many new estates are being built all the time – is the ambulance service saying this risk is there for all those houses across the country?’

She said children playing in the street later reported the ambulance crew parked on a nearby road for several minutes beforehand.

‘They could have asked the children where our street was, but instead they just sat there and let Kane die,’ Miss Wade said.

The family’s MP, Stephen Twigg, said he would be contacting Health Secretary Andrew Lansley to highlight the problem.

‘Everybody loved Kane, he was such an amazing boy,’ said Miss Wade.

‘He was autistic and could not speak, but he had such personality.

‘My daughters are distraught. It was terrible for Olivia, who he was so close to. She is 13 and watched her brother die in front of her. I’m afraid it’s a trauma that she will never get over.’

An inquest in June last year gave a verdict of accidental death.

A spokesman for NWAS said: ‘We offer our sincere condolences to the family for their tragic loss.‘We have investigated this incident fully and shared the findings with representatives of the family.’
