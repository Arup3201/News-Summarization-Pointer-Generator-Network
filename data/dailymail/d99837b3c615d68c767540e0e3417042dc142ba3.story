A self-described 'horny' widow was arrested on Friday after she placed a fake 911 call then propositioned the responding officer for sex.

Maria Montanez-Colon, 58, allegedly aggressively fondled the officer and told him: 'I haven't been penetrated in years.'

Mrs Montanez-Colon, who claimed that her late husband was an NYPD officer, said she called police to her Florida home after a family row over a Corvette which belonged to her late husband.

According to a police report from The Smoking Gun, Punta Gorda Police Department officer Justin Davoult was told by the inebriated 58-year-old: 'You are so sexy.'

In the report Davoult, 31, stated: 'I asked her what I could help her with and she stated: ''You can f*** me.'''

Officer Davoult said the woman tried to rub his chest and grab his arm.

After the police officer left the home, the woman dialed 911 again and said that the officer had 'p***** her off'. Officer Davoult responded once again to the home with a police lieutenant as back-up.

According to the report, Montanez-Colon told the officers that Davoult 'had been a perfect gentleman but when I asked him to f*** me, he turned me down so that made me angry'.

When the officers asked the woman if she understood that she had misused the emergency call system, she answered: 'I do, but how else am I going to get you to f*** me?'

The 58-year-old was arrested for misuse of 911 and booked into the Charlotte County Jail where she remains.
