A woman sobbed as she was jailed for four years yesterday for torching a block of flats in an arson attack that left a 76-year-old woman homeless and needing hospital treatment for a week.

Kelly Howell was 'drunk and giggling' as she piled up rubbish outside a friend's flat in Stockport, Greater Manchester, before setting it alight following a row, a court heard yesterday.

The blaze took hold of the front door,
filling the upstairs and downstairs flats with smoke, and trapping two friends and elderly neighbour Patricia Blackburne inside and fearing for their lives.

Jailed: Kelly Howell was 'drunk and giggling' as she piled up rubbish outside a friend's flat in Stockport, Greater Manchester before setting it alight following a row, a court heard yesterday

At a hearing at Minshull Street Crown in Manchester, the jury was told the three petrified residents thought they were going to die, and the entire row of 10 homes could have been engulfed if firefighters had not arrived when they did.

Mrs Blackburne, a resident of 22 years, was rescued by firefighters and rushed to hospital for smoke inhalation, where she remained for a week.

When she was released, she had to move into a care home for two months because her home had been so badly damaged.

Jobless Howell's senseless attack in January also caused £60,000-worth of damage. 

Prosecuting the 26-year-old, who is from Stockport in Greater Manchester, Lisa Boocock told the court how Mrs Blackburne was woken at 1.30am by her fire alarm in her downstairs flat.

'The lights went out in the flat and it was filling with
smoke,' she said.

'She saw flames at the door. Her door was forced and firefighters
came into her house and took her outside.'

Howell's friend's were trapped in the upstairs flat and considered jumping from the window to escape the blaze, added Miss Boocock.

Howell was arrested a 
short time later, but told police she had nothing to do with the fire. 
But when she was quizzed she later confessed to her crime.

The
court heard she had hatched her plan after drinking with her two 
friends. When they had rowed, Howell was thrown out and told not to come
back.

Reckless: Howell was sentenced yesterday at a hearing at Minshull Crown Court in Manchester

That was when she decided to torch the place as a 'prank'.

Howell pleaded guilty to causing arson reckless as to whether life was endangered.

Defending, Michael
Knowles, defending, said: 'It was a small action on her 
behalf which resulted in serious consequences which she should have 
thought about but did not at the time.'

Mr Knowles argued that any jail sentence could be suspended and that Howell could serve her punishment in the community.

But Judge Adrian Smith told Howell: 'You placed the lives of three people at grave risk and you did this as a prank.

'You
are entirely culpable. You are entirely to blame for this offence. Such
serious conduct clearly calls for a substantial punishment as a 
deterrent to others.'

He 
added: 'I would fail completely in my public duty if I was to impose a 
sentence which could be suspended, or even to think of a suspended 
sentence.'

As her 
four-year sentence was read out, she turned to her family in the public 
gallery and asked 'Dad?'

Geoff
Harris, head of protection for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue 
Service said: 'In the last year, our work in partnership with Greater 
Manchester Police has resulted in the successful prosecution of more 
than 100 arsonists in Greater Manchester and we hope this latest 
sentence will act as a strong deterrent to those who deliberately put 
lives and property at risk in this way.'
