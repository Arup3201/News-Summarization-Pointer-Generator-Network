A five-year-old boy has been accused of deliberately starting a fire in a Pennsylvania house on Sunday night that killed his young cousin.

The victim of the fire, two-year-old Ayanna Lisa Brooks, died of smoke inhalation as she tried to hide from the flames that quickly engulfed the McKeesport home she lived in.

Her cousin, who has a history of starting fires, is believed to have used a lighter to start the blaze which destroyed three homes, and seriously damaged a fourth.

Inferno: The blaze quickly took hold in the rented house on Sunday night

Victim: Ayanna Lisa Brooks was found in an upstairs bedroom, where police believe she was trying to hide

The cousins were living at the rented home, which was shared by their mothers and five children. At the time of the fire Ayanna's mother was in Florida with another child.

Three children were able to escape from the blaze at about 11.30pm on Sunday, but Ayanna was found trapped in an upstairs bedroom.

A medical examiner found that she had died from smoke inhalation.

'She didnâ€™t die in the fire. The child was probably hiding; we believe hiding from the fire,' Allegheny County district attorney Stephen Zappala told CBS Pittsburgh.

Her cousin later gave officers 'sufficient evidence' that he had started the fire on purpose.

Children under 10 cannot be charged with
 murder, but court proceedings could be used to
 possibly remove him from his family.

'This is arson,' Zappala said. 'This was not an accident. You light pieces of paper together, furniture starts to combust.

'Given the structure of the house and the construction of the house, it went up in a hurry.'

Zappala told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that the landlord, Steel City Realty Investments, may have violated a law requiring smoke detectors to be fitted in homes.

No smoke alarms were heard as the blaze ripped through the properties, and firefighters said the have not yet found any among the rubble of the buildings.

An investigation into the fire and any possible violations is ongoing. The rental company has not yet commented.
