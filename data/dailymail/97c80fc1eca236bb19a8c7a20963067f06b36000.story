A real-life Paddington bear who suffered such brutal treatment in a circus that she lost her claws, teeth and most of her fur is looking for a new home – with the support of the creator of her marmalade-loving fictional relative. 

The bear, called Cholita, was in a ‘deplorable condition’ when she was rescued from a circus  in Peru last week by London-based Animal Defenders International (ADI).

The group is now appealing for funds to fly her to a sanctuary in the United States.

Real-life Paddington: Cholita suffered such brutal treatment in a circus that she lost her claws, teeth and most of her fur

A heart-breaking video released by ADI shows the bear in a government zoo with barely any of her thick black body hair left, the result of stress she suffered at the circus

Horrific neglect: Animal Defenders International's raid near Piura in northern Peru last week was one of a number across South America

Like Paddington from ‘deepest, darkest Peru’, Cholita is a spectacled or Andean bear, an endangered species native to the region.

Last night Michael Bond, the author of the bestselling children’s books, gave his endorsement to the campaign to transport her to the US.

He said: ‘Bears, especially from Peru, obviously have a special place in my life.

‘It is such a horrendous story. I very much hope that, with the charity’s help, Cholita will get the care she needs to recover.’

The group said that she had been crammed in a box just 5ft by 5ft in the circus, while her fingers were cut down to stumps and her teeth deliberately shattered so she could not defend herself.

The organisation's president Jan Creamer said: ‘Her butchered paws, broken teeth and hairless body illustrate more than any words possibly can the terrible suffering poor Cholita endured in the circus.

‘She would have spent years there confined, likely chained, and forced to perform tricks for the audience.’

The group's raid near Piura in northern Peru last week was one of a number across South America.

It is now planning to get Cholita on to a flight taking 33 rescued circus lions from Peru to a new life in Colorado next month, the biggest airlift of its kind ever undertaken.

But it urgently needs hundreds of thousands of pounds to pay for the flight and provide Cholita with medical care.
