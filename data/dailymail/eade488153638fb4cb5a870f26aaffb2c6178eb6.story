Australian properties are rising higher in the housing market but a rise in interest rates could cause a downturn, according to new data.

The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index found capital cities dwelling values rised 4.2 per cent higher in June, July and August, recording Australia's strongest house price growth in winter since 2007.

Sydney and Melbourne were recorded as the strongest performing cities in all capital, where market values recorded a 5.0 per cent and 6.4 per cent lift.

The next best performing city was Canberra where values gain 2.5 per cent higher over the three months, according to data.

Adelaide home values rose 1.5 per cent and Brisbane recording a 1.3 per cent gain while Perth values up 1.0 per cent.

A modest drop in values over the winter months was seen across Darwin at -0.6 per cent and Hobart -0.8 per cent.

Market values are now 10.9 per cent higher over the past 12 months but Sydney and Melbourne were the only cities to double its growth over the past year.

RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne housing markets were the strongest performing cities during the 2009/2010 growth cycle.

'Over the latest growth cycle we have seen Sydney dwelling values increase by 27.2 per cent and Melbourne values up by 19.5 per cent,' he said.

The Templestowe home in Melbourne, Victoria is on the market from $950,000 - $1,050,000

'Since the beginning of 2009, we have seen values rise by a cumulative 50.1 per cent and 46.1 per cent respectively in Sydney and Melbourne.'

Darwin and Canberra recorded fairly strong growth at 29 per cent and 21.5 per cent. The next best performer was Perth where values are 15 per cent higher, followed by Adelaide at 9.9 per cent, Brisbane with 5.3 per cent but Hobart values dropped 1.5 per cent lower.

'With September marking the start of Spring, we are expecting listings numbers to rise over the coming month which will provide a real test for the housing market,' Mr Lawless said.

'Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates, a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it's likely that dwelling values rise even further over the next three months.

'Consumer confidence is also moving in the right direction now after the post-budget slump which will add fuel to the exuberant buying and selling conditions we have seen during winter.'

Despite the population increase of all capital cities, Senior research analyst Cameron Kusher told Property Observer that: 'we may see a slowdown in value growth across these cities.'

Mr Kusher said that a rise in interest rates could slow down the housing market in Sydney and Melbourne.

'With interest rates already at historic low levels and returns on safe investment classes so low, the maintenance of current interest rate settings is likely to continue to encourage investment in housing,' he said.

Property Observer reports the other option to decrease the house price growth would be macro prudential control, alike to that seen in the UK and New Zealand.

New Zealand have been introduced to limitations allowing just 10 per cent of lending to mortgages of loan to value ratio (LVR) above 80%. The UK also brings in limitations to just 15 per cent of new mortgage lending going to mortgages 4.5 times the annual income of the lender in a mortgage, according to the Property Observer.

Mr Kusher said that given current median prices in Sydney and Melbourne, itâ€™s fair to say that 15 per cent of the mortgagee are borrowing above 4.5 times their annual income.

'With home values in Sydney and Melbourne continuing to march higher it seems as if only higher interest rates or the introduction of macro prudential tools can realistically stop the growth in home value,' he said.
