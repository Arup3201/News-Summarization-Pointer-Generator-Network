Malik Obama, the president's Kenyan half brother, was photographed in 2010 at a public event in Yemen wearing a 'keffiyeh' – a special scarf – bearing two anti-Israel slogans of the terror group Hamas, it emerged today.

'Jerusalem is ours – WE ARE COMING,' reads one saying. 'From the river to the sea,' says the other statement. 

That rallying cry refers to Palestinian militants' belief that the territory representing Israel, with the Jordan River to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, rightfully belongs to them – and Israel should not exist.

During a 2010 event in Yemen, President Obama's half-brother Malik wore this Hamas keffiyeh featuring the slogans 'Jerusalem is ours -- WE ARE COMING!' and 'From the River to the Sea'

The photo appears on the website
 of the Barack H. Obama Foundation, a group that Malik founded and 
manages, despite its lack of a connection with he U.S. president. The 
name in the organization's title refers to the president's father, the 
parent whom the two men share in common.

Malik
 Obama also serves as the executive secretary of the Islamic Da'wa 
Organization, a group created by the government of Sudan.

While the White House has sought to distance President Obama from Malik and his other relations, the Kenyan told GQ in July 2013 that the two speak regularly.

'Of course we’re close!' he said. 'I'm the one who brought him here to Kogelo in 1988! I thought it was important for him to come home and see from whence his family came – you know, his roots.'

Malik told MailOnline in March 2013 that his more famous half-brother is 'always at the end of a phone line if I want to talk. I last saw him on November 19 last year, shortly after the U.S. election. I went to the White House and offered him my congratulations'.

The Barack H. Obama foundation made news in 2013 after the IRS was accused of delaying the tax-exemption applications of tea party groups and other conservative organizations because of their political beliefs in 2010 and 2011.

But the Barack H. Obama Foundation saw its application approved in just 28 days. The final determination letter was signed by Lois Lerner, the former official forced to resign over the tea party scandal.

Malik is a practicing Muslim, but his embrace of militant Islam, including Hamas – a U.S.-designated terrorist organization – is curious because he has expressed a desire to run for president in Kenya, a predominantly Christian nation.

Malik Obama has been a visitor to his half-brother's Oval Office in the White House, and also appears to be a die-hard supporter of the Hamas terrorists

His first foray into politics ended badly when he was trounced in a regional governorship election in 2013, despite using a photograph of him and President Barack Obama in the Oval Office as his political calling card.

But Malik Obama's connection to Hamas may not be the most colorful thing about him. The president's half-bother has had at least 12 wives and was accused of beating two of them.

The 55-year-old's most recent spouse is a 19-year-old girl who quit her education to be with him, over her family's strenuous objections.

Polygamy is legal in Kenya if it fits within a person's religious or cultural traditions.

'She decided she doesn't want to go back to school. She wants to get married now,' Malik said during a TV broadcast in 2010. 'She came here, and what am I supposed to do? So we are married.'

The photo of Malik Obama wearing the Hamas scarf first appeared online on a blog run by Walid Shoebat, a former Muslim Brotherhood member who now calls himself a peace activist.
