A woman scorned: LaShonda Matlock wrote an angry open letter to her father, preacher Bill Adkins, telling him to 'go to hell'

The ignored daughter of a well-known Memphis preacher has written a scathing open letter to her estranged father detailing his abandonment and telling him to 'Go to hell'.

Titled ‘Letter to My Father Bill Adkins: Go to Hell,’ La Shonda Matlock’s open letter Wednesday called her estranged father’s faith, manhood and moral character into question while detailing his cruel ignorance of her existence for decades.

Mr Adkins is the founder and pastor of Greater Imani Church. 

‘There are times in life when you need to speak up, voice an opinion or just let it all out,’ Ms Matlock, 33, wrote to begin the letter. ‘This is one of those moments.’

The self-proclaimed ‘illegitimate daughter of married pastor Bill Adkins’ claims that despite growing up only five blocks from his church, he never visited her and even sent a cease and desist order demanding she stop trying to contact him - when she was only six-years-old.

Mr Adkins even visited her elementary school when she was eight-years-old, only to ignore her, she claims. By age 10, Ms Matlock felt lost.

‘I was a figment of my own imagination. I didn't exist, my last name was a lie and all records of me were buried in a black hole,’ she wrote.

Crediting her ‘wonderful mother and extended family’ for helping her deal with growing up without a father, Ms Matlock said she ‘never wanted of went without anything,’ even designer heels – but still she felt empty.

‘I had a good childhood, but the lies kept piling upon one after another,’ Ms Matlock wrote. ‘As I grew older into my teens my face became the exact image of a man I never knew.’

‘Rumors spread and I became a topic at dinner parties and for bored housewives,’ Ms Matlock continued. ‘I never wanted the attention, only to… have a dad like everyone else and like any child to have a father's love.’

Explaining that she ran into the preacher only four years ago, Ms Matlock made an attempt to talk to him, only to be derailed by a gun-toting security guard – who reached for his gun as she approached him.

‘I forgive you,’ I shouted. He nodded. That was my only acknowledgement I have ever received,’ Ms matlock writes of how the encounter ended.

Mr Adkins continued denial of Ms Matlock’s existence caused her to disavow tenets of the Christian faith calling for forgiveness.

‘Am I bitter, yes. A man of the cloth preaching to his flock how to live and walk the path of God yet having several children outside of marriage and never righting his wrongs is despicable to me,’ Ms Matlock continued, asking how Mr Adkins lives with himself.

Explaining that she’s given up trying to connect with Mr Adkins, Ms Matlock finished the letter with a final parting shot.

‘So to a man, who is a stranger and yet my father, I say "Go to hell."  But, you're already there, aren't you?’

Just blocks away: Mr Adkins' Greater Imani Church was only five blocks from the house his estranged daughter grew up in

The letter clearly got through to Mr Adkins, as he addressed it publicly and claims he sent his daughter an email.

Denying Ms Matlock was conceived in an affair, Mr Adkins told WATN he’s ‘sad to have seen the letter. I'm sorry she is enduring such hurt, suffering, and pain.’

Further trying to explain himself, the preacher said he was neither a man of god, nor married, when Ms Matlock was conceived.

First of all, I was not married. She’s 33 years old and that was 1979. I was not married. I was not a pastor of a church. I was a Radio Announcer at WLOK Radio,’ he told the station.

He offered to introduce his daughter to his family and the rest of the congregation at Sunday, but, in a reply to the station, she suggested family counseling first.
