A five-year-old managed to start an electric car then crashed into a baby in a buggy at a shopping centre in China.

The mischievous boy got into the new white Model S Tesla on display and started the ignition at the mall in Beijing, The People's Daily reports.

The car moved forward six metres and crashed straight into a red pushchair with a young child inside. The stroller fell over and the youngster, who was grabbed by its mother, was fortunately unhurt.

Eyewitness Lok Cheng, 36, told local TV: 'There were loads of kids messing around with the cars, even though it was in a roped off area. 

'The car started up but only moved forward at a slow speed, and the woman didn't realise because she had her back to it and the engine made no sound.

'They moved the car back afterwards but you could still see kids playing with it, so I don't think they treated the problem that seriously. At least not until the police turned up.'

The car was in the middle of the shopping centre in the Chinese capital as part of an exhibition featuring two of the new cars which were on display to the public.

The sales team were explaining some of the finer points of the car when the boy opened the door of the white Tesla and climbed inside apparently planning to pretend to drive it.

At rest: The white Model S can be seen lying in front of the exhibition. Crowds gather to look at the scene

Somehow he managed to start the car up and drove it forward, knocking down the woman and the child she had inside the buggy.

It has earned him the nickname 'bear child' in China which is a local expression for children who are left to run amok.   

The mother and baby were left shaken but unharmed and the family have now filed a complaint with the police. 

The authorities are investigating why the cars were not locked, allowing the child to get in.

Cordoned off: Where the new car should be, behind a tape barrier, at the Tongzhou Wanda Plaza Mall in Beijing

No action will be taken against the young driver but organisers of the exhibit and the shopping centre management at Tongzhou Wanda Plaza Mall could face censure for not taking more care.

Neither the management or the car showroom organisers commented on Sunday's incident.
