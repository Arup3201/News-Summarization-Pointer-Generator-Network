Controversial conservative Sarah Palin has launched her own subscription-based online network in order to 'stay in contact' with her supporters.

And it only costs them $99.95 a year.

The Sarah Palin Channel, which went live on Sunday, bills itself as a 'direct connection' for the former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential candidate with her supporters, bypassing 'media filters'.

Palin says she oversees all content posted to the channel. This will include her own political commentary.

'Tired of media filters? Well, so am I!' the former Alaska governor says on the first video posted to sarahpalinchannel.com.

'(I want to) cut through the media’s politically correct filter.'

There's also a family blog by her daughter Bristol, and clocks on both the national debt and how long the Obama administration has left in Palin.
