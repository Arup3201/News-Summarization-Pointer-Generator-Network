Arsenal will intensify their search for a new centre-back as captain Thomas Vermaelen ponders his future this summer.

New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal wants to sign the Belgium international as he looks to put his stamp on the Old Trafford squad.

Van Gaal is confident he can lure the central defender away from the Emirates Stadium ahead of next season.

Pondering: Thomas Vermaelen is considering his future away from Arsenal

Partners: He has been left frustrated after being kept out of the team by Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker

Vermaelen grew increasingly frustrated at his role at Arsenal last season as he played second fiddle to first choice central defensive pairing Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny.

But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is unwilling to let his skipper leave the club without having a replacement lined up.

Having already lost right-back Bacary Sagna, who was the club's fourth choice centre-back, to Manchester City, the Gunners boss does not want to leave himself short of cover in the position.

On tour: Vermaelen is currently away with Belgium at the World Cup

Vermaelen has a year left on his current Arsenal contract, meaning he can leave the club for nothing next summer - a scenario the Gunners are keen to avoid.

The Gunners are ready to offer Vermaelen a new contract this summer, but without the guarantee of increased first-team opportunities next season, the Belgian is likely to be reluctant to sign.

Cardiff defender Steven Caulker is being considered by Wenger, while Manchester City right-back Micah Richards, who can also play centre-back, could also be an option.
