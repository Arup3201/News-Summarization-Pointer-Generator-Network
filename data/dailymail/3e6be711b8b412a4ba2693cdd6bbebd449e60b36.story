The former child model who accused several Hollywood figures of sexually abusing him, including X-Men director Bryan Singer, can dismiss his lawsuit, but he has the option to re-file it later, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.

Michael Egan III said in a previous court filing that he wanted to dismiss the lawsuit, not because it lacks merit, but because he can't find a new lawyer to represent him.

Egan's last lawyer, Jeff Herman, left him when he backed out of a $100K settlement from Singer at the eleventh hour last month.

Singer sought to have the case dismissed with prejudice so it could not be re-filed, but his request was denied.

U.S. District Judge Susan Oki Mollway said Singer didn't prove that Egan's voluntary dismissal would damage the director's reputation, and that the money spent defending himself doesn't constitute legal prejudice.

'Any alleged damage to defendant's reputation may well be ameliorated by plaintiff's voluntary dismissal of the action,' she said. 

TMZ had reported last month that Singer's  settlement payment would be far less than he would spend in legal fees defending against the claims and would be viewed as a nuisance payment.

In his initial suit, Egan claimed he began being sexually abused when he was 14 or 15 and moved to Los Angeles with his family to start his acting career.

It was in LA that he was introduced to Hollywood powerplayer Marc Collins-Rector and his lover Chad Shackley when he was invited to a party at Collins-Rector's home.

These parties allegedly 'featured sexual contact between adult males and the many teenage boys,' according to Egan, but he maintains he 'never freely' consented to the advances.

It was two or three months after Collins-Rector began allegedly abusing Egan that he was introduced to Singer at one of the parties.

Former network TV executive Garth Ancier, who was named in Egan's lawsuit, is seeking punitive damages after he claims he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars defending himself against Egan's claims

Egan said he was in the pool, and nude, when Collins-Rector approached him and ordered him out to hug Singer, who allegedly grabbed his bare buttocks.  

He claims Singer later said he was 'sexy' and went on to masturbate the underage boy and perform oral sex on him. The director then told Egan to do the same to him, but he says he resisted.

Singer has denied these allegations. 

Egan previously dropped three similar lawsuits against other entertainment figures, including former network TV executive Garth Ancier, who is currently seeking punitive damages after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars defending himself against Egan's claims. 

The lawsuits were filed under an unusual state law in Hawaii that created a window for civil cases in sex-abuse cases when the statute of limitations has passed. 

Singer's attorneys couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

An attorney who Egan has said is advising him, but is not legally representing him, didn't immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
