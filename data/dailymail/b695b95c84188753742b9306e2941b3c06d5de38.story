Worry: Two in three women are concerned about the rising cost of living

Women are carrying the heaviest burden of ‘recession stress’, a survey has revealed.

Two in three – 66 per cent – are concerned about the rising cost of living, compared with 56 per cent of men.

At the same time, 55 per cent are more stressed about work and money than before the economic downturn began in 2008, compared with 42 per cent of men.

The concerns spread beyond the day-to-day battle about how to put food on the table and make sure the bills are paid.

The study found that 43 per cent of mothers are worried about what the crisis means for the prospects of their children, compared with just 33 per cent of fathers.

The figures come from the Future Of Britain study, published today. It identified that the real ‘squeezed middle’ are those aged 35-54. ‘

With mortgages and children, more of this age group say they are struggling with bills than younger or older groups,’ it said.

With women taking the lead role in seeing their families through the crisis, two in three are saving money by switching to cheaper supermarket own-label products, versus 57 per cent of men.

Meanwhile 41 per cent of women have turned to websites such as eBay to sell possessions in order to pay bills compared with 34 per cent of men.

Women are also saving more  and making cutbacks by eating out less frequently and postponing home improvements.

But the study also concludes  that the downturn has caused profound changes in family choices, with one in 20 saying  the lack of money means they have put off having children, while 3 per cent have delayed getting divorced or lived with someone longer than they wanted to.

Ten per cent have stayed in a job they do not like, and more than one in four are working more hours or have also taken a part-time post.

However, a lack of money can have some positive effects on health – one in five smokers have quit or are lighting up less, while one in three have cut down on alcohol or given up completely.
