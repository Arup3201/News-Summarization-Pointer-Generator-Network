Callum Robinson scored his first-ever career hat-trick as Preston North End eased into the second round of the FA Cup with a 3-0 victory against nine-man Havant and Waterlooville.

The on-loan Aston Villa teenager scored twice in the first half and added a penalty with 10 minutes remaining as the visitors returned to winning ways against a non-League Havant side that saw Brian Stock and Warren Cummings sent off.

The game was just seven minutes old when Robinson burst down the left and drilled past Havant goalkeeper Ryan Young at his near post.

Robinson doubled his and Preston's tally on the half-hour mark when he volleyed in a pin-point Paul Gallagher cross.

Havant, 74 places below their League One opponents, almost clawed their way back into the game when Brian Dutton's header rebounded off a post.

But the non-Leaguers' night went from bad to worse after 58 minutes. 

Former Preston midfielder Stock was sent off after picking up a second yellow card for kicking out at Josh Brownhill.

Then, Preston were gifted a third goal nine minutes from time.

Havant were reduced to nine men after Cummings was shown a straight red for handling on the line and man-of-the-match Robinson tucked away the penalty to seal his side's victory.

Preston will face the winners of the Walsall against Shrewsbury replay at home in the next round.
