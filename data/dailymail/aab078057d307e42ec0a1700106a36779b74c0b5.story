Out of control: Professor Dame Sally Davies said the willingness of GPs to give out drugs was causing the spread of superbugs

Family doctors are fuelling the spread of superbugs by needlessly ‘dishing out’ antibiotics, the country’s top medical adviser has said.

Professor Dame Sally Davies accused GPs of prescribing powerful drugs to patients who are reluctant to take time off work with minor illnesses.

She also called for sick animals to be slaughtered rather than treated to prevent a looming crisis in antibiotic resistance.

Dame Sally, the Chief Medical Officer for England, warned of a growing postcode lottery in which it is twice as easy to get an antibiotics prescription from a GP in Newcastle than in parts of London.

And she called for a 24-hour delay in prescriptions to stop people taking the drugs if they don’t need them.

Speaking at the Cambridge Science Festival, she said: ‘There is evidence that some GPs are dishing out more than they need to for medical clinical disease.

‘We’ve clearly got it wrong, and I would argue that GPs do need more training. If we don’t take action, deaths will go up and up and modern medicine as we know it will be lost.’

Antibiotics are designed to fight bacteria, but are routinely given for viral infections.

Experts are worried that high usage of antibiotics increases the chances of bacteria becoming resistant to them – fuelling a breed of superbugs such as MRSA and making illness more difficult to treat in the long term.

Last year Dame Sally asked the Government to put antibiotic resistance on the national risk register – ranking it alongside a large-scale terrorist attack or flu pandemic.

She warned that without action we may return to a ‘19th-century environment’ within 20 years, in which routine operations such as transplants carry a deadly risk because of the risk of untreatable infections.

About 35million antibiotic prescriptions are given out by doctors in England every year. The biggest prescribers are in western Newcastle, where one in 12 patients were given the medication in 2012.

That is twice as many as the lowest, in Camden, north London, where one in 25 received a prescription the same year.

Dame Sally said: ‘You can’t tell me that in Newcastle West they’ve got more sick people, more than double, than in Camden.

'So there’s something about prescribing practice.’ Statistics reveal a pronounced north-south divide in prescribing rates, with 69 per cent of northern areas prescribing more than the national average, compared with 39 per cent of those in the south.

'But the Government’s own research has shown antibiotics are prescribed for up to 80 per cent of such minor ailments – despite being more likely to be caused by a virus than a bacteria.

Dame Sally said: ‘It is very difficult for GPs. They get patients coming and saying, “I’ve got an ear infection”, or more often “my child has an infection”. They say, “Give me an antibiotic so I can go to work”.

‘I don’t beat GPs up because I think it’s very difficult when you’re faced with a mother who is very anxious with a sick child with a high temperature.’

She also called for a cut in the use of antibiotics in farm animals, one of the biggest causes of resistance to the drugs.

Controversially, she urged vets to slaughter sick animals rather than give them antibiotics to help them recover.

She said: ‘I had a bit of a problem with some vets recently because I said, “Why don’t you just slaughter animals when they’re badly infected?” It seems to me much better because then they can’t transmit them [antibiotics].

‘At the moment, if you eat a farmed salmon in America it has probably eaten its own weight in antibiotics.’

Dame Sally called for the adoption of a delayed prescription system for patients, to drive down use of drugs.

She said: ‘The doctor writes the prescription and hands it to the parents and says, “If your child is still sick in 24 hours and hasn’t improved, go and get your prescription.” ’

She also accused drugs companies of failing to invest in developing new antibiotics, because ‘they don’t make a profit’.

No new class of antibiotic has been discovered since 1987. In contrast, a new infection emerges on an almost yearly basis.

She added: ‘I’m really worried about this. This is like climate change. We are doing it to ourselves and we could die of it if we don’t do something now.’

Doctors
 have been advised not to give patients antibiotics for minor illnesses 
since 1998, but Government research suggests the drugs are prescribed 
for up to 80 per cent of coughs, colds and sore throats.Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria adapt to survive the medicines intended to destroy them.

Standard treatments become ineffective and infections persist, increasing  risk of spreading to others.

High
 doses of the drugs – whether for humans or animals – increase the 
problem by accelerating the speed at which bacteria adapt.

Resistance
 to the drugs has led to the rise of superbugs against which there is no
 treatment, such as MRSA and clostridium difficile.

Dame Sally warns that within 20 years it may be impossible to fight common infections, making routine operations dangerous.

But
 critics claim that so-called ‘antibiotic  prohibitionists’ such as Dame
 Sally are making it harder for patients to get the drugs they need.
