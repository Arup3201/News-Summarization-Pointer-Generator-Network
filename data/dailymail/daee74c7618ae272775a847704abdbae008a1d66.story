Louis van Gaal will tell his players face-to-face if they have no future at Manchester United after the club’s US tour to give them time to negotiate a move away from Old Trafford.

Anderson, Nani, Javier Hernandez, Shinji Kagawa and Marouane Fellaini are among the big names in danger of being jettisoned before the transfer deadline but, typically, Van Gaal will not shirk the responsibility of breaking the news.

‘I shall make judgements after this tour,’ he said. ‘I have let all the players play and I know now more than before the tour.

‘Now also it is a little bit soon to judge but in football you have to judge. You have to give the player a chance to make a transfer when I see that his prospects to play are not so high.

‘You have to say it in advance because it’s too late after August 31. I will tell payers after the tour but to them not to you.’

Van Gaal was speaking at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami ahead of the International Champions Cup final against old rivals Liverpool on Monday. Hernandez scored in the win against Real Madrid on Saturday that sent United through but it does not seem to have made much of an impression on his manager.

‘I think the striker has the biggest chance to score so that it is not the reason why a player plays,’ Van Gaal added. ‘We are playing like team and the team scores. I don’t make individual evaluations because we are playing with a team not individual players.’

Responding to comments by Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers that he will find the competitive nature of the Premier League very different to working at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich where the league is dominated by one or two clubs, Van Gaal replied: ‘That’s why I’m here. 

'OK, maybe he is right because I have to experience that but I was also in Spain and in my first year and I won three titles, in Germany I won two titles. If I win one here we will all be happy.

The United boss will try to give many of his players 90 minutes against Liverpool as they step up their preparations. He has not ruled out the possibility of Robin van Persie featuring in the first game of the season at home to Swansea even though the striker has made a late return to training with other World Cup players Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj.

‘They have already trained,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I sent them to train with a special group. They could reach the first match, not against Valencia (in a friendly). That depends on the individual because each one is different.

‘You have seen on this tour for example that Ashley Young already played 90 minutes and Darren Fletcher two matches of 90 minutes but not others. There is a difference between players and I have to see if they can do it or not.

‘I have to look at Robin van Persie if he is coming back or it. But if you have three weeks holiday and only four days training before Valencia you are not fit enough. For the first game in the Premier League it’s possible but I don’t think so.’
