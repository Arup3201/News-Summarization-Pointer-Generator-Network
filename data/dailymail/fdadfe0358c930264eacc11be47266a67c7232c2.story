NHS consultants should work on weekends because it is ‘wrong’ for patients to be at greater risk on Saturdays and Sundays, a report has said.

The Academy of Royal Colleges says drastic changes should be made to the running of hospitals so that senior staff, emergency tests and urgent surgery are quickly accessible each day.

It suggests that patients should be checked by consultants daily because it is ‘ethically unjustifiable’ that patients should face greater risks on public holidays and weekends - when less experienced staff take over.

NHS consultants should work on weekends because it is 'wrong' for patients to be at greater risk on Saturdays and Sundays, a report has said

‘It is wrong that a patient in hospital can suffer more because their stay includes a weekend and/or a bank holiday,’ the report said.

At present junior doctors are expected to staff hospitals at weekends and to rely on consultants who are ‘on call’ for emergencies.

And some patients are currently made to wait up to four days to see a consultant because they do not work weekends, research from the 20 organisations which represent senior doctors showed.

But it is ‘ethically unjustifiable to provide a lower standard of care to patient at weekends than weekdays,’ the document stated.

As well as better access to consultants the colleges recommended that emergency surgery, diagnostic tests and results of those tests should be made more accessible on weekends.

Patients should expect laboratory services, X-ray, ultrasound and MRI scanning, emergency surgery, anaestheisa, physiotherapy, pharmacy and patient transport to work on a seven-day basis, the report said.

Research which emerged earlier this year showed that patients were 44 per cent more likely to die following planned surgery on a Friday than those who had the same operations on a Monday.

Other studies have found 16 per higher mortality among those admitted to hospital on Sundays, compared with patients who fall ill during the week.

Professor Norman Williams, Steering Group Chairman for the academy, and President of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ‘What we want to see is a health service that can truly meet the demands of the 21st century.

'It is not acceptable that over weekends and bank holidays, patients receive a lower standard of care than they would during the week.’

He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Using the findings of this report, we must work together to re-shape hospital services in a way that strengthens the quality of care given to patients regardless of when they are admitted.’

The report predicts that changes will increase NHS costs in the short-term, but that the improvements in care could reduce costs in the long run.

The colleges said hospitals will have to be centralised on fewer sites, to ensure there are enough specialists working in the right places.
