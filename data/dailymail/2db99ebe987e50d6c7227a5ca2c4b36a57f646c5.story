Passengers spoke of their shock after a 48-year-old woman and her son aged 10 died in a suspected murder suicide after being hit by a train in ‘suspicious circumstances’ at a packed station.

Travellers on the 8.41am Bedwyn 
to London Paddington commuter service yesterday described feeling a ‘big impact’ as their train came to a shuddering halt at Slough station in Berkshire.

The driver then apologised as he broke the news to passengers over the public address system that the train had hit  the pair, who were declared dead at the scene following the incident at 9.45am.

Commuters told how he repeatedly apologised over the loud speaker while awaiting 
instructions from his control room. Forensic investigators could later 
be seen working on the platform and track.

Sources
 said police were 'keeping an open mind' - but were not ruling out 'foul
 play' in the deaths, which happened after the woman and child allegedly jumped from one of the station's six platforms.

A British Transport Police (BTP) spokesman said: 'Our officers were called to Slough railway station shortly before 9.45am on Tuesday following reports that two people had been struck by a train.

'Thames Valley Police and South Central Ambulance Service also attended the incident, and a woman and child were pronounced dead at the scene.

'We have yet to formally identify the deceased however we can confirm we believe the woman was 48-years-old and the child, a boy, was 10. Both were local to the area.

'And we believe they were mother and son. The incident is still being treated as suspicious, though detectives do not believe there was any third party involvement at the station.

'Investigating officers are now appealing for anyone with information about the incident to come forward.'

Train operator First Great Western said 
Slough station - which is on its line about 20 miles west of London 
Paddington - had been shut and there was ‘no public access until further
 notice’.

Some passengers described on Twitter how they were
 told their train had become a ‘crime scene’.

'This has suddenly turned into a terrible morning. Train just hit someone at Slough. Feel for driver and, of course, family'

Ian Creamer, passenger

Ian
 Creamer from Newbury gave a running commentary, saying: 'This has 
suddenly turned into a terrible morning... Train just hit someone at 
Slough #FGW... Feel for driver and, of course, family.

‘Our train is now a "crime scene"... 
Never good to hear! Police, medical and FGW staff finally arrived… 
Police with evidence bags around the train...  And FGW staff with water 
on the train...

'Looks 
like on the move soon [sic]. Police now gathering names and phone 
numbers of everyone on the train - could be a while... We are on the 
move...'

Others on the train
 expressed their sympathy for the driver. Tommy Taylor said: ‘Poor 
driver. Hits two people and he's apologising to the passengers - screw 
us mate, I hope you're alright.’

Passengers told how the train was travelling at ‘quite a 
speed’ when it made an unscheduled stop.

Patrol: British Transport Police said officers were called to Slough train station shortly before 9.45am

Derek
 Darke, 62, had boarded the train at Theale, near Newbury, said: ‘The 
train brakes then came on and we ground to halt and we obviously knew 
that there had been an incident.

‘The
 driver did the best he could to explain what was happening and then the
 police arrived and told us that the train was a crime scene.’

Another
 passenger said: ‘I was in the middle carriage and everybody just looked
 at each other and said “what was that”? It was quite some time before 
we realised that it was a person.

'The driver is currently in shock and devastated about what has happened'

Sue Evans, First Great Western

‘And
 then to learn that it was a mother and child was just awful. The train 
driver was clearly very shocked, you could hear it in his voice, but he 
remained calm.’

The driver 
of the train which crashed had been left in a state of 'shock’ after the
 incident – and First Great Western insisted it would do its best to 
protect his welfare.

The train operator's director of 
communications Sue Evans said: ‘The driver is currently in shock and 
devastated about what has happened.

‘We
 do our best to protect our drivers in incidents like this and that 
involves keeping his identity secret, especially since the police are 
now involved.

‘We met 
him off the train and he is now being looked after in our chain of care.
 We are really sad about this incident - our job as a train operator is 
to make sure people get to where they need to go.

‘When an incident such as this happens we do our best to restore services as quickly as we can, which we are progressing well with.

‘We
 have people on the concourse to help passengers and look after them as 
much as possible, we met the passengers off the Slough train when it 
arrived in London.’

Meanwhile,
 train staff gathered outside the station, which was cordoned off by 
police tape. A taxi driver, who did not want to be named, was queuing 
outside the station when the deaths happened.

He
 said: ‘I heard the sirens and saw about four or five police cars arrive
 but we didn’t know it was this serious until the station was closed and
 everyone was forced to leave.

‘It’s
 terrible what has happened, we can’t believe it. A mother and child. 
We’ve heard a lot of different things but we don’t know what has really 
happened.’

Chief Inspector Jenny Gilmer ruled out
 the involvement of a third party in the incident, but said the deaths 
are still being treated as suspicious.

She
 said the possibility of a murder-suicide is ‘one of the lines of 
inquiry that our officers will be pursuing but we must not speculate’.

Officers combed the train tracks for evidence and studied the station's CCTV of the incident. A large number of witnesses both on the train and on the platform were also interviewed.

Closed: First Great Western said Slough train station had been shut and there was 'no public access'

The station reopened this afternoon after it was cordoned off for nearly six hours.

Officers
 have been searching the railway tracks and studying CCTV of the 
incident, as well as speaking to a large number of witnesses, both on 
the train and on the platform.

Chief Inspector Gilmer described the incident as ‘very upsetting and distressing for the driver and anyone who witnessed it’.

She said: ‘Officers were called to Slough railway station shortly before 9.45am following reports that two people had been struck by a train.

‘Thames Valley Police and South Central Ambulance also attended the incident and a woman and child were pronounced dead at the scene.

‘The incident is currently being treated as suspicious and our detectives have launched a full investigation.

‘But they do not believe there was any 
third-party involvement at the station. This is obviously a very tragic 
incident and our thoughts are very much with those affected.’

'The driver is incredibly shaken up by the incident and is being supported by ourselves and train operator First Great Western. He's going to have been traumatised by it.

'Witnesses were also very shaken up by what they saw and it was a traumatic incident for the officers who attended the scene.'

A South Central Ambulance Service 
spokesman said: ‘We were called at 9.42am to reports of two people 
struck by a train. We sent two ambulance officers and an ambulance crew 
and two people were confirmed deceased at the scene.’

Meanwhile, First Great Western later 
revealed that in a separate incident yesterday a person had been hit by a 
train almost 100 miles west on its line at Gloucester - but their 
condition was not known.

A spokesman said: 'Due to a person hit by a train at Gloucester, the station will be closed. No services will stop there and road transport is being arranged.'

Slough
 station, which is operated by First Great Western, has six platforms. 
Among the destinations to which passengers can travel directly are Reading, 
Oxford, Hereford, Great Malvern and London.

More than a century ago in June 1900, the station saw a major accident when an express train from London struck a local service that was at a standstill, killing five people and seriously injuring 35.
