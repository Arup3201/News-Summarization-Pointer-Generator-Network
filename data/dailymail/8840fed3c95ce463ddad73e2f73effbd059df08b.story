A college football quarterback shot in his throwing arm responded the way anyone else in his situation would – he took a hospital bed selfie.

Jonathan Flemming, 21, and a student at Houston Baptist University, was shot twice during an early Sunday morning carjacking outside a house party.

Flemming told KPRC he was forced out of the vehicle just before 2.00 a.m. and shot  – once each in the right shoulder and heel. He has since been released from a local hospital and is expected to recover.

Flemming’s famous shot was posted to Instagram in the hours after the bullet went through his important throwing shoulder, but that appeared to be the farthest from his concerns.

‘Only by God's grace did I survive,’ he told the station. 

The cocky snapshot shows the college gunslinger lying in bed with a blood-stained gauze wrapped around his right throwing shoulder.

It came only hours after a terrifying car theft that he thought might end his life.

‘I had a gun pointing in my face, so I opened the door, got out, put my hands up to surrender, to give them what they wanted, but they knocked me down, kicked me and punched me,’ said Flemming.

The 21-year-old quickly handed over his keys and wallet but the thugs still shot him twice, he said.

He was kneeling with his hands in the air when the shooter pumped two bullets into him, luckily the injuries were not life-threatening.

Flemming has already been discharged from the hospital and expect to be back on the practice field in a few weeks in time for the start of this coming season.

Police are still hunting for the suspects.
