Alastair Cook will lead England on their seven-match one-day international tour of Sri Lanka.

Cook's position as ODI, and therefore World Cup, captain has been the subject of much conjecture over the past two months - with critics citing his mediocre strike-rate at the top of the order as a significant concern.

But England's selectors have kept faith, naming him on Wednesday in a 16-man squad for the tour of Sri Lanka in November and December - meaning Cook can begin planning in earnest his team's World Cup campaign in Australia and New Zealand early next year.

National selector James Whitaker and his panel of head coach Peter Moores, Angus Fraser and Mick Newell met to agree the strategy for the winter and decided to stick by the 29-year-old – even though England have lost five One Day series while he has been in charge.

Pundits like Geoff Boycott, Michael Vaughan and Graeme Swann have all demanded change and pointed out Cook’s poor form in ODIs – he hasn’t made 80 in a 50-over match in more than two years.

But they decided that with Eoin Morgan and Joe Root the only possible alternatives there was nothing to be gained by dumping the skipper.
