A deranged homeless man has admitted to pushing a student in front of a commuter train in the New York City suburbs last year.

Howard Mickens, 40, pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted murder in Westchester County District Court on Tuesday, and will be sentenced next month. 

The South Carolina native was arrested on September 25, 2013, when he pushed Hunter College student Maya Leggat, then 21, onto the train tracks at the White Plains Metro-North train station. 

Justice: The homeless man who pushed Maya Leggat (pictured) onto commuter rail train tracks last year, pleaded guilty to attempted murder in court on Tuesday

Guilty: Howard Mickens, 40,  admitted to shoving the Hunter College student on to the tracks at this station north of New York City on September 25, 2013 

The English major was waiting to catch a train into the city for class when she looked up from her e-book reader to see a man staring at her. 

She looked back down as a train was coming into the station and just moments later felt the stranger grab her by the waist and shove her onto the tracks. 

Leggat survived the incident, but she suffered a broken back, two broken legs and a severed finger in the random attack.

Mickens, who was living in a homeless center in Valhalla, is expected to be sentenced to the maximum of 25 years in prison, five years probation and an order to stay away from Leggat at his next hearing on January 20. 

In court on Tuesday, Mickens admitted he pushed Leggat on the tracks and that it was an unprovoked attack. Leggat was not present in the courtroom to hear Mickens' admission.

He remained calm and quietly answered questions from Judge Barbara Zambelli and Assistant District Attorney Timothy Ward. 

Mickens' behavior was a sea change from his first hearing last year, when he went on a rant in court, pleading he was 'guilty with an explanation' and that people were out to kill him. 

The judge ordered Mickens held for a psychiatric evaluation, and doctors said he was unfit to stand trial. However, psychiatric experts for the prosecution said he was responsible for his criminal actions. 

He is now taking medications including the drug Risperdal, which is prescribed to those  who suffer from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

'I think the medication has helped you a lot, Mr Mickens, to understand what is going on here today,' Judge Zambelli said.

Mickens has a lengthy criminal record dating back twenty years.  He has been incarcerated in state prison three times, for convictions on robbery, assault and drug possession charges, records show.
