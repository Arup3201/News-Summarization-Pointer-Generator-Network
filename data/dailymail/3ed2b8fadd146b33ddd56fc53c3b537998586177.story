Radamel Falcao is still interesting English clubs including Liverpool even though the player himself is hoping to join Real Madrid.

The Colombian striker, who last year joined French club Monaco for £50million from Atletico Madrid last year is understood to be dissatisfied in the French League and keen to move back to Madrid.

However, Real Madrid have already paid £90million to sign James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Keylor Navas this summer and now have to rein in their spending to ensure they comply with UEFA’s tough Financial Fair Play rules.

They are keen to take Falcao on a loan with a view to a permanent move next season but Monaco will not let the striker go on those terms, as they believe Real should pay up front.

However, Monaco are prepared to loan him out for a season to another club and should Real not make a formal bid for him in the next two weeks before the window closes the player would consider a one-year loan with the expectation of moving to Real Madrid next summer.

Brendan Rodgers has made it clear that signing one more striker is his priority before the end of the transfer window and is an admirer of Falcao.

Liverpool still think he is more likely to join Madrid but will monitor the situation to see if Falcao can be persuaded to join them if that move does not materialise.

It is understood that the financing of the move would not be a problem even though Falcao would need to be paid more than £200,000 a week. Monaco are asking for a £12million loan fee, though that would be negotiated down. Manchester City have also made inquiries about Falcao but not taken it further at present.

Liverpool are also monitoring Fiorentina’s goalkeeper Netto, with a move possible before the end of the month. The club want to bring in support and competition for Simon Mignolet having sold Pepe Reina to Bayern Munich and bolster their squad, with Brad Jones the current No.2.
