Liverpool's players were back in training on Thursday as they aim for their third consecutive Premier League win against Sunderland at Anfield.

Brendan Rodgers' side host the Black Cats on Saturday, four days after goals from Adam Lallana, Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson gave them three points away at Leicester.

Reds stars including the fit-again Mamadou Sakho and Rickie Lambert were among those to take part in Thursday morning's session at Melwood.

Dejan Lovren, who was dropped for the victories against Stoke and Nigel Pearson's side, appeared in good spirits as he enjoyed a laugh despite being out of favour.

The Croatian and Rodgers' first-team stars were also joined by a number of the club's youth players, with Jerome Sinclair, Lloyd Jones and Jordan Rossiter among those to get a chance to impress.

One player still missing from training is Mario Balotelli, who has missed Liverpool's last three Premier League games with a groin problem.

Speaking at his pre-match press conference, Rodgers said of Balotelli: 'He's working with the medical team on a daily basis. I trust the team of people here that look after the injuries. Hopefully he'll be available sooner rather than later.' 

Balotelli has been the subject of controversy this week after he appeared to delete an Instagram post which included an anti-Semitic message, something Rodgers wasn't interested in discussing.

'He's still very much a Liverpool player but he's injured at the moment and there's nothing more to add, ' said the former Swansea boss.

'He's not fit to play and my concentration is on players who are fit and available to play and that's my only thinking at the moment.'

There was better news on the fitness on Philippe Coutinho and Jose Enrique, who should both be available for the visit of Gus Poyet's men.

Rodgers added: 'Philippe Coutinho had a slight issue with his knee during the week but he should be OK for the weekend.

'Jose Enrique is back in. We are having to manage Jose and his games, but he has trained and should be available for the weekend. Everyone else, it is as it was.'
