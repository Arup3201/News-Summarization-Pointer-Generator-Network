Court documents from June 26 said Mandela 'is in a permanent vegetative state and is assisted in breathing by a life support machine'

Nelson Mandela is being kept alive by a breathing machine and faces 'impending death,' court documents reveal.

The former president's health is 'perilous,' according to documents filed in the court case that resulted in the remains of his three deceased children being reburied Thursday in their original graves.

Court documents from June 26 said: 'The anticipation of his impending death is based on real and substantial grounds,' the court filing said.

Mandela, who was hospitalized on June 8, remains in critical but stable condition, according to the office of President Jacob Zuma, who visited the anti-apartheid leader on Thursday.

The South African presidency has denied that Mandela is in a 'vegetative state', and reiterated former statements that the beloved former leader is in a critical, but stable condition.

The Presidency released a statement 'clarifying' Mandela's condition, Sky News reported.

They said: 'We confirm our earlier statement released ... after President Jacob Zuma visited Madiba in hospital.'

Mandela is under around-the-clock care of a team of nurses, the presidency said, hours after the sensational court reports were revealed.

The documents read: They say the condition of the country’s first black president is ‘perilous’. ‘The anticipation of his impending death is based on real and substantial grounds,’ they add.

Claims: Explosive allegations were made today by Nelson Mandela's grandson  Mandla Mandela who called a press conference to reveal what he claims are the reasons behind the family's squabbling

Removal: The coffin of one of Nelson Mandela's children is brought to a burial site at former South African President's compound in Qunu

Return: Following a court case which granted Mandela's family the right to relocate the remains to Qunu, the remains were returned

The legal papers relate to a bitter legal battle between rival family factions over where Mr Mandela should be buried.

After examining him last week, the 
doctors wrote: ‘He is in a permanent vegetative state and is assisted in
 breathing by a life support machine.’

Medically, this means he is unresponsive and in a state between coma and death.

‘He’s basically gone,’ said Charlene Smith, Mr Mandela’s authorised biographer.

The statements come as the remains of the 94-year-old's 
three deceased children were reburied at their original resting site 
following a court order to return them after Mandla moved the bodies.

It comes as the feud between Mandela's family descended into soap opera farce today when his grandson and heir Mandla accused relatives of adultery and milking the fame of the revered anti-apartheid leader.

In a news conference broadcast live on
 TV that stunned South Africans, Mandla confirmed rumours that his young
 son, Zanethemba, was in fact the child of an illicit liaison between 
his brother Mbuso and Mandla's now ex-wife Anais Grimaud.

With Mandela on life-support in a 
Pretoria hospital, the escalating feud has transfixed and appalled South
 Africa in equal measure.

'Mbuso impregnated my wife,' Mandla 
said in Mvezo, the Eastern Cape village 700 km (450 miles) south of 
Johannesburg where Mandela was 
born and where Mandla serves as the formal chief of the clan.

Mandla, 39, first raised questions 
about his son's paternity last year when he split from French-speaking 
Grimaud, who has since moved back home to the Indian Ocean island of 
Reunion. He also revealed then that he was unable to have children.

His attempts to get the family to 
address the questions of Zanethemba's paternity had been rebuffed in the
 interests of preserving a semblance of unity in South Africa's most 
famous family, Mandla said.

'This matter has never been discussed 
by the so-called members of the family who say that they want to ensure 
there is harmony in this family,' he said, challenging reporters to 
conduct DNA tests to confirm his allegations.

'The facts are there. You may go and 
find out, do the necessary tests that are needed,' he said. His brother 
Mbuso has denied being the father of the child.

Newspapers have plastered 'Mandela vs.
 Mandela' headlines across their front pages and editorials have 
bemoaned the cruel irony of bitter divisions inside the family of a man 
lauded the world over as the epitome of reconciliation between races.

The government said that Mandela remained 'critical but stable' after nearly four weeks in hospital.

The sleepy community of Mvezo, set 
amid the rolling hills of the Eastern Cape, has been at the centre of a 
vicious dispute that may ultimately determine where South Africa's first
 black president will be laid to rest.

Two years ago, Mandla exhumed the 
bodies of three of Mandela's children from Qunu, where Mandela grew up, 
and moved them the 20 km to Mvezo, where Mandla has built a visitor 
centre and a memorial centre dedicated to his grandfather.

Mandla said he moved the bodies based 
on his right as chief to decide the final resting place of family 
members, especially his father Makgatho who died of an AIDS-related 
illness in 2005.

'I hold the right to determine where 
he is buried. I am the chief of Mvezo, as a traditional leader and the 
head of the royal house of Mandela,' said Mandla, dressed in a black 
leather jacket and red shirt.

Despite his assertions, many of South 
Africa's 53 million people believe the exhumations were part of a 
deliberate plan to ensure Mandela was buried in Mvezo.

Last week, a rival faction of the 
family, led by Mandla's aunt Makaziwe and including Mbuso, won a court 
order for the bodies to be returned to Qunu - an edict carried out late 
on Wednesday after a last-minute legal bid by Mandla failed.

Speaking calmly and deliberately in 
front of a bank of cameras, Mandla lashed out at Makaziwe and members of
 the wider family, accusing them of trying to cash in on the legacy of 
one of the 20th century's most respected political figures.

'This is the very family that has 
taken their own father, their own grandfather, to court for his monies,'
 he said, referring to a long-running legal bid by Makaziwe to remove 
the guardians of a Mandela charitable trust.

'It seems like anyone and everyone can
 come and say 'I am a Mandela' and demand to be part of the 
decision-making in this family,' he said. 'Individuals have abandoned 
their own families and heritage and decided to jump on the Mandela 
wagon.'

Makaziwe has declined to comment on the graves dispute, telling reporters that it is a 'private family matter'.

The three Mandela children exhumed 
from Mvezo are an infant girl who died in 1948, a boy, Thembi, who died 
in a car crash in 1969, and Mandla's father, Makgatho. In all, Mandela 
fathered six children from his three marriages.

Today family members and community elders attended a ceremony on the Mandela property that included the singing of hymns.

The reburial took place in Qunu, Mandela's hometown and the place the former president has said he wants to be buried.

Forensic tests earlier confirmed the remains were those of Mandela's children.

The
 bitter family feud comes as Mandela remains in critical condition 
nearly a month after being hospitalized for a recurring lung infection.

A Mandela family court affidavit, obtained by the Mail and Guardian 
newspaper, said Mandela is on life support in the form of a breathing 
respirator.

Mandla Mandela - the oldest male Mandela heir and a tribal chief - told a news conference on Thursday that 'my grandfather like myself would be highly disappointed in what is unraveling.'

Meanwhile, Mandela's wife said the former president is sometimes uncomfortable but seldom in pain while being treated in a hospital.

Graca Machel spoke about her husband's condition at a fundraising drive for a children's hospital that will be named after the 94-year-old anti-apartheid leader.

'Whatever is the outcome of his stay in hospital, that will remain the second time where he offered his nation an opportunity to be united under the banner of our flag, under the banner of our constitution,' she said.

Mandela, who was hospitalized on June 8, remains in critical but stable condition, according to a statement today by President Jacob Zuma's office. Zuma visited Mandela Thursday, said the statement.

Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years during white racist rule and was freed in 1990 before being elected president in all-race elections. He won the Nobel Peace Prize along with former President F.W. de Klerk.
