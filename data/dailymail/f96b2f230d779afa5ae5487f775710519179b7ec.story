EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso has admitted he is worried by the widening gap between Europe’s north and south.

The Portuguese head of the European Commission said during a visit to Austria today that countries which are doing well 'should show solidarity to the others’.

Bailing out the struggling countries has not been popular among the richer nations, including Britain.

Meanwhile, many in southern Europe resent the tough conditions imposed in exchange for aid. 

Barroso said that 'there is a widening gap between what we usually call the north and the south because of the crisis.'

He called it 'a serious matter of concern.'

His comments came as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said it is considering doing more to help the ailing eurozone economy. 

Draghi confirmed that an interest rate cut was discussed.

He also said the 23-member governing council was looking at 'various tools' that go beyond lower interest rates in case the economic recovery doesn’t turn out as expected. 

He held out the possibility that the central bank was looking at more measures to boost the economy. The bank, he said, was 'thinking 360 degrees' on new tactics. 

Yesterday the Bank of Japan announced a massive expansion of its efforts to increase the amount of money in the economy. 

Japan is struggling to overcome years of falling prices that have crippled growth.
