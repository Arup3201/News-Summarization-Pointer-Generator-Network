Wish you were here: Traditional cheeky postcards like the one pictured could become a less familiar sight thanks to the rise of social media

Traditional postcards are being written off by holidaymakers who now prefer to use social media to stay in touch with loved ones back home.

The rise of the smartphone means holidaymakers can tweet or text about their fun in the sun rather than putting pen to paper, with many dismissing postcards as 'too slow'.

Just one in six holidaymakers now send postcards to friends and family when they go abroad, new research shows.

Nearly half of the 2,000 people 
surveyed said they had never sent a postcard - preferring to text, call 
or use Facebook to keep in touch with home.

That
figure increases to more than half of young people aged under 24, many 
of whom take their social life abroad with them by posting envy-inducing
photos of their adventures online for the benefit of friends back home 
in Britain.

The research 
shows that, far from switching off when they leave their nine to five 
behind for a hard-earned holiday, many holidaymakers choose to keep in 
regular touch with home, with others continuing to use the internet to 
check the news as well as maps and guidebooks.

In all 46 per cent of those surveyed 
admitted to keeping in constant contact with friends and family at home 
when they go abroad.

Sending
text messages is the biggest cause of the decline of the postcard, with
more than half of people (60 per cent) surveyed using texts as a way to
keep friends and family updated.

Phoning home is the second most popular way to stay in touch, while a third of holidaymakers (34 per cent) use Facebook and 29 per cent choose to e-mail loved ones about their travels.

Almost four in 10 people surveyed dismissed postcards as too slow, while more than a third (36 per cent) felt that finding a stamp or a postbox was too difficult. Nearly one in 10 (8 per cent) were worried about the postman reading their holiday news.

O2 Travel, which carried out the 
research, predicts that 2012 will become a 'social summer', with UK 
travellers' mobile internet usage while on holiday doubling since last 
year.

It says sunseekers 
will continue to use Facebook and Twitter, access their e-mail and share
photos, all while soaking up the sun.

Sally
Cowdry, marketing and consumer director at O2, said: 'Smartphones allow
holiday makers the opportunity to take their social lives with them 
with the ability to keep up to date and instantly send personalised 
pictures and messages to friends and family.'
