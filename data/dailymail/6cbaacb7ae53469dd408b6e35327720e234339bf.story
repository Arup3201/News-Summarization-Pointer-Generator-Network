A mother-of-two lost nine stone after being told she was too fat to have surgery on her varicose veins. 

Tracy Cairns, 43, had the bulging veins all over her legs and was desperate to get them removed as they were so painful and unsightly. 

At over 19 stone, she also suffered several other health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

Tracy Cairns, 43, lost nine stone after doctors warned she was too fat to have surgery on her varicose veins. She is pictured three months after finally having the operation

Before the diet, she was over 19st and suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol

Her love of burgers, curry and huge pizzas loaded with cheese had left her with a BMI of 47 and a size 22.

However it wasn't until she was told by doctors that varicose vein surgery would be too risky that she decided to lose the weight.

Mrs Cairns, a full-time mother, said: 'At the time, I was probably oblivious to how big I was. 

'I hid behind baggy clothes and didn't make much of an effort with myself.

'The doctor said I needed an operation as the valves in my veins didn't work properly.

'But he said I would have to lose at least two stone before they could perform the operation.

'I was shocked. How could I let myself get so big that it was too risky for me to have an operation?

'I felt a deep sense of shame.'

Surgery is more risky for overweight and obese people. 

Research has shown that obese patients have a significantly higher risk of complications after surgery, such as heart attack, wound infection, nerve injury, and urinary tract infections. 

Being overweight also makes varicose veins worse as the extra weight puts more pressure on them.

This means they have to work harder to send the blood back to the heart. 

Mrs Cairns was also suffering from severe varicose veins all over her legs and was desperate to get them removed as they were so painful and unsightly

She says it was being told she was too overweight to have surgery that finally gave her a reason to lose weight

This can put increased pressure on the valves, making them more prone to leaking.

After being told the embarrassing news in July 2011, Mrs Cairns joined her local Slimming World group in Killingworth, North Tyneside.

In two years she lost 9st, dropping from a size 22 to a size 10.

She said: 'I realised I needed to do something to improve my health, so I joined Slimming World and started to going swimming and Zumba.

'Having the operation and getting my legs sorted was my goal.

'Instead of snacking on crisps and chocolates, I switched to fruit and yoghurts.'

She also learned to cook all her favourite meals by replacing some of the ingredients with low-fat alternatives. 

By the time she had reached the top of the NHS waiting list, she had lost an impressive 6st. 

Looking back, Mrs Cairns said she felt a 'deep sense of shame' over her size. She said: 'How could I let myself get so big that it was too risky for me to have an operation?'

Three months after her operation, she beared her legs for the first time while on the beach in Lanzarote on holiday. 

And three years on, she is now a size 10.

Mrs Cairns, who is married to Ali, 41, an IT consultant, said: 'Before I would have been hiding under my tent sized clothes, but now I feel slimmer and much happier.

'I am full of energy and play with my children all the time. I cycle with the kids and even jump on their scooter and walk to the park with them.

'It's also nice being able to go shopping and being able to pick anything off the rail.

'Looking back I am appalled that I allowed myself to get that big - and I'm glad the doctor told me I had to lose the weight. 

'I never thought I'd be grateful for varicose veins, but without them, I doubt I would have stuck to healthy eating.

'They have changed my life for the better.'
