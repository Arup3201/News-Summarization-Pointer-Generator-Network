Lorraine Bayless, an 87-year-old woman who was being cared for at the Glenwood Gardens retirement facility died after a nurse at the facility refused to perform CPR on her

This is the elderly woman who passed at her California retirement home after one of its nurses refused to give her CPR.

The 87-year-old woman, identified as Lorraine Bayless, collapsed in the dining room of the Bakersfield, California facility on Tuesday.

Though a nurse quickly called 911, she refused to give the woman CPR, citing it was against company policy. Ms Bayless was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.

'Is there anybody that's willing to help this lady and not let her die,' dispatcher Tracey Halvorson asked on a dramatic seven-minute 911 tape released by the Bakersfield Fire Department.

'Not at this time,' said the nurse, who didn't give her full name and said facility policy prevented her from giving the woman medical help.

It was later revealed that Ms Bayless 
had signed a Do Not Resuscitate form, and it is against the policy of 
the retirement home to give CPR to residents against their wishes.

The executive director at Glenwood, Jeffrey Toomer, said in a statement: ‘In the event of a health emergency at this independent living community, our practice is to immediately call emergency medical personnel for assistance and wait with the individual needing attention until such personnel arrives.

‘This is the protocol we followed,’ he said, adding that there would be an internal review of the incident

An 87-year-old woman identified as Lorraine Bayless collapsed in the dining facility of Glenwood Gardens in Bakersfield, California; an on-duty nurse refused to give her CPR

At the beginning of the Tuesday 
morning call, the nurse asked for paramedics to come and help the woman 
who had collapsed in the home's dining room and was barely breathing.

Halvorson
pleaded for the nurse to perform CPR, and after several refusals she 
starts asking her to find a resident, or a gardener, or anyone not
employed by the home to get on the phone, take her instructions and 
help the woman. 

NBC affiliate KGET reported that Ms Bayless, a resident of Glenwood Gardens’ independent living facility, collapsed in the dining room Tuesday morning.

The nurse on duty, who identified herself as Colleen, called 911 and was patched to the Bakersfield Fire Dispatcher.

The dispatcher begged for the nurse to give the woman CPR, even though it was against her wishes and against the retirement community policy.

Halvorson even requested the nurse to pass the phone to anyone else in the room – another senior citizen, or a gardener. The nurse refused, saying: ‘I can’t do that.’

The director for Glenwood Gardens said the woman had signed a DNR form, and that it was against policy to administer CPR in independent living facilities

Obviously frustrated, the dispatcher 
said: ‘I don’t understand why you’re not willing to help this patient… I
understand if your boss is telling you you can’t do it.

‘But…as a human being… you know…is there anybody that’s willing to help 
this lady and not let her die,’ Halvorson asked.

EMT workers arrived around seven minutes after the 911 call was placed and Ms Bayless was taken to Mercy Southwest Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

Her daughter, who is also a nurse, later told KGET that she was satisfied with the retirement home’s handling of the incident.
