The chief lawyer for Oscar Pistorius has said at his murder trial that a psychologist's report concluded the athlete is suffering severe trauma and will become an increasing suicide risk unless he continues to get mental health care. 

Defense lawyer Barry Roux on Wednesday read excerpts from the report, which was compiled during a 30-day observation period at a state psychiatric hospital.

A report was also compiled by three psychiatrists.

The evaluation concluded that the 
double-amputee runner was not mentally ill when he fatally shot 
girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a closed toilet door in the early 
hours of February 14, 2013. 

Pistorius says he shot Steenkamp by mistake, fearing there was a dangerous intruder in his home.

The prosecution alleges he killed her intentionally after a Valentine's Day argument.
