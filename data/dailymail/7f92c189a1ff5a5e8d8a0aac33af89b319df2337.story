A set of identical twins who happen to both be American astronauts will soon become subjects of a NASA experiment about the genetic-level effects of living in space.

Mark and Scott Kelly are genetically indiscernible from one another and researchers hope to use that biological fluke to their advantage by comparing the brothers’ bodies when one goes to space while the other stays behind on Earth.

The study is the first of its kind and will take place as Scott Kelly becomes the first American to spend an entire year living in space.

‘It’s not the kind of research that we in the human research program normally like to do,’ chief scientist John Charles told Discovery News. ‘[but] there may well be insights that can be gained that have not been investigated yet.’

NASA’s Human Research Program has previously investigated the interacts between and intersections of human physiology, technology, and the space environment, but research into possible effects of living in space at the genetic level is a new undertaking.

Researchers aren’t altogether sure what they’ll learn from the experiment, but say it could yield breakthroughs simply by virtue of its newness.

‘The way we wrote the proposal is essentially anything that researchers think is relevant to understanding the genomics,’ said Charles, ‘that can be deduced from a study of one astronaut in flight and one astronaut who is retired and not flying and living the good life in Albuquerque.’

Unprecedented: The brothers' unique situation makes them perfect subjects for such research as both Scott and Mark will be tested throughout Scott's year-long stint on the International Space Station in 2015

In 2015, Scott Kelly will begin his unprecedented stay aboard the International Space Station alongside Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko. Kelly will be the first American to spend a year in space, while five Russians have done so previously.

Meanwhile, Mark Kelly will remain firmly planted on Earth. The retired brother served as pilot or commander of multiple Endeavor space shuttle missions and may be even better known as husband to former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in Tuscon, Arizona in 2011.

Both brothers will submit blood and tissues to researchers for the year-long experiment. Scott’s sample will serve to determine what, if any, genetic changes occur during extended stays outside Earth.

New territory: Physiological impacts of space travel like those pictured have long been a focus of NASA's Human Research Project, but genetic changes have not been studied

Mark’s will serve as the control samples.

'This is sort of our first foray into the genetic aspects of spaceflight. This really is the wave of the future,' said Charles.

Kelly was among four astronauts on NASA's short list for the assignment. Each had served as a commander aboard the space station, and was able to perform spacewalks and robot arm operations. Medical information also went into the selection: A crew member could not have exceeded his limit for exposure to cosmic radiation, for instance.

Kelly said he has no idea how or why he ended up being chosen. He will set a U.S. space endurance record with this mission. No American has spent more than seven months in space at a time.

Cosmic radiation exposure and the possible increase of the likelihood of certain cancers is one known physiological danger of prolonged space flights.

The deterioration of weight-bearing bones and certain muscle groups is another effect commonly associated with astronauts and space travel.

Researchers hope this new type of experiment will help us better understand space travel’s less obvious effects so that they can prepare for the in the future.
