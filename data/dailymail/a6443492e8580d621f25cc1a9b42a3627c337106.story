It has been a trying start to the year for Gareth Bale at Real Madrid, with the crowd at the Santiago Bernabeu twice jeering him for his supposed selfishness on the pitch.

It appears the incidents, against Espanyol on January 10 and Real Sociedad on January 31, have impacted Bale's performances.

Statistics show that since the second time Bale was booed, he has shot at goal 12 times in 450 minutes in La Liga, which averages out as one attempt every 37.5 minutes.

Before that game, Bale  shot at goal every 22.9 minutes.

The Wales international first incurred the wrath of the Madrid faithful by not threading the ball into Cristiano Ronaldo to send him through on goal in the 3-0 victory over Espanyol.

Three weeks later, the whistles returned, despite Bale helping Madrid to a 4-1 win over David Moyes' side in the absence of Ronaldo, who was suspended.

The incident that aggravated a tempestuous Madrid crowd in that match was when Bale nipped in front of James Rodriguez to meet a Karim Benzema pass, only to skew his shot wide of the post with the goal gaping.

Bale's struggles with hitting the back of the net have continued since that game.

It is his longest scoring drought since he signed for Madrid from Tottenham in 2013.
