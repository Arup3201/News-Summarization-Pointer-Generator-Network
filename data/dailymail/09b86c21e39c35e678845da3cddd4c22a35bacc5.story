Taylor Armstrong had to undergo re-constructive surgery on her face after being beaten up by her estranged husband Russell just two months before he committed suicide, it has been claimed.

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star is pictured here, apparently four days before the 47-year-old businessman was found dead, sporting a cut above her left eye.

Friends close to the star claim she sustained this injury 'playing football' - and that Russell, who hanged himself, was not behind it.

However RadarOnline reports the 
40-year-old housewive was rushed to hospital in June following a violent
fight with Russell, who she filed for divorce from last month.

A source told the website: 'The damage to her face was so extensive that she spent days in the 
hospital and had to have a plastic surgeon give her re-constructive 
surgery to repair what Russell did to her.'

Taylor, who does charity work on behalf of domestic violence, has spoken out before about growing up in a violent family.

According to the insider, she wore 
heavy make-up to cover the extent of her injury and ensured their 
five-year-old daughter didn't find out Russell had allegedly hit her.

But her fellow housewives were said to
be aware of the incident and producers of the Bravo show had to 'film 
around her' for a while.

In an interview last month, Taylor 
claimed she had been verbally and physically abused by her estranged 
husband Russell during their six year marriage.

Taylor
filed for divorce, alleging in an interview with People 
magazine that she and Russell, often had 'explosive arguments' in which 
he would 'curse and call her names.'

The magazine reported that there were
times the 'arguments escalated into physical violence, which included 
grabbing her, throwing objects, shoving her and pulling her hair.'

Russell also acknowledged problems when questioned by the magazine.

'Did I push her? Yes, maybe things 
happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our 
lives that was not characteristic of who we were,' he said.

'This show 
has literally pushed us to the limit.'

The news comes amid reports that Russell's parents are said to be locked in a bitter dispute with Taylor about where he will be laid to rest.

The reality star,
who is understood to be making the arrangements for next week's 
funeral, wants him to be buried in a cemetery in the Los Angles area.

However
the businessman's lawyer, Ron Richards, says the parents want their 
son's body to be returned to their homeland of Texas for a cremation.

Taylor had been back in touch with 47-year-old Russell shortly before his death, despite having filed for divorce.

But Mr Richards says he believes it was his former client's final wish was to be cremated.

U.S. TV 
network Bravo, which makes the Real Housewives reality show, reportedly held crisis talks yesterday.

According to RadarOnline, executives spoke to Taylor's castmates at fellow star Adrienne Maloof's Beverly Hills mansion.

The show has been thrown into 
disarray, with a question mark over what footage to show of Taylor 
working through their marriage troubles - which was all captured on 
camera.

A source revealed: 'The people at 
Bravo just want to do the appropriate thing. Their first priority is 
being respectful to Russell, Taylor 
and their families.'

The website reports that producers asked the housewives not to talk to the Press about Russell, who was found dead on Monday.

The network is even considering 
pulling the plug on the second series, which is due to on September 5, 
according to The New York Daily News.

A promo was released last month for the upcoming season, featuring Taylor, 
Camille Grammer, Kyle and Kim Richards, Lisa Vanderpump and Adrienne 
Maloof.

In the preview, Taylor was shown crying over the demise of her marriage to 
Russell, with whom she has a five-year-old daughter, Kennedy.

It has now been confirmed by the LA County Coroner that the cause of death was suicide by hanging.

His body was found on Monday at a house in Mulholland Drive.

A friend of the couple, Russ 
McCullough, told TMZ yesterday about Russell's desperate last days and 
how he had 'begged' him for a bottle of Xanax very shortly before he 
took his own life.

McCullough,
who appeared in episodes of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, 
alleges that he gave one pill to his friend after a particularly 
downcast dinner in which Russell could not afford to pay his bill.

According to McCullough, Russell was 
'distraught' over his portrayal on the reality series and said 'this is 
as bad as it gets,' he told TMZ.

McCullough refused to provide the bottle of Xanax as he feared his friends may abuse the drug, the website claims.

Russell, who was aged 47 at the time of his death, has a record of domestic trouble.

Back in 1998, he received a conviction for battery in a domestic abuse case involving his then wife, Barbara Armstrong, according to Entertainment Tonight.

Barbara was granted a protective order
against Russell and he was required to attend a one-year anger 
management program, as well as weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings as 
part of his sentence.

Meanwhile, it has been alleged today that secrets about Russell's sexuality were about to be revealed, Radar reports.

According to sources close to the businessman he was bisexual and worried that a tell-all book was going to out him.

An
insider alleges to Radar: 'About six months ago Taylor confided in a 
close friend that she'd found history for a gay website called 
Adam4Adam.com on Russell's laptop.

He was also spending a lot of time at 
the gym, but his body wasn't changing, which she claims led her to 
believe he was meeting with men he'd met off the website and not 
spending time working out as he claimed,' the source added.

The insider said the book went into 'great detail' about Russell's bedroom preferences.

'Not only was it going to come out 
that Russell was bisexual, but there were people on the record that were
going to talk about the kind of sex he liked,' the source alleged to 
Radar.

'He was into S&M type stuff; choking, and slapping.'

Ed Winter of the L.A Coroner’s Office said: 'He hung himself with no suicide note found.'

No drugs or alcohol were found in the bedroom where Russell died and he was fully clothed when his body was discovered.

Russell is survived by five-year-old 
Kennedy, Aiden, a 13-year-old son from a previous marriage and a an 
11-year-old son with former fiancée Milette Fields.
