Nelson Mandela's ex-wife has dismissed speculation that the former South African president is on a life support machine, saying he is using facial expressions to communicate.

Winnie Madikizela-Mandela said doctors had told her that the ailing 95-year-old could recover his voice, although he is still unable to talk.

Mr Mandela has been at home since September after spending nearly three months in hospital, and the South African government has described his condition as critical and sometimes unstable.

Ms Madikizela-Mandela told South Africa's Sunday Independent newspaper that while her ex-husband was 'quite ill', he was not being kept alive with a life support machine, as some have speculated.

Mr Mandela is suffering from a recurring lung infection.

His home in a Johannesburg suburb has been specially adapted so he can receive intensive care.

Ms Madikizela-Mandela said the Nobel Peace Prize laureate could not speak 'because of all the tubes that are in his mouth to clear (fluid from) the lungs'.

'He can't actually articulate anything... He communicates with the face, you see,' she said.

'But the doctors have told us they hope to recover his voice.

'I have heard this nonsense that he is on life support - he is not.

'It is difficult for him. He remains very sensitive to any germs, so he has to be kept literally sterile. The bedroom there is like an ICU ward.'

Mr Mandela's family has constantly reassured the public that he is as safe at home as he would be in hospital.

Family members and the government have called for Mr Mandela's privacy and dignity to be respected.

Mr Mandela became a pivotal figure in South Africa's democracy after his victory in the first multiracial elections in 1994 put an end to the apartheid system.

Four years earlier, he was released from 27 years spent in prison under white minority rule, 18 of them at the notorious Robben Island penal colony.
