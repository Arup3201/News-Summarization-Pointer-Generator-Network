Iain Lobban, head of GCHQ, said the security service should hire more eccentrics and socially awkward people

The head of the top secret intelligence gathering agency GCHQ has said more socially awkward people should be hired by the UK's security services.

Iain Lobban, director of the Government 
listening station in Cheltenham, said he did not like the term ‘eccentric’ - but said a wide range of skills was necessary if the agency was to be successful.

He said the service should not dismiss talented people just because they do not conform to a certain social stereotype.

He made the comments in a speech to mark 
the centenary of the birth of Alan Turing, the Second World War 
codebreaker and mathematical genius.

Mr Turing killed himself in 1954, two years after being convicted of homosexuality, which was then a criminal offence.

In 2009, then prime minister Gordon Brown apologised for the treatment and vilification that Turing received.

Mr Lobban told an audience at Leeds University: ‘Turing was not an eccentric, unless you believe that there is only one way of being normal and to be otherwise is to be peculiar. Turing wasn’t eccentric: he was unique.’

He insisted that today’s security service needed more people like Turing.

‘I strongly believe [the] agency needs the widest range of skills possible if it is to be successful, and to deny itself talent just because the person with the talent doesn't conform to a social stereotype is to starve itself of what it needs to thrive,' he said.

He added that the service should not allow preconceptions and stereotypes to ‘stifle innovation and agility’.

He said: ‘I want to apply and exploit their talent: in return, I think it’s fair that I don’t need to tell them how to live their lives.'

Turing is regarded as the godfather of the Enigma codebreaker team, which was based at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire in the 1940s.

He also developed a machine which arguably became the model for the modern computer.

He died aged 41 after taking cyanide as an alternative to jail following his prosecution for being a homosexual.

Mr Loban said that if Turing was alive now, he would be working to secure the UK's interests in cyberspace.

He said: "We can't rewrite the past. We can't wish mid-twentieth century Britain into a different society with different attitudes.

'We can be glad that we live in a more tolerant age. And we should remember that the cost of intolerance towards Alan Turing was his loss to the nation.'
