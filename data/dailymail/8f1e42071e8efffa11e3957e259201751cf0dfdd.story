As adults it's easy to voice what we don't enjoy eating - we can actively say we don't want it or scrape the undesired morsel to the edge of our plate.

For babies it is harder to voice a preference - until now.

Engineers from the Thrill Laboratory have developed the world's first 'Baby Thrill-O-Meter' that measures a child’s physiological reaction to certain vegetables, fruits and spices, and in doing so gives parents an idea of what their children like - or don't like - to munch on.

Engineer Brendan Walker, pictured, attached sensors to the feet of babies and fed them foods including mangoes, carrots and lemons. The Thrill-O-Meter, pictured, tracked changes in each child's Galvanic Skin Response. This response is caused by an emotional reaction to the food

1.Mango

2.Cinnamon

3.Lemon

4.Coconut

5.Banana

6.Papaya

7.Red pepper

8.Apricot

9.Sweet potato  

10.Carrot

It uses sensors on the baby’s feet to track changes in their Galvanic Skin Response (GSR).

These responses are caused by an increase in sweat levels that change the skin’s ability to conduct electricity.

Reponses are triggered by an emotional reaction to stimuli, which in this case were the different foods. 

The Thrill-O-Meter was created by engineer Brendan Walker in partnership with baby food experts Ella’s Kitchen.

GSR sensors were placed on the feet of seven babies as they sat in a highchair. 

The results were calculated by analysing increased Galvanic Skin Response from certain foods, combined with facial expression and body language analysis to determine how positive the child's response was. The food which produced the most positive physiological reaction in the babies was mango, pictured

At the bottom of the list were foods in which the flavours aren't as distinctive as those at the top. This included sweet potatoes, pictured, in ninth place

These sensors were then connected to the Thrill-O-Meter machine which tracked micro-fluctuations in sweat levels.

When a baby was excited by a certain food or taste, their sweat levels, and ultimately their Galvanic Skin Response, increased.

The
 higher the score on the Thrill-O-Meter, the more excited the child was 
about the food, which indicated their enjoyment of it.

Walker
 tested the babies’ responses to banana, lemon, cinnamon, mango, 
coconut, papaya, red pepper, apricot, sweet potato and carrot.

Despite its sharp taste, lemon, pictured, came third in the list of top foods the babies enjoyed, according to the Thrill-O-Meter results. Ella's Kitchen plan to use the results to improve its range of baby foods

Yet not all the babies had a positive reaction to lemon, as shown in this child's reaction to the sour fruit

The food which produced the most positive physiological reaction in the babies was mango, followed by cinnamon and then lemon.

In fourth place was coconut, followed by banana and all the foods in the top five have distinctive, recognisable flavours.

At the bottom of the list were food 
in which the flavours aren't as distinctive, including carrot in last 
place, sweet potato, apricots and red pepper.

The flavour which got one of the most neutral reactions was papaya, in sixth place. 

Papaya, pictured left, was the sixth most popular food in the Thrill-O-Meter tests.  At the bottom of the list were foods including carrots, in last place, sweet potatoes, apricots and red peppers, pictured right

All the foods in the top five have distinctive, recognisable flavours, such as coconut, pictured, which took the fourth place spot in the Thrill-O-Meter's list of foods which excited the children the most

The skin, along with all tissue in the human body, can conduct a low-level of electricity.

Nerves,
 for example, transfer information from one part of the body to another 
using currents and similarly, the skin also experiences slight changes 
in electrical charge.

These changes can be measured using sensors.

A
 person’s electrical conductivity can change depending on certain 
situations, and these changes are known as the Galvanic Skin Response.

These responses are caused by sudden changes in emotion, such as excitement or fear. 

The results were calculated by analysing
 increased Galvanic Skin Response from certain foods, combined with 
facial expression and body language analysis to determine how positive 
the response was.

Mr Walker said: 'Food can be really exciting for babies. It's an adventure from their first taste of coconut all the way through to their first piece of mango.

When a baby becomes excited, their heart starts racing, their breathing quickens and their eyes become really large, but the things we can't see are the slight increases in their sweat level. ‘

‘Different food can stimulate different physiological responses and this innovative taste test reveals just how thrilling different vegetables, fruits and spices are for babies.’

Ella’s Kitchen plan to use the results to improve its range of baby foods.

Other fruits the babies were given in order to gauge their emotional reaction were apricots, pictured left, and bananas, right. Bananas scored higher on the Thrill-O-Meter, in fifth place, while apricots were placed in ninth

Ella's Kitchen teamed up the Thrill Laboratory to help develop its range of baby foods and drinks. The company makes natural, organic for babies and toddlers
