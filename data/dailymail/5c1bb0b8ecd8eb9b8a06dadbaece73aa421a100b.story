A Texas man has been arrested for allegedly carjacking an ambulance and taking it on wild joyride, which was caught on camera.

Kenneth Golightly, 29, was apprehended last Wednesday and charged with aggravated robbery in connection to the armed hijacking of a MedStar ambulance in Fort Worth.

Police say the suspect pulled a knife on the driver of the emergency vehicle, telling him, 'I'm taking this ambulance.'

Not obeying the rules: The ambulance ran a red light while going more than 70mph 

According to investigators, the MedStar ambulance had just departed from John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth when the driver pulled over to complete some paperwork.

That is when police say Golightly approached the vehicle and pulled a knife on the driver, reported the station NBC DFW.

The 29-year-old suspect then got behind the wheel and drove off in the MedStar transport, which luckily was not carrying a patient at the time.

A camera installed inside the vehicle captured the long-haired, blond perpetrator running a red light and reaching speeds of more than 70mph before crashing through a metal fence.

The footage ends with Golightly, dressed in a football jersey, unbuckling his seatbelt and preparing to flee on foot.

The stolen MedStar vehicle was damaged in the crash and will have to undergo repairs.
