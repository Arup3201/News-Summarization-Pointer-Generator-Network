These CCTV pictures showing millionaire City lawyer Francis Bridgeman drunkenly swaying through a train station helped show up a web of lies that ultimately led to him being jailed.

Bridgeman, 43, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice for lying to detectives after he crashed his £50,000 Range Rover Sport into a telegraph pole.

Rather than admit what had happened, he concocted a story that he hoped would preserve his reputation.

He told officers who breathalysed him three hours after the crash and found him to be over the limit, that he had been the victim of a kidnapping.

However, Bridgeman’s story unravelled 
when CCTV footage showed him weaving drunkenly along a train platform at
London Bridge Station after a post-work pub binge, where he drank five 
pints of Guinness with a friend.

Police launched a kidnap investigation after the Oxford-educated school governor claimed armed men had stolen the luxury car at knifepoint before taking him away in another vehicle.

A jury in December decided that the story was an elaborate ruse to escape a drink-driving charge.

Sentencing him for 12 months at Lewes Crown Court yesterday, Judge Guy Anthony said: ‘I doubt a drink-drive conviction would have led to this but any conviction of perverting the course of justice is serious.’

Quoting a line from Sir Walter Scott’s poem Marmion, he added: ‘Oh, What a tangled web we weave, When first we practise to deceive.’

A long walk home: Bridgeman walked for three hours back to his oasthouse in East Sussex

The lawyer drove his car off the road
on April 6 last year on his way home to the Grade-II listed, 
£1.25million house he shares with his wife Maggie in Wadhurst, East 
Sussex.

The car snapped a telegraph pole in half and ended up 80 metres away in a field.

But
instead of waiting for police to arrive, Bridgeman set off on foot 
through the countryside for three hours to avoid a breath test.

When 
detectives eventually visited his home and found he was over the limit, 
he said he had been kidnapped and claimed his attackers must have 
crashed the car.

He said: ‘I felt an arm around my throat with what felt like a knife. I was almost in tears and didn’t know what to do.’

Forensic officers found his DNA on the Range Rover’s airbag, showing that he must have been driving the car when it crashed.

Prosecuting, Richard Barton said: ‘The sad truth is you started lying in order to get out of a possible drink-driving offence.

‘You thought that with your experience as a lawyer you would be able to talk your way out of trouble. That lie got bigger and bigger as you went on.

'Like jumping into a bramble bush, it got harder to get out of it the more you struggled.’

Bridgeman, who is a governor of The Skinner’s School in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, resigned from London law firm Macfarlanes in December where he was an equity partner.

DC Emma Penrose-Reed, from East Sussex CID, said last night: ‘Francis Bridgeman tried to portray himself as a victim of crime and continually displayed acts of ill-health throughout the investigation.

‘But due to the hard work and close liaison with our valuable partners at British Transport Police, we were able to discredit his fabricated story and bring him to justice.’
