Councils should charge residents for bin collections and other services - even if it is ‘painful’ for them, a Government minster suggested yesterday.

Education minister David Laws insisted local authorities should be encouraged to ‘take responsibility for themselves’ and ensure they are less dependent on funding from central government.

A third of councils in England now charge to collect garden waste - with one of the highest fees found in Kingston-upon-Thames, south-west London, where it is £75 a year for green wheelie bins.

According to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Laws told MPs on the public administration select committee: ‘There are some local authorities that, because the central government grant has been cut or frozen, are seeking to raise more money from those areas that are more under their control locally.’

The Liberal Democrat added: ‘I'm sure that's not the vision that every local authority would want because that involves some painful decisions for them locally which are not always popular.

‘But it seems to me that type of trend through whichever route is one which we ought to be seeking to encourage in future, so that local authorities can take a degree of responsibility for themselves rather than constantly looking to central government.’

It comes after the Mail revealed on Monday how Eric Pickles had threatened to introduce new laws forcing councils to bring back weekly bin collections after admitting the Government’s previous efforts have done no more than slow the decline.

The Communities Secretary said it had taken Labour ten years to ‘destroy’ the traditional weekly service and suggested it would take as long to restore it.

Councils should also be forced to publicise when long-running contracts with waste firms are up for renewal, giving voters a chance to demand a return to a weekly service, he said.

A BBC survey in July 2012 found a third of England's councils charge to collect garden waste.

That followed a Mail survey in June 2011 that found nearly one in four councils was charging to collect garden waste. Of 267 councils that responded to a poll, 64 charged for a collection service.

As well as Kingston-upon-Thames, other councils who have introduced charges for collecting bins include Wokingham in Berkshire, South Kesteven in Lincolnshire and Kirklees in West Yorkshire.
