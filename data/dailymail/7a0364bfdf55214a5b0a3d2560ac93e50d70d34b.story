A mother-of-two who struggled to run for just two minutes as a size 20 two years ago has now dropped several dress sizes and done the Great North Run. 

Lisa Hanrahan, 34, from Hartburn, once hated exercise as she loathed gyms, but since joining a running group she works out four times a week - and she's gone from a size 20 to a 12.

The finance professional began running with Eaglescliffe Running Group in January 2013, after realising she was struggling to keep up with her two young sons.

Lisa, who lives with husband Fergus and sons Caden, eight, and Finnan, three, said: 'I hadn't done any running since school and I'd never done the distance I can do now. 

'I've struggled with my weight since before I had my first child. 

'I wasn't fit in any way and when I realised I was finding it hard to run around with my children I knew I had to do something about it.

'I joined a couple of gyms but never went more than a few times and didn't enjoy it at all.' But then she learned about the group run by Kelly Francis.

'She starts you off really slowly - a two-minute run then a walk - and when I started I struggled even with that. But Kelly's really encouraging and I did feel like I was progressing each week so I stuck with it.

'Once I saw some improvements, it made me more determined so I watched what I ate, and I do some of Kelly's other classes now as well.'

Kelly and Eaglescliffe Running Group have helped motivate Lisa to exercise four times a week

Breakfast: Big bowl of cereal 

Lunch: Shop bought sandwich and crisps

Dinner: Large portion of barbecue chicken with lots of potatoes

Snacks: Coffee with sugar full fat milk

Breakfast: Scrambled eggs on toast

Lunch: Pasta or salad with vegetables, chicken and cous cous

Dinner: Salmon with greens and new potatoes

Snacks: Coffee with skimmed milk

Lisa started in ERG's beginners' group with the aim of becoming fitter. 

Since then she has become a keen runnner, dropping four dress sizes and three stone, going from 15st 4lbs to 12st 4lbs. 

Lisa hopes to get to 11st

'I'd love to lose another stone and hover around the 11st mark. I'm not so much focussed on my weight; rather on inches and fitness,' says Lisa.

'My eating habits haven't changed that much - thought I started having skimmed milk in my coffees and reduced my portion sizes at dinner. I also stopped having cereals for breakfast because of their sugar content - and despite having a big bowl in the morning I was always starving come noon.

'I will never set foot in a gym, but I exercise a lot.

'I go to the running group on a Monday and on a Tuesday I do Kelly's kettlebells class and on Wednesday I lead my own group running. On a Friday I do Kelly's metafit class - a programme on a CD.'

This year, Lisa's taken part in 5k and 10k events regularly and was delighted to complete the Great North Run. 

The route starts in Newcastle, then takes in the iconic Tyne Bridge, passes by the famous Gateshead International Stadium, and finishes in the coastal town of South Shields.

Lisa's now trained with UK Athletics to lead her own ERG class of beginners and intermediate runners as a qualified instructor.

She said: 'When I signed up for the Great North Run I thought I would only do it once. 

'It was the furthest I've done and it was incredibly hard work training for it. 

'But I think I might do it again. It's the feeling when you complete a challenge like that, there's nothing like it.

'I just love that I can run around with my children now and taking the running groups is going really well. If I can do it, anyone can.
