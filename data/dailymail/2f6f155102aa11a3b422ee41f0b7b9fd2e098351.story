Matt Le Tissier names his five England penalty-takers for a potential World Cup shoot-out with the same authority as he once despatched his own spot-kicks.

‘No 1, Rickie Lambert,’ says the Southampton legend, whose record of 47 successful penalties from 48 attempts qualify him as an expert. ‘It’s not Southampton bias. His penalty record is awesome — impeccable.

‘Leighton Baines at No 2, good technique. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, three and four.

On the spot: Rickie Lambert has never missed a penalty during his time at Southampton

‘Steven has scored a lot of penalties this season, so he’ll be confident. I know Frank has missed a few, but he’s experienced and the sort of lad who would want to stand up and put himself in that position. No 5, Adam Lallana.’

But the records show that Lallana has never taken a penalty for Southampton mainly due to Lambert’s perfect record.

‘I’ve never seen Adam take a penalty,’ said Le Tissier. ‘But with his ability and attitude, I’d be pretty confident.’

Lambert faces a fight to even get into Roy Hodgson’s squad when it is announced on Monday, with Jermain Defoe and Andy Carroll also being backed to be England’s fourth striker.

While his penalty record will not be the decisive factor, it surely gives him an advantage with England having crashed out of six of the last 10 tournaments in shoot-outs.

It might have been different had Le Tissier played in the Euro 96 semi-finals or 1998 World Cup tie against Argentina, but he only won eight caps and none in a World Cup or European Championship.

England’s misses have come in all shapes and sizes. Remember Chris Waddle’s spacebound blast at Italia 90 or David Batty’s weak effort versus Argentina at the 1998 World Cup?

David Beckham skied the first spot-kick against Portugal at Euro 2004.

Jamie Carragher came up with a new one at the 2006 World Cup against Portugal, smashing the ball in before the referee signalled he could take it. He missed his ‘real’ attempt.
