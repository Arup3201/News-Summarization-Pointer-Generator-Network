Graham Rowntree is one of very few Englishmen who knows what it’s like to beat the All Blacks in New Zealand.

It has only happened twice: first in 1973 and again in June 2003, when the side captained by Martin Johnson claimed a landmark 15-13 victory in Wellington en route to World Cup glory in Sydney five months later.

Rowntree attributes that victory to supreme self-belief, and is adamant that the class of 2014 have that in abundance.

On the training pitch: Former England international Graham Rowntree is Stuart Lancaster's forwards coach

The 43-year-old was the tourists’ starting loosehead prop on a night when the England pack stood firm in a series of scrums on their own line, despite having two men in the sin-bin.

Rowntree, now Stuart Lancaster’s forwards coach, has suggested that the success he was part of 11 years ago was founded on confidence and a refusal to succumb to the hosts’ formidable reputation.

‘It’s been referenced a lot, that victory,’ he said in Auckland. ‘It was a special night and what it took was an incredible amount of self-belief.

‘We were lucky because Carlos Spencer missed a few opportunities with ball in hand and shots at goal. But we stuck in there. We were down to six men in a scrum on our own goalline in one period because we had Lawrence (Dallaglio) and Neil (Back) in the sin-bin ... cheers!

‘It’s hard enough with a full deck of cards against the All Blacks, never mind being down to six!

‘We were hanging on for dear life, but that’s rugby — digging in when you’re facing adversity. ‘That was a significant win for that group of players who went on to win the World Cup. It was a stepping stone and that’s what this is for this group of young players. Pitching yourself against the best at Eden Park — it doesn’t get any better or harder than that.’

As England’s reinforcements from the clubs in the Premiership final left Heathrow on Monday, the men already in Auckland were continuing the countdown to Saturday’s daunting series opener against the world champions at a stadium where the All Blacks are defending a 20-year unbeaten record.

‘It’s there to be broken,’ said Rowntree. ‘Our mind-set in 2003 was, “Let’s get after them”, and that’s the same mind-set that we had at Twickenham in 2012 (when England claimed a record 38-21 win).

'We talk about giving the opposition what they don’t want, but we have to better New Zealand’s physicality because, crikey, they bring enough physicality. It’s about not showing them too much respect.’

Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetrees was unable to train again on Monday, meaning he is now certain to miss the Auckland clash. That is likely to mean Kyle Eastmond of Bath is pitched into midfield duty at No 12 alongside Manu Tuilagi.
