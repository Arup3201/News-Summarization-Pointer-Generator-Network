America and its allies must extend the campaign against the Islamic State into Syria, say U.S. military officials.

The U.S. has so far restricted its military action to Iraq, but there are concerns the action against the terror group will not be effective while it still has safe havens across the border.

U.S. Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the Pentagon last night that the current strategy can only contain Islamic State, not defeat it.

'This is an organisation that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,' he said.

'Can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no. That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a non-existent border.'

In the UK senior Tory MP Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former Secretary of State for Defence, went even further, saying the West must be prepared to work with Syria's pariah president, Bashar al-Assad, to fight Islamic State.

'Sometimes you have to develop relationships with people who are extremely nasty in order to get rid of people who are even nastier,' Sir Malcolm told the Financial Times.

Found their footing: Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers stand guard at Mosul Dam in northern Iraq yesterday after it was recaptured from Islamic State militants with the help of heavy air strike support from the U.S. military

The Islamic State insurgency in northern Iraq and Syria is, it seems, leading to a significant redrawing of political allegiances across the Middle East – at least temporarily.

Calls for political engagement with the Ba'athist regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as well as the theocrats of Iran have made them unlikely potential bedfellows of the U.S. and its European allies.

Just 12 months ago, Western lawmakers were seriously debating launching air strikes against Syrian Army positions in an effort to halt its resistance to rebels who sought to overthrow the dictatorship.

Now those very rebels' Syrian strongholds are all but in the sights of the U.S. Air Force's drones and bombers, while a senior UK parliamentarian has identified Assad as the enemy's enemy who is now our friend.

Iran too was facing the threat of military action to halt the nuclear programme which Israel, in particular, feared was working towards an atomic weapons programme.

But with the U.S. saying it may deploy limited 'boots on the ground' to defend American interests in Baghdad there is the bizarre prospect of GIs standing shoulder to shoulder with Iranian Revolutionary Guards already stationed in Iraq.

Meanwhile, Israel's recent air and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, ostensibly against Hamas militants but effectively hitting thousands of Palestinian civilians, has seen the Jewish state's international standing plummet. 

And there are questions about how far Islamic State's power and influence is down to the help of wealthy individuals in Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich U.S. ally.

The kingdom is well-known for espousing a fanatic form of Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism, whose adherents, like the Islamic State's militants, are violently opposed to the beliefs of Shia Muslims in Iraq and elsewhere.

The comments came after U.S. air strikes helped Iraqi and Kurdish forces regain their footing in Iraq, including the recapture of the strategically vital Mosul dam which had been seized by militants.

But U.S. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, who spoke alongside Gen. Dempsey at the Pentagon, warned that the Well-resourced militants from Islamic State can be expected to regroup and counter-attack.

'We're looking at all options,' said Mr Hagel, who said the group, which has capitalised on the disenfranchisement of millions of Iraqi and Syrian Sunni Muslims, was the biggest terror threat the world has ever seen.

'They are an imminent threat to every interest we have, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else,' said Mr Hagel.

Asked if Islamic State posed a threat to the United States comparable to that of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Hagel said the group was 'as sophisticated and well-funded as any group we have seen.

'They are beyond just a terrorist group,' he said. 'They marry ideology, a sophistication of ... military prowess. They are tremendously well-funded. This is beyond anything we've seen.'

The stepping up of rhetoric against the Islamic State - which is alternatively known as ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), or ISIL (the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) - came after the group apparently released a video showing the gruesome murder of an American photojournalist, James Foley.

Militants from the group, which is so extreme in its tactics and ideology it has even been disowned by Al-Qaeda, has seized territory across northern Iraq, but its power base is in regions of Syria rendered lawless by the three-year-old civil war against President Assad's Ba'ath Party regime - a secular socialist dictatorship.

In Iraq, the anger of Sunni Muslims sidelined by the Shia-led government of former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was said to have helped engender public support for the advances of Islamic State militants.

Mr Hagel said: 'ISIS will only truly be defeated when it's rejected by the 20 million disenfranchised Sunni that happen to reside between Damascus and Baghdad.'

But analysts have said Syrians opposed to the Assad's government have been left with a deep sense of bitterness at the apparent change in approach to the regime, which is accused of a range of human rights abuses in its attempts to defeat rebels and win the civil war.

Yesterday marked a year since a chemical attack that killed hundreds near Damascus. Despite uncertainty as to who launched it, the West had blamed Assad's military for the killings.

Hassan Taqieddine of eastern Ghouta, the Damascus suburb hit by the attack, told the Associated Press via Skype that he is still haunted by what he saw that day.

'And here we are, a year later, still getting bombed with barrel bombs, warplanes and chlorine, and no one cares,' he said.

President Assad has long maintained that the uprising against him was a conspiracy carried out by Islamic extremists and terrorists, not a revolt against a dictatorship.

Neither Mr Hagel nor General Dempsey gave any indication of an imminent change in the U.S. military approach in Iraq, which President Barack Obama has said will include further airstrikes but not the introduction of American ground forces.

The Pentagon yesterday said U.S. warplanes had launched six airstrikes overnight to help solidify Iraqi and Kurdish forces' efforts to retake and maintain control of the Mosul Dam.

It said the latest strikes destroyed or damaged three Humvees, multiple roadside bombs and another insurgent vehicle.

The attacks brought to 90 the number of U.S. airstrikes in northern Iraq since August 8. Of those, 57 have been in support of Iraqi forces near the Mosul Dam.
