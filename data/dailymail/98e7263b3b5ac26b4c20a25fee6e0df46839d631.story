Trouble: Ed Miliband's senior Labour colleagues have challenged his election strategy

Britain's reviving economic fortunes have plunged Ed Miliband’s Election strategy into chaos – as senior Labour colleagues challenge his plans for driving David Cameron from power.

The disagreements spilled out at a Shadow Cabinet meeting called to discuss how to reverse the decline in Labour’s fortunes in what has been a torrid summer for their leader.

Defence spokesman Jim Murphy threw down the gauntlet by insisting that the party had to revise its message now that the economy was clearly recovering.

He clashed with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls by insisting Labour could no longer argue the economy was ‘flat-lining’ – a taunt made famous by Mr Balls.

Sources say the Shadow Chancellor retorted that there was no guarantee the economic upturn would last.

Mr Murphy then aimed a thinly veiled criticism at Mr Miliband for avoiding a full-scale clash with unions at the TUC conference the day before.

And the rows continued over the leadership’s plans to focus on attacking the Prime Minister for being privileged.

The meeting was shown polling evidence that the PM is vulnerable to accusations of being out of touch with hard-pressed families.

Their line, strategy director Greg Beales told the meeting, would be that he is ‘for the few, not the many’.

One observer said that Ivan Lewis, the Shadow International Development Secretary, then asked whether that meant they would no longer attack the PM as being incompetent or arrogant.

‘But Miliband simply deferred to Beales, who repeated that polling shows it works to go on about how Cameron is only interested in a small minority of well-off types.’
