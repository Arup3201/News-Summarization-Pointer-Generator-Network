Modernisers: David Cameron has been urged to abandon the 'futile' war on drugs by a Tory think-tank

David Cameron has been urged to abandon the 'futile' war on drugs by a group of Conservative party modernisers who think reform would appeal to young and ethnic minority voters.

Among plans put forward by the influential Tory think-tank Bright Blue is the partial legalisation of drugs in the twin hope it attracts a new generation of voters to the Conservatives, while also saving the country millions of pounds in policing costs.

Bright Blue is backed by senior ministers including Theresa May, Francis Maude and the former minister Andrew Mitchell, and is well-known for its relatively liberal, modernising policy ideas.

The proposal to make partial legalisation a key pledge in next year’s general election manifesto is outlined by an article in the Independent newspaper today.

It is likely to be the most controversial element proposal among several put forward by Bright Blue in a report titled The Modernisers’ Manifesto.

Others reportedly include abolishing universal winter fuel 
payments and excluding students and highly skilled workers from the 
Government’s net migration target.

It also suggests introducing a 
requirement for new teachers to have at least a 2:1 degree in core 
subjects and abandoning automatic pay rises for doctors and nurses.

The idea of partial legalising some drugs reflects a growing international trend following the legalisation of cannabis in a number of U.S. states.

The Liberal Democrats have already expressed a desire to overhaul Britain's laws on drugs, with several Labour members voicing their support for the plans.

The Independent quoted Ryan Shorthouse, director of Bright Blue, as saying it was important for the Conservative modernisers to join the Lib Dem and Labour and enage in the debate.

'What is clear is that much more needs to be done on the development of drugs policy in the UK as the current situation is both economically and socially damaging,' he said.

'We believe that the Conservatives at the next election need to be seen to be taking on the big, difficult issues facing society and not be distracted by the Ukip agenda of Europe and immigration,' Mr Shorthouse added.
