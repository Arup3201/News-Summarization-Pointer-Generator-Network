Masked gunmen have stolen dozens of ‘priceless’ artefacts from the birthplace of the Olympics.

Two men tied up a woman guard at the Museum of the History of the Olympic Games in Olympia and escaped with 68 bronze and pottery pieces.

The guard was the only one on duty, union officials said, because of job cuts caused by Greece’s crippling debt crisis.

It was the second major robbery from a
leading Greek museum within a few weeks. Last month thieves took 
pictures by Picasso and Mondrian from the National Gallery in Athens.

The Olympia museum, which houses 
works from the second millennium BC to the fifth century AD, is due to 
stage the historic ceremony of lighting the Olympic flame at the 
beginning of its journey to London on May 10.

The thieves are reported to have entered at 7.30am local time and ordered the guard to hand over various objects.

When she refused, she was tied up and gagged.

Scene of crime: Two masked armed robbers tied up a female museum guard at the Museum of the History of the Olympic Games in Antiquity in southern Greece and made off with dozens of artifacts

Robbery: It is unclear how many items they stole but police said it was roughly 70 bronze and pottery objects

Assessing the damage: 'The value of the objects stolen has not been estimated yet' said a police official

Reaction: Greece's Culture Minister Pavlos Geroulanos submitted his resignation after the robbery, but it has not yet been accepted

After smashing five glass display 
cases, the robbers hastily stuffed pottery and bronze artefacts into 
bags, risking breaking them.

 A culture ministry official said 
most of the stolen treasures dated from the 9th to the 4th centuries BC,
apart from a gold seal-ring which is well over 3,000 years old.

‘The artefacts were behind reinforced
glass panels which fracture like a car windscreen, and the thieves 
grabbed whatever small objects they could reach through the holes they 
made,’ he said.

‘They took objects made of bronze and pottery – 
figurines, vases and lamps – and the ring.’

Olympia mayor Thymios Kotzias urged 
authorities to improve security at the site, saying: ‘These are 
treasures. A piece of world heritage has been lost.’

Entrance to the museum: Greece has seen a rise in crime as its debt-laden economy has shrunk 16 percent in size from its 2008 peak, leading to youth unemployment of just under 50 percent

Greece’s Culture Minister Pavlos 
Geroulanos submitted his resignation before travelling to Olympia.

Last 
night it was still unclear whether this had been accepted by Prime 
Minister Lucas Papademos, but it was not expected to destabilise the 
Athens government which is rushing to clinch an international bailout to
ease the country’s debt crisis.

A union official said the country’s 
museums were more than 1,500 guards short after two years of public 
sector lay-offs.

Works in the Museum of the History of
the Olympic Games include bronze and terracotta figurines of athletes, 
pottery depicting sportsmen and ancient discs and dumbbells used by 
Olympian athletes in antiquity.
