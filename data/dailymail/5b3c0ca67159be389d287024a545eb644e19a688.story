Ukip has been been blasted for an 'abhorrent' Facebook post likening the EU to the Nazis with a Swastika graphic.

The Swastika, equating the EU to the Nazi regime which murdered millions during the Second World War, was posted on the official Ukip Newport branch page.

The Dad's Army-style post, an apparent parody of wartime invasion plans, shows the Nazi insignia within an EU logo, with arrows suggesting Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat forces are on the brink of invading Britain.

Ukip's Newport branch was blasted for an 'abhorrent' Facebook post likening the EU to the Nazis with this Swastika graphic

The Dad's Army (credits pictured) inspired post appeared to compare the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dem to Nazi forces

Invoking the theme tune of the BBC series, the graphic was headed: 'Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Cameron, if you think old England's done?'

The post, which has since been deleted, was posted on the Facebook page - described as giving 'all the updates on our candidates standing for Newport East and Newport West' - on Wednesday.

Jess Morden, the Labour MP for Newport East, said: 'For Ukip to use a Nazi symbol on a graphic is simply abhorrent. 

'Just a fortnight ago, the local Ukip candidate was removed following publication in the media of his support for the far-right British National Party (BNP) and English Defence League (EDL). 

'It is clear that a dangerous extremist bloc within Ukip are becoming more prominent. Ukip need to take action.' 

Nigel Farage's party admitted the post 'may be in bad taste'

Tory candidate for Newport East Natasha Asghar said: 'I think it's highly insensitive and disgraceful of UKIP to do such a thing.

'I'm going all I can to promote community cohesion and sticking a swastika up isn't helping anybody.'

Paul Halliday, Lib Dem candidate for Newport East, said: 'To somehow equate the other parties with Nazism and to say that Europe is Nazism is naive, distasteful and downright disgusting.' 

Two weeks ago, Ukip's parliamentary candidate for Newport East resigned after internet comments showing him praising a statement referring to gay people as 'fascist perverts' and 'paedophiles' emerged.

Donald Grewar, who was due to stand for the party in Newport East at the general election, was being probed by Ukip after it emerged that he had posted social media comments supportive of the far-right BNP and the EDL.

The Ukip candidate for Newport West - a Labour seat - is Gordon Norrie. 

A Ukip spokesman said: 'The posting on the Newport East Facebook page may be in bad taste.

'Illustrating anything by use of a Swastika is so. However, the confected outrage of the local Labour Party is even more over the top. It must have passed their notice that the branch sees itself as fighting totalitarianism, not supporting it.'

 Invoking the theme tune of BBC series Dad's Army (pictured), the graphic was headed: 'Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Cameron, if you think old England's done?'

The Nazi post is far from the first time Ukip have regretted posts on social media by their party members.

In December last year, a Ukip candidate was banned from speaking at a secondary school after posting a picture of a map calling Africa 'Bongo Bongo Land' on Facebook.

David Little, parliamentary candidate for Dover and Deal in Kent, caused outrage after he posted a spoof 'Ukip map of the world' on his social media account.

The map also referred to the French as 'cheese-eaters' and made reference to 'millions and millions of eastern European immigrants' entering Britain.

 

The party was also forced to axe one of its shortlisted candidates for the General Election after he described mixed-race couples as 'a plague'. 

Mark Walker, 46, was told he could not stand for Ukip in Bromsgrove, south of Birmingham, after the Facebook post in January.

A second social media message by Mr Walker claimed that the Israeli secret service organisation Mossad was responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris. 

Also in January, former Ukip candidate Ian Couch was spared jail after he sent an offensive email to a mosque after Islamic State extremists beheaded a journalist, as well as posting racial slurs on Facebook.

The post contained an image of a pig's head, which was later found in his fridge by police officers.

Couch was found guilty of two counts of sending offensive messages and was handed a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for a year.

Earlier this month, an official Ukip Twitter account said the death of a police officer under investigation as part of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal was 'Karma'.

PC Ali was fatally injured after being struck by a car in Darnall, Sheffield. He was under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission after it was alleged he twice asked a victim out on a date.

Ukip blamed volunteers running the page for the tweet.
