As the run of There's A Monster In The Lake continues, to stellar reviews, Cressida Bonas seems to be setting her sights on securing her next role.

The 25-year-old enjoyed the balmy evening after last night’s performance at the Rosemary Branch Theatre in London by joining director Mike Figgis and others for a drink.

Looking in excellent spirits the blonde hugged several people, chatting animatedly with Mike in her colourful midriff-baring outfit.

The esteemed director is known for films such as Leaving Las Vegas, Cold Creek Manor and One Night Stand.

Nominated for two Oscars, he is highly respected within the industry - getting a part in one of his films would be a huge triumph for the aspiring actress.

Cressida, who wore a blue crop top teamed with a turquoise mini-skirt - showing off those toned legs - must hope that her performance last night impressed Figgis.

The actress also talked to Inglorious Basterds actor Daniel Bruhl who had attended the performance and enjoyed a beer with the cast and Figgis afterwards.

After drinks and chatting with friends and cast Cressida walked to the tube station with friends

Clearly in a jubilant mood, the 25-year-old enthusiastically embraced a friend, while Mike and Daniel looked on

After the drinks, down-to-earth Cressida walked to the tube station with friends.

There's A Monster In The Lake, which was directed by Lily Ashley, and written by Tallulah Brown, follows the tale of an elderly man who, tired of his life in a nursing home, enters a fantasy world where he ends up marrying the Queen of the Woods.

Cressida plays the wolf that guards the way between the two worlds and by all accounts is able to stretch her legs as a comic in the role.

And this foray onto the stage is just the first step of what looks to be a promising acting career for the blonde.

Cressida has recently signed on to do a movie with Dame Judi Dench and Cara Delevingne called Tulip Fever.

But these successes have not been come off the back of her high-profile royal relationship.

Cressida studied dance at Leeds University and acted in a production of Othello there that was so acclaimed it was taken on to Edinburgh Festival.

Earlier in the day, Cressida was seen stepping out in her white Frame Denim dungarees for the second time in a week.

This time around, the all-in-ones got an outing at the park, where Prince Harry's former flame giggled madly as she was swung around by a friend.

She then changed into her blue shorts and cropped top before heading to the theatre for her evening performance, enjoying a cola as she strolled in the sunshine.
