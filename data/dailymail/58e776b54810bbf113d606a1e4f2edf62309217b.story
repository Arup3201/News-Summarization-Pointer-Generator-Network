Walter Cronkite ‘wanted to destroy’ Dan Rather out of jealousy that he was younger and making more money than him, a new book claims.

The veteran broadcaster despised his successor at CBS and supposedly heaped ‘venom’ upon him in a bid to derail his career.

The feud only got worse when he became convinced that Rather had canned his special to mark the 25th anniversary of John F Kennedy’s assassination.

In a withering judgement, Cronkite is quoted as saying: ‘I think it’s unfortunate that any other person feels about another as I do about Dan.

‘But to me, I guess, Dan just reeks of insincerity.’

The claims reopen old wounds in the famously strained relationship between the two men, especially on the side of Cronkite who died in 2009 at the age of 92.

He was replaced by Rather as the CBS evening news anchor in 1981 at the age of 65 in a mandatory retirement that became one of the most rancorous successions in TV history.

According to Cronkite, the forthcoming biography by author Douglas Brinkley, problems really began in 1987 when Rather stormed off the set of the evening news when told he would lose his first 15 minutes of broadcast time because of the U.S. Open tennis coverage.

Cronkite told colleagues he would have fired him on the spot for such a public display of insubordination.

Rather says in the book: ‘It was like he woke up in 1987 and saw me in his old job with successful ratings, making more money than he ever did - and I was relatively young to boot.

‘He wanted to destroy me. I didn’t know what to do. I kept wondering how to handle his venom. 

‘I decided I didn’t want to fight him. So I hunkered down in the fetal position and just took it.’

Cronkite became ‘more and more bitter toward the Rather regime’ when he became convinced that Rather had spiked his proposed Kennedy special.

Rather tells the book that things ‘escalated’ but he was not to blame.

He said: ‘Believe me, it was a complete non-starter from the get-go.

‘It wasn’t… a serious consideration. But Walter created this false scenario that I had somehow nixed his Kennedy special.’

In an effort to quell the row, CBS executives signed Cronkite to a final 10-year deal but ordered him to stop publicly criticising Rather.

Matters were not helped however when it emerged Cronkite would lose his personal staff and that his salary was being was slashed by $850,000 a year to $150,000.

The downgrade came on his 72nd birthday.

The biography, extracts of which appeared in the New York Post, is the latest salvo in the war between the two broadcasters.

According to reports from the time, Rather completely snubbed Cronkite at the 1984 Democratic National Convention even though he was waiting in a studio next door.

For his part Cronkite said that Rather’s replacement Bob Schieffer, who took over in 2005 should have done so sooner and that the new man was ‘one of the great television journalists of our time’.

Cronkite said at the time: ‘Although Dan did a fine job, I would have liked to have seen (Schieffer) there a long time ago’.

Rather’s comments in the biography are all the more surprising as he had been effusive in his praise for Rather when he died and said his ‘admiration for his accomplishments never wavered.’

Cronkite was still alive when in 2006 Rather’s career at CBS came to an end over his bungled 60 Minutes II report on George W Bush’s national guard service.
