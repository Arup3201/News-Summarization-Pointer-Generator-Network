Speaking to Clare Balding in an interview that will be aired on Thursday on BT Sport 1 at 8pm, Van Persie revealed the seven-year-old was training with both United and Manchester City's academies.

'His timing is incredible,' Van Persie said. 'He is very competitive.

'He plays for his local team with his friends and he got scouted and now he is playing for both Manchester United and Manchester City.

'In about a year or so he will have to make his mind up.'

He also talks about Manchester United's miserable season under David Moyes, as they slumped to seventh in the Barclays Premier League and failed in the cup competitions.

Van Persie also described his United team-mate and interim manager Ryan Giggs as 'unbelievable'.

'I have been here for two years now, and since I have been here he as been unbelievable,' said the Dutch striker, who shows off his cookery skills on the Clare Balding Show by helping to make dumplings.
