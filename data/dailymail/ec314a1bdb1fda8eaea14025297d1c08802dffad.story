More than 800 British businesses a day collapsed last year - the highest number ever recorded.

It was the second year in a row in which more companies closed down than started up, according to the figures released by the Office of National Statistics.

The bleak economic outlook is 
discouraging entrepreneurs from taking a risk on a new venture, leaving the prospects for growth even more gloomy.

As many as 297,000 firms across the country folded between 2009 and 2010 - a sharp increase of 20,000 on the year before.

That is more than 813 closures every single day.

In the same year, just 235,000 opened - 1,000 fewer than started up between 2008 and 2009.

It means that the total number of active businesses is declining, leaving Britain in a worrying position.

There were 42,000 fewer active companies in the UK in 2010 than in 2009 - with around 2.3million operating in total.

The extreme actions of the protesters at St Paul's provide a stark reminder of just how bad the country's financial situation has become.

Last year, the worst-hit sector was business administration and support services, which had a 'death rate' of 22.6 per cent, in which 45,000 companies collapsed.

The science and technical industry - a vital area if Britain wants to boost its economy - saw a frightening 53,000 firms close down.

The construction business was also looking weak, with new housing and building work slowing down as the country feels the pinch.

But the booming health industry shows little sign of slowing down despite the grim financial climate.

Just 5,000 health-related firms shut last year - a closure rate of 5.2 per cent.

All sectors and regions now have a closure rate that is higher than their rate of newly opening businesses.

The highest rate of start-ups came in information and communication, where 23,000 opened (a 13.4 per cent 'birth rate').

Even more worryingly, Britain's supposed jobs capital - London - is the part of the country suffering the most.

It had the biggest rate of closures last year, with 60,000 business collapsing - a rate of 15.1 per cent.

Industry in Northern Ireland looks the most healthy, with only 5,000 companies closing between 2009 and 2010.

But it is the North-West of England that is experiencing the worst overall slump in industry, with 8,000 more companies collapsing than were opened last year.

Firms are also failing earlier, with only 90 per cent surviving their first year, where 96 per cent got at least that far in 2005.

The two-year survival rate was down by 5.8 per cent in 2008 from 79.8 per cent in 2005.
