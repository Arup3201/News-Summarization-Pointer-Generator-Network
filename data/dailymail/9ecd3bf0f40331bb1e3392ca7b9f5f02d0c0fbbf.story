Houses bought for as much as £70,000 each under John Prescott's regeneration Pathfinder scheme are now to be sold off for just £1 each.

Liverpool City Council is to offer the Victorian terraced homes in the 'Granby Triangle' area of Kensington at the rock-bottom price to DIY enthusiasts.

Each sale will include a clause for the purchasers to demonstrate they can bring the houses back up to scratch using 'construction skills'.

An estimated £2.2bn was blown on buying and demolishing homes - but far fewer new homes were built for the displaced occupants and others on waiting lists

Homes in the Granby Triangle were 
part of former Deputy Prime Minister Prescott's plan, launched in 2003, 
to raze thousands of homes across the country.

An
estimated £2.2billion was blown on buying and demolishing homes - but 
far fewer new homes were built for the displaced occupants and others on
waiting lists.

The Granby Triangle largely avoided 
demolition due to the 'resilience' of residents who resisted pressure to
leave the blighted properties.

Hundreds
of homes in the triangle were in line to be demolished in a £25million 
scheme promoted by the development company Leader1.

But city chiefs pulled out of the deal after the developers failed to meet deadlines for signing the contract last November.

Private
landlords will also be able to bid for the tender to refurbish some of 
the vacant homes which come complete with the freehold.

Liverpool's
Deputy Mayor and Finance Chief Councillor Paul Brant said: 'This allows
people who may be excluded from mortgages but have construction skills 
to play a part in the regeneration of their communities.

'We've
seen that the private sector model has not succeeded so far and, 
through this way of doing things, if there is any profit it will stay 
with local people.'

Homes in the 'Granby Triangle' area 
of Kensington in Liverpool were part of former Deputy Prime Minister 
Prescott's plan - launched in 2003 - to raze thousands of homes across Britain.

An
estimated £2.2billion was blown on buying and demolishing homes.

However, 
far fewer new homes were built for the displaced occupants and others on
waiting lists.

The Granby Triangle largely avoided 
demolition due to the 'resilience' of residents who resisted pressure to
leave the blighted properties.

Local residents welcomed the idea of bringing the houses back into use.

Granby Triangle householder Theresa MacDermott said: 'This is a much better scenario.

'Obviously
there were delays because of the situation with Leader1, and although 
there's some uncertainty at the moment it's positive.'

As
part of the initial pilot scheme, 20 houses will be offered for sale to
residents for £1 in the Granby area and Arnside Road in Kensington.

In
the 'Webster Triangle' in Picton, the council will either partner up 
with housing associations or 'dispose of the properties to private 
landlords'.

Jonathan 
Brown, spokesman for the Merseyside Civic Society, called the move a 
'true testament to the resilience of people in Granby'.

He said: 'This is what we have been pushing for for years and it's fantastic to see it come to fruition.

'The houses are an asset for the community and the public need them.

'It gives the opportunity for young, 
local people to learn skills in regeneration and construction and give 
something back to the area.

'I think this is a prime example of the council biting off more than they can chew.

'This development is a true testament to the resilience of the people in Granby who have seen promises come and go.

'We fought against Prescott's scheme and it's great to have won all these years later.

'Local people have been let down over and over again for decades.

'I hope this now rolls out to other areas of the city in desperate need of regeneration.'

Council
Liberal Democrat group leader Cllr Richard Kemp had previously 
questioned the decision to get involved with private firms in the 
delivery of social housing.

He now said he hoped the scheme would succeed.

Cllr Kemp added: 'I think this is a good idea, provided there's a solid basis for it.

'Either
housing associations or private individuals need to be doing this, as 
there's no profit to be made out of this kind of scheme, as we've seen 
through those that have failed.'
