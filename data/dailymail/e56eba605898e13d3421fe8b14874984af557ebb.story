Would you eat a sandwich four months past its sell by date? Of course not, but you are probably wearing make-up past its expiry date right now.

Most women only replace their make-up when it runs out, however long that might take and a new survey has highlighted that the majority of women are unaware of a beauty product's shelf life, putting them at risk of anything from a painful eye infection to
 a disfiguring skin complaint.

When questioned 78 per cent of women had no idea that their make-up had a shelf life at all.

And even though 22 per cent of 
respondents were aware of their product's expiry dates, a shocking 82 
per cent said they still kept the 
products well past their use by date.

Best before: A staggering 78 per cent of women are unsure of their make-up's shelf life, meaning they risk infection

Furthermore, when asked to stipulate why
 they kept their products past their sell by date, a third of the 
women polled admitted that they ‘didn’t want to waste the product’, 
while 26 per cent said they ‘couldn’t afford to replace it’.

A canny 18 per cent of respondents 
said they believed that the expiry date was just ‘a ploy’ to get 
consumer to spend more while 11 per cent said the product was still usable even 
after the use by date.

Biggest offender: Mascara is the top item that 
women would use past its use by date, even though it can cause 
painful eye infections

Mascara and eyeshadow were the top two products that women were most likely to use after their use by date.

A spokesman for MyVoucherCodes.co.uk, who carried out the research, said: 'I was quite shocked to see how many women used beauty products way past their sell by date.

'Although it may be costly to throw out expired makeup, especially if they are designer brands, these expiry dates are put in place for a reason.

'If you have too many products that are close to expiring, then perhaps you should cut down on your beauty spending habits. At the end of the day, you are only throwing away your money!'

Dr Hilary Allan – Cosmetic Dermatologist, Woodford Medical Aesthetics said: 'All quality cosmeceutical skincare products should be used within 6 months of opening. 

'The big problem is that these products contain advanced ingredients such as Retinol and Vitamin C that lose their potency if left to oxygenate over time. 

'Meaning they simply won’t do what they should. This is particularly important when using a moisturiser with SPF as you are expecting it to protect you in the sun – it won’t! 

'Another point to mention is that through the oxygenation process the products may separate which can cause allergic reactions on the skin.'

Emma Leslie, beauty editor at online cosmetics shop Escentual.com, added: 'Old make-up can become a breeding ground for bacteria, especially eye products which if shared or kept for a long time can spread infections. So it's not just a fashion thing.

'Be ruthless and honest with yourself and don’t be a hoarder! Ask yourself : When was the last time you used it? Does it suit you? Has it dried up/smell funny/or look odd? And don't forget to give your make-up brushes a thorough clean and throw out any overused sponges as these harbour bacteria like you wouldn’t believe.

'I keep a bottle of bareMinerals Quick Change Brush Cleaner to keep on top of it.

'To keep my make-up bag fresh and free of nasty bugs, I swap over my products regularly.'
