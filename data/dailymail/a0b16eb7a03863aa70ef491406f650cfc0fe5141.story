Residents in California were shaken by a powerful magnitude-6.9 earthquake late last night.

The earthquake took place off the coast of Northern California, but there were no immediate reports of injury or damage and no danger of a tsunami, officials said.

The tremor was just 0.1 off the magnitude classified as a major earthquake which causes serious damage.

A shake map released by the US Geological Survey shows the location and the intensity of the 6.9 Richter scale earthquake 50 miles west of the city of Eureka in California. No immediate damage or tsunami alerts have been reported.

It struck at 10:18 p.m. PDT and was centered 50 miles west of the city of Eureka.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake's epicenter was four miles beneath the Pacific seabed.

It was followed by about a half-dozen aftershocks, including one of magnitude 4.6.

There were no reports of any damage or injuries though the quake was felt widely and strongly, according sheriff's and fire officials in Humboldt County, which includes most of the populated areas near the epicenter.

The National Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami danger for the region.

More than 1,000 people reported on the U.S. Geographical Survey website (USGS) that they felt the quake.

Many reported a long, rolling shake that some said woke children or knocked items off shelves. Some of those respondents live across the border in Oregon.

Jana Pursley, a geophysicist with the 
National Earthquake Information Center, said that based on the area's 
tectonics and past temblors, damages or casualties were unlikely.

Earthquakes
 are very common in Eureka, a city of about 27,000 people about 270 
miles northwest of San Francisco and 100 miles south of the Oregon state
 line.

Nearby Arcata is home to about 17,000 people and Humboldt State University.

The area had a magnitude-5.6 earthquake in February, 2012 that did not cause serious damages or injuries.

An
 offshore magnitude-6.5 quake struck in 2010 and caused bumps and cuts 
among residents and broken glass in some buildings, but it was some 25 
miles closer to land than Sunday night's quake.
