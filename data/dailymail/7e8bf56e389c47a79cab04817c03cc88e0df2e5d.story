For 15-year-old James Dean Johnson II, leaving his hair long is not a sign of rebellion or laziness but rather it is a sign of a kid with a heart bigger than most.

As a small child, James, from Dyersburg,
Tennessee, heard his mother talk about Locks of Love, a non-profit 
organization that specializes in creating wigs for financially 
disadvantaged children under the age of 21.

The organization's mission is to provide those children, who are suffering from long-term medical hair loss, with high-quality hair prosthetics in order to return their self-confidence and normalcy.

James decided at a young age that he wanted to help by donating his own hair.

'I just thought if I had cancer how would I feel if I didn't get the help I needed,' he said.

According to the Locks of Love website, most wigs sold by retailers are built to fit adult heads.

Locks of Love provides custom-made wigs, adapted to fit each child specifically, through donated ponytails.

The wigs return freedom to kids who may feel insecure about losing their hair.

The custom-made pieces allow them to swim and do any kind of sport or activity while wearing it.James' family is no stranger to family members losing hair due to a medical illness.

James' mother, Suzanne Johnson, recounted how her mother battled lymphoma and her grandmother fought lung cancer before both eventually succumbed to their illnesses.

Suzanne says that she cannot bear the thought that children are charged for their wigs (Locks of Love provides wigs for free or on a sliding scale, based on financial need).
