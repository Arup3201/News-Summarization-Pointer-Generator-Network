A new two-part drama series will tell the story of the 'crime of the century' through the eyes of the criminals and the police whose job it was to bring them to justice.

To mark the 50th anniversary of the Great Train Robbery, the BBC has taken a fresh look at the untold story behind the well-known folklore.

The country was left stunned after a train was hijacked and robbed, just 35 miles from its London destination in August 1963.

A 15-strong gang launched a raid on the overnight service from Glasgow at the Bridego Railway Bridge in Ledburn, Buckinghamshire in the early hours of August 8.

Led by the charismatic Bruce Reynolds, who is played by bright actor Luke Evans, 34, the group of mid-level criminals and a corrupt solicitor pulled off the infamous heist, making off with £2.6million.

The bulk of the huge haul of money was never recovered.

The gang fled the scene, seeking shelter at Leatherslade Farm. It was after police officers uncovered their hideout that incriminating evidence led to the arrest and conviction of most of the gang.

Leader Reynolds escaped the law for five years after going on the run, but was eventually tracked down and jailed for 25 years in 1969.

The mysterious crime baffled and frustrated police, but thrilled the general public with the press hailing the gang 'plucky heroes'.

The first film, A Robber's Tale, focuses on the story of Bruce Reynolds as he masterminds the raid on the Royal Mail train.

It is followed by the second installment, A Copper's Tale, telling the story from the perspective of DCS Tommy Butler, the police officer leading the investigation aimed at bringing the gang to justice.

The films, written by Chris Chibnell - the man behind the hit ITV drama Broadchurch - will be shown on BBC One on consecutive nights next week.

The Torchwood and Doctor Who writer, said his depiction aims to tell the untold side of the much-debated crime.

He said: 'It is a piece of modern folklore so you grow up knowing there was this extraordinary event.

'I was born in 1970, so it was seven years before I was born but I always knew of its place in British history but also there is a sense of myth to it as well.'

'I had always known the general sense of the story but when I started to research both these films I had a much greater sense of the detail of it,' he added.

'What's happened in the ensuing years is the stories of the escapes, the journey to Rio, all the stuff that happened after they were sent to prison, most of the attention has gone on that side of the story.

'Whereas I think the detail of the planning and the detail of how the robbery took place and what happened afterwards has been absolutely lost.

'That is what excited me when I was researching it, to go there is a huge story here.

The robbery was well-rehearsed and thoroughly planned. The gang targeted the overnight Glasgow to London Royal Mail train, striking at Ledburn in Buckinghamshire

'There is a huge story on the side of the guys who carried out the robbery and actually the absolutely untold story of the Flying Squad, the story of Tommy Butler, a guy who never gave a press interview, and his team of policemen who took the robbers down.

'There is a huge side of the story that I thought I don't know about, and I have certainly never seen it told in a drama... so that was the thrilling thing.

Speaking to the BBC about his role, he said: 'In real life the great train robbers spent a lot of time with each other, so what you are very aware of is that they would never ever do anybody in.'They never gave up names of the crew – even if they went to prison. So there was this camaraderie, this real sense of friendship between them. So we [the cast] hung out a lot.'The first film sees what happens as the robbers retreated to a farmhouse to divide up their stash and keep a low profile.

It also explores the fall-out after driver, Jack Mills, got hurt and why even their best laid plans had to be changed causing some members to be on the run for the rest of their lives.In one of the stills, the robbers are seen forming a human chain to unload the bags, carrying the money which is the equivalent to £40 million today.The story is then turned on its head as DSC Tommy Butler, played by Jim Broadbent, gets to work with six of the best officers from across London.Speaking about taking on a real life figure, Jim said: 'In some ways it’s a challenge and in some ways it’s a great help because you’ve got the research you can do, archive footage, documented material.Adding: 'Interrogation scenes are always nice to do in a way, particularly with a good script and good actors. It was fascinating how all the interrogations varied with different characters.'Though Reynolds was undoubtedly the gang’s leader, it was Ronnie Biggs, a relatively minor player, who would achieve the greater fame during the decades he spent on the run.‘When I took on the role of Biggs,’ says actor Jack Gordon, ‘I only knew about him from reading about his antics in the tabloids.'During filming my affection for him grew and grew. I’ve come to see that, even though he was a criminal, he was no monster. He was a decent bloke, a committed family man. People enjoyed his company. He was a chancer.'The Great Train Robbery: A Robber's Tale and A Copper's Tale will be shown on BBC1 on December 18 and 19 at 8pm.
