You'd think they might want to save their energy.

But it seems that Olympic athletes will be working up more of a sweat off the field than they will on it this Summer.

In a sign of what the world's fittest sportsmen and women get up to in the Olympic village, a record 150,000 free condoms - 15 for each competitor - have been made available to them.

The phenomenal outpouring of prophylactics means there will be 50 per cent more available to athletes in London than the 100,000 handed out at the last Olympics in Beijing in 2008.

It works out at nearly 15 each for the 
10,500 competitors taking part in the Games, with Durex ready to 
deliver more if the sports stars exhaust their ration.

They will, of course, be able to take a trip to the nearest chemist if they run out.

If sexual appetites among are as voracious as former Olympians have suggested, they're going to need every last one of the condoms provided.

Women's football goalkeeper Hope Solo told the Daily Mirror: 'There's a lot of sex going on at the Olympics.

'I've seen people having sex out in the open, getting down and dirty on grass between buildings.'

She added: 'I may have snuck a celebrity into my Beijing room without anybody knowing and snuck him back out. But that's my Olympic secret.'

Earlier this month an anonymous U.S. athlete described partying her 'butt off' when she took part in the Games, amid wave of promiscuity as super-fit athletes paired off.

'I was feeling super-guilty for 
cheating on my boyfriend,' she told the New York Post. 'And a fellow 
athlete said, "Why? Everyone hooked up last night".'

A
 tell-all expose published earlier this year echoed the anonymous 
athlete's experiences. That book, the authors of which also remain 
unknown, lifted the lid on the secrets of the Olympic Village.

It claimed competitors smuggled in drugs and filled water bottles with liquor to get it into the drugs and alcohol free zone.

The author wrote of bed-hopping and 
partying, adding: ‘No matter what your type, the Olympic Village can 
cater to it, providing the best physical examples on earth.

‘Having
 completed competition, the athletes need to do something else to burn 
off their boundless energy.

'Like thoroughbred horses which haven’t had a
 run for a while, they get frisky.’

The athletes stay in a tight-knit community where 'what happens in the Village stays in the Village,' the book claims.

It is a promise that is easily kept, given the high-security, walled off community they spend the duration of the Games living in, protected from prying eyes.

Competitors sexual appetites seem to have soared since Seoul 1988, when just 8,500 condoms were made available.

For Barcelona in 1992, that number leapt up to 50,000. In the 2000 Sydney Olympics, organisers had to order 20,000 more after the initial allocation of 70,000 ran out.

However, the bed hopping may be slightly less frenetic with the London Games, since this year athletes' partners will also be allowed into the Olympic Village for the first time.
