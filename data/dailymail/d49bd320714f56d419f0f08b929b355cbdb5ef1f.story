There was no rest for Andy Murray ahead of tomorrow's Wimbledon final as he was put through his paces in a final training session before his showdown with Novak Djokovic.

The Scotsman looked relaxed and in good form as he trained in the blazing sunshine at the All England Club today.

Murray spent time talking to fans and signing autographs as he left the practice court at SW19 early this afternoon.

His final training session came before French number one Marion Bartoli won the women's contest on Centre Court beating German Sabine Lisicki in straight sets.

Murray didn't seem to be showing any ill effects from his epic semi-final comeback last night, when he beat Jerzy
Janowicz in a draining four sets.

But he will have to get used to the sapping hot weather with forecasts expected a scorcher as he takes to Centre Court tomorrow in the final for the second year running.

A loser in last year’s final, the British Number 1 will have a second chance tomorrow against number one seed Djockovic.

The Serb won the competition in 2011 beating Rafael Nadal in the final whereas Murray lost out to seven times champion Roger Federer last year.

Djokovic is 8/13 favourite to take the title again according to bookmaker Paddy Power, with Murray 11/8 to claim victory.

Murray's win last night was the most-watched TV moment of the year so far, the BBC said.

A peak audience of 13.2 million people tuned in to see last night's match, a spokesman for the broadcaster said today, making it the most-watched moment across all channels.

Even more people are expected to tune in to watch the British number one take on Novak Djokovic in the final tomorrow.

The All England Club said 31,084 people attended yesterday - an increase of 760 on the same day last year.

Murray may have been away from Centre Court today, but was taking time out to prepare for his latest bid to become the first British player to lift the men's Wimbledon trophy since Fred Perry in 1936.

But for Murray, a win tomorrow might not top his Olympic gold medal win on the same court against Roger Federer last summer.

He said: 'I don't know if I'll ever have the sort of feelings like I had that day.

'Winning Olympic gold here, a home Olympics ... I'll never get the opportunity to do that again.

'It was probably one of the proudest moments of my career. I don't know if I'll ever top that.'

He also said that although his win last summer coupled with reaching the Wimbledon final raised the nation's expectations, he doesn't feel it put too much weight on his shoulder.

He said: 'I don't think it brought any less or more pressure.'

Letting her hair down: Laura Robson showed off her toned legs as she had a night out on the town

Support: Robson had been at Wimbledon all day yesterday as she watched both Djokovic and fellow Brit Andy Murray reach the men's final

Meanwhile, fellow tennis ace Laura 
Robson put her tears to one side as she partied the night away at 
London's Mahiki nightclub on Friday. 

No
doubt celebrating her fellow Brit Murray getting through
to the Wimbledon final, the teenage sports star cast her own Wimbledon woes aside as she
enjoyed a night out on the town.

Before heading out to Mahiki, the 
tennis star had spent the day watching all the action at SW19 as Murray 
took on Janowicz and world number one Novak Djokovic played Argentina's 
Juan Martín del Potro in a particularly tense semi-final. 

Writing on her Twitter page in a series of posts, she said: 'This match is too good. #Djokovic #DelPotro.'

Laura's Wimbledon dream came to an end 
on Monday when she left Court No 1 fighting back tears after suffering a
defeat at the hands of Estonian Kaia Kanepi.

Fans gathered in their thousands at SW19 this afternoon as the women's competition reached its climax.

Hundreds converged on SW19 this 
afternoon to watch the action from Centre Court's match between Marion 
Bartoli and Sabine Lisicki in the sunshine on Murray Mount.

Bartoli serged ahead taking the first set 6-1 in just 30 minutes and won the second set 6-4 to take the crown.

The French player fell to her knees in joy as she emerged triumphant in the thrilling clash to claim her first grand slam title.

German
hopeful Lisicki, who broke down in tears during the match as she felt 
her hopes slipping away, was overcome with emotion as she lost out on 
the trophy.

But she still 
had the backing of fans on Centre Court who applauded her efforts as 
Bartoli ran across the court and climbed into the player's box in 
keeping with Wimbledon tradition.

A delighted Bartoli lifted the Venus 
Rosewater trophy to cheers from the crowd. She will also receive a 
cheque for £1.6million for her win.

During a courtside interview after 
her win, she said: 'Honestly I cannot believe it. When I was a little 
girl I dreamed of this moment for so long.

'I missed out in 1997, I know what it is like and I'm sure Sabine will be here one more time, no doubt about it.

'Finishing
with an ace, in my wildest dreams I'd never believe it. I have 
practised my serve for so long, at least I kept it for best moment.

'Holding this trophy has been my dream since I was six years old. I cannot believe it and I hope to do my best again next year.'

The 28-year-old paid tribute to her father Walter - who coached her until this year - for his backing.

He
was among friends and family who supported her from the players' box 
and she made a beeline for him as she clambered up from the famous lawn.

This
was Bartoli's first tournament title of any sort since 2011 and, at 28 
years, nine months, she became the fifth-oldest first-time Grand Slam 
winner in the Open era.

Her
opponent Lisicki struggled to contain her emotion as she told the BBC's
Sue Barker: 'I still love this tournament so much, I still love this 
court a lot and I love you guys, you have supported me so much this 
entire tournament and today you helped me get over my nerves.'

The tearful runner-up broke down as she thanked her team.

She said: 'I was just overwhelmed by this whole situation but credit to Marion because she has been in that situation before and she handled it perfectly now.'

She added: 'This was my first grand slam final and I wish I would have won it but I hope we get the chance on more time.'
