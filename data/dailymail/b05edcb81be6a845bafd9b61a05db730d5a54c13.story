Kentucky Fried Chicken has launched a new mobile phone app which allows customers to order and buy food before they arrive at an outlet.

The so called 'mobile wallet' technology is already in use at McDonald’s, Starbucks and other fast food and high street restaurants.

The trial is starting small, with just ten locations across the UK using the smart phone feature. But if it is successful it could roll out across the country and to the U.S.

Kentucky Fried Chicken has launched a 
new mobile phone app  which allows customers to use a order and buy food 
before they arrive at an outlet.  It is hoped the smart technology will account for 5 per cent of 
transactions

Airtag, which built the app for KFC, 
said it hopes the smart technology will account for five per cent of 
transactions at the chain in the next year. 

But the company predicts that figure will grow drastically in the next year, it is reported.

Starting immediately, KFC will be piloting Airshop in ten restaurants across the UK, including in Woking, Surrey, where headquarters are based.

The app is available for iPhone users and the web app is available for all connected devices.

It comes equipped 
with geolocation 
mapping technology to locate the nearest KFC, mobile and web ordering and payment 
capabilities, a mobile check-in feature for in-store order recall and a 
customer account so users can store ordering history, favorite products 
and payment details for one click payments.

KFC Fast Track users can pick up their order any time on the day an order is placed.

Upon arrival at the selected ordering location, the user will do a mobile check-in to let KFC staff know they are present in the store.

After doing the mobile check in, the user gets to skip the line and proceed directly to a checkout dedicated to KFC Fast Track users.

In the future, KFC Fast Track will include geofencing so users can do the mobile check-in before they arrive at the restaurant.

It joins a host of other high food 
chains to make the most of the mobile market, including Domino's, Pizza 
Hut, and Chipotle in America.

PayPal, the payment arm of e-commerce 
company eBay, has also announced it is developing apps that allow people
to order and pay in restaurants without having to hang around for a 
waiter to bring the bill.

And last year Starbucks began replacing the payment systems in its 7,000 U.S. outlets with mobile payments technology.

'Our customers lead increasingly busy
lives and KFC Fast Track is focused on helping them order, pay for and 
collect their food faster than ever before, delivering a great 
experience throughout,' said Paul Borrett, IT Director of KFC UK & 
Ireland. 

'We look forward to working closely 
with AIRTAG and adding many more innovative features to KFC Fast Track 
in the coming months.'

Jérémie Leroyer CEO and Co-Founder of AIRTAG added: 'KFC Fast Track will renew the ordering experience in a way that meets new consumer demands for efficiency onset by the increasing importance of multi-channel commerce shopping.
