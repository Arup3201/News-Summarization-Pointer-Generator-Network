Two veterans of the UFC heavyweight division will meet on Sunday night in Porto Alegre, Brazil, as Antonio ‘Bigfoot’ Silva faces former heavyweight champion Frank Mir, in what is arguably a must-win fight for both men.

With Mir’s last win under the UFC banner coming back in December 2011, and Silva’s dating back to February 2013, the Brazilian crowd can expect to see two giants in the Octagon throw caution to the wind as they look to underline their relevance in the division.

And Silva is especially keen to return to winning ways in front of his countrymen.

Silva says it is 'important' to him that he wins and pointed out he always won his fights held in February

'It is really important to me to win, especially because of the opportunities the UFC has been giving me.' he told Sportsmail. 'And you know what, I have fought four times in February in my career and won all of them.

'I don’t feel any pressure. It doesn’t matter where I am fighting; I just want to win and I will give my best.'

But while 'Bigfoot' was respectful of his opponent, he remains adamant that he will be looking to finish the bout as quickly as possible, once the contest gets underway:

'Mir is a great athlete. He has many strengths but he also has his weaknesses,' he said. 'I will try to explore these flaws and finish the fight as fast as possible. People can expect a tough fight, with Bigfoot looking for the win all the time – this is what matters to me, the victory.'

Mir was also quick to compliment his opponent.

'I don’t think he has any weaknesses, he is a very tough guy and I expect it to be a five round fight,' he said.

Coming into the clash on the back of a four-fight losing streak, nothing but a win will be enough to guarantee the American submission specialist another outing with the promotion.

'I’ve been training really hard with my team,' Mir said. 'I expect lots energy, it’s an exciting crowd, I know that.'

While Silva and Mir command top billing, another bout that pits Brazil against America, this time in the lightweight division, has been booked for the event’s highly anticipated co-main event.

Holding the No 6 spot in UFC’s 155lbs rankings, spectacular striker Edson Barboza meets No 12 ranked Michael Johnson, in a fight that could see a new title contender emerge.
