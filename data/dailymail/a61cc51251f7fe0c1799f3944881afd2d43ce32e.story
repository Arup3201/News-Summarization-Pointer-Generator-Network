A wife who suspected her husband of having an affair armed herself with a baseball bat to attack the mother in their children's school playground.

Mother-of-six Kelly Mochan, 31, turned the school run into chaos when she went hunting for fellow parent Katie Vincent with the metal bat.

Furious Mochan stormed into Pyle Junior School at the end of the day looking for Miss Vincent, 31, who she believed was sleeping with her husband.

But when she realised Miss Vincent's mother was picking up them up after school, she attacked her instead and cracked the grandmother's skull with the bat.

Cardiff Crown Court was told grandmother Tonia Vincent was smashed on the head with the bat while terrified children and parents looked on during the playground battle in Pyle, near Bridgend, Wales.

After Mochan was given a 12-month 
community order, the victim told The Sun newspaper that it is 
'unbelievable' she was not sent to prison.

Prosecutor Mike Hammett explained to the court: 'She told the gran: "I’ll get your f***ing daughter" as she was going through the car park.

'There was an exchange of words and she said she was going to kill Katie for what she had done.

'Nonsense': Katie Vincent (pictured) says Mochan's accusations were ridiculous

'Mrs Vincent reminded her there were children present and she took a baseball bat from her car, raised it and hit her on the head.

'There was struggle, they both fell to the ground and the teaching assistants intervened.

'The grandmother was then taken to hospital with swelling and bleeding from her head.'

Mochan, who walked away with the community order after admitting causing actual bodily harm, had some of her six children with at the time of the attack.

She claimed she kept the bat in the car for her children to play with and had taken it out as a warning.

Katie Vincent, a mother of two, denied she was having an affair with Mochan’s husband Stuart.

She said: 'It was all untrue nonsense. She had threatened me earlier in the local supermarket and the police were called.

'I’ve been too afraid to pick the kids up from school. I’m just so glad the summer holidays have started.'

After the case, Tonia, 53, said: 'I thought I was going to die in the school playground in front of my own grandchildren.

'She was screaming and yelling, and her language was atrocious. She kept saying she was going to kill Katie.

'She walked over to her car and 
started getting something silver out of the boot. I didn’t know what it 
was at first - but then I saw it was a baseball bat.

'Her face was so angry it was distorted. Then she swung at me out of the blue and I felt it crack against my skull.

'I could feel warm blood trickling down my head. The doctors told me I had a very lucky escape.

'She was a lunatic. A mother of six 
should be ashamed of herself for behaving like that. I just hope she 
gets treatment for her anger - she needs it badly.'

School ground spat: The mother stormed the playground and swung for the grandmother. She has now patched up our marriage

Cardiff Crown Court heard how she had since left the village and is living in Port Talbot, near Swansea, with her husband.

The pair have now patched up their marriage and are making a new start.

Judge David Wynn Morgan warned her: 'The school gate is not the place for the airing of opinions and grievances about your husband’s extra-marital activities.

'You are a mother of a large number of children and a very good mother to all those children.

'This occurred at a time of domestic turmoil, which has now resolved itself and you apologised at an early stage and expressed remorse.'
