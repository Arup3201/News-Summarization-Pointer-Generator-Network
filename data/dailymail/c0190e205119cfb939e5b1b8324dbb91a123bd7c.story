The father of Hannah Truelove, 16, who was found dead behind her mother's apartment complex on August 24, has spoken out for the first time about the horrific ordeal.

Gainesveille, Georgia, officials have refused to go into detail about her death, stating only that it was 'violent'. Jeff Truelove had to identify his little girl's body.

'I can't understand it. I mean, who can do that to somebody?' he said. 'It's so brutal.'

His statements come at the same time the police have announced a breakthrough in the hunt for her killer, a vehicle they say may be connected to the crime.

Hannah was reported missing by her mother on Thursday night at 10pm. The
teenager’s body was discovered in the woods behind the  Lake Lanier 
Club Apartments complex.

Jeff Truelove described his daughter as sweet and loving. He said that 
he had been teaching her how to drive and she had 
dreams of becoming a veterinarian.

'You don't know her, but I know her. Nobody would want to hurt her,' he said to WSBTV.

He said the only clue he had to figuring out who killed her was her apprehension to ride the bus to Gainesveille High School.

'She wouldn't go to school sometimes, mainly because of riding that bus,' he said.

Officials also believe that she may have known her killer.

'Sometimes we have spent literally up to 24 hours a day of nonstop, most
of our days are sometimes 12, up to 18 hour days at times,' Hall County
sheriff’s Major Woodrow Tripp said.

They have also narrowed in on a vehicle they say may be connected to the
crime: a late 1990s to early 2000s four-door Chevrolet with front-end 
damage and a lighter-colored door panel.

'This vehicle was certainly in the area. The vehicle was seen with 
Hannah at one point where she possibly exited it,' Major Tripp said.

Clue: Officials have also narrowed in on a vehicle they say may be connected to the crime: a late 19902 to early 200s four-door Chevrolet with front-end damage and a lighter-colored door panel, similar to the one pictured

Beginnings: Jeff Truelove described his daughter as sweet and loving. He said that he had been teaching her how to drive and she had dreams of becoming a veterinarian

Hannah had mentioned a stalker on her Twitter account and said in another post that she was 'scared'.

Friends of Hannah's have said they wished they had paid
more attention to ominous messages she posted online before she 
vanished.

High school student Cristina Robles told Atlanta Journal-Constitution: 'I didn’t take it seriously. I think I could have helped and talked to her about it and taken it more seriously.'

Her
death was declared a homicide on Monday although cause of death has not
been made public and police were releasing few details.

Sgt Kiley Sargent with the Hall 
County Sheriff's Department said that 
authorities don't believe it was a random assault and have information 
that Hannah may have known her attacker.

Police were analyzing the messages as
family and friends were struggling to understand if Hannah had meant 
the tweets to act as a warning.

Detectives were going through dozens 
of tips they have received about the schoolgirl to try to determine 
exactly what happened to her.

They were encouraging anyone who might have
information about Truelove to come forward.

Neighbors
at the apartments saw Hannah sitting at the picnic tables in the 
complex around 4pm on Thursday while others said she was there as late 
as 7.30pm. 

Ominous: Detectives are looking into whether the teenager was killed by a stalker; they are asking the girl's friends and family about her tweets including this August 12 post

Investigating: Detectives are trying to make sense of Truelove's posts on Twitter

The teenager’s body was discovered in
the woods behind the gated complex of the Lake Lanier Club Apartments, 
where she lived with her mother.

Authorities
have classified the schoolgirl’s death as ‘suspicious’ and detectives 
are questioning her family and friends about her eerie tweets.

In the days before her death, the teenager posted a series of cryptic messages on her Twitter account:

August 12, 2.03pm: I got me an uglyass stalker

August 18, 7.23pm:  So scared right now

August 18, 7.38pm: Everytime we talk, I feel sick

August 22, 5.31pm: I need to move out of these dang apartments

On August 12, she posted: ‘I got me an uglyass stalker’ and followed it up with a tweet which read, ‘This can’t be happening…’

The following week, on August 18, she wrote: ‘So scared right now.’

Fours days later, on August 22, the day before she was reported missing, she tweeted: ‘I need to move out of these dang apartments.'

However, many of Hannah's tweets are of song lyrics and sound typical of a teenager going through a break-up.

On Friday night, a grandfather visiting his grandchildren found Hannah’s body as he walked through the woods.

As
investigators continued to follow every tip today, grief counselors 
attended Gainesville High School, where Hannah was a student.

'She had a huge heart. She always put people before herself,' friend Joshua Morrow told Fox News.
