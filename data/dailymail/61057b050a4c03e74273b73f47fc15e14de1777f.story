Three men have been arrested by police searching for a hit-and-run driver who mowed down a 10-year-old girl and her two-year-old brother.

Sabah Saleem and her brother Rayhan 
were critically injured when they were hit by a car in the Hyde Park 
area of Leeds, West Yorkshire.

Today police confirmed they have arrested three Leeds men, aged 39, 36 and 26, in connection with the incident.

The 36-year-old man is being 
questioned by detectives on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to 
stop after a collision and failing to report a collision.

The 39-year-old man was arrested on 
suspicion of dangerous driving and the 26-year-old was held on suspicion
of assisting an offender.

The 26-year-old man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender was later released on bail pending further inquiries. The two other men remain in custody, West Yorkshire Police said.

At the scene today, the children's aunt, Saima Rafique, said she had just returned from the hospital where her niece remains in a critical condition.

But she said Rayhan is much better and walking around on the ward.

Mrs Rafique said: 'Most likely what happened is that Sabah tried protecting her brother and she took the brunt of the accident.

'She's just a little hero, isn't she?

'It just shows you how a big sister would react with a younger brother.'

Appeal: Detectives believe this woman may well have witnessed what took place and seen the car in detail

Mrs Rafique, who is a nurse, said the children's parents, Tazeem Noor and Mohamed Saleem, remain at their daughter's bedside.

'It's been very upsetting for all the family,' she said. 'Rayhan has made some improvements, which is very good for us.'

Mrs Rafique said the police investigation appeared to be very thorough and she thanked officers for their efforts.

She also thanked the public for the support the family has received.

'We all appreciate this so much - the
public, everyone's input towards this. We can't thank you all enough. 
It's just been so touching and we appreciate this so much.'

Mrs Rafique said the family were "very, very concerned" about the dangers posed by the road.

'It's a very, very busy road which leads into the centre of Leeds,' she said.

'It's a main road that everybody uses - a lot of turnings, a lot of lorries.

'A lot of accidents have occurred in 
this road. We're just wishing and hoping that something can be put in 
place, that something can be done about this road.

'Either we would like some speed 
cameras, some double yellow lines, even give the residents some parking 
permits so no other people can park on this road.'

Detective Superintendent Paul Taylor,
leading the investigation, said Sabah may have tried to push Rayhan 
from the path of the car.

He added: ‘We have heard from Sabah’s
family that she was like a little mother to Rayhan, so it’s very 
possible that she tried to get him out of the way.’

Police officers document evidence at the scene of the incident which saw a Vauxhall Astra hit the two children and speed off

Scene: The siblings were hit by the car near to the Makkah Masjid Mosque in Leeds' Hyde Park area

They had been on their way home after
buying onions for their mother before the family’s Eid celebrations 
when they were hit by a silver Vauxhall Astra on Brudenell Road at about 5.20pm on Saturday.

Officers said the driver slowed down to see
what had happened, then sped away.

The children’s uncle, Aroon Rafique, 
said: ‘How anybody could leave two children in the street is beyond me. 
We need to know how somebody could do this.’

Their aunt Azra Rafique said: ‘We just want somebody to come forward and let us know who this  person is.

‘It’s not safe for our children. It 
could happen to somebody else.’

Police also released a picture of a potential witness yesterday.

Detective Superintendent Taylor, of 
West Yorkshire Police, described the tragedy as ‘a catastrophic incident
on what should have been one of the happiest weekends of their year’.

He added: ‘We can now release a CCTV image of the car we believe was 
responsible.

‘Anyone who recognises this vehicle should contact us as a matter of urgency.

‘We also know there was a woman who 
was on the street at the time who we have not spoken to yet, and would 
ask her to make contact with us as soon as possible.’

He urged the driver of the Astra – manufactured between 1998 and 2005 – to come forward.

Police recovered a vehicle in connection with the incident last night.

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'Three people have now been arrested in relation to the fail -to-stop collision on Brudenell Road.

'A 36-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and failing to stop and failing to report a collision.

'A 39 year old man has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving. A 26-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

'All three men are from the North West Leeds area.

'Ten-year-old Sabah remains in a critical but stable condition and her two-year-old brother Rayhaan continues to improve.'

Sabam and her brother were taken to Leeds General Infirmary for treatment
