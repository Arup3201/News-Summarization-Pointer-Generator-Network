Aston Villa defender Aly Cissokho revealed how AC Milan pulled out of a deal to sign him... because of problems with his teeth.

AC president Adriano Galliani claimed he had signed the world's best left back when he agreed a deal to sign the Frenchman from Porto for £12m back in 2009.

But just 48 hours later the Italian giants pulled out of the deal, blaming a dentist's report.

Speaking to The Sun, Cissokho said: 'The problem only developed when Milan tried to agree a different deal with Porto. 

'Milan said there was some kind of problem with my body, which was linked to my teeth!

'But it was just an excuse because I completed my medical in two hours, with no problems. 

'I even signed Milan's contract and all that remained was for Milan's president to send the money to Porto's president.'

Cissokho is hoping to prove AC Milan wrong having signed for Villa on a permanent deal from Valencia in the summer.

The 27-year-old defender spent last season on loan at Liverpool and has played almost every minute of the Birmingham club's blistering start to the season.
