Roaming the luscious grounds, bathing in water, scoffing on watermelons and putting on a show - Thug and Nicky, the pygmy hippos, certainly look happy to call London home.

The latest additions to the zoo's new Into Africa enclosure, 17-year-old Thug and 19-year-old Nicky, took their first furtive steps into their bespoke home this morning.

The 'Luxury' enclosure boasts heated pools, hand-crafted gardens and a round-the-clock staff to care for the pair with a ready supply of the hippos' favourite snack - sliced watermelon.

Pygmy hippos are an endangered species and have been at the forefront of London Zoo's conservation work.

A spokesman for the zoo said: 'Pygmy hippos are under constant threat from poaching and habitat-loss in the wild, where conservationists estimate that less than 3,000 individuals remain.'
