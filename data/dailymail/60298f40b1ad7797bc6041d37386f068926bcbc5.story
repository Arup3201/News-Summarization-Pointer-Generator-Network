A boy who missed his grandparents after they moved abroad has started a blog to help others in the same situation.

Harry Hamer, 10, from Uppermill, Saddleworth, set up the online journal to share his feelings and swap ideas about how to cope when relatives live far away.

His grandparents Peter and Delia 
Plunkett, from Greenfield, retired to 
France two years ago.

Since launching last week the blog - called When Grandparents Fly The Nest - has been shared widely on parenting websites and social media.

Harry, a pupil at Greenfield Primary School, said: 'I want to use the blog to talk about how it feels when someone close moves away.

'I want to share my feelings and find out how other people cope with missing people they love.

'It's not a place for doom and gloom, I want it to be upbeat, a place for positive talk about coping.'

The blog offers tips such as making ‘memory boxes' full of photos and souvenirs.

Harry explains: 'A
 memory box can be any box or container that you fill with photos and 
souvenirs that remind you of happy times with your absent relatives.

'In my box amongst other things, I have a bolt that I got from my Pop's workshop, a pine cone that I collected on a walk with grandma and a few photos of us all together.

'I also have a hand-written list of my top ten memories of things I have done with my Grandma and Pops.'Mum Alli-Jayne, a freelance journalist, who has another son, Mackenzie, nine, said: 'When they announced they were leaving we were all very proud.

Harry's mother recognises that grandparents are becoming more independent after retirement

'They had finished their job of raising the family and now was the right time for them to pursue the rest of their dreams.

'They were going to become shining 
examples to all of their friends and demonstrate that you were never too
 old for change and adventure, even if they didn't speak French.

'Two years on I still feel proud, but also strangely vulnerable without them by my side. I hadn't realised how much I relied on my parents before they left.

'Harry's blog has had an amazing reaction. Other parents in a similar situation are directing their children to the blog as a place they can share their feelings.

'It goes to show, long gone are the day grandparents stayed around to help with child care, more and more are taking their retirement as a chance to be independent again.'
