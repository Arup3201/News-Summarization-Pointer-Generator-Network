Cristiano Ronaldo will be hoping a change of scenery can bring about a change of fortune for the Portugal star as he trained with his international team-mates on Tuesday.

The 30-year-old was on the losing side for the third time in four matches on March 15 as his club side Real Madrid lost 2-1 at bitter rivals Barcelona.

The El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou leaves Real four points adrift of the Catalan table toppers with 10 games remaining in La Liga.

But despite this bitter blow, Ronaldo looked in a focused mood as he trained with his national side at their Lisbon base on Tuesday.

The forward will be hoping to lead his country to victory when they host Serbia in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday night, as well as adding to his tally of two goals in qualification so far.

Former Chelsea duo Tiago and Ricardo Carvalho both took part in Tuesday's session alongside fellow stalwarts Joao Moutinho and Nani.

Victory for Portugal on Sunday would stretch their gap over Serbia to eight points after four matches.

Fernando Santos' men currently sit second in Group I on six points - just one behind leaders Denmark who have played a game more. 

Santos will be hoping his side can continue their recent good form which has yielded an 100 per cent record from their last three games including a 1-0 friendly win over Argentina on November 18 at Old Trafford.

On Monday it was announced that the 60-year-old coach had won an appeal to cut his ban for misconduct at the World Cup while coaching Greece. However, he will still be barred from contact with his Portugal stars in their next few matches.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport said it halved an 'excessive' eight-match ban imposed by FIFA, with two matches of the sanction deferred for a six-month probationary period.

CAS added its panel found Santos guilty of 'improper conduct' during Greece's second-round loss to Costa Rica last June in Brazil.

Santos was sent from the dugout after extra time, which finished 1-1, as Greece lost the penalty shootout.

The court said Santos was 'protesting against the referee and casting doubts on his impartiality.'

After Serbia on Sunday, Portugal host the Cape Verde Islands in a friendly on March 31 before travelling to Armenia for their fifth Euro 2016 qualifier.
