An Avon lady peddling products door-to-door is a familiar sight. But now you might just find it’s a man standing on your door step offering up beauty tips.

According to new figures, the ‘Avon man’ is the newest phenomenon of the recession, as men turn to direct selling after losing their jobs because of the downturn.

There’s been a five per cent increase in representatives in just two years, with men making up a quarter of that number — a 26 per cent increase in three years.

Game changer: David Heffernan had more than 50 unsuccessful job interviews and now earns more as an Avon salesman than at his previous job in insurance

‘I knock on the door and say, “You clearly need this anti-wrinkle cream, do you want it?” And, bizarrely enough, that sales technique works,’ says David Heffernan, 39, from Knutsford, Cheshire, one of a growing number of unlikely beauty gurus.

‘When I was a child, I didn’t imagine I’d one day be selling lipsticks through letterboxes. I got a lot of raised eyebrows from customers when I started being an Avon man, but I enjoyed that surprise.

Brush up: It seems some of the new generation of Avon men may still need to brush up on some essential skills that ladies have down

‘At first, I didn’t have a clue about 
the products, but women seemed to like that naivety and now I use it to 
my advantage to help me sell.’

When he was made redundant from his job in insurance last March, David had more than 50 job interviews. None was successful.

‘I was on the scrapheap,’ he confesses. ‘Every day I looked at my two sons, knowing I was supposed to be making something of myself for them. I felt like a failure.’

David’s wife of seven years, Emma, was an Avon sales rep and asked him to help her out. They started door-to-door together and, six months later, were managing 70 other representatives.

David is now earning more than he used to in the insurance industry.

But while making inroads in a women’s world, it seems some of the new generation of Avon men may still need to brush up on some essential skills.

‘Demonstrating make-up is a bit beyond me,’ confesses David.

‘I make the pitches, but I’d lose  customers if I showed women how to apply foundation and mascara.

‘I can do an Adam Ant look, but that’s about it.’
