One of Afghanistan’s first woman MPs today revealed that she is no longer welcome in her own home, after escaping an abusive husband and a family who disowned her.

Noor Zia Atmar, 40, who was a politician from 2005 to 2010 but now lives in a shelter, added that progress in the country’s gender equality rights is falling apart as Western forces withdraw.

It comes after she served in the country’s first parliament following the Taliban's downfall - and got important legislation pushed through that banned more than 20 acts of violence against women.

Concerns: Noor Zia Atmar, 40, who was a politician from 2005 to 2010, now lives in a home for abused women after escaping from a husband who beat her and a family who disowned her after she divorced him

But she told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘Women are in a worse condition now. Every day they are being killed, having their ears, noses cut. It is not just women in villages - it is also people like me.’

Elections came in 2005 after the U.S. helped the country draft a new constitution which guaranteed big steps towards and gender equality - and that a quarter of the seats would be for women.

Miss Atmar carried out a strong campaign on a small budget - even selling a gold necklace to help - and was a much-praised member of parliament, making trips to India, France, Turkey and Britain.

Nato’s efforts to secure Afghanistan over the past 12 years have led to more girls entering education and making women more heard in the country - as well as a lowering of maternal mortality rates.

But the conservative society appears to be fighting back. It hopes women’s shelters will be closed, and the electoral law over women having at least a quarter of the seats has already been revised.

Voting: Afghan women line up as they wait to cast their ballots inside a polling centre in Kabul in August 2009. Elections also came in 2005 after the U.S. helped the country draft a new constitution

And attempts to approve a law drafted by Miss Atmar and others that set penalties for rape and child marriage - but was never ratified by parliament - were called off amid claims it was ‘un-Islamic’.

As Miss Atmar’s term came to an end she failed to win re-election and married a businessman, who was unimpressed by her campaign for women’s rights and refused to let her leave the house.

She told the newspaper: ‘He would get drunk and demand I remove his shoes. Then he would shout at me to put them back on, over and over. If I refused he would beat me. It was torture.’

Miss Atmar said that he once even banned her from using the phone - and that eventually she asked for a divorce. But, as would be expected in the society, her family severely frowned upon this.

‘They saw my face bruised, and scars from the knife - but they told me it was a traditional society, that I would bring shame on the family,’ she told the Sunday Telegraph.

They eventually abandoned her when she tried to get a lawyer, and she went to a shelter. Miss Atmar  contacted the British Embassy, but was told domestic abuse victims were not able to claim asylum.
