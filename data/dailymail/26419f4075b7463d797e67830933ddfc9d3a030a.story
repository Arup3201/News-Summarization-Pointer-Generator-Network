When Joseph Ford decided to merge his two passions for clothes and cameras his goal was to take the art of fashion photography to new heights.

So the Brighton-based photographer flew around the world to source landscapes for the 'aerial' project - before spending up to 12 hours painstakingly arranging designer garments to blend with his photographs.

His series includes leafy apartments in Mauritius paired with green-checkered Boss boxer shorts, while rips in a pair of jean blend with clouds over Sardinia.

Elsewhere a Sicilian train track blends seamlessly with a Barbour jacket zip and the rolling sands dunes of Morocco merge into the folds in a Kenzo sweater.

Joseph, 35, explains: 'I shot all the aerial images during a couple of advertising jobs in Sicily, Mauritius and Morocco, where I spent several days flying around over all sorts of terrain in a helicopter. I couldn't have done any of the pictures without the help of a couple of amazing helicopter pilots.

'I showed the aerial pictures to a couple of friends, Stephanie Buisseret (art director) and Mario Faundez (stylist) at a Paris streetwear magazine, and we came up with the idea of shooting a series mixing fashion and landscapes.

Buildings in Sicily matched with a Marc Ecko T-shirt: He said showed the images to two friends at a Paris streetwear magazine, and together they came up with the idea of shooting a series mixing fashion and landscapes

'That made an initial series of five doubles in 2012, which was selected for the Association of Photographers Awards in the UK and had an Honorable Mention in the International Photography Awards.

'A few months ago Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin got in touch and asked if I could produce another series along the same lines, with their stylist Almut Vogel.

'With both series, I made a selection of aerial images which I thought would lend itself well to the concept, and the stylists then made suggestions as to fashion items which they thought could match/contrast well.

No tricks: Joseph said there was no retouching of the 
images apart from 'a little tweaking of the colour balances to get the two 
sides to work well together'

'We made a shortlist together before the shoot, and spent a couple of days shooting the fashion in studio. Very long days - the image of the desert & a sweater took about 12 hours to produce, making tiny adjustments to the lighting and the position of the folds in the material to match it up to the patterns of light and dark in the sand dunes. There was a huge amount of trial and error to get the pictures to match up just right.

'There was no real retouching of the images, just a little tweaking of the colour balances to get the two sides to work well together. I shot almost everything with a medium format digital Hasselblad.'
