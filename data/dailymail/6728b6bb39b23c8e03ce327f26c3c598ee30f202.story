Manchester United are considering a £23million offer for Southampton left-back Luke Shaw following the completion of Juan Mata's £37m move from Chelsea.

A bid is set to go in over the weekend as United look to beat Chelsea to the 18-year-old's signature.

The deal for Mata is set to break their record transfer fee, £30.75million paid for Dimitar Berbatov in 2008, but David Moyes is hungry for more before the window shuts on January 31.

United are stepping up their efforts for Shaw as they foresee Chelsea making an offer for the Saints man in the summer.

Shaw has played 44 times in the Premier League for Southampton, and is yet to be capped by England due to competition from Cole and Everton left-back Leighton Baines.

Both United and Chelsea need long-term options at left-back, with some questions over the future of the Reds' Patrice Evra, 31, and England international Ashley Cole, 33.

Evra is in the final five months of 
his contract, and Moyes is already looking ahead for his replacement 
sooner rather than later.

Meanwhile, Cole is under pressure and has a fight on his hands to keep his starting place for Chelsea and England, but the man who is notorious for shunning interviews got his point across in a Nike ad last month.

Cole said in the ad: ‘Who you calling done? You think I’m done? I’m not done.

‘I’ve won seven FA Cups, three Premier League titles, 105 caps. I want 130. After 13 years at the top, I should be done. But I’m not done.

Moyes would most likely use Shaw straight away in his plans, rather than keep him on the sidelines before Evra leaves.
