The parents accused of beating their four-year-old son to death and burying him in a shallow grave treated his third-degree burns with honey and sought medical advice from the chiropractor instead of taking him to the ER, it emerged in court yesterday.

Nathan Sloop, 34, and his wife Stephanie, 30, from Farmington, Utah, have been charged with aggravated murder in the death of Ethan Stacey.

Today is the final day of the preliminary hearing in the shocking and brutal murder of Stephanie's son, whose body was found in a shallow grave in the mountains on May 11, 2010.

His face was beaten beyond recognition with a hammer, his body was burned and dog food was sprinkled over him. He had also been starved and bruised.

Innocent: Officials said Ethan suffered about 10 days worth of severe abuse, including starvation, burning and beatings

A judge will have to decide if there is enough evidence to send them to trial for the murder.

Defense attorneys presented their 
case yesterday and said that though the parents did not seek the right 
medical treatment, they did try to get help for the boy.

The evidence showed the Sloops had 
asked their chiropractor how to treat Ethan’s second-and third-degree 
burns, along with how to handle Ethan’s behavioral issues, according to 
the Salt Lake Tribune.

The chiropractor, who never examined 
Ethan, told them to put honey on the wounds and give the boy oregano oil
to control the behavioral issues.

Defense attorney Richard Mauro said:
'They thought that Ethan was sick. They believed that he was ill and 
they thought he had an allergy. They were giving him over-the-counter 
medications and they ended up harming him more than they were helping 
him.'

The court also heard yesterday about 
the amount of prescription medication that Nathan Sloop was taking in 
the months before Ethan died.

According to a Department of Professional Licensing document, which 
tracked all of the narcotics that Nathan Sloop was prescribed, he was 
given 4,146 pills in an 11-month period including Lortab, Valium, Percocet, an antihistamine and anxiety medication.

On Wednesday, court heard disturbing video recordings, phone calls and horrific messages about how the Sloops would allegedly treat Ethan and how they would have to 'break his ego'.

'I told you we had a pit bull on our hands, but they learn,' Sloop messaged Stephanie on May 3, 2010.

'Just like Mommy LOL,' she replied.

'I told you we had to break his ego,' Sloop texted.

Then on May 5 she wrote: 'He is broke that's for sure.'

Sloop replied they 'had to figure out how to keep him in his room'.

Both face capital murder and other charges in the boy's death.

Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against Sloop.

In addition to capital murder, the 
defendant also faces charges of obstructing justice and intentionally 
inflicting serious injury on a child, and desecration of a dead body, Desert News reported.

In court yesterday, prosecutor David 
Cole said it was Sloops' 'reckless indifference to human life' that 
caused the boy's death.

He said Ethan was scalded, beaten, over-medicated and not given the medical care that he needed.

The defense argues the boy was given too much Benadryl, Tylenol and decongestant and died from dehydration.

The court heard tapes wherein Sloop told police he would slap the child, make him stand with his nose against the wall and once pushed him into scalding water.

He also described a time when both he and Stephanie put feces into his mouth and said they never took him to hospital when he was sick.

'(Ethan) had seen things and heard things that a four-year-old boy should never see or hear,' he said.

The court also heard a jail-house 
phone call to his mother when Sloop called Ethan 'poison' that sunk his 
relationship with Stephanie Sloop 'like a battleship'.

He
also said the boy was disobedient and misbehaved, often sneaking from 
his room and turning on video games or going to the refrigerator.

Layton
Police Sgt Jeff Roderick reported that there were traces of blood found
on the wall of Ethan's room, believed to be from the boy's nose rubbing
against the wall.

In a 
short video shown to the court, Ethan can be seen looking dishevelled 
with some redness on his cheek. He says to the camera: 'I'm having fun 
with Nathan. He's not scary anymore.'

In
an audio recording also played in court, Nathan Sloop can be heard 
asking Ethan numerous times whether he wanted to stay in Utah or return 
to live with his father in Virginia. He repeatedly asked the boy if his 
father was mean or hurt him.

'Where do you want to live?' Sloop asked.

Through tears and wheezing, Ethan croaks back: 'My mom, my mom, my mom.'

Sloop
pleaded not guilty to the charges last year. Asked if they would 
consider a plea deal, Sloop's attorney, Richard Mauro, said that they 
are just preparing for the preliminary hearings and waiting to see what 
the prosecution presents as evidence.

Mauro said he plans to challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty as part of a series of motions he'll file.

Sloop's
wife, Stephanie Sloop, 30, faces identical charges for contributing to 
her son's death or failing to stop it, but it remains unknown whether or
not the prosecutors will seek the death penalty for her. She is due 
back in court April12.

Two of a kind: Nathan Sloop, left, and his wife and Ethan's biological mother, Stephanie Sloop, right, reported the boy missing a day before his disfigured and burned body was discovered in a shallow grave near a ski resort 

Heart-breaking: The Sloops allegedly left the little boy beaten and locked up at home while they went to get married in May 2010

Investigators say that on the day of Nathan and Stephanie Sloop's wedding May 6, the child was locked in an apartment bedroom on his own because the couple feared people would call police if they saw the toddler's injuries.

Following her arrest, Stephanie Sloop told police that on May 7, 2010, she got a call from her husband saying that her son had burned himself while taking a bath, according to CBS News.

When the mother reached home, probable cause documents state she found Ethan with severe burns to his feet and along the back of his legs. She also noticed what she described as human feces in the four-year-old's mouth.

Mrs Sloop told police that she did not seek medical help for her injured son because she was afraid that Nathan Sloop would harm her if she tried to do so.

On Mother's Day, May 10, 2010, Stephanie and Nathan Sloop reported the boy missing after discovering that Ethan had died, according to prosecutors. The Sloops told police that the toddler wandered out of the apartment in Layton.

However, the following evening, the child's remains were discovered wrapped in plastic and dumped in a shallow grave near Powder Mountain in Weber County.

The four-year-old's face was severely disfigured, and there was dog food sprinkled on his grave.
