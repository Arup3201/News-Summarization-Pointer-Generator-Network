Accusations: Intimate details of the early life of Spain's Princess Letizia are set to be revealed in a new book

Spain's royal family faces fresh embarrassment as a new book accuses the wife of the heir to the throne of covering up an abortion.

The book about Princess Letizia was written by her cousin David 
Rocasolano, and includes intimate information about her life before she married Crown Prince Felipe in 2004.

It claims Princess Letizia allegedly had an abortion in 2002 - before she met the Crown Prince - and that she tried to cover this up before her engagement was announced, the Telegraph reports.

Princess Letizia, a former newsreader and divorcee, allegedly asked for paperwork detailing the abortion to be destroyed, according to the book.

Mr
Rocasolano said he was asked by the Princess and Prince Felipe to carry out the task.

The abortion is alleged to have taken place at a time when terminations were still illegal in Spain - unless
there was abnormality or the mother's life or mental well being were significantly threatened.

It comes at a difficult time for the 
royal family after Princess Cristina - Crown Prince Felipe's sister - 
was made a suspect in a fraud case.

The book, called 'Adios Princesa,â€™ is believed to portray the Princess as an 'obsessive' person who is suspicious of her relatives.

It claims the Princess, 40, thought one of her family had been leaking stories about her to the press and that she told some of them she was pregnant with a boy in 2005 - when she was actually pregnant with a girl - to test this out, according to the Telegraph.

Princess Letizia was criticized by some in Spain when she married Crown Prince Felipe as she was a divorcee and a commoner.

Demands have been made for an investigation into the allegations - which could further damage the royal family's public image. A spokesman for the family said it had no comment to make on the book.

Princess Cristina, 47 - one of King Juan Carlos's three children - will be called in for questioning later this month, a court in Palma de Mallorca has announced.

She
will be quizzed over claims her husband Inaki Urdangarin, 45, and his 
former business partner Diego Torres, 47, embezzled cash from public 
funds.

Support for having a monarchy in Spain has fallen to a historic low of 54 per cent, according to a poll published in January, the Telegraph reports.
