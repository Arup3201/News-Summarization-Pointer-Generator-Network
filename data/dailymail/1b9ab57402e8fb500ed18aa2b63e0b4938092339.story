Prime Minister Tony Abbott has released the G20's final plan for economic growth, pledging to work with world leaders to deliver real outcomes.

In his final address as G20 chair, Mr Abbott on Sunday thanked world leaders for attending the most influential gathering of world leaders in Australian history.

He said there had been a strong spirit of cooperation and moments of candour between the leaders, and a commitment to actually implement their 'action plan'.

'We have published these growth strategies so the world can see what we are committed to and the world can hold us to account,' he told reporters in Brisbane.

'People right around the world are going to be better off and that's what it's all about.'

The overarching G20 goal was to boost global economic growth by 2.1 per cent by 2018, which if translated would add $2 trillion to economic activity. 

Barely had the official G20 summary been released, the leaders were already dashing home, with US President Barack Obama in the air after the summit wrapped up on Sunday.

President Obama was spotted boarding his helicopter Marine One at Victoria Park in Bowen Hill before arriving at RAAF Base Amberley, south-west of Brisbane on the outskirts of Ipswich to board his Air Force One plane home.

While Russian President Vladimir Putin didn't even hang around that long, citing the need to get back to Moscow and catch up on his sleep as he headed to the special G20 airport in Brisbane before proceedings had even finished.

Meanwhile, Mr Abbott said in his final statement that a working session on trade, which he described as one of the most productive of this G20 weekend, had delivered a unanimous agreement that expanding global trade would directly benefit countries and people right around the world.

'Trade is a key driver of growth, perhaps the key driver of growth, and we're focused on domestic reforms to facilitate trade as well as the importance of a strong global trading system.'

He also said a global infrastructure hub would be launched in Sydney as part of a wider initiative to address a global $70 trillion gap in infrastructure by 2030.

It would be funded by government and private sector contributions, he said.

Energy ministers would meet for the first time early next year to take work forward on a G20 energy efficiency action plan, Mr Abbott said.

'Energy I'm pleased to say is now at the heart of the G20's agenda,' he said.

The communique from the Brisbane summit also included specific mention of climate change.

Mr Abbott said all leaders had voiced support for strong and effective action to address climate change.

'Our actions will support sustainable development, economic growth and certainty for business and investment and, of course, we will all work constructively towards the climate change conference in Paris next year.'

The G20 leaders committed backed a global crackdown on tax avoidance by multinational companies.

'If banks get into trouble taxpayers should not be bailing them out,' Mr Abbott said.

'And big business must pay its fair share of tax and it must pay its fair share of tax in the jurisdiction where they earned the profits.'

It was put to Mr Abbott that there had been some disagreement among leaders on the extent to which climate change featured in the communique, and that US President Barack Obama had argued strongly against the prime minister's position on the use of fossil fuels.

'As for coal, without going into the details of who said what to whom and exactly what intervention was about what subject, I should remind everyone that right now there are 1.3 billion people right around the globe who have no access whatsoever to electricity,' Mr Abbott said.

'And not only was the communique drafting process constructive and collegial but the discussion in the room today was very constructive and collegial.

'I just want to make that absolutely crystal clear, that from the very beginning, climate change was in the draft communique.'

The prime minister said labour market reforms were also crucial, of which lifting female participation was the 'principal commitment'.

He said that if female participation was closer to male participation in every country of the G20, 'billions if not trillions of dollars in additional growth' would be unlocked.

Meanwhile, Brisbanites will soon get their city back as the riot fences are removed and special laws that made it illegal to carry reptiles on some streets expire.

Police declared it a triumph, with no major incidents reported from the 6000 officers deployed to patrol the often empty streets in the city's CBD and south bank areas.

The mercury soared, with snipers atop Brisbane rooftops reporting extreme temperatures beyond 60 degrees Celsius.

Protests were numerous, colourful, but peaceful.

Inside the giant Brisbane convention centre, 3000 journalists from across the globe bunkered down to cover the G20 proceedings.

In the end the business side of the two-day spectacle was distilled into an unassuming three-page communique.

G20 leaders - the heads of the world's largest developed and emerging economies - pledged to do their bit to grow the global pie.

The overarching goal is to achieve more than two per cent economic growth in the bloc above business as usual by 2018.

The real test will be whether countries come good on their promises, but that's really for the next G20 host - Turkey - to oversee.

There were also commitments to crackdown on tax avoidance, bolster financial markets from shocks and shore up the banks deemed 'too big to fail'.

But despite the Abbott government's wish for a narrow agenda under its G20 presidency, there was much more to the G20 than just jobs and growth.

Climate change and the Ebola outbreak were hot topics, dominating talks on the sidelines of the main event.

Other highlights were the 'family' photo of G20 leaders - a potentially tense diplomatic exercise - and the awkward hand gestures shared by Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Mr Putin.

The mantle now gets passed to Turkey, who assumes the G20 presidency in December and will host next year's leaders' meeting.

For Australia, the fun and games continues.

Indian president Narendra Modi, Chinese president Xi Jinping, French president Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will hang around a few days for non-G20 events.

Mr Modi and Mr Xi will have the honour of addressing federal parliament in Canberra this week.
