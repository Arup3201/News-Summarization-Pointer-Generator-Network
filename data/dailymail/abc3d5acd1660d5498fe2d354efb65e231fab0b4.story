Mourners were today demanding justice for an atheist blogger hacked to death by Islamists in Dhaka over his opposition to religious extremism.

Hundreds of mourners gathered around the coffin of Avijit Roy, a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, after he was murdered in the street last week on his way home from a book fair.

His wife and fellow blogger, Rafida Ahmed, remains in hospital in a serious condition after she suffered head injuries and lost a finger in the attack.

The murder of Mr Roy, an atheist who advocated secularism in Bangladesh, came amid a crackdown on the country's Islamist groups after they increased their activities in recent years.

A resident of Atlanta, Georgia, Mr Roy came to visit Dhaka, the city of his birth, in the middle of last month and had been due to soon return home.

Today mourners carried flowers to his coffin at Dhaka University to pay their respects.

'Free thinking in Bangladesh is become a great danger, all the free thinkers are at great risk,' writer Shahriar Kabir told Reuters.

'We want to know why the government failed to ensure the safety of him, despite knowing that he had been facing threats from the Islamist radicals.'

As Mr Roy's father stood by, Kamal Hossain, the architect of Bangladesh's secular constitution, called the killing 'a heinous murder'.

'My question is, why did it take place?' said Mr Hossain. 'Avijit was killed because of his writing. By killing him, the killers have torn apart our constitution.' 

No arrest has so far been made. People also held a demonstration at the spot where he was killed and chanted slogans demanding 'immediate arrest and quick trial of the perpetrator'.

Mr Roy's family said Islamist radicals had threatened him over his blog, 'Mukto-mona,' or 'Freemind,' that highlighted humanist and rationalist ideas and condemned religious extremism.

The naturalised U.S. citizen, who was a bio-engineer as well as a blogger, had been receiving death threats online for years. Mr Roy and his wife have a daughter at university in the U.S. 

Ajoy Roy stood alongside his son's coffin as mourners filed past.

He reiterated that Islamist militants were responsible for his son's death, but also blamed the government for failing to protect him despite repeated threats on his life.

'I am speechless at this moment of mourning. When the fundamentalists threatened, I informed the Inspector General of Police and Deputy Inspector General of Police,' Ajoy Roy said.

'This murder has proved their utter failure.'

An obscure militant group, Ansar Bangla 7, claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said was in retaliation for his 'crime against Islam'.

The extremists also said he was singled out because he is a U.S. citizen - and characterized the vicious killing as 'revenge' for attacks on ISIS in Syria.

Police said at least two men, who are believed to have links to Dhaka University, attacked Roy around 8.45pm on Thursday, landing three strong, deliberate blows to the right side of his head with machetes.

They turned on his wife, Rafida Ahmed, when she tried to save him, then fled into the crowd, dumping their weapons as they ran.

Police have expressed shock that extremists struck at a university book fair, which was heavily guarded.

Witnesses have even said officers and bystanders were there during the murder - but did nothing.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called it 'a shocking act of violence' that was 'horrific in its brutality and cowardice'.

Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of free speech campaign group Index on Censorship said: 'Our sympathies are with the family of Avijit Roy.

'Roy was targeted simply for expressing his own beliefs and we are appalled by his death and condemn all such killings.'

Bloodbath: The scene immediately following the attack on the couple. An obscure militant group, Ansar Bangla 7, claimed responsibility for the attack it said was in retaliation for his 'crime against Islam'

In 2013, religious extremists targeted several secular bloggers who had demanded capital punishment for Islamist leaders convicted of war crimes during Bangladesh's war for independence.

Blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider was killed that year in a similar attack near his home in Dhaka after he led one such protest demanding capital punishment.

In 2004, Humayun Azad, a secular writer and professor at Dhaka University, was also attacked by militants while returning home from a Dhaka book fair. He later died in Germany while undergoing treatment.

Media group Reporters Without Borders rated Bangladesh 146th among 180 countries in a ranking of press freedom last year.
