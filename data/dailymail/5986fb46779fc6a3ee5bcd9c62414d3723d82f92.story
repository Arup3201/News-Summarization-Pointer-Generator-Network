A woman and her two sons died Wednesday from apparent gunshot wounds in what police suspect was a murder-suicide in southwestern Ohio.

Rachel Johnson, 32, and Daylan Johnson, 7, were dead at their home when her estranged husband called police shortly before 8 a.m., Springfield Police Chief Stephen Moody said. Ayden Johnson, 10, was taken to a hospital, where he later died.

The preliminary investigation indicates that the woman shot the boys and took her own life, Moody said. He revealed that she and her husband Arthur Johnson, 39, were separated but still parenting together.

Arthur Johnson had gone to the home to pick up his sons and take them to school when he found his wife and sons, Moody said.

He called 911 and said there were 'wedding pictures all over the floor' at the scene, according to WHIO.

The couple's first wedding anniversary was less than two weeks away, WDTN revealed.   

Moody said the woman and her sons all had gunshot wounds, but the Clark County coroner would determine the cause of death.

'When there are children involved, it's always close to all of our hearts,' Moody told WHIO. 

'The community needs to understand that this is an isolated incident ...,' he continued. 'The community is safe. This is a hard-working neighborhood.'

The police chief in the city about an hour-and-a-half drive northeast of Cincinnati said no additional information on any possible motive was available.

The two boys attended Warder Park/Wayne Elementary School, and the superintendent of the Springfield City School District said a team of psychologists and counselors were at the school on Wednesday to provide support to children, staff and parents.

Superintendent David Estrop said Ayden Johnson was in the fourth grade and Daylan was in the second grade.

'They had many friends here,' said Estrop.

Former neighbor Vicki Green told WHIO, ''This is a shock because you never see any kind of depression out of her.

'She's always smiling, always smiling. So I don't know. I have no idea why this would happen or why she would do anything like this.'
