The Obamas, pictured last week, spoke candidly in an interview about their experiences of racism 

The Obamas revealed their first-hand encounters with racism as they spoke candidly about tough questions America is facing over race.

The President and First Lady recalled a time when Barack was handed car keys to fetch the vehicle at valet-parking, while he waited outside a restaurant after dinner.

In a joint interview, Michelle Obama told People this month that prior to holding the most powerful position in the U.S., her husband faced his share of prejudice.

She said: 'Before that, Barack Obama was a black man that lived on the South Side of Chicago, who had his share of troubles catching cabs.'

She said that even when she went to Target as First Lady, a fellow shopper had asked her to get something from a shelf.

Mrs Obama said: 'Even as the First Lady - during that wonderfully publicized trip I took to Target, not highly disguised, the only person who came up to me in the store was a woman who asked me to help her take something off a shelf.' 

She added: 'These incidents in the black community, this is the regular course of life. These are the challenges that we still face as a country.' 

Of her husband, Mrs Obama added that during one event: 'He was wearing a tuxedo at a black-tie dinner, and somebody asked him to get coffee.'

The President said racial relations have gotten better, but more progress is needed.

'The small irritations or indignities that we experience are nothing compared to what a previous generation experienced,' Obama said. 

'It's one thing for me to be mistaken for a waiter at a gala. 

'It's another thing for my son to be mistaken for a robber and to be handcuffed, or worse, if he happens to be walking down the street and is dressed the way teenagers dress.'

The Obamas' remarks follow months of tense protests across the country as America faces up to burning questions about race relations following the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Eric Garner in New York at the hands of the police.

The President said basketball superstar LeBron James did the right thing when he wore an 'I can't breathe' T-shirt - referring to the chokehold death of Mr Garner - on to the court. 

He told People: 'I think LeBron did the right thing. We forget the role that Muhammad Ali, Arthur Ashe and Bill Russell played in raising consciousness.

'I'd like to see more athletes do that - not just around this issue, but around a range of issues.'

Following the death of Michael Brown, a black teen who was unarmed when shot dead by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri, Obama met with young people from the area.

He told them to express in peaceful ways what was going on in their lives - but cautioned them not to think all problems could be solved in the short-term.

The Obamas said now their daughters, Malia, 16, and 13-year-old Sasha were older, the family were able to discuss more difficult questions facing the African-American community.

Mrs Obama said: 'When you're raising black kids you have to talk about these issues, because they're real.' 

The President said they try to get Malia and Sasha to reflect on stereotypes, particularly on 'how they think they should have to act as African-American girls'.

He added that following the cases of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin: 'Around the dinner table we're pointing out to them that too often in our society black boys are still perceived as more dangerous, and it will be part of their generation's task to try to eradicate those stereotypes.' 

The President also spoke about his feelings of nostalgia about Christmases past now that their daughters are teens.

The President told People: 'Kids don't want toys now. They want iTunes cards.' 

The Obamas also shared intimate moments from White House life - including a secret dance party that took place in the Yellow Oval Room.

On one recent Friday evening when the Obamas had a small group of friends over, Barack acted as DJ and they cranked the music up in a room that is more used to hosting visiting royal dignitaries. 

Obama shared his top playlist for getting people on the dance floor with People magazine. 

'We started with Aretha’s Rock Steady. Sly and the Family Stone.' the President said. 'Then we ended the night on Al Green, and everybody did a slow dance.'

The first couple's love of music and dancing is well-known, and while the commander-in-chief may only be spinning the decks behind closed doors, he was recently seen grooving with Santa Claus at the lighting of the National Christmas tree in D.C.  

The interviews comes just a few days before the Obamas are set to jet off on their annual vacation to Hawaii for almost three weeks.

The first family will leave Washington, D.C. on Friday for the President's native state and won't return until January 4, the White House said.  

It is not yet known where they stay this year, though they have traditionally rented out a property on Oahu island.
