Britons travelling abroad are warned to brace themselves to have less cash in their pockets as the value of the pound tumbled.

Sterling crashed to its lowest level for more than a year against the euro and to a five-month low against the US dollar as its ‘abysmal’ start to the year continued.

The pound has lost more than 5 per cent of its value against the  single currency since New Year’s Day – putting it on course for its worst month since 2008.

Holidaymakers will feel the pinch after the pound fell to 1.16 euros - its lowest level since 2011

The pound fell to 1.16 euros – its lowest level since 2011 – before clawing back some of its losses. It was trading above 1.23 euros early this month and close to 1.29 euros as recently as July. Tonight it closed at 1.17 euros.

The pound has not fallen so sharply in a month since December 2008 in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers.

William Poole, a strategist at currency broker FC Exchange, said: ‘The pound is truly having an abysmal start to the year.’

Roberto Mialich, a currency strategist at UniCredit, added: ‘Economic reports out of the UK, especially the GDP data, have not looked very encouraging. The pound is likely to remain under pressure.’

Despite the slump in the pound, the 
FTSE 100 above 6300 for the first time in more than four-and-a-half years today as progress by heavyweight stocks helped keep up the New Year rally.

The FTSE 100 Index was able to build on its best start to a year in more than two decades, closing up 44.8 points to 6339.2, after strong performances from BP, Centrica and Rio Tinto.

Experts said it was boosted in part 
by better-than-expected results for US sales of long-lasting durable 
goods, up 4.6 per cent in December including orders for commercial and 
military aircraft.

The index of 100 leading companies on
 the London stock exchange has risen steadily since the start of the 
year, when US President Barack Obama clinched a budget deal to avoid the
 so-called 'fiscal cliff' of tax rises and deep spending cuts.

The
 FTSE performance will be a welcome boost for Chancellor George Osborne 
who yesterday warned Britain 'faces a difficult economic situation' as 
he refused to alter his austerity programme, despite warnings it could 
be damaging prospects of growth.

Prime Minister David Cameron chaired a regional cabinet meeting in Leeds yesterday, designed to show the government has a plan to get the whole economy moving

Mr Osborne told BBC Breakfast: 'We’ve got problems at home, with our unbalanced economy, the problems in our financial services, the debts we’ve build up, and frankly we’ve got problems aboard with many of our export markets deep in recession in Europe.

'We’ve got to confront those problems and we’ve got to do those things in the short term that will help, and we are investing in apprenticeships.'

He later addressed a special Cabinet meeting in Leeds when he warned that the growth figures were 'a reminder that the British economy continues to face a difficult economic situation'.

David Cameron took ministers to Yorkshire to publicise the announcement of the route for High Speed trains linking Birmingham with Manchester and Leeds.

The PM said the line was needed to help Britain compete on the world stage.

'I think it is one of the best answers to healing the North-South divide, to bringing growth to our great northern cities,' he told the BBC.

The Chancellor told BBC Breakfast that Britain faces 'a difficult economic situation' but refused to abandon his austerity programme

'If you look at the big motorways that were put in place, the big railway developments that have been put in place, they have been very effective at driving economic growth by linking up our cities.

'You mention Germany but most countries are getting onboard the high speed rail express. In Japan they did it years ago. France, Spain, others and I think we should be doing it too.

'It’s not just about the journey times between the cities. It’s also the massive extra capacity it releases for other services.'

Mr Osborne said HS2 would be an 'engine for growth' in the North as he insisted Britain cannot 'run away from the hard choices it faces' on the economy.

The Chancellor rebuffed calls  to change course after latest growth figures show the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the last quarter of 2012.

Traders broke the FTSE 100 record which has stood since May 2008, despite gloomy economic news in Britain

IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard last week said the Chancellor should 'take stock' in his March Budget and London Mayor Boris Johnson has urged Mr Osborne to 'junk the rhetoric of austerity' to restore confidence in the economy.

But Mr Osborne insisted he would not change his deficit-reduction strategy. 'Britain faces a difficult economic situation,' he told BBC Breakfast.

'We have got problems at home, built up by this unbalanced economy, problems in our financial sector and the debts we have built up. And, frankly, we have got problems abroad with many of our export markets deep in recession in Europe.

'We have got to do the things in the short term that will help - and we are investing in apprenticeships, unemployment is falling at the moment. In the end, Britain can't run away from the hard choices it faces.

'We have got to invest in our future, we have got to keep up with other countries who are making all sorts of investments in their economies, and we have got to deal with our debts because, in the end, if people don't believe you are going to pay your way in the world, nothing is going to be invested in.'
