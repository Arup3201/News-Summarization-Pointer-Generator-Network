Two workers at Papa John's have been fired after 'butt-dialling' a customer's cell phone and unwittingly leaving a voicemail message, filled with racial slurs.

The two employees are believed to have been delivery drivers who worked at a store in Sanford, Orlando.

In a YouTube video - including audio of the message - the workers can be heard talking about a tip from a customer and then singing and laughing while repeatedly using a racist slur.

Two workers at Papa John's pizza chain in America have been fired after accidentally leaving a voicemail message on a customer's mobile phone, filled with racial slurs. Pictured is a Sanford store in Orlando, Florida

In a YouTube video - including audio of the message - the workers can be heard talking about a tip from a customer and then singing and laughing while repeatedly using a racist slur

One of the men can be heard saying: 'Did he tip you? While the other replies: 'Nope not at all.'

The
first man then says: 'I guess that's the only requirement for being a N***** in Sanford.

'Yeah they give me five bucks. They're fine outstanding African American 
gentlemen of the community', WKMG Local6 reports.

Papa John's Pizza Chairman and CEO John Schnatter posted an apology on the chain's Facebook site

Two men can then be heard singing a version of an operatic number from The Marriage of Figaro 
by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but repeatedly use a racial slur instead of 
the actual lyric.

The customer then displays a Papa John's delivery-box receipt for a pizza 
costing $15.26, including a delivery charge. He said he had left a 21
per cent tip.

The video then showed the customer's mobile phone, listing calls and voice
mail messages, including a missed call from the deliveryman.

It is believed the two men had not meant to call the customer, a mistake which has been coined 'butt-dialing'.

Papa John's Pizza Chairman and CEO John Schnatter posted an apology on the chain's Facebook site.

He said that the two employees had been sacked.

He wrote: 'Friends, I am extremely concerned to learn about the reprehensible 
language used by two former employees in one of our restaurants.

'Their 
thinking and actions defy both my personal and the company's values, and
everything for which this company stands.

'The employees responsible for
this absolutely unacceptable behavior were immediately terminated.

'My heartfelt apology goes out to the customer involved, his family, and 
our community at large.

'I am very sorry that anyone would be exposed to 
these hurtful and painful words by any person involved in any way with 
our company.

'Thank you for your important comments. I have personally reached out to 
our customer to share my own thoughts and offer my deepest apology.'
