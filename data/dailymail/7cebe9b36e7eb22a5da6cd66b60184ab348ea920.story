A row has broken out in a Lidl supermarket where Polish workers were told to stop speaking their native language and address customers in English.

Staff at the store in Kirkcaldy, Fife, say they were banned from conversing in Polish during their breaks and told to only speak English on the shop floor.

But workers have hit back at bosses - insisting many of their customers only speak Polish and do not understand English.

Lidl in Kirkcaldy, Fife is at the centre of a row after Polish workers hit out at being told to speak English

One member of staff, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'I tried to explain to the manager that many customers who do not speak English correctly come to our shop because they know there is a Polish service at the cash desk, bakery and shop floor as well.

'The manager became irritated and told me to carry out his orders.'

The worker said they were told they'd be sent home if they were heard speaking their own language again.

The worker added: 'I have been living Scotland for nearly 10 years and I have never experienced any kind of discrimination.

'It is very sad to be forced to be forced to speak English to people who do not understand it and feel confused as they expect to be served in Polish.'

The issue has sparked a row in the Scottish town, which has a large Polish community and recently hosted its own festival of Polish culture.

A petition at 'The Polish Shop' in the town's High Street has gathered 100 signatures and Lidl workers intend to forward it to the firm's European headquarters in Germany.

The store insists it is company policy that all staff speak English 'for the benefit of all customers'

One Polish customer, 35, said: 'I think this is one of the most ridiculous ideas I have ever heard in my life.

'I cannot imagine an opposite situation, where a British worker is not allowed to speak to a British customer in the English language anywhere in Europe.'

A Lidl spokesman said: 'We understand that in certain regions of the UK there are other official languages in use and we welcome the use of these in our stores.

'We also ask that, if possible, our staff respond to customers in the language in which they are addressed.

'We do have a general policy in the UK stating that we carry out our working communication in English, such as when speaking to fellow employees on the shop floor. 

'As a business we have to have this in place to help reduce misunderstandings and encourage the building of good relationships across the business and with customers. 

'Whilst staff are on their break, they are of course welcome to converse in their language of choice.

'We only ask that they consider their colleagues who may be sharing rest facilities at the same time.'
