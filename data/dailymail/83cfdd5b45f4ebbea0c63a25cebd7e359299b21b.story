It sounds like the plot of a science fiction film, but US researchers have revealed an audacious plan to blow up asteroid approaching Earth with nuclear weapons.

The Iowa team outlined their vision at a Nasa conference, and say they would need just a weeks notice to launch if the system were developed.

It sends a small projectile to create a crater on the asteroid surface, then milliseconds later a nuclear warhead which detonates inside it.

How it would work: The HAIV system sends a small projectile to create a crater on the asteroid surface, then milliseconds later a nuclear warhead which detonates inside it.

Called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle, or HAIV, the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep space.It consists of a fore body (a leader spacecraft), which would hit the comet and create blast crater.

Around a millisecond later, an aft body (a follower spacecraft) carrying nuclear explosives would hit inside the crater - which increases its effectiveness by up to 20 times.

'We have the solution, using our baseline concept, to be able to mitigate the asteroid-impact threat, with any range of warning,' Bong Wie, of Iowa State University at the 2014 NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) meeting at Stanford University, according to space.com.

He said the previously undetected 65-foot-wide (20 meters) space rock that detonated in the skies above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk, injuring 1,500 people a year ago has helped the cause to create asteroid busting technologies.

'A couple of years ago, I had to use the dinosaur example to justify our research,' he said, referring to the asteroid impact that wiped out the giant reptiles 65 million years ago.

'Now, that's no more â€” we had this major event.'

Nasa has previously backed the project.

'Despite the uncertainties inherent to the nuclear disruption approach, disruption can become an effective strategy if most fragments disperse at speeds in excess of the escape velocity of an asteroid so that a very small number of fragments impacts the Earth,' Nasa said.

Experts say the project could be ready within a week - and would launch 24 hours before detonation occured

'It offers a potential breakthrough or great leap in mission capabilities for mitigating the impact threat of near-Earth objects.'

Called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle, or HAIV, the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep space.

'The proposed HAIV system consists of a fore body (a leader spacecraft) to provide proper kinetic-energy impact crater conditions for an aft body (a follower spacecraft) carrying nuclear explosives,' explained Nasa.

Detonating the bomb inside a crater increases its effectiveness by 20 times, the team believes.

The nuclear bomb would follow one millisecond behind, hopefully shattered the asteroid.

Each mission would cost around $500m, it is believed.
