Detroit is planning a new push to auction city-owned homes online as part of an effort to fight blight.

Mayor Mike Duggan and the Detroit Land Bank Authority on Monday afternoon announced a new auction website that's designed to get homes into the hands of people who will quickly fix them.

The site has launched with 15 homes up for auction at Building Detroit. A community meeting about the effort will be held Monday night.

Big plans: Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan is carrying out an initiative to revitalize neighborhoods of the struggling city

Duggan said that the city will post legal notices on empty houses and take court action if needed against owners of blighted properties in one northwest side neighborhood. It's part of Duggan's revitalization program for the bankrupt city.

Detroit has been working for years to deal with vacant and dangerous buildings, often by demolishing them.

Last week, Duggan announced a program for revitalizing neighborhoods by rebuilding and refurbishing homes.

Urban renewal: The city will auction any homes that are salvageable to buyers who will renovate and repair them

Owners of uninhabited and dilapidated homes will be put on notice that their homes will be seized through legal action unless they begin work to fix them.

Any homes that are salvageable will be auctioned.

'This is a historic change in Detroitâ€™s strategy in fighting blight,' Duggan said last week.

'We are getting away from this mindless process of demolishing everything thatâ€™s vacant. Whatâ€™s different is we are attacking the entire neighborhood at once.'

The city is planning 'an extensive marketing campaign' to drum up interest in the auction.

The auction is 'designed to get homes into hands of those who will fix them up quickly,' according to a press release.

Duggan's program is modeled after a similar project he ran as the Wayne County prosecutor from 2001 to 2003, reports the Detroit News.

That initiative saw 1,000 homes fixed up.
