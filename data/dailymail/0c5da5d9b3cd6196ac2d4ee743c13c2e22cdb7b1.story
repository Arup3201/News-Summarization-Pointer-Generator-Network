A hilarious YouTube video clip showing four men forming a 'human bicyle' on an airport travelator has gone viral with more than half a million hits in under a week.

Billed as 'four bored Scousers at Manchester Airport', the 17-second clip starts with a general view of a moving walkway. Half way through, four men appear, with one on his back and using his hands as ‘pedals’, one at the front as ‘handlebars’, one bent over as the ‘seat’ and one on top as the ‘cyclist’.

But the clip, which has been shared by celebrities including Scouse comic John Bishop, may not be all as it seems. Eagle-eyed viewers have noticed the footage isn't filmed in England at all - and the men involved may not even be from Liverpool.

The 'bored Scousers' begin their unconventional journey down what is supposedly as Manchester Airport travelator

But users have cast doubt on the true origins of the men, with some saying they are actually from the Czech Republic

YouTube user Sidisek wrote in the comments section below the video: 'They speak Czech - I know because I am Czech.'

Airport
sources said the home-made movie was actually shot at Prague or 
Budapest Airport, although the passengers may have been booked on a 
flight to Manchester.

Despite
doubts over the origin of the jokers, Scousers left comments in their 
droves. Mikesep wrote it 'made him proud to be a Scouser', while Tyrone 
Waldrin said: 'I'm a Cockney from London and I've got to say I love the 
Scousers, proper salt of the earth people, great banter.'

Dubious YouTube viewers are also sceptical the clip was filmed in Manchester, with some suggesting Budapest was the real location

Connor1996 reckons Liverpudlians have 'the best humour they're the funniest people around', while Rezza6 said the video was the 'best thing the Scousers have produced in years'.

The video hasn't impressed everyone though, with a spokesman for Manchester Airport only offering the faintest of praise.

'We can think of better ways to entertain yourself while waiting in the terminals for an aircraft.' said the spokesman.

'They’ve demonstrated an interesting approach to innovation, however, with their bicycle design but it’s not something we would recommend on a moving walkway. Perhaps a play area would be more suitable.'
