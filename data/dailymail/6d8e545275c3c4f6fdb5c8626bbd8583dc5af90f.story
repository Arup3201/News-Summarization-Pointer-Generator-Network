A four-year-old boy has tragically died after climbing into a boiling-hot car during a heatwave on Tuesday.

Cyller Nelson was discovered soon after his family reported him missing at the Pine Oaks Mobile Home Park in Mobile, Alabama around 2.15pm.

A neighbor reported hearing his mother screaming as a man tried desperately to revive the little boy. Paramedics pronounced the four-year-old dead at the scene.

Accidental: It is not expected that criminal charges will be filed after the little boy wandered off from his home on Tuesday afternoon

Temperatures in Mobile registered at 91F
on Tuesday but authorities said the temperature in the car would have soared to more than 100F. 

A neighbor told examiner.com that Cyller was at home with his mother Heather Queysen and his newborn baby sister while his father Chris Robare was at work.

No criminal charges are expected to be filed as the death is thought to be accidental after the little boy wandered away from his home.

Neighbor Tonya Smith told Fox 10: 'It’s very tragic. There’s another angel in heaven now, one that didn't need to be there, he just started his life.'

According to website KidsandCars.org, 32
children were killed in the U.S. last year when they were left in hot 
cars. The number of tragedies this year stands at 21 in the U.S. and two
in Canada.

An eight-month-old boy in Virginia died on July 5 after being left in a car all day by his mother in temperatures reaching 90F.

The woman told police she had forgotten her child was in the car when she drove to work in Arlington last Friday.

When
she left work that afternoon she discovered her son in the car and 
drove him to INOVA Alexandria Hospital around 4pm, according to 
NBCWashington.

The child was pronounced dead at the hospital.

A
similar tragedy happened on the same day in Baltimore where a 
16-month-old girl died when a relative forgot her in his truck when he 
went to take a nap.

He was meant to drop the child off at daycare but drove home instead.

Four
hours later he got into his vehicle and drove to the Head Start centre 
to pick up the girl, but when he was told the child had not been dropped
off, he discovered her unresponsive in his truck. She was pronounced dead at the hospital.
