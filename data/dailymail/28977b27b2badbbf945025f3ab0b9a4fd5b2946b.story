Police are on the hunt for fighting supporters they'd like to question in relation to violence during Queens Park Rangers' win against Wigan Athletic last Monday.

They have appealed for help in identifying five men who were involved in a fracas that 'turned nasty' as Harry Redknapp's side reached Wembley by beating the Latics in the Championship play-off semi-final at Loftus Road.

A Charlie Austin double turned the tie on its head after James Perch's early opener for the visitors.

VIDEO Watch violence break out during QPR's win against Wigan last Monday night

Search: Police have launched an appeal to identify five football fans who were involved in fighting at QPR

Trouble: The brawlers are alleged to have had attacked stewards at Loftus Road

Moving an inch: There had appeared to be a stand-off between stewards and fans inside the ground

Mayhem: Supporters and stewards alike tumbled down the stairs as they collided in shocking scenes

And they're though! Charlie Austin was at the double for Rangers as they beat Wigan in the play-offs

But the night was marred by a brawl in the South Africa Road stand - housing home supporters.

Chief
 Superintendent Colin Morgan from Specialist Crime and Operations Public
 Order Branch said: 'This incident started with some pushing and shoving
 at the top of the stand.

'It
 quickly turned nasty as a large group of supporters and stewards fell 
and were forced backwards down the steep stairway that separates the 
stands.

'It
 was made worse by some supporters who then chose to punch, push and 
kick at the stewards. It was pure luck that no one was badly hurt. We 
will deal robustly with those responsible for disorder, whether inside 
or outside football venues, and we will bring them to court.'

Harry Redknapp's side face Derby County at Wembley on Saturday for a place in next season's Premier League.

Nothing to see here: Home supporters ran on the pitch in delight and the full-time whistle passed without note

On the hunt: Police want these men, who are alleged to have fought with stewards, identified
