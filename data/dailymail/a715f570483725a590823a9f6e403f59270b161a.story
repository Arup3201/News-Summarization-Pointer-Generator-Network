A beautifully-groomed classic Sydney apartment has been placed on the market, in its pristine original condition, for the first time in 45 years.

The owners Rod and Thelma Thompson, who had been dating for 12 years, decided they'd tie knot in 1968 just so they could receive a war service home loan and buy the property off the plan in 1969 for $16,000.

The couple have lived in the 92 square metre property up until this year.

Now the Randwick apartment, south-eastern Sydney, is set to hit the market next week with a price guide of $650,000 plus.

Selling agent Kiki Bermudez, of Mint 360 Property, says the two-bedroom unit is 'a rare find'.

A beautifully-groomed classic Sydney apartment, in its pristine original condition, has been placed on the market for the first time in 45 years

The owners Rod and Thelma Thompson bought the Randwick apartment, in south-eastern Sydney, off the plan in 1969 for $16,000. It is now on the market for more than $650,000

Selling agent Kiki Bermudez, of Mint 360 Property, says the two-bedroom unit is 'a rare find' and will hit the market early next week

Ms Bermudez is impressed by the 'retro' kitchen and eat-in kitchen of the property which was built in the 1960s

'A lot of people are describing it as retro, late 60s chic, but I really think it's an original gem,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was amazed by it when I first walked it. It's as if you step back in time when you see the interior of the property.'

Features include crystal chandeliers throughout the home, wallpaper with velvet texture, an original stove top and a large eat-in kitchen.

The unit - one of 12 in the building - is facing north, close to Randwick Racecourse, an external private laundry and a lock-up garage.

Mr Thompson, 92, reluctantly decided to put his home up for sale after his 97-year-old wife died in May.

Daughter-in-law Cherie Fyson says if it wasn't for the property, the pair wouldn't have married.

'After they met at a dance in 1952 they lived together for 12 years,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'But then they wanted to buy this property and needed the loan. If it wasn't for that, they still wouldn't be married to this day.'

Mrs Fyson attributes the property's well-maintained condition to Mr Thompson - who used to calculate mileage on government cars as his day job.

'Thelma used to call Rod her "toy boy" - he did all the washing, cleaning, cooking and even rubbed cream in her legs for her,' she said.

'But ever since she died, Rod has been sitting in the home very lonely and by himself so he decided to finally sell it.'

The couple never had children together but Mrs Thompson - who was a seamstress - had two from a previous marriage. 

The first inspection will be held on Saturday and real estate agent Ms Bermudez says she plans on dressing up in 1960s attire.

She says it is most likely this is the only unit in the block that's been kept the way it was bought 45 years ago.

If not sold prior, the apartment will go under the hammer on November 22.
