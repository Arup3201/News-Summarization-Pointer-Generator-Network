Michele Bachmann was this morning finally declared the projected winner of her congressional race with 98 per cent of precincts reporting and the one-time presidential candidate scraping by with a narrow 3,966-vote lead.

It wasn't until the very final ballots were counted in her close race against businessman Jim Graves that Bachmann was announced as the winner, scraping through by a very slim margin.

While she prevailed in the end, the close nature of her race and the defeat of another half dozen other Tea Party Republicans may spell the end of the conservative movement as a major political force. 

Focusing locally: Michele Bachmann, seen here in her Minnesota headquarters, is in a particularly tight race to hold on to her congressional seat and she raised the most out of all incumbents

Most notable were the losses of Florida's Allen West and Illinois' Joe Walsh.

The final tally in the race between 
West, a leading member of the Tea Party Caucus who ruffled feathers by 
calling a number of Democrats 'traitorous Communists', and challenger 
Patrick Murphy  but the Democrat is thought to have won by between 1,000
and 2,000 votes.

All told, USA Today reports that West spent $13million to hold on to his seat - nearly four times as much as Murphy raised.

Joe Walsh, West's fellow one-term peer
from Illinois, lost to Democratic war veteran Tammy Duckworth as she 
earned 55 per cent of the vote compared to his 45 per cent.

Both the races in the Florida 18th and
the Illinois 8th were noted for being particularly nasty as questions 
were raised over respective military records.

Murphy ran negative ads about West's 
time in both Kuwait and Iraq. Walsh drew the ire of some supporters 
after he said that he wasn't sure if Duckworth, who lost both legs 
during her time in Iraq, was a 'true hero'.

While New York is known for being a 
Democratic stronghold, whose Electoral College votes were quickly called
for President Obama. But upstate New York has a number of Republican 
congressional districts, including two where Tea Party-endorsed 
incumbents were ousted by Democratic challengers after just one term in 
the House.

Primping: Allen West was one of the leaders of the Tea Party Caucus when he was elected in 2010 but now faces a difficult race against 29-year-old Patrick Murphy

Elected to Congress in 2010 during the
Tea Party so-called 'uprising', Ann Marie Buerkle lost to Democrat Dan 
Maffei, the man she beat out from the seat in the first place.

Republican Nan Hayworth in Westchester
County was shut out by Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney, making him the 
state's first openly gay man elected to Congress.

While freshmen representatives like 
Buerkle, Hayworth, West, and Walsh make for a trend, the most 
interesting challenge still comes from that of incumbent Bachmann.

Her re-election should have been a 
breeze considering she was a serious contender for the presidency at one
point. She won the Ames straw poll last August in the pivotal swing 
state of Iowa, but her campaign eventually ran out of steam in January 
as she suspended her presidential bid just weeks before saying she would
run again for her spot in Congress.

By July, Politico reported that she 
had raised nearly $15million for her congressional war chest, and 
followed that with an additional $4.5million in July through September. 
All told, she raised the most out of all of her peers in Congress.

She only won in 2010 with 53 per cent of the vote, making it even more critical that every ballot is counted in this election.

By 5am, Bachmann was officially declared the projected winner, coming in just shy of a 4,000-vote lead.

Holding on: Republicans are expected to retain the House so John Boehner will remain Speaker

‘When she was running for president, 
her attention was clearly not on district concerns and I think that 
perception stuck with some voters and it is a vulnerability that Graves 
is trying to exploit,’ Minnesota’s Carleton College professor Steven 
Schier told Reuters.

Another female Republican who has come
under the spotlight is Mia Love, the African American from Utah who 
rose to prominence in conservative circles after her address at the 
Republican National Convention.

Her prime convention placement, which 
analysts speculated was done to show the diversity within the GOP, 
heightened her national recognition but apparently was not enough to 
take her over the edge.

Love conceded to Democrat Jim Matheson even though he was only up by less than one percentage point at the time.

Following hype over her strong speech,
Tea Party groups reportedly sent out emails to supporters saying that 
Love was being targeted by liberals intent on stopping her from making 
history as the first black female Republican elected to Congress.

Two Tea Party favorites who faced threats over ethical concerns had a split night.

Both Michael Grimm from New York and 
David Rivera from Florida are currently subject to federal 
investigations, but that apparently had little sway over New Yorkers.

Grimm held on to his seat, beating 
challenger Mark Murphy even though he is at the center of a campaign 
finance scandal where he was accused of taking contributions from the 
aide to a local rabbi in return for helping him get a green card.

Rivera is said to be at the center of 
an FBI investigation relating to the alleged funding of a fake campaign 
of one of his would-be competitors. Because of the continuing ethical 
questions, and the fact that he only won by 52 per cent of the vote in 
2010, it comes as little surprise that Democrat Joe Garcia claimed 
victory on Tuesday.

Looking at the larger picture, these 
loses meant little for the Republican party. The GOP retained its 
control over the House just as it was expected to do and John Boehner 
will remain the Speaker.

What they do change is the role and 
influence of the Tea Party, particularly in their credibility in regards
to their staying power.
