This does not appear to be a sick joke. Architects have designed a pair of apartment towers in South Korea that are unbelievably reminiscent of the 9/11 attacks on New York's World Trade Centre.

These incredible pictures show how Dutch architecture firm MVRDV somehow managed to design the eerie 260-metre and 300-metre towers next to each other, connected by a ‘pixelated cloud’.

And in a good contender for quote of the year, a company statement insists they did not ‘see the resemblance during the design process’ for the buildings - due to be completed in Seoul in 2015.

Madness: Dutch architecture firm MVRDV has designed a pair of apartment towers in South Korea that are unbelievably reminiscent of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre

Plans: MVRDV designed a 260-metre and 300-metre tower next to each other, joined by a 'pixelated cloud'

The luxury residential towers have 
been named ‘The Cloud’, with one reaching 260 metres or 54 floors and 
the other covering 60 floors over 300 metres. The total surface area is 
128,000 sq metres.

The 
‘cloud' is housed in a 10-floor tall structure positioned halfway up the
 structures, and the towers feature a fitness studio, pools, 
restaurants, cafes and a conference centre.

‘MVRDV
 regrets deeply any connotations The Cloud projects evokes (sic) 
regarding 9/11,’ a statement on the company’s website said, as it tries 
to stem the outrage it has already caused.

‘It
 was not our intention to create an image resembling the attacks nor did
 we see the resemblance during the design process. We sincerely 
apologise to anyone whose feelings we have hurt.’

A statement on the company's Facebook
 page added: 'A real media storm has started and we receive (sic) 
threatening emails and calls of angry people calling us Al Qaeda lovers 
or worse.'

The company said
 the Korean press did not report any resemblance to 9/11 and instead 
'hailed the project as a great innovation'. 'Basically the negative 
connotations came from the USA,' it added.

What makes this even more incredible 
is how nobody at the firm spotted the resemblance to the Twin Towers. 
The 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon killed 
almost 3,000 people.

MVRDV is an award-winning firm based 
in Rotterdam set up in 1993. It was featured in the New York Times three
 years ago and has designed buildings in Cleveland, New Orleans and New 
York.

And in what could be 
seen as a contradiction to the company’s statement, MVRDV spokesman Jan 
Knikker told Dutch-language newspaper Algemeen Dagblad that the link to 
9/11 has in fact been made.

'It was not our intention to create an image resembling the attacks nor did we see the resemblance during the design process. We sincerely apologise to anyone whose feelings we have hurt'

'I must admit that we also thought of September 11, 2001,' he says, in a translation of an article on Friday from Dutch to English. 'But it is not intended association with the attacks.'

In an interesting development it has been revealed ‘The Cloud’ will be built in the ‘Youngsan Dream Hub’, which is in part designed by the man behind the new World Trade Center complex.

Daniel Libeskind also presented a plan for a revamped lower Manhattan after 9/11 - which is closely resembled by the new buildings by MVRDV, reported by the International Business Times.

New Orleans: The house design for Hurricane Katrina survivors looked like the house was bent double from strong winds

This isn’t the first time that MVRDV has courted controversy after a disaster.

Following Hurricane Katrina it designed a house for victims in New Orleans in association with Brad Pitt's Make It Right foundation, reported the International Business Times.

But the house design threatened to outrage survivors as it looked like the property was bent double from strong winds.

‘Provocation is good, because it pushes people,’ MVRDV head Winy Maas told Metropolis at the time, before referencing the controversial director of Fahrenheit 9/11. ‘We need architectural Michael Moores.’
