When seven-year-old Tanner Harris saw his favorite Ole Miss football player Laquon Treadwell fracture a fibula and dislocate his ankle just as he was about to score, he broke down crying.

So to let the receiver know how much he meant to him, Harris thought he would write him a letter.

The heartwarming letter has since drawn plenty of attention online and hopefully gave Treadwell a smile as he heals.

The family are long time Ole Miss fans who used to buy seasons tickets every year

'Dear Laquon,' Harris writes. 'You are my favorite Ole Miss football player.

'I enjoy watching you every week. For Christmas I am asking Santa to bring me a #1 jersey. 

'I am sorry you hurt your leg and ankle. I hope you get better soon. 

'Your #1 fan, Tanner Harris.'

Treadwell was badly injured when he leg was pinned under linebacker Kris Frost while trying to reach the goal line.

'Tanner is a pure fan, right down to his bones,' father Josh told The Clarion Ledger. 

 'Yes, he's 7 years old. He's my son and, of course, I'm biased. But I think he understands much more football than most kids his age. He was asking me (Sunday) about the (national) rankings and where Ole Miss might fit in. He is as entrenched as a 7-year-old can be.'

He says the family are long time Ole Miss fans who used to buy seasons tickets every year.

He's unsure what drew Tanner to Treadwell.

'I'm just thankful that he did,' Josh said. 'We are a Christian family, and as a parent you are concerned about who your children choose to look up. And let's face it, these football players are like Spiderman and Superman in real life to young kids.'
