As five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather and Marcos Maidana prepare to go head-to-head in Las Vegas, Sportsmail's boxing columnist Jeff Powell gives his verdict from the MGM Grand...

Mayweather won their fight in May by unanimous decision but the former WBA welterweight champion Maidana is back at the MGM Grand to reclaim his title.

'I think we'll see Mayweather mobile and very difficult to hit. The issue is whether Floyd's legs have gone slightly.'
