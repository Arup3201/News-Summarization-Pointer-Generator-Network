Taxpayers face a bill for at least £100million after the competition to run the flagship West Coast rail franchise descended into a humiliating farce yesterday.

In an embarrassing U-turn – announced one minute after midnight – Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin pulled the plug on the 15-month bidding process to run trains between London and Glasgow.

In a highly unusual move, three officials at the Department for Transport were suspended as ministers sought to blame civil servants for a series of ‘unacceptable mistakes’ in the way the department handled bids by FirstGroup, Virgin and two other companies.

Mr McLoughlin said the department was ‘wholly and squarely’ to blame for getting its sums wrong.

Bidding on three other rail franchises
 was also suspended. The DfT’s permanent secretary Philip Rutnam said he
 had suspended three civil servants, two of them senior, connected with 
the franchise bid.

Labour – which said it would consider 
renationalising the railways – claimed ministers bore some 
responsibility for the ‘debacle’.

David Cameron was said to be furious 
about the handling of the multi-billion-pound franchise bid.

A source said the revelation that the DfT had made serious errors had ‘gone down like a cup of cold sick’ in Downing Street.

The affair also threatened to shred 
the reputation of rising Tory star Justine Greening who, as Transport 
Secretary, had repeatedly brushed aside concerns about the bidding 
process.

And it is a warning shot to Theresa 
Villiers who, as Rail Minister, actually signed off the controversial 
deal. She has since been promoted to be Northern Ireland Secretary.

Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, whose court challenge forced the Government to examine its decision, welcomed the climbdown.

Sir Richard, who branded the DfT’s 
initial decision as ‘insane’, told the Mail that his firm, which has run
 the franchise for 14 years, faced ‘institutional bias’ from DfT 
officials.

‘FirstGroup were given information 
Virgin was not given. And some of the information was not given to 
everyone equally,’ he said.

‘But to the credit of the new minister, he said they were 100 per cent guilty and were dealing with it.’

Sir Richard said it was ‘highly 
likely’ he would continue to run the route for the next two years and 
would  donate all profits to ‘good causes’ including developing greener 
fuels.

Virgin complained that FirstGroup, 
which offered £2billion more, had overbid for the lucrative franchise 
and would be unable to deliver – a claim flatly denied by First.

Former cabinet secretary Lord O'Donnell, who retired last December, admitted the West Coast fiasco 'does raise some issues about skills in the civil service'.

He said civil servants who made mistakes should be held accountable, adding: 'There are civil servants up and down the country doing great jobs, but we are suffering some areas where there are skills shortages, in the commissioning area, in the procurement area.'

He added that this results in 'occasional mistakes'.

Lord O'Donnell claimed Whitehall must pay higher salaries if it wanted the best staff, telling Today: 'That's part of the answer and we should be prepared to do that.

'Having an arbitrary constraint like the Prime Minister's salary isn't helpful.'

Hel added: 'It's not that they're greedy, but pay is a measure of how much they feel they're valued.'

He also criticised ministers who attacked civil servants, saying it was 'a mistake' and 'self-defeating'.

Yesterday Mr McLoughlin acknowledged his department had fatally miscalculated the risk attached to the rival projects.

Mr McLoughlin said the decision to 
cancel the bidding process would cost £40million, but most observers 
expect the final bill to rise to well over £100million because of 
potential compensation claims from FirstGroup and the costs associated 
with a complete overhaul of the franchise system.

Julie Hilling, a Labour member of the 
Commons transport committee, said: ‘They are talking about £40million 
but it will be several times that in the end by the time all the legal 
issues are settled – it is an utter shambles.’

FirstGroup, which had initially been 
told it had won the contract, saw £240million wiped off the value of its
 shares as they plunged by 21 per cent on the news. The firm was last 
night said to be considering legal action.

All change: The competition to run the West Coast Main Line, which runs from London to Scotland, has been cancelled

Mr McLoughlin said he was ‘very 
angry’ about what had happened, insisting: ‘I want to make it absolutely
 clear that neither FirstGroup nor Virgin did anything wrong.

'The fault of this lies wholly and 
squarely with the DfT. Both of those two companies acted properly on the
 advice that they were getting from the Department.’

Mr McLoughlin said the mistakes had 
been uncovered as the DfT prepared for the Virgin legal challenge. 
FirstGroup was supposed to take over the line on December 9.

Labour leader Ed Miliband branded the 
bidding process ‘a disgrace’. He said the Prime Minister – who was urged
 by Sir Richard to take personal charge of the affair – bore 
responsibility for the disastrous outcome.

He also indicated he was willing to reconsider the ownership of the rail network. 

Asked what form rail ownership might 
take under a future Labour government, he told the BBC: ‘It could be 
public, it could be private, it could be not for profit franchises.

Here are the key dates in the West Coast Main Line franchise saga:

1997: Virgin Rail, a joint venture between Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Trains and Stagecoach, begins running the West Coast Main Line after being awarded a 15-year contract following the privatisation of UK railways.

2011: The Department for Transport (DfT) invites bids from companies interested in taking over the franchise when Virgin's contract expires in December 2012.

Dutch train operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen, Virgin and First West Coast Limited, a subsidiary of the UK's largest rail operator FirstGroup enter the 15-month long competition process.

A joint bid from French transport group Keolis and the country's national state-owned railway company SNCF is also received by the DfT.

August 15, 2012: The Department for Transport announces it intends to award the West Coast franchise to Aberdeen-based FirstGroup but is yet to sign the 13-year deal.

More than 150,000 people sign an online petition calling for the decision to be reconsidered.

August 26, 2012: Sir Richard offers to run the line "for free" to give Parliament time to conduct a review into the procurement process.

He said Virgin Trains and Stagecoach would run the service on a not-for-profit basis after December if MPs needed more time to look at the matter.

August 27, 2012: Labour urges the Government to delay signing the contract with FirstGroup until Parliament reconvenes so the matter can be debated in the Commons.

The DfT says there is "no reason" to delay the signing.

August 28, 2012: Virgin starts High Court proceedings demanding a judicial review into the decision to hand the contract to FirstGroup.

Then transport secretary Justine Greening says the government will fight the legal challenge, with the DfT stating it was confident the competition process was robust. Singing of the contract is delayed due to the legal proceedings.

September 10, 2012: Commons Transport Select Committee takes evidence from Sir Richard, FirstGroup chief executive Tim O'Toole and DfT officials in the wake of the franchise row.

The Virgin boss describes his rival's bid as 'absolutely preposterous'.

October 3, 2012: The DfT announces the decision to award the West Coast franchise to FirstGroup has been scrapped following the discovery of significant technical flaws in the procurement process.

The Government says the bidding process must be rerun and that it will no longer be contesting the judicial review sought by Virgin.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin orders two urgent independent reviews into the matter.
