Martyn Rooney anchored Great Britain's 4x400 metres relay team to gold as the favourites fulfilled their potential in breaking the three-minute barrier on the final day of the European Championships.

Having seen their female compatriots win bronze and Chris O'Hare finish third in the 1500m earlier in the afternoon, the British quartet ensured they would top the podium at the Stadion Letzigrund.

Conrad Williams, Matthew Hudson-Smith, Michael Bingham and Rooney were charged with bringing the baton home and did not disappoint in the Zurich sunshine.

Williams - one of the three in action to have featured in the triumphant England team at the Commonwealth Games - produced a sturdy first leg, handing the baton over to Hudson-Smith at the front of the pack.

The teenager, fresh from winning individual silver on Friday, followed it with a strong leg which was matched by Bingham, who handed over to anchorman Rooney in second place.

Taking the confidence brought by Friday's gold medal - his first at a major championship - the 27-year-old powered past the Russians, crossing in a Europe-leading two minutes 58.79 seconds. 

'I can't believe what's happened,' Hudson-Smith told the BBC. 'I just can't. It's been a hell of a journey. I'm enjoying it and it's fun.'

Relay team-mate Bingham added: 'When Matthew first came into the team we were trying to make sure the environment was good for him.

'But what he did was chilled the whole environment out and that allowed us to keep the same camaraderie between the team - and win gold.'

Those comments echoed the thoughts of the women's 4x400m team, who had considered a protest against Ukraine until viewing the video with the track referee.

'It's really great to be part of this team and to come back after the 400m hurdles final and give a good performance,' Eilidh Child said after adding relay bronze to her 400m hurdles title.

'I'm really happy but we set our sights high and ideally, we wanted the gold medal.'

Striding clear: The victory completed a great championship for Rooney who won the individual 400m
