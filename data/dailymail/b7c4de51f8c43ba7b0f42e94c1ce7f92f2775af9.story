Ever thought it was awkward eating in a restaurant on your own? Try dining with a giant Moomin sat in front of you. 

A restaurant in Tokyo called The Moomin Cafe sits stuffed Moomin toys in front of diners to make them feel less uncomfortable. 

There are a selection of toys available to keep diners company at lunch.

A restaurant says it has solved the solo dining by offering customers the chance to eat with a Moomin

Dinner date: There are a selection of toys available to keep diners company at lunch

Some of 
the meals appear to be inspired by the fictional characters created by 
Swedish-speaking Finnish illustrator Tove Jansson.

The cafe recently launched in New York but it is still not sure whether there are plans for a restaurant in the UK.

Tove Jansson's Moomin books have sold in their millions, and been translated into 44 languages. 

Jansson's first Moomin book - The Moomins and the Great Flood - was published in 1945.

A love of everything Moomin has been the inspiration for this cafe which has opened in Tokyo

The Moomin Cafe is a tribute to the books created by Finnish writer and illustrator Tove Jansson

Tasty: Meals are served with a distinct Moomin theme at the cafe in Tokyo

It is the story about Moominmamma's and Moomintroll's search for the missing Moominpappa and how they found their way to the Moominvalley. 

Tove Jansson died in the summer of 2001, aged 87. 

Since the Moomins and the Great Flood in 1945, more than 15 million Moomin books have been sold, around the world.

The Moomins has also been made into television series, films and even a theme park called Moomin World in Naantali, Finland.
