Rescue divers were this morning given between 12 and 24 hours to complete their search of the stricken Costa Concordia cruise liner.

Firefighters warned that time is running out as rough seas are predicted to hit the Tuscan island of Giglio later today.

It prompted fears to rise that high waves could push the ship from its rocky resting place and send it plummeting 100m down to the bottom of the Mediterranean sea.

Stormy weather has already postponed work to to avert a potential ecological disaster by extracting the half-million gallons of fuel on board the vessel.

Resuming: Divers have little time left to finish their search of the Costa Concordia before it becomes too dangerous, firefighters have warned

The warning came as the search for 21 missing people resumed and a leading maritime publication said the ship's sinking was 'not a black and white case'.

It followed the discovery that Gertrud Goergens, who was initially thought to be trapped onboard, was now safe back home in Germany.

Richard Meade, editor of maritime magazine Lloyd's List Intelligence, said that the tracking of the same ship's route in August showed it actually went slightly closer to Giglio than the course that caused Friday's disaster.

He said: 'This is not a black-and-white case. Our data suggests that both routes took the vessel within 200 meters of the impact point and that the authorised route was actually closer to shore.'

Eleven people have been confirmed dead so far, and 21 are missing.

A Hungarian victim was identified yesterday as 38-year-old Sandor Feher, who had been working as an entertainer on the stricken cruise ship.

His body was found inside the wreck and identified by his mother, who had travelled to the Italian city of Grosseto, according to Hungary's foreign ministry.

Jozsef Balog, a pianist who worked with Feher on the ship, told the Blikk newspaper that Feher was wearing a lifejacket when he decided to return to his cabin to retrieve his violin.

A salvage company is preparing to pump more than 2,300 tonnes of fuel out from the ship's 17 tanks.

Italian Environment Minister Corrado Clini said it would take 10 days to pump all the fuel out of the ship.

He added that he would declare a 'state of emergency' later this week to release state funds to deal with any environmental problems.

Feher was last seen on deck en route to the area where he was supposed to board a lifeboat.

According to Balog, Feher helped put lifejackets on several crying children before returning to his cabin.

Feher's friend Ian Fraser, of Esh Winning in County Durham, was working alongside him as a singer on the trip and has paid tribute to him.

Fraser, who jumped overboard and swam to for his life, said: 'I had worked with him on another contract before.

'He was a genius, a magnificent violinist. I had just spoken to him earlier in the day, he had been unwell with the flu.'

Among the missing include 5-year-old Dayana Arlotti and her father, William Arlotti, who were on the cruise with the father's girlfriend.

Peruvian crew member Erika Soria, 26, and American couple Jerry and Barbara Heil, from White Bear Lake in Minnesota, are also still unaccounted for.

A U.S. congressional committee announced yesterday it will hold a hearing next month on the safety implications of the Costa Concordia accident.

It said U.S. and international maritime organisations need to ensure standards are in place to protect passengers' safety on cruise ships.

House arrest: Captain Francesco Schettino told magistrates his actions saved 'thousands of lives'

Tragedy: Schettino faces the prospect of charges of multiple manslaughter, causing shipwreck and abandoning ship

Passengers have complained vocally about the chaotic evacuation and poor treatment by Costa officials once they got on land.

Some have said they were provided only a single night of hotel accommodations and denied help getting to their embassies to get new passports.

Costa owner, Miami-based Carnival Corp, responded yesterday by saying it was offering assistance and counselling to passengers and crew and was trying to take stock of lost possessions.

In a statement it said: 'Costa has also begun the process of refunding all voyage costs including both passenger cruise fares and all costs incurred while on board.

'Our senior management teams are working together to determine additional support.'

As further details continue to emerge, 
yesterday the ship's 'Captain Coward' Francesco Schettino was quoted as 
saying he tripped and fell into the water from the listing vessel and 
never intended to abandon his passengers.

Operation: Rescue workers are continuing to search the boat today

The $450 million Costa Concordia was carrying more than 4,200 passengers and crew when it slammed into a reef and capsized Friday after the captain made an unauthorised diversion from his programmed route and strayed into the perilous waters.

Schettino, who was jailed after he left the ship before everyone was safely evacuated, was placed under house arrest on Tuesday, facing possible charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning his ship.

The ship's operator, Crociere Costa SpA, has accused Schettino of causing the wreck by making the unapproved detour.

The captain has acknowledged carrying out what he called a 'tourist navigation' that brought the ship closer to Giglio.

Costa has said such a navigational 'fly-by' was done last in August after being approved by the company and Giglio port authorities.
