The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa could infect more than 20,000 people, the World Health Organisation has revealed in a bleak assessment of the deadly disease.

The United Nations health agency issued plans to combat the outbreak in four West African nations - Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria - where it said the actual number of cases could already be two to four times higher than the reported 3,069. The current death toll stands at 1,552.

The news comes as a new outbreak was confirmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo after a pregnant woman contracted the disease from infected bush meat and passed it on to health workers.

Treatment: The World Health Organisation has revealed plans to combat Ebola in four West African nations - Guinea (pictured), Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria - where it said the actual number of cases could already be far higher than the reported 3,069. The death toll in the West African epidemic alone currently stands at 1,552

Describing plans to tackle the West African outbreak, the WHO said: 'This roadmap assumes that in many areas of intense transmission the actual number of cases may be two-four fold higher than that currently reported.'

'It acknowledges that the aggregate case load of Ebola Virus Disease could exceed 20,000 over the course of this emergency,' the agency added. 

The deadly West African outbreak that began in Guinea in March and has since spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, requires a massive and coordinated international response, the WHO said.

'Response activities must be adapted in areas of very intense transmission and particular attention must be given to stopping transmission in capital cities and major ports, thereby facilitating the larger response and relief effort,' the WHO said.

The virus is still being spread in a 'substantial number of localities', aggravating fragile social and economic conditions and has already killed an unprecedented number of health workers.

Today it was revealed that Nigeria has confirmed its first Ebola death outside the city of Lagos, with a doctor succumbing to the virus in the oil hub Port Harcourt last Friday.

A further 70 people are now under surveillance in the city, with the man's wife among those that have been placed in quarantine.

A wider U.N.-led plan being launched by the end of September is 'expected to underpin support for the increasingly acute problems associated with food security, protection, water, sanitation and hygiene, primary and secondary health care and education, as well as the longer-term recovery effort that will be needed,' the WHO said in today's report.

A separate outbreak of Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo - identified as a different strain and thought to have started when a pregnant woman contracted the virus from infected bush meat - is not included in the WHO's forecast.

An unnamed woman in the village of Ikanamongo in DRC's northern Equateur Province is believed to have butchered an animal that had been captured and killed by her husband shortly before falling ill.

The woman was subsequently transported to a private clinic in nearby Isaka village for specialist care due to her pregnancy, but she subsequently died of a then-unidentified haemorrhagic fever.

The Ebola then infected and killed a number of the woman's relatives and health care workers due to local customs and rituals carried out on her corpse that delayed her funeral by more than a week.

The DRC's Ministry of Health notified the World Health Organization of the outbreak on Tuesday, following the woman's death on August 11.

Since then a number of her relatives and at least four health-care workers who were exposed to her corpse have died, and there a reports several others are seriously ill.

In a report, WHO blamed 'local customs and rituals associated with death' for delaying the woman's burial and dramatically increasing the number of people coming into close contact with her body.

Between 28 July and 18 August this year, a total of 24 suspected cases of Ebola have been identified in the DRC, leading to at least 13 deaths.

It is Congo's seventh outbreak since the deadly hemorrhagic fever was discovered in 1976 in the same isolated northwestern jungle province in which the pregnant woman died.

Crucially, the strain currently infecting people in DRC is different to that which has already killed at least 1,427 people in West Africa - which has somewhat allayed fears that the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history could have somehow travelled thousands of miles to the continent's centre.

Among the healthcare workers known to have died shortly after coming in to contact with the pregnant woman are one doctor and two nurses who performed her surgery, a male ward assistant, and a hygiene specialist working in the clinic.

WHO said an unknown number of her relatives involved in 'local customs and rituals' relating to her death have also now died, without expanding on what those practices might have been.

A further 11 cases are being held in isolation centres suffering the suspected symptoms of the disease - which kills in the vast majority of cases - with tissue samples sent to laboratories in the DRC's capital Kinshasa, and in neighbouring Gabon for further analysis.

In total it is believed at least 80 people came into close enough contact to contract the virus from the pregnant woman between the time of her infection and eventual burial.

In response to the outbreak, the DRC's Ministry of Health has dispatched teams of scientists and investigators to Equateur Province in order to evaluate the situation there and work out how many other people may be at risk - either from human-to-human transmission or from infected bush meat.

Neither the deceased pregnant woman nor any of her 80 contacts have any history of travel to the areas of West Africa currently hit by an alternative strain of Ebola. 

News of the DRC outbreak comes as U.S. health officials prepared to announce that a human study of an Ebola vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline will begin within a couple of weeks.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, will start the study no later than the end of the year, according to people familiar with the plans.

In addition, a steering committee made up of senior officials from NIH and the Department of Defense last week approved the first step toward using three advanced laboratories to manufacture Ebola vaccines and treatments.

The three labs, in Texas, Maryland and North Carolina, were set up in 2012 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in partnership with private industry to respond to pandemics or chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear threats.

A GSK spokeswoman confirmed that the trial would begin but declined to specify when.
