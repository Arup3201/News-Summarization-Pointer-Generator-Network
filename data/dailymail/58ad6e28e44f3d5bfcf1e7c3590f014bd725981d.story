Outnumbered: Surveillance video shows Lewis Perkins and another male attacking the defenseless bus driver

The attack is alleged to have happened after Perkins and the 14-year-old berated the driver for being late and refused to pay their fare, the Kansas City Star reported. 

Despite someone offering to pay their fare, the hoodlums continued to harass and curse the driver according to the Star. Having grown tired of their antics, he pulled the bus over and ordered them both off the bus. When they refused, he attempted to physically remove them, that’s when all hell broke loose.

Perkins and his juvenile delinquent co-hort can be seen in the surveillance video jumping the driver, knocking him to the ground and beating and stabbing him before running off as passengers simply watched the mayhem unfold, with one even seen filming it on his cell phone. A passenger eventually called 911, but the damage was already done.

The seven-year veteran driver suffered stab wounds to his abdomen and back, but is expected to return to the job, according to the Star.

This attack is the latest in a series of violent attacks on Kansas City bus drivers.

A
driver was knocked out after being punched by an angry passenger in 
October, and another driver was badly beaten by an angry passenger the 
following month, according to KCTV.

Officials see this attack as an escalation in the violence against drivers.

‘It's the first time I've ever seen when
a weapon was used on a driver with intent to do harm to the driver,’ 
B.J. Garcia, Kansas City-Area Transit Authority manager of safety and 
instruction, told KCTV.

‘Three attacks, while not a big number, three is
too many. I'm not sure what the cause is or what the temperament of the
public is that's causing that,’ he added.

The attacks aren’t just limited to drivers, just last week a passenger poured gasoline on other passengers with the intent of lighting them on fire, according to KCTV.

Perkins and his accomplice have been charged with first-degree assault and armed criminal action. Authorities are seeking a $100,000 bond for Perkins and filed charges against the 14-year-old in family court, due to his age. Officials have not said whether the two assailants are related, both remain in custody.
