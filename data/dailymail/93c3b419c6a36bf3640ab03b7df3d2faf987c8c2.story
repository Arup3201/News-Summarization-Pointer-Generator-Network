Serious: Martin Wheatley is reviewing Libor for the Government and has declared it is 'no longer fit for purpose'

Libor could be scrapped completely in the wake of the rigging scandal that has swept through Britain's biggest banks.

The Government has asked finance expert Martin Wheatley to head an official inquiry into how the key benchmark borrowing rate is set, and he said today it is 'no longer fit for purpose'.

Mr Wheatley has published a paper aimed at trying to restore credibility and trust in a system that was so dramatically and secretly manipulated.

Barclays was handed a £290 million fine for their role in the scandal, which eventually forced boss Bob Diamond to stand down.

Meanwhile 17 of the world's biggest banks are accused of doing the same and look likely to be punished just as heavily.

Mr Wheatley, who who heads conduct regulation for the Financial Services Authority, is openly considering axing Libor completely and replacing it with a rate based on trades that would make it harder to manipulate.

And a new independent body could be set up to watch out for any suspicious activity, his report said.

Mr Wheatley also wants more powers to prosecute rogue bankers.

In a speech this morning, Mr Wheatley said: 'The attempted manipulation of Libor and its European equivalent Euribor have cast a shadow over the industry at large and the construction and governance of the benchmark themselves.

'It is clear that regardless of the outcome of ongoing international investigations, trust in a vital part of the financial system has been badly damaged and timely action is needed to restore it.'

The Wheatley Review, which was ordered by Chancellor George Osborne said any move to using new rates would need to be carefully planned to limit disruption.

Libor is an indicator of how much banks are charged to borrow money and can also be a benchmark of their financial health.

It is used to set the price of hundreds of trillions of dollars of contracts across the world, including some mortgages and loans to businesses.

However, the Libor scandal revealed that the system, currently overseen by the British Bankers' Association, has been abused by traders who lied about their bank's borrowing costs, in order to benefit their colleagues' trading positions or make the company seem more secure.

The paper will now allow four weeks for banks and other parties to respond, and final recommendations are expected to be published by the end of next month.

Chancellor George Osborne said: 'We've got to have a financial system we can all trust.

'This review shows the Government is acting swiftly and decisively to address the failings of Libor and put right what went wrong.

'We will now be able to make any changes to the law that are needed quickly, instead of waiting years. It shows we made the right decision last month.'

The fast pace of the review is designed to allow its findings to be implemented in the Financial Services Bill, which is being discussed in the House of Lords.

Peter Vicary-Smith, chief executive of Which?, said: 'Mr Wheatley has said it's vital to rebuild trust in the Libor setting process, but the bigger job is to rebuild trust in banking that has been shattered by one scandal after another.

'The Government and regulator must now thoroughly investigate the impact of Libor rate-rigging on ordinary borrowers and savers, and introduce a collective redress system to properly compensate consumers if they have lost out.'
