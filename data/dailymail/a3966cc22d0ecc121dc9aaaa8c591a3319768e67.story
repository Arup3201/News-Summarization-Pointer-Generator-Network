Nigel Farage has been accused of 'abusing his power' to try to help Kerry Smith (pictured) become MP for Basildon South in Essex

Nigel Farage was embroiled in a damaging new row last night over the Ukip candidate forced to resign because of racist and obscene remarks.

The Ukip leader was accused by senior party figures of ‘abusing his power’ to try to help Kerry Smith become MP for Basildon South in Essex.

The Mail on Sunday can also disclose a leaked email shows Mr Farage urged Ukip chiefs to ignore protests about Mr Smith’s ‘rough and ready’ style and ‘unsubstantiated rumours’ about him. The news came as it was revealed that:

The dispute has fuelled fears among Ukip supporters that a series of controversies threatens to wreck its hopes of success in May’s General Election.

Mr Smith was forced to resign as a candidate last week after The Mail on Sunday revealed he mocked gays as ‘pooftahs’ and referred to a woman as a ‘chinky bird’ in bombshell phone calls.

But to the dismay of several prominent Ukip supporters, Mr Farage continued to defend him, claiming Mr Smith ‘talks and speaks’ like lots of Britons.

A leaked email shows the lengths Mr Farage was prepared to go to help him be selected for the seat. When Ukip members in Basildon met 11 days ago to pick a candidate, Mr Smith was not on the list, having been banned weeks earlier. But hours before they met, Mr Farage emailed Ukip’s national executive urging them to give him another chance.

He wrote: ‘As leader of Ukip I have never involved myself in candidate selections. But in the case of Basildon South, I have received many objections to the removal of Kerry Smith from the local branch. The reason for his exclusion is he is a bit rough and ready, and there were several rumours which have not been substantiated.

‘We have been too cautious so I recommend we reverse our earlier decision.’

Mr Farage’s call was immediately backed by his party’s National Executive Committee and the same day Mr Smith was selected.

Mr Farage’s intervention came as Mr Hamilton, now a Ukip supporter, was stopped from competing for the Basildon seat. He was forced to pull out after a Ukip letter concerning claims he abused his expenses was leaked.

It prompted claims that Mr Farage’s main aim was to block Hamilton, seen by some as a higher profile vote loser.

A senior Ukip source said: ‘Nigel has shown a lack of judgment over Kerry Smith. In the eyes of some he abused his power in trying to get him a Parliamentary seat. We can’t understand why he appears so keen to speak up for Smith. It looks as though he was so desperate to stop Hamilton, whom he dislikes and sees as a rival, he lost all sense of proportion.’

Ukip leaders also revealed a tape of Mr Smith’s remarks was sent to them months ago.

A party insider said: ‘Farage’s team knew about Smith’s disgraceful remarks. That is why he was fired in the first place. They thought the tape recording would never see the light of day so they put him back on the list. Others thought the public should know the truth.’

Mr Farage overturned the ban to stop ex-Tory Neil Hamilton, who was disgraced in the 1990s ‘cash for questions’ scandal, getting the Basildon seat.
