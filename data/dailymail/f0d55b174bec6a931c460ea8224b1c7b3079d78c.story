A woman who was found dead in a house fire on Tuesday was actually strangled, an autopsy from the local medical examiner’s office found.

Erica Rodriguez, a 40-year-old mother of three, died of strangulation, not the fire that destroyed her Oak Forest, Illinois, home this week, officials said.

Her home at 153rd and Central caught fire on Tuesday at about 9.30am.

Fire fighters found Ms Rodriguez dead inside after being alerted by passersby, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Her husband, Martin Rodriguez, 48, was severely burned and his throat was slashed.

A local police chief said Mr Rodriguez was being treated at a local medical center and is currently being hospitalized in ‘critical condition.'

Investigators were finally able to talk to him on Friday, police said.

The couple’s three children, ages 6, 15, and 17, were at school during the fire.

Police say they are now staying with a family member.

The cause of the fire is not known and no suspects have been named. Illinois State Fire Marshal and South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force are investigating the homicide.

‘We are committed to bring all investigative resources together to solve this homicide,’ Oak Forest Police Chief Greg Anderson said.

‘The entire family of Erica Rodriguez needs to know who could have committed such an act and who is responsible.’
