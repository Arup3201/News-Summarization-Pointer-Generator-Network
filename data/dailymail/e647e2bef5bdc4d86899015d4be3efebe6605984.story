Lord Prescott is at the centre of a £75million legal case over allegations that he tried to undermine coal miners’ compensation claims – because he feared Labour could lose union donations.

Court papers seen by The Mail on Sunday allege the former deputy prime minister colluded with a major law firm to put pressure on an insurance company to refuse to underwrite the miners’ legal bills – forcing them to drop their action.

Fear: It is claimed the former deputy prime minister feared union pay outs could cripple the Labour's income

The papers claim that if the miners had succeeded, the unions and their law firms faced having to pay out crippling multi-million pound settlements, potentially hitting union donations to the Labour Party.

The miners were hoping to sue more than 50 law firms used by their unions that had been found by legal watchdogs to have improperly deducted millions of pounds from compensation payments they had won for lung and other diseases.

In the new case, it is alleged that in 2006 Lord Prescott, in collusion with Thompsons Solicitors, threatened an executive at insurance firm Templeton.

He told him to remove its offer of insurance to the miners or his company would face an investigation by the City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, it is claimed.

Lord Prescott denies the allegations and says his private phone records show that no phone call was made to the executive.

Thompsons also denies that the law firm ‘asked or procured Lord Prescott to do its “bidding” and say they ‘did not invite or pressure Templeton to act unlawfully’.
