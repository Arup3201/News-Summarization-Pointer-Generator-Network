Danny Boyle's 'bloody brilliant' opening ceremony featuring a vast array of British stars and young talent was hailed as a triumph tonight.

The event, which featured a diverse cast including James Bond star Daniel Craig and JK Rowling, soared through the history of Britain to the modern day.

Wallander star Kenneth Branagh featured as the great engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, reading from Shakespeare's The Tempest in the historical section.

Historian Tom Holland tweeted: 'Shakespeare. Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Nimrod. Lots of Victorians in top hats. The Industrial Revolution. If only sport was always like this.'

Athletes, stars and viewers at home took to Twitter to express their delight at the 'amazing ceremony' that was also packed with music, dance and special effects.

Runner Paula Radcliffe @paulajradcliffe wrote at 9pm: 'Nobody does it like Britain - nobody!'

The world-wide audience was treated to a greatest hits medley of British pop over the decades with bursts of the Beatles, the Jam, Sex Pistols and Dizzee Rascal.

There were also excerpts from the Kinks, Frankie Goes To Hollywood and Mud's Tiger Feet before Emile Sande sang the cup final classic Abide With Me.

The Morecambe-born founder of Red or Dead, designer Wayne Hemingway, said: 'It just makes me so proud.

There was a lot of approval for the music playlist during the ceremony

The comedy sketch involving The Queen and Daniel Craig was another favourite part of the show

'Watching it made me proud to be a Lancastrian. Danny Boyle is from just down the road to me and so much of my life was in this, everything I believe in, the history from the industrial revolution right through to the NHS.'

Hemingway added: 'The musical bit was perfection from the wit and the guts to put Tiger Feet among the Beatles and the Who and then to give pretty much the whole of Pretty Vacant.

'Normally it would be brushed over, but the punk spirit which is in Britain was written through the ceremony.

'Anyone cynical about this has no lust for life, it's just bloody brilliant.

'I don't think anyone could find a fault. He deserves a knighthood.'

Singer-songwriter Billy Bragg agreed, tweeting: 'Impressive though #openingceremony in Beijing was, they didn't have any great pop music to play, did they?'

The comedy sketch with James Bond actor Daniel Craig and Britain's Queen Elizabeth was a big win with the audience.

In the tongue-in-cheek film Craig wears his trademark tuxedo and enters Buckingham Palace. The 86-year-old monarch with two corgis at her feet and in her cinematic debut, turns from a writing desk and says simply: 'Good evening, Mr. Bond.

The moment drew a huge cheer from the audience, not used to seeing Her Majesty play such an informal part in proceedings, and coincides with a resurgence in the royal family's popularity following the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.

Doubles of Bond and the queen then parachuted from a helicopter above the stadium, built on the Olympic Park in a once derelict area of London's East End, and the national anthem sang by schoolchildren and Union flag raising followed.

At 9.30pm, Gary Lineker ‏@GaryLineker tweeted: 'The Queen with James Bond was unquestionably a moment of utter genius. Take a bow Mr Boyle!'

Mr Boyle, the mastermind behind the ceremony, received praise from all corners for the show with famous names tweeting their congratulations.

The official twitter account for Downing Street, @Number10gov tweeted a message from the Prime Minister reading: 'The Opening Ceremony has been a great showcase for this country. It's more proof Britain can deliver.'

Television presenters Ant and Dec wrote: 'You can't not be proud to be British tonight. A triumph. Hats off to @DannyBoyleFilm.'

Footballer Frank Lampard tweeted that Mr Boyle had created 'the best Olympic ceremony of all time'.

Four-time Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy, the flagbearer for Team GB, also responded to good luck messages on the networking site, tweeting earlier: 'So many messages... Thank you for all the kind words. Tonight is going to be something special, hope you enjoy it!'

But not all the feedback was positive with many complaining that the announcements were made in French first rather than English.

Quint. S. Henschall, from Norwich, wrote on the Mail online: 'This is meant to be London Olympics, so whats with the French commentary, why, why, why!!'

James M from Devon commented: 'Tired of hearing French first, ceremony should be presented English first, when a ceremony is being held in an English speaking Country, what an insult.'

Another, Dan from the UK, wrote: 'I didn't realise Britain had been conquered by Napoleon, We speak English here my announcer.'

But many other viewers pointed out that all Olympic Games have used French as the first language.

Novelist and journalist Tony Parsons hit back at critics: 'Sneering at the Olympics is like sneering at Christmas. Do you want to be with Danny Boyle or Mitt Romney? Time to stop synchronised moaning.'
