A husband was shot in the stomach as he sat in a McDonald's when his wife's loaded gun fell out of her pocket.

Richard Lee Cooper, 47, was hit in the abdomen when the .22-caliber Derringer pistol fell to the floor, causing it to go off.

Barbara Annette Masters, 48, was carrying the loaded gun in her pocket as the pair ate at the McDonald's in Bend, Oregon, on Thursday afternoon.

Police were called to the restaurant at about 1.15pm where she was cited on third-degree assault and reckless endangering charges.

She was said to have cooperated with officers and was then released.

Masters was cited by police after the loaded gun, similar to the one pictured, went off

Lieutenant Chris Carney toldÂ KTVZ.com that a preliminary investigation had found the couple were sitting in the dining area when she learned forward and the gun fell.

Mr Cooper was taken to St Charles-Bend Hospital in a serious condition.

He was still in hospital on Friday, but his condition had improved to 'fair'.

Police said about 15 other people were in the McDonald's at the time of the shooting.

The police officer told the news 
station that the incident shows the importance of gun safety and for 
people to be vigilant when carrying a firearm.

He said: 'Obviously, with all the things 
going on in our country and round the world, anything like this will 
affect people, and it is really scary.'

Diners at the McDonald's said they felt lucky the shooting had not been worse and no else had been hurt.

Christina Burley told KTVZ that she was talking to another woman when they heard this 'huge boom'.

She said: 'Everybody just looked, you know, and were like "oh my God".

'Half of the restaurant just circled around him and started calling 911.'

Police said people should always treat guns as if they are loaded.

Masters has been criticised on gun forums for not wearing a holster.
