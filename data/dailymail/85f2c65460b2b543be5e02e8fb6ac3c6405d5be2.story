Mad Dog Ranch, home to the late rock star Joe Cocker, his wife Pam, their menagerie of animals and Joe's award-winning tomatoes, is on the market.

Built in 1994, the European-style mansion outside of Crawford, Colorado, is named after one of Cocker's most famous albums  from the late 1960s: 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen'.

Set in 243 acres of tranquil rolling meadows, towering aspens and English gardens, the house is overlooked by the dramatic Needle Rock volcanic formation.

The house is surrounded by stunning mountainous scenery and is overlooked by the 800-foot Needle Rock volcanic formation

The home is a welcoming site for entertaining, and Joe hosted infamous Snooker tournaments for friends in the grand Game Room

Built in 1994, outside of Crawford, Colorado, the 15,873 square-foot house is set in 243 acres of meadows and gardens and offers breathtaking views

Early in his career, Cocker performed at both Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival.
