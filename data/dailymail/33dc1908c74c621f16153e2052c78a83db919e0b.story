The MGM Grand is home to master magician David Copperfield and Amir Khan is under no illusion that it is he who will be disappearing from this mecca of boxing if Devon Alexander beats him here on Saturday.

In the final hours before his first bill-topping performance at this fabled arena, the English Muslim who would be king of the prize-ring acknowledged: ‘If I don’t win this one I’ll never get the chance of a shot at Floyd Mayweather.’

Worse still, he would not know what to do with life after next week’s delayed celebrations of his 28th birthday

Amir Khan admits a dream fight against Floyd Mayweather won't happen if he loses to Devon Alexander

‘The loser,’ he says, ‘will have nowhere to go.’

Well, in his case back to Bolton and a domestic dust-up with Kell Brook - maybe, reluctantly - but no return to this glittering Strip in the Nevada desert.

He says: ‘Neither me nor Alexander can afford to lose if we want to go on to super-fights against Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao.’

The word on the Strip is that a Khan victory over Alexander – like himself, a former two-time world champion – will hoist Khan to the top of Mayweather’s hit list for a multi-million dollar rendezvous in the spring.

Not that anything is ever certain when Mr Money comes to choosing his opponents, as Khan discovered to his cost a year ago.

On the promise of a Mayweather fight last May, Khan was encouraged to pull out of the December 2013 date originally set for this fight with Alexander.

Had he gone through with that and won, he not Brook would be a world-welterweight champion today. But then Alexander lost that title to Shawn Porter, who was subsequently relieved of the belt by Brook.

Now, even though the intervening 12 months have enabled him to grow into this star-spangled division from light-welter, Khan regrets that decision.

He says: ‘I’ve learned a lot of things this past year and one of them is to go with the flow when opportunity knocks, not sit around waiting for something that may not happen.’

Yet the boxing world works in mysterious ways. If anything, they are playing for even higher stakes in Casinoville this weekend.

If Mayweather wishes to avoid facing the most menacing threat to his cherished unbeaten record – namely Manny Pacquiao – he needs a credible alternative opponent in the first half of next year.

Alexander, who has two career losses to Khan’s three, says: ‘Once you get to the elite level a defeat always sets you back badly. But with so much at stake right now, this is definitely not the moment to lose.’

With than in mind, a measure of risk elimination has been applied by both trainers.

Virgil Hunter is urging calm on Khan, warning him to temper his fighting instinct until he is absolutely certain he has Alexander primed for a stoppage.

Khan says: ‘I think I’m always exciting to watch but this will be a chess match before the fireworks display. Devon is top class and I will box him as well as fight him.’

Alexander says: ‘Amir will not be the only fast man in this ring. But if he is a bit quicker than me then he will find that timing always trumps speed in the end.’

Given the high skill sets of both men the Grand Garden Arena could be putting on an evening for the boxing connoisseur, illuminated by bursts of explosive action.

Khan accepts that he needs not only to win but to do so in impressive style if he is to nail down Mayweather and he says: ‘I’m primed to make a statement to the world that I’m ready for the mega-fights.’

Alexander (right) is confident his speed and timing will prove to strong for Khan on Saturday 

Perhaps the danger he must beware most is Alexander being driven to over-achieve by emotional reaction to the civil unrest in his home city of St Louis. He hails from quite close to the neighbourhood of Ferguson, where protests about the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white policeman are ongoing and have been taken up in other cities across America.

His trainer, Kevin Cunningham, was born and bred in Ferguson and the pair of them ‘want a victory to take back to our town and bring a little happiness to our people.’

Cunningham has been unwell this week and there is some concern whether he will be able to take his place in the corner.

If not, what Alexander loses in advice and encouragement may be more than compensated for by a motivating desire to win for his boxing father figure.

Khan believes his move up to from light-welterweight to welterweight has given him extra punching power

Both protagonists believe they can win by knock-out.

Khan talks of his additional punching power generated by the extra poundage he has put on while becoming a full welterweight: ‘I’m hitting much harder now.’

Alexander subscribes to the popular theory of weakness in the Khan jaw: ‘If you’ re unlucky enough to be born with a suspect chin there’s not much you can do about it. When you get hit, you go down.’

However, with chess-board strategy likely to check-mate the pyrotechnics, I expect Khan to box his way to a victory on points.

*Khan v Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports late this Saturday night.
