David Cameron often only learns about government decisions when they are reported by the media, his former policy guru has revealed.

Painting a shambolic picture of the Downing Street operation, Steve Hilton said the inability of No 10 to control government decisions was ‘pretty horrific’.

‘Very often you’ll wake up in the morning and hear on the radio or the news or see something in the newspapers about something the Government is doing,’ he said.

David Cameron's former strategy guru Steve Hilton (left) has revealed that the Prime Minister often finds out about his own government's policies through the radio and in newspapers

‘And you think, well, hang on a second – it’s not just that we didn’t know it was happening, but we don’t even agree with it! The Government can be doing things... and we don’t agree with it? How can that be?’

Mr Hilton revealed that ministers spend only 30 per cent of their time dealing with the Government’s priorities, with 40 per cent spent handling diktats from the European Union and the rest on ‘random things... which were not anything to do with the coalition agreement’.

He described how No 10 is frequently left out of the loop as important policy changes are pushed through by ‘paper-shuffling’ civil servants who made life ‘impossible’ for ministers by drowning them in paperwork. ‘The bureaucracy masters the politicians,’ he said.

Mr Hilton, who is credited with masterminding Mr Cameron’s ‘detoxification’ of the Conservative Party in opposition, is regarded as his closest friend in politics and spent years as his policy adviser.

Steve Hilton, who was the Prime Minister's 'blue skies thinker' and remains one of his closest friends, said Cameron often opposes the measures his own ministers put forward

Born in 1969, a child of Hungarian immigrants, Hilton was a scholarship boy at Christ’s Hospital and studied PPE at Oxford.

He met Cameron when he was seconded from Saatchi & Saatchi to work on John Major’s 1992 election - when he came up with the 'New Labour, New Danger' advertisement.

Hilton set up a marketing consultancy, Good Business which worked with Nike, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola. 

He was widely credited with  his rebranding the 'nasty party' and turning Old Etonian Cameron into 'Dave'. 

Hilton's role was seen as marketing the prime minister for the more liberal audience who had switched to Blair in 1997.

It is believed Stewart Pearson in the biting TV satire The Thick Of It is based on Hilton.

He would often walk around Number 10 without shoes on, and hosted meetings in stockinged feet.

His controversial and radical views, including scrapping maternity leave, abolishing JobCentres, suspending consumer rights laws for nine months 'to see what would happen' and ignoring some EU employment regulations, drew strong criticism from all parties.

In March last year he announced he was taking a 12-month ‘sabbatical’ teaching at Stanford University in California.

Friends said he had become disillusioned with the difficulty of driving through reforms. He became so frustrated by the civil service that he tried to persuade Mr Cameron to slash the number of Whitehall officials by two-thirds – only to be blocked by the Cabinet Secretary.

His reported comments came during a lecture to students in California. Mr Hilton complained that the paperwork associated with everyday decisions was impossible for ministers and special advisers to wade through, so many policy changes were simply nodded through.

‘They can be quite trivial things but they can be quite serious as well, and they can certainly affect the real world,’ he said.

‘That’s how you end up with stuff happening that the Government is doing that the people running the Government don’t know about, or disagree with. When you start thinking about how things get decided, it’s pretty incredible... it’s a brilliant system for paper-shuffling people to be in control.’

Asked about the comments, a Government source said: ‘We don’t recognise the picture he has painted. It’s just Steve being Steve.’

But his description of life in No 10 is strikingly similar to that painted by Mr Cameron’s deputy chief of staff, Oliver Dowden, who said last year: ‘The first thing I do in the morning... is turn on the Today programme and hear what’s going on. Hopefully, we will have some sense of what’s coming up anyway, but often you’ll get surprised.’

Mr Cameron was critical of New Labour’s ‘control freak’ approach and determined to allow ministers more freedom. But No 10 has been wrong-footed by announcements on everything from selling off forests to scrapping school milk, which have had to be reversed.
