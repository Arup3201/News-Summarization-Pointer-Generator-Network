Billionaire George Soros has offered his Brazilian soap star ex-girlfriend $250,000 to 'persuade her' to drop a $50million lawsuit, it has been claimed.

Jilted actress Adriana Ferreyr, 31, launched legal proceedings against the 81-year-old mogul in August after he allegedly broke a promise to buy her a $1.9million apartment in Manhattan, New York.

The staggering lawsuit said she was emotionally tortured, harassed and abused by Soros, who denies all the claims - during an alleged fight when he told her he had given the apartment to another lover.

But now it has emerged that, when she threatened to take him to court, Soros approached his former lover's lawyer cousin Mauricio Carneiro with a cash offer.

An email obtained by the New York Daily News, from Soros' lawyer William Zabel to Carnerio, is reported to have made the offer.

It is said to have said: 'Pursuant to your conversation with George Soros... I understand you may wish to be helpful with the situation.'

Carneiro replied that he 'could not be bought' and was 'shocked that George called me to offer me $250,000 in order to get my sympathy, get rid of her lawyers and settle the case.'

Zabel admitted that the email had been sent, but that it was not a bribe.

He told the News: 'George had met him before and he liked him. He had reached out to him because he is a lawyer and a relative and he hoped to settle the case before it went to court. It is in no way a bribe.'

Jilted: Adriana Ferreyr is suing her ex for $50 million, claiming he physically abused her and broke a promise to buy her a home

Ferryr broke her silence in August about her five-year relationship with the financier known as the Man Who Broke the Bank of England after making millions during the 1992 UK currency crisis.

Despite
 their 53-year age gap, she insisted their relationship was 'respectful 
and loveable' before the acrimonious split, followed by her allegations 
of physical abuse.

Ferreyr, a former child actor and star of Portuguese McDonald’s commercials, first met Soros five years ago. She 
told the New York Post: 'For five years, he was my boyfriend. He was 
respectful and loveable. Then, suddenly, he changed and became cruel. I 
don't know why he would do this to me.'

'He treated me with a lot of 
respect,' she said. 'When we first started dating, I would see him every
 weekend at his house in Bedford. He was very nice, very sweet, very 
loveable... We travelled and went to St Bart's.

'As far as I was concerned, this 
was a proper, loving, committed relationship. He introduced me to people
 as his girlfriend after a year. We attended events. I met his friends. I
 met his business associates.

'Some people don't understand the
 age difference, but for me, it wasn't a problem. I wouldn't go out with
 a muscular guy who has tattoos, but I wouldn't call other people 
strange because they have different taste than me.

'He is a likeable person. He is 
outspoken. I spent a lot of time with him, and I had a lot of feelings 
for him. We had a happy, normal relationship,' she continued.

Ferreyr said she was 
monogamous during their time together, and was hoping to 'settle down' 
with Soros, who she said never lavished her with money or gifts 
during their first few years together.

Eventually, however, she said he offered 
to buy her an apartment. And she found her 'dream home' - a $1.9million 
condo at 30 E 85th St - just two streets from him.

'I did a lot of research on it. I
 made sure it was a good investment. I explained to him what good a deal
 it was, why I loved it, why it would be a great place to live.... 'He 
told me, "I am going to buy it. I am going to do this for you, "' she 
said.

But Ferreyr claims the day 
after they signed off on the paperwork in December, Soros had a 
change of heart, and offered the apartment to 39-year-old Tamiko Bolton, described as his 'travelling nurse'.

'We were in bed, and he just 
replied coldly and bluntly that he had given (the apartment) to his 
other girlfriend. I got emotional and cried... He just said, "I don't 
care." I was in bed with him. It was horrifying for me,' Ferreyr 
said.

The soap star has also claimed 
that Soros slapped her in the face and attempted to choke her as they
 argued over the property in bed together.

According to a lawsuit filed in 
Manhattan Supreme Court, in the inevitable row which followed, 'Soros
 slapped Ferreyr across the face and proceeded to put his hands 
around her neck in an attempt to choke her.'

Ferreyr claims she managed to evade him and picked up a glass lamp to protect herself. Soros then allegedly grabbed the lamp and tried to hit her with it, narrowly missing.

She claims she ran into the office next to Soros’s bedroom and called police. According to the lawsuit, Ferreyr claims Soros twice broke promises to buy her flats in the 
building - once again after a brief reconciliation.

'When... I saw him again, he was 
loving. We got back together and started dating again. Then he invited 
me for tea at his house. He said to me, 'Go look for an apartment. I owe
 you an apartment anyway,' she told the Post.

She said she found a $4.3million 
apartment in the same building. But when she told him about it he 
pretended to know nothing about it. To make matters worse, Ferryr and Bolton now live in the same New York apartment block.

And after learning his ex was 
going to rent a flat in the same building anyway, Soros hired private
 security men to ‘follow and intimidate’ her, Ferreyr claims.

Hungarian-born Soros, while being a notable philanthropist championing liberal 
causes, is also known as the 'Man Who Broke The Bank Of England'.

He
 made an estimated £600 million during the 1992 'Black Wednesday' UK 
currency crises, correctly predicting that the British government would 
have to devalue the pound.

On
 16 September, 1992, his fund sold short more than $10 billion worth of 
pounds, profiting from the UK government's reluctance to either raise 
its interest rates or float its currency - finally withdrawing from the 
European Exchange Rate Mechanism and devaluing the pound.

In 1997, the UK Treasury estimated the cost of Black Wednesday at £3.4 billion.

According to Ferreyr's suit, Soros ‘not only breached his multiple promises…but he proceeded to 
engage in a deliberate and malicious campaign of extreme and outrageous 
harassment and intimidation against Ferreyr, which has directly resulted
 in her suffering and continuing to suffer severe emotional distress and
 damages.'

She claims their confrontation 
traumatised her to the point she was ‘unable to function in her 
day-to-day life’ and that she has since had to have treatment for 
post-traumatic stress disorder.

Her lawyer, Robert Hantman, said 
it was unfortunate she had to resort to court action as she had hoped to
 settle the dispute privately. He said: ‘It’s 1/7000th of his wealth. 
She just wants what he promised her.’

Soros strongly denies the allegations.

William Zabel, Soros’s lawyer, called the suit ‘frivolous and entirely without merit’.

Although he admitted his client 
had an ‘on-again, off-again’ relationship with Ferreyr, he said the
 complaint was ‘riddled with false charges and is obviously an attempt 
to extract money from my client, who is known to be a very rich man’.

He added: ‘The police 
investigated the incident referred to and concluded that no assault 
occurred. George Soros did not slap, choke or throw a lamp at her.

A source close to Soros, whose birthday was yesterday, said: ‘This is nothing but a woman scorned who is out to get paid. These claims are outrageous and he will seek to dismiss them at the earliest opportunity.

‘George is dealing with this well – this is a man who survived the Holocaust. The suggestion he attacked her is without merit.’

Ferreyr remains undetoured. 'George is so powerful he thinks 
he can get rid of anyone he wants. But I am not going away. I am going 
to fight,' she told the Post.

Soros’s private life is rarely
 touched on in the U.S.

Married and twice divorced, he has five 
children.  In the past few years, his reported girlfriends have 
included the violinist Jennifer Chun and former Miss Russia Anna Malova.
