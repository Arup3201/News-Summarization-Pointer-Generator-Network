A Pit Bull puppy snatched from a teenage girl's bedroom in the middle of the night has been retrieved.

Alicia Daniels, 14, from Meriden, Connecticut, woke up at 4.30am on Sunday and found her pet dog Miyah had been taken while she was sleeping during a break-in.

After launching an appeal on Facebook and posting flyers in the neighborhood an anonymous tip-off via text message on Monday revealed the puppy was shacked up in a basement down the road.

Police told ABC News that they are still trying to determine how the dog ended up where she was found and no arrest has been made.

Alicia's mother, Carla, said the family was distraught when they discovered 19-week-old Miyah was missing. 

Her eldest daughter, Asheigh,17, apparently treats the animal like a 'baby' and Facebook photographs show her snuggling alongside her four-legged friend.

Scene of the crime: Besides snatching the dog, the thief also took a PlayStation 3, computer games and a laptop which remain uncovered

Finally back home: The Daniels were particularly concerned about the theft as Miyah has a series of health problems which require around-the-clock care

The Daniels were particularly concerned about the theft of Miyah because she has a series of health problems which require around-the-clock care.

They reported the break-in to authorities around 8.30am on Sunday.

Besides snatching the dog, the thief also took a PlayStation 3, computer games and a laptop which remain uncovered.      

Police returned Miyah to the Daniels  around 11pm Monday after a woman anonymously revealed her location.

The officers  joked that she gave Pit Bulls 'a bad name' because of her friendly nature.
