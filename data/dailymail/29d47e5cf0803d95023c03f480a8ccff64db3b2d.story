The man who inspired Jeff Bridges' Big Lebowski character The Dude is suing the hospital where his mother died for $10million.

Hollywood film producer Jeff Dowd, 65, claims poor communication between doctors caused his mother's rapid decline and death at UCLA Medical Centre.

She was admitted to the hospital with bronchitis last March and was dead within a month after suffering internal bleeding, dehydration and, finally, a massive stroke, the lawsuit says.

The original Dude: Jeff Dowd speaks at the 2014 Lebowski Fest in Los Angeles last week. The Hollywood producer is suing UCLA Medical Centre, claiming poor communication led to his mother's death there

Dowd told TMZ his mother was handed from one doctor to another without proper briefings on the medication she was taking, a breakdown in communication that he believes led to her death.

Dowd's anger at his mother's death, and his determination to do something about it, seems to be a long way from his laid-back depiction in the Joel and Ethan Coen's film The Big Lebowski.

Released in 1998 but set in the early '90s, the film tells the story of Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski, an unemployed LA slacker who, after a case of mistaken identity, finds himself embroiled in a kidnap for ransom plot.

Although the plot is fictional, and loosely based on the work of crime novellist Raymond Chandler, the character of The Dude is based on Dowd, who had long worked with the Coen Brothers.

Dowd has said that Jeff Bridges' portrayal of The Dude - his own nickname from sixth-grade - is accurate, right down to the body language.

'Lemme say something about Jeff. I'm born on November 20, 1949, Jeff is born on December 3, 1949,' he told Huffington Post last year.

'This means, every time he heard a song for the first time growing up, whether it was in sixth grade, or eighth grade, or tenth grade, that was the same day I heard it for the first time.

'So we're very closely hooked ... and he's a stoner too, so it wasn't a stretch for Jeff to play me. In terms of philosophically, spiritually, all that kind of stuff, that's who he kind of naturally is.'

Bridges was actually born on December 4.

Dowd fell in with the Coen Brothers when they were promoting their first film Blood Simple in 1984. His idiosyncratic character inspired the character of The Dude in The Big Lebowski, played by Jeff Bridges, right

Not a slacker: Dowd is regarded in Hollywood as a film marketing and distribution guru, as well as working as a producer, a writer, and helping Robert Redford start the Sundance Film Festival

But although The Big Lebowski's Dude is an inveterate slacker, the real Dude could not be further from lazy. He is also no stranger to activism.

In the 1970s he first shot into the public eye as a member of the Seattle Seven. That was a group of young radicals who were indicted on charges of inciting riot in connection with a violent anti-Vietnam War protest.

Although he was briefly jailed for contempt of court, he and his co-defendants were cleared of the riot charges after government witnesses admitted they would 'go to any length' to fight the radicals.

Some years later Dowd moved to Los Angeles, where he fell in with the then relatively unknown Coen Brothers while they were promoting their first film Blood Simple in 1984.

Since then, he has earned an enviable reputation as a film marketing and distribution guru, as well as working as a producer and producer's representative, a writer, and helping Robert Redford start the Sundance Film Festival.

Now, spurred on by his mother's treatment, Dowd is turning some of that energy towards righting the wrongs he perceives in America's healthcare industry.

He says he wants to reform the way that medical staff communicate and, in so doing, save hundreds of thousands of people he says die every year from similar kinds of failures.

Dowd is also suing a convalescent home over his mother's death.

UCLA Medical Centre has made no comment on the lawsuit.
