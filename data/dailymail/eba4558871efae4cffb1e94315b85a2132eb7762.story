This is professional flyboarder Damone Rippy who has honed his gravity-defying skills at just 16-years-old and is winning international competitions despite still being in high school.

Rippy was the youngest competitor at the Flyboard North American Championships, held in Toronto, Canada earlier this year. 

But his age clearly means nothing in the water - storming to success and critical acclaim at the tournament while competing against flyboarders more than double his age.

The Texas-based teenager trains twice a week and came fourth in the 2013 Doha World Cup performing incredible stunts such as back flips at around 40 feet above the water.

The high school student is still beaming from his win in Toronto in June but admits he doesn't get much attention at school despite his sporting prowess.

'Before we went to Qatar in November last year some of my football friends and coaches made me a poster for good luck. But really it not a big deal to most people,' he said.

'The hardest part for me is trying to not miss school for the competitions and various events I want to attend,' he added.

'Luckily, I haven't incurred any major injures...I definitely hurt my ribs and back everyone in a while and have various cuts and bruises but no major injuries,' Rippy went on to say.

Stunts: Flyboarding involves a long hose being attached to a board, out of which a jet of water is fired at such extreme pressure that the board can fly up to 15 metres in the air - allowing the rider to perform tricks

He says he fell in love with the sport 'the second I put in the boots on', but remains aware of the dangers - admitting he is lucky not have have picked up any injuries so far.

'The risks increase as I get more competitive... The higher I go the higher the risk. You fall harder and are more uncontrolled,' Rippy said.

'You think because you are just falling into water, it doesn't hurt as bad. But that isn't always true,' he added.

The thought of going to college has not even entered Rippy's head and he knows what the future holds - more flyboarding.

'That's all I want to do... I want to push the limits and continue to do my very best. I love this sport,' he said.

Flyboarding is a very modern sport - having only been invented in 2011 by French watercraft rider, Franky Zapata.

It involves a long, powerful hose being attached to a board, out of which a jet of water is fired at a pressure so great that the board flies up to 15 metres in the air - allowing the rider to perform tricks.
