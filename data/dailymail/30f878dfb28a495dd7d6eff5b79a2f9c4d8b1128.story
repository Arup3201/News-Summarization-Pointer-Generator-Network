Forget paracetamol or honey and lemon. Listening to Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody is the best way to feel better when unwell, according to a new survey.

As part of a new poll, almost 90 per cent of people agreed that listening to a good tune can make people feel better when they are sick or facing difficult times.

More than 80 per cent said that in the past, music had made them personally feel better when they were sick or feeling low.

Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody (sung by Freddie Mercury, pictured) was voted as the top track to listen to when feeling unwell or depressed

Bohemian Rhapsody, from British rock band Queen, is the nation’s favourite song for listening to when struck down by illness, or the blues, the poll revealed.

The 1975 hit is almost six minutes long and moves through several sections, including a ballad segment ending in a guitar solo, an opera passage and a hard rock section.

It was written by lead singer Freddie Mercury for the band's Night at the Opera album, the most expensive single ever made at the time it was recorded. 

Out of a choice of ten songs, Bohemian Rhapsody was the most popular for male Britons (29 per cent) but was less popular among women (23 per cent)

Dancing Queen by Abba came second, as it was the most popular song for women (28 per cent).

Only 16 per cent of men named the Swedish pop group’s 1976 hit as their favourite.

Pharrell Williams’ 2013 hit Happy - which was number one in 25 countries - came joint third with ‘classical music’ generally.

The upbeat soul track was most popular for younger people aged 18 – 34 (30 per cent), while classical music (39 per cent) and Dancing Queen (31 per cent ) were voted most popular for over-65s.

Almost 70 per cent of people agreed they like to listen to music when they don't feel well, and only 36 per cent said they prefer listening to speech than music when they don't feel well.

Other favourite  tracks include Let it Be by the Beatles, Three Little Birds by Bob Marley and Angels by Robbie Williams.

Michael Jackson's Billie Jean, Elvis Presley's The Wonder of You and Frank Sinatra's My Way were a

The ComRes survey - of 1,000 people - was carried out to mark the BBC Radio 2’s Faith in the World Week whose theme this year is the ‘healing power of music’.

Previous research has found that listening to sad but beautiful songs by the likes of Johnny Cash or Leonard Cohen can also help you beat the blues.

University of Kent psychologists found that depressed or sad people prefer to listen to beautiful music that triggers important memories, and choosing music identified as ‘beautiful’ was the only way to stop them feeling glum.

More than 80 per cent of people polled said music had made them feel better when they felt sad or unwell
