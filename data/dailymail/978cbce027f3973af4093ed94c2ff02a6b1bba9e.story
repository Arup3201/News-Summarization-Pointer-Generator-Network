Cristiano Ronaldo has finally picked up his Golden Shoe award for his scintillating form last season.

The Real Madrid star fired in 31 La Liga goals for Los Blancos last season, narrowly missing out on the title to city rivals Atletico.

This is Ronaldo’s third Golden Shoe award, presented to the leading goal scorer in league matches from Europe’s top divisions, having previously won in 2008 and 2011.

Ronaldo shared his award with Barcelona striker Luis Suarez, who picked up his Golden Shoe last month having scored 31 times in the Premier League for Liverpool last season.

According to reports in the Spanish media, Ronaldo shunned collecting his award in the same ceremony as Suarez, who joined El Clasico rivals Barcelona this summer. The former Liverpool striker accepted his Golden Shoe at a ceremony last month in Barcelona.

Ronaldo adds more to his trophy cabinet having clinched La Liga Player of the Year award last week.
