Chris Christie could not bring himself to watch his hero Bruce Springsteen sing a mocking duet with Late Night host Jimmy Fallon about the beleaguered New Jersey governor following his 'Bridgegate' scandal, it has been revealed. 

The song, 'Governor Chris 
Christie's Fort Lee, New Jersey Traffic Jam', joked about Christie's 
involvement in the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge last
 September.

The New Jersey governor could not stomach watching the comic song based on the Springsteen classic Born To Run.

Taking a joke: Chris Christie was told by his son Andrew that the Bruce Springsteen skit was funny after he couldn't bring himself to watch it

However Christie's 20-year-old son Andrew told him the skit was funny, the New York Times reported.

Springsteen
 and Fallon took to the stage last week dressed in ensembles reminiscent of 
Springsteen's 'Born in the U.S.A.' era - denim shirts, red bandanas and 
aviator sunglasses.

Emails emerged earlier this month revealing Christie's aides punished Fort 
Lee's mayor for refusing to endorse their boss by snarling commuter 
traffic entering his town by the bridge.

'Oh
 maybe this Bridgegate was just pay back,' Fallon sang. 'It's a b**** 
slap to the state democrats. We gotta get out but we cant - we're stuck 
in Chris Christe's Fort Lee New Jersey traffic jam.'

Springsteen joined in: 'You got Wall Street masters stuck cheek to cheek with blue collared truckers.

'And man I really gotta take a leak but I can't, I'm stuck in Governor 
Chris Christie's Fort Lee, New Jersey traffic jam.'

'The 
press conference went on and on,' Fallon continued - referring to 
Christie's apology on the scandal, which stretched to more than an hour.

Rocking out: The duo sang about the long waits that commuters had to endure on the George Washington Bridge following closures, with Springsteen adding: 'Man, I really gotta take a leak'

Fallon: 'In the day we sweated out on the streets, stuck in traffic on the GWB,

'They shut down the tollbooths of glory because we didn't endorse Christie.

'Maybe this Bridgegate was just payback, it was a b**** slap to the state Democrats.

'We got to get out while we can, We’re stuck in Gov. Chris Christie's Fort Lee, N.J., traffic jam.'

Springsteen: 'Governor let me in, I want to be your friend, there'll be no partisan divisions.

'Let me wrap your legs 'round your mighty ribs, relieve your stressful condition.

'You got wall street masters stuck cheek to cheek with blue collared truckers.

'Man I really gotta take a leak, but I can't, I'm stuck in Gov. Chris Christie's Fort Lee, N.J., traffic jam.'

Springsteen later added of Christie's apology: 'It was longer than one of my own damn shows.'

'It was longer than one of my 
own damn shows,' Springsteen added as the song wrapped up. 'I gotta take a leak. I really gotta take a leak.'

Christie has long been vocal about his love for The Boss.

In 2012, he said he had been to 129 concerts held by Springsteen, The Star-Ledger reported.

Christie later appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and sang a duet of Thunder Road with the host.

He met and shared a hug with his idol during a benefit for Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

According to Christie, Springsteen then said: 'It's official. We're friends.'

The sudden closure of three bridge on-ramp lanes backed up traffic throughout the New Jersey town for four days in September, trapping children in school buses and angering commuters.

After the emails emerged, Christie denied having any knowledge of the decision and fired a deputy chief of staff and dismissed a long-time political aide who ran his 2013 re-election campaign.
