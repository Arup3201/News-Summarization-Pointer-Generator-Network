A number of Australians remain missing in the Himalayas where the toll of trekkers confirmed or feared dead since a snowstorm hit last week has reached 40.

Twelve more bodies were found on Sunday as Nepalese rescue teams using helicopters scoured a popular route around Annapurna, the world's 10th highest peak, hit by a blizzard and avalanches on October 14.

Almost 500 people - trekkers, guides and others have been rescued since operations started on Wednesday, including 292 foreigners and teams were preparing to resume their search on Monday for about 40 people still unaccounted for, including several Australians, with reports that number could be as high as 23.

A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said no Australian casualties had been reported but the embassy in Kathmandu was seeking information about the welfare of Australians in the affected area.

"Embassy staff remain ready to assist any Australians affected by this tragedy. Nepalese authorities continue to advise there are no reports of Australian casualties, so far," the spokesperson said.

Several foreigners, including Australians, had been rescued but authorities would not confirm the number of Australians still missing.

A Fairfax Media report said an unofficial website set up by families and friends of trekkers listed 23 Australians as still missing, including Sydney father Simon Wilde and his daughter, Sophie, 17, who had not made contact with family since October 6.

Four helicopters were sent out Sunday to the affected areas in Mustang, Manang and Dolpa with a police official saying 34 trekkers were rescued, including 17 Nepalese, 10 Germans, five Swedes and two Australians.

Nepal has pledged to set up a weather warning system after the snowstorm caught trekkers unaware as they heading to an exposed high mountain pass on the circuit.

The disaster follows Mount Everest's deadliest avalanche that killed 16 guides in April on the world's highest peak, forcing an unprecedented shutdown.
