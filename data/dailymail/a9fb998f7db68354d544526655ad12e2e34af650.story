Settled: Lisa Tchenguiz and Vivian Imerman's four-year-long battle is over - and she gets £15m

She was reportedly demanding £100million to divorce the drinks magnate known as The Man from Del Monte.

But yesterday it was announced that film producer Lisa Tchenguiz, 48, will receive a fraction of that sum from Vivian Imerman.

However, the £15million settlement 
still amounts to more than £2million a year for the six years she was 
together with one of Britain’s richest men, who sold the fruit juice 
firm for £380million in 1999.

However, legal fees for the four-year 
dispute are estimated at around £5million for each side.

The agreement brings to an end one of the country’s lengthiest and most bitter divorce battles, which went all the way to the Court of Appeal.

It also led to a major change in the law, branded the ‘cheat’s charter’ because it gave wealthy men the right to hide assets from their wives.

In a statement, Mr Imerman said that following negotiations, the pair had reached a ‘full and final settlement’ which he believed was in the ‘best interests of their daughter’.

He added: ‘In order to avoid unnecessary, unfair and inaccurate speculation as to the terms of settlement and, given that such speculation has already found its way into the press, Mr Imerman confirms that he will pay a lump sum to Ms Tchenguiz of £15m in instalments, with no order for costs.’

He said his conduct had been ‘dignified’ throughout the proceedings and that he would not comment further, asking for his privacy to be respected.

South African born Mr Imerman became known as ‘The Man from Del Monte’ after he sold a stake in the fruit juice firm for £380 million in 1999.

He married Lisa Tchenguiz, the younger sister of property tycoons Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz in 2001 after she separated from Radio 1 disc jockey Gary Davies.

The couple signed a pre-nuptial agreement which would have left her with nothing more than she came into the relationship with. But she asked for more because his fortune had increased in the time they were married.

They separated in 2007 and in 2008 she petitioned for divorce after alleging he had been having an affair with his former wife.

She sought £100million in what would have been the largest divorce settlement in British legal history at the time.

On top of his fruit juice fortune, he made £396million in 2007 by selling the whisky group Whyte & Mackay.

When
 they split Mr Imerman, 58, was sharing a Mayfair office with her 
brothers. Following the divorce petition, Robert Tchenguiz made 
electronic copies of emails and other documents stored by Mr Imerman on 
his office computer.

He is thought to have downloaded between 250,000 and 2.5 million pages and claimed he was concerned to protect his sister’s interests, fearing Mr Imerman would try to hide his assets from his wife.

But in 2010, he successfully argued that her side had no right to retain or use material downloaded without his knowledge.

Divorce lawyers said the decision would mean wealthy men can hide their assets from their wives with impunity.

A source close to Mr Imerman, who once stood at no 184 in Britain’s rich list, said: ‘He always wanted to give her something that was fair and reasonable’.

It is understood that separate financial arrangements were made earlier to provide for their 10 year old daughter which were not subject of the divorce proceedings.

She reportedly celebrated her 48th birthday last month at a party thrown by her American aircraft entrepreneur boyfriend Steve Varsano.

The biggest divorce in English legal history is thought to be the £100million payout from oligarch Boris Berezovsky to his ex-wife Galina Besharova in 2011.
