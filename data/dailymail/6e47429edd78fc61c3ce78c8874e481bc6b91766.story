The ASPCA adoption center has four doggies in need of a loving home--all adorably dressed in ugly holday sweaters!

Most of the canine cuties haven't been able to find a home for a while, hence the ASPCAs decorated efforts to help them find loving owners this holiday season.

Dream, Douglas, Marilyn, Baby, and Spice can be yours if you contact the ASPCA and apply to adopt a furry friend.One dog named, Sophia, has already been adopted! Gothamist published an article showcasing each dog's geek chic look.

Dream dog: Dream is  5-year-old Maltese who wants to play with you on Christmas

Dream, a 5-year-old white Maltese absolutely dazzles in a royal blue holiday sweater. ASPCA describes him as being a 'goofball' and says that he is a 'happy-all-the-time, glass-is-half-full kind of dog looking for someone who loves to laugh and play around.'

Dream is diabetic and requires special loving attention. He requires two injections daily which will cost his owner just $100 per month. While Dream loves humans, he can something bark at other dogs (to protect you of course) so would do better as a single pet. Check out Dream's page here.

Douglas, a 10-year old Pomeranian Mix, can't wait to cuddle with you. He looks absolutely snug in a green elf inspired sweater sporting bells on the collar and a black belt across the tummy.

He's very mellow and loves to hang out on the couch. Even though Douglas has arthritis and some vison problems, he still likes to go on walks. He's a perfect dog for someone who will groom him to keep him comfortable and is a great TV buddy. He would benefit from a household with children 12 and up. Read more about Douglas here.

Marilyn is a glamorous 6-year-old Shih Tzu Mix who looks impossibly cuter in a green sweater with a little stuffed teddy bear sewn on the back. Marilyn feels lonely when she doesn't have anyone to cuddle with her and would do well with an affectionate owner who doesn't leave her at home for long hours.

Marilyn is blind because she had to have an eye removed due to glaucoma and requires daily eye drops to ensure her health. ASPCA says she'll do best in a home that doesn't have other dogs around and that has children 10 and up. Check out Marilyn's page here.

Are you my Mommy? Baby is 7-year-old Pit Bull Terrier Mix who already loves you and every human on Earth

Baby is a 7-year-old Pit Bull Terrier Mix, although in this bright red sweater with a reindeer on the back, he could be mistaken for Rudolph! According to the ASPCA, Baby loves, 'every human on Earth.'

She prefers to be around people and likes other dogs that she gets to know 'one-on one.' She'd do best in a home with children ages 10 and up. Check out her page here.

The 2-year-old American Pit Bull Terrier named Spice was featured on the ASPCA's website on Friday. He came to the ASPCA in 2011 after living in a dirty basement without food or water.Their website says that Spice was only 32 pounds when he arrived at the ASPCA Animal Hospital. He now weighs 54 pounds and is in great condition to be hugged and adored.

'This sweet dog could not be friendlier. He would thrive in a home with an energetic adopter who’ll take the time to play with him. He already knows Sit, and loves to learn new tricks. Whether you’re looking to add a new furry friend to your household or know a friend who might be willing to give Spice a chance, we’d love to have your help in spreading the word. Please share this flyer on your Facebook, Twitter, blog and other social networks. Together we can find Spice a home for the holidays!' reads the ASPCA site.

In a video promoting Spice's adoption, an ASPCA worker says that 'Spice will stay by your side all day,' and that he absolutely loves to have his belly scratched. He's not the only dog who loves a good rub on the tummy.

Sophia is a 4-year-old Pekinges with a face that could bring anyone to their knees. She looks ready to party in a bright red holiday sweater with a christmas tree on the back. According to ASPCA's website, she been adopted! See her page here.
