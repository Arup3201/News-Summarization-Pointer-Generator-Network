The former guardians of one of the two high school football stars accused of raping a 16-year-old girl while she was drunk and unconscious have revealed they are standing by him.

Greg and Jennifer Agresta welcomed Ma'lik Richmond, who had played sports with their sons, into their home for two years when he was eight and living in a troubled home.

In a case that has sparked protests in Steubenville, Ohio, he now stands accused of kidnapping and sexually abusing the unnamed girl after carrying her to multiple parties in the town last August.

He was even photographed carrying the victim by her wrists and ankles with his co-defendant, fellow student and high school football player Trenton Mays, as other teenagers looked on.

Defiant: Jennifer and Greg Agresta appeared on the Today show to say they would be standing by Ma'lik Richmond, who is accused of raping an Ohio teen. He previously lived with the Agresta family

But speaking on the Today show, the Agrestas said they love Richmond whatever he might have done - and have not even asked him if he is guilty of the crimes of which he is accused.

'It doesn't matter to us,' Mrs Agresta said. 'We love him, 
irregardless of what happened that evening. We want him to know that we 
support him.

'When he left our home as a young child, the last thing I 
said to him when I dropped him off was, "Ma'lik, if you ever need anything,
good or bad, we are a phone call away". And when he called us, we were 
just that phone call away. We had to be there for him.'

The Agrestas became Richmond's legal guardians after his own parents were unable to take care of him. He has now returned to their home and is under house arrest there.

Love: Speaking to Matt Lauer with their lawyer present, the Agrestas said they love Richmond regardless

When they learned that he was implicated in the alleged sexual assaults, they were stunned.

'I think everybody was surprised,' Mrs Agresta said. 'It's out of character for Ma'lik. I think everybody just was in shock.'

Her husband added: 'It's completely out of Ma'lik's 
character. That's not the type of person that he is.'

Mr Agresta added that, while it was a struggle for him and his wife to step forward, they knew it was the right thing to do for the teenager.

'Too many
people want to share the good times and when individuals and family 
members run across difficult times, right or wrong, they want to bail,' he said.

Richmond’s attorney, Walter Madison, joined the Agrestas but declined to discuss the accuracy of the charges. He did admit that Richmond is in the picture of the girl being carried by the two teens.

Part of the family: Richmond lived with the Agrestas and their two sons for two years when he was younger

'Out of character': They claimed that their friends were shocked by Richmond's alleged part in the attack

Nearly 1,000 people gathered in Steubenville over the weekend to protest the 
handling of the alleged gang rape. The two teenagers say all sexual contact that occurred was consensual.

The case has sparked fury both in the
rural town and across the country as those involved have  effectively 
been accused by social media, even though police have only arrested the pair.

The
backlash has echoes of the international outrage triggered by the death
of 23-year-old Jyoti Singh Pandey, who died as a result of the massive 
injuries sustained during a brutal gang rape at the hands of six men in 
Delhi, India.

In Ohio, only the two teens have been charged, though many believe 
that there is a cover up underway to keep more players from the beloved 
high school football team from being arrested.

Over the weekend, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said officially that no further suspects would be charged.

Tension: Many in the community believe police have failed to fully investigate an allegation of rape. Two high school football players have been arrested following the alleged sex attack

Picking sides: Members of 'hacktivist' group Anonymous- seen wearing 
their trademark masks- have taken on the Steubenville case because they 
feel there is a police cover up protecting other people involved

Anger: Up to 1,000 people protested at Jefferson County Courthouse in Steubenville, Ohio, today. They believe local police have failed to fully investigate a 16-year-old's rape allegations to protect the local football program

'There
was more than two kids involved. The kids who have money in this town 
have not been arrested,' demonstrator Lisa Waxler said.

Beliefs like that have prompted
defense attorneys to call for serious changes in the case before any 
trial takes place. Lawyer Walter Madison wants to move the trial to a 
different town because activists simply want to draw blood and have less
concern for what is truly justified. '

What we have in this county is a legal lynching and I can't stand for that on my watch,' he told NBC.

The party where 
the alleged rape took place dates back to just 
before the school year began at Steubenville High School - but the case 
did not garner national attention until recently.

A sect of the 
hacker group Anonymous took on the case and have scoured the internet 
for various photos and videos posted by students who were at one of the 
three parties.

Laughing: A video from the night of the alleged attack shows Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student, laughing callously and referring to a girl getting raped because she is so drunk 

One video shows an 18-year-old man laughing and joking over the fate of the alleged rape victim in a leaked YouTube video.

Abdalla, who said he first saw the video three days ago, commented: 'It's a disgusting video. It's stupidity. But you can't 
arrest somebody for being stupid.'

The attorney for the 18-year-old man in the video, Michael Nodianos, called the teenager's behaviour 'disappointing, insensitive and unfortunate' on Monday night.

Speaking at a brief press conference 
Dennis McNamara sought to distance his client from the horrific events 
alleged to have taken place in Steubenville.

Mr
McNamara said, 'After some sober reflection he is ashamed and 
embarrassed himself. He's sorry to victims and his family. He was not 
raised to act in this manner.'

Anonymous: The online activist group organized a
protest in Steubenville yesterday. They accuse police of failing to 
thoroughly investigate an allegation of rape. County Sheriff Fred 
Abdalla, pictured left, defended officers yesterday, as hundreds, 
including many in the group's trademark masks, pictured right, 
demonstrated

Accused: Two 16-year-old members of the Steubenville Big Red football team are charged with rape. Protesters in the city yesterday said the police hadn't fully investigated the allegations in order to protect the team

It
also emerged on Monday that Mr Nodianos has been forced to drop out of 
Ohio State University, where he was on athletic scholarship, after 
receiving numerous threats.

Mr McNamara insisted that his client had
not been in the house at the time of the alleged attack but had arrived
as the girl was being taken out of the house.

Ohio Attorney General Mike 
DeWine called the posting 'despicable' but said it didn't constitute
new evidence for local investigators, who were aware of it before the 
posting.

The accused two students will be tried as juveniles on February 13.
