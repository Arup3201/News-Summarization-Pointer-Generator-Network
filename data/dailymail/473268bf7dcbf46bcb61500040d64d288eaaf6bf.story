Twisted, snapped and buckled, a once sinuous strip of black tarmac has been contorted into the most unimaginable shapes and structures.

Deep cracks criss-cross the road next to perilous cliffs where the right of way has shifted vertically below where cars once drove safely along a main road in Derbyshire.

Amazingly, the abandoned half-mile long section of road has become one of the county’s busiest tourist routes as cyclists, walkers and off-road bikers are being drawn to explore the challenges of the disused road.

The A625 was closed to traffic in 1979 after road repairers eventually gave up a losing battle against a landslide that has slowly been moving down a hillside for thousands of years.

Looking like they have been randomly sketched on the road surface, many of the road’s original white lines, now point in haphazard directions separated by deep fissures in the tarmac.

Mountain-biker Pete Tye, 43, who was riding the road with his son today, said: 'It’s an amazing place to ride – it’s got some really challenging sections and jumps.

'Although it’s not just mountain bikers that are using it – I’ve seen a couple of road bikes, loads of walkers and a couple of motorbikes up here today too.

'Some people are using this as a route to link up other trails and paths and others are just coming up here to experience the broken road.'

Lying below Mam Tor, the road was built in 1819 linking Castleton and Chapel-en-le-Frith in the Peak District.

Also known locally as ‘The New Road’, the new section bypassed the steeper Winnats Pass route and crossed the ancient Mam Tor landslip.

As a result of further movement, major road works were required in 1912, 1933, 1946, 1952 and 1966. In 1974 large parts of the Mam Tor section collapsed during a massive landslip.

More road works were carried out but the
force of millions of tons of rock pushing the road further downhill 
could not be stopped and eventually the road was abandoned to nature.Motorists now have to use Winnats pass again as another route around the narrow pass has not been built.

The 'old A625' has now become a favourite spot for ramblers and cyclists, especially off-road bikers

Geological
research suggests the Mam Tor landslide happened 3500 to 4000 years ago
and the average downward movement of the landslide is about 25 
centimetres per year but this movement increases considerably during a 
very wet winter following a significantly wet summer.

The landslide is about 1000 metres 
long, the top is about 300 metres across and the spread increases at the
bottom to about 450 metres. Maximum thickness of the landslide is about
40 metres.

At a rough estimate the landslide 
contains about 15 million cubic metres of slipping debris weighing in 
the region of 45 million tonnes.

The
speed of the landslide appears to be increasing. Professor of 
Structural Geology, Ernest Rutter, warned: 'Since 1880 the lower arm of 
the highway has moved over 40 metres downhill.'

The Manchester University academic monitors the landslide with probes buried near the old road added: 'The amount of sliding over the winter months is about one meter in the centre of the slide, with a local anomaly of high slip near the upper car park – which we keep a close eye on because it is likely to become more unstable with time.

'It seems likely that the present-day relatively rapid rates of movement in the Mam Tor slide are related to higher winter ground-water levels in recent centuries than for much of the time since the landslide first formed.'

On the Castleton Historical Society website a post warns: 'I wouldn’t be at all surprised if we woke up one day and found the whole lot down in the bottom'.
