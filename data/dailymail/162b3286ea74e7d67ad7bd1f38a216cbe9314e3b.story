Barcelona have unveiled their new home kit for the 2014-15 season, uniting stars from the present first team and the future talent of the club as they look to the future after losing the La Liga title on the final day of the season to Atletico Madrid.

The home shirt, manufactured by Nike, features bolder and wider Barcelona stripes in darker tones of red and blue.

Old and new: Xavi, Edgar Ie, Gerard Pique, Sergi Samper, Andres Iniesta, Neymar, Lionel Messi, Jean Marie Dongou Tsafack and Sergio Busquets pose in the new kit

Representing: The shirt, made by Nike, sports the Catalan colours in the V neck pattern

FC Barcelona B-team players Sergi Samper, Edgar Ie and Jean Marie Dongou Tsafack joined first-team stars Neymar, Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique, Xavi, Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets to unveil the new kit.

The shirt boasts a new crest, and a unique relaxed blue collar showcasing a Senyera flag in the open V-neck.

It is the first time the Catalan flag has appeared on the front of the club’s shirt.  

Inside the back of the neck is a blue pennant tab with Barcelona’s club motto: 'Mes que un club' (More than a club) and their founding year of 1899.

Reclaim: Barca are hoping they will be lifting the La Liga title in this kit next season

Barcelona appointed their former midfielder Luis Enrique as their new manager on Monday after Gerardo Martini's departure.

The 44-year-old, who led Celta Vigo this season, has agreed a two-year deal to take over from Martino, who left his position after just one campaign in charge.

The Catalan club said in a statement on their official website: 'The FC Barcelona board of directors have this evening confirmed Luis Enrique Martineza as the new first-team coach, following a proposal from sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta.'

In the past: Barcelona couldn't beat Atletico on Saturday, meaning Diego Simeone's side won La Liga
