Guy Luzon is the hot favourite for the Charlton Athletic job but former boss Jose Riga is keen for a return.

Luzon is a 39-year-old Israeli that has managed Maccabi Petah Tikva, Hapoel Tel Aviv, Beni Yehuda in his homeland between 2001 and 2010, before coaching the Israeli Under-21 side for three years.

Most recently, he managed Standard Liege in Belgium, where he secured a second place finish last season. However, he left in October after a terrible start to the season saw Liege in 12th position. It is understood that the club have made contact with Luzon and a deal could even be completed within 48 hours.

Guy Luzon is tipped to be the next Charlton manager following Bob Peeters' sacking on Sunday

Charlton are owned by Belgian businessman Roland Duchatelet, who has appointed managers with links to his country since taking over last year. Chris Powell was sacked in March 2013 to make way for Belgian Jose Riga, who then exited at the end of the season, before Bob Peeters took over in the summer.

The Belgian was sacked last week after guiding the club through a dreadful run in the Championship, with Charlton winning only two of their last 15 matches.

Riga was particularly popular with the Charlton fans, keeping them in the Championship with seven wins in their final 15 games.

Jose Riga managed Charlton during 2014 and won seven of his 16 games in charge of The Addicks

Riga would be happy to return to The Valley and is particularly eager to stay in English football after turning down several job offers in his native Belgium.

His representative Chris Nathaniel told Sportsmail: 'Jose is now feeling refreshed and ready for a new challenge. He has an existing affinity with Charlton and their fans.'

Charlton declined to comment.
