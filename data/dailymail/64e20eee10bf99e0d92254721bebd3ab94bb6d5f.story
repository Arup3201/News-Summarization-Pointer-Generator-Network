London’s Eccleston Square Hotel is billed as one of the most high-tech hotels in the world - with large 3D TVs, touch pad controls, a luxurious massage bed and a slick app that puts everything at guests' fingertips.

That title is warranted as the cutting-edge boutique hotel in Belgravia offers the perfect blend of modern comfort, privacy and gadgetry that novice tech users will be able to master in no time.

For a small, family-owned operation, it competes with larger hotels with similar features thanks to its warm hospitality, keen attention to detail and convenient in-room technology that is designed to provide a seamless stay.

Each room boasts large 3D TVs, touch pad controls, a luxurious massage bed and an iPad with a slick app that manages guests' stay

Touch pads in every room control the lighting, floor-to-ceiling curtains, temperature and a do not disturb signal in the hallway

In terms of technology this was the smartest boutique hotel I have ever slept in, and that is going to pose a big problem going forward.

Future stays in not-so-technologically advanced hotels are ruined thanks to my one-night stay at Eccleston Square Hotel.

Almost everything is controlled by touch pads - the floor-to-ceiling curtains, room temperature and lighting included. Even the ‘Do Not Disturb’ signal can be activated with the press of a button on a panel next to the bed.

The button activates a signal in the hallway outside the room, so there’s no need to get up and hang a sign on the door handle.

Signature king guestrooms offer a private outdoor patio, a large desk area, a large bathroom or a balcony overlooking Eccleston Square

Of all the things controlled by touch pads, my favourite feature was one that offers privacy when nature calls or it’s time for a scrub.

With the press of a button, the bathroom’s see-through glass wall and door instantly frost over. A second tap of the button makes the glass transparent again.

It was a fun feature to play with and one that I would love to have at home.

My signature king room had a generous walk-in shower that boasts three shower heads, including a high-pressure double rainfall shower head that provided an incredible relaxing soak.

Each room is supplied with an iPad that is pre-loaded with the hotel's app, which allows guests to order room service or request housekeeping

The marble bathroom is outfitted with heated floors and a steam-proof mirror that has a built-in TV screen synced to the 46in 3D TV.

One of the biggest selling features - especially for those looking for a great night’s sleep - is the Rolls Royce of beds: a luxury, hand-made Hastens massage bed that retails for more than £12,000 and is fitted with comfortable Rivolta Carmignani fine bed linen.

A remote control at the bedside switches on its massage feature - head, feet or both in unison - and adjusts the intensity of the vibration while allowing the bed to be raised or lowered to the perfect position for sleeping or watching TV.

While the massage mode is pleasant I found the noise to be a bit too loud and distracting.

A touch pad provides privacy in the bathroom; with the press of a button the see-through glass wall becomes opaque

When guests aren’t playing with the remote they can pick up an iPad (there’s one in every room) and swipe through the hotel’s concierge app, which manages almost every detail of their stay.

Before I arrived I downloaded the app to my smartphone to get a better sense of the amenities and services offered at Eccleston Square Hotel.

While it's one thing to play around with the app beforehand, one doesn't fully appreciate it until they walk through the hotel’s front door (which is equipped with sensors and swings open automatically, of course).

Guests can use Eccleston Square Hotel's official app or call the reception desk to have a 3D Blue-ray film delivered by staff

On my first night I used the app to request a wake-up call and to have a 3D Blu-ray film delivered to my room. An employee from the front desk arrived within minutes with the film in hand, plus two pairs of 3D glasses.

The following morning I used the app to browse the breakfast menu – still in my pyjamas – and have a full English delivered to my room - without having to pick up the phone and call the reception desk.

With the app guests can select the exact time that they want their order to arrive - a feature that is incredibly handy for those who want a hot meal or boozy drink delivered to their room when they return from a long day of shopping, touring or sitting in business meetings.

For meetings or private functions Eccleston Square Hotel offers a media lounge with a 103in LED TV and enough space for up to 14 people

Eccleston Square Hotel's restaurant, Bistrot on the Square, offers afternoon tea with a selection of delicious finger sandwiches

Open daily, the restaurant features theatrical black crystal chandeliers and an open fireplace and large comfortable chairs

Guests can also use the digital concierge to make reservations at Eccleston Square Hotel’s restaurant - Bistrot on the Square - submit housekeeping requests, organise health and beauty appointments, or arrange for a complimentary pot of tea to be delivered to them.

It may seem lazy but it's right up my alley. I would rather tap a few buttons on an iPad or mobile phone than call down to the front desk when ordering room service or requesting a wake-up call.

Of the very few negatives about my stay, it took some time to master the 3D TV’s smart remote and my room was located next to the lift. I regularly heard its chimes as it stopped on the first floor.

Eccleston Square Hotel was ahead of the curve with its integration of technology and comfort (a lot of hotels are still playing catch-up) and it has earned high praise and a handful of awards.

The restaurant serves a variety of cocktails, while guests can choose from an a la carte menu, weekend brunch menu or breakfast menu

With the app guests can select the exact time that they want their order - be it breakfast or a boozy drink - to arrive at their room

While it is perfect for tech lovers, it is also ideal for a romantic night in.

For those who don’t want to leave the building, there’s a fair-priced mini bar stocked with spirits and wine, or staff can deliver bottles directly to the room when an order is placed via the app or telephone.

My room was tidy, clean and tastefully decorated with darker accents and wooden cabinets, but I was far more interested in the technology than the decor.

When I’m away from home I try to unplug and put my mobile phone down for more than five minutes, but the technology is what makes this hotel special and brings a new level of convenience to holidays or business trips.
