Walking in groups does more than put a spring in your step – it cuts your risk of life-threatening disorders, say researchers.

Stroke, coronary heart disease, depression and even cancer recurrence can be staved off through regular outdoor walking in groups, they found.

Among the benefits are lower blood pressure, resting heart rate, blood cholesterol levels, body fat and Body Mass Index (BMI).

Researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA), who carried out a study, want doctors to recommend group walking as a regular tonic.

Sarah Hanson and Professor Andy Jones of UEA’s Norwich Medical School carried out a review of 42 studies that looked at 1,843 participants in 14 countries, including a total of 74,000 hours of group walking.

Sarah Hanson said ‘Our research suggests that by joining a group, people walk faster and further than they would normally walk.

‘It is one of the best and easiest ways to boost overall health. The benefits are wide ranging – and they go above and beyond making people more physically active.’

She said the psychological benefits and security found in group walking paid health dividends.

‘The merits of walking – including lowering the recurrence of some cancers – are well known, but these findings show that the dynamics and social cohesion of walking in groups may produce additional advantages.

‘People who walk in groups also tend to have a more positive attitude toward physical activity, a shared experience of wellness, and say they feel less lonely and isolated’ she added.

Britons are advised to do 150 minutes a week of moderate activity such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking.

But almost a third do less than 30 minutes exercise a week, and one in 10 doesn't manage to walk more than five minutes at a time over a month.

The new study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine (must credit), looked at walkers with obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, fibromyalgia, Parkinson’s disease, as well as healthy participants

The findings showed people who joined walking groups registered statistically significant falls in average blood pressure, resting heart rate, body fat, weight, and total cholesterol.

Walkers also experienced improvements in lung power, overall physical functioning, and general fitness, and they were less depressed than before they started walking regularly.

Evidence was less clear-cut for reductions in other risk factors for ill health, such as waist circumference, fasting blood glucose and blood fats.

Three-quarters of all participants stuck with the group, and there were few side effects, apart from a handful of falls on roots or wet ground, and minor injuries such as calf strain.

Sarah Hanson said people in groups get a sense of belonging, with some men and women enjoying the security.

She said ‘People told us all the organising was done for them, they simply had to turn up. It becomes an obligation, habit-forming, which helps them stick at it.

‘Some men said if they go for a walk in the woods on their own with no dog their motives might be questioned.’

She said ‘These findings may provide clinicians with evidence of a further effective option to recommend to those patients who would benefit from increasing the amount of moderate-intensity physical activity they do.’

The ‘Walking for Health’ scheme, run by the Ramblers and Macmillan Cancer Support, is England’s largest network of outdoor group walks, with 70,000 regular walkers, 10,000 volunteer walk leaders and approximately 3,000 short walks offered every week around the country.

Jackie Hayhoe, programme manager for Walking for Health, said ‘Walking really works. Every day we see the positive impact this simple activity has on the thousands of people who regularly take part in Walking for Health group walks.

‘We’re delighted to see further evidence to support what we see on the ground – that walking with others adds to the many health and well-being benefits regular walkers see.

“As the evidence mounts, we’d like to see more local authorities, clinicians and public health professionals supporting and recommending walking groups in their local areas.’
