British soldiers in Hellmand Province have handed a base over to Afghan forces as the native troops take on a greater role in the conflict.

In a demonstration of the increasing capability and confidence of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), the British Army has relinquished control of Patrol Base (PB) Ouellette to the Afghan National Civil Order Police (ANCOP). 

The base, which is situated on Route 611 in the district of Nahr-e Saraj, had been home to UK Armed Forces since July 2011.

The transfer is part of an ongoing base 
reduction programme which is expected to leave just four bases in 
central Helmand, alongside Camp Bastion, by the end of October.

The handover, which was marked by a ceremony held by Afghan officials, comes as British forces are longer needed to provide support to Afghan forces in Nahr-e Saraj 
District.

Security along Route 611 is now entirely conducted by the ANCOP who will keep the base as part of their force structure in the area.

The road is a crucial link between 
northern Helmand and the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah.  Security 
along the route is vital to the freedom and safety of locals, and is key to economic development in the area.

The base reductions are discussed closely with the local Afghan forces to ensure the best solution as part of the ANSF’s enduring presence in the area.

Brigadier Rupert Jones, Commander Task Force Helmand, said: 'The handover of Patrol Base Ouellette is another indicator of the progress of the Afghan security forces as a whole that we have seen across central Helmand this summer.

'This progress has enabled us to reduce our forward bases one by one.

'As we come to the closing stages of what is typically the fighting season it’s a good moment to reflect on the reality that the Afghan National Security Forces have done exceptionally well.

'They have very firmly have held the momentum in Helmand over the insurgent all the way through.'

Lieutenant Colonel Jon Swift, said: 'Over the last six months we have seen a lot of development in this part of Nahr-e Saraj district.

'Until recently, this was one of the most contested areas in central Helmand. The improvement in security is, in large part, thanks to the efforts of the ANCOP to reduce the threat to locals who use the road.

'It has been pleasing to see that each time the ANCOP have developed they have taken on more responsibility for security in the area and that has led us to this stage where we can hand the base over to the Afghans as they provide security now and into the future.'

Soldiers from 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (2 SCOTS) who make up the Police Mentoring and Advisory Group have assisted with training and advised their ANCOP counterparts at PB Ouellette throughout Operation Herrick 18, the most recent changeover of British forces.

Lieutenant Simon Wright, 2 SCOTS, said: 'Our mission was to advise, train and mentor the ANCOP and we have certainly achieved that. They’re a very tough bunch, particularly the commanders. They are not afraid to take on the insurgents.'

Second Lieutenant Zahir Khan, ANCOP Platoon Commander, said: 'We really appreciate that ISAF were here to provide security when we needed it. Now that they are leaving we will do our best to continue to provide the same security as ISAF forces did.

'Before this camp was built people felt threatened by the insurgency in the area but now they are safe.'

Major Steve Dallard, the officer commanding PB Ouellette, said: 'Challenges still remain for the ANSF in the area but the ANCOP here have proven themselves to be well-trained, well-resourced and well-led, and more than capable of maintaining security on Route 611.

'They have established lots of checkpoints along the Route and have a much better awareness of the local area and population than we have had.'
