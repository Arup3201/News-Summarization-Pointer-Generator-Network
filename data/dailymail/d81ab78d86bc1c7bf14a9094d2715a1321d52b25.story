President Barack Obama said Friday he would act 'fairly soon' on immigration if Congress doesn't enact reforms of its own.

Obama had said in June that he expected a list of policy proposals from his advisers 'before the end of summer' and he would 'adopt those recommendations without further delay.'

The White House has since backtracked from that timeline after getting grief from Democrats facing difficult reelection bids this fall. Executive action on immigration could lead to a trouncing at the ballot box, they say, and Obama should wait until after November to make an announcement.

President Barack Obama denied on Friday that he was getting cold feet about acting on immigration. Obama said he would roll out his own reforms 'fairly soon' if Congress didn't enact their own

Endangered Democrats worry that the Obama could motivate conservatives - who are already up in arms over the his decision two years ago to give illegal immigrants who came to the country as children amnesty - to come to the polls in droves.

Asked about the link between the lag in movement on the issue and the upcoming elections on Friday, Obama said the crises in Ukraine and Iraq had been dominating his time as of late.

'I have to tell you that this week I’ve been pretty busy, focused on Ukraine and focused on ISIL and focused on making sure that NATO is boosting its commitments, and following through on what’s necessary to meet 21st century challenges,' he said during a press conference in Wales after the conclusion of a North Atlantic Treaty Summit there.

Immigration activists and hardline Democrats have become increasingly suspicious that the president is dragging his feet on purpose, however.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest poured accelerant on progressives' concerns on Tuesday when he confirmed to reporters that Obama may not act on immigration reform in the next few weeks after all.

'There is the chance that it could be before the end of the summer,' he said. 'There is the chance that it could be after the summer.'

National Council of La Raza spokeswoman Janet Murguia said on Friday that 'the time for waiting has come and gone' and that the immigration reform advocates expect Obmaa to 'fulfill his promises.'

'The president, in March, when we asked him to take administrative action, asked us to wait, because there was still going to be a chance for some legislative action. And we waited then,' she told MSNBC’s Jose Diaz-Balart.

'And now there are some Senate Democrats who are asking us to wait again,' she said, according to The Daily Caller.

'You know, we’re done waiting. We’ve waited long enough. Every day that we wait, 1,100 lives are shattered as a result of deportation and separation.'

Murguia was referring to a report in Politico this week that Sens. Bill Nelson of Florida, Al Franken of Minnesota and Angus King of Maine, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats - want Obama to keep his power dry until after November.

All three men are are up for reelection this year.

Obama said he would be reviewing a list of recommendations from his advisers on the way home from his trip to Wales and promised that he would be 'making an announcement soon'

Illinois Rep. Luis Gutiérrez, who represents a heavily Democratic district and is assured to win his own election this fall, said on Wednesday that Obama should not allow politics to stand in the way of his principles.

In a conference call with immigration reform advocates,Gutiérrez said the president needs to act 'in a transparent manner, before the election.'

'We should not put partisan politics and political … considerations ahead of fairness, ahead of justice, and ahead of good public policy,' he said, per Politico.

'Democrats have to come to understand that you can’t pick and choose when [immigrants] are good for you.'

Earnest had denied on Tuesday that Obama was getting cold feet about taking action, but his assurances did little to calm progressives down.

'The president is determined to act,' Earnest said after indicating that Obama may wait to tackle the issue. 'That has not changed and it will not change.'

Obama recommitted to rolling out his own reforms on Friday in a statement of his own.

'In the absence of action by Congress, I’m going to do what I can do within the legal constraints of my office,' he said, 'because it’s the right thing to do for the country.'

Leadership in the House, where Obama's favored immigration bill hit a snag last year, indicated this week that they would not take up in the issue during the 12 days they'll be in Washington ahead of the election, making it clear that Obama needs to go it alone if he wants to see reforms any time soon.

The president said today that Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder had begun providing him proposals.

'My expectation is that fairly soon I’ll be considering what the next steps are,' he said.

Among the problems Obama said he was looking to address were the lack of resources on the border, the length of time illegal immigrants already in the U.S. have to wait for a court date and the absence of a pathway to citizenship for those illegals.

The president indicated that he would use the flight back from Wales to study those issues and promised that he would 'be making an announcement soon.'
