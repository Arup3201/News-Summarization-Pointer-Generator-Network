For four years, beginning when she was just 13 years old, Madison Reed lived her life in front of cameras - only she did know about because her neighbor had secretly planted recording devices in her room.

The Beaverton, Oregon, girl, who is now 18 years old, only found out about the outrageous violation of her privacy six months ago when he mother discovered a tiny camera stashed under a heap of papers in her bedroom.

On Tuesday, 48-year-old-old Bradley McCollum, a one-time friend of the Reed family, pleaded guilty in Washington County circuit court to charges of burglary and invasion of personal privacy - both misdemeanors.

As part of a plea deal, he is expected to be sentenced March 10 to two years in prison - a decision the victim and her parents have decried as a 'slap on the wrist.'

Prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to prove he was guilty of a sex crime, which means that upon his release McCollum will not be required to register as a sex offender.

Speaking to KGW this week, Madison and her parents said McCollum is getting off too easy considering the heinousness of the crime, and all because under state law recording a minor with a hidden camera is not a felony.

‘It doesn't make sense at all because I don't know why it's not child pornography,’ Madison said. ‘I was underage at the time and the intent of what he did was so obvious.

A police investigation has revealed that in 2010, Bradley McCollum, a close friend and neighbor of the Reeds, planted a camera at his beach house to spy on Madison whenever the family visited him.

Last July, McCollum slipped a second recording device into Madison's bedroom, taping hours of footage showing the teenage girl naked and in various state of undress.

About two weeks later, Madison's father, Clark Reed, became alarmed when he spotted his friend near his daughter's room, and a short time later his wife came upon a camera smaller than a smartphone hidden under some papers on a dresser.

Madison, who is now 18, says it has been difficult for her to get over the trauma, and to this day she cannot shake off the feeling that she is being watched.

'I don't like to think about it, but I think about it all the time. Like all day,' Miss Reed told the station, adding that in order to put her mind at ease her parents had taped the blinds in her room to the wall.

The Reed family are now pushing for state lawmakers to pass legislation that would upgrade hidden camera crimes to sexual offenses with stiffer penalties. 

Former Oregon state Representative Denyc Boles, a Republican from Salem, has proposed a bill that would make the charge of invasion of personal privacy an automatic felony if the victim is under 18 years and carry a maximum penalty of five years and prison.

Boles' bill would also require people convicted of felony invasion of personal privacy to register as sex offenders if they have a prior sex crime conviction.
