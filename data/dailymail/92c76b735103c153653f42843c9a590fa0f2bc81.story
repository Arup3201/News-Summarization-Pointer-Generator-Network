An expedition to a remote part of northern Australia has uncovered three new vertebrate species isolated for millions of years, with scientists today calling the area a ‘lost world’.

Conrad Hoskin from James Cook University and a National Geographic film crew were dropped by helicopter onto the rugged Cape Melville mountain range on the Cape York Peninsula earlier this year and were amazed at what they found.

It included a bizarre looking leaf-tail gecko, a gold-coloured skink (a type of lizard) and a brown-spotted, yellow boulder-dwelling frog, none of them ever seen before.

Hoskin, a tropical biologist from the Queensland-based university, said: ‘The top of Cape Melville is a lost world. 

‘Finding these new species up there is the discovery of a lifetime. I'm still amazed and buzzing from it.

‘Finding three new, obviously distinct vertebrates would be surprising enough in somewhere poorly explored like New Guinea, let alone in Australia, a country we think we've explored pretty well.’

The virtually impassable mountain 
range is home to millions of black granite boulders the size of cars and
 houses piled hundreds of metres high, eroded in places after being 
thrust up through the earth millions of years ago.

A 'lost world': Hoskin said it was 'the discovery of a lifetime' in the area which is largely unexplored because of a virtually impassable mountain range. Pictured is the gold-coloured skink

While
 surveys had previously been conducted in the boulder-fields around the 
base of Cape Melville, a plateau of boulder-strewn rainforest on top, 
identified by satellite imagery, had remained largely unexplored, 
fortressed by massive boulder walls.

Within days of arriving, the team had discovered the three new species as well as a host of other interesting finds that Hoskins said may also be new to science.

The highlight was the leaf-tailed 
gecko, a ‘primitive-looking’ 7.9 inch-long creature that is an ancient 
relic from a time when rainforest was more widespread in Australia. 

The
 Cape Melville Leaf-tailed Gecko, has huge eyes and a long, slender 
body, is highly distinct from its relatives and has been named 
Saltuarius eximius. Hoskin said the findings detailed in the latest 
edition of the international journal Zootaxa.

He said: ‘The second I saw the gecko I knew it was a new species. Everything about it was obviously distinct.’

Back for more: The National Geographic film crew intend to return to the area to search for more new species including snails, spiders and even small mammals

Highly camouflaged, the geckos sit motionless, head-down, waiting to ambush passing insects and spiders.

The Cape Melville Shade Skink is also
 restricted to moist rocky rainforest on the plateau and is highly 
distinct from its relatives, which are found in rainforests to the 
south.

Also discovered was a
 small boulder-dwelling frog, the Blotched Boulder-frog, which during 
the dry season lives deep in the labyrinth of the boulder-field where 
conditions are cool and moist, allowing female frogs to lay their eggs 
in wet cracks in the rocks.

In the absence of water, the tadpole develops within the egg and a fully formed frog hatches out.

Once the summer wet season begins the frogs emerge on the surface of the rocks to feed and breed in the rain.

Tim Laman, a National Geographic photographer and Harvard University researcher who joined Hoskin on the expedition, said he was stunned to know such undiscovered places remained.

He said: ‘What's really exciting about this expedition is that in a place like Australia, which people think is fairly well explored, there are still places like Cape Melville where there are all these species to discover.

‘There's still a big world out there to explore.’

According to National Geographic, the team plans to return to Cape Melville within months to search for more new species, including snails, spiders, and perhaps even small mammals.

Hoskin said: ‘All the animals from Cape Melville are incredible just for their ability to persist for millions of years in the same area and not go extinct. It's just mind-blowing.’
