Tony Abbott took a break amid the mounting pressure on his leadership to take a ride with Tour de France winner Cadel Evans, as three potential candidates emerged to take over as leader of the Government.

The Prime Minister's leadership has been the subject of increasing speculation following a series of unpopular decisions capped by the controversy over his decision to knight  Prince Phillip.

Amid backbencher disquiet Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison and former Howard government cabinet minister Mal Brough have emerged as potential candidates to take over as leader of the Liberal party.

The latest sign of pressure on Mr Abbott is an expected announcement on Monday watering down his signature policy, the controversial Paid Parental Leave scheme, which has received significant criticism for being to expensive.

Mr Abbott played down speculations of turmoil within the Liberal party on Saturday,  as he participated in the People's Ride as part of the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race.

After handing out a knighthood to Prince Phillip last week, Mr Abbott gave himself a title- MAMIL, a middle-aged man in lycra, maintaining he was still in touch with ordinary Australians.

'I'll be mixing with hundreds if not thousands of people,' the Prime Minister said on Friday.

'I'm sure along the way I'll be stopping at a cafe along with the other MAMILs, as I believe we're described,' he said.

'I am regularly in contact with the Australian public and sometimes it is good news they give me, sometimes it is not good news that they give me.'

His comments come as reports that Mal Brough has been approached to pave the way for Liberal party leadership contenders, rumours which Mr Brough did not deny.

A challenge by Mr Brough is seen by some within the Liberal Party as an effective way to highlight dissatisfaction with Mr Abbott and push leadership change to the front of business. 

'Clearly people are talking to each other because we are all interested in doing what's best for the nation,' Mr Brough told Fairfax Media.

An unnamed MP said that while neither Ms Bishop, Mr Turnbull, or Mr Morrison had put their names forward, 'if one of them put their hand up things would happen very quickly'.

Mr Abbott's speech to the National Press Club on Monday will aim to placate the party's waves, as the Prime Minister looks to announce the changes to the Paid Parental Leave scheme.

'My job regardless is to get on with delivering for the people of Australia a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia,' he said.

Under Mr Abbott's original which would have paid 26 weeks of full wage to mothers, as opposed to the current scheme, Introduced by Labor, which pays mothers 18 weeks of the minimum wage.

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry boss Kate Carnell believes the scheme should be postponed completely until the budget is back under control. 

Labor spokeswoman for families and payments Jenny Macklin accused Mr Abbott of deceiving Australian families over the scheme.

'If he can't deliver his signature policy, what can he deliver?' she said.

However, several senior government figures have publicly thrown their support behind the prime minister.

Treasurer Joe Hockey issued a warning to his colleagues, reminding them not to replicate the leadership troubles of the former-Labor government.

'Everyone's entitled to a view but I would just say to people: we do not want to become a carbon copy of a bad Labor government, the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government,' Mr Hockey said.
