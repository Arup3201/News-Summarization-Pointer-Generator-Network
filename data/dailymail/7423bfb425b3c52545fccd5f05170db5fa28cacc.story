Prolific: Danny York owned up to 50 break-ins around Colchester, stealing £25,000 of property

A prolific burglar had a crisis of conscience in prison - and owned up to 50 break-ins.

Danny York, 27, was given an extra jail terms of two years and five months after coming clean to officers about a seven year crime spree in Colchester, Essex.

Police admitted they had no evidence linking him to the crimes, and said they would have remained unsolved without his confession.

York stole £25,000 of property, mostly from garages, to fund his drug habit.

He decided to come clean while he was already serving a nine-month sentence for three burglaries, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.

He asked to see police and the result was officers solved another 48 break-ins plus two house burglaries and the theft of two expensive bikes from a garage.

Judge Patrick O’Brien said: 'You seem to have taken a hard look at yourself and got rid of your drug habit and decided to wipe the slate clean.'

The judge jailed him for a total of two years five months after he admitted two burglaries, a theft and asked for another 48 matters to be considered.

Mark Lakin, prosecuting, told the court York, of no fixed address, was in jail when he decided to tell police what he had been doing.

One burglary was traced back to May 2005 with the others carried out in Colchester over the next seven years, Mr Lakin said.

Televisions, jewellery, laptops, phones and bikes were among the items taken to pay for his drugs, the court heard. Clare Ashcroft, mitigating, said: 'He wants to wipe the slate clean and make a fresh start.

'He’s now drug free and is making good use of his time in prison.'

York’s sister Clare York, 23, said he is no longer part of the family but hopes he would stay true to his word to honour his mum, Tina York, who died in October.

She said: “I hope one day he’ll sort himself and his life out for the sake of our mum who passed away in October.

Confession: York was sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court and later admitted a seven-year crime spree while in prison

'But he has a long way to go before he is forgiven for the trouble he’s caused.'

Police have admitted York’s crimes would have gone unsolved had it not been for his confession.

Detective Constable Jim Finnigan said: 'I can confirm that if York had not made the decision to voluntarily engage with the police and take this bold step, these offences would have remained unsolved. We knew nothing, we had no evidence.'

Detective Constable Finnigan said the confession would also provide reassurance to his victims, many of which were homeowners.

He said: 'We are now going to be able to go back to these victims and we can offer them some reassurance that it wasn’t personal, they weren’t targeted, they weren’t watched - the majority of York’s offences were opportunist. The judge picked up on that.'

He added: 'York was formerly a drug user. He now wishes to do all that he can to reassure that upon his release, he does so in the knowledge that he has been brought to justice for every crime he has ever committed and look forward to a crime-free life.

'He is also keen to demonstrate to his family this part of his life is completely behind him and is doing all he can to re-build their trust.'
