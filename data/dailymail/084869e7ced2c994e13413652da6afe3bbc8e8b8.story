Fanatic fiasco: Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed gave police the slip by entering a London mosque in his regular clothes - then leaving disguised in a burka

A new tagging fiasco has plunged the monitoring of Britain’s most dangerous terror suspects into chaos.

Three men who were accused of tampering with their supposedly state-of-the-art monitoring equipment walked free from court after their lawyers successfully argued the tags were ‘faulty’.

One of the men – Al Qaeda-trained fanatic Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed – was last night the subject of an international manhunt after going on the run only a few hours after the case collapsed.

After being freed, the 27-year-old jihadist gave police the slip by entering a London mosque in his regular clothes – then leaving disguised in a burka.

Lawyers for the Somali-born British citizen had claimed he had damaged his electronic tag when kneeling down to pray.

The other two men involved in the tagging case are a fanatic linked to the foiled 2006 airline liquid bomb plot and an Iranian explosives expert.

The shocking revelations have led to a review of the tagging regime. Last night there were also demands from MPs for the burka to be banned.

Tory MP Philip Hollobone said the burka had proved the ‘most complete disguise for a Muslim terrorist suspect’.

On a day of drama at Westminster, Home Secretary Theresa May appeared before MPs to explain what had gone so badly wrong with the monitoring of Mohamed.

He is linked to the Al-Shabaab terror group and is accused of plotting attacks against Western interests in east Africa.

Mohamed was under a terrorism prevention and investigation measures order, or T-Pim, to restrict his movements.

Along with eight other men who are the subject of a T-Pim, the conditions included wearing a new GPS electronic tag, which allow their every step to be tracked on a computer screen.

Mohamed, along with two other terror suspects, was accused of tampering with his tag – a crime which potentially carries a five-year jail term.

But last week the case against all three men collapsed when the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence.

Defence lawyers say that the cases had to be dropped because the design of the new tags is flawed.

They say that the tags do not appear to have been stress-tested to cope with a devout Muslim who prostrates himself in prayer five times a day.

Faulty: Mohamed, along with two other terror 
suspects, was accused of tampering with his tag. But their lawyers 
successfully argued the devices were damaged by the stress of the 
five-times-a-day Muslim prayers

It was in the immediate aftermath of 
the verdict in his case on Friday that Mohamed entered the An-Noor 
Masjid Mosque and Community Centre in Acton, West London, at 10am.

He was last seen inside the mosque at 3.15pm before leaving disguised in a burka.

Somali-born Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, has been linked to the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab – the extremists behind the Kenyan mall massacre – and is accused of plotting attacks on Western interests in east Africa.

It is understood he took part in terrorist training in 2008 and is believed to have helped various individuals travel from the UK to Somalia to allow them to engage in terrorism-related activity.

Mohamed, who is 5ft 8in and of medium build, is also suspected of helping to plan attacks in Somalia and overseas, including an attack intended for the Juba Hotel in Mogadishu in 2010.

He is thought to be a member of a UK-based network which had access to money, false passports and documentation, as well as equipment, and is understood to have procured funds and weapons for terrorism uses for the network.

It emerged last night that he repeatedly purchased phone cards used to call contacts overseas in the weeks before he fled.

He bought the international Lycamobile cards from a newsagent close to the An-Noor Masjid Mosque and Community Centre in West London – the same mosque from which he made his escape dressed in a burka last Friday.

The purchase of the phone cards will fuel suspicions he had long been plotting to escape abroad, possibly back to his Al-Shabaab associates in Somalia.

It was also revealed last night that the son of extradited hate preacher Abu Hamza is viewed as a local ‘celebrity’ at the mosque.

Uthman Mustafa Kamal was said to have built up a following at the mosque. He has also prayed for holy war in a video uploaded to the mosque’s YouTube site.

The case immediately led to an on-going international manhunt. Security officials fear he may already be overseas.

In the Commons, Shadow Home Secretary 
Yvette Cooper demanded to know the role the tagging fiasco had played, 
asking: ‘Why did the Government drop the case? Were the tags faulty?’

She
also attacked the T-Pims which the Coalition introduced as an 
alternative to Labour’s control orders. Mohamed is the second man to 
flee while under a T-Pim in only ten months.

Unlike
control orders, it is no longer possible for the police and security 
services to force a terror suspect to relocate to another part of the 
country and so break up their support network.

Mohamed,
who had originally been subject of a control order and moved out of 
London, was allowed to move back when T-Pims came into force in January 
2012.

Miss Cooper said: ‘This Home Secretary has made it easier for terror suspects to disappear and that is irresponsible.’

Mrs May denied T-Pims had put the public at risk and said Mohamed’s tag was thought to have be working correctly when he absconded.

Officials were aware he may have gone on the run on Friday afternoon and began urgent work to track him. His identity was made public on Sunday night.

The Ministry of Justice said it was investigating whether ‘a very small number of GPS tags currently in use ... may be overly sensitive to tamper alerts’.

█ The Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into the Government’s multi-million-pound contracts with security firms G4S and Serco for tagging criminals.

An audit suggested that the companies had been charging for tagging criminals who were either dead, in jail or never tagged in the first place.

In some cases bills continued to be paid for months or years after tags were taken off, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told MPs.

Both G4S and Serco said they would ‘co-operate fully’ with the investigation.

Fiasco: Nick Clegg's insisting control orders must be significantly watered down may have paved the way for Mohamed's escape from custody

It was Theresa May who was dragged to the Commons yesterday to explain how another terrorism suspect had been allowed to slip through the net.

But this is a fiasco covered in the fingerprints of Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister.

When the Coalition was formed in 2010, both sides committed to a review of Labour’s controversial control order regime, which allowed fanatics to be placed under virtual house arrest.

They could be made to stay indoors for up to 16 hours a day, banned from having computers and mobile phones and – crucially – forced to relocate to another part of the UK.

Months of wrangling between the Tories and Lib Dems followed, with Mr Clegg insisting control orders must be significantly watered down.

Mrs May fought hard on behalf of the security services, but, in order to keep the overnight curfew element of the control orders (albeit reduced to ten hours), she was forced to sacrifice the power of relocation.

Labour now insists she is paying a heavy price for this compromise – which stripped MI5 of a powerful tool that could be used to break up terrorist support networks.

As we report today, Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed had previously been the subject of a relocation order when he was subject to a control order. But, under the T-Pim regime insisted upon by Mr Clegg, he was free to move back to London in early 2012.

Would he really have been able to plot his escape – or get away so easily – had he been living in a smaller town or city, without having his associates and support network close by? 

What is certain is that he is not the first terror suspect to vanish after having his relocation order quashed.

Ibrahim Magag – an associate of Mohamed, who attended training camps in Somalia – had been sent from London to live in the west of England under the terms of his control order.

Back in the capital, he gave the police the slip by jumping into the back of a black cab in London’s Triton Street on Boxing Day 2012 and hasn’t been seen since. The fanatic is now understood to be abroad.

Heavy price: But it was Home Secretary Theresa May who had to answer to the Commons about it yesterday

Mrs May says the scrapping of the relocation power should not be blamed, pointing out that under Labour’s control orders there were seven absconds and six of the suspects were never apprehended.

Currently there are nine terror suspects, including Mohamed, subject to a T-Pim, which are used against those who cannot be prosecuted in court because there is insufficient admissible evidence.

Normally, this is because handing the evidence to suspects would expose secret intelligence gathering techniques or put agents’ lives at risk.
