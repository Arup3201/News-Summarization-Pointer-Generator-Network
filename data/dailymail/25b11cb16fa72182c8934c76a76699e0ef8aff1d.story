Mr Justice Peter Jackson (pictured) said 'necessary restraint' could take place for the woman's operation

A judge today ruled that surgeons could perform a hysterectomy on a mentally ill woman who is detained at a specialist hospital after concluding that she is unable to make decisions about her treatment.

Mr Justice Peter Jackson said ‘necessary restraint’ could take place for the operation, which he said was in the 36-year-old woman’s best interests after analysing evidence at a hearing in London.

Sitting in the Court of Protection - which handles cases involving sick and vulnerable people - the judge ruled that the woman, who is detained under the terms of mental health legislation, was not capable of making decisions about her treatment.

His ruling came after a specialist told him the woman needed treatment due to her medical problems getting worse and affecting her mental health.

Mr Justice Peter Jackson said: ‘This is not in any sense an operation being carried out on a protesting patient with the use of heavy restraint.

‘This is an operation that in my view (she) will be relieved to have. The level of security that is going to be needed is no more than is going to be necessary to reassure her.’

He had heard legal argument from lawyers representing health authority officials and the woman, who all agreed the woman should have a hysterectomy.

The judge was told that the main disadvantage would be that the woman would lose her ability to bear children and he said it was a major consideration.

But he said that disadvantage was outweighed by her need for treatment.

He was told that she was likely to be 
detained for some years and said that because of the ‘extremely 
difficult’ circumstances she was in, her inability to become pregnant 
would not be a ‘significant detriment’ to her.

The methods which might be needed to restrain the woman were not discussed at today’s hearing.

The Court of Protection is part of the High Court and analyses issues relating to sick and vulnerable people

Mr Justice Peter Jackson said she had already visited a hospital for an assessment and said staff from the unit where she was detained had accompanied her on the visit, which had gone ‘pretty smoothly’.

He said neither the woman, her location, nor any hospital where she was treated, could be identified.

The Court of Protection makes decisions and appoints deputies to act on behalf of individuals who are sick and vulnerable and unable to make informed decisions about their personal health, finance or welfare.
