Featuring seven bedrooms, five bathrooms and hardwood floors, this Tudor-style family home could be expected to cost a packet.

But the property in Detroit is in fact listed for just $1,000 as the city expands its online auction of homes in its efforts to combat the area's blight.

Mayor Mike Duggan and the Detroit Land Bank Authority announced the auction website Building Detroit last month, which was designed to get homes into the hands of people who will quickly fix them.

This seven bedroom Tudor-style property in Detroit is listed at just $1,000 as the city expands its online auction of homes in its efforts to combat blight

Among those currently listed for auction on the site is a stunning six bedroom 1914 Georgian Revival property, complete with leaded glass, a tile fireplace, elegant wainscoting and original woodwork

This five bedroom brick home features five bathrooms and a three-car garage. The home needs new plumbing along with new front porch steps, electrics and kitchen

The property also needs cosmetic upgrades to the floor and paint for the walls, according to the Building Detroit website

The site launched with 15 homes up for auction - but the scheme has now been expanded to include two more neighbourhoods, featuring some impressive properties.

A total of 13 listings in Boston Edison, on Detroit's west side, have been added to the website, along with 10 houses in the eastside Osborn area, according to WILX 10.

Five houses were bought in the auction's first week, most commanding at least $30,000 after being listed for $1,000.

Among those currently listed for auction on the site is a 1929 East English Village brick home, which has three bedrooms.

Elsewhere, a stunning six bedroom 1914 Georgian Revival property is available, complete with leaded glass, a tile fireplace, elegant wainscoting and original woodwork.

As with many of the properties on the site, the home does require some repair work.

This brick colonial, which features six bedrooms and three bathrooms, sits on a generous lot and has several fireplaces

Upgrades to the property's electrical system, plumbing and interior waterproofing is recommended however

This three-storey 1920 home features ornate woodwork and historic masonry - although the property does require a number of repairs and updates

This 1881 historical home, which has been coverted into a two-family property, needs some windows and a few doors, but offers four bedrooms and two bathrooms

Detroit has been working for years to deal with vacant and dangerous buildings, often by demolishing them.

Last month, Duggan announced a program for revitalizing neighborhoods by rebuilding and refurbishing homes.

Following the auction website's launch last month, officials said owners of uninhabited and dilapidated homes will be put on notice that their homes will be seized through legal action unless they begin work to fix them.

Any homes that are salvageable will be auctioned.

'This is a historic change in Detroit’s strategy in fighting blight,' Duggan said in April.

This three bedroom brick colonial features a natural fireplace, formal dining room and garage - there are a number of areas however which need attention, including its roof and gutters

Mayor Mike Duggan and the Detroit Land Bank Authority announced the auction website Building Detroit last month which was designed to get homes into the hands of people who will quickly fix them

'We are getting away from this mindless process of demolishing everything that’s vacant. What’s different is we are attacking the entire neighborhood at once.'

The city was planning 'an extensive marketing campaign' to drum up interest in the auction.

Duggan's program is modeled after a similar project he ran as the Wayne County prosecutor from 2001 to 2003, the Detroit News reported.

That initiative saw 1,000 homes fixed up.
