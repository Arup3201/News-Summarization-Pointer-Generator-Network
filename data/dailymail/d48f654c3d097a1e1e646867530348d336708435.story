Jose Mourinho teams have been accused of parking the bus when faced with a tough away fixture.

The same cannot be said, however, of Chelsea's driver, who failed to park the team bus while entering the Parc des Princes, ahead of the Blues' round of 16 Champions League tie with PSG.

Failing to navigate a tight turn into the stadium's underground car park, the clumsy driver managed to get the bus wedged into the entrance, smashing a rear window in the process.

No one was hurt during the accident.

With the bus rendered immobile and at a slant, Mourinho and his players were forced to make the last few yards into the changing rooms on foot. 

Chelsea are facing PSG for the second consecutive season, having beaten the French champions in last year's quarter-finals.

Mourinho has previously lifted the Champions League trophy with Porto and Inter Milan, though success on the continent with Chelsea has eluded him thus far.
