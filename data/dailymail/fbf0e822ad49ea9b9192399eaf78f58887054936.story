Ivan Craddock, who sexually abused teenage girls in the 1970s and 80s, has been jailed for 13 years at Snaresbrook Crown Court

A taxi driver who raped a schoolgirl after spiking her carton of Ribena was jailed for 13 years today.

Ivan Craddock, 63, drugged his 12-year-old victim and subjected her to a campaign of sexual abuse during the 1970s.

He then persuaded the schoolgirl not to go to police by bribing her with cash before blackmailing her and threatening to shame her in front of her family.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard Craddock also targeted a 13-year-old and indecently assaulted a third girl at a bedsit in 1988.

He tried to claim his victims, who came forward to police in February 2012, were 'liars' during his trial, but a jury found him guilty of three counts of indecent assault, two of rape and a single count of administering a noxious substance with intent.

Sentencing Craddock today, Judge Simon Wilkinson said the cab driver had 'destroyed' the childhood of one of the victims and shown no remorse.

He told the court: 'The first victim was as young as 12 when you first indecently assaulted her.She was as young as 13 when you first raped her. Your sexual misconduct towards her continued until she was nearly 17.

'You destroyed the later part of her childhood and you have clouded her existence to this present day.

'The second victim was indecently assaulted by you in 1988 - in order to do so you administered to her a noxious substance'.

Some of Craddock's victims, who are now middle-aged women, sobbed in the public gallery during his sentencing, but he showed no emotion as he was jailed for a total of 13 years.

The court heard Craddock abused one of his victims when she was aged 12 after offering to take her to Hornchurch, east London, where he bought her a carton of Ribena, which he spiked.

After taking a few gulps of the drugged drink she later woke up to find herself in the car with her clothes undone, the court heard.

Prosecutor Mark Williams

Prosecutor Mark Williams said: 'At least twice a week... the same thing would happen - she would have a drink and wake up having been interfered with'.

In November 1977, the girl was raped by Craddock as she slept after being given yet another noxious drink.

He then blackmailed the teenager by saying he would tell her family what she had done until, aged 17, she finally plucked up the courage to confront him about his abuse.

Mr Williams added: 'He groomed one of his victims by earning her trust by treating her as an adult but went on to drug her and have sex with her until she was old enough to put a stop to it.'

After Craddock's victims came forward, he was arrested and interviewed in June 2012 and denied the claims to officers.

'Through your evidence those victims were called liars by you', Judge Wilkinson added.

'It increased their trauma. You have shown no remorse. These victims were extremely vulnerable and there is evidence they have suffered severe psychological harm'.

Craddock, of Tamworth, Staffordshire, was found guilty of three counts of indecent assault, two of rape and a single count of administering a noxious substance with intent.
