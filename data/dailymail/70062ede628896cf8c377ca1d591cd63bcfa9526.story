Killed: Jason Richard Stevens, 39, of Scotland, died on the way to hospital after being shot several times

A British translator has been killed after trying to negotiate with a gunman during a robbery at a bar in Brazil.

The victim - named locally as Jason Richard Stevens, 39, from Scotland - died on the way to hospital after being shot several times as he played a snooker-style game in Sao Paulo.

He had just celebrated his 39th birthday a few days earlier. 

Police said two men burst into the bar in the upmarket neighbourhood of Interlagos in the south of the city around 11pm on Wednesday.

The gunman is said to have stood by the doorway and acted as a lookout while his accomplice went round the bar collecting up customers' personal belongings. The victim was shot as he tried to talk to the gunman.

One report said he was trying to calm him down after he started getting agitated when he saw some customers refuse to hand over belongings and try to overpower his accomplice.

He was shot several times in the stomach, leg and arms. Witnesses have told police the two gunmen fled in a black Ford Fiesta driven by a getaway driver.

Police have since revealed that the robbers got away with less than £200, police said.

Mr Stevens is understood to have lived in Brazil with parents Vicky and Richard and siblings Nina and Mark since he was a child.

He attended St Paul's, the main school in São Paulo for British expats before studying tourism at a local university. He then worked as a freelance translator with his own company, JRS Consultancy.

He is believed to have once had a French-Brazilian wife and was the father to a teenage daughter who friends say he described as the love of his life.

His friend Melina Revuelta said: 'I'm deeply sad and overwhelmed by his passing. 

'We've worked together several times and I'll never forget his genuine smile and the way he cheered up everybody at every event. 

'He used to sing  for the girls serving coffee in high-profile events in São Paulo, it was very cool.'

Another, Michael Gannan, said: 'Jason was a guy who touched people's lives in many meaningful ways. He was caring and always watching over everyone making sure we were comfortable. 

'He was a loving friend, a caring son and father. It's a huge loss.'

Monica Costa Almeida said: 'He was a fine guy, literally adored by everyone.' 

According to friends, he was a scout as a child and regularly enjoyed trips back to the UK. As an 'Old Paulean', he remained close to his old school in São Paulo. 

Murder squad detectives are probing the killing and were still hunting the killers last night.

Bar owner Fumihiro Yoshima said he believed the gunman may have panicked because he felt threatened by 6ft, 2in tall Mr Stevens, who also worked as a language consultant.

He said: ‘I think the robber shot him because he felt scared at how tall and strong he was.’

The dead man was playing sinuca, a type of Brazilian snooker, when the gunmen struck.

In an updated statement, the state security ministry of São Paulo said the case was being investigated by its homicide unit but no suspects had yet been arrested.

The spokesman said: 'The interpreter Jason Richard Stevens, 39, died during a robbery in a bar around 11pm on Wednesday, October 22, on Rua João Sobrinho in the south zone of São Paulo.

'The victim was in a bar when two men, one of them armed, announced a robbery. One of the suspects stayed at the door while the other collected the belongings of customers. 

'Jason talked to the armed man, and then walked in his direction but didn’t behave threateningly. The criminal shot him and the two robbers escaped. 

'They ran to the next street where the third suspect was waiting in a black Ford Fiesta.

'Jason was taken to hospital but was dead when he arrived. Experts were called and the case was registered with police.'

There is not believed to have been CCTV in the humble street bar in the south zone of São Paulo where the robbery happened.

Deaths during robberies are common in Brazil. According to the figures for 2012, the latest year available, there were 4,836 murders in São Paulo state alone.
