A couple who got divorced after 21 years of marriage are celebrating their first wedding anniversary - for the second time.

Tomorrow is a year since Neville and Barbara Pearce were married again after 35 years apart.

Barbara, 79, and Neville, 81, met in 1953, and were married three years later, but then divorced in 1977.

But after the death of Neville's second wife, who was also called Barbara, in 2012, the pair found love again. 

Neville and Barbara Pearce remarried after 35 years apart. Pictured left, their first wedding day in 1956 and right, their second wedding in December last year

They first met at a dance hall when Barbara was 18 and they enjoyed courting at the local cinema.

In 1954, Neville fractured his spine whilst working on a roof as a painter and decorator and couldn't work for three years.

Barbara walked with him up and down different streets to get him fit again.

They first got married at St Mary's Church, Barnsley on July 7, 1956, and had two children, David and Susan.

But work and family pressures drove them apart. 

'We were young and didn't put enough into it. It wasn't acrimonious, or we wouldn't be married today, there was no reason not to be friends,' said Neville.

'You only get out what you put in, but it's all water under the bridge.'

 The pair rekindled their relationship after the death of Neville's second wife, also called Barbara, in 2012

After his second wife died, Neville asked Barbara out for a meal and they rekindled their relationship. 

They spent more time together after Barbara broke her hip and enjoyed a holiday in Scotland before Neville got down on one knee and popped the question for a second time.

Barbara said: 'I didn't say yes straight away, I said I had to think about it. But I thought it was right. We have wasted time not being together.'

'I don't think we've ever stopped loving each other. Our family told us to get on with it, they are really pleased for us,' added Neville.

The couple, who live in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, married for the second time at nearby St Thomas' Church in Gawber.

And Barbara said the time apart has made for a better marriage.

Barbara says they get along better now and Neville adds: 'I don't think we ever stopped loving each other'

She said: 'It's more simple now. We've realised as we've both got older that we would do things differently.

'We get along and don't argue. There are not the same strains as before.'

Recalling her second wedding day, she added: 'It was a really lovely day. I'd not seen much of Neville's family because they live away. 

'But his sister stood up at the reception and said she had got her family back.' 

After their nuptials and a reception, they spent Christmas in Northumberland with their family. 

The couple are now looking forward to celebrating the first wedding anniversary a second time around with a bottle of beer and a pork pie.
