It's the moment the nation has been waiting for. The $600 record-breaking Powerball draw was made in Tallahassee, Florida, at 10:59 EDT on Saturday.

The odds of winning were put at one in 175.2 million, and the winning numbers were 10-13-14-22-52 and a Powerball of 11.

It is not yet known if the jackpot has been won.

The odds of someone winning tonight's $600 million jackpot are high as nearly all the possible number combinations have been bought.

Lottery officials estimate that about 80 per cent of possible combinations have been purchased, which makes a last-minute ticket purchase an enticing proposition.

'This would be the roll to get in on,' Iowa Lottery's chief executive Terry Rich said hours before the draw. 'Of course there's no guarantee, and that's the randomness of it, and the fun of it.'

With the promise of the largest draw in the game's history, lines of people have been forming in all of the 43 states and in Washington DC and U.S. Virgin Islands, for their chance to strike it lucky.

At a mini market in Los Angeles's Chinatown, employees had to create two lines - one for Powerball customers and one for everybody else.  

'We've had two winners over $10 million here over the years, so people in the neighborhood think this is the lucky store,' Gordon Chan said as he replenished a stack of lottery tickets on a counter.

At a store in Columbia, South Carolina, shop workers were so busy selling tickets that they had not had time to update the sign with the current jackpot figure.

Ticket buyers were keeping their 
strategies for winning close to their chest. Armous Peterson was 
reluctant to share his system for playing the Powerball, but the 
56-year-old said: 'Somebody is going to win.' 

The jackpot is the 's second largest 
in the world - just behind a $656 million Mega Millions jackpot in March
2012. 

While the prospect of winning appeals to many, some were concerned over how they would handle such a momentous win.

Charles Hill, of Dallas, said: 'I'd run and hide. I wouldn't want none of my kinfolks to find me.'

At a newstand in Manhattan's Penn 
Station Seema Sharma was rushed off her feet selling tickets, but she 
still found time to buy $80 worth of tickets for herself.

'I work very hard - too hard - and I want to get the money so I can finally relax,' she said. 

Clyde Barrow, a public policy 
professor at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, who specializes 
in the gaming industry, said a key factor behind the ticket-buying 
frenzy was the size of the jackpot and the easy investment.

'Even though the odds are very low, the investment is very small,' he said. '$2 gets you a chance.'

As the size of the jackpot 
dramatically grew during the week, so too did the clamor for tickets. 
Since Wednesday's draw it grew by $236 million.

The last jackpot was won on March 30, so it's been growing for about six weeks. 

The numbers sum up the frenzy that has taken over the Golden State since it joined the madness over Powerball.

California has sold $83 million worth of Powerball tickets since it started selling tickets in April.

Since
then, the most populous state has accounted for 11 per cent of the 
game's sales, fueling such fast-growing mega-jackpots like the latest 
one that has the potential to be a record-breaker.

The state expects to generate well 
above the originally estimated $50 million for public education, 
California lottery director Robert O'Neill told The Associated Press.

‘One thing California has brought Powerball is sunshine and good fortune,’ he said. "It has surprised us. We're very happy."

Californians have Nevadans to thank for some of that good fortune.

California's
biggest ticket-seller is the Primm Valley Lotto Store, which straddles 
the state line in tiny Nipton, a 19th century mining and ranching town 
on the edge of the Mojave desert whose booming lottery sales have put it
on the map in modern times.

Roxie Handley figured all 80 of its residents would have a ticket in hand by Saturday. That's if they can find the time.

‘Here
in Nipton, it's crazy,’ said Ms Handley, 59, who manages the Nipton 
Trading Post, which also sells Powerball tickets. ‘We're stocking up on 
everything. Last night, I heard some people had to wait nine hours in 
line.’

The town is about 35 miles from Las Vegas on the main interstate from the Los Angeles area.

Residents of the nation's No. 1 
gambling state do not have access to the lottery. The Nevada state 
constitution contains a prohibition on lotteries, which are seen as 
competition to the casino industry.

Norma
Wagoner was among the Nevadans trying their luck. She and a group of 
friends pooled their money to buy 20 tickets and sent one over the state
border to endure the long lines.

‘Everybody has dreams,’ she said. ‘All it takes is one ticket.’

Officials
expect the jackpot to keep growing before Saturday's drawing that could
break Powerball's November 2012 record of $587.5 million.

Lottery officials expect jackpots to continue growing faster and bigger, thanks in part to a game redesign in January 2012 that increased the odds of winning some kind of prize of a lesser amount.

On Wednesday, $1 million prizes were 
won in 16 states, and $2 million prizes were won in two states. 
California had six tickets among the winning ones Wednesday, including 
one sold in Nipton.

The
last major jackpot win came when a New Jersey man won a $338.3 million 
jackpot March 23. It is now considered the fourth largest Powerball 
jackpot in history.

For Nipton, folks feel they've already won thanks to the boom in business.‘It kind of disrupts our peace and quiet,’ said Handley, although she admits she too plans to snap up a ticket.

Most
of the talk she hears around town these days, she says, is of people 
daydreaming about quitting their jobs and traveling with their millions:
‘Everybody wants a piece of the pie.’But she said she would likely give most of it away.

‘Having a lot of money I think would 
be a lot of headache,’ she said. ‘Nipton has a lot of history. It's the 
place to come if you want to get away. We have a five-room bed and 
breakfast with no phones, no TVs, where you can sit and watch the trains
go by. It's our little piece of heaven. I have things money can't buy.’
