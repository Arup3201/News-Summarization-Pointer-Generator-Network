A callous conman who killed lonely millionairess Carole Waugh was today jailed for 27 years for a murder of ‘breathtaking wickedness.’

Rakesh Bhayani, 41, killed the upmarket escort and hid her body before plundering her life savings and attempting to sell her Marble Arch flat.

Together with Nicholas Kutner, 48, he used female impersonators to try and strip every asset Ms Waugh had ever owned in the hopes of hitting a ‘million pound jackpot.’

Her furniture and jewellery were sold
 and her bank accounts were emptied out by the pair. They also stole her
 identity and managed to defraud banks and other institutions of more 
then £250,000.

The Old
 Bailey heard how the pair blew the money on posh hotels, prostitutes 
and gambling - with Bhayani losing £200,000 at the roulette tables in 
London’s West End within just a few weeks.

It
 was only when the pair tried to sell Ms Waugh's flat for £750,000 with 
Kutner posing as Miss Waugh’s brother Chris that they were caught by 
police.

The jury found Bhayani guilty of murder and he admitted fraud and perverting the course of justice.

Kutner
 was cleared of murder but convicted of perverting the course of justice
 by helping to cover up the killing. He also admitted fraud.

Mr Justice Wilkie jailed Bhayani for life with a minimum recommendation of 27 years and ordered Kutner to serve 13 years.

He said the murder and 
subsequent dumping of the body was done with 'greed, callousness and 
total lack of any regard' for Ms Waugh.

Justice Wilkie told Bhayani: 'Then
 without a second thought, I am perfectly satisfied you and Kutner 
calmly set about stealing her identity, using it to defraud banks and 
other institutions.

‘You took steps to ensure her body would not be 
found for a sufficient time, not only to give you the best chance of 
avoiding detection but also to enable you to continue to embark on asset
 stripping.

‘You
 Kutner assisted and encouraged all in this in order to ensure that the 
flow of gold from the plundered Carole Waugh estate would not stop to it
 was all gone.'

Ms Waugh had worked in the oil 
industry in Libya and had invested money in her property, a shares portfolio and savings account.

She was wealthy enough to keep £30,000 in her current account and was generous and trusting with friends.

Ms Waugh met Bhayani in 2008 and the pair became casual lovers. She loaned him £12,000 which he claimed was for ‘treatment’ for his gambling problem and then another £40,000.

The court heard how Bhayani killed Ms Waugh, 49, at her flat in Marylebone, central London, after a row about money.

Her body was placed in a bag which was carried to a car. The vehicle was initially stored in a central London car park, then left in a rented garage in New Malden, south-west London.

The court heard Kutner was in the flat when Bhayani 
murdered Ms Waugh and was then on board with the actions to conceal her 
death and thwart the investigation into her murder.

The judge said Bhayani was the 
'instigator and chief organiser of the fraud' but both men spent Ms 
Waugh’s money on 'hotels, casinos and escorts'.

The judge said Bhayani’s actions in persisting with the fraud after killing Ms Waugh were 'breathtakingly wicked'.

'Your compulsion to feed your 
addictions to risk-taking and gambling and your amorality and 
selfishness overwhelmed any notion of decency or restraint,' he added.

Referencing
 the two men’s previous convictions, Mr Justice Wilkie said the men had 
an 'appalling record' for offences of dishonesty.

Before
 the sentencing, a statement from Ms Waugh’s family was read out in 
which she was described as 'loving, supportive and great fun'.

The
 statement, signed by her brother, Christopher Waugh, spoke of the 
'disbelief, dismay, darkness' as the family had to 'face our worst 
fears' in the wake of the murder.

The court heard that five days after Ms Waugh’s funeral, her mother collapsed and later died 'broken-hearted', unable to understand how and why the tragic events unfolded.

The statement said: 'She was loving, supportive and great fun. Her home visits were memorable.

'She always had great stories to tell. She turned these stories into adventures.

'For Mum, who rarely ventured out of the county of Durham, these stories were an insight not only into Carole’s life, but into the world as a whole. London, Libya, Australia, Italy, Dubai (to name but a few) were all brought to life by Carole.

'We all looked forward to Carole’s visits, especially Mum. They would plan shopping trips - nothing special but real quality time between a mother and a daughter.

'Happy days indeed,' the statement said.

Speaking
 after the sentencing, Mr Waugh said the two men jailed today were 
'greedy, evil conmen who don’t have a shred of decency between them'.

He
 added: 'They will sleep easily in their beds as they showed no remorse 
at all. I just can’t envisage any human being treating another human 
being like that.'

Detective Chief Inspector Justin Davies, of the Homicide and Major Crime Command (HMCC), said Ms Waugh’s murder was 'the senseless killing of a woman who put her trust in people she thought were her friends'.

He said: 'Bhayani clearly had no intention of friendship with Carole.

'Bhayani is a confidence trickster who murdered her and stripped her assets and the belongings she had worked hard for.

'Both men are compulsive liars who have deceived and defrauded their own families, friends and acquaintances throughout their entire adult lives. They went to extreme lengths to defraud Carole.

'Her body was placed in a boot of a 
car and left for months in car parks and a lock-up garage. Both men did 
not waste any time in spending her money, using it to buy gold, use 
prostitutes and live a champagne lifestyle.

'While
 Carole’s body lay undiscovered, they showed no regard for her family, 
who they knew were desperately seeking to trace her.

The crime scene in New Malden, south west London where Miss Waugh's body was discovered

'Ms Waugh was a wealthy woman; her years of hard work both in the UK and abroad were squandered in matter of three months.

'They took almost everything she worked for with exception of two bracelets which remained on her body. These were difficult to prise off her wrists and I have no doubt, if able to, they would have taken these items too.'

Jenny Hopkins, London deputy chief crown prosecutor, said: 'Carole Waugh was the victim of a cruel and callous plot to take her money during which she tragically lost her life.

'Rakesh Bhayani was a compulsive gambler who would bet, and lose, thousands of pounds at a time. He met Carole in 2008 and from then on she lent him various sums of money.

'In return for her generosity and kindness Bhayani plotted with Nicholas Kutner a complex fraud to steal her assets.

'After Bhayani brutally murdered Carole in April 2012, he and Kutner then proceeded to cynically conceal her death in furtherance of their plan to defraud her estate. They worked together to dispose of her body and to clean and remove her belongings from her flat.

'Kutner even posed as Carole’s brother, Chris, in order to try to rent and sell her £650,000 central London flat.

'We hope the convictions today give some small comfort to Carole Waugh’s family. Our thoughts are with them at this time.'
