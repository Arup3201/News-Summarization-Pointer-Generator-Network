The head of Homeland Security has told her staff that she will be leaving her post in order to become the president of the University of California school system.

Janet Napolitano reportedly told her staff about her decision to leave the Cabinet Friday morning, though it is not clear when exactly she would head to California from D.C.

The move from the Cabinet to the classroom comes as a slightly unexpected one, though it may show that she is broadening her national recognition in preparation for a future White House bid.

In addition to raising her profile, the move will inevitably lead to a massive pay raise: as a Cabinet Secretary, she has earned $200,000 per year, and while her new salary has not been released, the outgoing UC president made nearly three times as much, taking home $591,000 per year.

Leaving: Janet Napolitano announced to her staff that she will be stepping down as Secretary of Homeland Security to head the University of California school system

The 55-year-old was born in New York 
but spent much of her life in the southwest, having attended high school
in New Mexico, college at the University of California-Santa Clara, and
going on to practice law in Phoenix, Arizona.

Her new appointment is ground-breaking as she will be the first woman to run the state's 10-school system, but this is not the first time that she has broken the glass ceiling.

Emergency response: Much of Napolitano's time as head of Homeland Security has been spent dealing with natural disasters like the tornado in Moore, Oklahoma (pictured in May)

Before becoming the first woman to be the Secretary of Homeland Security when she came into office with President Obama in 2009, she was the first female governor of Arizona to win re-election. (She was the state's third female governor.)

Her time running a large federal agency- notorious for excessive bureaucratic red tape- is seen as one of her biggest assets.

'While some may consider her to be an unconventional choice, Secretary Napolitano is without a doubt the right person at the right time to lead this incredible university,' said Sherry Lansing who led the search committee.

'She will bring fresh eyes and a new sensibility -- not only to UC, but to all of California,' Lansing said to the Los Angeles Times. 

'She will stand as a vigorous advocate for faculty, students and staff at a time when great changes in our state, and across the globe, are presenting as many opportunities as challenges.'

President Obama released a statement just as the news broke, thanking Napolitano for her 'around the clock' work responding to natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the tornado in Joplin, Missouri.

'I’ve come to rely on Janet’s judgment and advice, but I’ve also come to value her friendship,' he said in the statement.

One of her biggest gaffes while Secretary
came after the attempted terrorist attack on an airplane on Christmas 
Day in 2009. Following the thwarted bombing, Napolitano said that 'the 
system worked' in an interview, but later clarified her remarks after 
the ensuing uproar.

Powerful position: Napolitano, seen sitting between President Obama and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in October, has worked for the Obama administration for the past four years

Through the years: Prior to being appointed to the Cabinet position, she worked as the Arizona Attorney General (left, in 1999) and the state's governor (right, in 2004)

'As she begins a new chapter in a remarkable career of public service, I wish her the best of luck,' the President said in the statement.

For her part, Napolitano released a statement saying that she wanted to take the new job so that she could 'play a role in educating our nation's next generation of leaders'.

'I thank President Obama for the chance to serve our nation during this important chapter in our history, and I know the Department of Homeland Security will continue to perform its important duties with the honor and focus that the American public expects.'

During the 2008 campaign when then-Senator Hillary Clinton was battling it out with Barack Obama to take the Democratic nomination for president, Napolitano was listed by The New York Times as a possible future female candidate.

Six years as the Democratic governor of a typically Republican state and four years as one of the country's top security agencies makes the prospect of a presidential bid seem within the realm of possibility.

California dreaming: Both Napolitano and her father attended UC-Santa Clara for their undergraduate degrees

In the past, her political opponents have started 'whisper' campaigns against her, hinting that the  never-married, childless 55-year-old is gay though she has always adamantly denied the claims.

She previously responded that she is 'just a straight, single workaholic'.

The timing of her departure, however, comes as a surprise to many as the debate over immigration is in the nascent stages. Her voice as head of the Department of Homeland Security- which manages the country's borders- would have been an important one to consider during talk of implementation of any new policies.

That said, she will not leave her Cabinet post until mid-September, meaning that she will still be weighing in on the proposed immigration changes.
