Vice President Joe Biden ran afoul of the nation's two most prominent fact-checkers on Thursday by claiming there's a 'large, very identifiable Somali community' in his home town, and many of them drive cabs.

He said Wednesday during the White House's 'Countering Violent Extremism' conference that riding in so many Somalis' cabs after train trips home helped him understand efforts by Minnesota officials to help Somali-American Muslims avoid turning into violent extremists. 

'If you ever come to the train station,' he said of WIlmington, Delaware, 'you may notice that I have great relations with them, because an awful lot of them are driving cabs, and are friends of mine.'

Religious and community leaders, largely Africans and Muslims, let out uncomfortable chuckles as he insisted: 'For real. I'm not being solicitous, I'm being serious.'

The Washington Post's Fact Checker column gave that claim 'Four Pinocchios.' The Tampa Bay Times' PolitiFact website rated it 'Pants on Fire.' 

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

YEAH! STEREOTYPES! Vice President Joe Biden got Four Pinocchios from the Washington Post for saying there were lots of Somali cab drivers in his native Delaware

Biden has attracted the wrong kind of attention with a series of gaffes over the years, including Tuesday's manhandling of Stephanie Carter, wife of the new Defense Secretary Ash Carter, during his swearing in ceremony

The Post's fact-checker gave Biden a 'Four Pinocchios' rating – its worst on a truthfulness scale, noting that CNN was unable to find WIlmington cab companies that hired Somali-American drivers.

'I don't think I've seen any in Delaware,' one taxi entrepreneur from Sierra Leone told the cable network. 'I see some Guinean(s), but no Somali drivers.'

One LIberian immigrant said he had driven Biden, whom he described as 'a nice guy. He's a very good man.'

But no Somalis, and no wonder: PolitiFact looked at U.S. Census data and found 'a whopping 15 Somalis in the entire state of Delaware.'

'That’s less than two one-thousandths of 1 percent of the state’s population.'

The Post looked at data from the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement and found that of the 75,000 Solamis resettled in the U.S. since 2000, 'exactly zero have arrived to live in Delaware.' 

Somali-Americans are concentrated mainly in in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota region, in Seattle, Washington, and in Columbus, Ohio.

'The vice president’s office did not even acknowledge our queries' about Biden's statements, the Post notes.

Biden's meander into a stereotype is reminiscent of a similar 2006 Biden gaffe involving Indian-Americans.

ARE THEY SOMALIS TOO? Biden posed Wednesday with longshoremen at the South Carolina Ports Authority terminal in Mount Pleasant, SC

During a Delaware campaign appearance, he told a supporter who appeared Indian that 'in Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India.'

'You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.' 

He said later on MSNBC that the somewhat racist quip 'was meant as a compliment.'

Racial insensitivity was also a problem for the vice president during his last presidential campaign, even affecting his comments about his future boss.

Biden said in 2007 of Barack Obama, then a U.S. Senator, that the future president was 'the first sort of mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and nice-looking guy.'

The vice president is trying to fashion himself as a viable presidential candidate in 2016, heading to New Hampshire next week to gauge his chances in the early primary state. 

He visited Iowa last week and spent time in South Carolina on Wednesday as part of an official trip to promote the White House's bid to spend heavily on infrastructure projects.

In Concord, New Hampshire, he will deliver an economic policy speech at The Warren B. Rudman Center for Justice, Leadership & Public Policy.

Then he will take part in a round-table discussion on higher education issues at Manchester Community College.
