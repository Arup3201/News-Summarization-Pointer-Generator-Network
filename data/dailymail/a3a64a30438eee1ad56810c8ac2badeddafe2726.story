A grandfather 'used like a football' by hooligans was today in a coma and fighting for his life after a matchday pub brawl that police broke up using CS gas.

Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin, 42, was found on the ground with serious head injuries following the fight involving about 15 people after his side’s match at Southend United in Essex.

Football fans have already raised more than £5,000 towards transport and accommodation costs for Mr Dobbin’s family, who are travelling from Mildenhall, Suffolk, to visit him in Southend Hospital.

His father-in-law Jim Faley told the Bury Free Press: ‘If Simon doesn’t come around soon, he may never wake up. We are all hoping - but in the back of our minds we are not 100 per cent sure.’

‘Even if he comes out in a wheelchair, at least he will still be with us. There were 12 to 15 guys who came out of the pub, they were singing and dancing, and then they just jumped them.

‘The doctors aren’t holding out much hope. They [the attackers] just used him like a football. According to some people, if it wasn’t for his friend laying on top of him they would have killed him.’

Father-of-three Mr Dobbin, who is married to Nicole, 43, suffered brain damage, damaged hips, broken ribs and a broken nose in the attack - and he is now on a life-support machine.

Terry Waye, manager of the Half Moon pub in Mildenhall, where Mr Dobbin is a regular, told the Cambridge News: ‘The last we have heard is that he may come off the ventilator on Wednesday. 

'But he will still be in a coma and he may not pull through. If he does he may never walk again and has suffered brain damage. He is the most gentle man I know and very kind.'

Scene: Mr Dobbin was found on the ground with serious head injuries following the fight involving about 15 people outside The Railway Tavern pub - next to Prittlewell train station, and a short walk from Roots Hall

Brawl: Police were called to the scene at about 7.20pm on Saturday, before arresting a 33-year-old man from Southend and a 23-year-old man from Westcliff on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm

Mr Dobbin's son Liam said on Facebook: ‘I can't explain how much we appreciate all the support.

‘My dad is a well-loved bloke who cares so much for everyone and it's nice to see when times get tough like this everyone pulls together and supports him. Thank you.’

The skirmish followed a League Two match between Southend and Cambridge at Roots Hall stadium, a short walk from The Railway Tavern pub - next to Prittlewell train station.

Police were called to the scene at about 7.20pm on Saturday, before arresting a 33-year-old man from Southend and a 23-year-old man from Westcliff on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The first was due to answer bail yesterday, while the latter was bailed to May 27.

Witnesses reported seeing about 20 police cars and a helicopter on Saturday night - while one fan claimed to have escorted his father and wife out of the pub's back door when the fighting began.

Dan Wilson, a Southend fan who lives near the pub and witnessed the scene from his home, told MailOnline: ‘We heard shouting coming from the pub, and saw about four guys coming out.

‘There were guys inside the pub trying to get out, and then the guys outside the pub started chucking a billboard outside through the door. All you could hear was glass being thrown.

‘Four guys started walking towards Prittlewell station down the hill and about 20 people ran across the road. Someone said “you've just hit my old man”. Then they've all gone into the pub.

‘I saw people running across the road - and two guys punched the window of the pub with their hand, before coppers dragged them away. It happened so quickly.’

Another supporter named Rayleigh Dan, writing on the Southend fans’ forum ShrimperZone, said on Saturday that he heard a window being broken before people in the pub rushed outside.

He added: ‘The next thing I knew the police had cordoned off the pub and we weren't allowed to leave for about an hour. Following this they examined everyone thoroughly.

‘We had to give full details of name and address, what we had and hadn't saw - they we're scanning and filming us with some sort of camera.

Confrontation: In a completely separate incident, fans also told of trouble outside the Spread Eagle pub – next to the football ground – before the match, and a video (above) showed supporters being moved along on the pavement outside

Tense scenes: Six Southend fans were issued with banning orders last season, compared to one from Cambridge, according to Home Office data. Pictured above is another view of scenes before the match

‘I'm not one for trouble so didn't recognise the device. It was horrible to experience and I hope anyone involved is caught and dealt with swiftly.’

A 47-year-old man from Cambridge was also arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage, after the pub’s door was smashed. He has since received a police caution.

Earlier, fans told of trouble outside the Spread Eagle pub – next to the football ground – before the match, and a video showed supporters being moved along on the pavement outside.

The game - which was billed in advance by Southend as a 'Community Day' - finished 0-0 and was attended by 7,224 fans, including 791 supporters from Cambridge.

Cambridge chairman Dave Doggett said: ‘The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Cambridge United are with Simon and his family and friends.’

And a Cambridge club statement said: ‘Simon Dobbin was walking to Prittlewell train station with his friend and a small group of fellow United fans after watching the rugby in a pub following the U's 0-0 draw at Southend on Saturday.

‘The U's fans made the 500m walk to Prittlewell station but were attacked as they made their way down towards the platform. Simon remains in Southend University Hospital in a critical condition.’

A statement on the website raising funds for Mr Dobbin - which had already doubled its £2,500 goal by 9am today – said: ‘A loving gentle giant who is a father, husband, son, brother, uncle, brother-in-law, son-in-law, grandad and a top friend was brutally beaten and left in a coma fighting for his life.

‘He is suffering brain damage. We are asking for your support and donations - however much you can afford - to help towards costs of transport and accommodation and any other general financial needs of Simon, his wife and children. I want to thank you for your donations and support. Please send a prayer to Simon for a full recovery.’

In addition, a charity football match has been organised in support of Mr Dobbin and his family at non-league side Mildenhall Town FC on Sunday at 1pm.  

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Our officers were called to the road following reports from members of the public that around 15 football supporters were fighting in the street near the Railway pub.' 

Six Southend fans were issued with banning orders last season, compared to one from Cambridge, according to the Home Office. Both figures are relatively low compared to other League Two clubs.
