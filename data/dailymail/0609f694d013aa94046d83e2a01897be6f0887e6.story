West Ham boss Sam Allardyce regrets taking his team on a 23,000 mile round trip to New Zealand where the Hammers suffered two embarrassing defeats and injury to striker Andy Carroll.

The former Liverpool man twisted his ankle badly during a training session and has since been ruled out for four months after undergoing an operation in America.

Allardyce's side also lost 2-1 to Wellington and 3-1 to Sydney during their tour, leaving them without a win in their first four friendlies of pre-season.

Ruled out: West Ham striker Andy Carroll has been ruled out for four months with an ankle injury

Allardyce: ‘We only just got back on Monday. Taking the journey 30 hours or so was probably too far.

‘They looked after us fantastically well and the games were well organised.

‘But we took a few injuries and that was probably the biggest disappointment.’
