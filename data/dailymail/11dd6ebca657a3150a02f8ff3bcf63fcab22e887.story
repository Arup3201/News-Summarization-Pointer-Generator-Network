Volcano Villarrica in southern
Chile erupted in the early hours of Tuesday, sending ash and
lava over 3,000-feet into the sky, and forcing the evacuation of nearby
communities.

The volcano, located near the popular tourist resort of
Pucon around 750 km (460 miles) south of the capital Santiago,
is one of South America's most active. It last erupted in 2000.

Television pictures showed orange lava and ash shooting into
the night sky when it erupted at around 3am local time, although it looked quieter as dawn broke. Some 3,385
people had been evacuated as a preventative measure, said
Interior Minister Rodrigo Penailillo.

This was partly because of the risk of floods caused by snow-melt.

Volcano Villarrica in southern Chile erupted in the early hours of Tuesday, sending ash andlava high into the sky, and forcing the evacuation of nearby communities

The sight of the volcano erupting was both terrifying and beautiful, with this photograph capturing its sheer ferocity

The government held an emergency meeting with the police and
military in the presidential palace in Santiago on Tuesday
morning to discuss the situation.

Chile, situated on the so-called Pacific Rim of Fire, has
the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after
Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active.

In 2011, the eruption of Puyehue sent an ash cloud into the
atmosphere that disrupted flights in neighboring Argentina for
months.

Penailillo said experts were flying over the Villarrica area
to determine next steps.

Photographer Nicolás Gallo, who witnessed the blast from his village just just five and half miles away, said: 'It was 3am in the morning and I was sleeping in my house that is in a village in the hills of the city of Villarrica, about six miles from it to the west. Villarrica city is between 14 and 18 miles from Villarrica volcano, to the east near the Andes.

'So I wake up because of my dad and went to see what was happening, the volcano was days before throwing incandescent matter, and suddenly it starts to throw lava an a big wave of smoke.

'It was like that for about 1 hour and 30 minutes, not much, then it stopped. Everything seems to be normal but we are in alert.'
