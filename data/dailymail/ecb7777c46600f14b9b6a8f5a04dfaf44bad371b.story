A new volcanic island off the coast of Japan has tripled in size since it formed just over a month ago, experts have said.

The land mass, which has now been named Niijima, was first spotted on November 20 in the Ogasawara chain around 600 miles south of Tokyo.

Initially, scientists were unsure how long it would last because volcanic islets of that type tend to be reclaimed by the sea after a short time.

However, the island has actually expanded to 56,000 square metres (13.8 acres) - around three times its size - as a result of continuing eruptions from the volcano below.

Rapid expansion: This picture taken on December 20 shows how Niijima has grown to three times its size in the last month thanks to fresh volcanic eruptions below the surface of the Pacific Ocean

According to National Geographic, the Japan Meteorological Agency says it now rises to around 80ft above sea level and Japanese scientists believe it is large enough to last for several years, perhaps for good.

A NASA satellite image taken on December 8 shows Niijima next to its closest island, the uninhabited Nishino Shima which lies around 500m away.

The discoloration of the water caused by the volcanic minerals and white puffs of steam and gases can also be seen.

The mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption on November 20 in a region dubbed Ring of Fire.

In September a similar new island appeared off the coast of Pakistan.

experts said it was unlikely to last long.

Although the area regularly experiences earthquakes and eruptions, they are rarely as powerful as the latest one.

In fact, the forming of the new island is the first time the phenomenon has happened in almost 30 years.

Video footage showed smoke billowing from part of the ocean around the Ogasawara island chain and the Japanese coastguard later confirmed it was coming from the new islet.

This chain is made up of over 30 
subtropical and tropical islands.

The islet is made up of volcanic lava and rocks forced from the ocean floor.

Volcanologists claim the temperature of the rocks could have been as high as 1,000C.

The coastguard warned sailors to use caution in the area and avoid travelling near it until the heat from the eruption cools off. 

He added that the islet may not last long due to erosion, but if enough volcanic lava surfaces and solidifies it could create a new marker on the map.

Similar eruptions in the early 1970s and 80s created tiny islets in Japan's territory that have since disappeared.

The new islet rose into the ocean near the Bonin Islands, also known as the Ogasawara chain. This chain is made up of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands around 620 miles south of the Japanese capital, pictured

‘If this becomes a solid island, our country's territorial waters will expand,’ Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said.

In November this year, a powerful volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean created a new island off the coast of Japan, pictured. The mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region dubbed Ring of Fire - a hub of seismic activity situated 620 miles south of Tokyo

Experts said the islet, pictured, may not last long due to erosion, but if enough volcanic lava surfaces and solidifies it could create a new islet a new entry on the map

The islet was 600ft in diameter when it appeared off south coast of Tokyo

Now measures nearly 60,000 square feet and rises 80ft above sea level

Scientists doubted it would survive but now think it could last forever
