The ex national music promoter used the property primarily to house famous celebrities while they were touring Australia and were in Queensland including Elton John and Fleetwood Mac

Critton Astras at Realty Special Projects confirmed it was sold to Prosper Holdings Pty Ltd, which is associated with Stanley Chan and while quoted as been sold for $7.16, he said it actually went for $8.2 million.

He says the ex national music promoter used the property primarily to house famous celebrities while they were touring Australia and were in Queensland.

'For the last 20 years, he's had Russian acts like the Russian ballet stay there, had celebrities like Fleetwood Mac, Elton John,' he said.

'It was known as the celebrity estate.'

Mr Critton says the property, which was listed with a number of real estate agencies, has been on the market for around three years and has been kept in immaculate condition.

'He kept it in show style and as the market picked up in the last 18 months, Graham was looking for the right buyer for his property which he believed was very unique,' he said.

'He was a very educated owner, he has a lot more knowledge than a lot of real estate agents in Queensland.'

He believes the sale of property could be the second highest for 2014 behind 60 Admiralty Drive, Paradise Waters, which sold for $8.7 million, reported by the Gold Coast Bulletin.

Mr Critton says about eight years ago, Graham purchased the run down property and in the last couple of years spent over $1 million redeveloping it.

'Graham moved to the Sunshine coast, he has two boys, family, grandchildren and he wanted to spend time with them,' he said.

'Chinese buyers have been looking at properties in this area because it's close to amenities, safe, central, on the water and is large parcels of land.'

'The Chinese have a good eye and look at the value of the property and compare, they definitely know their markets in Sydney and Melbourne and also Brisbane.'

It's believed there has suddenly been some movement in prestige properties in the area after several years of the market staying stagnant.

The real estate agent says another Chinese buyer has just signed a contract for a $4.5 million property on similar acreage but on a smaller block in the area, but the house will most likely be knocked down and redeveloped.

Mr Critton says in the last two weeks he has also been contracted to sell a variety of villas, studios and eco cabins at the popular Couran Cove resort, on Stradbroke Island.

The development by an American billionaire, which cost $150 million went into receivership two years ago and Brisbane businessman, Craig Dowling picked up the resort for a steal of less than $10 million.

The last couple of years have been spent redeveloping the resort and a number of residences are now up for sale.

'Villas are from $200,000,' said Mr Critton, 'on the water, overlooking the marina.'

'You can only get there by boat but I've been contracted to market and sell them, which for that price you wouldn't be able to get land almost anywhere.'
