Winger Brek Shea has left Stoke and returned to the United States to join Major League Soccer side Orlando City.

The 24-year-old was signed by former Stoke boss Tony Pulis from FC Dallas for £2.5million in January 2013 but made only five appearances for the Potters in nearly two years at the club.

Shea was loaned to Barnsley last season and returned to Stoke earlier this month after another loan spell with Birmingham but has failed to force himself into manager Mark Hughes' plans.

Brek Shea, in action during a rare appearance for Stoke City, has moved back to America after two years

The American spent time on loan at Birmingham this season, but has been unable to establish himself

Stoke announced the news in a short statement on their website on Friday evening, saying: 'Stoke City can confirm that Brek Shea has left the Britannia Stadium to join American Major League Soccer side Orlando City.

'Stoke City would like to wish Brek every success in the future.'

Shea has 27 caps for the USA but did not make the squad for the World Cup in Brazil.

Shea's lack of playing time has seen him fall out of the United States squad in the past two years
