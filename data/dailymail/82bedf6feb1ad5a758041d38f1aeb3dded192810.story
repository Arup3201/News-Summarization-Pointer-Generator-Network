David Bowie sharing a cigarette with Elizabeth Taylor in  1975. This was the first occasion  the pair - who had an 'amorous friendship' - had met

David Bowie was a sex fanatic who became obsessed with bedding as many partners - men or women - as possible, a new book claims.

Bowie's colourful, gender-bending sex life has included rumored relationships with Elizabeth Taylor and Bianca Jagger as well as ones - which the women have themselves confirmed - with Marianne Faithfull and Susan Sarandon.

But he has also been linked with a string of men including Mick Jagger - rumours that were encouraged by Bowie's past claims to have been both gay and bi-sexual.

In a new book, Bowie, author Wendy Leigh spoke to the singer's friends, ex-lovers, business associates and industry insiders to ask whether he was a sex addict or a show business star who was keen to make himself seem more exciting to fans.

Nowadays, Bowie, 67, is a father and lives in conventional matrimony with his Somali supermodel second wife, Iman.

However, according to extracts of the new book published in the New York Daily News, Leigh believes that Bowie was only ready to settle down after satisfying a voracious sexual appetite.

Leigh describes how Bowie and his first wife, Angie, ‘were notorious about weaving a sexual web around those who took their fancy’ and met while they were having an affair with the same man.

Bowie, born in Brixton and raised in modest circumstances in the London suburb of Bromley, was determined to break into London’s music scene. According to Leigh he became ‘adept at playing London’s gay elite’.

A Bowie acquaintance from those years put it more bluntly, saying: ‘I said he would either be a gigantic star or make a lot of money in the Piccadilly men’s loo.’

Angie, a former model, worked for the music executive Lou Reizner, boss of Mercury Records, who helped make Bowie a star.

But according to Leigh, Reizner couldn't stand Bowie and helped him only because he feared losing Angie if he didn't, says Leigh.

But Angie - who has been credited with playing an instrumental role in moulding Bowie's flamboyant images in his heyday - was desperately keen to become the girlfriend of an emerging rock star. 

In 1969 - the year of his first hit song Space Oddity - Angie helped Bowie move into a crumbling mansion, Haddon Hall in Bromley. There she catered to his every need, treating him as ‘a pampered prince’ and even running him a bath every morning.

According to Leigh, American-born Angie had an ‘uncanny ability to bring home the most free-spirited girls’. They weren't ready just to hop into bed with the bisexual couple but even with others visiting the house, she says.

The couple married and had a son named Zowie - derived from the Greek word for life - on May 30, 1970.

When he met Iman at a party in 1990, Bowie revealed: 'I was naming the children the night we met'

At the same time, Bowie and Angie were working together on his next on-stage and recording persona, the sexually-ambiguous Ziggy Stardust. Bowie insisted to an interviewer at the time that ‘I’m gay and always have been'.

A former member of staff at Bowie's record company told Leigh that Bowie had bedded pretty much everyone who worked there, sometimes repeatedly.

But at least one of Bowie’s male lovers wondered whether Bowie was actually gay or bisexual - or hankering for attention.

‘When we were in bed together, he was more sensual and narcissistic,’ said Tony Zanetta, Bowie’s ex-assistant. ‘To him, it was about being adored... I don’t think sex mattered to him.’

On a US tour in 1972, Angie started a relationship with her husband’s Jamaican bodyguard. But, says Leigh, Mrs Bowie would also join her husband for threesomes with any of the groupies - male or female - who crowded around him.

In their new London home in Chelsea, Angie attempted to enclose her wayward husband in a ‘sexual cocoon’ that kept him close to her while allowing him to indulge his appetites for other sexual partners.

Their home in Oakley Street boasted what they called 'the pit', a four-foot-deep bed covered in fur in the living room, where they would entertain guests.

‘Angie and David used to have the most amazing orgies at Oakley St. Everybody f****d everybody in the pit. Mick Jagger used to come there and be involved with sexual things,’ a source told Leigh.

As Bowie spiralled into a cocaine addiction and became painfully thin, the drugs fuelled his sex drive and he became ‘dedicated to having sex with as many partners as possible’, says Leigh.

Bowie has himself admitted as much, once telling a BBC interviewer: 'I was hitting on everybody. I had a wonderfully irresponsible, promiscuous time.'

While the singer's relationship with Angie was never mutually exclusive, she reveals that she felt more comfortable about some of his lovers than others.

And so while Faithfull had been part of their orgy-pit scene, she was suspicious about his relationship with Bianca Jagger and was upset to see them photographed together shortly after her marriage to Mick ended. To her, the former Stones wife represented a serious threat to their marriage.

As for Bianca's ex-husband, Angie famously claims she once found Jagger and Bowie naked in bed together.

David Bowie is currently a stay-at-home dad and is so rarely in the public eye now that some call him a recluse

Although an ageing Elizabeth Taylor - 15 years his senior - was rumoured to be one of Bowie's most famous conquests, Leigh merely describes their relationship as ‘an amorous friendship’.

She wasn't the only older woman with whom he was linked. Bowie was rumoured to have started an affair with Oona Chaplin, widow of Charlie and 20 years older than him, when he was playing The Elephant Man on stage in 1980.

Leigh also describes how the guitarist Slash was just eight-years-old when he walked into a room at home and found Bowie naked with his mother, Ola Hudson.

Sixties singer Ronnie Spector, ex-wife of record producer Phil Spector, recalled how she was taken to see him after he performed in New York in 1976. She was led directly to his hotel suite where he was waiting for her, naked.

In the late 1970s, Bowie began denying that he had ever been gay or bisexual, insisting it was an image concocted by his managers.

His affair with actress Susan Sarandon which lasted three years, after a daliance Oona Chaplin - widow of Charlie Chaplin - who was almost 20 years older than Bowie.

Bowie, who split up with Angie in 1980, has admitted he has an addictive personality and Leigh speculates whether it applied not only to drugs but also to sex.

If so, he shook the habit. He certainly seemed to have slowed down considerably in the bedroom department by the time he met Iman at a party in Los Angeles in 1990. He said later: ‘I was naming the children the night we met.

‘It was so lucky that we were to meet at that time in our lives, when we both were yearning for each other.’
