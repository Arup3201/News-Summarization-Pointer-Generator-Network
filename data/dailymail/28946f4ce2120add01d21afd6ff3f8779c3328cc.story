The number of hayfever sufferers in the UK will double to reach 30 million in the next two decades as rising pollution levels trapping pollen in the atmosphere, experts have warned.

The affliction already means a miserable summer for 15 million people in the UK.

One in five battle streaming eyes, incessant sneezing and irritating itches at the back of the throat and deep in the inner ear.

And while the soaring temperatures and bright sunshine is the most welcome of sights, for many it is a double-edge sword bringing with it the dreaded clouds of invisible pollen.

Experts have estimated the number of hayfever sufferers in the UK will double in the next 20 years, reaching 30 million in two decades

Research carried out at the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit at Worcester University has found two factors - weather and pollution - are inextricably linked with the summer allergy.

Hayfever is twice as common in towns and cities as in the countryside, largely, scientists say, because of higher levels of traffic pollution.

Fumes from cars, vans and lorries create a 'photochemical smog' which traps pollen, preventing it from escaping into the upper atmosphere.

The effect is to concentrate the troublesome spores at ground level, within reach of hayfever sufferers.

Beverley Adams-Groom, chief pollen forecaster at the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit said weather is also a contributory factor.

'Weather and pollen are closely linked,' she said.Â  'Since 2007, poor weather has meant average pollen seasons.

'The mild, wet weather of the late winter and early spring is responsible for increased pollen levels this year.

'This year there has been good grass 
growth as a result of the pre-summer climate and we are increasingly 
experiencing longer, more intense pollen seasons.

'With a dry British summer predicted there is potential for a severe hayfever season in 2014.'

Experts say rising pollution levels is part of the reason for an increasing number of people suffering hayfever. The smog acts as a barrier, preventing pollen from escaping into the upper atmosphere and triggering allergic reactions as temperatures rise

While hayfever may loom ominously on the horizon for millions as summer gathers pace, experts say there are remedies and treatments available to ease the symptoms.

Boots UK Pharmacist Angela Chalmers, said the glorious weather encouraging more people outside, could explain the rise in hayfever sufferers.

She said: 'With the sun starting to shine we're more likely to be having fun outdoors which could mean we become more sensitive to pollen, but there is no reason for hayfever to stop you enjoying the summer.

'Approximately 12.5 million of us over 20 years old now experience hayfever symptoms in the UK - thought to be because of environmental factors such as urbanisation and air pollution.

'With a range of options available to help you stay in control of your hayfever you do not have to let a tingly nose or watery eyes keep you from making the most of the outdoors.

'You can get great tips and guidance from your local pharmacist to help you feel in control this summer if hayfever triggers your asthma symptoms.

'From inhaler techniques to reducing your exposure to the allergens which can affect your asthma, speak to your pharmacist early on so you can make the most of the warmer weather.'

Ms Chalmers added: 'Sunglasses not 
only provide UV protection for your eyes - they can also help keep 
hayfever symptoms at bay when the pollen count is high.

'Pollen can 
also stick to clothes and hair so brushing and washing both regularly 
are easy ways to ensure hayfever does not hold you back this summer.'

Ms Chalmers advised speaking to a pharmacist to make the most of the wide range of options available to tailor treatment plans.

ANTI-HISTAMINES

Anti-histamines treat hayfever by blocking the action of the chemical histamine.

The body releases the chemical when it thinks it is under attack from an allergen.

Anti-histamines can be effective at treating itching, sneezing and watery eyes, but they do not clear the blocked nose most those with hayfever will suffer.

The drugs, which are available in tablet form and also as nasal sprays, can be used as an 'as-required' treatment as well as a preventative one.

Anti-histamines treat hayfever by blocking the chemical histamine, which is produced by the body when it senses it is under attack from an allergen

CORTICOSTEROIDS (steroids)

When pollen triggers an allergic reaction, the inside of the nose becomes inflamed.

Corticosteroids can reduce this inflammation and prevent the symptoms of hay fever.

GPs can prescribe corticosteroid nasal sprays or drops if a person has persistent hayfever that does not respond to anti-histamines or the main symptom is a blocked nose.

The steroids can be more effective than anti-histamines, especially if started about two weeks before symptoms usually begin.

NASAL SPRAYS AND EYE DROPS

Nasal sprays can help prevent hayfever symptoms and reduce congestion by acting as a barrier to airborne allergens.

Decongestants delivered via a nasal spray reduce the swelling of the blood vessels in your nose, which opens your nasal passage and makes breathing easier.

Redness, itchiness and watering of the eyes can all be eased with eye drops.

NUTRITION AND HAYFEVER

Eating foods rich in sources of Omega-3 can reduce coughs and wheezes, by reducing inflammation.Omega-3 is commonly found in oily fish, including mackerel and sardines.

Garlic can also help battle the seasonal sniffles. It is a natural anti-histamine, combating the histamine chemical produced by the body in response to inflammation triggered by pollen.

And a cup of tea, either English Breakfast or green, is known to take the edge of symptoms.

A cuppa contains an antioxidany known as quercetin, which prevents the inflammation caused by hayfever.

HONEY

A well-known remedy for beating hayfever is a teaspoon of honey each day.

The theory is that local honey is contaminated with local pollen, which can help desensitise a sufferer.

Eating honey from within 10 miles of home, two months before the pollen season is said to help sufferers build up a tolerance and take the edge of the symptoms.

The Met Office monitors pollen levels, publishing pollen forecasts up to five days in advance. The map shows the average pollen levels across the UK

LIFESTYLE TIPS

Ms Chalmers said there are a range of lifestyle tips that can help to ease the symptoms of hayfever.

There is a link between stress and the onset of symptoms, as stress levels drop the sneezing, itching and congestion is thought to become milder.

Regular exercise can also improve hayfever, with those who are regularly active commonly complaining of less severe symptoms.

Ms Chalmers said it is also important to get a good night's sleep, to help the body re-charge and deal better with the symptoms. Closing windows at night can also help, stopping pollen from invading the home.

She added that alcohol is known to worsen the effects of pollen. Beer, wine and other spirits contain histamine, the chemical which triggers an allergic reaction in the body.

When itching at the back of the mouth becomes unbearable, chewing gum can also help releive the irritation.

Tiny grains of pollen measure about one millionth of an inch across, and are released by flowering plants in spring and summer.

They are little bundles of DNA, each enclosed in a tough protein coat which protects the genetic material inside.

This
 protein coat can, in some people, trigger a violent allergic reaction. 
It appears to cause the body's immune system to mount an attack, similar
 to when the body is invaded by harmful bacteria and viruses.

Tiny grains of pollen, seen under the microscope, measure about one millionth of an inch across and are released by flowering plants in spring and summer.

The body releases histamines into the bloodstream, and this causes the inflammation in the sinuses, eyes and airways.

As few as 50 pollen grains per cubic yard of air is classified as a 'high' pollen count, and is enough to trigger hayfever.

The pollen count begins to rise in March and stays high throughout the summer, usually tailing off in August. Some years though levels can rise as early as January, with sufferers experiencing symptoms as late as November.

The season is separated into three main sections:

particularly notorious for inducing symptoms of hayfever.'
