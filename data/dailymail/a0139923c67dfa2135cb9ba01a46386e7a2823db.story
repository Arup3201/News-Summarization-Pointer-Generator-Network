Newcastle face losing up to four players to the Africa Cup of Nations in January after Mehdi Abeid won a maiden call-up to the Algeria squad and Sammy Ameobi reiterated his desire to play for Nigeria.

Senegal striker Papiss Cisse and Ivory Coast midfielder Cheick Tiote are already established internationals and, should their respective countries qualify, they would be included for the 16-team tournament which kicks off on January 17 in Morocco.

But Abeid now looks set to play his part for Algeria with the Desert Foxes having already guaranteed their place at the finals.

The 22-year-old has been named in their senior squad for the first time this week for the forthcoming qualifiers against Ethiopia and Mali.

Abeid – born in France to Algerian parents – has been rewarded for breaking in to Newcastle's first-team and impressing during the recent victories over Manchester City and Liverpool.

Winger Ameobi, meanwhile, is hoping to win a place in the Nigeria squad alongside brother Shola, who represented the Super Eagles at the World Cup.

'I'm looking to get involved in the national team,' said the 22-year-old, who, like Abeid, has made an impact for the Magpies of late.

'Hopefully, I can do that. I'd just like to play alongside Shola again. I'm looking forward to that, but the most important thing is playing here for Newcastle.

'If I get an opportunity, I need to take it. If Nigeria happens, it's a bonus.'
