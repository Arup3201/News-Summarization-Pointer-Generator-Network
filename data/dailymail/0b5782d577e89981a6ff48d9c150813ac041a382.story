Tara Palmer-Tomkinson leaked a story to the News 
of the World about Prince 
William's 21st birthday party, the phone hacking trial has been told.

The tabloid’s former royal editor Clive Goodman told the Old Bailey that the socialite and former I'm A Celebrity... contestant had been a source of stories for the then editor Andy Coulson.

Goodman claimed Ms Palmer-Tomkinson leaked news of an incident in 2003 when 
comedian Aaron Barschak breached security at the Prince's birthday party while dressed as Osama bin Laden.

Goodman told the Old Bailey: 'The source was Tara Palmer-Tomkinson who was a contact of Mr Coulson's.'

'She was a guest at the party, phoned Mr Coulson, and Mr Coulson phone me and passed on the information.'

'I then phoned Tara to get some information myself and put the story together with the help of members of the Royal household and calls to Scotland Yard.'

The story about the breach of security at Prince William's birthday later made the front page of the News of the World.

During today's hearing Goodman also claimed that private detective Glenn Mulcaire had wanted to defect to The Sun because he felt he was being badly treated by the News of the World.

The tabloid was trying to cut Mulcaire’s weekly retainer for hacking phones, the Old Bailey heard, leaving him ‘irritated’ at his treatment.

Mulcaire had already resorted to setting up a side project with Goodman to boost his earnings, the former Royal editor claimed, with Mulcaire asking him to line up a move to The Sun in 2006.

Earlier today, Coulson’s lawyer Timothy Langdale QC alleged that Goodman’s career was 'in decline' by the time his client became editor of the tabloid.

Mr Langdale described Goodman as 'work-shy' and 'out of touch', and said he had been nicknamed 'the Eternal Flame' in the office as he never went out.

Goodman defended his record, saying: You did not get stories in a small circle of royals going out and knocking on doors.'

He said his stories were rejected by the news desk because Coulson and another colleague, Neil Wallis, 'did not like what I was doing'.

Goodman, who was jailed in 2007, denies conspiring to commit misconduct by paying public officials. Coulson denies conspiring to hack phones and conspiring to commit misconduct.

Former Sun and News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks denies conspiring to hack phones, misconduct and perverting the course of justice.

The trial continues.
