A death-defying free runner who scales buildings and mountains without a harness has captured some truly breathtaking images on his travels around the world.

Esty Ilabaca from Moreton on the Wirral, Merseyside, has parkoured his way across the globe in pursuit of the perfect shot, and captured on film are the terrifying levels in which the 20-year-old is prepared to go to in order to find it.

The video depicts Ilabaca casually strolling along the top of a skyscraper, before leaning out over the edge of it. And despite breathing heavily throughout the clip the young man appears to be completely at home at the terrifying height.

The video also shows the daredevil jumping a barrier to tight-rope along a part of the building's structure, all the while his helmet camera rolls picking up the sights around him.

Showcasing his skills in parkour – a discipline that uses movement developed from military obstacle training and translates as 'art of motion' – Ilabaca also makes a jump between two buildings and later completes a double jump from the top of a building to the ground.

And his portfolio of images from around the globe include a picture of Los Angeles’ Venice Beach, a shot overlooking Higashikurume, Tokyo and even an image of his leg dangling from the iconic Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

Closer to home, Ilabaca also has a number of photographs that feature friends, including one that overlooks the London skyline as well as a number of shots taken over Liverpool – one of which is truly incredible and features a man balancing himself precariously on top of a narrow pole.
