Arsene Wenger believes the attacking weapons already at his disposal will be enough come the business end of the season despite the widely held belief his Arsenal squad lacks a top level striker.

Despite being linked with a number of available stars during the transfer window - including Mario Balotelli and Edinson Cavani - Wenger is preparing fans for the news that there may be no news on any further additions to his line-up before Monday's deadline.

The imminent return of Yaya Sanogo from injury boosts the manager's options up front after Wenger reinforced his faith in Olivier Giroud, whose winning header at the death against Everton on Saturday snatched a hard-fought draw.

Managing expectations: Arsenal fans should be prepared to not see a new striker before Monday's deadline

'We have [Yaya] Sanogo who will be an important asset, we have Giroud, we have Lukas Podolski, we have Joel Campbell who can play centre forward,’ he said.

‘We have Alexis [Sanchez] and [Theo] Walcott coming back. Let’s not forget that.' 

Out of all the names Wenger lists though, only the French 21-year-old Sanogo joins Giroud as a recognised striker - with the others, despite what the players themselves think, preferred in wider positions. 

Sanogo impressed in the preseason, with a four goal blitz in 22 minutes against Benfica the pick of his performances. He's anything but the finished article, but Wenger showed signs he clearly rates the young striker by starting him in the Community Shield final against Manchester City and in their Premier League opener against Crystal Palace.

Front line: Olivier Giroud is Wenger top-choice striker, with 21-year-old Sanogo emerging as his understudy

On the attack: Costa Rica's Joel Campbell, who's returned from loan, can also play in a forward position

Threat: Chile forward Alexis Sanchez is also strong in the final third, though not a recognised striker

As far as Wenger is concerned, he's better to be happy with what he has than to try and shoe-horn an expensive No 9 into his system.  

‘All of our opponents look for strikers as well and nobody finds a world-class striker available who is better than the strikers you have,’ he says. 

'You don’t put a pot of players together and bring in people just to have them there.'
