U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton today handed a letter from President Barack Obama to the leader of Burma's democracy movement, Ang San Suu Kyi, as the two women met for the first time.

In it, Mr Obama thanks the Nobel Peace Prize winner 'for the inspiration you provide all of us around the world who share the values of democracy, human rights, and justice.'

'We stand by you now and always,' he vows in the letter, which was released by the State Department.

Historic handshake: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and pro-democracy opposition leader Ang San Suu Kyi meet at the US Chief of Mission Residence in Rangoon today

Mrs Clinton had a private dinner with Suu Kyi today at the U.S. Chief of Mission residence in Yangon, a highlight of her historic visit to Myanmar.

Suu Kyi, a long-time political 
prisoner and now the country's opposition leader, has said she will run 
in the forthcoming elections.

Earlier,
Mrs Clinton spoke of a 'new chapter in the shared history' of America 
and Burma after offering the the isolated country a small package of 
rewards for moving towards democratisation.

It followed a pivotal meeting with Burma's leader Thein Sein at his spectacular presidential palace.

Mrs
Clinton said the U.S. was ready to further improve relations with the 
Burma's civilian government, but made it clear more must be done by the 
nation, including breaking its military ties with North Korea.

The U.S. Secretary of State said she 
had 'candid, productive' conversations with President Thein Sein and 
other Myanmar ministers, and told them Washington stood ready to support
further reforms as the country seeks to emerge from decades of 
authoritarian military rule.          

During
her visit, Mrs Clinton offered the country future incentives, including
the prospect of upgraded diplomatic ties, in return for steps that 
include releasing political prisoners and ending ethnic violence with 
aggressive efforts at national reconciliation.

She
also announced that Washington would allow Burma to participate in a 
U.S.-backed grouping of Mekong River countries; no longer block enhanced
co-operation between the country and the International Monetary Fund; 
and support intensified UN health, microfinance and counter-narcotics 
programmes.

In the 
grand, ornate surroundings of President Thein Sein's parliamentary 
compound in Naypyitaw, Mrs Clinton said: 'I came to assess whether the 
time is right for a new chapter in our shared history.

Promise: President Thein Sein vowed that Burma would uphold its UN obligations of cutting military ties with North Korea

'The United States is prepared to walk the path of reform with you if you keep moving in the right direction.'

After
decades of repressive military rule, Mrs Clinton said President Obama 
was willing to explore improved and expanded ties 'to reward reforms 
with steps to lessen (Burma's) isolation and improve the lives of its 
citizens'.

In an ornate room at Naypidaw's presidential palace - a huge building with 40ft to 60ft ceilings replete with gold gilt, giant teak doors and white marble floors that lies off an enormoU.S. but empty 20-lane motorway - Mr Sein appeared eager to embrace the opening with the United States.

He told Mrs Clinton her visit was a 'historic milestone' which would 'enhance relations and co-operation'.

A senior U.S. official said Mr Sein had outlined his government's plans for reform in a 45-minute presentation in which he acknowledged that Burma lacked a recent tradition of democracy and openness.

He asked for U.S. help in making the transition from military to full civilian rule, according to the official.

Mrs Clinton replied that she was visiting because the U.S. was 'encouraged by the steps that you and your government have taken to provide for your people'.

But she also made clear that those steps must be consolidated and enlarged if the U.S. is to consider easing near-blanket economic sanctions that block almost all American commercial transactions with Burma.

'While measures already taken may be unprecedented and certainly welcome, they are jUst a beginning,' she told reporters.

She called for the release of political prisoners and an end to brutal ethnic violence which has ravaged the nation for decades.

Mrs
Clinton also warned the country's leadership to break suspected 
military, nuclear and ballistic missile co-operation with North Korea 
that may violate UN sanctions.

'Better
relations with the United States will only be possible if the entire 
government respects the international consensus against the spread of 
nuclear weapons... and we support the government's stated intention to 
sever military ties with North Korea,' she said.

In
his presentation, Mr Sein vowed that Burma would uphold its UN 
obligations with respect to North Korea, according to the senior U.S. 
official.

He also told Mrs 
Clinton that Burma was actively considering signing a new agreement with
the UN nuclear watchdog which would allow unfettered inspections of 
atomic sites in the country, the official said.

Recalling
Mr Obama's mention of 'flickers of progress' in Burma when he announced
that Mrs Clinton was to visit the country, she urged the leadership not
to allow them to 'be stamped out'.

'It will be up to the leaders and the people to fan flickers of progress into flames of freedom that light the path toward a better future,' she said.

'That - and nothing less - is what it will take for U.S. to turn a solitary visit into a lasting partnership.'

Clinton's landmark visit to the country also known as Burma marks a tentative rapprochement after more than 50 years of estrangement from the West.

She will travel on Thursday to the commercial capital of Yangon, where she will hold the first of two meetings with veteran pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
