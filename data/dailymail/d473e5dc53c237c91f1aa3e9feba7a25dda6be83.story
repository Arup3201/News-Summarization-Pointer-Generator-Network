Carla Bruni may no longer officially be the first lady of France but she can still command worldwide attention.

The model turned musician, 45, has given an interview to television show 'CNBC Meets...', hosted by Tania Bryer, in which she reveals all about her whirlwind romance with former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and how their lives have changed since he lost power.

The couple raised eyebrows when they tied the knot just three months after meeting at a dinner party in 2008 not long after he had divorced his second wife, Cécilia.

But Carla, who has a son, Aurelien, 11, from a previous relationship with the French philosopher Raphael Enthoven, said she just knew it was 'a match'.

In the interview that will air on Wednesday night, she said: 'It was love at first sight. I must say, we left the dinner party together. People were like... (laughs) and we got married three months after.'

Speaking about what attracted her to the 58-year-old, who has three sons from his previous relationships, she said: 'I don't know, his intelligence, his charisma, his kindness, his way of talking.'

She added: 'What is it about someone we love? It's hard to tell, I can see how many qualities he has but, is love coming from that? No. I think it's a match, so you know. It's a sparkle. I think it's a mystery.'

During his reign as president, Carla gave birth to their daughter, Giulia in October 2011. She said as a result it was a 'relief' when her husband then lost the 2012 election to Francois Hollande.

She said: 'I was very happy to leave and I 
was very happy to spend five years at Elysee. I was also relieved 
because my man is so much like a hundred percent person. I thought 
he might get a little rest and go back to a normal 
life, have more time for the children.

'One of his children already has 
children themselves so my husband is a grandfather so now it's 
like a really nice family life. I must say it's nice because the 
pressure goes off and that's really pleasant.' 

Leaving office: While she enjoyed being France's first lady, Carla said it was a relief when her husband wasn't re-elected last year

The pressure being off has allowed Carla to return to modelling - recently posing in a campaign for Bulgari - and further her music career.

This summer she released her fourth self-penned studio album - Little French Songs.

She said she gets her inspiration 'from life' and confessed that one number on the album is a love song for her husband, even though she didn't name it after him.

She explained of the song 'Mon Raymond': 'Of course (my husband) he's not called
Raymond, he's called Nicolas, but I thought Raymond is a good name. 
It's very old fashioned, it's very French.

The real Raymond: Carla told Tania who her love song is really about

'I said "I make a song about 
you called Raymond, you don't mind?" He said, "non"  and then sometimes I
call him Raymond for fun!'

She added: 'It's just a love song. Describing him - how I see him how I feel about him. It's funny 
because he's been such a public person and so this song is maybe a 
little bit of a private eye on him.'  CNBC Meets Carla Bruni will air on CNBC on 14 August at 10pm
