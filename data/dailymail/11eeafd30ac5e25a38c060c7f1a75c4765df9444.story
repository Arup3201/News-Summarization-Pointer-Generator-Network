The company who provides and maintains the faulty scaffolding that left two men dangling 69 stories in the air at the World Trade Center on Wednesday afternoon has had two other major incident in just the past six years.

The Tractel Group, the U.K. based company that is responsible for the equipment at the $3.9 billion skyscraper, even had one worker fall to their death using their equipment.

This in addition to an incident just last year that is remarkably similar to what happened on Wednesday.

Problem company: The Tractel Group, the U.K. based company that is responsible for the scaffolding at One World Trade Center (above), has had three life-threatening incidents in seven years

Stuck: In June 2013, two workers were stuck at the Hearst Tower in New York City when their scaffold buckled (above)

On December 9, 2007, Alcides Moreno and his brother Edgar plummeted 500 feet down the Solow Tower in New York City when the mechanical system on their rig failed.

Edgar died immediately, while Alcides somehow managed to hold on, this despite bleeding in his brain, a collapsed lung and broken bones throughout his body.

He could not speak for weeks, and initially even the slightest movement could have been deadly.

He miraculously managed to recover, and never again washed windows.

On June 12, 2013, an incident unfolded at Manhattan's Hearst Tower that was almost exactly like what happened at One World Trade on Wednesday.

Two scaffold-maintenance workers got caught between the forty-fourth and forty-fifth floors of the building.

These two men, Stephen Schmidt and Victor Carballo, had their scaffolding buckle on them, and were waiting 90 minutes for firefighters to cut through the glass in the building and pull them in.

And, as AOL points out, both of these incidents occurred with  equipment from The Tractel Group.

There is no word yet if the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will attempt to get out of their contract with Tractel following this latest incident.

The two men trapped outside and almost 1,000 feet high for 90 minutes yesterday, Juan Lopez and Juan Lizama, suffered no injuries, but were immediately rushed to New York City's Bellevue Hospital where they were treated for minor hypothermia.

Lizama revealed in an interview that he was so certain that the rig was not going to hold up that he even called his wife to say goodbye for the final time, expressing how much he loved her and asking that she look after their children. 

They were saved when firefighters cut through the building's glass and pulled the men in to safety.

Weighing options: Firefighters considered numerous options at One World Trade Center (above), but eventually decided to cut through the glass

One World Trade Center, at 1,776 feet and 104 stories, is the tallest building in the Western hemisphere. 

It stands on the same spot the Twin Towers stood, and tenants just began moving in earlier this week. 

When reached for comment, a  woman who would not give her name said, 'We have no comment at this time,' before abruptly hanging up the phone.
