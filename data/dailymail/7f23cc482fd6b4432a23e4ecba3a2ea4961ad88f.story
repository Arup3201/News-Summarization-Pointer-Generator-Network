Men who can't function without an early morning coffee kick can now get it as they're having a shave.

A new product has added caffeine to normal shaving cream. It is absorbed by the skin – and an energy boost can be felt within five minutes, even before you've put your trousers on.

The effect of the product is thought to set in when a man uses the matching aftershave.

Men who normally head to the kitchen for a cup of coffee in the morning could now kick start their day in the bathroom, thanks to a new caffeinated shaving cream

An 85g bottle of the cream contains around 50mg of caffeine which is about the same level as a fizzy drink such as Coca Cola.

It also helps to reduce red patches and blemishes on the skin.

The bizarre cosmetic, dubbed the Caffeinated Shaving Cream, was invented by Stan Ades, 43, after he spotted the gap in the market.

Stan, who is from San Francisco, said: 'There is lots of innovation on things like razors but not that much for shaving creams.

'I saw that there was a gap in the market and I knew that caffeine is a vasoconstrictor and an antioxidant that helps reduce redness and keeps skin feeling healthy.

'I spoke to a chemist and we infused caffeine into a shaving cream and not only does it help the skin, but it is actually absorbed into the body.

'It probably wouldn't be as effective as a cup of coffee and is more like the effect given from a can of fizzy drink, but you can definitely feel it.

'There is about 50mg of caffeine in a bottle of the shaving cream and between 40 and 80mg in a cup of coffee.

'Although the shaving cream is made from caffeine derived from coffee beans it doesn't smell of coffee and instead has a peppermint oil scent.

'As it is just 85g it is a good size for travellers and can be taken on aeroplanes because it is within the flying restrictions.'

The shaving cream costs around five pounds from an online shop.
