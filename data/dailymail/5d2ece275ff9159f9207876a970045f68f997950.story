As Jubilee celebrations drew to a close the royal family were out in full force in London today, ensuring they were aptly dressed for the occasion.

While men sported classic three-piece suits to the morning service and carriage procession, each of the ladies chose to compliment their outfits with a matching hat.

The Queen kicked off proceedings in a Swarovski crystal-encrusted design by her long-serving in-house couturier Angela Kelly, while the Duchess of Cambridge impressed with a £790 feminine floral-inspired creation by milliner Jane Taylor.

However Zara Philips, 31, turned heads 
as she opted for a rather unusual piece of headgear from designer Karen 
Henriksen - even her husband Mike Tindall appeared to be a little 
bemused by the architectural accessory as they sat side-by-side in St 
Paul's Cathedral.

But it's not the first time the British monarch's eldest granddaughter has purchased wares from the London-based designer.

For the Duke of Edinburgh's 90th birthday at St George’s Chapel in 
Windsor last year she donned a simple, considerably flatter design.

Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who have
been berated for their choices of headwear in the past managed to get 
it right today - both selecting matching lavender-coloured berets from 
Stephen Jones.

Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall also looked magnificent in a cream Anna Valentine coat and dress with a broad-brimmed hat by Philip Treacy.

Lord Frederick's actress wife Sophie Winkleman (known as Lady Frederick Windsor since the two married in 2009), Zara Philips' sister-in-law Autumn and the Duchess of Kent, who doesn't normally attend royal events, were others to stand out thanks to their sartorial choices.

Jane Taylor, the London-based designer behind the Duchess of Cambridge's hat has already started marketing the beaded cocktail model, which took more than four weeks to create.
