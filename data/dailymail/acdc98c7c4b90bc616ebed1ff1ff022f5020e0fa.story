A dramatic cell phone video has captured the frightening moment champion race car driver Dario Franchitti crashed into the fence in the last lap of yesterday's IndyCar race, seriously injuring himself and hurting 13 spectators.

The 31 second clip, recorded by a race car fan from behind the stretch of fence Franchitti struck, shows the cars speeding around the track as onlookers cheered.

But, in a split-second, Franchitti's vehicle, at 100 mph, is shunted out of the way by another driver and goes airborne, slamming into the barricade, sending debris flying.

Horror: The 31 second clip, recorded by a race car fan from behind the stretch of fence Franchitti struck, shows the cars speeding around the track as onlookers cheered

The three-time Indianapolis 500 champion was airlifted to hospital after the horror crash, which occurred at the last corner of the last lap at the Houston race.

Scottish-born Franchitti was edged out of the way by Japanese driver Takuma Sato. When he struck the safety fencing, the car spun several times, firing rubble into the grandstands.

Franchitti was seen on television cameras to be moving in the aftermath of the crash as safety stewards dashed to offer assistance and his team owner Chip Ganassi said Franchitti was 'awake and alert' in the helicopter on the way to hospital and had injured his ankle and back.

It was later announced that despite 
suffering a fractured spine, broken ankle and concussion, the IndyCar 
champ will only be kept in hospital overnight for observation.

Scared: Spectators cower after the crash

Senior Captain Ruy Lozana of the Houston Fire Department said that two of the 13 spectators were sent to hospital while the rest were fine to be treated at the scene.

Franchitti was taken to a hospital near Reliant Park in Houston to be treated.

The Scotsman was stretchered off the track and taken by ambulance to the nearby Houston hospital.

Race officials said Franchitti was 'awake and alert' but did not initially go into details on his injuries.

His team owner Chip Ganassi revealed first that Franchitti had injured his ankle and back.

'He's talking,' said Ganassi, who rushed 
to the crash scene on a scooter. 'His ankle is a little sore, his back 
is a little sore. He is going to be OK.' 

Destroyed: Colliding at this speed, the cars are nothing more than mangled wrecks

The three-car smash happened in one of
the sharp turns and also involved Sato and E.J. Viso of 
Venezuela but both the drivers were able to leave their cars and walk 
away.

Debris from the crash also flew over the top of the safety fencing, injury some spectators.

Race officials did not immediately provide details of those injuries.

The race was won by Australia's Will Power.

The incident caused victory celebrations for Power to be muted as he hoped that Franchitti was alright.

'It just looked bad, I hate seeing that,' Power said. 'I just hope he's OK…But it was a very good day on the track.

Airlifted to hospital: Dario was stretched off the track and loaded into an ambulance before being airlifted to hospital, where he underwent surgery on his ankle

Before: Four-time IndyCar Series champion Dario Franchitti was rushed to hospital after a frightening crash during the final lap of the Houston Grand Prix on Saturday.

'We were able to help Helio out a bit in the championship, and I just hope Dario is alright.'

'Everybody hopes Dario is OK,' said New Zealand driver Scott Dixon.

Sato said that his car clipped the wall before triple-Indy 500 champion Franchitti's car collided with his.

'On the last lap I caught the marbles and brushed the wall and lost 
momentum,' Sato said to the LA Times. 'A couple cars passed me as I was off line and in 
Turn 5. I got very loose and Dario and I came together. Hopefully Dario 
is OK.'

In January, it was announced that Franchitti was splitting from actress Ashley Judd, his wife of 13-years.

The way they were: The actress was a regular fixture on the race car circuit as she supported her husband, seen here with their furry 'children' in May 2010 at the 94th Indianapolis 500 Trophy Presentation

The 44-year-old U.S. actress and the Scottish racing driver, 39, announced they were ending their marriage in a joint statement on Tuesday.

They told People.com at the time: 'We have mutually decided to end our marriage.

'We'll always be family and continue to cherish our relationship based on the special love, integrity, and respect we have always enjoyed.'

A spokesman for the actress subsequently confirmed the news to MailOnline when asked for comment, stressing their decision to split was a mutual one, not one-sided.

The Missing actress tied the knot in December 2001 in Scotland in a private ceremony.
