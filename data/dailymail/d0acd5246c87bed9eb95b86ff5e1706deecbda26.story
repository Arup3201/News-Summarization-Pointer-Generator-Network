Stylish in a pair of on-trend print trousers and a simple white t-shirt, Spain's Queen Letizia was every inch the chic holidaymaker as she arrived in Mallorca for a break with her husband King Felipe and two daughters.

Smiling broadly, the royal couple exchanged quips and smiles as they posed for pictures with their children, Leonor, Princess of Asturias, eight, and Infanta Sofia, seven, on the steps of the Marivient Palace in Palma de Mallorca.

The two little princesses, dressed in matching bright pink and mint green frocks, were initially bashful but soon joined their parents as they met well-wishers who had waited outside the palace to see them.

Traditional: The Spanish royals have made a habit of spending summer on the hugely popular Balearic island

While the infamous resort of Magaluf is less than 12 miles away, royal holidays on the Spanish party island of Mallorca tend to be more sedate.

Instead of lines of jager bombs and drunken fumbles on balconies, the Spanish royals spend most of the time on their yacht, Fortuna, and the rest enjoying private dinners or wandering through the winding streets of the pretty Mallorcan capital.

Although, unlike the Queen's summer residence Balmoral, the Marvient is publicly owned, the royals' Mallorcan holiday is considered family time and rarely do visiting heads of state get to see inside.

One group of visitors who did get to see inside, however, were the Prince of Wales and the late Princess Diana, who joined the Spanish royals for a holiday in Mallorca in 1988.

Like Queen Letizia and King Felipe, they joined former King Juan-Carlos and his wife Queen Sophia for photographs on the steps of the palace, along with their children - a three-year-old Prince Harry and a five-year-old William.

The British royals also spent time on Fortuna, with Prince Charles photographed teaching Harry how to swim under the watchful gaze of fellow guest, King Constantine of Greece.

While Queen Letizia and King Felipe won't be getting a visit from the British royals this summer, they will be spending time with their daughters and splashing around in the sea.

Although a visit to Magaluf is unlikely, the royal pair are expected to travel to other parts of the island with Pollença in the north and the wine-growing town of Felanitx among likely destinations.

Royal duties: After posing for photographs, the couple shook hands with waiting well-wishers and journalists

Happy family: The two young princesses were on their best behaviour as they met well-wishers

Family resemblance: The two princesses and their mother Queen Letizia closely resemble one another
