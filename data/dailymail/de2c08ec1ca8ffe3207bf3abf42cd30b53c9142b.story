International Women's Day represents the opportunity to celebrate the achievements of women and to be thankful for their positive contributions to daily life. 

Cesc Fabregas was certainly in the spirit of that message, with a romantic Instagram Post dedicated to his partner Daniella Semaan. 

The Chelsea midfielder is pictured pecking Semaan on the cheek and captions the snap cutely, 'Another year next to you...I love you so much.'

Fabregas announced in January that he was expecting his second child with Semaan

The long-term couple already have one child together and are expecting their second later this year. 

Fabregas is enjoying a productive first season back in the Premier League since returning to England, having joined Chelsea last summer from Barcelona in a £35 million move.  

The Spanish playmaker has scored four goals and made 18 assists in 36 appearances for the Blues so far this term.
