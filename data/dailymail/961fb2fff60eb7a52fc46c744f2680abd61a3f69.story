Three high school students have been accused of raping three freshman during a school-sponsored sports camp.

Galileo Mondol, 17, and two 16-year-old boys were charged Friday with raping three male freshmen during a sports camp sponsored by Somerville High School, where all six boys are students, according to reports. The school’s athletic department was made aware of the allegations Tuesday.

The two 16-year-olds have not been identified because they are minors.

Mondol and the two minors are alleged to have entered the cabin where the boys were sleeping an sexually assaulted them. All six males are members of the school’s soccer team, said reports.

‘These are terrible allegations. I’m disturbed and appalled that they may have happened,’ Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone said at a news conference Friday.’“Be clear on this, these allegations go far beyond hazing. This is rape.’

Curtatone volunteers for the coaching staff of the football team and was one of 24 adult chaperones at the camp, the Boston Herald reported. Each cabin had an adult chaperone inside, according to WHDH.

Mondol has been charged with aggrevated rape of a child under 16, indecent assault and battery, two counts of assault with intent to rape a child under 16 and three counts each of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and intimidation of a witness. The minors face similar charges.

‘In no way are these allegations a reflection on the team, our kids, [or] our community,’ Curtatone added.

Somerville High School, which sponsors the team-building retreat annually, was made aware of the charges Tuesday, according to WBZ. The students were arrested Friday.

‘All of us, frankly, are horrified at these allegations,’ school superintendent Tony Pierantozzi said at Friday’s news conference in Somerville with the mayor and other school officials. ‘We will ensure to the best of our ability that everyone and anyone who needs support will have it.’

Mondol is being held on a $100,000 bail, but his lawyer claims he’s innocent.

‘We will plead not guilty Tuesday because my client is not guilty,’ attorney William Korman said in a statement to the media. ‘He has absolutely no criminal history. He has never been in trouble before. We steadfastly maintain his innocence. His parents support him 100 per cent.’

A total of 165 student athletes attended the camp, 62 boy football players, 61 boy soccer players and 42 girl soccer players, with eight coaches per team as supervisors, according to Pierantozzi. The school has taken athletes to the camp for the past 15 years, and makes them sign no-hazing pledges before taking part in the three night trip, said Curtatone.

Curtatone stood by the students, praising their courage and pledging support.

‘[This incident] not define us… our spirit and character is defined by the courage shown by the victims and by the team. They have stood up and spoken out... and we will stand up with them and for them.’

All three suspects are currently in custody and will be arraigned on Tuesday, as courts are closed for the Labor Day holiday weekend.
