The 25-year-old put pen to paper on the new deal with the Reds which could be worth up to£150,000-a-week for the former Chelsea forward.

The club tweeted: '#LFC are delighted to confirm that Daniel Sturridge has committed his long-term future to the club #SturridgeLFC'.

Sturridge still had four years left on the terms that were agreed after his £12million arrival from Chelsea, but Liverpool have decided to reward his progress — he has scored 36 goals in 52 games — with a new contract, which would be heavily incentivised on his performances and run to the summer of 2019.

Speaking about his new deal, Sturridge told Liverpool's official website: 'It feels great. It's a big, big day in my life to commit to this club and to give the club my best years, which are ahead of me.

'I am thankful for the opportunity and that is the reason I committed my future. Everyone has been great with me, from the fans to the staff to the players, so it was an easy decision. I'm happy with how everything is going.'

The former Manchester City youngster is also confident that his bright start to life at Anfield is just the beginning in terms of goals and success.

He added: 'I may have had some good games and scored some goals, but literally this is the beginning in terms of what I can show. I don't feel I've shown really what I can do as a footballer.' 

The 25-year-old has scored 36 goals in 52 games since joining Liverpool in 2013

Sturridge took to Instagram to share his delight: 'We did it!! Proud to announce I've signed a new long term contract with Liverpool football club. I'm buzzing. 

'All the hard work has paid off but continues because there is nothing I want more than to life trophies and be successful with this club. Grateful to God for this opportunity. I want to thank the fans, players and the coaching staff. 

'My family have been there for me throughout my whole life and without them this wouldn't have been possible. Love you guys. It's an emotional day believe me. #redordead #LFC #lafamilia' 

The England international, who is currently at the centre of a club versus country row after being ruled out of the upcoming internationals, has been missing for the last month through injury.

It isn’t yet known whether the striker will be fit to face West Brom on Saturday.

Speaking recently, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers revealed that the club had been in discussions with Sturridge and his representatives with regards to the new contract.

‘Talks are ongoing with his representatives and there is nothing more to add,’ the manager said.

‘He has not trained with the team at all so it was not the right time for him to go [away with England].’
