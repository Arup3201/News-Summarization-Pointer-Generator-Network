Click here for what Sir Alex Ferguson had to say in his update book in defence of Hammers boss Sam Allardyce's style and how he asked for an explanation of what exactly is the West Ham way.

Sir Alex Ferguson comments on the 'West Ham way' in his updated autobiography  and calls the notion held dear by fans a myth.

He writes: 'I hope that before I die someone can explain the 'West Ham way'. 'What is it? They last won a trophy in 1980, the FA Cup.'

Sportsmail asked Sean Whetstone of West Ham fan website West Ham Till I Die for his reaction to Ferguson's comments and to meet the former Manchester United manager's request.

Sir Alex Ferguson's mocking of the 'West Ham way' is more about selling his book than it is supporting his old mate Sam Allardyce. 

He is being controversial for the sake of it to gain free publicity and to support his habit of buying expensive wine for his luxury cellar collection.

Fergie has a very short memory; the West Ham way was beating Manchester United 4-0 on a snowy December night in 2010 when Jonathan Spector and Carlton Cole were the unlikely heroes, scoring two goals apiece.

For me, the 'West Ham way' is about attacking football; going out to attack the opposition at all times, trying to score at every opportunity, never sitting back in an attempt to frustrate, but instead going for the jugular  regardless of whether you're home or away.

A fundamental part of the 'West Ham way' is central defenders bringing the ball out from the back. That started with Hammers and England legend Bobby Moore, and continued through Alvin Martin, Tony Gale, Slaven Bilic and Rio Ferdinand.

We also had attacking full backs who would overlap and get forward, best exemplified by John Bond, Noel Cantwell, Billy Bonds, Frank Lampard Senior, Julian Dicks and Ray Stewart.

The cavalier style of the 'West Ham way' made us vulnerable and is one of the reasons we used to concede so many goals - even with Bobby Moore in the centre of defence.

This season many West Ham fans will say the 'West Ham way' has returned. New signings Aaron Cresswell, Carl Jenkinson, Diafra Sakho, Enner Valencia, Alex Song, Morgan Amalfitano and Cheikhou Kouyate have added a dimension we have lacked in recent seasons under  Allardyce.

This new injection of pace, skill and quality, together with excellent form of Stewart Downing and Mark Noble, has made West Ham a joy to watch again and is a major reason why we are fourth in the Premier League.

But the West Ham way is not all about results. As Hammers we enjoyed the hard-fought 2-2 draw at Hull City and the narrow 2-1 defeat at Old Trafford.

In both those matches we gave it a go and tried our best. No false nines or 11 men behind the ball - we went for it - and that is what we will expect on Saturday lunchtime as we face second-placed Manchester City at home.

The West Ham way is fundamental to the club's identity.

Former West Ham and England manager Ron Greenwood eloquently explained the West Ham way in 1977 when he said: 'The crowds at West Ham haven't been rewarded by results but keep turning up because of the good football they see.

Ferguson pointed out that West Ham's last major trophy came in 1980, when they won the FA Cup

'Other clubs will suffer from the old bugbear that results count more than anything. This has been the ruination of English football.'

I am happy to give Fergie an explanation of the West Ham way!

Maybe now he will concentrate more on the mess he left behind at Manchester United when he retired and leave the comments about West Ham and their style of play out of further updates of his book.
