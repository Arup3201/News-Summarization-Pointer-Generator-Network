Forget the crisis in A&E, GPs refusing to work out of hours or the need to save billions from the NHS budget.

Health ministers have declared war on an unlikely enemy: the builder’s bum.

In a bizarre attempt to nanny the nation’s construction workers, the government has ordered them to ‘say bye bye to baring bottoms’.

Target: The new public health minister has made targeting builders' bums the first priority of her job

Getting builders ‘into shape’ is the first priority unveiled by new health minister Jane Ellison.

Critics immediately branded the plan ‘absolutely ridiculous’ and warned ministers to stop ‘sticking their noses into how people decide to live their lives’.

Labour said ministers should focus on 'the cracks in the NHS instead'.

The Department for Health has even enlisted TV presenter Tommy Walsh – dubbed ‘Britain’s favourite builder’ – to front the campaign to improve the health of bricklayers, carpenters and plumbers.

‘The image of the bottom baring, overweight builder is being replaced by workers who are hands-on well-oiled machines who operate building sites up and down the country,’ a press release said.

‘To build on this, today’s new pledge outlines how the construction industry will further help its workforce to lead healthier lives.’

Message: Public Health Minister Jane Ellison joined TV presenter Tommy Walsh (right) and two builders on a construction site to launch the campaign

Construction firms are being told 
organise regular health checks for staff, offer stop-smoking clubs and 
provide healthier staff canteens.

Miss
 Ellison, appointed Public Health minister in this week’s reshuffle, 
said: ‘The construction industry is a vital part of the UK economy and 
it is important we do all that we can to sustain a healthy workforce.

‘Builders often work in difficult and demanding environments and we must support them to ensure their health is not put at risk.

'It’s great that so many firms are making the health of their staff a priority on their sites.'

TV builder Walsh said: 'As a builder I’ve seen attitudes towards health in the trade massively improve since I first picked up a trowel.

'Today’s builders are just as likely to go down to the gym as they are to go to the pub after work.

'But there’s loads more that workers and their companies can do, so I want every construction firm in Britain to sign up to the pledge and promise to do their bit to make building sites healthier places to work.'

But a Labour source said: 'Days into the 
new job, the Minister should concern herself with the cracks in the NHS 
instead. David Cameron's left A&Es in crisis and hospitals without 
enough staff.

'You couldn't make it up. Minsters need to get their priorities sorted.'

Campaign: The government has enlisted builder and TV presenter Tommy Walsh to front the drive to lecture construction workers about their health

In total 34 companies signed up to a Responsibility Deal Construction Pledge to encourage their staff to adopt healthier lifestyles.

But Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘It’s absolutely ridiculous that the Government are once again sticking their noses into how people decide to live their lives with this condescending campaign.

‘Of course it’s important people are fit and health especially when they are doing physical work, but this is the Nanny State gone mad.

‘Ministers should focus on cutting wasteful spending in the NHS rather than worrying about what builders are eating for breakfast.’
