Landlords in one of Britain's poorest areas are exploiting vulnerable families by building tiny 'sheds with beds' in back gardens to house them in.

Newham Council in East London has handed out 42 enforcement notices to slum property owners since September 2011, with the growing problem especially bad in the borough.

The wretched backyard and garden sheds, described as ‘little bigger than rabbit hutches’, have been described as dragging London back to the notorious Victorian slum tenements of the 19th century.

More and more desperate migrant families have been forced to set up home in cramped wooden sheds crammed into small gardens, which are being rented out by unscrupulous private landlords.

They are ruthlessly exploiting a housing crisis and often charging hundreds of pounds a month for the dilapidated huts. Many shed homes have appeared in East Ham, Newham and Forest Gate.

Newham Council released pictures last week of a slum on Katharine Road in Forest Gate and another of Tower Hamlets Road in Forest Gate - occupied until recently by a middle-aged man.

In some recent cases, enforcement notices were issued ordering the owners to take down the illegal buildings. They complied and dismantled them after being threatened with direct action.

The council would have otherwise sent 
their own contractors to take down the sheds before sending the bill to 
the owner. Each such operation usually costs about £1,000.

Newham Council has vowed to deal with 
more shacks this year. Officials are acting. after a property licensing 
scheme came into effect last month, in a huge effort to regulate all 
private landlords.

'There are good landlords in Newham and we want to work with them. Unfortunately, there are also some unscrupulous ones - and we are going after them vigorously and robustly'

Newham Mayor Sir Robin Wales

Newham Mayor Sir Robin Wales said: ‘We want to ensure that private sector rented properties are well managed and meet a good standard. We also want to deal with the crime and anti-social behaviour that is associated with bad private sector rented housing.

'There are good landlords in Newham and we want to work with them. Unfortunately there are also some unscrupulous ones - and we are going after them vigorously and robustly.

'We will never accept private sector tenants being directly exploited by landlords who force them to live in dangerous and unacceptable conditions. One bad house can drag down a whole street.'

Two years ago MailOnline reported on an Indian father of three who was among thousands of illegal immigrants renting sheds from rogue landlords across London suburbs and the Home Counties.

Row after row of terraced Thirties houses in Southall, a predominantly Asian area of west London, had outhouses and garages transformed into makeshift bedsits barely big enough to lie down in. 

In some, bare electric wires trailed dangerously from extension cables alongside rubber piping carrying cold water from the main house. There were camp beds and inflatable mattresses in others.

Some of them also had conversions carried out more professionally - with tiny kitchens and bathrooms complete with running hot water, gas central heating and mini-cookers.

Hell on earth: Poverty in a Victorian London slum

The most notorious slum of London's Victorian East End was Old Nichol in Bethnal Green - known for its filthy and narrow streets surrounded by overcrowded tenement buildings and the carcasses of dead animals.

The area was dull and grey, blocking out all light, and many houses were prone to flooding because they were below ground level. Broken window panes were often blocked up with newspapers and hats in the winter.

In Sarah Wise’s 2008 book The Blackest Streets, she said the area’s 30 or so streets housed around 5,700 people and had a death rate that was almost double that of neighbouring areas.

A quarter of all children born in the Nichol died before their first birthday and Old Nichol Street itself was described by the local medical officer, Dr Bate, as being unfit for human habitation.

Damp, overcrowding and bad air were all problems. But in 1887, five out of every six infants to die in Bethnal Green homes where the whole family shared a bed had suffocated.

Coroners attributed most deaths to 'overlaying', when a sleeping parent or sibling rolled onto the infant, but others suspected that many were intentionally suffocated by desperately poor mothers.
