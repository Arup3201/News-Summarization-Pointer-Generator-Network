Two years ago, aged 18, Tom Pyle made an impulsive decision that has cast a shadow over his life ever since.

On a whim he had a large tattoo inked onto his chest depicting two women's faces - one of them with skull-like features - with the wording: 'We must let go of the life we have planned so to accept the life that is waiting for us' scrawled between them.

His shocked and devastated parents tried for months to convince him to have the design removed but it was only the negative reaction of his peers on a holiday that finally convinced him to begin laser treatment.

Before: Tom had the  tattoo depicting two women, one of whom appears mutilated, with the wording 'We must let go of the life we have planned so to accept the life that is waiting for us' in between them done on a whim

After: Tom is over half way through a course of intensive laser treatments to remove the massive tattoo 

When Tom first expressed a desire to have a tattoo his parents Dave and Janet, from Sandhurst, Berkshire, were strongly against the notion.

His mother Janet, 54, said: 'We told him there will come a point where you will regret it.'

But despite discussing with Tom at length the permanence of a tattoo he had small designs inked both on his ribs and both his ankles. 

However, it was his third trip to the tattoo parlor where things went badly wrong.

Janet only discovered her son had been inked with the massive design across his chest when she stumbled across a picture he had posted on Facebook.

'My first thought was "oh my God, they are absolutely awful",' she explained.

'We didn't understand why he would have chosen that image as it is so at odds with the Tom we know.

Tom admits he didn't put much thought into the design, which he initially wanted smaller 

'It was grotesque. I found it disturbing and offensive as well as derogatory to women. One of the women looked like she had been mutilated.

'He is a caring, emotional boy who cares about what people think, and just so different from the image that tattoo portrayed.

'The quote suggested he had had a bad life, when in actual fact he has led a good, happy life. He was born so perfect and to me, now, I felt he was scarred, that he had destroyed his body.

'We were absolutely devastated. I cried constantly for about two weeks. I just couldn't bare to look at it and see what he had done.'

It wasn't until he went on a summer holiday with his friends that Tom realised the impact of what he had done

And despite his outward bravado, Tom admits that he had his doubts about the tattoo almost as soon as it was finished.

'I had just strolled into the tattoo parlour and I saw a design and just picked it. There was no real thought involved.

'I initially wanted it smaller but they said it wouldn't be possible and I was so eager to have it done I just went with it.

'At the time all my friends were getting tattooed and I thought it was the 'thing' to do. We were all about to go on a lads holiday and we all wanted to be inked for the beach. 

'The moment I walked out I was gutted. I was think "what on earth have I done".

'But obviously I had to pretend I was fine with it.'

Although Janet and Dave begged their son to get the tattoo removed he insisted he like it and refused, despite his mothers obvious anguish.

It wasn't until he went on a summer holiday with his friends that Tom realised the impact of what he had done.

'I got completely the opposite reaction of what I had expected on the beach. People were actually coming up to me and being like "what the hell is that on your chest?"' Tom explained. 

Receiving an increasingly negative reaction Tom began to come round to the idea of removing the tattoo, much to his mother's joy.

'I was overjoyed when he said he wanted it lasered. Just over the moon,' she said.

However, Tom still had to undergo the agonizing removal procedure.

Speaking of the Cynosure's PicoSure tattoo removal treatment sessions, which he is still undergoing at a leading London tattoo removal studio, The Reset Room, Tom, now 21, said: ''I can't decribe it, it is the worse pain I've ever experienced. 

'It is like a red hot elastic band being pinged against you over and over and I could smell my own skin burning.

But despite the pain of the treatments, Tom and mum Janet are delighted with the results, although Tom will still need several more sessions to fully remove the tattoo completely. 

'The guy before my first treatment was a rugby player and passed out; but the pain is better than the tattoo,' he said.

'I felt really happy after my first treatment and am becoming even more determined to get rid of them as quickly as possible. I definitely won't be getting another.'

When asked what advice he would give someone considering a tattoo Tom says: 'I'm definitely not against them all together. But I would definitely say think about it.

'Someone told me, put the design up on your wall for a year or two. If you still like it after that then you're probably ok.'
