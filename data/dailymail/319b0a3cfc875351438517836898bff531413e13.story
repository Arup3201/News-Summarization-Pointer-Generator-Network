The Nazis were investigating how to use mosquitos as biological weapons, recently discovered documents reveal.

SS-chief Heinrich Himmler’s entomological institute at Dachau concentration camp investigated whether malaria-infected mosquitos could survive transport into enemy territory.

The institute, set up by Himmler in 1942, conducted trials of different types of mosquitoes to find which could be kept alive long enough to ‘transport’ malaria from the lab to Allied troops.

Nazi's bio war: SS-chief Heinrich Himmler's entomological institute at Dachau conducted trials of different types of mosquitoes to find which could be kept alive long enough to spread malaria to Allied troops

The institute’s official mission was 
to conduct research into insect-transmitted diseases, such as typhoid, 
but according to a recent article, it also investigated potential ways 
of conducting biological warfare

In
 1944, the director of the institute recommended a particular type of 
anopheles mosquito known for its capacity to transmit malaria to humans,
 according to an article in science journal Endeavour.

Due
 to Germany having signed up to the 1925 Geneva protocol, use of 
biological weapons was forbidden and as a result, the ‘mosquito malaria 
project’ had to remain secret.

The
 project was ‘a bizarre mix of Himmler's smattering of scientific 
knowledge, personal paranoia, an esoteric world view, and genuine 
concerns about his SS troops’, the article’s author Klaus Reinhardt told
 Süddeutsche Zeitung.

The idea of attacking Nazi enemies with malaria was not the only unconventional idea investigated by Himmler.

Evil plans: The 'mosquito project' was carried out in secret, by scientists at Himmler's Dachau concentration camp, and proof of the experiments has only emerged in modern times

As Hitler, pictured with Himmler, had signed the 1925 Geneva protocol the 'mosquito malaria project' had to be conducted in secret at Dachau

According to a 2010 book, Himmler believed he would be able to manufacture gold.

An alchemist named Karl Malchus convinced Himmler that he could make gold from stones, soil and even paraffin.

He
 was installed at another secret unit at Dachau, and it allegedly took 
several weeks before Himmler realised he had been conned.

'Operation
 Munchkin' was another one of the SS chief's plans, one which involved 
breeding giant Angora rabbits in concentration camps to provide 
fur-lined clothing for Hitler's armed forces.

While
 prisoners were starved, beaten and tortured to death in Auschwitz, 
Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen and Dachau, thousands of rabbits were kept in 
hutches in these and 27 other camps.

The
 rabbits were treated eons better than the prisoners of the camps, and 
according to Himmler's notes the population grew from 6,500 in 1941 to 
25,000 in 1943.

However, as the Allies began to move in on Nazi Germany, Himmler's 'pet project' was stopped.
