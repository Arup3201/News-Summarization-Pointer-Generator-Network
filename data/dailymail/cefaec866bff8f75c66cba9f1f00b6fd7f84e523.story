A mother is suing her disabled daughter's carers after her wheelchair rolled 200ft down a steep hill and crashed into a main road.

Lisa Conisbee, 27, who suffers from cerebral palsy, received horrific facial injuries after her chair rolled down the hill before hitting a kerb and throwing her into the road.

Two carers had pushed her to the top of Skinners Hill, in Rushden, Northamptonshire, where they waited for a bus while out on a day trip.

It is believed the brakes on her wheelchair may not have been applied as they were waiting, allowing it to roll down the steep incline.

Her mother Penny Nadal, 53, is now taking legal action against Olympus Care Services - claiming her daughter’s carers forgot to apply the brakes to the wheelchair.

Ms Conisbee - who was left with a scar above her eye and several cuts and bruises to her face - took two months to recover after the fall on April 23 last year.

Yesterday, her teaching assistant mother said her daughter, who also suffers from spinal problems, epilepsy and partial blindness, was 'lucky to be alive'.

She said: 'To say I am absolutely appalled and angry is an understatement.

'My daughter was placed in the carers’ hands to be looked after and you have to have an understanding of trust.

'I feel betrayed that this has happened to Lisa and just want to understand exactly how it could happen.

'My daughter has suffered her whole life and this will leave a lasting mental scar.

'Trust has to be earned with my daughter and she always felt safe in her wheelchair but this incident has left her traumatised.

'If a vehicle had been coming the other way she could have been killed.

'I don’t believe the brakes could have been applied, otherwise she would never have rolled down the hill.

'Since the accident she has been very quiet and subdued and is nowhere near as happy as she used to be.

'She has even said things like "don’t let them tip me out" when getting in her wheelchair. 

'It is just awful. I just think that somebody has to be held accountable.'

Ms Conisbee lives with other people in a specially adapted bungalow in Wellingborough with 24-hour care.

Ms Nadal, who has two other daughters Kerry, 29, and Leanne, 22, lives nearby with her husband Marc, 56.

Olympus Care Services - which is owned and run solely by Northamptonshire County Council - has denied liability.

Specialist law firm Irwin Mitchell are 
now investigating allegations the carers left Ms Conisbee unattended 
without the brakes on.

Personal injury lawyer Sophie Davies 
said: 'This is a truly shocking incident and if Lisa’s wheelchair had 
collided with oncoming traffic we could be talking about an entirely 
different outcome.

Two carers had wheeled her to the top of Skinners Hill (pictured), in Rushden, Northamptonshire, where they waited for a bus while out on a day trip

'Lisa has suffered enough through life as she has battled through various disabilities and learning difficulties.

'The family put their trust in the care providers to ensure Lisa could have a safe and fun day out but sadly it seems as though this was not the case.

'The worst part of this for Lisa is the psychological outcome rather than the physical injuries.

Olympus Care Services - which is owned and run solely by Northamptonshire County Council - has denied liability and an investigation is currently ongoing

'To Lisa her wheelchair is a safe place to be and in her mind carers are safe people to be with, but this trust has been shattered and she is forced into yet another setback in her life.

'We need to investigate why Lisa was left unattended and why she was allowed to roll down a slope.'

A spokesman for Olympus Care Services said: 'For legal reasons we are unable to comment on this particular case, however, we take any matters of safeguarding extremely seriously and ensure that all incidents are investigated thoroughly and independently.'
