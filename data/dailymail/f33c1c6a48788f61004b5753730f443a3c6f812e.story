A Chinese restaurant in Kenya that barred black customers from entering after 5pm has been shut down. 

The owners of the Chongqing Chinese in Nairobi only let taxi drivers or Africans accompanied by Chinese, European or Indian patrons in to eat.

They have now been summoned before authorities after it emerged they did not have the proper licence.

A Chinese restaurant in Nairobi,  which barred black customers after 5pm, has been shut down with its owners summoned before authorities

The restaurant's rule was brought into place after a robbery in 2013 and was not meant to cause offence, the owners said.

'We don't admit Africans that we don't know because you never know who is Al-Shabaab and who isn't,' restaurant relations manager Esther Zhao told the Daily Nation. 

But Otiende Amollo, the Ombudsman, said it was both illegal and unconstitutional to discriminate against an individual on the grounds of their race, gender or ethnicity.

He said: 'That amounts to racial and ethnic profiling, which is unconstitutional.

'It has in it the inherent assumption that Africans are inevitably pre-disposed to be robbers.'  

Residents took to social media to express their anger at being banned from the Chinese using the hashtags #RacistRestaurant, #NoBlacksHere and #TheChineseInvasion. 

One user Anita Munyasya tweeted: 'Soon we'll be banned from our own country... #RacistRestaurant' 

Another with the name @kaytrixx wrote: 'It's like a visitor at your house ordered you to go and eat in the loo instead of dining table (sic). Who owns the house? #NoBlacksHere' 

And one known just as Ken added: 'Discrimination of any kind is evil may it be based on RACE, ETHNICITY, TRIBE, RELIGION, OPINION or otherwise. #NoBlacksHere'

One Kenyan MP even asked the Parliamentary Committee on Security to carry out its own investigation.

Nairobi governor Evans Kidero said the restaurant was shut because it did not have the proper licences.

He said: 'We have established that the restaurant did not have the licences and I have ordered it closed until the management complies.

'The owners of the restaurant have no change of user from residential to commercial which is a requirement to operate a business in Nairobi. 

'As of now the restaurant will remain closed until they comply with all set rules and regulations. We have deployed security officers around the premises.'

But he added: 'All business and service providers must ensure that all customers and clients are treated with respect and dignity, irrespective of race, colour, sex, tribe and religion.' 

China's relationship with Kenya and much of Africa has been seen as being at an all-time high - notably with huge investments in major infrastructure projects.

Up to two million Chinese people have moved to Africa in the last 15 years.
