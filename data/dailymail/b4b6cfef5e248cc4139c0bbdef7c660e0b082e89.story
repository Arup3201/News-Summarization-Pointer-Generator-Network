Dr Stephen Frost (pictured) is claiming substantial damages in a whistleblowing claim against the Ministry of Defence

A highly-experienced doctor was sacked by text while on a family holiday after blowing the whistle on a suspected drugs scam at a British Army base.

Dr Stephen Frost, who led the campaign for an inquest into the controversial death of Iraq weapons expert Dr David Kelly, was dismissed by the Ministry of Defence after calling for a police investigation.

He claims there was a ‘cover-up of criminality’ over the ordering and dispensing of 2,400mg of dangerous controlled drug morphine sulphate for a patient, instead of 400mg.

The incident happened before Dr Frost started work at the military camp’s medical centre.

But less than a month after telling bosses he believed a crime had taken place, he was sacked by text and email while on holiday in North Wales.

Now the doctor, whose ordeal has left him suffering stress, anxiety and depression, has won a legal battle to bring a whistleblowing claim against the MoD.

He is claiming substantial damages that could run into hundreds of thousands of pounds.

The Mail has long campaigned for the protection of public sector whistleblowers and has revealed how senior NHS doctors have been gagged by their hospitals when highlighting wrong-doing.

Last night Dr Frost said: ‘It is a great relief that the judge has allowed my claim to proceed.

‘I have dedicated much of my life to working as a doctor for the Armed Forces and I took my job of treating sick and injured military personnel very seriously.

‘My summary dismissal came as a great shock to me and has seriously affected my health and my family life.’

Shah Qureshi, Dr Frost’s solicitor and one of the country’s leading specialists in employment law, said: ‘Dr Frost believes he was summarily dismissed because he shone a spotlight on potential criminality at a military barracks.

‘Other members of staff involved continue to work for the MOD while my client has lost his livelihood. To this day it is unclear as to whether the matter was ever referred to the police.’

Mr Qureshi said it was of ‘great concern’ the MoD had fought to get the case struck out on a technicality. ‘It is of immense public importance that whistleblowers enjoy maximum protection before the law,’ he said.

Dr Frost, a civilian doctor who had worked for the MoD for nearly 20 years, was employed on a six-month contract at Weeton Barracks, near Blackpool, Lancashire, when his ordeal began.

In August 2013 – two weeks after he started the job – he was told a pharmacy technician had, a month earlier, mistakenly ordered and dispensed 40 60mg tablets of morphine sulphate, instead of 10mg pills.

Dr Frost checked with the patient who insisted the lower strength drugs had been handed out – leading the doctor to conclude the stronger tablets were missing.

He believed it was ‘highly unlikely’ the experienced pharmacy technician would have ordered and dispensed the 60mg tablets by mistake and concluded she may have been forced into some form of criminal activity.

Suspecting foul play, Dr Frost expressed his concern to members of the practice team and a nurse-led internal investigation and said the matter was so serious the police should be informed.

Documents handed to the tribunal said: ‘He considered a police investigation was required because it was likely a criminal offence (blackmail, coercion or threats) had taken place to procure controlled drug.’

On September 6, 2013, while climbing a mountain on holiday, Dr Frost received a text and email out of the blue informing him his contract had been terminated. He was later informed he was barred from working on another military base.

He was not told why he had been sacked nor given a chance to defend himself. He maintains he was unlawfully dismissed for whistleblowing about a possible drugs racket.

The MoD disputed Dr Frost’s case claiming it did not employ him but only hired him through a health recruitment agency, despite the fact he had worked almost exclusively for the military since 1996.

Defence chiefs also sought to strike out the claim on a technicality arguing he was not a whistleblower.

Throwing out the MoD’s case at a pre-tribunal hearing, Employment Judge Rebecca Howard said: ‘The basis of the claim is that following Dr Frost's participation in the investigation into incorrect dosage and dispensation of morphine he was summarily dismissed and banned from working as a doctor in the military.’

Dr Frost led a campaign for a full inquest into Dr Kelly's death in woods near to his Oxfordshire home and a review of the investigation by Thames Valley Police.

The chemical and biological weapons expert was found dead in July 2003, shortly after being exposed as the source of a BBC claim that Tony Blair's Government had 'sexed up' the case for war in Iraq.

The Hutton Report later found that Dr Kelly, a member of a UN inspection team sent to Iraq to unearth weapons of mass destruction, had committed suicide. However, many still believe the 59-year-old scientist may have been murdered by the security services.

No inquest has ever been held.

A spokeswoman for Lancashire Police said the force had not been involved in any investigation at Weeton.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘This case is subject to legal proceedings and it would be inappropriate for us to comment.’
