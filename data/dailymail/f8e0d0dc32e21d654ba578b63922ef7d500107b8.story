Ohio kidnap victim Michelle Knight was removed from the missing person's database just 15 months after she was reported missing in 2002, it emerged today.

Police removed her name after repeated attempts to contact her mother to verify the-then 22-year-old was still missing failed.

Barbara Knight said that police did not do enough to try and find her daughter and did not give it the same attention as Amanda Berry's case or Gina DeJesus because they thought she was a runaway.

The police department's policy on 
investigating missing adults at the time states that an officer must go 
and see if a missing person has been found, then inform the FBI within 
two hours so the person can be removed from the National Crime Information Center database.

Kym Pasqualini, a national advocate 
for missing adults, told The Plain Dealer that the removal of Knight's 
name and description from the database helped the case fall through the 
cracks.

However, even after she was removed 
from the database, police reports show that officers continued to 
inquire about her whereabouts several times afterwards and successfully 
verified she was still missing in May 2003 after finally reaching her 
mother.

Concern: Michelle Knight's great-aunt Deborah Knight says that her niece had a child as a result of the junior high sex attack

On Wednesday, two days after their 
escape from the house on Seymour Avenue, DeJesus and Berry were released
from the hospital and reunited with their families.

Knight remains in the hospital.

It also emerged yesterday that 
Michelle was gang-raped and impregnated in junior high - a year before 
she suffered more than ten years of abuse under a kidnapper.

Her great-aunt told the New York Daily News on Thursday that three male classmates grabbed Michelle at school and raped her.

Deborah Knight told the paper that if
that wasn't enough of a hardship, she later found out that she was 
pregnant as a result of that attack - and later had a son she named 
Joey.

The boy was placed in foster care shortly after he was born.

Her twin brother Freddie told the paper that when he saw his long-lost sister, she asked him for a hug.

He added: 'She was so freaking happy.
I gave her a hug, but I couldn’t give her a bear hug because of all the
things that happened to her.'

Relatives told the Daily News that she is looking forward to being reunited with her son, now 13, after she leaves the hospital.

It was revealed earlier this week that Michelle is reportedly suffering hearing loss and facial bone damage after years of vicious beatings to her head.

Her mother Barbara, 50, said she never gave up 
hope and will
now be able to introduce Michelle to the half sister she has never met, 
10-year-old Katie, who was born after she disappeared.

On Wednesday, Barbara told to the Today show about how she had never given up hope that her daughter was alive - but that she was led to believe the woman, then in her 20s, had fled.

'Certain people said she didn't want 
nothing to do with me but still in my heart I thought no, because I knew
my Michelle,' she said. 'They figured she just left because of 
the baby and everything.

Troubled: She told Savannah Guthrie some people told her Michelle had wanted nothing to do with her

'[Police] told me if she breaks the law or they spot her, they'll let me know - but nothing happened.'

Barbara, who said she filed a missing persons report after Michelle vanished and continued to search for her, said her sons have been reunited with Michelle but she has not yet seen her.

'I just wish that my daughter would reach out and let me know that she's there... She's probably angry at the world because she thought she would never be found but thank God that somebody did,' she said.

'I don't want her to think that I forgot about her... Hopefully whatever happened between us, if something did - I hope it heals because I really want to take her back to Florida with me.'

But Barbara said that she knew little about what had happened to Michelle since she last saw her as she has not spoken with detectives, she said.

'There was a detective who called me but he just said it was my daughter,' she said, adding that she missed his call and that he had left work when she called back. 'I didn't get a hold of anyone.'

Instead, she only knows the details from watching news reports.

While
the stories of missing Cleveland girls Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry, who were also found on Monday, 
have remained high-profile cases over the last decade, little was known 
of Michelle.

While
family appeals for Gina and Amanda have been frequent and 
well-publicized over the past ten years, her case appears to have been 
long forgotten.

Michelle was in her early twenties when she
was last seen on August 23, 2002, at her cousin's house near West 106th
Street and Lorain Avenue.

Mrs
Knight said she would often put up fliers around Cleveland's West Side 
and even after moving away she would return to continue the search on 
her own as police were little help.

Found: The women were found at this home in Cleveland on Monday after Berry managed to escape

Barbara Knight previously told The 
Plain Dealer that Michelle vanished shortly after she was scheduled for a
court appearance in the custody case of her son.

The mother told the paper that she had become involved with an abusive man whom she thinks injured her toddler grandson, eventually leading Michelle to lose the boy.

Mrs Knight told The Plain Dealer she 
believes she once saw her daughter walking with an older man at a 
shopping mall several years ago.

When the woman trailed behind her companion, he would grab her by the arm and pull her along, she said.
