Tragedy:  Clare Munro, 47, died from 'serious injuries' in her home in Cheshire

A 47-year-old mother-of-three has died from 'serious injuries', believed to have been sustained in her home in a leafy Cheshire village.

Police have launched a murder investigation after the body of Clare Munro was found in a property in Culcheth, north-east of Warrington, shortly before 3pm on Sunday.

The death of Ms Munro, a childminder, has shocked the quiet village, where neighbours described her house as 'a hub for the local community'.

A 50-year-old man is currently being held in custody on suspicion of murder while the address on the quiet suburban street remains cordoned off by police. 

Today, shocked neighbours paid tribute to the mother-of-three and described her as being well known and instrumental to the local community.

Geoff Pickin, 69, who has lived in the street for 17 years, said: 'I was on the phone when I saw a load of police cars turn up.

'All in all there were nine police cars and three ambulances.

'The next thing a man was being taken out of the house in handcuffs.

'Clare's daughter came out of the house with police and it looked like she had blood on her shirt - it was horrific.

'It must have been a terrifying experience for the children.

'Clare was a very nice and pleasant lady - I'd often see her walking up and down the street.

'She was a child minder and did a lot of dog walking so there was always a lot of people with her.

'I've lived here for 17 years and I've never seen anything like this - it's the most shocking thing I've seen in all my life.'

A spokesman for Cheshire Police said officers were called to the address shortly before 3pm on Sunday.

Mrs Munro was alive when police arrived, but had sustained serious injuries and died at the scene.

The spokesman said Cheshire Police have launched a murder investigation and that a 50-year-old man remains in custody in connection with the investigation.

Mrs Munro is believed to have shared her home with her three children. It is not known if her husband lived at the address.

A tribute card reads: 'Darling Clare, Just can't or don't know what to say or write. You were the best person in the world and a great friend'

Frank Lloyd, 74, who has lived in the street for 32 years, said: 'They were a very popular family and Clare always had a smile on her face.

'Clare was a lovely lady and very well known in the local area she did a lot of dog walking, we used to talk to them a lot.

'They have arranged a lot of community events since they moved here around 10 years ago and everyone spoke highly of her and husband.

'And they were instrumental in organising a community party for the diamond jubilee in June 2012.

'It is a very quiet area and this is a desirable street to live on. You don't expect something like this happen in an area like this.

'Clare's house was a hub for the local community - she will be sorely missed by everyone that knew her.

'We don't know anything about what happened. We returned home from London and saw the street full of police cars yesterday afternoon.

'It is the last thing you expect to come home to.'
