It is believed that the pilot and passenger were a couple.

Officers from Mudgee Local Area Command attended the scene where they located a man, deceased inside the single-engine two-seater plane.

The pilot who was in his 60s died on impact while the only passenger, a woman died on the scene as paramedics attempted to revive her.

A crime scene has been established at the airport and will be examined.

The  Australian Transport Safety Bureau and forensic officers joined a Police investigation.

Stuart Godley from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau told ABC News that police will guard the site overnight and two investigators will arrive there tomorrow morning.

'We don't really know what's happened at this stage,' he said.

'All we know is that it is a small single engine aircraft, it's a Vans RV-6 and it's amateur built.

'That means it's been built by the owner, most likely the pilot.'

A report will also be prepared for the information of the Coroner.
