The parents of a toddler who lost both legs and an arm to meningitis are battling for a new vaccine to be introduced across the UK.

Tommy Brown contracted the deadly disease at just five months old. He was given just a five per cent chance of survival after also developing blood poisoning and his heart stopping, meaning doctors had to bring him back from the dead.

Now, a year after their ordeal, Tommy's parents Julie and Dean are campaigning for a revolutionary new meningitis vaccine to be made available to children across the NHS.

Fourteen-month-old Tommy Brown (with mother Julie, father Dean and sister Ellie) contracted meningitis B at just five months old. He lost both legs, his right arm and the fingers of his left hand and was given just a five per cent chance of survival

Ms Tuckey, 37, said: 'Injuries and all, we prayed Tommy would live. It makes me cry to see him alert and looking about, then looking at where his hands and legs used to be, as if he is wondering where they are.

'It was so painful to see him suffer and go through the operations. But he is remarkable and is superb at adapting, we're lucky to still have our beautiful boy.'

The ordeal began when mother-of-four Ms Tuckey, 37, and Tommy's father, Dean Brown, 28, saw their son's temperature skyrocket to over 37C.

They took Tommy to his doctor, but his temperature continued to rise and he was eventually diagnosed with a throat infection.

But by the morning, the youngster had a purple rash across his body and was rushed to Walsall Manor Hospital, where meningitis and septicaemia were finally diagnosed. Doctors also had to revive him as he technically died in A&E.

The family is backing a campaign for a new vaccine to be introduced across the UK. It will protect against meningitis B, the most deadly form that Tommy had

Tommy's parents were then shocked to be told that he would have to lose one of his legs between the knee and ankle.

But, after a five-hour operation, he had to have both legs, right hand and left hand fingers amputated in March 2012, followed by painful skin grafts.

Ms Tuckey, who has three other children, Elle, 10; Demi, 18 and Lee, 19, said: 'It was a nightmare. I didn't go home for six weeks, I suffered bad dreams every night and spoke to a psychologist to help me cope with things.

'It was hard to see our clever boy, who was starting to move around in his walker, learn to cope without his limbs.

'But we know he will do us proud and achieve whatever he puts his mind to.'

He was also dubbed 'the miracle boy'
as the hospital told his parents 'we've never known a child so poorly 
survive so many amputations, so young'.

Marvel: Tommy was dubbed 'the miracle boy' by hospital. His mother Julie said: 'We were told the staff had never known a child so poorly survive so many amputations, so young'

Tommy is now learning to walk using his new prosthetic 
legs and can even kick a football.

The
family are now assisting with the Meningitis UK and Meningitis Trust's 
new national Meningitis B: Beat it Now roadshow and petition.

The
UK has one of the highest Meningitis B incidence rates in the world, 
affecting an average of 1,870 people each year. Meningitis B is the most
deadly form of the condition.

One in 10 people affected will die and 
one in four will be left with life-changing after-effects such as brain 
damage or limb loss.

Developed by pharmaceutical giant Novartis, Bexsero would be the first Meningitis B vaccine to be licensed for use in the UK.

Hope: Tommy is now learning to walk using his new prosthetic legs and can even kick a football

Next month, the independent Joint
Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the 
Government on vaccination, will suggest whether Bexsero should be in the
childhood immunisation schedule.

Meningitis UK and Meningitis Trust is a charity for the research and prevention of the disease and provides support services and after-care for sufferers.

Mr Brown said: 'We strongly support the campaign as we don't want anyone else to go through what we have, it still impacts on us now and will for life.

'It's a horrendous disease that kills or leaves people like our Tommy with awful after-effects.

'It's simple - there should be no question - the Government needs to act and put this vaccine on the NHS immediately.

'It will save so many lives and stop others from suffering like Tommy, so everyone should rally behind Beat it Now.'
