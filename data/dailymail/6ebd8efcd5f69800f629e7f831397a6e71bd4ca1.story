Charged: Dave Lee Travis has pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of sexual assault in Operation Yewtree

DJ Dave Lee Travis is selling his luxury £1 million home ahead of his sex offences trial.

Concerns over huge legal costs are understood to be a major factor behind the former Radio 1 presenter’s decision to downsize.

Travis, 68, and his wife have lived at Haselden House in Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, for more than a decade.

Mentmore, which was recorded in the Domesday Book, retains much of its Victorian history and has a 14th Century parish church.

Travis’s five-bedroom home is only a few hundred yards from a mansion owned by the billionaire Rothschild family.

A friend confirmed the couple would move before Christmas, and admitted the DJ’s looming court action may have increased his long-term desire to downsize.

Travis and his wife are understood to be moving to a smaller property close by, ahead of his Southwark Crown Court trial in January.

Last month, he pleaded not guilty to 14 charges of indecent assault and a further count of sexual assault by touching.

The alleged offences, dating from January 1976 to November 2008, are said to involve ten women and a 15-year-old girl.

Travis was first arrested a year ago as part of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

The probe has three strands –offences committed by Savile, offences committed by Savile and others, and offences allegedly committed by suspects unconnected with him.

Travis falls under the third category.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
