A bitter - and somewhat superstitious - ex has posted a Craigslist ad in Pennsylvania for a pretty diamond engagement ring with one small flaw: it used to belong to 'Satan herself.'

Along with a 1.5 carat diamond ring in a white gold setting, buyers should be aware when purchasing, writes the poster, that they also risk biblical plagues and a broken heart.

The poster concludes that if he is not successful in selling the ring by Christmas, he plans to throw the ring 'into the fires of Mordor.'

Not forever: The owner of this ring is hoping to be rid of it forever by Christmas to prevent it visiting any more disasters on him

The ring is for sale with a price tag of $1,800, which the poster writes is significantly less than he paid for it from Littman's.

Purchase of the ring must be made at your own risk though, warns the the seller, documenting a trail of destruction left in its wake.

'Possible events associated with this ring include but are not limited to: damage sustained to house, vehicle, heart, downed powerlines, fallen trees, and swarms of locus [sic],' reads the ad.

It is unclear whether the ring or 'Satan herself' was responsible for these catastrophes, but the poster recommends covering your bases.

'I would highly recommend taking action to counter the whirlwind of bad mojo that surround this piece of jewelry,' he writes, suggesting a voodoo priest may be able to exorcise the 'curse.'

Bad luck: The seller claims the pretty ring is responsible for destruction and heartbreak - a unique selling point

It seems the ring is the product of a broken engagement, as the woman to whom it belonged only wore it for 'a short period of time.'

The white gold and diamond ring with diamonds along the sides and a lower setting 'so the diamonds won't snag on everything' comes in its original box.

The ad was placed last week and is still active - so if Satan herself having been a previous owner is not a problem, buyers should nab it before Christmas when it will meet a fiery fate.

For sale I have a 1.5ct total weight engagement ring set in 14K white gold. The ring is in like new condition, only worn for a short period of time by Satan herself. Comes with the original box. Very pretty ring with a lower setting so the diamonds won't snag on everything. Diamonds along the sides and in the channel setting show off light from all sides. Originally purchased from Littman's for a sum of money far greater than I am comfortable admitting.Warning: ring may be cursed as it tends to leave a path of destruction behind it. Possible events associated with this ring include but are not limited to: damage sustained to house, vehicle, heart, downed powerlines, fallen trees, and swarms of locus. I would highly recommend taking action to counter the whirlwind of bad mojo that surround this piece of jewelry. Should consider having curse removed by voodoo priest or something before presenting to loved one. Other than that a very nice piece of jewelry.Looking to sell this soon before it brings any more bad luck into my life and I'd rather have cash. If not sold by Christmas I plan to throw it into the fires of Mordor.

During that time the Craigslist poster was visited with terrible misfortune

If it is not sold by Christmas the poster plans to pitch it into 'the fires of Mordor' rather than risk more destruction
