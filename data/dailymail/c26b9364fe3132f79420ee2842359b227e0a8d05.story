A tiny spider that lives in the Amazon has been filmed catching its prey using a method that would not look out of place in a comic book.

The spider, which is likely the species Naatlo splendida, stretches its web into a cone shape and then slings the sticky structure at flying insects to trap them.

The speedy slingshot manoeuvre was caught on camera at the Tambopata Research Centre in Madre de Dios, Peru.

The arachnid takes its place at a spot near the centre of its web, stretches it backwards and then slings its sticky structure – complete with itself – so that the web acts like a frog’s retractable tongue.

The speed of the manoeuvre gives the spider the element of surprise and seems to increase its chances of catching prey, rather than sitting and waiting for dinner to fly into its web.

The spider measures 3mm and belongs to the family Theridiosomatidae.

Lary Reeves, who works at the Peruvian centre, came across the creature in May 2013 while wading through a swamp looking for spectacled caiman.

Looking out for bullet ants, he noticed a web that was pulled back from the centre to form a cone and a spider holding it in a tensed position along the anchor line.

The spider filmed in the Amazon in Peru is thought to be the species Naatlo splendida.

It stretches its web into a come shape and then slings the sticky structure at flying insects to trap them.

The spider filmed measured 3mm and belongs to the family Theridiosomatidae.

It is possible the hairs on its body are sensory and tuned into the frequency of a fly's wings, in order to sense its prey nearby.

If the spider misses the target it simply resets its web.

The spiders could live throughout the Neotropics from Central America towards the southern parts of South America

Naatlo splendida was discovered around 80 years ago.

‘I looked at it a little closer, called everyone else over, and presumed that the spider released the tension in the web to capture prey.

‘As soon as the words left my mouth, a mosquito flew by and the spider slingshotted towards it,’ he said.

Mr Reeves said the web is similar in design to other orb webs – the two dimensional webs made by house spiders – to capture insects.

‘The big difference is that the centre of the web is anchored to the surrounding vegetation by a line that extends from the central hub to the anchor point,’ he explained.

Sitting in the centre of the web, the spider stretches it towards the anchor point ‘by crawling towards it and holding the bundled up slack in its legs’.

‘It's possible that the hairs on the spiders body are sensory, and tuned the frequency of a fly's wing beats.

'When the spider senses a fly or mosquito is within reach, it releases the tension on the line, propelling itself and the web at the flying insect.

‘If the spider misses, it seems to be able to reset the web/trap fairly flawlessly and with great ease,’ Mr Reeves said.

He is unsure if the technique is more effective than a conventional web, but said it is specialised to catch ‘fresh’ insects as they emerge from bodies of water.

Mr Reeves does not think the spiders risk death by propelling themselves at their prey.

‘The whole motion of the web seems to be pretty fluid. We observed the spiders firing the web when no insect was present - perhaps in response to vibrations from our breath or speech.

‘Because of this, it doesn't seem like it takes much to trigger them into releasing the web’s tension. If they were risking injury or death in propelling themselves in the web, I think the trigger would be much more conserved.’

The spiders could live throughout the Neotropics from Central America towards the southern parts of South America.

Phil Torres, a 27-year-old biologist from los Angles, California, said it is not the first time the spiders have been found, but not much is known about their behaviour.

In fact, the species – thought to be Naatlo splendida was discovered around 80 years ago.

Mr Torres thinks other types of spider webs are more limited in how they entangle their prey.

‘This method of flinging the web appears to make it much more likely that the prey will get tangled, as they seem to be getting slammed into sticky web regardless of the prey's original flight speed.

‘Imagine the difference between bumping into a sticky trap and having a sticky trap flung at you,’ he said.

The speedy slingshot action was filmed by 32-year-old photographer Jeff Cramer, from Lima, Peru, who used a Canon 6D and 7D with a couple of different macro lenses to get the shot.

He also used a Canon 100mm macro lens as well as a Canon MP-E 65mm lens.

‘It was a fairly difficult shot to get. We were in the middle of the amazon jungle, in the middle of the night and standing in about 50cm of water with mosquitos flying,’ he said.
