A man who was filmed battering his terrier after it had caught a rabbit has been banned from keeping animals for three years.

Jon Soley, 33, from Darlington, Co. Durham, was seen on mobile phone footage shown to a court forcefully kicking his Patterdale terrier, Billy.

Onlookers could be heard laughing and cheering as Soley repeatedly hit the small dog in the face with the dead rabbit.   

Kevin Campbell, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, told the court: 'He struck the dog and caused it to suffer. Anyone who treats a dog like that causes it to suffer.'

The dog, a family pet, can be seen cowering in the footage which was shown to Newton Aycliffe magistrates

Animal cruelty: Soley's solicitor agreed that the footage was disturbing but said he had kept dogs all his life 

In mitigation, John Grierson said that while he agreed the footage was disturbing, his client had no previous convictions for animal cruelty and had kept dogs all his life.

He told the court Soley had not sought treatment for his pet's mouth ulcer because it did not appear to be causing him any discomfort.

'Billy was a family pet - he went out for walks with the children in the family. He will regret the loss of the dog,' he said.

Soley had denied a charge of causing unnecessary suffering to the dog, and another of failing to meet its needs by not seeking veterinary treatment for a mouth ulcer, but was found guilty at Newton Aycliffe magistrates' court.

He also admitted two offences under the Wildlife and Countryside Act of possessing a cage trap and attempting to take a wild bird.

As well as a three-year ban on keeping animals, Soley was given a 12-month community order with 80 hours of unpaid work.

The court also heard that Soley, pictured above, had failed to seek treatment for the dog's mouth ulcer

The dog, which can be seen shrinking away as its owner approaches it, has been handed to the RSPCA 

He must also pay court costs of £1,200, a £60 victim surcharge and vet fees of £360.

Billy was signed over to the RSPCA and magistrates ordered the destruction of the mobile phone and bird cages.

Soley was arrested during dawn raids in May last year as part of Operation Stockholm - a joint initiative by the RSPCA and Darlington police to tackle animal cruelty in the area.

Speaking after the hearing, RSPCA chief inspector Mark Gent said he was pleased with the result and hoped it would act as a deterrent for others.

He said: 'This is a prime example of where we have undertaken a joint operation focussing on things that have been put on the internet and brought those people to justice.'
