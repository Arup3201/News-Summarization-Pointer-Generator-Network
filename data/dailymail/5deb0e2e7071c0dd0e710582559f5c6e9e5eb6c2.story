The party line from Spain as destiny awaits the world champions in the Maracana is that tiki–taka football is alive and well and the era goes on.

The private whisper is that they may be bracing themselves to turn and run with the wind of change which is blowing up an electrifying storm of goals in this World Cup.

D-day against the red-hot Chile peppers who gave England a recent roasting at Wembley stands not only for destiny but also decision.

Setback: Spain may have to lose their tiki-taka style in order to stay in the 2014 World Cup 

In terms which his countrymen will understand only too well, the Spanish manager is on the horns of a snorting bull of a dilemma.

Stick or twist?

Vicente del Bosque - who describes his team’s 5-1 collapse against Holland at the opening of their title defence as ‘unexplainable’ – confronts a choice which he has no need to tell us is unenviable.

Del Bosque, who accepts his job will be on the line if they fail to qualify from the group, says: ‘Tactically it will be a different game from Holland because Chile are brave and quick and risk attacking all the time.’

Fernando Torres, a possible replacement for Diego Costa, says: ‘I hope we can win playing our style at a high level but if not we have to win any way we can.’

It is an enormous risk for any team to change tack in the midst of a major tournament. For the winners not only of the last World Cup but also two successive European Championships, a change so drastic will be condemned as heresy if it fails.

Choices: Vicente Del Bosque must be considering changing the way his team play

So far as the eve of a match which could be pivotal for the development of the world game as well the outcome of Brazil 2014, the word is only that Spain are in profound deliberation.

We are unlikely to get the verdict until an hour before the kick-off here, when del Bosque hands in his team sheet.

For ‘uexplainable’ and unenviable read unthinkable in the minds of many if he sacrifices the high priests of tiki-taka, Xavi and Xabi Alonso, on the altar of accelerated pace, urgency and aggression.

If the names of Pedro, the only real speed merchant at the Barcelona academy of possession football, and Koke, the midfield energizer of Atletico Madrid’s remarkable season, take their places then it will be new-game on.

Perhaps he has still to make up his mind. Maybe that was why he closed the doors of the Maracana to prying eyes after the first 15 minutes of Spain’s supposedly open training session there 24 hours before kick-off.

Out? Diego Costa could lose his place in the starting line-up after a poor performance against Holland

But he has laid the ground for such a possibility by saying: ‘If we make changes after what happened in the second half against Holland we won’t be pointing a finger at anyone. All the players have our support but we have to manage the situation we are in.

‘We are capable of turning things around. We will keep doing several things the same way – but we are flexible.’

Not unnaturally, given all their successes over the past six years, most of the players are defensive of a winning system.

Pepe Reina will be the beneficiary if del Bosque comes to the conclusion that Jose Mourinho was probably right all along and drops Iker Casillas after his horror show against the Dutch. Liverpool’s goalkeeper says: ‘This team is not dead. We will reverse the notion that this is the end of an era.’

Del Bosque, one of the finest managers of any epoch, will be more open-minded. Tiki-taka was not his creation but that of Pep Guardiola at Barcelona and Del Bosque is not as wedded to it as the man who has taken the style on with him to Bayern Munich.

This Spanish inquisitor is very much his own man. He will be wise to the trends here. He will be aware that at the start of play on Day Six of this tournament more than 40 goals had already been scored compared with barely 20 at the same stage in South Africa four years ago, where Spain beat Holland with the only goal of the final.

Del Bosque will be acutely aware of why this is happening. He has seen Germany amplify the alliance of power, pace and non-stop work-rate to high-technique, which is now one trademark of the game.

He was too close for comfort as Holland demonstrated another, counter-attacking at blistering speed.

Andres Iniesta summed it up best: ‘At times, as well as keeping the ball, we will have to be faster and more direct. Now we have to win anyhow that works.’

Chile are not unlike the Dutch in that tactic. Although not quite as adept on the break as Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben, these South Americans do have a deadly rapier of a forward in Alexis Sanchez and they work flat out to supply him with chances.

This is a dangerous game. So is changing a playing philosophy on the hoof.

Del Bosque may settle for injecting some additional quickness but without fundamentally altering Spain’s basic structure.

Such a compromise would be fraught in itself but if anyone can pull off this trick without falling between two stools it is The Manager From La Mancha.
