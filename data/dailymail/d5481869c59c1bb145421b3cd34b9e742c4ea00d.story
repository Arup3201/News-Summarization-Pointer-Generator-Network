The wife of the Republican presidential candidate gave a passionate defense of the pro-life stance held by her and her husband during an appearance on daytime talk show The View.

Ann Romney said she will not be the one making the decisions but her husband, who is now running as a pro-life candidate in spite of serving as a pro-choice governor of Massachusetts.

'The good news is, I'm not running for office and I don't have to say what I feel. But I am pro life. I'm happy to say that,' she said.

'He could not have, on his conscience, 
creating human life for experimentation,' she said in reference to Mr 
Romney's decision against stem cell research during his time as 
governor.

Her View: Ann Romney appeared on the daytime talk show solo after her husband Mitt cancelled his appearance saying that the co-hosts are 'sharp-tongued and not conservative'

Range: The interview began by talking about reproductive rights but then progressed to lighter issues like chore wheels

'That's when he came out saying he was pro life. I think we all have to 
understand this is an issue that is so tender and there are people on 
both sides of the issue, with very good conscience, coming with a 
different opinion.'

‘Four years ago there were a lot of 
other issues on the table. What I hear from women now is “help, please 
help,”’ she said arguing that economic problems facing mothers concern 
them more than reproductive rights issues. 

‘If you really want to make a choice and those choices are about reproductive rights, that’s your choice.’

As governor of the majority Democratic state of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney supported a pro-choice stance on abortion, but as he his campaign has grown now to appeal to the entire country, his position has dramatically shifted towards the right.

Currently, Romney says that he would prefer to have abortion rights decided on the state level, with exceptions when it comes to cases of rape, incest, or when the health of the mother is in jeopardy.

All told, since 1994, Romney has publicly said that he supports nine different stances on abortion rights. The issue has become a central one to this year's presidential campaign as the next president will likely be in a position to appoint one or two new Supreme Court justices who, in turn, could affect the Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortions.

While her husband did not attend the show, she was accompanied by her middle son Josh.

Ann tried to make light of the
fact that her husband cancelled an appearance on daytime talk show The 
View because he thought that the show would be a high risk activity for 
him because the five female guests were all 'sharp-tongued and not 
conservative'.

Support: Josh Romney joined his mother during the show, sitting in the audience and addressing one question from the all-female cast of hosts

On the attack: Mrs Romney said that more women were concerned about economic issues than reproductive ones

‘No, he said sharp and young,’ Ann joked.

He
responded to questions about his brother Tagg's comments that while 
watching the most recent presidential debate, he wanted to 'take a 
swing' at President Obama because of the accusations he was hurling at 
their father.

'It's hard when you're in this process to see your dad get beat up out there... you take it pretty personally.

'I think that's something he was saying off the cuff and I assure you he didn't mean it.'Aside from the pointed political discussion about abortion rights at the beginning of the program,

Ann, wearing a red dress adorned with zippers and a breast cancer awareness pin, focused largely on lighter issues like the chore wheel at their house, the family's love of Costco, and her fondness of television.

'I'm a big TV fan, I just haven't had time to watch it,' she said.

She said that she has been avoiding television in general because she can't stand watching campaign ads.

Guests: Barack and Michelle Obama appeared on the show last month

'The American people are sick of 
campaign ads, am I right?' she said to the audience. Considering the 
show is taped in New York- a decidedly Democratic state that has little 
chance of voting for Mr Romney, very few of the audience members could 
claim to be inundated with ads.

'The audience members that are in swing states are sick of them,' Ann concluded.

As
the co-hosts splashed a picture of the entire Romney clan, including 
her five sons and their respective families, she described somewhat 
chaotic dinners at their lake house in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. After 
years of being stuck doing the lion's share of chores after meals, she 
turned to the classic concept of a chore wheel.

The
big change this year was that all of the grandkids made it on to the 
list- and on the rounds of the various roles- which resulted in gold 
stars and stuffed animals at the end of each week.

The View has become a popular venue for political interviews - Barack and Michelle Obama appeared on the show last month.

United front: Ann and Mitt have been married for more than four decades and have five sons

And
Mr Romney had planned to boost his rapidly improving poll performance 
by sitting down with Ann to show off his human side in what would be his
third appearance on The View.

But
on Monday's edition of the show, host Barbara Walters confirmed that 
the candidate had cancelled his appearance and had no plans to 
reschedule.

She told 
viewers that the GOP's first couple had been invited partly to combat 
accusations of bias, saying: 'I think that there are some people who 
think that we favour the Obamas, because they have been on the programme
separately and together.'

Ms Walters continued: 'Governor 
Romney was supposed to be on with us this Thursday with Ann Romney. We 
were looking forward to it.

'Over
the weekend, his people said that he had scheduling problems and would 
not be coming on with us. Nor at this point did he feel that he could 
reschedule.

'We are happy to have Mrs Romney on with us. We are sorry that we won't have Governor Romney and that's the situation.

'He can change his mind and we hope he does. It would be our pleasure to have him on the programme.'
