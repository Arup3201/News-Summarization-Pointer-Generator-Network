A cheerleading squad accused of cyber-bullying are outraged that they have been banned from practice and insisted this week that they have never bullied anyone.

McKinley High School senior Mariah Newton said the squad are no longer allowed to wear their uniforms or fundraise since the allegations.

Miss Newton claimed that there are no bullies on the junior or varsity cheerleading squads at the Honolulu school.

Cheerleader Mahealani Wilson said the cheerleaders have not bullied in 'any form' at McKinley High

She told Hawaii News Now: 'They just said, ''We got more reports of you guys bullying so we're shutting you guys down.'' That's basically what they said.'

Miss Newton said she spent four years committed to building up the team and that it was unfair to ban the girls from practice.

The school and the Department of Education are investigating the cyber-bullying claims with the superintendent adding: 'I know that some are involved.'

Another cheerleader Mahealani Wilson told the TV station that the cheerleaders had not bullied in 'any form'. 

Miss Newtown's father Darren said cheerleaders involved in bullying should be punished but that others sports teams had not been reprimanded in the past - in particular when football players assaulted a student and volleyball players verbally abused the cheerleaders. 

Mr Newton also complained that because the cheerleaders were no longer allowed to fundraise, parents were being left to shoulder the cost of uniforms.

The school intends to make a decision on who will be punished for cyber-bullying next week.
