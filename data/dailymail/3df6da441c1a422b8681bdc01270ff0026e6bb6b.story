Jennifer Lopez experienced her first real heartbreak when the Academy Award winning actor and star of Gone Girl, Ben Affleck called off their very public engagement in January, 2004.

The pain, tears and frustration only intensified when she realized that not only was the love affair over but so was the fairy tale family dream she had held onto throughout the intense media scrutiny that dubbed the couple ‘Bennifer.’

She hated that name.

Supercouple: ‘It felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest,’ the singer/actress confesses in her first memoir, True Love

Hint hint: Affleck's eyes were definitely not on Jennifer in this PDA. She called him brilliantly smart, loving, charming, affectionate

Ring a ding ding: Affleck put a 6.1-carat diamond on her finger when they got engaged in November 2002

‘It felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest,’ the singer/actress confesses in her first memoir, True Love, published by Celebra, a Penguin Random House imprint.

When asked about the man who placed a 6.1-carat pink damond on her finger she said, 'I'd probably say that he is brilliantly smart, loving, charming, affectionate. And I just admire him in every way. I respect him. I feel like he teaches me things.'

Lopez, 45, started to fall apart after all the high hopes and dreams evaporated of being the perfect girlfriend, wife and mother. Months of planning had gone into her vision of a fairy tale wedding, the walk down the aisle and that anticipated moment at the altar of committing to each other forever.

Affleck began dating Jennifer Garner just months after he broke it off with Lopez. When the couple married in the Turks and Caicos Islands in June, 2005, the new bride was four months pregnant with their first child, Violet. 

She feared being ridiculed in the press and envisioned headlines like ‘The Woman Who Has Everything But Can’t Get Love Right’!

She was at rock bottom – for three days --- when record producer/singer/songwriter Marc Anthony walked back into her life.

They were friends, worked on songs together and sang a duet in Spanish together, ‘No Me Ames’ or, ironically, ‘Don’t Love Me’ in English.

‘He was warm and funny, a brilliant singer and artist who knew how to make me feel special’, she writes. And he also made her laugh.

‘He was so sure of everything, and at this moment, when I felt so lost, so broken and alone, there he was’.

She believed maybe this was destiny stepping in and that she belonged with Marc and not with Ben Affleck.

The first time she met Marc in 1998 backstage while he was performing on Broadway, his first words to her were ‘One day you’re going to be my wife’ – a good come-on.

‘The reality was I didn’t want to be alone’, she confesses, and she let herself be swept up in his charm and his arms believing he was her ‘knight in shining armor.’

There wasn’t that same passion she had with other men but she thought she could ‘build something real with him, something that would last’.

Now she was back on target – and back under the dome -- for that fairy tale life she was chasing.

Marc saved her from her immediate painful emotional depths and in return, Lopez believed she could love him forever.

They married that same year, 2004, and she vowed that with two divorces and a broken engagement in the her past, she ‘was never going to give up on this love’.

Marc was going to be her rock and they’d live happily ever after. But that only happens in fairytales….

‘Things between Marc and me weren’t perfect – our marriage was never the kind to glide along peacefully’.

‘From the beginning, it was tumultuous, passionate, and explosive’…

She recognized there were problems but they loved each other and she was willing to try to work it through so that she could make her dream of a family come true – whatever the cost.

‘Family is most important’ – was her mantra.

Seven years later, in 2011, both knew the marriage was over.

‘My own happiness and sense of self-worth depended on how happy he was. So when Marc stated so clearly that he wasn’t happy, it broke me down completely’.

Back to ‘dying inside, feeling lonely and miserable and sad', she thought she might never be happy again.

But she had to get her ‘mojo’ back, she writes. She was exhausted and felt like a beached whale after having the twins. She needed to get back on stage – dance and sing.

She had to abandon the Hollywood diva concept in her head and head back to the Bronx to feel her roots once more – where she started, where she emerged as Jenny from the Block to step into the world’s music spotlight.

In the Bronx, a friend suggested she see a psychic.

His ‘vision’ was that she should go ahead with a world tour she had been planning because there was something important to be discovered while out on the road.

More insightful was therapy that helped her discover that she suffered from low self-esteem.

‘I had never truly believed I was great at acting, or anything else for that matter’.

‘I was always looking for the other person to tell me I was great so I could feel good about myself. I lived for that’.

She was finally learning self-love and it was heavenly being back on stage.

She finally found a new beginning.

‘No matter what else happened, I had my friends, my family, my kids…I hadn’t figured everything out yet and still had a long road ahead, but I was going to be alright’.
