Controversial: The Prince today highlighted the conflict in Ukraine while talking about the legacy of the First World war in Belgium

Prince William used a speech about the legacy of the First World War yesterday to highlight the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

In a rare foray into international diplomacy, the second in line to the throne suggested the Ukraine conflict was not just a localised war but a threat to the whole of Europe.

‘The events in Ukraine testify to the fact that instability continues to stalk our continent,’ he said.

He spoke at the Cointe Inter-allied Memorial in Belgium, where he was representing the Queen to commemorate the start of the Great War.

While his father frequently puts his head above the parapet on sensitive international matters, William normally shies away from such controversial issues.

However, addressing the audience in Liege, among them dignitaries including King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium, French president Francois Hollande and German president Joachim Gauck, the young royal said: ‘Edith Cavell was a British nurse who saved soldiers from each side.

'On the night before she faced a German firing squad she said, “I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.”

‘It took another terrible war to learn the truth of her words, and even today we continue to learn that lesson.

‘The events in Ukraine testify to the fact that instability continues to stalk our continent.’ As the prince spoke, news was breaking that Russia’s air force is to begin drills involving more than 100 aircraft from bases close to the Ukraine border.

Putin’s annexation of the predominantly ethnic Russian region of Crimea – the first by a major power in Europe since 1945 – has already sparked international condemnation.

In April, the Mail reported how Prince Charles told a Polish woman, who had lost many of her Jewish family in the Nazi Holocaust: ‘And now Putin is doing just about the same [in the Ukraine] as Hitler.’

His remark, made during an official tour of Canada, was seen as hugely inflammatory by the Russians. Putin described it as ‘unacceptable’ and ‘not royal behaviour’.

Warming to his theme, William did, however, go on to praise the power of reconciliation. He continued: ‘The fact that the presidents of Germany and Austria are here today, and that other nations – then enemies – are here too, bears testimony to the power of reconciliation.

'We were enemies more than once in the last century, and today we are friends and allies. We salute those who died to give us our freedom. We will remember them.’

Prince Charles flew the flag at a national service of remembrance for the Commonwealth in Glasgow, while the Duchess of Cornwall was guest of honour at a candlelit Vigil of Prayer Service in Westminster Abbey.

Prince Andrew was in Belfast, as the Earl and Countess of Wessex attended a ceremony at Guildford Cathedral, and Princess Anne attended a service of commemoration at Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight.

Prince Harry attended a ceremony on the coast at Folkestone in full Blues and Royals No 1 dress before flying to Belgium to join his brother and sister-in-law.

Harry was at the Step Short commemoration – so called because of the order given to servicemen to shorten their stride as they descended into the harbour of Folkestone, the port of embarkation to, and return from, the Western Front for millions.

The prince unveiled a 50ft, 13-ton Memorial Arch, the only new memorial to be built in this WWI centenary year. In a hand-written message on his wreath, Harry paid tribute to their heroism. ‘For all those who went down this road and never returned,’ he wrote.
