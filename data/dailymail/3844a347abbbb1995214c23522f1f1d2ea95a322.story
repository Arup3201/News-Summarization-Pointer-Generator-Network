A survivalist is hoping to outlast the Apocalypse with his latest purchase - a £15,000 Cold War bunker.

The underground shelter was built during the height of the Cold War in 1958 to protect key personnel in the event of nuclear war.

It is accessed through a small reinforced concrete hatch and ladder which leads 20ft down to a shower, small kitchen, chemical toilet and beds.

Welcoming: The bunker, with its own air supply, was originally used during nuclear exercises by the Royal Observer Corps

The bunker, with its own air supply, was originally used during nuclear exercises by the Royal Observer Corps.

But for nearly half a century it has become damp and neglected beneath the fields of a farm in Wadhurst, East Sussex.

Landowner Matthew Bramall, 58, who was a young boy when it was built by the Ministry of Defence, has now sold it to an undisclosed buyer.

He said: 'I wouldn't want to live there - even if it meant surviving the Apocalypse. You'd just be stuck in the ground.

The shelter was snapped up for a meagre £15,000 when farmer Matthew Bramall decided he didn't need a nuclear bunker any more

There are believed to be fewer than 1,000 Cold War nuclear bunkers left in Britain

The Cold War is the name given to the relationship that developed primarily between the West and the USSR after World War Two.

The Cold War was to dominate international affairs for decades and many major crises occurred - the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, Hungary and the Berlin Wall being just some.

For many, the growth in weapons of mass destruction was the most worrying issue.

As a result underground military bases where MPs and the RAF prepared for what might have been were built during the period.

About 1,500 of bunkers like the one in Wadhurst, East Sussex, at were built during the height of the Cold War in the 1950s, with many decommissioned less than 10 years later.

The three sites up for sale were used until 1992, when they were taken out of service following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Many have been bought by telecommunication companies and others are used as safe storage for computer systems, but also memorabilia collectors have been tempted to snap up the bunkers.

'It has been on the farm my whole 
life. When I was younger it was in use and soldiers would be posted 
there, but gradually they stopped coming back.'

He added: 'I have been selling bits of land over the last few years, and finally decided to get rid of the shelter.

'I was going to do something with it, but then I decided that if I wanted to live underground, I would live somewhere bigger.

'It's a total mess down there, and it's filled with stuff left over from when it was being used.'

The new owner of the bunker has told Matthew he plans to renovate it so it can be used in the event of a catastrophe.

Russ McLean, who runs a unique property website, said the bunker sale was an opportunity to buy a unique piece of construction for not very much money.

He said: 'They are really interesting and at a price you can afford, I'm not surprised this bunker was snapped up so quickly.

'It's a time capsule from a period of history that we will hopefully never have to revisit.

'They were seen as a beacon of hope in a terrifying time, but now I think an anti-nuclear bunker would be the perfect place to hide from your angry wife.'

There are believed to be fewer than 1000 Cold War nuclear bunkers left in Britain.

Mr Bramall has lived on the farm in Wadhurst, East Sussex, his entire life, and was only three when the MoD began construction on the subterranean structure
