A crime guide enabling residents to check if their railway station, shopping centre, supermarket or park is a hotspot for muggings or other offences went live today.

Police have delivered a huge expansion of the Home Office crime mapping website – which proved so popular when it launched last year it went into meltdown.

Other public spaces have been added to the www.police.uk maps include sports grounds, theatres, hospitals and even the areas outside police stations and prisons.

While nightclubs aren't named, people in the locality will know where crimes have taken place

The crime maps are now more specific with details of the type of venue that an offence happened

Transport hubs like train stations, airports and docks are included in the updated crime map

From today the public can use the maps to check on venues and destinations where they may wish to take extra care. Ministers hope it will help to drive up police standards.

Visitors to the site simply type a postcode or address and search for crimes that have happened nearby with a breakdown of the types of offences that have been committed.

The changes that have taken place today will mean that searches are more specific and people will be able to work out where particular crimes have taken place.

Month by month comparisons can be made for crimes in particular areas but the location-specific searches are only available for December 2011.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Armed with the information from those crime maps, people can attend their local neighbourhood beat meeting and hold their local police to account for their performance.’

Currently, homeowners can check for details of crimes reported to the police on residential streets.

It allows anyone in England and Wales to enter their postcode and find out police records of burglary, robbery, violence, vehicle crime and anti-social behaviour.

Police stations, like this one in Liverpool, have been included in the list of crime venues

Disorder: The police crime map gives a detailed street-by-street breakdown of where crime happens. However, there have been questions about its accuracy after a string of blunders

In Portsmouth there was anger and ridicule when 
Surrey Street (pictured) - showed it having, in December alone, 136 crimes, 
including burglary, violence and anti-social behaviour. In fact there were only two

Previously, crimes were mapped to an 
anonymous point on a street with 12 or more postal addresses. From 
today, it will include streets containing as few as eight addresses.

It 
will give information about railway stations and police will also begin 
the process of adding other public areas.

These will include airports, bus and coach stations, ferry terminals, 
motorway service stations, petrol stations, nightclubs, police stations,
 sports and recreation areas, race tracks, theme parks, parking areas 
and pedestrian subways.

Officers will also add further and higher education buildings, shopping 
areas, supermarkets, theatre and concert halls, conference and 
exhibition centres, hospitals, prisons, and parks and other open spaces.

Not all the information will be available immediately, but the process 
will get under way from today. In the longer-term, pubs could also be 
added to the list.

In the case of a nightclub, the map will show the location of the 
building, but only the word ‘nightclub’, rather than its name. Those 
living nearby will be expected to know the name of the venue.

Nick Herbert, minister for policing, said: ‘The public appetite is clear with 453million hits to the website since its launch.

‘Information is power – and crime mapping helps transfer power back to local people.’

From May, the website will also begin to carry details of what happens 
after a crime has occurred in terms of a response or a conviction.On the
 day of its launch last January, the crime map website came doubly 
unstuck within hours.

First, a string of errors meant leafy streets with just a handful of 
incidents ranked alongside the worst urban crime zones in Britain, 
leaving residents venting their fury. Then, to add to embarrassment over
 the £300,000 site, the Home Office was forced to pull the plug when it 
crashed under the strain of 18million hits an hour.

Since then, it has proved hugely popular with the public – but has also 
attracted criticism in some quarters. A recent survey claimed thousands 
of crimes go unreported because victims fear the information will damage
 house prices.

The launch of the new website comes as police yesterday claimed they 
will suffer ‘financial hardship’ after Mrs May forged ahead with plans 
to axe £150million from their annual pay and perks.

Officers will get to keep – for now – a controversial competence-related
 payment known as ‘grab-a-grand’ because it is paid to so many officers.
 The payments, worth up to £1,200, are aimed at constables at the top of
 their pay scale who can only earn more money by being promoted. A 
premium rate of time and a third will also be kept for casual overtime.

But a so-called ‘special priority payment’, which costs the taxpayer 
around £90million a year, will be axed. Normally worth up to £3,000, 
these are handed out as a reward for dealing with ‘specially demanding 
working conditions’.

This was recommended for the chop in a review of police pay and 
conditions by lawyer Tom Winsor – who said savings worth up to £1billion
 could be made overall.

Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police Federation, said: ‘Whichever way 
you dress it up, this will mean serious financial hardship for police 
officers.’
