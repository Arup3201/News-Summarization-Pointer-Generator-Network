Suki Waterhouse has sparked rumours that she is to become a Victoria's Secret model after posting a photo of herself wearing giant feather wings on Instagram.

The 22-year-old girlfriend of Bradley Cooper looked every inch the Angel in an elaborate peacock-inspired ensemble comprising a showstopping headdress and an embellished lattice-style bodice. 

While Victoria's Secret refused to confirm or deny the news, the photo lends heavy evidence to the rumour that Suki will be walking in the December 2nd show.

It is also typical of Victoria's Secret to cast the industry's most buzzed-about models, and Suki certainly fits that bill.

This year alone, she has fronted campaigns for Burberry and designed a range for footwear for Superga. 

She is also an actress, appearing in the new film Love, Rosie and the upcoming Divergent: Insurgent movie alongside Shailene Woodley.

And though she refuses to discuss her relationship with Bradley Cooper in any detail, dating a Hollywood superstar for the past 18 months has not hurt her profile either.

The highly-anticipated Victoria's Secret catwalk show will be taking place at Earls Court in Suki's hometown of London this year, instead of New York, and tickets are already selling for £10,000 apiece. 

It is always a star-studded affair. In addition to A-list musical performances (last year, Taylor Swift sang), the show will feature appearances from established Angels including Alessandra Ambrosio, Candice Swanepoel and Doutzen Kroes.

This year, Kim Kardashian's younger sister Kendall Jenner is also tipped to make her debut for the lingerie giant - like Suki, she is one of this year's most successful models and has appeared in campaigns for Givenchy and walked the runway for Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs and Chanel to name but a few.

A spokesman for the brand would only tell MailOnline: 'The official line-up will be announced soon so please stay tuned!'
