Climate change.... its complex, intimidating and the source of many heated debates. The topic is a controversial one, that has created a barrage of skepticism, but Why? It's because the impacts are often not immediately noticeable, nor are the benefits of acting against it.

A group of passionate individuals have dedicated their life to studying climate change, but they too have become frustrated with the powerful issue and have now revealed how they actually feel and what their concerns are.

Scientists from around Australia have put pen to paper in handwritten letters as part of an independent project and they have unleashed their anger over inaction and ignorance, which they warn will cause severe water shortages and even war.

Australian National University student Joe Duggan and science commentator has talked to scientists and asked them to write the letters about how they felt about climate change.

The results have been eye opening and have all been published on the, Is This How You Feel website for all to see.

The letters are personal, some with a little humour, while others disclose their frustration and inner feelings about what they have been studying for years.

Dr Elvira Poloczanska seemed frustrated by how unfazed people are by the issue.

'It amazes me that people still question whether we, as a species, are having an impact on our planet and climate. There are seven billion of us on the planet.'

Associate Professor Kevin Walsh was very open about his views, saying he wished that climate change wasn't real.

'This seems like a strange thing for a climate scientist to say, but it’s true. If climate change were not real, we would not have to be concerned about it.'

Dr Allie Gallant was definitely frustrated saying, 'I hate feeling helpless. I’m ashamed to say that, sometimes, my frustration leads to apathy. I hate feeling apathetic.'

Others resorted to a bit of humour to express their point of view. 

'Dear Earth, Just a quick note to say thanks so much for the last 4 billion years or so. It's been great! I’m really sorry about the last couple of 100 years – we’ve really stuffed things up haven’t we! I thought we climate scientist might be able to save the day but alas no one really took as seriously.' wrote Professor Brendan MacKey.
