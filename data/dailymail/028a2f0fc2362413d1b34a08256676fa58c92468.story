Most children prefer to play outside rather than watch television but they are restricted to their back gardens by over-anxious parents, new research has revealed.

They are being prevented from venturing unaccompanied into the street, local park, woods or any open green space due to families’ safety fears about traffic and ‘stranger danger’.

These areas have become ‘out-of-bounds’ for adventurous youngsters even though many would prefer to explore these areas rather than be stuck in front of tablets, TV and computer screens.

The study from Eureka! The National Children’s Museum, based in Halifax, West Yorkshire, highlights concerns of an ‘over-active obsession with protecting children from all types of potential harm’.

Its report, co-authored by Rebecca Caswell of the museum, said: ‘Parents must be provided with the tools and confidence to allow their children more freedom to play outside or the next generation of children will become even more housebound than the current one.’

The museum surveyed 1,367 adults and 1,456 children aged five to 11 about their views on play.

Eighty-one per cent of children said they preferred to play outside than watch TV. However, 59 per cent said they ‘were never allowed to leave the home or garden unsupervised’.

Ninety-five per cent of adults said they believed risk in play was ‘beneficial’. But a quarter believed play ‘could be improved by making the world safer’.

These concerns were reflected in the distances parents allowed youngsters to venture. Just under half (49.7 per cent) admitted they did not allow their children to play outside their own homes and gardens alone.

Only 0.5 per cent said they let their children explore ‘as far as they want to’.

Just 37 per cent allow their sons and daughters to go as far as the end of the street without supervision.

Researchers also asked children to pick their three top places to play. These were parks (54 per cent) followed by the garden (45 per cent) and the home (42 per cent).

This contrasted with parents’ answers who cited their childhood favourites as the street (46.7 per cent), fields or woods (44.5 per cent) and the garden (39.8 per cent)

Sixty-seven per cent of children said they preferred ‘free, unstructured play’ rather than participating in organised games and activities.

Of the 25 hours a week average that children spent playing, parents said only 17 per cent of this time was spent with technology.

The report, Play For Today, said: ‘What we found was that, contrary to perceptions in the media, children aren’t permanently glued to technology and actually have a preference for playing outdoors.

‘Similarly, their parents really do see play as a fundamental tool to their child’s development and see it as being as important as formal education.

‘However, limited time and anxiety around leaving children to their own devices to play outdoors has meant that the instinctive default for most families is to keep children indoors.’

It added: ‘Free, unbounded, independent play in a variety of outdoor environments such as the street, park, local woods or any open green space is out-of-bounds for many children, unless accompanied by their parents or an adult carer.

‘This is a major concern, particularly given that children are now subject to closer scrutiny over their academic abilities at an even earlier age than previous generations.’

In other findings, 33 per cent of adults said they did not have sufficient time to play with their children.

In July, former children’s minister, Tim Loughton, warned that children spend nearly a year slumped in front of the TV or staring at computer screens by the time they are seven.

In a report titled ‘The state our children are in’ for the charity 4Children, the Tory MP cited research by a psychologist suggesting today’s children were at risk of a lifelong dependency on TV and computer screens.

Mr Loughton called for a crackdown on the ‘health and safety’ mentality that stopped children taking part in rough and tumble activities.

He cited NHS statistics that showed half as many children are being admitted to hospital after falling out of a tree compared to ten years ago.
