A Tory MP has been ordered to repay £1,000 in expenses after claiming more than twice the distance for car journeys.

The expenses watchdog found Bob Blackman's did not match up with the distances they researched using Google Maps. 

In one case a two-mile journey to Harrow Weald had been claimed as 10 miles.

An investigation by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) has found that the Harrow East MP submitted more than 700 'inaccurate' claims. 

The Ipsa inquiry's provisional findings said today: 'The Compliance Officer has concluded that mileage claims submitted by Mr Blackman are, in almost every instance, not accurate and greater than the distance travelled. This is disputed by Mr Blackman.'

Compliance Officer Peter Davis found that Mr Blackman - who now has 15 days to appeal - wrongly submitted claims for travelling from his constituency home to his office, and for going to party political events and canvassing sessions.

The report also revealed that Ipsa has been warning him about high mileage claims since 2011.

In October 2011 that year officials wrote to him voicing concern that he was putting in for 'around twice the average for constituency mileage across the UK and some six times higher than other suburban London area constituencies where mileage is claimed'.

Ipsa bosses requested an initial investigation by the compliance officer in December 2012, saying he appeared to be hugely over-estimating distances and rounding them to the nearest five miles.

'A comparison of your claims against the distances quoted by Google Maps would suggest a pattern of over-claiming. On average, your claims are almost twice the distance shown on Google Maps and in some cases significantly more,' he was told at the time.

Initially the watchdog decided against a formal investigation, choosing instead to deal with the issue through 'support and advice from Ipsa to ensure the MP improved his record-keeping'.

But an audit in 2013-14 found that Mr Blackman had again racked up the highest mileage of any MP. 

He claimed more than 400 miles per square mile of his constituency, almost double that put in for by the next 10 highest-claiming MPs.

The compliance officer this time launched a formal probe - but only looked at claims made after his meeting with the MP in January 2013.

He found that Mr Blackman had merely reduced his standard claims for regular journey by a single mile - for example, saying he drove 14 miles to Stanmore rather than 15.

The compliance officer has made clear that he could now revisit Mr Blackman's claims prior to January 2013 - potentially opening him up to further demands to repay money.

An Ipsa statement said: 'Following the results of the provisional findings, and subject to representations received, the compliance officer is considering whether there is a need to review Mr Blackman's mileage claims from before January 2013, the start point for the current investigation.'
