He is the co-founder of Chrysalis Records and the man who catapulted pop band Blondie to worldwide fame, so it seems only natural that music mogul Terry Ellis’s pioneering spirit should extend to the seven-bedroom home he built in the British Virgin Islands.

Shannon House on Tortola has spectacular views of the Atlantic and is surrounded by lush tropical gardens. 

With its lagoon-shaped swimming pool and colonial-style interiors, the £2.1 million home wouldn’t look out of place in a luxury travel brochure.

‘There was nothing but jungle and volcanic rock here when I bought the land,’ says Terry, who bought the site from his close friend Chris Blackwell – founder of Island Records and mentor of Bob Marley – in 1978. ‘I had to trek through the jungle with a cutlass just to get to see it.’

Terry’s music career began when he was studying at Newcastle University. An ardent pop fan, he became social secretary for the students’ union and booked acts such as The Animals, Cream and Rod Stewart before they became household names.

‘I was looking for the full college experience,’ he explains. ‘So when I started, I said to the head of the students’ union, “I can run something, give me a job.” They said, “We need somebody to book pop groups.” ’

Even though he lacked experience, Terry proved a natural. After graduating, he juggled his day job as a computer systems analyst with managing bands in the evenings and at weekends.

When he started to make enough money from his music commissions, he gave up the computer job.

In 1969, he formed Chrysalis Records with Chris Wright – the venture gets its title from an amalgamation of the names of the two founders. 

The company expanded to the US in 1975, opening an office in Los Angeles, and Terry began renting an apartment on Tortola, the largest of the British Virgin Islands.

‘I’d had a love affair with the Caribbean after holidays there,’ he says. ‘The British Virgin Islands are very special – they feel very British. I knew I wanted to settle there but couldn’t find a house I liked, so I decided to build one. 

'It’s a beautiful spot with tremendous privacy. It’s set on a ridge and very high up, so the views are spectacular.’

Terry employed a ‘genius’ architect, Michael Helm, who created an Indonesian-style property with lots of open terraces to maximise the panoramic views. 

Helm cleverly incorporated and built around the existing volcanic rock so that the wall of one of the living rooms is a 30ft-high boulder.

Halfway through the project, Terry met his future wife Daniele on a blind date in London. She had two young children, Frederic and Beatrice, from her first marriage.

‘She visited Tortola and walked around the building site making adjustments so that it suited a family – much to the chagrin of the architect who thought he was building the ultimate bachelor pad,’ he laughs.

By the end of the building project, Terry and Daniele were engaged and they married on Tortola in 1980 – their wedding reception was held at the house.

Price: $3.25 million (£2.1 million)

Location: Tortola, British Virgin Islands

Bedrooms: Seven

Unique features: Built on a volcanic outcrop; spectacular panoramic views; lagoon-shaped two-tier swimming pool

The couple went on to have three daughters together – Amber, Kimberley and Tiffany. ‘We added bedrooms as we kept on having children,’ says Terry. 

‘I don’t remember how much it all cost, but it was more than I expected.’ There are also four separate cottages on the estate.

There is a large expat community in the British Virgin Islands – about half the residents are from the UK, the US, Canada and South Africa – with many people working in the financial services sector.

Although there is an international school on Tortola, the Ellis children were educated in New York. Terry, now 70, tried to retire in 2000 but found he wanted to keep working.

Reluctant to sell: Terry Ellis, who co-founded Chrysalis Records and made Blondie into a global star, has decided to downsize now that his children are all grown up and scattered around the world

He ran his own wine company in New York for five years and now travels the world speaking about his music career at colleges.

Terry and Daniele have decided to downsize as their children are adults now and are ‘scattered around the world’.

‘The house has been such a big part of our lives so there will be tears when we sell,’ Terry says. ‘It’s a special house and it requires a special person.’
