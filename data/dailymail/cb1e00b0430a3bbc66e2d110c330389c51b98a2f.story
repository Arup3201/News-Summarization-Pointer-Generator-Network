Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

The Cesc Fabregas transfer saga rumbles on in the Spanish newspapers on Tuesday, with Mundo Deportivo reporting that Barcelona want 36m euros (£29m) to let him return to the Premier League.

Barca want to recoup most, if not all, of the £35m they shelled out to bring Fabregas back to the club in 2011 and will dig their heels in over the fee.

Bidding war: Sport lead on the same story, with Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United all interested in signing the Spain star this summer

Mundo also say that Chelsea have emerged as the favourite to sign the Spain international, seeing him as the ideal replacement for Frank Lampard, who is set to move to the MLS.

Sport, meanwhile, have the same player but three different fees on their front page, next to a picture of an auctioneer's gavel.

'Who gives more?' it says, with Manchester United apparently prepared to offer 43m euros (£34m), Chelsea 40m euros (£32m) and Arsenal 36m euros (£29m).

What is clear is that there will be no shortage of interest in Fabregas this summer and Barcelona are certainly open to a deal.

The big news in Spain on Monday was the abdication of King Juan Carlos and Marca and AS have managed to put a sporty spin on it.

The breaking news meant Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy was half-an-hour late for his official photograph with the Spain World Cup team before they departed for Washington, where they are set to play El Salvador in a final warm-up game.

Long live the King: Marca feature a picture of heir to the Spanish throne Felipe VI with the World Cup - the new monarch has kept July 13 free in case they make the final

'A justified delay' reads the headline on AS, as the squad travelled to the American capital in the King's private jet.

Marca's headline reads 'Long live the King' and features a picture of his successor, Felipe VI, with the World Cup after Spain's triumph in 2010.

The new monarch will ensure he has no other duties on July 13 just in case he has to fly to Brazil to watch the final.

The paper also has a couple of Real Madrid lines - one on their bright pink change kit for next season and another on their fears that a relapse of Cristiano Ronaldo's patella tendon problem at the World Cup could leave him sidelined for some time.

In Italy, Gazzetta dello Sport lead on the 'Balotelli mystery' with the Azzurri heading to the World Cup with much uncertainty hanging over the Milan striker.

Let me go: Tuttosport report that Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata has expressed a desire to leave for Juventus

Rumblings of a transfer, possibly back to the Premier League, continue to intrigue the fans and there are also doubts about his fitness with Italy's first match, against England in Manaus, a week on Saturday.

Milan supremo Silvio Berlusconi is quoted as saying that Balotelli's future will be decided in a sit-down with the club's new manager after the tournament has concluded.

As Balotelli labours, another national team striker, Giuseppe Rossi, fumes. He was chopped from Cesare Prandelli's provisional squad and won't be going out to Brazil, as picked up by Corriere dello Sport.

Prandelli claims that Rossi knew he was not going to make it.

Corriere also report that Ciro Immobile has completed his move from Torino to Borussia Dortmund, with his medical completed and the contract signed.

Tuttosport have the latest on Alvaro Morata's possible move from Real Madrid to Juventus.

They say that Morata has said he wants a move to the Italian champions after turning down a fairly optimistic bid from Wolfsburg.
