The Mauritius-born photographer describes himself as a ‘rooftopper’ and he said he finds Dubai most appealing when it is shot from the highest vantage points.

 When thick fog blankets Dubai the city looks more like a scene from a science fiction film, says the keen photographer

At 2,716.5 feet, Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world and has the highest outdoor observation deck in the world

Daniel added: ‘It is very modern and futuristic and when the fog comes in, it's a city from a sci-fi movie.

‘Photography is just a hobby but I do it very passionately.

‘I will keep chasing fog in Dubai - I always look for the “wow factor.”’
