A pet lizard has gone missing from a garden after being let out of the house for some exercise.

The 5ft long reptile was not considered dangerous, according to South Wales Police, but it is big enough to give anyone who bumps into it a shock.

The lizard disappeared from King Edwards Road in Swansea, South Wales, at around 4.30pm yesterday.

The giant black-and-white lizard was exercising in its owner's garden but managed to escape - anyone who sees it is requested to call the police on 101 immediately

Inspector Andy Walbeoff, of South Wales Police, said: 'The lizard is not considered to be dangerous. However, its owner is concerned for its welfare.

'It has black and white scales and short legs and is described as being a bit puffy around the neck.

'If seen by a member of the public they are requested to call the police on 101 immediately so arrangements may be made for its recovery.'

The giant black-and-white lizard was out in the owner's garden for its regular exercise but managed to disappear. 

Officers stressed the reptile is not dangerous, but issued a picture in a bid to track it down as quickly as possible.

The incident comes a week after a boa constrictor snake was let loose in Portsmouth, South England, when a taxi driver refused to allow it in his cab.

The boa was allegedly wrapped around the passenger's neck as he hailed the cab.

When the passenger was told he was not allowed into the taxi with the snake, he then allegedly threw it into a hedge and jumped into the cab.

That incident sparked a city-wide search for the boa by police and firefighters.
