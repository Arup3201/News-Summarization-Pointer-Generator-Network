The Home Office was forced to admit yesterday that it had lost track of hundreds of dangerous foreign criminals awaiting deportation.

Instead of being locked up until they are thrown out of the UK, 758 offenders from overseas, including murderers, rapists, robbers and paedophiles, have vanished after being let out of prison.

For the first time, the Mail can reveal the crimes committed by those who have absconded after completing their sentences – meaning they could still pose a serious threat.

There are 4,247 overseas criminals living in Britain due for deportation and among the 758 – or one in six – who have gone missing are ‘high harm’ individuals at risk of committing the gravest crimes.

In a snapshot of those let out of prison by March last year, those who had absconded included up to 12 killers, 11 rapists, 46 violent thugs, 152 drug dealers, 33 robbers and 23 other sex offenders. 

At least 115 had been jailed for at least four years – an indication of the seriousness of their crimes.

The figures were obtained from the Home Office by the Commons’ Public Accounts Committee after ministers previously refused to publish them.

Foreign criminals who commit serious offences are automatically considered for deportation, but once offenders are released from jail they are rarely put on a plane home.

They can only be placed in a detention centre if there are realistic prospects they will be removed swiftly because judges would otherwise order them to be released. 

It means that thousands of criminals are placed back in the community with a request to keep in touch with immigration officials. But many simply slip off the radar.

Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank, said: ‘It is a disgrace that on top of letting the wrong people into the country, we cannot even reliably get rid of them at the end of their sentences.

‘We need a simple process for ensuring all foreign criminals are deported at the end of their sentences. 

'We also must look at controlling our borders better so that those who come here are not likely to commit crimes in the first place.’

Lord Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: ‘It is shocking that so many serious offenders should have been able to abscond. 

'We need to change the law so that it permits serious criminals to be detained until arrangements can be made to deport them, however long that takes.’

There are hopes the deportation process can be speeded up. The Mail reported yesterday how judges have backed the new ‘deport first, appeal later’ regime that means criminals can be kicked out, forcing them to fight appeals in their home country.
