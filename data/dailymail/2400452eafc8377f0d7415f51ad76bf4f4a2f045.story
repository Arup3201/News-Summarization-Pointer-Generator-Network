A former Utah high school teacher accused of having sex with three underage students is behind bars after a judge ordered her held without bail following the alleged revelation she continued relations with one of the students while awaiting trial.

Judge John Morris said at a pre-trial hearing Thursday that Brianne Altice will stand trial for the new charges of rape, unlawful sexual activity and dealing harmful material to a minor in addition to the dozen other felonies she already faced.

While authorities and many members of the Davis County community are eager to put Altice away for years, the 35-year-old has a cheerleader in one of her alleged victims.

Brianne Altice listens to the testimony of a teenager who gave details about his sexual relationship when he was 17-years old with Altice, his former Davis High School teacher during a preliminary hearing Thursday

'She doesn't deserve to be here': The alleged victim did not want to testify against the woman he said he once considered his girlfriend, calling the charges against her 'ridiculous'

The young man, now 18, testified against his former teacher Thursday despite being 'very unhappy' about doing so, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. 

'It's ridiculous,' he said. 'She doesn't deserve to be here.'

He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013--when she was initially arrested--and then three more times after that December while she was out on bail.

At the conclusion of the hearing, Morris ordered Altice jailed without bail, siding with the prosecution's argument that Altice's 'willingness to continue to commit felony sexual offenses while on bail causes great concern that this defendant will continue and be a danger to the community.'

Altice will next see the inside of a courtroom on January 22, when she'll appear for a scheduling hearing.

Altice taught English at Davis High School before she was fired last February.

Altice was first arrested in October 2013 on suspicion of having sex with a student.  

Altice is now facing more than a dozen felony counts, including rape and sexual abuse, in two different cases. She has pleaded not guilty to the older charges

In August of 2014, a second student came forward accusing Altice of carrying on a physical relationship with him as well.

Now, the former educator who lost her job and saw her marriage break apart in the aftermath of the scandal faces felony counts stemming from her alleged encounters with three minors.

The charges against Altice include first-degree rape, first-degree forcible sodomy and second-degree forcible sexual abuse.

Altice’s attorney, Edward Brass, has said in court his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students.

In deep: Brianne Altice, 35, was arrested again last week on four new sex abuse charges and released from jail after posting $10,000 bail, court documents say

‘It is her defense that they did not happen at all,’ Brass wrote in a motion. ‘That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students ...’

Prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with the 16-year-old boy on two occasions. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body.

But Brass has asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home last October to interview her about the allegations.

Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her. 

Altice faces 10 charges in the earlier case, which involves the 17-year-old and two other students

'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers.

'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.'

In September, one of the teenage boys, now 18, offered graphic details during his testimony about how he went from being Altice's student to allegedly having sex with her in his Farmington home.

The teen testified that he was 17-years-old when he became involved with Altice between April and June of 2013, according to The Salt Lake Tribune.

He said it began with kissing between class periods and eventually graduated to sexual intercourse.

When asked to describe his relationship with Brianne Altice, the teenage boy said she was his 'teacher with benefits.'
