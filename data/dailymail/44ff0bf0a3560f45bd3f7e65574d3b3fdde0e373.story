Primark became famous for its cheap and cheerful take on catwalk looks, but there's nothing budget about the High Street giant's latest campaign.

The edgy images and fashion-forward styling wouldn't look out of place in a copy of Vogue.

But die-hard fans needn't worry, the so-hot-it-hurts fashion still comes at purse-friendly prices.

Darkly glamorous: The punk-meets-highlander collection includes lashings of tartan and spiky details

Luxe: Elegant baroque print brings this simple dress up to date while black lace (right) is a huge trend

The
moody low-lit images show the brand's darkly sexy 
vision for autumn, complete with lashings of tartan, in a combination it
describes as 'Highland Grunge.'

And while the photography has gone up a class or two in recent seasons, prices certainly haven't with bargains galore, including a stylish pair of £12 cobalt trousers and a chunky gold pyramid ring for just £1.50.

Elsewhere, there's plenty of lace, a huge trend for autumn, as well as discreet sheer panels, a soupcon of faux leather and the odd peekaboo insert.

For those who plumped for goth rather than punk during their teens, there's a surfeit of crushed velvet, including on punky crop tops, studded heavy boots and glam rock bomber jackets dusted with gold sequins.

Other stand out pieces include a £13 baroque inspired midi dress in a rich ruby red, and a pair of Rihanna-esque sequinned gold shorts for just £14.

Chunky jewels: The new range includes plenty of accessories including eye-catching necklaces such as this

Gothic: A neat black jumpsuit has a discreet peekaboo detail while crushed velvet ups the vamp factor

Dressing down: Weekend-wear retained a punky edge softened with cute Bambi motifs

Bargain: These striking cobalt blue trousers cost just £12 while sequins add glamour to this bomber jacket

In menswear, the Scottish Highlands also proved influential, although it was crofters rather than clansmen providing the inspiration for the boys.

Chunky Fair Isle jumpers, complete with prints that would have made William Wallace proud, muted yellow beanies and chunky cord shirts all took centre stage.

Formal wear also has a similarly Scottish feel, with tartan splashed across everything from suits to knits paired with heavy velvet smoking jackets.

There's even a £28 'value tux', although men in the market for a budget party outfit will also have to splash out extra for a shirt.

Denim featured also heavily, with a chunky cord-collared denim jacket, billed by the brand as a seasonal must-have, coming in at just £23, while jeans, in a range of different washes, cost £10 a pair.

For those in search of something a bit more light-hearted, the brand took Mickey Mouse as its inspiration for print, splashing Disney's iconic rodent across everything from polo shirts to drop-crotch joggers.

Cosy: Menswear was heavy on the Scottish motifs, including classic tartan and Fair Isle knits

Caledonian: Vintage prints, tweed and tartan are all Scotland-inspired favourites that featured in the collection
