This is the moment a stray cat was pulled out of its hideaway by firemen - after wedging itself in the engine of a car.

The startled animal looked far from amused after being removed from the engine block of a car in the city of Van in eastern Turkey.

Driver Nurullah Kurman found the cat after noticing that the vehicle was not driving properly on his journey to the shops.

After trying and failing to free it, the 40-year-old decided to call the fire service for help - but even emergency crews struggled to find a solution. 

Mr Kurman told local media: 'I opened up the hood and realised that there was a cat inside which was interfering with the mechanism. I tried to get it out but failed, and so I called the fire service to see if they could get it free.'

He said that he was worried about driving the car with the creature inside in case it caused a crash adding that he did not want to see the cat hurt.

Despite trying several tricks - including pouring cold water on the animal - fire crews eventually decided to tow the car to a nearby garage.

Mechanics then spent two hours taking the car apart before firemen could put their hands inside and pull the cat free.

Pictures taken at the time show the moment the soaking wet cat was pulled out of the engine and handed over to staff from an animal charity. 

The stray is now recovering having undergone treatment at a vets for a broken leg it suffered at some point during its ordeal. Charity bosses are trying to find it a new home.

Mr Kurman, who was hit with a £50 bill for the work on his car, added: 'I thought that because I called the firemen and they towed it here it would be paid for by the state. It is a stray cat, I don't see why I should have to pay for it?'

But in the end he paid and left, adding: 'I hope the cat gets well soon, and next time stays away from car engines however warm and inviting they may seem at first.'
