Robbie Morgan is accused of demolishing a house after driving in his father's Jeep

A teenage driver demolished a house and knocked down a pedestrian with his dad's Jeep after swerving off the road while speeding, a court heard today.

Robbie Morgan, 18, had only been driving for six months when he got behind the the wheel of his father's 4x4 Jeep after he left a party to buy cigarettes.

But a court heard Morgan sped off the road in the £30,000 vehicle, before knocking down an 18-year-old girl causing life-threatening injuries, hitting a car and smashing into a house.

It knocked down the two-storey extension of the terraced house - leaving the home in ruins.

Homeowner Lucie Flowers, 38, only escaped because she was in an upstairs room watching EastEnders.

The court heard A-level student Morgan 'put his foot down' in the four litre Jeep Cherokee hitting speeds of up to 60 miles an hour along a quiet village road.

Prosecutor Jonathan Howell said: 'Morgan had only been driving for six months.

'He was 17 at the time and was driving a Jeep Cherokee in poor weather conditions - it was dark, wet and windy.

'The car he was driving was too powerful.

'He had been at a sixth form party at a rugby club, he left with two friends and was driving to get a takeaway and some cigarettes.

'They were travelling along the road when Morgan put his foot down - he was driving too fast for the 30mph road.

'A Renault Megan tried to turn safely across the road but Morgan was going too fast.

'He tried to brake but there was not enough distance, he veered to try and avoid the collision.

'But he hit that car and went on going, knocking down a pedestrian who suffered horrific injuries requiring hospitalisation.

'He then ploughed into a house causing extensive damage.'

It caused damage running 'into five figures' to the home of Mrs Flowers and the extension had to be rebuilt.

Morgan had two school friends in the three ton Jeep when it smashed into the house in Nelson, near Caerphilly, South Wales.

Friend Yarden Aaron, 18, told the court: 'I felt the car getting faster and faster, it was too fast to be OK on that road.

'We were driving between 50 and 60 miles per hour, I don’t believe he was in control of the car.'

Pedestrian Geraldine Downy, 18, was treated at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff treated her for life threatening injuries from which she is still recovering.

Witness Kevin Thomas told the court: 'I could see a girl lying in the road and I saw the jeep had gone into the house and the roof had collapsed onto it.

'The driver seemed to me like he didn’t have any regard to what was happening,

'I’ve seen cars speed on that road before but not as fast as that.'

Morgan, of Treharris, near Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, denies dangerous driving.

The trial at Newport Crown Court continues.
