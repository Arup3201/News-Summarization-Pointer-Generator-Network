A pill usually prescribed to treat epilepsy, could give adults the learning powers of a child, according to new research.

Valproic acid, which is a key ingredient in drugs used to treat the disorder, could help adults revert to a more porous state of learning so that they are more able to learn new skills.

The study demonstrated the power of the ingredient by helping a group of adult males learn to become pitch perfect.

The skill, which is only possessed by around one in 10,000 people and enables singers to hit notes precisely, is usually taught from a young age, The Week reported.

However, Takao Hensch, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University, has proved it can be taught to adults too.

He studied valproic acid, which is used to treat a variety of mood disorders to enable adult males aged between 18 and 27 to become pitch perfect.

His real aim was to see if the ingredient can make it easier for grown-ups to learn new skills and absorb information.

'It's a mood-stabilizing drug, but we found that it also restores the plasticity of the brain to a juvenile state,' he told NPR.

The men who took part in the experiment had no musical training as children and were asked to perform online tasks to train their ears.

After two weeks of the exercises, they were tested on their ability to differentiate tones to see if the training had more effect than it typically does for men of their age.

The pill seemingly enabled the group to acquire perfect pitch, suggesting that they had become more open to learning new skills than their peers.

Professor Hensch told the radio station: ‘It's quite remarkable since there are no known reports of adults acquiring absolute pitch.'

In the future, it is possible that the research could help adults learn languages and new skills at a faster speed than is typical at a later stage in life.

However, side effects need to be studied on a cellular level and Professor Hensch warned: ‘it is a process that one probably would not want to tamper with carelessly’.
