A nine-year-old boy who was hit by lightning as he played soccer in August has headed home in time for Christmas.

Alex Hermann's heart stopped when he and two other boys were struck by the bolt on a field in Austin, Texas on August 26. He suffered burns and hypoxia, where the brain is deprived of oxygen.

He was rushed to hospital, where his parents were not sure he would recover. But after showing astonishing signs of recovery and undergoing multiple skin grafts and a cardiac ablation, which corrects heart arrhythmias, doctors said he was finally ready to head home.

On Friday, his family shared an image to Facebook showing him in his wheelchair grinning beside Christmas decorations inside Austin and Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas.

Heading home! Alex Hermann smiles as he prepares to leave hospital. The nine-year-old boy headed home on Friday, more than three months after he was struck by lightning on a soccer field

'Today is the day that we have been waiting for, but Alex has been waiting for it the most!' the family wrote alongside the photograph.

'For over three months, Alex has been working hard to become stronger and healthier by the day. However, he has been terribly homesick.

'It is such a relief to be able to have our whole family reunited to a new 'normal' lifestyle, despite going to outpatient therapy at the hospital, as well as various in-home therapies as well.'

Speaking to ABC News, his father, Roger Hermann, said that his son had been looking forward to hugging his dog, a Catahoula Australian shepherd named Spice, and decorating the tree.

'He made me do it the first day I was home on Friday,' he said. 'He can't move his legs, but he was directing some of the ornament placement.'

He added that Spice is also overjoyed to have Alex home and has been sleeping on his bed and guarding him.

Battle: Alex, pictured with players and a cheerleader from the Texas Longhorns in October, suffered burns and needed skin grafts and a cardiac ablation, which corrects heart arrhythmias

Support: The family thanked friends, family and strangers who sent their good wishes to Alex

Joy: Alex, pictured before the accident, was looking forward to being reunited with his dog, his father said

It is an incredible achievement for the youngster, who was left unable to speak, move, talk or hear after he was struck by the bolt over the summer.

His heart stopped and his parents and a 19-year-old coach performed CPR before paramedics arrived and flew him to the hospital. He spent three weeks at a pediatric burn center in Dallas before moving to Austin and Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas.

Two other boys were also struck but were released from hospital soon after.

Doctors initially told Alex's parents that they could not be sure how well he would recover and the couple feared he was brain dead.

But he began showing astonishing signs of recovery, such as uttering 'Dada' as his father leaned over his bed and smiling when he heard his favorite song.

Scene: The youngster was on this field to play soccer when he was struck by lightning in August. His family is now suing the youth association for $10 million to cover the boy's medical bills 

The youngster still needs extensive therapy and is still unable to walk or form complete sentences, KVUE reported.

Alex's parents are suing the Lake Travis Youth Association for $10 million on claims they were negligent in getting the vulnerable kids off the field amid the approaching storm. 

According to the family's attorneys, his suffering could have been prevented.

'Alex Hermann sustained severe and permanent damages when all of the Defendants failed to comply with the basic safety principles on weather safety when lightning is in the area,' reads the court petition obtained by the Houston Chronicle. 

The family has said they have no intention of hurting the league, but will likely need the money for insurance to help pay for their son's hospital bills and long-term care.
