Ancient forest: Logs and stumps can be seen underneath the thawing 37 square mile Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska, with some of the trees still bearing roots and bark

An ancient forest which is thought to have been hidden for at least 1,000 years has been discovered beneath a melting glacier.

Logs and stumps can be seen underneath the thawing 37 square mile Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska, with some of the trees still bearing roots and bark.

Remnants of the forest have been protruding from the river of ice, which flows into a lake near the city of Juneau for around five decades.

But scientists from the nearby University of Alaska Southeast have noticed more tree stumps popping up in the past year.

The researchers are particularly excited about the discovery because most of the trees are so well preserved with some still in their upright position.

The forest is said to have been shielded from the ice by a tomb of gravel which most likely encased the forest as Initial carbon dating tests suggest that the gravel tomb, which is around 5ft high, may have been formed at least 1,000 years ago.

As glaciers develop they often emit summer meltwater streams which produce aprons of gravel.

Cathy Connor, a professor at the university, told LiveScience: 'There are a lot of them, and being in a growth position is exciting because we can see the outermost part of the tree and count back to see how old the tree was.

'Mostly, people find chunks of wood helter-skelter, but to see these intact upright is kind of cool.'

The trees are thought to be either spruce or hemlock, based on the size of the trunks and existing vegetation in the area.

But while the find has excited scientists, locals are concerned about the prospect of glacial melting.

They are worried about the threat of rising sea levels and the loss of freshwater sources relied upon for drinking water.
