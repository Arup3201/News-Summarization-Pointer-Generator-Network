England’s players are braced for a bruising encounter as they travel to play in Scotland for the first time in 15 years.

Roy Hodgson’s squad arrive in Glasgow expecting to face a confident Scottish side in terrific form under Gordon Strachan.

They also anticipate a physical battle and a hostile reception at Celtic Park after watching Scotland beat the Republic of Ireland 1-0 in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday.

‘They were kicking lumps out of each other, weren’t they?’ said goalkeeper Ben Foster, who is set to replace the rested Joe Hart. 

‘It was very high-tempo. I could feel the atmosphere sitting watching it. It’s almost like they were getting more up for a good tackle, than they were for good passes. 

'I’m sure we can expect the same atmosphere and same sort of game. It will be a good one to be involved in.’

In public, Hodgson has tried to quell the rivalry ahead of Tuesday's game but has warned his squad about the intensity of the fixture and Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere is relishing the idea of a derby atmosphere.

‘It’s not going to be very friendly,’ said Wilshere. ‘It’ll be a bit like Arsenal v Tottenham and Liverpool v Man United but we’re used to that as players.

‘We played them at Wembley a couple of years ago and it wasn’t the friendliest then. They’ll be a bit more up for it on their home ground but we know what we’re walking into and we’ll definitely be up for it.’
