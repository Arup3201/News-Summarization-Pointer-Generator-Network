The Los Angeles Lakers have confirmed that a man shot and killed in Philadelphia over the weekend was the father of player Wayne Ellington Jr.

Ellington Jr. said in a Tuesday statement 'My family and I are devastated by the news of my father’s murder on Sunday night in Philadelphia. We appreciate everyone’s support and ask that you respect the privacy of our family during this very difficult time.'

Police say the 26-year-old basketball player's father, 57-year-old Wayne Ellington Sr., was found shot in the head in the driver's seat of a car in the Germantown section just after 8 p.m. Sunday, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

Ellington was transported to Einstein Medical Center and pronounced dead Sunday evening, according to the newspaper.

No arrests have been reported.

The Lakers wrote online that Ellington Jr. was been granted an indefinite leave of absence. The team said there is no set time for his return. 

Ellington Sr.'s mother Betty Ellington told The Philadelphia Daily News 'I'm devastated. I couldn't even believe this.'

Two parked cars were hit by Ellington Sr.'s car, Chief Inspector Scott Small told the newspaper.

The only ballistic evidence police have uncovered was the bullet hole in Ellington Sr.'s passenger-side door - and investigators believe the bullet likely entered via his driver's-side window, the newspaper reported.

'It was his whole conversation, about his son playing in the NBA,' Betty Ellington told The Philadelphia Daily News, revealing her son was a father to two daughters as well as a grandfather to two granddaughters. 

Mitch Kupchak, the Lakers General Manager, said in a Monday statement 'Our players are upset for their friend and teammate. Additionally, ownership and all Lakers employees are also saddened by this tragedy.Those of us who work with and have gotten to know Wayne have come to know what a wonderful and caring person he is. Our hearts go out to Wayne and his family, as do our thoughts and prayers.'

Byron Scott - the coach of the team - told ESPN on Tuesday 'It was just very sad news, obviously, and all of us have to give him space to grieve and deal with this with his family and we'll welcome him back with open arms when he decides to come back.'

During a walk to his vehicle, Ellington Jr. found out about his father, Scott told the sports website.

Scott told ESPN 'I got the news when I was with my family in the hallway about to go to my car. I obviously kind of dropped everything and went straight to him, spent a few minutes with him. A lot of his teammates were there, as well as his fiancé. [Charlotte Hornets player] Gerald Henderson, who he grew up with, was there. He had a lot of support.'

'Again, this is our livelihood, but it's still just a game,' he also told ESPN. 'This thing that's happening with Wayne is real life. It kind of puts everything in perspective, too.

'As a team, we'll obviously keep going on and trying to win games, but I think all of us, every now and then - during the game, after the game, before the game - will have Wayne on our mind.'
