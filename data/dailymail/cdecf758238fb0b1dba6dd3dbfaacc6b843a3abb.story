The polling station at Hikkim, said to be the world's highest, is gearing up as residents in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh prepare to vote in the regional elections tomorrow.

The small, green-roofed building is located in the Himalayas at some 15,500ft above sea level.

Voters from three villages in the predominantly Buddhist area will cast their ballots at the Hikkim polling centre.

'The Hikkim polling station caters to the three villages of Komik, Langche and Hikkim and has 326 voters,' SS Guleria - senior official in Lahaul and Spiti district, close to the Tibetan border - told the BBC.

The state government recently built a new road that winds its way up the mountain to these remote hamlets but the region can be cut off from the rest of the world for up to half a year due to heavy snowfall.

Night temperatures in the area have already dropped to around -5C (23F).

There's a school and Hikkim also boasts the highest post-office in the world, but there are no telephone lines.

'The election team is equipped with very 
high frequency communication sets, including satellite phones, to 
conduct polling on Sunday' Mr Guleria told reporters.

In total, some 44million voters will be casting their ballots in these elections, at over 50,000 polling stations.

Campaigning ended on Friday.

Local residents said even though none of the candidates have scaled the mountain to visit them, they're still looking forward to the election.

Wealthy: Congress nominee Brij Bihari lal Butail

Contesting an election has become a game for the moneyed class, and those who are without the 'cash power' can just dream.

In a hill state like Himachal Pradesh where resources are meagre and infrastructure is poor, politicians are becoming rich and reaching the Vidhan Sabha (legislative assembly) without hurdles.

According to an analysis by the NGO National Election Watch, more crorepati (ie those worth more than 10million rupees) politicians are contesting elections this time around compared to the last elections held in 2007.

In the 2007 elections, there were only 16 per cent crorepatis contestants. This time they have registered a growth of 17 per cent, making 33 per cent candidates contesting for the Vidhan Sabha.

Brij Bihari Lal Butail, who is the Congress nominee in the Palampur constituency, is worth Rs 169 crore, followed by Balbir Singh Verma, who is contesting the election from the Chopal constituency as an Independent, and owns property worth Rs 41 crore.

Ram Kumar Chaudhary, who is the son of former Congress MLA Lajja Ram Chaudhary and is contesting from the Doon constituency on a Congress ticket, is worth Rs 36 crore.

Congress's chief ministerial candidate Virbhadra Singh is the fourth wealthiest politician, and owns property worth Rs 33 crore.

Rajinder Singh Rana, the former BJP spokesperson who has been expelled from the party for contesting the election against the party nominee from Sujanpur (Hamirpur) constituency, is worth Rs 22 crore.

Kamal Patiyal, who was expelled by the Congress for contesting the election against the party nominee in Dharamsala is also a corepapti and owns property worth Rs 18 crore.

Rajesh Sharma of Kangra and Dharamvir Singh of Kullu, both Congress rebels, also own properties worth Rs 18 crore each.

Interestingly, there are 20 candidates whose property is priced below rs 1 lakh. Om Prakash of HSP from Baijnath constituency has declared the lowest assets, worth only Rs 2,000, followed by Rama Mahendra of HSP from Palampur with assets worth Rs 10,000 and Shiv Kumar of SP from Sarkaghat constituency with assets worth Rs 10,000.

Seventy-nine out of the 445 (18 per cent) candidates analysed in the Himachal Pradesh 2012 Assembly Elections have not declared their PAN (income tax card) details.

In 2007 elections, 169 out of 327 (52 per cent) candidates analysed had not declared their PAN details.

This year too, three crorepati candidates, Vijay Jayoti (IND) from Kasumpti constituency, Tikender Panwar (CPM) from Shimla constituency and Vijay Kumar (SP) from Nahan constituency, have not declared their PAN details.
