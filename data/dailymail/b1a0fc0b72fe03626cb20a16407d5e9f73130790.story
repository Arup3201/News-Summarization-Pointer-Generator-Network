A supermarket has been forced to apologise after a little boy opened a box of cornflakes - and found a condom inside.

Tesco has launched a probe after the little boy tucked into his cereal - bought from a store in Barnstaple, Devon - only to find the unopened contraceptive swimming in his bowl. 

His uncle's fiancee, who asked not to be named, managed to snatch the condom packet away before he could examine it - but says she was soon bombarded with awkward questions. 

The woman claims it came from inside the packet of own-brand Tesco cornflakes.

After she complained to the supermarket giant, she said they offered a £20 gift voucher and a bunch of flowers. 

The woman says she poured a bowl for her partner's nephew, who was staying with them, and turned around to fetch the milk without spotting the condom.

She said: 'He started screaming and there was lots of commotion. I asked him what was wrong and told him to calm down and eat his cereal. 

'Then I looked down and saw something shiny in the bowl. I picked out what I thought was packaging and to my horror it was a condom.

'My boyfriend came in wondering what the commotion was about and saw the condom.

His nephew was still screaming and I was trying to explain that I found it in the box.

'His nephew was shouting 'there is a condom in my breakfast'. Everyone was shocked and my boyfriend was disgusted.'

After the incident the woman took the box to the Tesco Extra store to complain.

She's since received a letter from Tesco apologising for the grim discovery, along with a £20 voucher.

The woman added: 'I told them there was a condom in my cornflakes and the woman put her head down and was really embarrassed. She went and got me a big bunch of flowers.

'I don't want people to think I am after money but they told me in Tesco this is the worst thing they had found. I am stressed about the whole thing.'

A Tesco spokesman said: 'We set ourselves very high standards for the safety and quality of our products.

'Our suppliers have conducted a full investigation and we have provided our customer with a gesture of goodwill.'
