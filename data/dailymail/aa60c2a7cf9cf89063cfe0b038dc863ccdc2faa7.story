'Shocking': An MP has condemned the toll of military dogs put down since 2009

More than 350 retired military dogs have been put down since 2009, figures reveal today.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) put down 42 British dogs due to a "dangerous temperament", while 27 developed cancer-related health problems.

The majority, 117 were put down due to 'age and welfare' reasons while 76 had osteoarthritis.

Four were killed in action in Afghanistan, and a fifth was put down due to injuries from a road accident.

MPs and animal charities have called on the MoD to ensure euthanising elderly dogs is a 'last resort'.

Liberal Democrat MP Tessa Munt said she was 'genuinely shocked'.

She added: 'When the MoD 
invests millions of taxpayers' money on training these animals, it seems
unfortunate that their ongoing welfare is not taken nearly as 
seriously. This is troubling.

'I
have always believed that the way people treat animals says a lot about
them, and I hope that the release of these figures into the public 
domain will lead to greater planning and a more compassionate approach 
in future.'

The figures have been released weeks after it emerged two RAF dogs which guarded Prince William were put down days after he left the service.

Belgian shepherd Brus and German shepherd Blade were put down shortly after the Duke of Cambridge's final shift at RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales.

When the story emerged the MoD agreed to review its 
policy to ensure a military vet and experienced dog handler are both 
involved in every decision to put a dog down.

A spokesman added a further 419 dogs were rehomed between January 2009 and June this year.

A spokesman for the Dogs Trust, the UK's largest dog 
rehoming charity, said it understood most ex-service dogs could not be 
rehomed as pets due to their past.

But he added: 'Deployment to another role or retirement to a 
specialist handler within the service community are two options explored
by the MoD that Dogs Trust would always advocate for healthy dogs.

'The
Dogs Trust never puts a healthy dog down and is opposed to the 
premature euthanasia of working dogs when retired or no longer able to 
perform their duties. We actively encourage specialist rehoming and 
retirement programmes.'

Neil Parish, MP for Tiverton and Honiton and chairman of the Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare, said: 'Dogs employed in our armed services demonstrate commitment to their handlers and bravery on a daily basis and have undoubtedly saved the lives of countless servicemen and women.

'We have a duty of care for their well-being as real as the military covenant.

'I think it is vitally important that we make sure that none of the 117 dogs that were put down because of 'age and welfare' reasons since 2009 were done so out of expediency.'

Military dogs are used as guards and some can be trained to sniff out improvised explosives

Mr Parish added: 'The government has stated that there are no time restrictions on a dog being kept while a suitable home is looked for and I hope that the Ministry of Defence bears this in mind.'

According to the figures, 68 dogs were put down in 2009, 117 in 2010, 84 in 2011, and 71 in 2012. Thirty were put down between January and July this year.

David Amess, Conservative MP for Southend West, said the sheer numbers 'led many to question the motives behind this policy'.

The MoD said 'every effort' was made to rehome dogs, but illnesses caused by old age forced some of them to be destroyed.

A spokesman added: 'The MoD has a moral and legal duty to ensure the welfare of our animals and only put down those dogs that cannot be rehomed.

'We announced in September that we would review our existing policy to ensure that consistency across the MoD.

'Military working dogs play an invaluable role on the front line helping to save the lives of our armed forces and local residents in Afghanistan.

'Dogs are afforded as much protection as possible and handlers are specifically trained to minimise the risks that dogs face in performing their tasks.'
