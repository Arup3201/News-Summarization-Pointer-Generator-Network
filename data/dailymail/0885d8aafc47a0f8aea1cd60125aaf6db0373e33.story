‘I prayed and prayed it would be me,’ said Jonathan Buchanan, 15, from Chandler, Arizona.

He is reminiscing the day doctors tested him to see whether his bone marrow was compatible with that of his twin brothers, Jordan and Josh Buchanan, 16.

The identical twins have sickle-cell anemia, a hereditary disease that affects the red blood cells, and have been suffering through a life of pain every day since they were born.

In June 2012, doctors tested the twins’ three other siblings, including Jonathan, to determine if they were a match and found that the two eldest brothers were not able to donate, according to the Arizona Republic.

But the day came when the boys’ mother, Kristine Buchanan, 44, got the phone call that would change their lives: Jonathan was a perfect match.

‘I was sitting down with a cup of coffee when I got the call, and I just started crying. I didn’t know what to feel,’ Ms Buchanan said. ‘I was like, is this for real?’

‘I had a feeling when my two other brothers were tested and couldn’t do it (that) it would be me,’ said Jonathan.

Only one son at a time could receive the transplant, so the boys played paper, rock and scissors to see who would go first.

Josh won, but Dr Dorothea Douglas, who treats the twins at Phoenix Children's Hospital, decided he should go first anyway, because he was in more pain.

A day before the transplant, Jonathan had to spend the day in an operating room to have the marrow taken from his pelvis.

‘At first I was really nervous,’ Jonathan
said. ‘I had to get all the shots, and I’m kind of scared of shots. But
it got easier once they told me about it. I feel really proud to help 
them get better.’

Josh had his transplant in October 2012, and doctors say he is now cured of the disease.

‘I watched his face change from someone who is angry and always feels pain to someone who is happy,’ Jordan told the Arizona Republic.

Sickle cell anemia causes the boys to live in chronic pain. They played rock paper scissors to decide who would go first, and Josh won. He was also in more pain. Josh received a transplant with his brother's marrow in 2012 and is now cured

The brothers, seen here with their mother Kristine Buchanan, are now in the last phase of treatment. Jonathan bravely had more bone marrow extracted last month and last week brother Jordan received his transplant at Phoenix Children's Hospital

Sickle-cell anemia is a hereditary disease that changes the shape of red blood cells, making them curved, so they cannot deliver oxygen and nutrients as well as normal cells.

In the United States, 70,000 to 100,000 people have sickle-cell anemia, most of them African-Americans, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.

Sickle-cell anemia has caused the boys a lot of pain because the misshaped cells become stuck and can’t move through the body.

The average lifespan for someone with the disease is 35-40 years, Dr Douglas said.

The disease also makes the boys sensitive to changes in temperature and elevation and prone to strokes, joint trouble, organ problems and other illnesses.

‘The quality of life can be poor,’ Douglas said. ‘You’re in pain every day for the rest of your life.’

Jordan said his pain is mostly in his neck and head, and it feels like there is something sharp in his head or a bone is out of place.

Last week, Jonathan donated bone marrow again, this time for Jordan’s transplant.

He said he would donate his marrow a million times, if it would make his brother better.

Jordan began his stay at Phoenix Children’s Hospital on August 25 and will stay for six to 10 weeks.

He slept through most of the nine-hour transplant on September 5.

His hospital room has a TV, an Xbox 360, a MacBook, toys and a stationary bike to keep him busy during the stay.

‘This whole process is utterly a blessing,’ Ms Buchanan said. ‘I’m so grateful for the doctors and nurses at Phoenix Children’s Hospital. They make us feel so welcome.’

Jordan will spend several weeks in the hospital as the new bone marrow multiplies and his immune system recovers from the chemotherapy.

It can take up to 10 days for his body to accept the marrow.

Dr Douglas said Jordan will be uncomfortable as his body recovers, but it will be worth it, because ‘not having pain every day is a real life-changer’.

Jordan is excited and said he is ‘ready for my cells to multiply so I can go home and get back to my friends and family’.

Ms Buchanan will stay with Jordan during the entire treatment; she’s sleeping on a reclining chair in the corner of Jordan’s room, and his brothers will visit often, according to the Arizona Republic.

Jordan will also have to be weaned off the painkillers, just as his brother was.

Dr Douglas said after taking narcotics like Vicodin or Oxycontin their whole lives, they cannot stop taking the medicine cold turkey.

Jonathan is looking forward to playing basketball with his brothers after Jordan’s recovery.

He said Josh has improved in the few months he’s been able to play.

When everything is said and done, Ms Buchanan, who is a single mother, wants to go on a vacation, something she hasn’t been able to do since the boys were born.

‘I want to do something big, and I’ll probably turn off my phone,’ she said
