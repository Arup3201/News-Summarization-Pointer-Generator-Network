As summer kicks into gear, thoughts tend to turn – not unreasonably – to the prospect of a nice cool beer, possibly in a leafy garden in a suitably pleasant pub.

But anyone feeling thirsty in London at the moment should beware the cost of their drink.

Taking care of the pennies: A bottle of beer will cost you a lot more in London or Oslo than in Berlin

According to research, the British capital is among the top five most expensive cities in the world if you want to enjoy a quick hops-based tipple.

The new study, conducted by online travel search engine Go Euro, assessed the average price of a small 33cl bottle of beer (rather than a full pint) in 40 of the world’s biggest cities.

It discovered that those seeking value for money when it comes to liquid refreshment should avoid Norway, Switzerland and Japan, as well as the UK, but might want to consider a weekend trip to Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic or Portugal.

The findings rank the Norwegian capital as the most expensive place to buy a round. A small bottle of beer costs an average of £2.87 in Oslo.

In London, by comparison, the cost is a less steep – but still pricey - £1.72.

Prices are also eye-watering in Zurich (£2.46), Tokyo (£2.45) and Israel’s seafront city Tel Aviv (£1.92) – with these three cities eclipsing London in the top five.

At the opposite end of the table, Warsaw extends an inexpensive olive branch to drinkers, coming bottom (or top, depending on your perspective) of the poll with the average price for a small beer being calculated as a wallet-pleasing 64p.

Other havens for cost-conscious drinkers include Berlin (66p), Prague (75p) and Lisbon (78p), with Dublin (78p), Mexico City (79p) and the Colombian capital Bogota (82p) also managing to keep themselves below the one-pound barrier.

Other big European cities to dodge the one-pound mark included the Hungarian capital Budapest (83p), Dutch metropolis Amsterdam (86p), as well as – perhaps surprisingly – the hub of all things Spanish, Madrid (85p).

Along with Madrid, a couple of other cities spring unexpected results.

Australia 
is famed for its laid-back love of a drink, but a night out will clearly
 have an impact on your bank balance in Sydney, where the average cost 
of a small beer is £1.58.

And
 Rio De Janeiro’s ‘achievement’ in sneaking into the top ten most pricey
 cities for a beer – with an average price of £1.39 – is testament to 
the rising cost of living in Brazil.

‘Beer is popular in every country in the world, and it’s a staple ingredient of almost every holiday,’ says Naren Shaam of GoEuro.

‘In this sense, it is a great way to get a feel for how expensive, or cheap, a city will be for travellers from around the world.’
