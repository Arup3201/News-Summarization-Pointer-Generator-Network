If Jessica Lowndes is pining after her ex-boyfriend Thom Evans, his latest modelling campaign images certainly aren't going to help matters.

Not only does the 28-year-old rugby player-turned-model show off his incredibly toned body as he poses in boxers and briefs, he gets very cosy with a stunning female model.

Shot on the sun-drenched beaches of Barbados, Thom canoodles with Kim Kardashian lookalike, Paolla Rahmeier, in the sea for D.HEDRAL's new campaign.

Daniel Jaems, who directed and shot the campaign, said: 'It's called 'La Sirena' (The 
Mermaid) and like any mermaid, Paolla's plan is to lure Thom into the 
water whilst he's under her spell.

'I wanted to really explore "true love" with this video. Its vulnerabilities and fragility.

'But on the surface, it is to remind everyone of those blissful weeks, months, where nothing makes sense.'

Thom, who has made no secret of his desire to break into acting, leads the film with his narration, describing Paolla as she lures him in and out of consciousness.

The film is to promote underwear brand D.HEDRAL's new store that is launching in Covent Garden, London.

In a bid to lure shoppers in, a billboard size advertisement of Thom in his briefs has been errected.

'People have been walking past and taking all kind of images of themselves next to his larger than life "manhood"', said Daniel Jaems.

Both models showcase the range's figure sculpting swimwear, which is priced at around £82 for a pair of men's briefs and £58 for women's.

Back in October, Thom split up from his girlfriend of seven months, 90210 star Jessica Lowndes.

The Mirror reported
the couple decided to go their separate ways after struggling with the 
long-distance nature of their relationship – Jessica lives in the US.

Speaking about Thom’s split with the 
American actress, a source told the paper: ‘It was a mutual decision and
Jessica and Thom have been on and off for quite a while now. Jessica 
works mostly in America while Thom’s modelling work is in the UK.

‘They have realised it is totally unfeasible trying to maintain a relationship from different sides of The Pond.

‘They
have hardly seen one another of late. They are still friends and 
haven’t ruled out a reconciliation in the future, if things pan out 
differently.’

But it seems that now these images have been unveiled to the world, Thom won't be staying single for long.

Calling time: Thom Evans split from his girlfriend of seven months Jessica Lowndes in October. Form an orderly queue, ladies!
