Five major wards at one of the country's largest hospitals have been shut after an outbreak of the winter vomiting bug norovirus.

Families have been told to stay away at Southampton General Hospital and new admissions have stopped to prevent the infection spreading.

They are the first ward closures to hit this winter as a result of the virus which swept across the country last winter affecting more than one million people.

Visitor restrictions are now in place across the whole of University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Southampton General, Princess Anne Hospital and Countess.

One relative of a patient who turned up at the hospital on Thursday night was told that they could not go onto the ward as it was sealed off.

He said: 'It is worrying to think that this bug is now on five wards. It is difficult when your loved one is on one of the wards affected and we can't go to keep them company but I understand that these measures need to be taken to stop it spreading any further.'

Relatives of patients can only visit if it has been agreed by nursing staff, so anyone planning to visit are being advised to call the relevant ward or department before arriving.
