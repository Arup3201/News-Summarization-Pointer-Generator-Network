Fernando Alonso is convinced success is on the horizon for McLaren on the day when he saw former team Ferrari return to glory.

After missing the season-opening Australian Grand Prix as he recovered from a concussion sustained in a test crash, Alonso's first outing on his return to the team ended in retirement after 21 laps of the Malaysian Grand Prix due to an ERS cooling issue.

As Alonso spoke and delivered his verdict on the weekend when McLaren have at least made some progress, Sebastian Vettel was charging around in the background en route to his first win for 16 months.

The German is, of course, Alonso's replacement at Ferrari as the 33-year-old opted to quit the Maranallo marque after five years without success of trying to claim a third title.

What must Alonso have thought later when he saw Vettel stand on the top step of the podium, the first time a Ferrari driver had done so since the Spaniard himself in his home grand prix two years ago.

Whatever Alonso's thoughts, all he can do now is remain convinced McLaren's early woes in conjunction with new power-unit supplier Honda will ultimately lead to the results he craves.

It is a case of short-term pain for long-term gain as Alonso said: 'These reliability problems are normal.

'What you normally find in winter testing, we have to find in the first couple of races unfortunately. We need to accept maybe some retirements and we are ready to do so.

'Definitely it has been a very nice weekend and a very nice surprise to see the improvements from Australia to here.

'If we keep up this rate then we will enjoy success very soon.'

Overall, Alonso expressed 'mixed feelings' as to how the weekend had unfolded, adding: 'I'm happy to be back and very happy with the progress the team has made.

'Watching the race on the TV in Australia, we were very far off - four seconds in the race and just one McLaren running alone at the back.

'Here we were much more competitive in qualifying, running with everyone in the race, which was a very nice surprise.

'But not finishing the race is never a nice feeling, so let's see if we can improve next time.'

Team-mate Jenson Button retired on lap 42 with a turbo issue, leaving neither of the team's cars classified for the first time since the 2006 United States Grand Prix.
