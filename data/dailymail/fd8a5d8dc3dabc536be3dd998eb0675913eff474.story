Tragic: Sandra Wiltshire, 68, died along with her dog Bruce when they were trampled by cows last year, an inquest heard today

A retired accountant was trampled to death by a herd of cows as she walked her dog, an inquest heard today.

Sandra Wiltshire, 68, died alongside her beloved golden Labrador, Bruce, after the incident in a field near their home in Chippenham in Wiltshire last year.

Mrs Wiltshire was declared dead minutes after paramedics arrived at the scene, while her companion Bruce was put down by a vet later that day.

An inquest in Salisbury in Wiltshire heard the field Mrs Wiltshire and Bruce - who was not on a lead - were walking in had no public right of way and was private land.

The jury ruled that Mrs Wiltshire died as a result of an accident, a verdict recorded by the coroner, with injuries caused by hooves.

A spokesman for the panel told David Ridley, coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon: 'She had been attacked by cattle while walking her dog. Following attendance by paramedics and police she was pronounced dead.'

Mrs Wiltshire mainly walked rescue dog Bruce, described as 'overweight' and 'slow' in fields by the River Avon near their home.

Her husband George Wiltshire, a taxi driver, did not attend the hearing but a statement he had prepared was read.

It said: 'Sandra walked Bruce twice a day every day and enjoying taking him out.

'It kept her fit and energetic. She would take him out to the fields out by the river.

'When she walked Bruce, if they were in the fields he would always be off the lead and would be miles behind Sandra.

'Bruce didn't cause any trouble.'

Mr Wiltshire said he last saw his wife the night before her death, when she looked 'happy and healthy'.

Mrs Crawley, her husband Raymond and their dog Judy had been walking 
around the fields when they spotted Bruce caked in mud, lying on the 
floor.

Around 30 feet away lay Mrs Wiltshire, whose face and hands were covered in mud.

'I shouted out to the person saying "are you alright?",' Mrs Crawley told the court.

'The female voice spoke back saying "no, not really, I have been attacked by cows. I have been here since 7.30.''

Mrs Crawley ran to get help and then returned to Mrs Wiltshire after asking a nearby walker to call 999.

'I saw Bruce the dog lying about 30ft away from Sandra,' Mrs Crawley said.

'I could hear him whimpering. I realised he wouldn't stand up and was covered in mud.

'It was clear Sandra wasn't very well at all. I did think at that moment there was no hope.'

Terrible event: Blackbridge Road in Chippenham, close to where the accident last year took place

The jury was told local people were aware that the fields, part of Rawlings Farm, did not have public right of way.

But the land was regularly used by walkers, despite a sign stating Private Fishing which related to an access path for an angling society.

Michael Franklin, who lived near Mrs Wiltshire, saw her walking Bruce on the morning of the incident last year and said the cows had charged towards him and his dog on two previous occasions.

'I waved and shouted and they stopped in their tracks,' he said.

Paramedics and police attended the field and Mrs Wiltshire was pronounced dead at 8.56am, shortly after they arrived.

Farmer Charles Mifflin said the herd of Simmental cattle that used the field comprised of 16 cows, 14 calves and one bull.

Mr Mifflin, who runs two farms, described the breed as 'very quiet'.

'They are friendly like most cattle, they come up to nose and make friends with you,' he said.

'These are working fields, it is land that is farmed. People don't appreciate that it is a workplace.'

A post mortem performed by Dr Lawrence John, a consultant pathologist at Great Western Hospital in Swindon found

Mrs Wiltshire suffered extensive bruising when she was trampled.

He said: 'One on the right lower thigh was consistent with having been made by a hoof.'

Dr John said the cause of death was multiple blunt traumatic injuries and being trampled by cows.

Speaking after Mrs Wiltshire's death, her mother Brenda Beint of Calne in Wiltshire, said the family was shocked.

Mrs Beint said: 'I cannot tell you how much I miss her.

'Sandra was a lovely, bubbly personality and she and I always enjoyed our time together.'
