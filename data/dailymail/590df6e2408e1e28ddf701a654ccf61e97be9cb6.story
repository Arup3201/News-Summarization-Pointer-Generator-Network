An investigation into a fatal police shooting in Bel Air early Sunday morning is underway after an officer killed 'a fairly crazy' elderly man in the wealthy neighborhood.

The exclusive Los Angeles neighborhood, which is the home to celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston, saw the armed man shot dead at 3:30am.

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrived at the scene after a utility worker, who was working on a gas leak, called officers and reported the man with a gun.

The elderly man, identified only by neighbors as Bob Bandler, had pointed his gun at the utility worker.

Neighbors say they were shocked by the violence, but not surprised to see police at the home because of the man's strange behavior

Bandler was described by a local resident as a 'fairly crazy guy', KTLA reported.

Michael
Dempsey, who lives by the scene, told the news station: 'From time to 
time he'll get fairly nuts and the police will come up and calm 
everything down.

'We never thought much of it. It's just been part of the background of the neighborhood.'

However,
on this night, an officer killed the armed man after he confronted the 
utility worker and then refused to drop his weapon.

A
neighbor of Bandler, Steven Verona, said his neighbor's chef 
'supposedly heard the police say, 'Bob, don't do this'. And then (boom) 
it was over.'

Neighbors 
say the dead man was the son of an elderly woman who lives in Bel Air. 
He had been staying in a guest house at the back of the property.

KTLA reported that the shooting shook up the neighborhood, which is filled with multimillion-dollar gated mansions.

Neighbors told the TV station they 
weren't surprised to see police at the home in question. They said they 
had seen the dead man walking around his mother's property several times
before.

Still, the early morning violence shocked residents of tony Bel Air - which boasts an average household income of $207,000.

'It's
shocking, it's shocking like this could happen on this street. People 
up here aren't known to have guns. People up here aren't known to be 
fairly crazed. People up here don't lose their tempers. People up here 
don't get carried away,' Michael Dempsey told KTLA.

'They just mind their own business and go about life.'

Bel Air became a household name with the 1990s with the Will Smith show 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' about a street smart Philadelphia teenager who tries to fit in the tony Los Angeles neighborhood.

Among the famous past and current residents of Bel Air are Paypal billionaire Elon Musk, filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock and Elizabeth Taylor.
