The 31-year-old reality star and rapper, 35, were pictured arriving at La Villaí restaurant in the French capital - dressed in all their finery.

Kim's estranged husband Kris Humphries 
is said to have made the claims to his now ex-girlfriend Myla 
Sinanaj.

Sinanaj says the NBA star told her many details about the reality TV star during
their short relationship earlier this year, according to TMZ.

And Humphries told Myla that Jenner not only told Kim to make a sex
tape, but also to re-film the original because it wasn't 'pretty 
enough,' the website reported.

The tape Kim Kardashian: Superstar was leaked online in February 2007 - four years after it was made.

Kim was facing more legal woes today - amid reports Humphries's attorneys will issue a subpoena for West to be deposed in their bitter divorce battle.

It comes and Kardashian's legal team subpoenaed Kris' ex-flame Myla to supply information on her relationship with the athlete.

A source told RadarOnline that Humphries's lawyers hadn't initially planned on using Kim's relationship with Kanye as part of their proceedings - but now it's fair came.

The insider told the website: 'The gloves are clearly off now.'

On Sunday, the second part of Kim and her family's interview with Oprah will air on OWN.

In the broadcast Kim says West 'knows everything' about her.

The reality star finds her 
relationship with the rapper - who was left devastated when his mother 
Donda died from complications from cosmetic surgery in 2007 - 
'comforting' because they get along so well and can relate to each 
other's life experiences.

Kim - whose father Robert Kardashian 
died of cancer in 2003 - said: 'It's very comforting to have someone 
that knows everything about you, that respects you, understands, has 
gone through the similar things.

'I can really relate to his mother 
passing. He can really relate to my father passing. I mean, there's so 
many similarities in our life that ... I feel like I'm at a really 
happy, good space.'
