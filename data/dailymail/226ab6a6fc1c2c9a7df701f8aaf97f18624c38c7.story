Disgruntled workers facing the axe were told to 'smile and have fun' in a flash mob style promotional video for the firm that builds James Bond's superyachts.

Sunseeker, which is famous for providing powerboats for  movies starring Daniel Craig, laid off around 240 workers just before Christmas and a further 60 jobs are due to be slashed.

But despite the impending cuts, bosses at the Chinese-owned company in Poole, Dorset, sent a memo to staff asking them to take part in the video to promote the launch of their latest luxury boat.

Sunseeker staff received a memo asking them to take part in a flash-mob style promotional video as the threat of job cuts looms over their heads

Workers were told to 'smile and have fun' as they danced and clapped to the Queen hit We Will Rock You

Staff blasted the company as being 'heartless' and 'insensitive' for asking them to help film the promotional video

The note told disgruntled workers to 'smile and have fun' while clapping and stamping to Queen's hit We Will Rock You.

The video, filmed at the company's base at Poole Quay, will be played at the launch of the Sunseeker Predator 57, a plush 60ft powerboat capable of speeds of more than 35mph.

To add insult to injury, Sunseeker has forked out an unknown sum to hire popstar Nicole Scherzinger to unveil the boat at the London Boat Show today.

The memo to staff, from 'Andrew', asked them to take part in a 'participative group flash-mob style sequence'.

It said: 'We want you to do a right foot stomp, then left foot stomp and clap above your head in time with the rock track We Will Rock You', before signing off: 'Thank you all - smile and have fun!'

Some furious workers refused to be part of the video and blasted the company for being 'heartless'.

One employee who refused to take part said: 'They told us on Monday that everybody has got to go and dance for this video, but a lot of us just said we wouldn't.

'Morale is really low. People don't know what's going on.

'They are getting rid of lots of staff and then they tell us to dance around for a video. It's really insensitive.'

Another employee said: 'Sunseeker is laying people off and at Christmas we were told we have no pay rise but there is plenty of overtime in the new year.

'Then we get told they want us over at shipyard five to do some dancing. It's ridiculous.'

Another said: 'Why do they think people would want to clap and dance around when their future is so uncertain? It's pretty heartless of the company.

'It just shows they care more about ego and self congratulation than empathy for their employees.'

A spokesman from Sunseeker said employees were invited to take part in the filming for the video which will be played at the boat show to launch the new Predator 57 boat.

He said: 'The employees at the factory were invited to take part. No one was forced to do anything.'

In 2013, Chinese property developer Dalian Wanda Group paid £320m for 92 per cent of the firm but in its latest accounts the company plunged into the red, recording a £26million loss on a turnover of £341million.

Managing director Stewart McIntyre stepped down in July last year and in October Sunseeker, which employs about 2,500 people, announced up to 300 jobs would go as part of a 'strategic review' to 'increase efficiency'.

The company said: 'The skilled craftsmen on our shop floor remain key to the business and as expected the restructuring has had minimal impact on our direct boat-building activities.'

Sunseeker International produces a range of 40ft-155ft luxury yachts which are popular with celebrities. Formula One boss Eddie Jordan owns one of its 155 yachts, the largest private motor yacht built in the UK.

Sunseeker yachts have also featured in four consecutive James Bond films - The World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace.
