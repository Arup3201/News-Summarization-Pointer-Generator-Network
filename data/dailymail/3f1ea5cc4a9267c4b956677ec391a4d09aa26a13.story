A mother-to-be went into labour in her old classroom - and gave birth as her former teacher helped her.

Pregnant Leanne Need's waters broke while she was collecting her five-year-old daughter from the primary school she attended as a child.

Another mother noticed Leanne struggling to stand and helped carry her inside where staff made a bed from office chairs, blankets and cushions.

New mother Leanne Need and her family are reunited with the team at Oldway Primary School who helped her when she went into birth in the school playground

It was only then Leanne realised she was back in her old art classroom and that one of the volunteers lining up to deliver her baby was Jane Smythe - her former teacher.

Helped by an off-duty paramedic who just happened to be picking up his own son at the time, Leanne gave birth to a daughter, Callie-Louise, weighing 7lb 11oz.

The impromptu reunion happened when Leanne arrived at Oldway Primary School in Paignton, Devon, to pick up the oldest of her three daughters, Lily.

Leanne said: 'I was walking through the playground to collect my daughter and I suddenly felt my waters break. Everyone was staring at me and I was so embarrassed.

'That's when the pain hit and all of a sudden it went from zero to ten.

'I spoke to one of the mums who rushed me into the a classroom of the art department. It all happened so quickly.

'The parents who were assisting me had taken my leggings down and then put them back up as they thought we had time, but I knew the baby was going to come any minute.

'I had a bit of a shock when I realised one of my old teachers was in the room but I didn’t have much time to think about anything.

'Within about 15 minutes of my first contraction Callie-Louise was here.'

Callie-Louise was delivered by paramedic Andrew Worden and another mum, Sarah Duckett, while Mrs Smythe cordoned off the art classroom to give her privacy.

An ambulance was dispatched from nearby Torbay Hospital, where partner Andy Jones, 24, an Asda worker, was expecting to meet Leanne - but the baby was born before medics arrived at the 700-pupil school.

Leanne added: 'I had called Andy once I started to have contractions, but the pain got too much and I had to pass him on to someone else who told him to head for Torbay Hospital.

Within about 15 minutes of Leanne's first contraction Callie-Louise had arrived

'In the end the baby was born before the ambulance crew even arrived - all thanks to everyone at the school.

'It’s always been very special to me as it’s where I spent my primary school days and where I’ve always planned for my children to go.

'Now it’s even more special. After I gave birth I told a few of the teachers that I was adamant Callie-Louise was also going to go there - I wouldn’t have it any other way.'

Leanne and Callie-Louise are now recovering at home with Andy, Lily and their other daughter of eleven-and-a-half months, Megan.

Proud Mrs Smythe gave her former pupil top marks for keeping cool throughout her ordeal and praised fellow parent Mr Worden for stepping in.

She had last taught Leanne when she was just a seven-year-old girl.

Mrs Smythe said: 'The normal protocol for a medical emergency in school is to call first-aiders to the location as the ambulance is being hailed.

'But this all happened so quickly. Mr Worden was magnificent - calm, reassuring, supportive of Ms Need and all of us.

'He managed a very sudden and unusual situation with utmost professionalism.

'As for Ms Need, with one push and one barely audible whimper, Callie-Louise, was born 15 minutes later at 3:30pm.'

Headteacher Pete Maunder added: 'One minute I got a call that Leanne had gone into labour, the next we have a new pupil.

'I have been here for 21 years and thought I had seen everything, but this is definitely a first. We are all really delighted for the family.'
