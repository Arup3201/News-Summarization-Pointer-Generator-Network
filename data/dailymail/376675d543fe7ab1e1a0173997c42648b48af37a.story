As Big Ben chimed and we celebrated – or mourned – the passing of deadline day at 11pm, the transfer window, as it does, slammed shut.

Only, it didn’t. In fact, it remained wedged open for another two hours. That was long enough for Newcastle’s Hatem Ben Arfa to dive head first through the opening at Hull City, and Radamel Falcao to slip underneath the frame at Old Trafford.

So how does that work? Can we never sleep easy following deadline day again? Is that window always ajar? Sportsmail reveals just how clubs can get round the deadline to sign players...

Deadline day deal: Radamel Falcao poses outside Manchester United's training ground after his sensational loan transfer to Old Trafford

Right, Monday was ‘deadline day’ – but when was the damned deadline?

It is still 11pm. Domestic transfers, however, can be granted an extension until 1am, and international transfers until midnight.

We’re going to need more than that, so can you just sign a player at 11.30pm?

No – a ‘deal sheet’ must be submitted to the Premier League before 11pm. So, in effect, that is still the deadline for all parties agreeing to a transfer and putting their approval to a sheet which says it is going to happen. If the Premier League has this by 11pm then they will grant an extension to finalise all other paperwork.

So no, Louis van Gaal cannot decide at 11.30pm that he still needs a centre-back and start ringing around. He should have done that at 1.30pm…

What else needs to be finalised?

The ‘deal sheet’ is an emergency measure which can only be used after 9pm and no later than 11pm. After that documents such as the contract, the transfer agreement and permission to work in the UK must be submitted.

Why do domestic transfers get an extra hour extra compared with international deals?

The Premier League allows two hours – that is their decision – but international transfers must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight.

What is that?

FIFA’s TMS is an online database to which all information must be uploaded for the transfer to gain international clearance.

So what did happen with Falcao and Ben Arfa?

Falcao was a little different to Ben Arfa in that his deal had been agreed earlier in the day and it just took a little time to complete his medical and other formalities before a belated announcement.

But Ben Arfa was your classic deadline-day dash. We were being kept up-to-speed on the move throughout and there was a little concern at one stage that the extension would pass without all paperwork being submitted.

Ben Arfa left Tyneside at around 7.30pm – taking in the A19 and a traffic jam in York. Meanwhile, a ‘deal sheet’ was being faxed to the Premier League and that allowed the extra two hours to agree the terms of the season-long loan deal once Ben Arfa had finally arrived at Hull’s training ground.

And what about Marcos Rojo at Manchester United?

Rojo’s £16m move from Sporting Lisbon is complete, at least from a footballing perspective. He was given an international certificate by the Football Association and arrived in England last week on a tourist visa to finalise the deal.

But that is where the problem lies. Immigration laws require that those entering the country to work do so with a working visa.

And embassy officials will first look into details of an alleged altercation with a neighbour in Argentina in 2010 before issuing the working visa, as the incident is still being investigated by police.

So Rojo should be OK, but what happened with Manchester City’s John Guidetti at Celtic?

The Sweden striker was set to join the Hoops on loan and had travelled to Glasgow to complete the deal. But the move collapsed just after midnight with both City and Celtic having failed to allow the Scottish FA the time needed to process the transfer. There is, however, the possibility of the SFA appealing to FIFA over the circumstances of the delay.

Too late: John Guidetti leaves Celtic Park after  talks with the club, but his move was not completed

So after all of that, should the deadline not just be 11pm on ‘deadline day’?

The fact that some deals can be completed the following day (i.e. after midnight) doesn’t seem right. Certainly, West Ham chairman David Gold thinks so,  tweeting his agreement with the statement: ‘Am I the only one that thinks there should not be extensions… There is a deadline for a reason’.

Take that up with the Premier League, David. In the meantime, you know where to come for any deadline-day queries…
