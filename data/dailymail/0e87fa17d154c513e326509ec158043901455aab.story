It has been an annus horribilis for British clubs in Europe. Ten clubs from north and south of the border began their European campaigns last year, with dreams of Berlin and Warsaw. But before Easter, all have seen them shattered. Here's how.

Europa League qualifier: Motherwell 2-3 Stjarnan (agg 4-5) - July 24, 2014

Motherwell's European campaign ended before it began with an extra-time defeat in Iceland. Stuart McCall's men led the first-leg tie 2-0 but were pegged back at Fir Park, and Atli Johannsson's 113th-minute goal won it for the minnows.

Europa League third qualifying round: Aberdeen 2-3 Real Sociedad (agg 2-5) - August 7, 2014

After seeing off Daugava Riga and Groningen, Derek McInnes' side lost 2-0 in Spain but were on the brink of a famous victory. Leading 2-1 with less than five minutes to go, Xabi Prieto's penalty and Markel Bergara's late winner stunned Pittodrie.

Europa League qualifier: Hull 2-2 KSC Lokeren - August 28, 2014

They had waited 110 years for continental competition in Hull, but after two ties Steve Bruce's Europa League dream was over before the Europa League group stage had even begun. The Tigers managed a 2-1 second leg victory at the KC Stadium, but the 1-0 defeat a week earlier meant early exile.

Europa League last 32 : Celtic lose 3-4 Inter Milan - February 26, 2015

Ronny Deila's side produced a memorable first leg performance against Inter Milan, but conceded three away goals in doing so. A late Fredy Guarin strike at the San Siro sent 10-man Celtic out of Europe.

Europa League last 32: Liverpool lose 5-4 on penalties to Besiktas – February 26, 2015

Liverpool started their campaign in the Champions League, but looked ordinary against Besiktas in the Europa League round of 32 second leg. Tolgay Arslan's effort sent to tie into extra-time before Dejan Lovren missed the crucial penalty to condem the Red to defeat in Istanbul.

Europa League last 32: Fiorentina 3-1 Tottenham – February 26, 2015

The Spurs faithful had just started to dream of a Europa League and Capital One Cup double when goals from Mario Gomez and Mohamed Salah put paid to another English exit.

Champions League last 16: Chelsea 2-2 PSG – March 11, 2015

Chelsea were the first team in Champions League history to exit the Champions League without actually losing a game. Jose Mourinho's defensive tactics backfired hugely against an extremely talented PSG side, who fought to a 2-2 draw after 120 minutes at Stamford Bridge.

Champions League last 16: Arsenal 3-3 Monaco (out on away goals) – March 17, 2015

The Gunners had it all to do after a shock 3-1 defeat against Monaco at the Emirates. It proved too big a task as goals from Olivier Giroud and Aaron Ramsey left Arsenal one goal shy of a place in the Champions League quarter-finals.

Champions League last 16 : Manchester City 1-3 Barcelona – March 18, 2015

The pressure was well and truly on City and Manuel Pellegrini after being outplayed by Barcelona at the Etihad in the first leg. Things didn't get any better at the Nou Camp as a superb performance from Joe Hart was the only thing stopping an onslaught from Lionel Messi and Co.

Europa League last 16: Everton 4-6 Dynamo Kiev – March 19, 2015

And so, it was left to Roberto Martinez's Everton side to pick up the pieces and fly the flag for English football in Europe. After a 2-1 first leg victory against Dynamo Kiev at Goodison Park, Everton were the narrow favourites to go through to the Europa League last eight and give English fans something to sing for.

Unfortunately for the Toffees faithful, Everton continued the embarrassing trend of crashing out of Europe by succumbing to a 5-2 defeat in the Ukraine giving Dynamo a deserved 6-4 aggregate success.
