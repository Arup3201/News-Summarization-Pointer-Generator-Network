Not many artists could call producing their work a walk in the park - but for Omid Asadi it's just that. 

The 35-year-old, from Greater Manchester, has created a collection of intricate images by carving into fallen leaves with a scalpel and a needle.

His portfolio, which is brimming with portraits of iconic celebrities and beautiful animals, was inspired by an idea he had while strolling in a park with his wife, Elham, 36, two years ago.

He now spends up to three hours-a-day perfecting his methods with his artistic wife occasionally offering some direction.

The artist recently exhibited his work for the first time, which he creates using only a scalpel, a magnifying glass and a needle.

Mr Asadi, originally from Iran, claims he has been approached by a website connected with the Saatchi Gallery and says he wants to show the world that art can be found anywhere.

He said: 'Carving these leaves resonates to my childhood, I had no time for playing football outside.

'So I used to use a needle and make some simple drawings behind a leaf and on a leaf.

 He says 'too many people just see the beauty of this art but I am also trying to tell a story with each leaf'

The 35-year-old creates the designs using a scalpel, a magnifying glass and a needle before pressing the leaves on paper and adding wood glue 

'Two years ago me and my wife were walking in the Sale area and we found some heavy and beautiful leaves and we put them in a book to press them

'About that time I visited a gallery and saw an exhibition on paper cutting - it was then I decided to give these leaves we found another life.

'My wife is a professional artist and she does Persian miniature artwork so she taught me how to use the leaves - the first year I practiced for two or three hours every day.

'Too many people just see the beauty of this art but I am also trying to tell a story with each leaf.

'With my portraits I  I have also tried to give some people who are dead another life.'

The process of carving each leaf can take anything from a few days up to a month (pictured left - an impression of Edvard Munch's famous painting The Scream)

He added: 'The process of carving each leaf can take one or two days or up to one month, I use just two or three tools - a scalpel, a magnifying glass and sometimes a needle.

'I just press the leaves, I don't use any chemical things or anything like that, after I've finished I simply use wood glue and press them on the paper.

'Isaac Newton had the apple falling from the tree, for thousands of years nobody made this connection, the most important message around my work is to look better at the world around us.'  

Mr Asadi, originally from Iran, claims he has been approached by a website connected with the Saatchi Gallery and says he wants to show the world that art can be found even in the most simple places

The 35-year-old's works include this image of a dragon appearing to burst out from a split tree 

The artist said: 'Carving these leaves resonates to my childhood, I had no time for playing football outside'
