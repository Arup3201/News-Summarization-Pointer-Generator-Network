Olympic and Commonwealth gold medallist Greg Rutherford can now add European long jump champion to his impressive list of honours.

Two years on from the high of his London triumph on 'Super Saturday', the 27-year-old has enjoyed quite a time of late.

Earlier this year Rutherford revealed that his girlfriend Susie Verrill is expecting their first child in the same week he was named British record holder, having jumped 8.51 metres in Chula Vista, San Diego in April.

Success: Greg Rutherford wins long jump gold at the European Championships

He overcame injury to triumph at Hampden Park a fortnight ago and secured his place at the top of the long jump podium in Zurich with an impressive leap of 8.29m - 14 centimetres ahead of nearest rival Louis Tsatoumas of Greece.

Given some have suggested Rutherford was lucky to win the Olympics with an 8.31m jump, he was particularly pleased to quieten such naysayers with another gold medal.

'I'm the biggest fluke going,' he said with a smile. 'I keep doing this. It's fantastic.

'It's great to go out there and put out a couple of half decent jumps and have another title. I only took four today.

'I had the luxury of four rounds and leaving it. I had a slight tightening after the fourth and thought I'd wait and see if someone could jump further.' 

Medals: The 27-year-old has also won gold at the Olympic and Commonwealth games

Rutherford was one of three Brits in the long jump final, with JJ Jegede finishing ninth with a best of 7.88m and Chris Tomlinson ending 11th after a 7.75m effort.

Rutherford came to fame in 2012 when he won gold in the long jump at the London Olympics and has since gone on to extend his list of achievements at the Commonwealth Games. 

Great Britain have enjoyed considerable success on the final day of the European Championships.

Mo Farah stormed to victory in the 5000m while Adam Gemili rounded off an impressive 4x100m relay to win the gold.
