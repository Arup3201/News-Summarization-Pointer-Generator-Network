After five days featuring 58 catwalk shows, 57 models, an array of celebrity-saturated front rows and gallons of champagne, London's most fashionable week draws to a close today.

And as the dust settles, trends begin to emerge.

According to some of LFW's most influential designers - including Erdem, Tom Ford, Christopher Kane and Burberry's Christopher Bailey  - it appears that next season's most stylish accessories are... your nipples. 

Bare-all: Models at the Christopher Kane SS15 show proved that less is more 

Sheer blouses, dresses and shirts have been all over the SS15 catwalks.

In some cases, the nod to the nipple has been subtle: at the Burberry Prorsum show Christopher Bailey paired transparent tops with denim jackets to preserve his models' modesty and at Tom Ford models nipples were covered by sequin detailing.

However, at Christopher Kane and Erdem, daring see-through designs gave the models nothing to hide behind.

The fashion for exposed breasts comes hot on the heels of the Free the Nipple campaign.

The 'Free the Nipple' campaign is an equality movement that uses social media and film to fight against censorship laws in the US, where it is illegal in 37 states for women to appear topless.

It has gained the support of celebrities including Rumer and Scout Willis, Cara Delevingne and Rihanna.

Cara  is one of its biggest champions, having been seen in February wearing a 'Free the Nipple' T-shirt, which featured a photograph of a pair of breasts emblazoned across it.

The model has also posted support for the campaign on her Instagram account, re-gramming an image of a flesh-coloured bikini with a graphic nipple pictured on top. 

Cara isn't the only celeb to have adopted the 'nearly-naked' trend.

Rihanna was named 'Fashion Icon' at the CDFA awards where she wore this daring see-through number

At this year's CFDA awards Rihanna, who was named 'Fashion Icon', was the centre of attention at the New York event when she stepped out in a daring, totally sheer embellished halter dress.

The revealing outfit was custom-made by designer Adam Selman and comprised of a total of 216,000 Swarovski crystals. 

Although it has been given the go-ahead from the stars this is sure to be one of the bravest trends to emerge from Fashion Week and when this season's catwalks included models toting guns, that's saying something. 

Will Kate be wearing this? The Duchess of Cambridge is a well-known fan of Emilia Wickstead who also took paid tribute to the transparent trend
