A father-of-four who picked up a laptop from PC World only to find it had a large scratch down the side seconds after leaving the store has hit out at workers who told him it couldn't be replaced.

Dale Covell, 32, said he was shocked when a manager allegedly accused him of scratching it himself - despite having just picked it up from being repaired at the store in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

Mr Covell originally paid £380 for the HP laptop last month but after a number of technical problems, took it in to the Trinity Retail Park store to be fixed last week.

He said he noticed a large mark down the side of his laptop after collecting it but was told by workers that the firm was not responsible for the damage because he had 'stepped outside the store'.

Dale Covell found a large scratch on his £380 HP laptop after collecting it from being repaired at PC World in Bolton, Greater Manchester. The firm initially denied responsibility but has now given him a new laptop (above)

He dropped his relatively new laptop off at the store to be repaired and only discovered the new scratch after collecting it a short time later. He said he returned to the store but staff said it wasn't the firm's responsibility

The finance director said he went back inside the shop to report the problem but was told that because he had left the store, the firm would not accept responsibility for the damage.

He said: 'To say they wouldn't replace it because I stepped one foot out of the door is a disgrace.

'I was still on their land. When a damage report was done on it when I initially dropped it off, the scratch wasn't there.'

However, it appears bosses at the store later had a change of heart and offered him a replacement.

Mr Covell, 32, alleged that a store manager had accused him of causing the damage to his laptop himself

PC World has since apologised to the father-of-four and has given him a replacement higher-spec computer 

A spokesman for Currys & PC World said: 'It is unfortunate that Mr Covell feels he had a poor experience in our store.

'We offered him several like-for-like replacement laptops as well as the option of a slightly higher-spec model. Mr Covell opted for the latter.

'Great customer service is at the heart of everything we do.'
