Conservative MPs have stepped up a row with Britain’s leading aid charity over its ‘misleading’ assault on the Government’s austerity programme.

Ministers are understood to share anger at Oxfam’s campaign accusing the Government of creating a ‘perfect storm’, including ‘benefit cuts’ and ‘unemployment’, which it suggested was fuelling hardship in Britain.

Oxfam insisted it had a ‘duty’ to highlight hardship in the UK, but Tories branded its attack a ‘disgrace’ as official figures showed another record increase in the number of people in work.

They have lodged a complaint to the charities watchdog claiming the campaign breaches laws barring charities from political campaigning.

Oxfam’s campaign involves a mock film poster showing a raging sea and black skies, carrying the slogan: ‘The perfect storm... starring zero hours contracts, high prices, benefits cuts, unemployment, childcare costs.’

Conservative MP Priti Patel, a member of the Number Ten policy advisory board, said: ‘Oxfam are behaving disgracefully by misleading the public about Government policies and their political campaigning may be in breach of their charitable remit.

‘They have shown their true colours and are now nothing more than a mouthpiece for left wing propaganda.’

Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: ‘It is sad, when a charity doing such great work abroad to alleviate poverty, becomes embroiled in politically partisan attacks in an attempt to compete with all the other head-in-the-sand left-wing groups and grab a few headlines”

Political commentator Tim Montgomerie, former chief of staff to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, said: ‘I won’t be giving to Oxfam again. I want to help the poorest people of the world, not finance left-wing politics.’

Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative MP, accused Oxfam of engaging in an overtly ‘political’ that was not borne out by the facts.

‘My concern is that charities should walk the walk - helping make a difference to people at the front line - not talk the talk - engage in advertising or political campaigning. They should make a difference to people in their daily life,’ he said.

‘I think we can all see the messaging here and what Oxfam is intending to say. My bigger concern in many ways is that a lot of it is not accurate; we have got a government that is reforming zero-hours contracts, we have seen unemployment fall by 400,000, we have seen inequality - the gap between the rich and the poor - falling, we have seen relative poverty falling, and we have seen food poverty falling according to OECD figures.’

Tories also pointed to Oxfam’s links to the Labour Party, notably through its honorary treasurer David Pitt-Watson, who was appointed general secretary of the Labour Party in 2008, but did not take up the post.

Mr Pitt-Watson was Labour’s finance director from 1997 to 1999. Jo Cox, a former head of policy at Oxfam, has been selected as a Labour candidate at the next election and is chair of the Labour women’s network.

Ben Phillips, Oxfam’s campaigns and policy director, defended the advert, arguing the campaign was not political and that the charity has a duty to draw attention to the hardship ‘suffered by poor people we work with in the UK.’

‘Fighting poverty should not be a party political issue,’ he added.

The Charity Commission said it was considering a complaint about the campaign to determine whether a full-scale inquiry should be launched.
