Marie Margaret Sloan is accused of 'a catalogue of misconduct' during her four years as care manager of The Sisters of Loreto's north Wales branch

A foul-mouthed convent nurse referred to frail patients as being a 'pain in the arse' and locked a staff member in a room with a dead body, a panel was told today.

Marie Margaret Sloan is accused of 'a catalogue of misconduct' during her four-year spell as care manager of The Sisters of 
Loreto's north Wales branch.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in Cardiff heard Ms Sloan also mistakenly gave a
 Sister the wrong tablets and suddenly stopped one elderly woman's 
prescription before telling a colleague she had smuggled the 
stockpiled drugs into South Africa for her ill brother-in-law.

Ms Sloan began working at The Sisters of Loreto in Abbey Road, Llandudno, in 2008, after bosses decided to create a new position for a care manager.

The facility is a former boarding school, but is now described as a 'spiritual retreat' and offers residential places for up to 20 Sisters.

Finance manager Gareth Maloney said while the facility was not a care home as such, officials expected Ms Sloan to put her previous nursing experience to good use.

Explaining her specially-created post, he added: 'In the job specification we wanted someone who was a Level 1 registered nurse.

'Previously when we had agency staff we would have to take residents to the doctors for simple things (such as giving injections or checking their blood pressure).'

However, concerns about how capable Ms Sloan was for the job amid claims about the chaotic way she carried out her duties prompted auditors to carry out an inspection in 2012.

'They (the drugs) were in the staff room in a drawer and in some cases on top of the cupboard,' Mr Maloney added.

'There was a long list of tablets and ointments dating back three to four years.'

Mr Maloney said Ms Sloan's defence at the time was 'it's a convent not a care home' - remarks which he said he had been 'shocked' by.

The NMC panel also heard details of a conversation between Ms Sloan and a staff member regarding a woman known as Patient A.

They heard how Ms Sloan took it upon 
herself to 'no longer give Patient A a drug' that she was on because it 
was making the woman 'fall over and was not doing any good'.

Once the drugs had stopped, they continued to be prescribed and a stockpile was built up.

The
 panel was told: 'The registrant [Ms Sloan] stated she was going to take
 the drugs to South Africa for her brother-in-law who had the same 
condition as Patient A.'

A staff member warned Ms Sloan against stock-piling the drugs, saying it 'was drug smuggling' and she 'might get caught'.

When care home bosses questioned her about the remarks, Ms Sloan claimed that she had only been joking but appeared agitated when the matter was brought up during a disciplinary.

Mr Maloney remarked: 'She was physically in a state of shock. Her actual words were: "I can see where this is going".

'At the time I did not know what to believe. She said it was a joke, but then where were the tablets?'

Four charges - containing 15 allegations - were read aloud to panel chairwoman Christine Castledine at today's hearing in the NMC's offices in Cathedral Road.

As well as claims of failing to manage medication properly, Ms Sloan was accused of failing to provide 'appropriate management'.

It said she failed to respond to concerns about 'a member of staff attending work under the influence of alcohol' as well as 'staff threatening violence towards another' and allowing a patient to light candles in her room beneath a wooden shelf.

It was also alleged she made 
inappropriate comments about her patients, including saying 'they are 
all bonkers' and 'I ain't f****** taking that woman again because it's a
 pain in the arse'.

'Marie regularly swore and used to call the sisters witches. They were far from that. They were lovely and incredibly sweet old ladies who had dedicated their lives to helping others'

                               Housekeeper Luci Watson

The panel also heard evidence about the sudden collapse of Patient A in the dining room.

Housekeeper Luci Watson said when it was discovered the woman had in fact died, the door to the room was locked - despite a cleaner called Maureen still being inside.

Mrs Watson said: 'She was locked in the room for quite a long time. Considering she was just the laundry lady with no nursing training that was totally inappropriate.

'I would have been petrified if I had been locked in the room with a dead body. Why did she lock the room? So nobody else could get in I presume.'

Mrs Watson also claimed the Ms Sloan was not qualified to do the job, and was only employed because she knew someone else who worked at the convent.

She added: 'She had no respect for the sisters at all. They were being totally neglected. And if a member of staff wanted to talk to her in confidence she would open her mouth to the next person and it would be around the home anyway.

'Her office was not used as an office. It was an open room where she was constantly sat on the computer.'

Mrs Watson told the panel she regularly found pills and tablets on the floor. 'Obviously the sisters were given them but they weren't taking them,' she said.

'They were put on the table in a plastic cup and just left there. Nobody stood or watched the sisters take their medication.'

Mrs Watson said: 'Marie regularly swore and used to call the sisters witches. They were far from that. They were lovely and incredibly sweet old ladies who had dedicated their lives to helping others.

'Considering Marie was a religious person she wasn't a very good Christian.'

The panel also heard that the registrant remained as care manager until her dismissal in May 2012.

The NMC's four-day hearing is expected to resume tomorrow.
