Controversial: Dr Daniel Potter runs a clinic in the US which allows couples to choose the sex of their baby in treatment costing £7,600

Increasing numbers of British parents are flying to the US for a controversial IVF treatment which allows them choose the sex of their baby, a leading expert has revealed.

Dr Daniel Potter, who runs the largest fertility clinic on the West Coast of America, has delivered 750 babies to UK mothers since he started in 1997.

Visits from UK women have risen by 20 per cent year on year to the IVF specialist, which allows them to choose the sex of their baby using a process currently banned in Britain.

Dr Potter says he sees around ten patients a month from the UK for his £7,600 treatment, with 80 per cent of potential parents opting for a girl and 20 per cent a boy.

The fertility guru is now visiting the UK for the first time to discuss so-called 'gender selection' and meet some of his 'miracle babies' at his first ever UK patient reunion.

A pioneer in Gender Selection, IVF and fertility, Dr Potter believes in parents' reproductive freedom to choose the sex of their child.

He hopes his trip to the UK will help make those seeking a boy or girl aware that it is possible to choose the sex of their child.

He said: 'I'm here to educate the British public on gender selection, explain the process and address some of the misconceptions surrounding the treatment.

'With more and more of my patients coming from the UK, I wanted to meet people face to face and explain that gender selection is a tested, trusted resource available to families.' 

The treatment process, which takes two weeks, involves husbands and wives flying out to his clinic by Newport Beach, California, to provide samples.

One couple who used the clinic, named only as Hayley and Greg, visited Dr Potter because they wanted a daughter after having two sons.

After a failed gender selection attempt at a fertility clinic in Cyprus, Hayley flew out to LA for treatment with Dr Potter after speaking to him on Skype. She is now six months pregnant with her first daughter.

She said: 'I'd always wanted a little girl but logistically, we didn't want lots of children, we only wanted three, so we thought we'd go down this route.

'My husband said "you can have one more baby" at which point I said, "if I'm having one more I'll make sure it's a girl".

'I just think I've always wanted a mother-daughter relationship - not to take away from what I have with my sons, which is lovely.

A sample is taken from the couple and a series of embryos are made from the samples to make sure they are healthy.

Genetic markers in the embryo indicate whether the baby will be a boy or girl and, as a result, the desired sex will then be implanted into the mother.

The remaining embryos are then either frozen for future pregnancies, disposed of or donated to other parents, depending on the wishes of a couple.

The process is popular in the USA, with one in 10 IVF cycles performed there are now carried out for gender selection.

'We knew 
about gender selection from a TV programme and Googled it. We found a 
website with a message board with a lot of people from the UK who were 
doing it.

'Of
 the eggs we created, we had six healthy embryos - three girls and three
 boys. I still can't quite believe it, I'll believe it when she's here."

The
 couple spent a total of £22,000 on the treatment. The practice of 
gender selection is illegal in the UK under the 1990 Human Fertilisation
 and Embryology Act, and its 2008 amendments.

It
 rules that a license to assist in reproduction 'cannot authorise any 
practice designed to secure that any resulting child will be of one sex 
rather than the other'.

It also forbids 'the testing of embryos for the purpose of establishing their sex'.

However, UK law does allow provision for gender testing in the case of gender-related serious physical or mental medical conditions.

Dr Potter defended the practice against critics who believe nature should decide the sex of a baby or fear selection will lead to a sex imbalance in the UK population.

He said: 'Internationally, the genders selected vary, with boys and girls selected roughly equally.

'Many couples choose to donate any remaining healthy embryos anonymously.This way, they can be adopted and made into a baby, potentially transforming someone's life.'
