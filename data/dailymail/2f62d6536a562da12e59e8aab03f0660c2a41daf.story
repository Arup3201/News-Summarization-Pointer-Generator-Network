The owner of a restaurant flooded by the devastating tidal surge last week ripped up the carpet in his eaterie and replaced it with straw in a bid to get back in business.

Richard Pye had to act swiftly after his new restaurant, Daisy's Urban Farm Kitchen, was submerged under two feet of water when the storms battered Lowestoft, Suffolk.

He led staff in a 24-hour clean-up operation and was able to reopen for dinner on Saturday.

Mr Pye said he wanted to re-open his restaurant 'as quickly as possible' following the floods

Mr Pye, who fears he has suffered damage worth £8,000, said: 'I just wanted to get open as quickly as possible.

'All my ingredients are locally sourced so I felt I could use anything related to farms.

'Everybody has been really nice and positive about it.

'Somebody said it was like being in a Nativity play and people keep asking where our animals are.'

Lowestoft was one of a number of places badly hit by the storms last week following the worst tidal surge in 60 years.

Thousands of people had to be evacuated from the east coast of Britain before the surge hit overnight on Thursday.

A major clean-up operation has been under way after 1,400 homes were flooded, including 300 in Boston, Lincolnshire, alone, according to Environment Agency (EA) figures.

David Cameron yesterday visited Norfolk to see for himself the extent of flood damage following last week's storm.

In Wells-next-the-Sea, the Prime Minister met the residents of homes devastated by a tide which reached the highest level for 60 years.

Dozens of businesses were flooded in Wells and nine homes were damaged, despite sea defences which prevented the situation getting worse.

Smaller communities along the north Norfolk coast suffered even more - in the village of Hemsby, three coastal bungalows fell into the sea.
