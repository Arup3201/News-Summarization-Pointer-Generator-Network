President Barack Obama is teeing off his Martha's Vineyard vacation with his favorite pastime - golfing. But he had a rough start, as reporters - given a rare glimpse of the president's golf game - watched him overshoot the first hole by about 15 feet.

He then missed his first putt and reacted by leaning 
back, kicking his knee up and letting out an 'Ooooh.' His next putt was also a miss and his third finally made it in the hole.

Obama hit the Farm Neck Golf Club for his first outing of a weeklong stay on the exclusive Massachusetts island where he arrived Saturday afternoon. The course is open to the public and overlooks Nantucket Sound.

The president was golfing Sunday with
aide Marvin Nicholson, White House chef Sam Kass and Robert Wolf, a 
Wall Street consultant who has advised him on financial matters.

Obama
regularly vacations on the island, but is staying for the first time at
the $7.6 million Chilmark home of Chicago pal David Schulte.

The
White House says Obama plans no official public appearances but will 
receive daily briefings on national security and domestic issues.

Getting
on the plane from Orlando the Obama's sported a smart look with the 
President donning a suit and Michelle Obama meticulously attired with 
pearls and a belt around her sun dress.

However,
when the first couple disembarked in Martha's Vineyard they were ready 
for their vacation to start, as Obama had changed into a pair of chinos 
and Michelle ditched the pearls and belt.

The First Family have been 
vacationing on the Vineyard for years, but this is the first time they 
will stay at the luxury four-bedroom Chilmark House designed by 
architect Rick Sundberg.

With
wall-to-ceiling windows, the 5,000sq ft home has stunning views over 
the ocean, as well as an infinity pool, tennis courts and a half 
basketball court.

Half the cost of the President's holiday is met by the taxpayer, and the Obamas pay for the remainder, although they have met the full cost of the vacation home, which is owned by private equity expert David Schulte, according to Bloomberg.

Mr Schulte contributed to both of the President's election campaigns and his run for the Senate.

It is not known how much the Obamas paid
to stay at the house, which was found for them by their broker who 
specializes in finding vacation homes for prominent politicians and 
royalty who have specific security needs.

He has previously found rentals for the Clintons and also found the Blue Heron Farm where the Obamas previously stayed for years, until it was sold to a British architect for $22.4 million.

A property expert in the town of Vineyard Haven told MailOnline that Chilmark House would 'likely run in the $40,000 to $60,000 range for the eight-day stay.'

It is estimated the cost of the entire vacation, including the 75 rooms booked at a nearby hotel for staff and security, could reach $2 million.

The Obamas' vacation home is on the 
south coast of the Massachusetts elite playground, which is favored for 
visitors who need extra security.

At the entrance of the home, which 
was built in 1961 and renovated in 2006, is a giant bolder left by a 
retreating glacier in the Ice Age, according to Sundberg Kennedy Ly-Au 
Young Architects.

A guest house set in its nine and a half acres of gardens could be used by secret service agents, who will accompany the family.

With the President's approval rating at 46 per cent, according to Gallup, there has been criticism that his decision to vacation in such an elite spot is insensitive, according to the Huffington Post.

When he was seeking reelection last year, he skipped the family's usual vacation, but this year he plans to play golf with friends and relax with Michelle and his daughters.
