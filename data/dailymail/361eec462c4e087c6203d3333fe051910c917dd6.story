Children with asthma may be using medicines that do not  work, and in some cases could increase their suffering, a new study has shown.

The inhaler, often the first line of treatment in asthma, could be less effective or may even make the condition worse for some children carrying a particular gene, according to research at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School.

Its chairman of paediatrics, Professor Somnath Mukhopadhyay, said: ‘Both asthma reliever and controller medicines may not work well in a proportion of children.

The inhaler could make the condition worse for those carrying a particular gene, researchers say

‘A simple test can identify those who might benefit from a switch to an alternative, more effective medicine.’

The news comes just weeks after it was revealed that exposing newborn babies to germs could help prevent asthma as they grow up.

According to the 'hygiene hypothesis', exposure to bacteria is necessary to prime the immune system early in life.

The findings bolstered the theory that modern obsession with hygiene and cleanliness has driven a boom in allergies and health problems.

Many scientists believe that modern society, with its mania for sanitation and easy access to antibiotics, makes children hypersensitive to harmless allergens.
