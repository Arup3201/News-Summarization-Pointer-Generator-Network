Millions of motorists face traffic misery today as the summer holidays begin and families hit the road.

Fourteen million cars are expected on major routes, and drivers are being warned to expect jams.

Heavy congestion is likely to hit main routes to the coast in the south west of England, at cross-Channel ports like Dover and at major airports.

Hotspots include the M25, the A303 through Hampshire,  Wiltshire and Somerset and the M5 from Bristol to Exeter. 

Those following the M3, M27 and A31 to the Dorset coast could also face problems.

In the North, there will be congestion on the M6 through Staffordshire and Cheshire into Lancashire at peak times.

Lured by special deals, millions of people headed to Britain's major airports to catch some overseas sunshine, leading to departure lounges becoming clogged up.

Heathrow Airport is expecting 1.4million holidaymakers to take off between today and Sunday.

More than
124,000 passengers are predicted to fly from the airport on Sunday alone.

- The A303 from the M3 through Hampshire, Wiltshire and Somerset

- The M5 from Almondsbury near Bristol to Exeter

- The M3/M27/A31 from Winchester in Hampshire to the Dorset coast

- The M6 between Junction 11A through Staffordshire and Cheshire into Lancashire

Terry Morgan,
acting chief operating officer at Heathrow, said: 'We're looking forward
to a very busy summer at Heathrow and hope that the family-friendly initiatives
such as dedicated family lanes and children's play area will take the load off
parents and get holidays off to a flying start.'

Travel
organisation Abta said around 2million people will be heading overseas this
weekend.

It said a
quarter of a million are expected to fly from Gatwick, 135,000 from Stansted,
210,000 from Manchester, 65,000 from Birmingham, 26,000 from Leeds Bradford and
70,000 from Luton.

Spain is
still the British holidaymakers' favourite destination, with the Balearic and
Canary Islands also seeing a lot of tourists.

Meanwhile Turkey, Tunisia and
Egypt are offering great value holidays, Abta said.

Mark
Tanzer, Abta chief executive, said: 'This weekend is one the busiest of
the year as families head off overseas for a well-earned summer break.

'This
year, traditional favourites in the Eurozone like Spain and Portugal have
bounced back after two tough years, with customers taking advantage of some of
the lowest day-to-day expenses overseas.'

However despite downpours blighting 
much of Britain for the past few days, the sunshine looks set to arrive 
in the nick of time.

A
bright and dry weekend is on the way for most of us, pushing away the 
heavy showers which have turned this week into a washout for many.

The
best of the weather will be on Sunday, with temperatures soaring to as 
high as 23c (73f) in the West of England, Wales and Scotland.

Although the South West will be 
basking in the sunniest spells, the rest of us will also be tempted out 
to finally enjoy a touch of summer in what has been a disappointingly 
cool July.

Before that, 
however, some will have to put up with a patchy outlook tomorrow.

The North of England is forecast to be bright and dry but cooler winds 
and isolated showers mean the South will have to wait just a bit longer 
to banish the chill and rain.

Forecasters said the more settled weather should then continue for most of next week.

Advising motorists this morning AA 
patrolman of the year Keith Miller said: 'Allow extra time for your 
journey and, if you can, avoid travelling at peak times. Carry plenty of
drinking water, food and things to keep the children entertained.'

The Highways Agency urged families to plan their journey and to check traffic and weather before setting off.

Road
safety minister Mike Penning said: 'For many people, this will be the 
longest car journey of the year, often on an unfamiliar route, and we 
want to help them to avoid spoiling the start of their holiday.

'A
few moments checking traffic conditions before you set off could take a
lot of stress out of the journey. There are also plenty of ways to 
check for updates whenever you stop for a break, which you should do 
every two hours.'

In Somerset this afternoon a lorry crashed leaving the driver sitting on top of his cab, not daring to move a muscle in case the truck plunged into a ravine

The lorry smashed through a wall and was left balancing precariously on the edge of a road above a sheer drop into the ravine in scene reminiscent of the hit film The Italian Job starring Michael Caine, where a coachload of gangsters and their gold bullion balanced on a clifftop.

Emergency crews arrived at the scene and found the trucker perched on top of his cab, too scared to move in case the slightest tremor sent the vehicle crashing into the ravine.

His lorry had jack-knifed on Bath New Road in Radstock and came to rest teetering over the edge of the hill.

Amazingly the driver, who has not been named, walked away with just cuts and bruises after being plucked to safety by Avon Fire and Rescue Service.

An eye witness in Coombend, a road that runs below the scene of the incident, who did not wish to be named, said 'We heard a huge bang, went outside and looked up and there was the lorry hanging over the edge of the hill.

'Parts of the wall came away and at first we thought it was outside our building.' The drama began at 9.15 this morning and blocked the A367 in both directions.

The road is likely to remain closed until late this afternoon because a crane is being brought in to remove the lorry.

Police have put diversions in place and are appealing to drivers to avoid the area.
