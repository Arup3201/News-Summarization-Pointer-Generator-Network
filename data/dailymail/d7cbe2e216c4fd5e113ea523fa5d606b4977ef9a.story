Radamel Falcao glanced over and, seeing his number was up, started trotting over in the direction of the dug-outs. As one, Old Trafford stood to rapturously acclaim their new hero.

The Colombian was up and running, off the mark for Manchester United with, they all hoped, the first of many, many goals for the club.

And history suggests we'll be seeing many more of these ovations in the remaining months of the season.

It took the on-loan Colombian striker until 62 minutes into his fourth match for Man United to get off the mark

For Falcao specialises in gluts of goals. Wherever he has played, he's scored. And when the goals start to flow, they really start to flow. Falcao is a binge goalscorer.

It takes just one goal to get him going and it could then be weeks and weeks before there's a game in which he fails to find the net.

His match-winner against Everton was a little fortunate. Angel Di Maria's mis-hit shot came directly to his feet and then instinct took over for a close-range finish. But that's all he needs and he departed the action for James Wilson on 73 minutes with the loud cheers ringing in his ears.

Louis van Gaal knows all about Falcao's record and will now expect another glut to begin when United travel to West Brom after the international break.

The United fans have already taken the prolific Colombian striker to their hearts

'He needed that goal,' the Dutchman said afterwards. 'He is a player who will normally make a goal every match and he has had to wait so long.

'I can understand that but now he has scored it will be better after the international break.'

Van Gaal has every reason to expect fireworks. At the start of last season, Falcao went on a sequence of seven goals in seven matches for Monaco.

The season before, when at Atletico Madrid, there was a sensational spree of 13 goals in eight games at the beginning of the season and another of seven goals in eight towards the end.

During 2011-2012, his run of 12 goals in 12 matches in a hectic March and April helped Atletico to Europa League glory.

Some of the striker's best sequences: 

MONACO

2013-2014: 7 goals in 7 games

ATLETICO MADRID

2012-2013: 13 in 8

2011-2012: 12 in 12

PORTO

2010-2011: 16 in 9

2009-2010: 8 in 9

And in his debut season for Porto, in 2009-2010, a sequence of eight goals in nine matches early on helped establish him as a hero.

The following year, his incredible haul of 16 goals in nine outings during the run-in helped Porto to a league and Europa League double.

Falcao is capable of scorching sequences of scoring and everyone of a United persuasion will hope he's about to embark on another.

In fact, the international fortnight could have come at an inconvenient time as the striker seeks to build his momentum.

Falcao's goals will be needed as United attempt to keep up with Premier League pace-setters Chelsea. With Wayne Rooney suspended for the next two matches and Robin van Persie not in the best of form, they need Falcao to put them away.

His track record suggests they won't be disappointed.
