Wendy Davis’ attempt to build her campaign to become the first Democratic Texas governor since Ann Richards in 1995 around her personal story of success against the odds has experienced somewhat of a hiccup - after it emerged that some of the facts have been misstated.

Speaking in a recent federal lawsuit she said that she ‘got divorced by the time she was 19 years old... after I got divorced, I lived in a mobile home park in southeast Fort Worth’.

It turns out that she was in fact 21 when she got divorced from a man called Frank Underwood and only lived in the mobile home for a few months.

Shortly afterwards she relocated to an apartment with her daughter, according to the Dallas Morning News.

She has also blurred the funding of her education.

Her official website states that she attended Texas Christian University ‘with the help of academic scholarships, student loans, and state and federal grants’ and went on to become ‘the first person in her family to earn a bachelor’s degree, graduated first in her class, and went on to Harvard Law School’.

All that is true, but what’s omitted is the significant financial contribution her wealthy husband, lawyer Jeff Davis, made.

He helped pay her Harvard tuition fees, even taking out a loan to do so.

When this omission was put to her, she said ‘it was community resources, we paid for it together’, according to The New Yorker.

This blurring of biographical details has led to Davis stating that improvements need to be made.

She said: ‘My language should be tighter.’

Davis’ became a household name, both in the U.S. and abroad in June last year, when, wearing pink running shoes, she tried to filibuster a sweeping anti-abortion bill for 13 hours, but fell less than two hours short.
