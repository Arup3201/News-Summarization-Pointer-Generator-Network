For anyone who felt awkward as a teenager and desperately wanted to be popular like the ‘cool kids’ at school, a new study may seem like poetic justice.

Scientists have found that teenagers who act cool in early adolescence are more likely to experience a range of problems in early adulthood, compared to their geeky peers.

Children who are revered at school, for example, are more likely to have alcohol and drug problems, become involved in crime, and have problems in relationships.

These include alcohol and drug problems, committing crimes, and having problems in relationships

Researchers recently claimed that 'cool kids' are just as likely to get bullied as unpopular children - and that the consequences could be greater for them.

The study found that the bullying of popular children is an 'invisible crime' as many refuse to acknowledge problems for fear of ruining their standing.

They also found becoming more popular both increases the risk of getting bullied, and worsens the negative consequences of being victimised.

The University of California, Davis, study found that popular children feel they have further to fall.

The study found that the risk of being bullied increases as adolescents climb their school's social ladder - up until they approach the very top, when the risk plummets.

The students at the top, approximately the 5 percent most popular kids in school, sit just above the fray, possibly because their extremely high status puts them out of reach of any rivals.

According to a decade-long study by researchers at the University of Virginia, cool teens who seek out popularity and attention by acting older their age, may not yield the expected benefits.

Such characters are often seen in teen films and are epitomised by James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause and by the four central characters in Mean Girls.

Researchers followed 184 teens from age 13, when they were in seventh and eighth grades, to age 23. Along the way they collected information from the teens themselves, as well as from their peers and parents.

The teenagers attended public school in suburban and urban areas in the south eastern United States, and were from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds.

Teens who were romantically involved at an early age, engaged in delinquent activity, and placed a premium on hanging out with physically attractive peers were thought to be popular by their peers at age 13. 

But over 
time, this sentiment faded and by 22, those once-cool teens were rated 
as being less competent in managing social relationships, by their once geeky peers.

They
 were also more likely to have had significant problems with alcohol and
 drugs and to have engaged in criminal activities, according to the 
study.

‘It appears that while so-called cool teens' behaviour might have been linked to early popularity, over time, these teens needed more and more extreme behaviours to try to appear cool, at least to a subgroup of other teens,’ Joseph Allen, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, explained.

‘So they became involved in more serious criminal behaviour and alcohol and drug use as adolescence progressed.

These previously cool teens appeared less competent - socially and otherwise - than their less cool peers by the time they reached young adulthood.’
