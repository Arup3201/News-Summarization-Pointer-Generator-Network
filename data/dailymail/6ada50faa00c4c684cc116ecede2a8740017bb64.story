The Obama administration has enlisted the help of the mothers of celebrities to encourage young Americans to sign up for health insurance.

The mothers of Adam Levine, Jonah Hill, Alicia Keys and Jennifer Lopez were all featured in a new ad released on Friday by the White House.

The ad comes as the March 31 deadline for enrolling in health insurance rapidly approaches, and young Americans have been some of the slowest to act.

Enlisting the moms: The Obama administration is trying to encourage young voters to sign up for heath care before March 31 so they avoid a tax penalty

In order for the Affordable Care Act to function as it was designed, the administration banked on having a significant number of younger- and generally healthier- Americans enrol to help offset the costs of their elders.

The latest report by the Department of Health and Human Services revealed that only 25 per cent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 have signed up, and the Economist estimates that 40 per cent would need to in order to allow the system to work.

'Young people feel invincible and until something actually happens, they will continue to feel invincible and unfortunately things do happen,' said Patsy Noah, Adam Levine's mother.

This is the second video push aimed at young voters this week, as President Obama sat down for a mock interview with Zach Galifianakis on Between Two Ferns.

Jonah Hill's mother Sharon Feldstein and Adam Levine's mother Patsy Noah laughed about how their 'rambunctious' sons and warned how people feel invincible when they're young

Fun with their sons: Mrs Feldstein accompanied Jonah to the Oscars earlier this month while Mrs Noah is seen with Adam at a Lakers game in 2009

That video took the viral route, with the President and the the Hangover star trading barbs.

Today's video went for the softer approach, with the moms reflecting on their celebrity children before they were famous.

Mrs Noah called her son 'rambunctious, mischievous, naughty' and Jonah Hill's mother Sharon Feldstein painted the picture a bit more clearly by telling how he 'flooded the elementary school' and 'would lie on top of my dashboard and literally not get up'.

'Seriously, do you want your mothers to have a nervous breakdown? You need health insurance, it is imperative that you have health insurance,' said Mrs Feldstein, who recently accompanied her son to the Oscars.

'Taking care of yourself so your mothers can sleep after all they've done for you is not too much to ask in my opinion.'

Alicia Keys' mom Terria Joseph said that because her daughter 'only had to hear a song once and she could play it so she never thought she had to practice'.

Gymnast or singer: Jennifer Lopez's mother Guadalupe Rodriguez said that her daughter's physicality as a child made her think she would be an athlete later in life

Close to mom: Jennifer Lopez brought her mother to a Bafta event held in Los Angeles in 2011

Guilt trip: Mrs Obama capped off the video by pointing viewers to healthcare.gov

Jennifer Lopez's mother Guadalupe Rodriguez said that her daughter was very active and started walking at 8 months and climbing out of her crib by her first birthday.

'At one point I thought "Well maybe she should be a gymnast,"' Ms Rodriguez said.

The video finished with Michelle Obama driving the point home.

'We nag you because we love you. Go to healthcare.gov and enroll today,' Sasha and Malia's mother said.
