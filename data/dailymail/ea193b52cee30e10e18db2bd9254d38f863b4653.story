Mystery surrounds the diaries of Doris Lessing after the late Nobel Prize winner’s will stipulated they remain closed to the world as long as any of her children are alive.

The novelist had a tangled sex life and often difficult relationships with her offspring, and her unusual decision has prompted speculation over the diaries’ contents.

Lessing died aged 94 in 2013, leaving an estate worth £3 million – a striking fortune by any standards, but especially for someone known for her lifelong communist views.

The firebrand anti-apartheid campaigner and former Communist Party member also stated in her will, drawn up in 2009, that her diaries should remain sealed to her longstanding friend, the novelist Jenny Diski.

Only her authorised biographer will be given access. Lessing requested the role be given to Sir Michael Holroyd, but he told The Mail on Sunday he is now too old at 79 to undertake the book.

Sir Michael said of the diaries yesterday: ‘It may well be she thought they might be distressing for others, and she saw no point in that.’ He said he had not read them but conceded they may well contain revelations or observation about her family or sex life that could be upsetting.

The book could take ‘the best part’ of ten years to complete, he said, and another biographer would be appointed. Sir Michael said the writer would have no restrictions and would be able to publish the biography because extracts from the diaries would be put into their wider context.

Lessing, who wrote 54 books and became the oldest ever recipient of the Nobel prize for literature in 2007, did not say whether her biography should only be published after the death of all her children.

Last night Ian Patterson, the 66-year-old husband of Miss Diski, said: ‘I think she wrote her thoughts about everything and didn’t want people to know. She was a cantankerous old woman.’

Lessing had an uneasy relationship for many years with her two eldest children John and Jean from her marriage to civil servant Frank Wisdom, which lasted from 1939 to 1943 while she was living in Rhodesia. She walked out on him, later claiming she had to escape ‘the intolerable boredom of colonial circles’, and left her two young children to live with him, although they became reconciled with her in later years. John, a coffee farmer in Zimbabwe, died in 1992.

She also had a sometimes strained relationship with Miss Diski, a school friend of her son’s, after allowing her to move into her home as a ‘waif’ at the age of 15.

Lessing’s sex life was colourful by 1940s and 1950s standards, with affairs during her two marriages and several relationships as an unmarried mother, including one with the Amer-ican writer Clancy Sigal.

Lessing, who lived in north London, left £100,000 to Jean Cowen, 71, who is her only surviving child and lives in Cape Town, and similar amounts to Miss Diski, 67, and a friend Christopher Couch. Ms Cowen said yesterday: ‘My mother lived a long, very complex life. She was the most extraordinary human being.’

She added: ‘[Her will] does not reflect her great generosity towards many people, including myself, during her lifetime.

‘I and other family members have long known she was a diarist, and that access to her diaries would be stringently limited for a long time. That is not too difficult to live with.’
