Burt Reynolds has strongly denied speculation that he is facing financial ruin and claimed he is selling his personal memorabilia collection because his house has become a shrine to himself.

More than 600 items, including his 1998 Golden Globe for Boogie Nights and the red jacket from Smokey and the Bandit, are being sold this month in Las Vegas.

However, the 78-year-old has said he is not bankrupt saying, 'I want everyone to know that contrary to what all the news outlets are saying, I am not broke.

"I have been in the auction community for 25 years and I've never seen an opportunity like this," Museum of Television president James Comisar recently told ET.
