These dramatic pictures show a group of Syrian rebels using a makeshift catapult to attack government forces.

The primitive weapon appears to have been constructed using a metal road sign and elasticated cord.

Two men at a time operate the catapult on the deserted streets of Aleppo, one holding the frame while the other stretches the cord before releasing the homemade explosive.

Ferocious revolt: The rebels use what weapons they can make or find against government shelling, in streets strewn with rubble

Bitter feud: Bashar Assad's government has ignored the international envoy's call for a ceasefire, with no sign of respite 19 months into the fighting

The rebels have become increasingly resourceful over 19 months of civil war in the troubled country as they fight tooth and nail to bring down President Bashar Assad's regime.

The Syrian army, meanwhile, has been responding with artillery shelling and even banned cluster bombs, according to an international human rights group.

Tens of thousands of citizens have fled over the border into Jordan to escape the horrific violence, with activists claiming that more than 33,000 Syrians have now been killed.

Tensions are also escalating with Turkey, which wants to ban Syrian planes from its airspace because one was seen transporting weapons.

The Syrian government said today that the international envoy's call for a four-day holiday ceasefire would likely fail because the rebels fighting to topple Assad's regime have no unified leadership to agree to it.Â 

The envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, had asked Iranian officials to help broker a truce during the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, which falls later this month.

Syria's state-run Al-Thawra 
newspaper, a government mouthpiece, said today that the biggest obstacle
to the truce was the lack of an authority to sign for the rebels.

'There
is the state, represented by the government and the army on one front, 
but who is on the other front?' the paper asked in an editorial.

All
international efforts to end Syria's civil war to date have failed. 
Both rebel and government forces have disregarded previous ceasefires, 
and the many rebel units fighting to topple the regime have no unified 
leadership. Many do not communicate with each other.

Brahimi,
the joint U.N.-Arab League envoy, arrived in Beirut today for talks 
with Lebanese officials on how to resolve the crisis as part of a 
regional tour.

Syrian 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdessi said in statement to the state
news agency that the government was waiting for Brahimi to come to 
Damascus to convey to officials there the results of his tour. It would 
welcome any 'constructive initiative,' Makdessi said.

It was unclear if Brahimi would travel to Damascus from Beirut.
