Police and army bomb squads were called to a third suburban home in four days today as another military collector was arrested for keeping a stash of wartime guns, grenades and ammunition.  

Police raided the address of the 37-year-old, not yet named, in the village of Little Linford, Buckinghamshire, and discovered dozens of historic First and Second World War munitions.

Controlled explosions were carried out at the semi-detached home, which had been sealed off by police searching for artefacts illegally dug up with the help of metal detectors and removed from heritage sites across Britain and Europe.

A house in Little Linford, Buckinghamshire, was the latest house to be raided by police today as part of an operation targeting military collectors

The operation comes after two other military collectors were arrested in raids this week in St Albans, Hertfordshire, and Bicester, Oxfordshire by police cracking down on heritage crime.

All three men were said to be among a group of enthusiasts and hobby collectors who tour former military sites in Britain and abroad looking for memorabilia.

Hertfordshire Police, which is leading the probe, first raided the home of married father-of-two Alan Tissington, 48, on Wednesday and discovered a huge haul of bombs, artillery shells and a Vickers machine gun dating back to the First World War.

Several controlled explosions were carried out by soldiers from the Royal Logistics Corp in a farmer's field two miles from his semi-detached home in the heart of suburbia.

Mr Tissington was held on suspicion of theft and possession of firearms, explosives and ammunition, and later bailed pending further inquires.

The following day saw 35-year-old Daniel Mackay's home raided in Bicester, Oxfordshire, where officers made similar finds.

Army bomb experts performed controlled explosions in his back garden. He too was arrested on suspicion of theft from heritage sites and later bailed.

Mr Mackay and Mr Tissington know each other through their hobby and have communicated with each other on Facebook. 

Mr Mackay was pictured on his profile wearing Army fatigues and posing with a machine gun, among his other finds.

He also features in a macabre YouTube video shared by Tissington in June, entitled 'Exhumation of German soldiers in 2014 Kurland'. 

Mr Mackay is referred to as a military archaeologist in the video and is seen taking part in a dig at German war graves, which were believed to be in Latvia.

Referring to the latest raid, a Thames Valley Police spokesman said an unnamed 37-year-old man from Little Linford was arrested on Friday on suspicion of theft from heritage and protected sites.

Alan Tissington's property in Hertfordshire was also raided by police who found a cache of firearms and ammunition in the garage

Arranged against the far wall of the garage housing the memorabilia was a collection of artillery shells

Hand grenades, shell covers, incendiary bombs, and stick grenades were among the munitions discovered in Wednesday's raid

He was questioned overnight and was released on police bail until November 11, pending further inquires.

Detective Sergeant Pete Frost, who was leading the case for Hertfordshire Police said: 'I can confirm that the Thames Valley incidents are linked to our investigation and the warrant that was executed on Wednesday in St Albans.

'Our investigation is ongoing and we will continue to liaise with Thames Valley Police and partners in English Heritage.'

Supterintendent Jim O'Ryan, deputy area commander for Milton Keynes, added: 'An investigation is in progress in relation to the discovery of First and Second World War munitions at the property in Newport Pagnell.

'Experts with the relevant expertise are working together to deal with these items safely and any controlled explosions will pose no threat to the general public, who should not feel alarmed.'

Sources close to the case said the men regularly visit European battlefields and ex-military sites in the UK with metal detectors.

Mark Harrison, National Policing and Crime Advisor for English Heritage, said: 'The practice of illegal metal detecting or stealing artefacts from the ground, particularly from conflict sites relating to the First and Second World Wars, is an issue that English Heritage takes very seriously.

'We recognise that the majority of the metal detecting community comply with the laws and regulations relating to the discovery and recovery of objects from the land.

'We are prepared to take action and do what is necessary including, working alongside the police, to bring those responsible to justice.' 

Army explosive experts carry out a controlled explosion after evacuating a suburban street in St. Albans - where military collector Alan Tissington was arrested on Wednesday

Alan Tissington - the collector arrested on Wednesday - took to Facebook over the weekend to thank well-wishers.

He wrote: 'Guys, just wanted to say a massive thank you, to all who have sent kind words and well wishes, it is greatly appreciated. 

'Those of you that know me, know I am passionate about military history and militaria, which started at the age of seven.

'I am devastated that part of my life's work has now been destroyed, bearing in mind that the vast majority was purchased at respected military fairs and eBay. 

This Vickers belt-fed machine gun was among the items seized by police at Mr Tissington's house

'I would like to thank Hertfordshire police force, who have been absolutely amazing to myself and my family at this very stressful time.' 

The police raids saw enthusiasts start an online petition on Change.org calling for 'amendments and concise rules for the ownership/sale of military artifacts in the UK'.

The petition, started by fellow collector Simon James on Friday, said: 'To: government stop making old war relics a crime to own.'

It had been signed by 90 supporters by this afternoon.

Michael Clayton, of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, signed the petition and commented: 'This is a legitimate interest and hobby, no different from Government sponsored museums and collections.

'How would the recent WW1/WWII commemorations have been fully undertaken without many private collectors willing to share their items to educate the public? The government, surely, has better things to concentrate on?'
