A newly married couple from Florida ended up calling on a few favors from staff at a waste dump after accidentally throwing away their wedding rings

Saira Rossy from Naples had only been married a few days. She was taking out the trash and simply didn’t realize that her wedding and engagement rings were in a small Ziploc bag next to an empty pizza box.

In her rush to get to work, she ended up throwing them down the garbage chute but she didn't for several hours that the ring was actually missing.

Throwaway love: Newlywed Saira Rossy ended up calling on a few favors from staff at a waste dump after accidentally throwing away her wedding rings

A nice sparkler: Saira Rossy had only been married a few days and was running late for work when ended up throwing away her wedding rings along with the trash

Long road to freedom: The trash wound its way down the garbage chute along with the rest of the household garbage leading directly to a 20-foot-long and 8-foot-wide trash compactor

Helping hand: Waste Management assured her they could help

'I called my mom to see if I had left it in the bathroom and it hit me — oh my God, I threw out my wedding ring,' Mrs Rossy said to NBC 2 News.

Mrs Rossy got married at the start of May and would take her wedding ring set off while she was at work to keep it safe.

Somehow, before her ring made it into her purse for safekeeping, the engagement ring and wedding band wound up on the table next to an old pizza box.

Before long, it was winding its way down the garbage chute along with the rest of the household trash leading directly to a 20-foot-long and 8-foot-wide trash compactor.

In a hurry: Saira Rossy didn;t realize what was in the small Ziploc bag next to an empty Little Caesar;s Pizza box when she dropped it down the garbage chute in her rush to work

Needle in a haystack: Waste Management emptied five tons of trash from the compactor and went digging for the rings

Suited & booted: She made a quick stop at the store; Rossy bought a hazmat suit, mask and boots. She was ready to go Dumpster diving

Found! Dennis Sierra, a driver with Waste Management, found the rings - they were still in their ziplocked bag

After realizing her gut-wrenching mistake, Mrs Rossy called the building manager but he was on vacation.

'I was frantic,' Rossy said. 'I called Waste Management to see if they would let me open it up and look inside, but they understandably said it was too much of a liability — that it was too toxic and it could crush me.'

Eventually. Christi Epperson, a manager at Waste Management told her that although they couldn’t open up the trash compactor, they might be able to take a look inside when it was hauled off a week later to be emptied at the landfill.

Very few people were involved in the actual search.

Recovered: Sierra who looked inside a nearly empty bag with a pizza box on top. He pulled apart every piece of junk mail inside until a tiny plastic bag with a wedding ring inside fell out

The couple even stopped throwing garbage down the chute so there would be fewer bags to sort through.

'It was kind of tragic for us, because we just got married and it was such a large expense,' Mrs Rossy said. 'I really was already thinking there was no way they were going to find it.'

On 'dump day', five tons of garbage filled the container and Mrs Rossy together with  Ms Epperson and Dennis Sierra, a driver with Waste Management, were ready to start looking for the ring.

The search was done mostly by sight because of the risk of encountering needles and broken glass.

Mrs Rossy knew she had to look out for a white trash bag carrying a Little Caesar’s Pizza box.

Driver, Mr Sierra looked inside a nearly empty bag with a pizza box on top and found a tiny plastic bag with a wedding ring inside.

Mrs Rossy bought the two employees $50 gift cards to a restaurant as a thank you.

'I didn’t know what else to do,' Rossy said. 'It’s just so nice that a company would do this, they were extraordinary to do this.'
