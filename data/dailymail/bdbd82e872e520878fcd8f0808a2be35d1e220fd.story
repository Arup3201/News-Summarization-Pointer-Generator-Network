Victim: Saad al-Hilli was gunned down in his car last year

French police investigating the massacre of a British man and his family in the Alps are furious at their UK counterparts for not allowing them to bug the prime suspect – the dead man’s brother.

The reluctance of the UK authorities to sanction the hacking of phone calls and other communication involving Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, has led to a rift which has compromised the inquiry.

Revelations about the dispute came as the French prosecutor co-ordinating the investigation, launched his most outspoken attack yet on Mr Al-Hilli, who denies any involvement.

Making it abundantly clear he still considers the accountant to have been involved in the crime - despite the paucity of evidence against him - prosecutor Eric Maillaud said Mr Al-Hilli was driven by ‘a feeling of hate and vengeance’.

Mr Al-Hilli has, in turn, accused Mr Maillaud of displaying racism towards him because of his Iraqi Muslim background, claiming he is trying to frame him to protect a French killer with influential connections.

It was Mr Maillaud and his colleagues who, more than a year ago, first urged the British to monitor all of Mr Al-Hilli’s telephone and computer communication.

They were convinced he played a part in the murder of his brother Saad, 50, on a remote road in the Alps in September, 2012.

Saad was gunned down along with his wife Ikbal, 47, and his mother-in-law Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74. French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, was also murdered in the ambush close to Lake Annecy.

The Al-Hillis’ seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, was shot in the shoulder while her sister Zeena, four, hid underneath her mother’s skirt in the back of the family’s BMW.

Denail: Zaid Al-Hilli denies any involvement in his brother's death

Zaid Al-Hilli was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder in January and is currently on police bail.

One of the reasons the British finally agreed to arrest him was because  of an alleged series of phone calls to Romania.

‘There has been no movement on this side of the inquiry at all,’ a senior investigating source based outside of the UK told The Mail on Sunday.

‘Things could have been very different if we had been able to tap the suspect early on, and possibly catch him out.’

Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, British police and security services need a warrant, signed by the Home Secretary, before they can initiate a phone tap.

Mystery: The scene of the killing in the Alps last year, which was believed to target the al-Hilli family

Restrictions on hacking are less stringent in France and Mr Maillaud has always made it clear that he wanted to see Mr Al-Hilli, who lives in Chessington, Surrey, arrested as soon as possible.

He said: ‘If Zaid Al-Hilli was living in France he would have been interrogated and probably taken into custody because that’s a technique we use.’

In his latest interview on Friday, Mr Maillaud revived the theory that Zaid was involved in a bitter dispute with Saad over their father’s will.

Referring to Zaid Al-Hilli, Mr Maillaud 
said: ‘It’s true that he presents an interesting profile as he is 
animated by a feeling of hate and vengeance.’

Road: Mr Mollier and the al-Hillis were killed by an unknown assassin near Lake Annecy

Zaid is convinced that cyclist Mr Mollier was the real target of the killer – but Mr Maillaud refuses to contemplate that possibility, insisting that Mr Mollier was merely an unlucky passer-by.

None of the forces involved in the investigation – which include both Surrey and the Metropolitan Police – would discuss the bugging claims, or tensions between officers, because of ‘operational reasons’.

There were more claims about the Al-Hillis released by French prosecutors last week.

They said Saad Al-Hilli had a ‘heated’ argument with an unidentified person at the campsite where the family were staying the night before he was killed.

Next week, E-fit images of a motorcyclist and the driver of a BMW seen at the time of the killings will be released by the French. They are based on descriptions provided by local forestry workers.
