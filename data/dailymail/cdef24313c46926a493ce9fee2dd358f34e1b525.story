DJ Dave Lee Travis faced a media scrum as he arrived at court to face 11 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault against nine alleged victims.

Arriving at Westminster Magistrates' Court, the 68-year-old, whose real name is David Patrick Griffin, refused to comment on the case against him.

He said: 'I'm not protesting anything, I've got nothing to say. I'd like to speak for three hours to everybody to tell you the story. I'm making no comment.'

a grey suit, white shirt and patterned tie, he spoke to confirm his 
name and date of birth, and to query what the next hearing would 
involve.

As he left after the short hearing, he told reporters inside the court building that he could not talk about the case.

He said: 'I either talk for a long time or I don’t, and at the moment I’m not talking.'

Addressing reporters outside court, 
Travis added: 'I am supported by my wife and friends. My wife is not here
today and the reason that she is not here today is because I detest 
hare-coursing.'

Travis has denied any wrongdoing since he was first arrested on 
suspicion of sexual offences last November.

When prosecutors announced the charges, his lawyer Martin Bale released a statement to say: 'Mr Travis is naturally disappointed that charges have been preferred and we will be taking stock of the position in the coming weeks once we have full details of the prosecution case.

'Mr Travis denies the allegations and looks forward to having the opportunity to clear his name.'
