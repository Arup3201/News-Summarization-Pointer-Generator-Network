Jay Z has opened his 40/40 Club at the world's busiest airport – perfect for passengers with time to kill.

The rapper, who is married to Beyonce, launched his elite bar’s third location, which is only open to ticketed flyers at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia.

The sports bar is in the US airport's Concourse D concessions area, and will be a scaled-down version of his two other clubs.

40/40 restaurant and lounges also are located in Manhattan and the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Jay Z also had clubs in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, New Jersey, but both closed.

40/40
 is known at the New York locations for its live music and sports 
memorabilia and for attracting sports celebrities and music stars such 
as Rhiannon, Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne.

‘It's the airport version of the 40/40 Club.’

Airport concessions director Paul Brown said there are plans to create a VIP lounge area of the club, separate from the sports bar - at 1,500sq-ft - on a different floor.

The lounge is expected to open in the late fall, Brown said.

The original Manhattan location opened in 2003, with Jay Z and business partner Juan Perez.40/40 was named after the rare feat among ballplayers of hitting 40 homers and stealing 40 bases in one season.

At the time, Jay Z said: 'I love sports and wanted to create an environment that is conducive to match my lifestyle, while watching the games at the same time.

'When we were thinking of a name, we wanted something exclusive - the 40/40 Club in baseball is as exclusive as it gets.'

The New York club, which has recently undergone a $10m renovation, boasts an 18ft-tall illuminated champagne tower, plush lounges with leather seats, and video walls for watching sports games.

There are also private lounges with billiard tables, 55-in HD TVs, chandeliers and a valuable collection of sports memorabilia.

'We tried to create a place that would be favourable to both men and women, and we think we have found it with the combination of sports and an upscale hip lounge,' Juan Perez added.

Jay Z, Beyonce and Solange Knowles were yesterday pictured for the first time since the now infamous elevator bust-up at the recent Met Gala.

It is unclear what exactly caused the altercation between the rapper and his sister in law.
