The UCI will publish the Cycling Independent Reform Commission's report into whether the world governing body was complicit in past doping practices on Monday.

The investigation centred on the UCI's dealings with doping findings and allegations during the late 1990s and early 2000s, including its handling of claims against Lance Armstrong, who has since admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs.

A statement on uci.ch read: 'The Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC) report has been delivered to the UCI president (Brian Cookson).

'The UCI will publish the report in the early hours of Monday, March 9, 2015. Until then, we will not make any comment on the report.'

CIRC was a key part of Cookson's campaign pledge ahead of his election as UCI president in September 2013. Last month the Briton warned of some 'uncomfortable reading' ahead.

'We should all prepare ourselves for that,' Cookson said. 'When you open a can of worms, you find a lot of worms. It's going to be very interesting to see.'

He also promised transparency, where legally possible. He added: 'We're not going to get into a FIFA-type situation of arguing about the report.

'If they want to redact anything, they can redact it. They may well give us some unredacted information as well, but the report that they give us will be the report that they say is able to go into the public domain.'

CIRC was established in January 2014, with its terms of reference announced the following month.

CIRC is independent from the UCI, chaired by Switzerland's former state prosecutor Dick Marty and included Peter Nicholson, an Australian who has investigated war crimes for the United Nations.

Professor Ulrich Haas from Germany, a specialist in anti-doping rules who works for the Court of Arbitration for Sport, is the third person on the commission.

The key to the commission's success may hinge on whether Cookson's predecessors agreed to give evidence.

Pat McQuaid, the UCI president from 2005 to 2013, has declined to comment either way when asked if he had spoken to CIRC by Press Association Sport.

Hein Verbruggen, who was UCI president at the time of the Armstrong's seven Tour de France wins, was accused of helping to cover up a positive test by Armstrong, but has consistently denied the allegations.

Armstrong stated in an interview with the BBC last month that he had given evidence to CIRC, although whether it reveals anything new or more than the United States Anti-doping Agency report which led to his downfall remains to be seen.

CIRC has the power to reduce sanctions, but whether Armstrong has done enough to see his life ban from competitive sport lessened remains to be seen.

Chris Froome, the 2013 Tour de France champion, this week revealed he had spoken to CIRC.

'I sat down with CIRC after the end of the season last year and spent a good few hours with them, just talking about the state of the sport and how, from a rider's point of view, they can try to improve on things,' Froome told the Daily Mail.

'I think the sport is definitely making a lot of headway in trying to improve its image and and putting the past behind us'

Whether the CIRC report does enough to leave the past behind in a sport which is still beset by doping remains to be seen.
