At least 44 people died and dozens more were injured when an overcrowded bus fell off a clifftop in Guatemala and plunged 650 ft into a ravine below.

The Guatemalan government declared three days of national mourning after the crash which happened around 40 miles northwest of the capital Guatemala City yesterday.

Firefighters said that 38 people died at the scene of the crash including six children and a dozen women.

At least three of those killed were reportedly babies.

Officials say that the bus was carrying around 90 people when it fell into the ravine, despite only having an official capacity of 54.

Early investigations suggested that the driver of the bus, Yony Cumar Cana, who died in the crash, may have lost control on a bend.

Residents of the closest town San Mart√≠n Jilotepeque gathered at the crash scene as rescue workers began retreiving bodies from the scene.

Mayor Otto Vielman said: 'From what we see, the bus crashed against a wall of rocks first and then fell over the cliff.'

Many of the passengers on board are said to have been vendors taking farm produce to sell at a market in the city.

Around 46 passengers were taken to hospital for treatment.

Rescue effort: Hydraulic equipment was used to cut some of the survivors from the wreckage of the bus, say rescuers

Probe: Early investigations suggest that the driver of the bus, who was killed in the crash, may have hit a wall before the bus careered off the cliff

Grieving families gathered outside a recreation center near the accident site where authorities set up a makeshift morgue to identify the bodies of the passengers.

spokesman for the volunteer fire department, Mario Cruz, said: 'Some of the people were rescued with hydraulic equipment, and others were thrown (from the bus) at the time of the accident.'

The route is made up mostly of dirt roads that wind through steep mountains without guardrails or other safety measures. The mayor said a similar bus accident in 2000 on the same road killed 40 people.

The last major bus crash in the country occurred in 2008 when an overcrowded bus slid off a highway and down a 50ft slope 40 miles southeast of the capital, killing 53.

Recovery: Rescuers winch a body across a nearby river on a stretcher

Overcrowded: The bus was carrying around 90 people when its official capacity only allows for 54, officials said
