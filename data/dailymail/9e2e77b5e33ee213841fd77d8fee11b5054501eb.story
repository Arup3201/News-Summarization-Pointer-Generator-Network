Finger pointing: Dr Helen Moss, who was the hospital's director of nursing from 2006 to 2009, was cleared of any wrongdoing at a private disciplinary hearing this month

Almost 70 medical staff who faced disciplinary action after 1,200 patients died needlessly at Stafford Hospital have already been cleared in secret hearings, including the most senior nurse at the height of the scandal.

Helen Moss was director of nursing from 2006 to 2009 when care reached 'appalling' standards, yet has been told she has 'no case to answer' and is now working as a management consultant.

In the last few years 29 nurses and 38 doctors from Stafford Hospital - 67 in total - were cleared at private hearings that considered complaints that will never be made public.

The allegations, made by police, the public and other medical staff, were all thrown out at an early stage, so regulators refuse to publish the details.

A report by Robert Francis QC published yesterday highlighted the 'appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of patients' in Stafford, as the Prime Minister revealed that nobody has been struck off or disciplined for their part in the biggest NHS scandal in history.

The sick and vulnerable were left for hours sitting in their own urine and excrement,
drink was left out of reach forcing them to glug water from vases and hygiene was so poor that relatives had 
to clean toilets themselves.

Julie Bailey, whose mother Bella died in 
harrowing circumstances at Stafford Hospital, says she has been 
inundated with complaints from others from all over Britain about about 
NHS standards.

Speaking about the lack of disciplinary action following the scandal she told the BBC: ‘I’d like to say I was surprised, but I’m not. This is how the NHS is. It is one big roundabout where they get on, fail, and then get on somewhere else.

‘Those in charge then (at Stafford) have already gone, resigned and gone to other jobs with huge pay packets.

‘The chief executive was so unwell he couldn’t give evidence to the (Francis) Inquiry, but he has made a mockery of it because he is now working for another organisation in the area.

‘We need radical action. We need leaders in the NHS. Something has gone terribly wrong and unless we make a stand now we will lose the NHS. Just rewarding people for failure cannot continue.’

Targets: This wall in Stafford is adorned with names campaigners blame for poor standards, including current head of the NHS David Nicholson and head of nursing Helen Moss

Victims: Face after face of those who died at Stafford are pasted on the wall along with details and tributes

Upsetting: The pictures not only show the dead but also the painful injuries they received when they were supposed to be cared for

In total, 29 nurses who worked at Stafford Hospital during its darkest days have been cleared of wrongdoing in private 'Investigating Committee' hearings held by regulator the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

Under pressure: NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson is refusing to resign despite calls for his head

This is the first stage of the process which decides whether there is a case to answer.

Two individuals have been cleared in public, with ten more still facing charges at future hearings.

Meanwhile 42 doctors were referred to the
General Medical Council during the scandal, but only four face a public
hearing.

Figures given to MailOnline show 22 doctors were given 'advice’ but no punishment, and 21 were told they had no
case to answer.

Healthcare assistant Bonka Kostova faces a hearing next week after she was accused of dragging a 73-year-old patient around by the collar of his pyjamas.

Ms Kostova joined Stafford Hospital at the end of its scandal and allegedly abused Patient A on a night shift and told him 'you are no longer a human being but an animal'.

Nurse Reni Biju will also face the NMC hearing, accused of telling fellow nurses in 2008 a patient with heart problems was well. But the critically ill woman was not breathing and died shortly afterwards.

Despite this incident she was allowed to carry on working there for two more years, until she was accused of ill-treating a patient by ignoring her repeated requests to be taken to the toilet.

Nurses who worked in the hospital 
complained of bullying from the top down, with senior staff 'ruling with
fear' and treating patients 'like an inconvenience'.

At risk: Ministers believe thousands of patients could be at risk because examples of poor care reminiscent of that at Stafford Hospital (pictured) and Cannock Chase Hospital are 'dotted around' the NHS

Helene Donnelly told the Francis Inquiry that she tried to raise the alarm, said: 'It went right to the top that people didn’t want to know. And I think that’s why things got so extreme at Stafford.'

After being cleared at a hearing on January 23 this year, after a 
Nursing and Midwifery Council panel considered two complaints, Helen Moss 
now works for Ernst & Young as a consultant.

Her company won a contract to look at the financial viability of Mid 
Staffs NHS Foundation Trust, but Ernst and Young confirmed she would
not be working on it. They also told MailOnline she was not available for comment.

Ms Moss was director of nursing at the time, and took over from Jan Harry, 60, who has been suspended pending a NMC hearing in March.

Tragic: 86-year-old Bella Bailey died while she was a patient at Stafford General Hospital and her daughter Julie has been bent on improving standards ever since

Campaigner Julie Bailey is furious that not one member of staff has been disciplined or struck off following the scandal.

The families of those who suffered in Staffordshire have called for NHS 
chief Sir David Nicholson, who oversaw standards at Stafford during the scandal, and Royal College of Nursing (RCN) chief 
executive Peter Carter to resign.

'From all over the country I get emails asking for help, help for the complaints procedure, people that are actually suffering on the wards today, asking for help, from the particular hospitals that have been identified last night, but also other hospitals', Miss Bailey said.

'I can take these complaints down to particular wards within hospitals, they are so frequent, but there's just nobody to help these people, and this is the huge problem that's going on throughout the whole of the country.

'We know the NHS does some wonderful things but we also know it's doing some awful things to people, and they're our most vulnerable.'

In a growing crisis for the NHS it 
has also two other UK hospitals are now facing legal action from 18 
people whose loved-ones had their human rights breached with 
sub-standard care, it was also revealed today.

The BBC says claimants are targeting 
the Queen's Hospital in Romford in east London and Eastbourne District 
General and blame them for early deaths.

Yesterday it emerged that five more trusts - Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust - are to be investigated after they had higher-than-average death rates for two years running.

The damning report into the scandal at Stafford Hospital points 'very clearly' to the cultural changes the NHS has needed for a 'very long time', former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said today.

Mr Lansley, who left the job in last September's cabinet reshuffle, said his controversial reforms, which will see GP commissioning bodies manage services from this April, would not necessarily have prevented the scandal, but they will make NHS trusts more accountable to patients.

His comments came as it emerged MPs had demanded a Commons debate on the findings of Robert Francis QC's report into Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust between 2005 and 2009, which was published yesterday.

It highlighted an 'appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of patients', many of whom were left for hours sitting in their own faeces, while food and drink was left out of reach and hygiene was so poor that relatives had to clean toilets themselves.

Mr Lansley, now Leader of the House of Commons, told MPs his reforms to the structure of the way services were managed now meant it was possible to change the culture of the NHS.

He said: 'Many members in this House will understandably feel very strongly about what Robert Francis had to say in his report. I feel pretty strongly about it.

'I think it absolutely demonstrates that it was the right thing to do to appoint Robert Francis to undertake that public inquiry and I think it points very clearly to the kind of changes in culture and behaviour that the NHS needs now and has needed for a long time.

'This is not about the structures, because frankly I think in this House in the course of these last two and a half years we have given the NHS the structures that it needs.

'Robert Francis in the introduction to his report makes clear that it is now about achieving those culture changes within the structure of the new reforms and it can be achieved in that way.'

Tory MPs said they also wanted to see the NHS reformed.

Christopher Pincher (Tamworth): 'After what we learnt yesterday about the culture of box-ticking managerialism at the hospital, it seems to me that those people who close their eyes to reform of the NHS should open them and let's get on with it.'

Martin Vickers (Cleethorpes) said there was an 'evident lack of democratic accountability' in the NHS.
