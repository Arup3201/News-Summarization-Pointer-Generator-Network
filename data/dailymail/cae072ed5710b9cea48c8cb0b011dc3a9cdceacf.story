Startling surveillance footage has revealed the horrifying moment a school security guard punched a wheelchair-bound student before dumping him on to the ground.

Francisco Martinez, who has cerebral palsy, said the attack by Marchel Mitchell at Oakland High School on May 19 has left him in pain. Mitchell, 23, has now been arrested for the attack.

'He slapped me,' Martinez, 17, told KTVU after leaving hospital. 'He hit me so hard, it threw me out of my chair. I hit the floor with my chin first.'

Photos his mother took after the attack show scratches to his chin and head and bruises on his arms.

Abuse: Marchell Mitchell is seen on camera lifting his arm to beat 17-year-old Francisco Martinez, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. The security guard has now been arrested

Violent: He then allegedly dumped the boy, who was handcuffed, out of his chair onto the floor

No escape: The boy was unable to move due to the handcuffs and said the security guard cursed at him

Mitchell, a substitute school resource officer who had been employed by the school following a background check last November, was trying to get students to go to class before the May incident.

Martinez 'either refused to comply or was slow to do so,' Principal Matin Abdel-Qawi said in a letter to parents seen by the San Francisco Chronicle.

Mitchell pushed his chair and, after Martinez objected and tried to push the guard away, Mitchell handcuffed the teenager to the chair, he said.

Martinez admitted that he then spit on the guard because he saw he had no other option.

'I was handcuffed, so I didn't have no way to defend myself but my mouth,' Martinez told KTVU.

Treatment: He is pictured leaving hospital. He suffered a scraped chin and face and bruised arms

The footage then shows Mitchell repeatedly lifting his arm and punching the teenager as they move along the hallway before dumping him out of his chair.

He can be seen standing above the student, who is laid out on the floor, as other students stop to look before walking on.

Martinez said that he was also hit and thrown to the floor in the school's elevator before the incident, although this can not be seen on the camera footage.

Martinez, who has been undergoing therapy so he can strengthen his legs to be able to walk, added that when he told the guard he was in pain, he swore at him.

'He tells me like that, "I don't give a ***! I hope you don't walk for two to three weeks",' Martinez said.

Arrest: Mitchell, 23, was fired from the school and faces felony charges of corporal injury to a child

After the incident, Mitchell was fired and arrested by Oakland police. He has been charged with felony corporal injury to a child.

'I'm shocked and deeply hurt by this behavior and apologize on behalf of the staff at Oakland High,' Abdel-Qawi wrote. 'This incident is not reflective of the kind of culture we cherish at our school or how we treat one another.'

Francisco said he also wants the district to take action against a second security officer seen in the video, but it is not known what action they have taken, if any.

Mitchell will appear in court on June 16 for a pretrial hearing.
