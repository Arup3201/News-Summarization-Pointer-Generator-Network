Four-year-old Lyla has become the youngest person ever to sample the $295 nine-course tasting menu at world-renowned restaurant The French Laundry - and her verdict is in.

Lyla spent over five hours at chef Thomas Keller's triple Michelin star eatery, located in California's Nappy Valley; where she was served everything from caviar and butter-poached lobster to 'hen egg custard' and truffled gnocchi, as Bold Italic took notes on her opinions.

The summer melon soup was held in particular high regard for tasting like 'Tinker Bell Popsicles', but the edible flowers were puzzling for Lyla, and upon assessing the Jardinière de légumes, she piped up: 'At least it’s a salad, but it’s not very much salad.'

Where's the rest of it? Four-year-old Lyla reviewed the nine-course tasting menu at The French Laundry, a California restaurant with three Michelin stars, widely hailed as being 'the best restaurant in the world'

The French Laundry has been hailed by celebrity chef and food critic Anthony Bourdain as 'the best restaurant in the world, period' - and crucially for Lyla, has 'the most elegant bathroom I've ever SEEN.'

Established in 1978, it serves two different nine-course tasting menus daily; none of which uses the same ingredient twice. The fixed price is $295 before tipping, and wine pairing costs an extra $250; although in this case it was ginger ale served in a champagne glass, which Lyla was 'obsessed' with.

'Is this a flower? To eat? Eww. I'm keeping this. I'm gonna give it some water'

Lyla's first dish - an amuse-bouche consisting of 'avocado and lime crème fraîche wrapped in a sesame-seed tuile' - looked deceptively like an ice cream cone; which happens to be Lyla's favorite food (as long as it's a 'HARD cone').

'I like the white part better than the green part,' she surmised, after she had recovered from the crippling disappointment of the ice cream no-show.

Mixed feelings: The soup was held in high regard for tasting like 'Tinker Bell Popsicles', but Lyla was disappointed when an amuse-bouche which looked like an ice cream turned out to be an avocado wrap

After the summer melon soup - which was green, thus perhaps the Tinkerbell reference - Lyla was served two fishy dishes; the restaurant's notoriously decadent 'oysters and pearls' caviar plate, and the 'citrus-cured pacific yellowtail.'

Lyla obstinately refused to try either of them, because they looked to be 'really not good.'

'It looks like the house that bees live in. And I HATE bees!'

Next up was the 'hen egg custard,' which was served in an egg shell with its top sawn-off and filled with a 'ragoût of périgord truffles.' Lyla was deeply suspicious about the authenticity of the egg, theorizing that it is simply impossible to take off the top of a real shell without cracking it.

Once she'd forgiven the chef his blatant lie, she loved this course, and concluded that the chicken was like a 'fluffy marshmallow' and the feather tasted like a 'potato chip.' It should be noted that neither chicken nor feather were present in this meal.

What are you misleading me? Lyla was deeply suspicious about the authenticity of this egg, theorizing that it is simply impossible to take off the top of a real shell without cracking it

The following meaty charcuterie board was eschewed in favor of the accompanying bread, which she gobbled up with great relish before demanding seconds.

As for the pretentiously small salad, Lyla insisted that the peppers 'taste like babies', and that the edible flower was downright bonkers. 'Is this a flower? To eat? Eww. I'm keeping this.

'I'm gonna give it some water,' she said with some concern, before instead chopping it up into pieces on the tablecloth.

Excellent taste: Lyla was 'obsessed' with the ginger ale (pictured) and she also loved the shaved truffles, which she referred to fondly as 'black diamonds.' Her only suggestion to the chef was that they would be better if they were pink

Thrillingly, the next course consisted of more bread; this time served with 'molded butter.' Lyla was outraged. 'It looks like the house that bees live in. And I HATE bees!' she exclaimed.

There was another argument regarding the following dish, the 'sweet butter-poached maine lobster with black mission fig jam', which Lyla maintained was in fact shrimp.

The shaved truffles on the 'russet potato gnocchi' were a delight for the four-year-old critic with surprisingly sophisticated taste, likened fondly to 'black diamonds.' Her only suggestion to the chef was that they would be even better if they were pink.

Impressive notes of chocolate: The rich assortment of desserts went down a treat with Lyla, providing a sugary ending to a roller-coaster of culinary first's for the adorable tot

Spoiled for life: When Lyla's mother suggested they head out for a good old-fashioned pizza next time, she demanded they go back to The French Laundry instead

The 'herb roasted elysian fields farm lamb' was branded 'not delicious' and the subsequent 'cabot clothbound cheddar', though it claimed to be served with 'garden broccoli', was accused by Lyla of being yet another dishonesty.

'I don't see any broccoli. It's just a square with other stuff!' she proclaimed.

Her mother, however, may now have a bit of a problem on her hands. When she suggested to Lyla that they head out for a good old-fashioned pizza next time, she was met with an outcry.

Lyla demanded that they instead return to The French Laundry, her new favorite joint; along with the rest of the world it seems.
