Millions of pounds will never be recouped from a tax avoidance scheme used by celebrities after the taxman took so long to investigate it.

HM Revenue and Customs was so ‘unacceptably’ slow that it missed the legal deadline beyond which it cannot re-examine people’s tax affairs, a Parliamentary report said.

The Liberty scheme – used by stars including Take That’s Gary Barlow, singers George Michael and Katie Melua, actor Michael Caine, and the Arctic Monkeys – was closed in 2009 but was not taken to a tax tribunal until this year.

A report has revealed that the taxman will never get back up to £10million owed by rich tax avoiders because it failed to act before the 12-month deadline passed.

MPs accuse the HMRC of ‘putting tax revenues at risk’ and warned the slip-up ‘may just be the tip of the iceberg’.

The report is published as the taxman is requesting greater powers to take money directly from people’s bank accounts when it believes tax is owed.

But critics said last night that ‘error-prone’ HMRC should not be given more powers until it has proved it can ‘keep its eye on the ball’.

Actors, doctors and judges were among those who allegedly tried to shelter £1.2billion through Liberty, making it one of the biggest known tax-avoidance schemes. 

The Leeds firm was allegedly able to help clients avoid tax by offsetting their earnings against artificial losses it reportedly created offshore.

The Commons Public Accounts Committee was scathing about HMRC’s failures and said it ‘must do more faster’.

Its report into tax avoidance said: ‘Up to £10 million of the total £400 million tax at stake from the 2,000 users of this scheme may not be recoverable because in 30 cases HMRC failed to start inquiries into personal tax returns within the 12-month statutory deadline.’

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, said: ‘HMRC are missing deadlines as a result of a lack of drive, a lack of staff and a lack of a sense of urgency.

‘They believe £10 million is peanuts in the grand scheme of things, but that attitude is irresponsible. It is also about justice, and they should not be allowed to get away with it.

‘The majority of the public pay their fair share so why should some people, just because they are wealthy, treat it as a voluntary activity?’

Liberty is one of many legal tax-avoidance loopholes to have been exposed in recent years, used by celebrities, doctors and judges.

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The report is right to point the finger at HMRC but the real villains of the piece are the politicians who have created a tax code so complex that even the taxman can’t administer it.

‘Of course HMRC needs to up its game, but it’s hardly a surprise that mistakes creep in when you’re trying to enforce a tax system of almost comical complexity.’

Every year about £3 billion is lost through legal avoidance schemes. 

Barlow, 43, later apologised for using an avoidance scheme and said he would settle his tax affairs, while Miss Melua, 30, repaid what she owed.

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We have accelerated collection of tax from avoiders enormously.

‘The committee recognises we have addressed their key comments about tax avoidance. 

'The way we now work makes it clear to promoters and users of schemes that we will robustly tackle tax avoidance, so increasingly taxpayers are contacting us to help disentangle them from schemes that simply don’t work.’
