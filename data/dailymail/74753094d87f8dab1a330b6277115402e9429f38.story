Worrying: Big Brother contestant Dan Neal worked on the Jimmy Savile police case

Detectives are being paid overtime to watch Big Brother.

The ‘cushiest job ever’ is so Scotland Yard officers can monitor a former colleague taking part in the Channel 5 reality programme.

Dan Neal, 33, stunned Met bosses when he entered the Big Brother house last week. Until recently he was working on Operation Yewtree – the inquiry into Jimmy Savile and allegations of historic sex offences by other celebrities.

Senior officers raised fears that Mr Neal could compromise their highly sensitive investigation, prompting the programme’s producers to agree to a five-minute delay on the ‘live’ footage.

And detectives are mounting a costly round-the-clock operation to monitor the programme over the next two months, it has emerged.

Incredibly, the force is offering an inducement to watch Big Brother this weekend. Because they have been given less than 15 days’ notice to work on a rostered rest day, officers will receive time-and-a-half overtime pay.

Detectives are also entitled to a 10 per cent bonus for hours worked between 8pm and 6am – whether or not they are on a scheduled day off. A source said: ‘This has to be the cushiest police job ever. Questions have to be asked whether this is really necessary.’

It is not known how many officers will be in the office at any one time watching the programme, and recording it in case of the need for evidence.

But a source said that it was ‘good practice’ for two officers to be on duty together, in case one falls ill or asleep – even though there is no longer a 24-hour live TV stream of Big Brother.

Most days, only two hours are broadcast live from the house, with a further two hours of ‘highlights’ and analysis’.

There is also a daily Twitter feed from 8am to 2am which officers are believed to be monitoring.

Last week it was reported that police were ‘frantically ringing around’ Savile’s victims to reassure them their identities would not be revealed by Mr Neal, the 3-1 favourite to win the show, which runs until August 19.

The overtime bonanza has fuelled concerns about the running of Operation Yewtree – which critics claim has become a celebrity witch-hunt – when Scotland Yard is trying to make cuts of £500million.

Around 30 detectives are working full-time on the investigation, set up last autumn in the aftermath of the Savile scandal. It has already cost £1million, including salaries, various costs and more than £200,000 in overtime.

Detectives are said to be contacting anyone who was interviewed by Mr Neal. The former officer – believed to have been involved in two high-profile Yewtree arrests – tried to avoid discussing his police career on his first night in the Big Brother house, describing himself as ‘unemployed’.

He told host Emma Willis: ‘I’d done ten and a half years in the police and I’ve worked really hard and achieved a lot. I just need a change. I wanted to explore the creative side of my personality.’

Lawyer Liz Dux, head of the abuse department of Slater & Gordon, which represents 62 alleged victims of Savile, said: ‘This is extremely traumatic for some of the victims.

‘They have poured their hearts out to this detective – some of them disclosing details which they haven’t yet told their family.

‘Now they fear that him appearing on Big Brother will mean that some highly confidential information will be revealed. It’s not just the fear of what might come out on nation television, it’s also the fear of what this detective might be telling other housemates when the cameras are not on him which is giving them such torment.’

Channel 5 refused to be drawn on criticism levelled at the programme. It said: ‘Channel 5 takes its obligations as a broadcaster seriously and, as has been made clear to New Scotland Yard, extensive procedures are in place to ensure that nothing will be broadcast during the course of Big Brother which would involve the former police officer breaching confidentiality, invading the privacy of others, committing libel or a contempt of court.’

Last night a Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘The Metropolitan Police has raised our concerns with Channel 5 about the potential risks posed to live investigations by featuring a former detective constable who worked on those investigations.

‘The integrity of those investigations and our care for victims are of the utmost importance. Measures have been put in place to mitigate any risk. Unfortunately initially we had no choice but to spend overtime to ensure we monitored the comments being made on the Channel 5 programme over the weekend as we did not have prior notification of his inclusion on the programme. The need to pay overtime is now significantly reduced and the ongoing necessity to review the programme remains under regular review.’

Revealed: Dan Neal was involved in the Jimmy Savile case which found the deceased TV presenter to be one of 'the most prolific sex offenders'

The spokesman said the cost of monitoring the programme would be released ‘in due course’.

Last month the Mail revealed that comedian Jim Davidson was being investigated by Yewtree officers over claims that he indecently assaulted a woman in the Falkland Islands in the 1980s.

Detectives are probing claims he committed the alleged offence during a concert tour after the Falklands War. Davidson, 59, was originally arrested in January over alleged sex offences in the UK. He denies all the allegations.

Other arrested celebrities include, entertainer Rolf Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis and comedian Freddie Starr. Disgraced pop star Gary Glitter has also been detained. They also deny any wrongdoing.

PR guru Max Clifford has been charged with 11 counts of indecently assaulting teenage girls between 1966 and 1985. The 70-year-old has vowed to clear his name, labelling the allegations ‘a load of nonsense’.
