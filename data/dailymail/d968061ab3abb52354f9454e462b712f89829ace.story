The only cinema in Baghdad pulled 'American Sniper' last week after a phone call from a senior government official following sold-out showings and outbursts from audiences.

Those who went to screenings said reactions to the film were mixed, with some viewers cheering on Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle as others responded with anger.

The Washington Post reports that Fares Hilal, who operates the movie theater, says he stopped screenings after only a week because a Ministry of Culture official threatened to fine and close the cinema.

Out: The only cinema in Baghdad pulled 'American Sniper' after a phone call from a senior government official following a contentious week of sold-out showings and outbursts from attendees

'He told me the film insults Iraqis,' Hilal said. 'If we show it, we will be criticized. But if we don’t, we lose money. A lot of people wanted to see this film.'

The theater opened last year in the upscale Mansour Mall in central Baghdad, and has screened other new releases like 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' in 3D. 

In spite of the rejection from the ministry, most screenings of the film had sold out, with some Iraqis having to buy their tickets to the flick a week in advance, the Global Post reports.

Mall-goers say action movies are a hit at the theater, and during 'American Sniper,' attendees seemed to become absorbed in the film and even cheered Kyle on.

'Some people watching were just concentrating,' said Gaith Mohammed, about one scene in which Kyle radios for permission to shoot a possible threat. 'Others were screaming, ‘F---, shoot him! He has an IED, don’t wait for permission!'

There were brief outbursts of anger from crowds, one during the scene in which Kyle, played by Bradley Cooper, kills a child holding a rocket-power grenade launcher.

Three men in the front row of one screening jumped up 'shouting, "It’s all a lie," and "You are demeaning our culture,"' and had to be escorted out, said Mohammed Laith.

Sarmad Moazzem believed the movie was too simplistic - failing to differentiate between Shiite militias and Sunni extremists, such as al-Qaeda - and portrayed Iraqis only as terrorists.

Moazzem, who said he served alongside American soldiers with an Interior Ministry logistics division, stressed 'there are some people who loved the Americans and wanted them to stay to help rebuild our country.' 

Ahmed Kamal, like many Iraqis, only saw the film in pirated form after downloading it from the Internet, saying he didn't want to pay for a movie that called Iraqis 'savages.'

'I wasn’t prepared to spend money to see it,' Kamal said. 'It portrays Americans as strong and noble, and Iraqis as ignorant and violent.'

But Yasser Bakr, a teenager who operates a carousel at the mall, saw the movie and wasn't offended by the depiction of his country.

'It’s just a movie,' he said. 'About something that happened in the past.'

The film has also been polarizing in the United States - though almost exclusively stoking anger among political commentators.

'There’s a lot of anger in this country and the people who go see this movie are people who are very angry,' said former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean on Real Time with Bill Maher, adding he thinks there is overlap between the Tea Party and viewers of 'American Sniper.'  

In theaters, it has been a smash success, earning 247.75million in box office receipts after breaking the record for biggest January opening weekend ever.
