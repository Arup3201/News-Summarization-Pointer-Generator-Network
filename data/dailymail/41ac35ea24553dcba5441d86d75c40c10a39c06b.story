Halloween enthusiasts dressed in 'insensitive' costumes relating to MH370 and MH17 have sparked outrage across the globe and have even been slammed by the daughter of MH370 chief steward.

This year's annual festivity saw costumes 'mocking' families involved in the Malaysia Airlines tragedies, as social media users posted dozens of  'distasteful' pictures on Facebook, Instragram and Twitter with the hashtag #malaysia,   #toosoon and #MH370. 

Malaysian parties have condemned this twisted take on Halloween and have insisted that the individuals responsible should remove the 'tasteless' photos.

Halloween enthusiasts have used the annual festivity to 'mock' the tragedy of MH370 and MH17, as Malaysian citizens have expressed anger over the 'insensitive' Halloween costumes

Typically Halloween costumes attempt to take a humorous and clever twist on death, but dressing up as blood-strained crew zombies from Malaysia Airlines has proved bad taste among social media users 

'Such jokes or innuendos should be refrained strongly because it may hurt the feelings of those who have lost their loved ones,' Ismail Nasaruddin, President of The National Union of Flight Attendants Malaysia told Malay Mail.

'Having a Halloween party depicting the MH370 or MH17 does not give a positive message because those are international tragedies involving many nations.

'Do not add salt to the wound as the families have suffered enough.' 

Between MH370 and MH17 a total of 537 people from 19 different countries died. 

Costumes of MH370 zombie pilots and even a crafted cardboard MH370 plane was among the dress-ups  that caused fury around the world

Maira Elizabeth Nari, 18, daughter of MH370 chief steward Andrew Nari, compared the costumes to 'Malaysians making fun of the World Trade Centre tragedy'.

'Those people think it’s really funny but it is not,' she said.

'The ill-fated flight was not a joking matter and if they think this is a joke they are sick.' 

Social media users from across the globe have also criticised the revellers, suggesting their costumes have taken the tradition too far and calling them 'stupid', 'low', 'tasteless' and 'without a heart'.

Malaysian Flight 370 vanished on March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, with 239 passengers and crew aboard, including six Australians. 

The search is still continuing but has been on hold for four months so crews could map the seabed in the search zone. 

Flight MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 passengers, including 38 Australian citizens and residents. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Malaysia Airlines for comment.
