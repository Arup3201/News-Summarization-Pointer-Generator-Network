Would you feel better about gauging on junk food if it were dressed up like a gourmet feast?

That's the question followers of a clever new Instagram account are asking themselves, after taking a harder look at the deceiving dishes being served up online.

Appearing under a fictional name to remain anonymous, Chef Jacques LaMerde - which roughly translates to 'jack sh--' - the account pokes fun at high-end dining by dressing up cheap, fattening, convenience store goods to look like fancy gastronomic creations.

Not only are the plates artistically manufactured, but they come with equally pretentious captions.

One description, featuring a Hot Pocket as the centerpiece, read: 'Hay-baked Hot Pockets with Hidden Valley Bacon Ranch spheres and a puree of Zoodles'

Fancy that: The Instagram account Jacques LaMerde is dressing up junk food as fine dining to poke fun at high-end restaurants. Seen here is a corn dog with packet ham, Spongebob Squarepants macaroni and ketchup

I'll have s'more, please: This delicate assortment features generic chocolate cake 'from the freezer section', banana popsicle, 'Muscle Milk spheres' and Graham cracker pastry cream. Delicious

Gourmet all the way: Here we have a cupcake with Rainbow Dunk-A-Roos, yogurt raisins, dusted with Starbucks Mocha Frappacino 'caviar'

Flavorsome: Here we have a slice of Jimmy Dean sausage with canned spring vegetas, Frito hoops and a 'palate cleansing shot of fermented Lake Michigan water with nutisional (sic) yeast rim

Looks a little different here: The dishes use cheap, everyday junk food, such as Fritos and Jimmy Dean sausage patties

Dessert time: Looks elaborate right? It's actually just a Pop Tart with Mike n Ike and some Mentos scattered about

Gastronomic: This creation was called 'Bugs on a stick' and features raisins on a celery stick with Cheez Whiz and kale shreds
