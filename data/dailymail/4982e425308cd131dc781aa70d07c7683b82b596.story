Sevilla celebrated their Europa League triumph in front of thousands of jubilant fans in the Spanish city on Thursday.

Just hours after the nail-biting penalty shoot-out win against Benfica in Turin, supporters lined the streets to greet Unai Emery and his players.

They boarded an open-top bus to take them through the city to the pier, where they boarded a boat to carry on the procession.

Sevilla keeper Beto was the hero, denying Oscar Cardozo and Rodrigo from 12 yards before Kevin Gameiro fired home the winning penalty.

Emery praised his players for staying strong as they edged out Benfica in heartbreaking fashion.

He said: 'You could tell our players were suffering from fatigue and physical discomfort but this team has learned how to suffer. We have learned how to stay strong and so we were ready for that.'
