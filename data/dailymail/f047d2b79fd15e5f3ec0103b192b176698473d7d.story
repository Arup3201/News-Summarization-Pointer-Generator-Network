It's that time of year again, and football clubs are doing their bit to wish their loyal fans a Merry Christmas. However some get it right, others not so much. 

Chelsea became the latter when they roped in three of their biggest stars to wail their own rendition of a classic Christmas carol.

Eden Hazard, Branislav Ivanovic and Oscar were the choirboys on this occasion, albeit horrifically off key. 

Branislav Ivanovic and Eden Hazard have something to laugh about as they wish fans a merry Christmas

Starting with Brazilian bawler Oscar, the trio belt out a version of 'We wish you a Merry Christmas’.

Taking the baton, Ivanovic and Hazard take over to round it all off and wish their fans 'a Happy New Year’, before bursting into a fit of laughter... probably at the sound of their lazy larynges.

One thing can be said as the Blues concentrate on staying top of the Premier League table over the festive period going into Monday's game at Stoke - stick to the day job, guys.
