Lydon said that he is not an enemy of Baroness Thatcher now that she is dead

Former Sex Pistol John Lydon says those now celebrating Margaret Thatcher's death are 'loathsome'.

Lydon, famously known as Johnny Rotten when he was the singer in Punk icons The Sex Pistols back in the 1970s as Maggie was rising to power, added: 'I'm not going to dance on her grave.'

He said: 'I was her enemy in her life but I will not be her enemy in her death.'

He also denied being a mysogynist and a Nazi following a controversial appearance this week on Aussie TV show, The Project.

During the interview he told presenter Carrie Bickmore: 'Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Now listen, when a man is talking do not interrupt.'

He also gave a wave during the interview, which has been misinterpreted by some in the Aussie media as a Nazi salute.

John spoke about Baroness Thatcher's death when he arrived at Sydney's domestic airport on Wednesday from Brisbane ahead of his band Public Image Limited's performance in the city that night.

The 57-year-old said: 'I'm not happy about the boo boo parties.

'When
 someone dies, give them respect. Enemy or not. I can't be listening to 
folk who do that.

'What kind of politics are they offering me? You dance 
on another person's grave? That's loathsome.'

The singer said he would not be dancing on Margaret Thatcher's grave

But as to whether he would be watching an TV coverage of Baroness Thatcher's funeral, he said: 'I might have something better to do.'

He added: 'Her politics were really dreadful and derisive and caused a great many issues for me when I was young, for all of us trying to go through that.

'But that don't mean I am gonna dance on her grave, as they say. I'm not that kind of person.

'I was her enemy in her life but I will not be her enemy in her death. I am not a coward.'

He added: 'My entire life, socially, was all around the Maggie era.

'That was the great challenge as a Sex Pistol was how to deal with Margaret Thatcher.

'I think we did rather good.'

He also denied she was having a Diana-style funeral.

'She's not. It's a Conservative send off. Do you think they'll be parading me through the streets of London?

'I'm more likely to be dragged along from the back of a wagon.'
