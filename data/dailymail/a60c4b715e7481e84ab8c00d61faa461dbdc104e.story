Taliban militants in Afghanistan have warned ISIS insurgents fighting in Iraq to 'avoid extremism' in a plea for unity among jihadists.

It urged the Sunni faction, which has been waging a bloody insurgency against Shi'ite Muslim groups in Iraq, to avoid 'distrusting' other Islamist groups.

Commanders of the al-Qaeda-linked group also pleaded with the fighters of ISIS, which recently declared an Islamic 'Caliphate' in its captured territory, to respect the rule of law.

Fractious: The militant group was urged to join a council with other jihadist factions and not to 'distrust' them

ISIS began life as an offshoot of al-Qaeda, but was disowned by the global terror network after bolstering its strength by merging with other groups in Syria. 

The call for unity was uploaded to the Afghan Taliban's website this week. It did not name ISIS directly, but clearly referred to the group, who are now thought to be the world's most powerful jihadists.

The message, originally in Arabic, said: 'It is worthy for a shurah (consultation) council to be formed from the leaders of all the jihadi factions and the distinguished people among the experts and the scholars in Sham (Syria) in order to solve their conflicts.'

'Muslims also should avoid extremism in religion, and judging others without evidence, and distrusting one another,' it said.

'They should avoid conflict and dispute, and not think their opinions are better than others. Mercy and compassion should prevail.'

On June 29, ISIS announced that it had renamed itself the Islamic State and proclaimed its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi their 'Caliph', or head of state.

The group had fallen out with al-Qaeda over its expansion into Syria, where it has carried out beheadings, crucifixions, and mass executions.

In recent weeks, ISIS has overrun the Iraqi city of Mosul and advanced towards the capital Baghdad. In Syria they have captured territory in the north and east, along the border with Iraq.

Taliban spokesmen in both Pakistan and Afghanistan declined to comment on al-Baghdadi's claim to be the global leader of all Muslims. The Afghan and Pakistani Taliban are separate but allied.

Privately, some commanders said that they did not want to anger al-Qaeda, whom they considered a long-time ally in the fight against NATO troops in the region.

Some Taliban, including some of the younger commanders, were enthusiastic about ISIS.

Pakistan's own insurgency is on the back foot after the military launched an offensive against the Taliban's key stronghold last month.

Most senior commanders are in hiding. Drone strikes have depleted many of the Taliban's and al-Qaeda's most experienced and charismatic commanders.

One Pakistani militant commander in his thirties told reporters: 'We are happy with the great efforts of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Dozens of my colleagues from here are with them. Soon Sham and Iraq will be Islamic states'.

'I like the way of fighting ... it is very effective. We need that here in Pakistan. Many of our fighters have gone there.'

Another, younger man added: 'We like the modern way of there fighting, it is really a holy war, God send us there.'
