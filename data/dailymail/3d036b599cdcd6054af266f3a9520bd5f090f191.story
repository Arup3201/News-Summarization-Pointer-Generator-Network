Controversial: Ron Hogg, from Durham Constabulary, claims claims 'consumption rooms' for heroin users would help curb crime

Drug addicts should be given ‘safe heroin’ and a private place to inject it – all at taxpayers’ expense, according to an elected police commissioner.

Ron Hogg, the Police and Crime Commissioner in charge of Durham Constabulary, said the state should provide heroin for free and ‘consumption rooms’ where addicts can inject without fear of arrest or prosecution. It would cost the state an estimated £18,000 a year per user.

The Labour politician, who is a former senior police officer, said: ‘We want the health service to provide addicts with safe heroin, with consistent purities and safe additives. We believe this will help reduce disease and death. This doesn’t mean we’re going soft on drugs in any way.

‘What we are saying is we have a group of people here who commit large numbers of crimes to feed their habits and those illegal drugs cause massive health problems.’

However, critics rejected his proposal. Kathy Gyngell, a research fellow at the Centre for Policy Studies, said it was ‘totally irresponsible’, adding: ‘Shouldn’t we be spending that money on intensive rehab and trying to get them off drugs?’

Mr Hogg’s suggestion was also shot down by the Home Office. A spokesman said the Government had ‘no plans to allow drug consumption rooms’.

Earlier this year Mr Hogg’s chief constable, Mike Barton, called for the legalisation of class A drugs like heroin and cocaine as the war against them had ‘failed’.

Mr Hogg said he was not suggesting drugs should be freely available, but said better regulation could help bring a halt to addiction.

Mr Hogg, a former senior policeman, said: 'The successes of trials around the world have led both myself and chief constable Mike Barton to believe that using drug consumption rooms to treat heroin addiction should be explored further - certainly county-wide.

‘Results published in the Lancet showed that prescribing pharmaceutical heroin in this way can reduce the use of street drugs and associated levels of crime.’

Pilot schemes which involved decriminalising drugs have already been held in London, Brighton and Darlington.

Councillors in East Sussex are set to consider consumption rooms - often dubbed ‘shooting galleries’ - in Brighton next year.

But Public Health England, part of the Department of Health, said consumption rooms might not be the best way to tackle illegal drug use.

It said: ‘These facilities would be expensive to provide and may not be the most cost effective way of achieving outcomes for service users.’

Danish solution: One of Copenhagen's consumption rooms, available to the city's 8,000 hard drug users

Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, slammed the scheme as a misuse of public funds.

He said: 'Many people will have very serious reservations about their money being spent in this manner.

'Police chiefs should be doing their part to tackle addiction, not spending taxpayers’ money facilitating it.

'Ultimately
taxpayers would be paying for a room for people to break the law in, 
something that could have very serious and unforeseen consequences.'

Copenhagen, in Denmark, already runs a similar scheme to the one proposed by Mr Hogg.

There are 8,000 hard drug users there, who all have access to two drug consumption rooms, launched last year and this August.

Ivan Christensen, who manages the rooms, told the BBC: 'We are providing a clean environment for long-term addicts and we have found that they are now much more likely to access other health services in the area.'
