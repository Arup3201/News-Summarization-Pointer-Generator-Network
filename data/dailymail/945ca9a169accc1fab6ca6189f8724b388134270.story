Former Arsenal striker Alan Smith has criticised the club's recruitment policy, insisting that manager Arsene Wenger is not decisive enough in the transfer market.

The Gunners started the Premier League game against Newcastle on Saturday evening with Mathieu Debuchy playing out of position in the centre of defence and 19-year-old Hector Bellerin playing at right back.

With Laurent Koscielny injured and Callum Chambers missing through suspension, Arsene Wenger's defensive options are limited and Smith can not understand why the Arsenal boss did not sign a defender in the summer.

The former Arsenal striker said Arsenal should have signed another central defender in the summer

'They knew Koscielny had a problem with his achilles, that has flared up several times already,' Smith said on Sky Sports ahead of the match. 

'They knew Vermaelen was leaving. So why haven't they brought someone in? I think the recruitment is something they need to look at because they are not decisive enough. Arsene tends to change his mind a lot.'

Meanwhile Jamie Redknapp criticised Wenger's reluctance to buy a defensive midfielder, something Arsenal fans have been crying out for.

'He just keeps proving the critics right unfortunately. That's what he's doing week in week out. 

'A defensive midfield player, every Arsenal fan that is in here probably says the same thing, "we're crying out for somebody that can do that role", because it's not always the defenders that are at fault, it's that protection that they need.
