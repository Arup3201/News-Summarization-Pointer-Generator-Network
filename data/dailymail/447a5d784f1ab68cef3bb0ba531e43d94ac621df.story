Right fit: The 'Scandfit' bra is designed for women with implants

A woman who had trouble finding the right bra after a  boob job has created her own range of lingerie specifically for those who have had surgery.

Rachel Atkinson, 30, designed her ScandFit bras after finding that underwiring can chafe on scars and dig into implants.

She was so uncomfortable after going from an A cup to a DD that she had to wear an unflattering sports bra all the time.

Now Rachel has quit her job as an adviser with a mortgage broker to devote herself to her new business selling £85 bras made of silk elastane, polymide, and polyester which look attractive but provide the right support.

Rachel, of London, said: ‘After I had surgery I couldn’t find anything that fitted. I looked at why that was and it’s due to the shape.

'The underwiring digs into the implant, especially when you bend forward or to the side.’

Plastic surgeon Nigel Mercer confirmed that many other women suffer the same problem.

Mr Mercer, former president  of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘Women tell me “I can’t  find anything that fits.”

‘Her bra gives support where it’s needed and it looks brilliant. Women who wear them look a million dollars.’

Rachel will unveil the range at Kensington Olympia this week.
