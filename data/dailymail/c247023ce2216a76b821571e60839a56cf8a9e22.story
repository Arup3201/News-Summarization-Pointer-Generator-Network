A teenager hacked to death in a machete attack was trying to protect a group of young girls from a 'lunatic' when he was killed, according to his family.

Zacary Evans, 19, was one of three friends attacked with a machete as he tried to act as a peacemaker outside the Pike and Musket pub in Tuffley, Gloucester, in the early hours of Saturday.

Detectives are questioning a 44-year-old Gloucester man on suspicion of murder and officers are still searching for the weapon – thought to be a machete at least two feet in length.

A spokesman for Mr Evans's family told the Sunday Telegraph: 'It's something that should never have happened, he stepped in to help someone else.

The teenager was  one of three friends attacked  outside the Pike and Musket pub in Tuffley, Gloucester (pictured today)

'We understand there was an altercation between some girls with Zac, and their friends and Zac stepped in to help.

'Then some lunatic came out of nowhere and attacked him. You don't expect this to happen in a local pub, it is a lovely, friendly place.'

Mr Evans died at the scene and his friend Chris Lord, 18, was left with minor injuries.

A 22-year-old man with them was rushed to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital with serious injuries and is now said to be in a stable condition.

His mother Sylvia left a stirring message at the scene of his death which read: 'The stars will shine much brighter with you in heaven'

Prayers will be said for the family and friends of the murdered teenager today at St George's Church

Today, Mr Evans' mother left a moving tribute to her son - who she refers to as 'Sparky' - on her Facebook page,

She said: 'Well yesterday was like a horrific dream. Sadly the news was true. Sparky will not be coming home.

'On behalf of the family, please accept out heartfelt thanks for all your kind words and love towards Zac on his tragic and futile death.

'It's meant so much to receive all your thoughts. Please keep praying for us... We have a very long road to travel yet.

'A wonderful son, brother, Grandson, boyfriend and friend. You will be greatly missed. A hole in my heart cannot be filled.' 

She also left a message at the scene of his death which said: 'The stars will shine much brighter with you in heaven.

A white Transit van near the scene, which had three large blood smears on the side of it, was being examined by forensic teams yesterday. 

Prayers were said for the family and friends of the murdered teenager earlier today at St George's Church in Tuffley.

Mr Evans's childhood friend Harry Lauder, 19, laid flowers on the pavement outside the pub with a message saying 'Sleep well young man, you and your memories will never be forgotten. Hope to see you again one day.'

Mr Lauder, who works in a warehouse, said he was in shock.

'Zac just wasn't the type of lad to get into situations like this,' he said. 'He didn't often go out at night even.

Flowers and dozens of tributes have been left and police are calling on anyone who witnessed the attack to come forward with information

'His girlfriend will be in pieces too. They had been going out for quite a long time.' 

Sophie Jadie wrote on Twitter: 'RIP Zac Evans, such a kind, caring and good friend, you will never be forgotten, I'll see you there one day, shine bright angel.'

Detective Chief Inspector Steve Porter said: 'We are keen to trace what we believe to be the weapon in this attack, which is a large machete-type weapon with a large blade at least 24 inches long.

'If anybody knows the location of that weapon, or where it could be discarded we would ask them to come forward.

'We believe we have identified the victim and have spoken to the family, who are obviously distraught at this incident and their loss.'

The officer added: 'We'd appeal to anybody with any information in relation to what occurred this morning, or anybody with knowledge of why this incident occurred, and particularly anybody who knows the whereabouts of the weapon, to please contact us as soon as possible.' 

Anyone with information is urged to call Gloucestershire Police on 101.

The family of Mr Evans have said he may have been trying to defend a group of girls during the attack
