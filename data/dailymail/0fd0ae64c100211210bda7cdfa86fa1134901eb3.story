An overlooked bill for $140 nearly lead to a New Jersey plumber and his wife losing their home in a tax lien fight.

Dominick Vulpis told MSNBC how he became one of a growing number of people whose property tax liens are sold to real estate investors who then demand missed payments plus interest from the homeowners.

In the case of Mr Vulpis and his wife Lindarose, the $140 charge and four years of interest payments coupled with lawyers fees added up to $50,000.

Contentious property: Dominick and Lindarose Vulpis live in this home in Lincroft, New Jersey and because they missed one $140 payment, they were at risk of losing it all together

'It was never brought to my attention until it was too late and we were served with papers saying we had to move out of our house,' Mr Volpis told the news site.

On the surface, the issue of the overdue bills does not seem surprising or new. However it is the numerous transitions of said overdue bill that come as a surprise.

At risk: Now Lindarose Vulpis (pictured) and her husband have to pay nearly $50,000 in interest rates and backpayments as well as legal costs

In the case of Mr Vulpis, that is a surprise that nearly cost him his home.

With a number of towns filing for chapter 9 bankruptcy- including three municipalities in California- city governments across the country are looking for ways to bring in some much-needed cash.

One quick fix, that has potentially unintended consequences, is if the city government sells the rights to the unpaid tax liens on homes in their jurisdiction to investors who hope to recoup the amount due from the unpaid bill as well as the interest that they can collect during the elapsed time.

'Now you're seeing more and more single-family homes pop up on the tax lien list. They're owner-occupied homes with people who are having trouble keeping up with their tax payments,' Anthony Mercantante, the Middletown, New Jersey administrator who sold the Vulpis tax lien, told MSNBC.

While the profits on individual homes may not be enough for the towns to stave off bankruptcy completely, these moves have helped amass a surprisingly large financial band-aide.

The National Consumer Law Center released a report saying that in 2010, local governments collected a total of $15billion by selling off home tax liens.

Said liens are scooped up by a wide range of investors- like, in the case of the Vulpis home, a group called Approved Realty Group- who turn around and charge the homeowners for their missed bill payments plus interest with rates that can go as high as up to 18 per cent.

Depressing trend: More local governments are selling off their liens on owned-homes to investors who then demand the missed payments plus exorbitant interest rates from the owners or else they sell the property

That meant that Mr Vulpis was hit with a bill for $37,500 from Approved Realty Group.

They worked out a way for the bill to be paid in conjunction with their mortgage, but because of the pre-existing mortgage payments and the legal fees that came with the lien battle, the entire episode will end up costing the Vulpis’ approximately $50,000.

For families in similar situations, such agreements cannot be reached and result in foreclosed homes.

‘I think he stuck me up without a gun, this guy. If he was a nice guy he could have said “Ok, I understand what happened, give me $5,000 for my troubles,” but he wanted a lot of money,’ Mr Vulpis told MSNBC.
