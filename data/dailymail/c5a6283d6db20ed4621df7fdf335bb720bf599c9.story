Semesa Rokoduguni took part in his first England training session on Monday as Stuart Lancaster's side gathered at Pennyhill Park ahead of the autumn internationals.

The Bath winger, called up following his impressive performances in the Aviva Premiership, is hoping to make his debut against New Zealand at Twickenham on November 8.

He was named in last week's initial 32-man squad, which was extended to 41 on Sunday night following the arrival of Dave Ewers, Henry Slade, Thomas Waldrom, Henry Thomas, Alex Waller, Ben Foden, Matt Kvesic, Anthony Watson and Richard Wigglesworth.

Injury ruled out Luther Burrell, Billy Vunipola, Dave Wilson and Joe Marler from the session, but Wasps skipper James Haskell returned to training after suffering from a virus.

Tom Wood has remained in Northampton with his wife ahead of the birth of their third child and is expected to join the squad later this week.

'We always anticipated bringing in additional players following the European games, either to cover injuries or for training,' said Lancaster.

As well as the All Blacks, England will also face South Africa, Samoa and Australia in the four-Test series.
