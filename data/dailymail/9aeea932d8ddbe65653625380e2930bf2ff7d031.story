An out-of-control truck has overturned at a busy intersection in Sydney's north after smashing into as many as seven cars and trapping people underneath.

It is understood the truck was on Waringah Road at Dee Why just after 6am on Tuesday when the vehicle's brakes failed, Nine News reports.

The truck reportedly crossed over the median strip and ploughed into several cars that had stopped at a set of traffic lights at the Waringah Road and Pittwater Road intersection.

A taxi driver who witnessed the crash told 2GB the truck had landed on top of three cars waiting at the traffic lights after hitting the median strip and crossing over into incoming traffic. 

"They were standing still at the lights, they had nowhere to move, and (the truck) has just gone straight over the top of them all," the witness told the radio station.

The truck was carrying various items including flour, which exploded onto the road.  

NSW Police said emergency crews were working to free those trapped in the wreckage and fuel was leaking from one of the vehicles.

All southbound lanes are closed and motorists are being advised to avoid the area.
