A father called the local Sheriff’s deputy to his home to witness him spanking his daughter with a paddle to make sure he wasn’t committing a crime.

The unnamed dad called the Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office in Florida, to come and watch him paddle his 12-year-old daughter, and they dutifully arrived.

He wanted to discipline his child after she got into a heated argument with her sister on Monday, according to a deputy's report obtained by WLWT 5.

Paddle: The unnamed dad called the Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office in Florida, to come and watch him paddle his 12 year old daughter

Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office said it is not the first time that they have been asked to supervise a beating

Undersheriff Noel Stephen, seen here, said he had personally supervised approximately 12 spankings

Noel Sheriff, the underSheriff for Okeechobee county said: 'There is a big difference between beating your child and disciplining your child. 

'Parents are seeking guidance on how to deal with their child. You are entitled to paddle your child, whether you use your hand, you use your belt or a paddle within reason as long as your paddling the buttocks.'

In this case, the 'whooping' was not considered to be a crime, so the deputy wrote up his police report and left the house.

An unnamed local resident told the channel: 'People don't want to hit their kids because of consequences from the authorities.'

However, it's not the first time that a parent has called Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office to supervise a beating.

The sheriff's office said it had received several similar requests in the past and Undersheriff Noel Stephen said he had personally supervised 12 spankings.

But the sheriff's office stated that while it is not 'advertising this type of service' they will  come to your house if they're not busy on other calls.

Stephen added: 'It's definitely not something we advertise to do, and even though law enforcement has been willing to help out in this situation, watching a parent discipline their child is something that's done only when a deputy has no other calls to handle.'

The sheriff's office said it is not 'advertising this type of service' but if it has nothing else to do they will come to your house and supervise

The father's actions have received plenty of support from local residents.

'Good for him!' one said. 'Look at these kids nowadays, most of them are in prison.

'A bit of a whooping never hurt nobody. It didn't hurt me when I was growing up, didn't hurt my mother, or father we're all still alive.'
