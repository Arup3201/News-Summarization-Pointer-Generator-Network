Laddish comic Dapper Laughs has retired the 'persona' which prompted outrage in an ITV2 show - and claims the complaints against him have 'wrecked his life'.

Daniel O'Reilly was grilled on the BBC's Newsnight after 68,000 people and 44 comedians called for his show On The Pull to be axed for giving a platform to 'everyday sexism'.

He found internet fame on Vine and Twitter - leading to his TV show - as south London 'lad' Dapper Laughs, who engaged women in 'banter' in the name of comedy.

But his UK tour and possible second series were cancelled after he told a stand-up audience member she was 'gagging for a rape'.

Laddish: Daniel O'Reilly was grilled on the BBC's Newsnight after 68,000 people and 44 comedians called for his ITV2 show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull to be axed for giving a platform to 'everyday sexism'

The comedian said: 'Obviously I don't think that, but I'm taking the mick out of what I thought men think'

Dressed all in black with a turtle-neck jumper, he told Newsnight anchor Emily Maitlis last night: 'It's completely ruined everything that's going on with me as a comedian.

'The bad press and everything that's happened - it's wrecked my life to a certain extent.'

Mr O'Reilly, from Clapham, south London, insisted repeatedly that Dapper Laughs was a 'character' and didn't reflect his real personality.

On his show inciting rape

If it was a guide to rape, I would have done one five-minute episode, come on and go "Oi oi, I'm Dapper Laughs, go down the shops, get some rope, bit of duct tape, rape the b****, well done, see you later"

On homeless people

A tramp just asked me what I was looking at,"Your tooth" I said,he laughed, which revealed two more random teeth, which ruined the joke

On his own demise

Breaking news, Dapper Laughs dies of a viagra overdose. Apparently his girlfriend took it very hard

On women's tastes

Girls love brains almost as much as they love b*******. There's loads of them in bookstores. Girls, try this [book], it's a bit long, it's about my ****

On how to market himself

Watch my TV show on ITV2 and I'll shag ya. Yeah that works. That's work, c'mon!

He said: 'At the time I didn't think that so many people would end up seeing it. In the end it became very popular and I kind of got a bit carried away with it, to be honest with you.

'It's wrong but, to me, I didn't see it as me who was saying it, I was creating this character and I was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was popular.

'I thought that the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it.'

The ITV2 show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull - which claimed to teach awkward men how to talk to women - finished its first series on November 3.

It was widely criticised after the comedian bellowed his catchphrases 'she knows' and 'proper moist' at women in the street.

He said he took the decision to cancel the tour after deciding he did not want to perform as the character any more.

'I am not going to allow Dapper Laughs to represent me,' he said. 'I want the people out there to know that not only am I going to stop it, I am going to help it not being promoted.'

His bids to defend himself previously led to even more anger.

Defending claims the show encouraged rape, he told a live audience: 'If it was a guide to rape, I would have done one five-minute episode, come on and go "Oi oi, I'm Dapper Laughs, go down the shops, get some rope, bit of duct tape, rape the b****, well done, see you later".'

He was later heard telling a female audience member she was 'gagging for a rape'. 

Offensive: Newsnight host Emily Maitlis told the comedian his act 'incites harassment and violence'

Provocative: The south London 'lad' rose to internet infamy with his six-second Vines about pulling women

The comedian produced a charity Christmas album to raise money for Shelter - but the homelessness charity rejected the offer because of his offensive jokes about homeless people.

In one tweet in October last year he said: 'Just gave my number to a homeless woman (cracking boobs tho, not sure if her top was low cut or just ripped) closed with: your place or mine'.

In another in June he said: 'A tramp just asked me what I was looking at,"Your tooth" I said,he laughed, which revealed two more random teeth, which ruined the joke.'

Face-off: Daniel O'Reilly was grilled by the BBC's Emily Maitlis as he revealed he is retiring his 'character'

EMILY MAITLIS: Dan O'Reilly, at best what you do is offensive, at worst it incites harassment and violence.

DANIEL O'REILLY: Mm. No, d'you know what, from the beginning when I started the character Dapper Laughs it caught on really quick that that type of humour was really popular for a certain demographic of people... In the end it became really popular and I kind of got a little bit carried away with it to be honest with you.

EM: When you see that now, what do you think?

DOR: If that was the first time I'd seen that kind of comedy I'd think the character is not setting a good example, but at the time when we were doing it, it was getting so much praise from the audience it was being received by and growing and growing and growing... I thought maybe y'know these people could see that I'm, cos, saying that, obviously to me, it's like c'mon, that's not, that's not real, obviously I don't think that, but I, I'm taking the mick out of what I thought men think, d'you what I mean?

EM: Right. So when you say you're giving advice to men on the pull and for example you say 'get your g*** out' to women, can you deny that would encourage men to do that on the street?

DOR: Yeah potentially of course, you're right, it's, it's, y'know, it's wrong, but, to, well I'm not going to say but, but to me, I didn't see it as me that was saying that, I was creating this character and I was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was quite popular.

EM: So you agree that when you create this character and it incites sexual violence...

DOR: I didn't think it did at the time, I thought the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it.

EM: You've said Dapper Laughs is an extension of yourself. He allows you to do things you wouldn't normally do and you blame it on him. Doesn't sound like satire at all, it sounds like an excuse.

DOR: Well that's not the attitude that I did have with it. D'you know what, to be completely honest with you, it was great at the beginning for me, it's completely ruined everything that's going on with me as a comedian.

EM: Just another line that came up, 'Just show her your penis, if she cries she's playing hard to get'. There's a bit in the film we saw where you're holding up a knife and you say 'Lift up your f****** shirt. Was that all just done in jest?

DOR: No disrespect to you, looking at me now, do you think I'd go out and do that? I was creating, I was pushing the boundaries of that character.

EM: But what you're saying is that women who say no don't mean no, and if people watching that think it's funny and they go and enact that, then that's the consequence...

DOR: That makes me sad to think if someone had done that and I was responsible for that it's terrible. That's why this week with the bad press and everything that's happened, I've stopped and said, y'know, it's wrecked my life to a certain extent.

EM: So you're feeling like a bit of a victim now, are you?

DOR: I wouldn't say that, maybe a victim of my own mistakes.
