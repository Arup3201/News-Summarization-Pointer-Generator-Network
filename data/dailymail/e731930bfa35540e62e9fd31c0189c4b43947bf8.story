Erin Burnett is not a morning person.

After the CNN host reportedly refused to give up her prime-time slot, the network’s executive, Jeff Zucker, is mulling over more morning-friendly options to host opposite Chris Cuomo.

According to Page Six, that includes NBC’s ‘Today’ show correspondent and MSNBC host Tamron Hall, as well as other CNN hosts like Brooke Baldwin.

The 24-hour news channel has been going through an influx of change after bringing on Zucker, who most recently served as the president and CEO of NBC Universal.

The New York Post gossip page, citing a source at the network, reports that CNN anchor Suzanne Malveaux is also in the running.

An insider for RadarOnline told the gossip website that Burnett was officially offered the morning position, ‘but as a negotiating tactic played too hard to get.

’Her game playing, the source said, caused executives ‘to wonder if she’s worth the cost of doing business.’

The source further added that Burnett had planned out the CNN staff with whom she would – or wouldn’t – work.

Among the ‘won’t’ list: executive vice president of CNN Ken Jautz, as well as Bart Feder, the vice president of the station, according to the source.

CNN representatives did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Sources told Page Six last Friday that Burnett's $2.5 million contract with CNN includes a clause requiring her show to air in prime time and the cable network would need to offer her an attractive buyout to get her to budge.

The new CNN chief, who was appointed 
president last November and resumed his duties on January 1, decided to 
revamp the cable network's morning lineup and get rid of 'Starting Point,'
hosted by Soledad O’Brien.

Former ABC News journalist Chris Cuomo will move to the new morning show but is in need of a partner.

Burnett, who is recently married and has no children, is Zucker's top choice for the 
co-host opening but she has reportedly told her staff that she doesn't want 
to make the move to mornings.

Burnett, a former financial 
analyst, got her big break on CNBC hosting the morning business show Squawk on the Street.

She left the Peacock Network for CNN in 2011.

With a primetime post detailed in her contract, she is said to be angling to get a buyout with a higher salary offering.

The 7pm show Erin Burnett 'OutFront' 
started in October 2011 but has not made a mark in the ratings, 
especially competing against other primetime heavyweights Fox News and 
MSNBC.

However, Burnett's show regularly gets twice as many viewers as she 
did on CNBC.

Change: Zucker has moved Chris Cuomo, left, to the morning slot that will push Soledad O'Brien, right, out of the CNN morning show, 'Starting Point,' that currently runs from 7am to 9am
