A married doctor who was secretly recorded enjoying sex sessions with a woman patient was struck off yesterday.

GP Simon Robinson, 44, was told he had 'exploited' Jill Tudor for his own 'sexual gratification' by conducting a 16-month affair with her.

His career was left in tatters after he was found to have shown a 'reckless disregard' for the principles of good medical practice by a disciplinary panel.

Last night his 50-year-old victim said the outcome had made the ordeal of having tapes of their encounters played in public worthwhile.

'This is the right outcome,' she told the Daily Mail. 'People like him are in a position of power and think they can get away with exploiting others, but my case proves they can be found out.

'Other women need to know that GPs aren't always the wonderful, trusting people that we think they are.'

Relationship: The GP had a 16-month fling with Jill Tudor

Dr Robinson, a father-of-two, regularly engaged in sex sessions with five-times married Miss Tudor during 'triple and quadruple appointments' at his surgery in Oswestry, Shropshire and at her home.

He would call her his 'Number One patient' in greetings cards and even encouraged her to fabricate symptoms so he could be sent round to see her out-of-hours.

But the mother-of-four began to feel 'used' and in December 2010 used her mobile phone to make two lengthy tape recordings of what were supposed to be check-ups, but instead saw her perform sex acts upon him.

On one, he is heard to say 'Ah come here' followed by the sound of kissing and heavy breathing, while on the second, after a period without dialogue, Miss Tudor says 'I really enjoyed it' to which he responds 'I did as well'.

Yesterday the General Medical Council's disciplinary panel ruled that only striking Dr Robinson off the medical register would maintain public confidence in the profession.

Referring to Miss Tudor as 'Patient A', panel chairman Professor Denis McDevitt told the GP he hadn't shown remorse or insight into his behaviour.

'On the contrary, you have denied the allegation throughout, requiring Patient A to give evidence and to have the recordings of your misconduct with her to be played at the public hearing,' he added.

'Although full sexual intercourse did not take place, the panel regards the sexual acts which did take place between you and Patient A as having the same gravity as full sexual intercourse.

'Your interest in the relationship seems to have been essentially sexual gratification and the panel is of the view that the relationship was unequal and exploitative.'

It also found he had shown 'a reckless disregard for the principles in "Good Medical Practice"' as well as displaying dishonesty in arranging bogus appointments and falsifying Miss Tudor's medical records so they could meet up for sex.

He concluded: 'The panel accepts that you are a very capable GP who is highly respected throughout your local community.

'But in view of the combination of very serious sexual misconduct and dishonesty, it has determined that a period of suspension would not be sufficient to maintain public confidence in the medical profession, nor to declare and uphold proper standards of conduct and behaviour.'

Instead, it ruled that he should be struck off with immediate effect.

The hearing in Manchester earlier rejected Dr Robinson's claims the two tapes had been tampered with after hearing analysis by a forensics expert.

He also had to undress and show the panel members his naked torso after Miss Tudor described three moles - two of which tallied with her account.
