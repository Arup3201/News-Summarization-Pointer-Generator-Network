'Queen of celebrity' is not lifetime role - before Kim Kardashian there was Paris Hilton and now there is another glossy young female fighting for the crown.

A model and TV presenter known as the Mexican Kim Kardashian is hoping to dethrone the real Kim after gathering a huge support base on social media.

Jimena Sanchez, a 30 year-old Mexican model and TV presenter, is four years younger than Kim and works as a sports presenter for the Latin American division of Fox Sports, Fox Deportes.

But her real fame comes from the mass of social media attention that she gets, with one million followers on Twitter and also more than one million Facebook likes on her official page.

And despite her ability to talk sport as a presenter on the TV show, it is her looks that seem to be mainly to blame for her huge popularity.

There are thousands of montages available on the internet showing Jimena and Kim alongside each other for fans to make up their own mind about who looks the best.

Jimena isn't doing anything to stop the hysteria either.
