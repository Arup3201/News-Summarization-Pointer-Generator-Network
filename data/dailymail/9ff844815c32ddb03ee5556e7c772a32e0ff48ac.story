President Obama followed through on his threat to 'isolate' Russia for sending troops into the Ukraine against his wishes, suspending all military relations between the two countries on Monday.

All scheduled military exercises, meetings and port visits are now cancelled in light of what Mr Obama considers a violation of international law. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent 
troops into the Ukrainian sovereign region of Crimea over the weekend, 
claiming he was trying to protect ethnic Russians from 
'ultra-nationalistic forces' in the country. 

'We call on Russia to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine and for Russian forces in Crimea to return to their bases, as required under the agreements governing the Russia Black Sea Fleet,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement.

Kirby added that while there has been speculation in the media about U.S. ship movements in the region, the Pentagon has not changed 'military posture in Europe or the Mediterranean'.

President Obama is currently working to rally Western allies in a united front against Russia's recent incursion on the Ukraine.

'I spent the weekend talking to leaders across Europe, and I think the world is largely united in recognizing that the steps Russia has taken are a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty, their territorial integrity,' the president said.

Russia justified its invasion of the Crimea to the UN Security Council on Monday, with Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin saying 'legitimately elected officials' had asked Russia to intervene.

But U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power shot back, saying the move was 'not a consensual intervention...it is an act of aggression'.

Russia's invasion of the Ukraine has been in response to the 2014 revolution which resulted in the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Moscow.

President Putin told German Chancellor Angela Merkel that he sent troops into the Crimea to protect the ethnic Russians in the region from 'ultranationalistic forces'. About 60 per cent of those living in Crimea are ethnic Russians.

But Russian forces seem to be acting as more than just peace keepers in the region.

On Monday, Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman Maksim Prauta announced that four Russian navy ships were blocking an anti-submarine warship and command ship and had ordered the crews to surrender or face seizure. Russian authorities have denied the incident.

A source at the Defense Ministry told Interfax that the deadline to surrender was 5am Tuesday, but another source said no assault was planned and 'this is complete nonsense'.

If true, a U.S. State Department spokesman said this would be a 'dangerous escalation' on Russia's part, for which they would be held accountable. 

As of 6am local time Tuesday, there had been no military action by the Russian forces, according to the Kyiv Post.

Back at the White House, Mr Obama said he believes Russia is on the wrong side of history, and should prepare itself for the consequences if it decides to proceed with military action in Crimea.

'But what cannot be done is for Russia, with impunity, to put its soldiers on the ground and violate basic principles that are recognized around the world,' Obama said. 'And I think the strong condemnation it's received from countries around the world indicates the degree to which Russia's on the wrong side of history in this.'

President Obama said he is currently looking into ways to 'isolate' Russia including economic sanctions and restrictions on travel for Russian officials.

'What we are also indicating to the Russians is, if, in fact, they continue on trajectory that they're on, that we are examining a whole series of steps — economic, diplomatic — that will isolate Russia. and will have a negative impact on Russia's economy and its status in the world,' President Obama said.

He is also calling on Congress to approve an aid package for the Ukrainian government.

'One thing they can do right away is work with the administration to help provide a package of assistance to Ukraine, to the people, to the government,' Mr Obama said.

'At this stage, there should be unanimity among Democrats and Republicans … We should be able to come up with a unified position that stands outside of partisan politics. My expectation is that I'll be able to able to get Congress to work with us in order to be able to achieve that goal.'

But allies such as France believe there are few options beyond that. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Russia's control of Crimea would not be easy to resolve.

President Obama's latest comments come as he meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House this week.

Tomorrow, Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Kiev, where he will further relay Mr Obama's message of Ukrainian sovereignty.

The president spoke with Putin on Friday for 90 minutes, but his Russian counterpart did not  take Mr Obama's advice to stay out of the region.

So far the U.S. has suspended prep meetings for the upcoming G-8 Summit in Sochi, Russia and declined to send a delegation to the Paralympic Winter Games - also in Sochi.
