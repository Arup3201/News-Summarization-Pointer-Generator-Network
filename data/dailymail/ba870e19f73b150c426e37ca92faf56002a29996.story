A sleepy English bulldog named Roxanne is being called a hero after waking up her owners by barking while the house around them burned.

A fire started early Monday morning in the Long Island home of Roxanne's owners, Michael and Susan Herlihy, quickly erupting into a blaze that required the help of firefighters from five towns, reports Newsday.

Huntington Fire Chief Robert Berry says the fire started shortly before 1:30 a.m. while the family was asleep.

Alert: 'Hero' bulldog Roxanne snoozes with her owner Kevin Herlihy, who she woke by barking when their Long Island home caught fire

Five-year-old Roxanne was in bed with Kevin, the Herlihys' adult son, when the house began to catch flame.

Roxanne kept barking until Kevin woke up and went to alert his parents. The family called 911 and fled the house.

The first fire officials arrived within minutes.

'Upon arrival, we had fire through the roof,' Berry said.

Nearly 50 firefighters coming from Huntington and neighboring Long Island towns worked for 90 minutes to extinguish the blaze.

Investigators currently believe it was an electrical fire.

'Shaken' by the fire, Kevin revealed the identity of the family's savior to Berry, who 'thought that was great.'

Pets often take action in an emergency, as a pit bull in Indianapolis proved last month when he woke his deaf owner with 'warming kisses' to save him from a fire, according to the Daily News.

In photos posted on Kevin's Facebook, Roxanne is often seen dozing in bed or lounging around, but when the moment called for action, she wasn't caught napping.

The family will have to do without their hero hound while the house is rebuilt, as neighbor Michael Marcinik told Newsday that the hotel where the Herlihys are staying does not allow pets.
