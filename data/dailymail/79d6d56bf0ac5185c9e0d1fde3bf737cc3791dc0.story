This blackened wardrobe was set ablaze by a drunk and stoned teenager at a  chaotic drug-fuelled birthday party, leading to the death of three young children and their older brother.

Pyromaniac Dyson Allen, 19, had been drinking vodka since lunchtime after joining Michelle Smith’s family and friends at her 36th birthday celebrations.

He was preparing to light a cannabis pipe or ‘bong’ when he started the fatal fire in a bedroom.

Tragic: Emergency services were called to the house fire on Lytham Road in Freckleton just before 11.30pm on January 7 2012 where they found four siblings unconscious in a bedroom

Scene: Four-year-old Holly and Ella Smith's bedroom where Dyson Allen is believed to have started the fire which killed them and their two brothers

Miss Smith’s 19-year-old son Reece 
tried to rescue his siblings – four-year old-twins Holly and Ella and 
two-year-old brother Jordan, who were upstairs asleep – but all four 
were overcome by smoke.

Yesterday
Allen was cleared of murder but convicted of four counts of 
manslaughter and told he faced ‘a substantial prison sentence’.

As
the verdicts were read out, members of Miss Smith’s family shouted 
‘Yes!’, but a woman believed to be Allen’s mother called out: ‘It’s all 
her fault. If she had not had that party, none of this would have 
happened.'

Miss Smith has given birth to her ninth child since the tragedy, and the four children who died had three different fathers.

She
had been celebrating her birthday at her home in Freckleton, 
Lancashire, in January last year, Allen’s trial was told.

Members of the
group spent the afternoon drinking and smoking cannabis, Neil Flewitt 
QC told Preston Crown Court. ‘As a result, the recollection of most of 
the witnesses is affected, by some extent, by drink and in some cases by
drugs in the form of cannabis,’ he said.

Allen, a mechanic, was a friend of the family and kept some belongings in the younger children’s room after staying at the house.

Miss Smith allowed teenagers to smoke cannabis in an outside building known as ‘the chamber’, the court heard.

Allen had been ‘drunk or stoned’ and later in the evening had been preparing ‘a mix’ for a bong marked ‘killer’ in which to smoke cannabis.

Miss Smith was alerted by Allen running downstairs shouting ‘Fire!’, at which Reece went to try to rescue his siblings. Smoke alarms had been fitted on the stairs, but Reece had taken them down in the days before the fire because one or both ‘kept making beeping noises’.

Allen denied starting the fire, saying he was looking for a friend upstairs when he noticed an ‘orange glow’ under the door.

But police were immediately suspicious, knowing he had been the only adult upstairs at the time.

An expert told the trial the fire had probably been started by clothes in the wardrobe being set alight.

It emerged that Allen had set fires as a schoolboy and was known to police. A friend told the trial how the pair would regularly start fires.

Trial judge Mr Justice Males remanded Allen in custody, telling him that a ‘substantial prison sentence is inevitable’.

After the verdicts, Miss Smith, now 
37, and Reece’s father, Martin Goulding, said in a statement: ‘We’ll 
never know the reason our children were taken away from us.

‘We would like to pay tribute to 
Reece, who paid the ultimate price for trying to rescue his brothers and
sisters and for that we will be eternally grateful and proud.’

Allen, of no fixed address, will be sentenced in September.
