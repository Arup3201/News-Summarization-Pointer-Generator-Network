A boy of two had to wait more than ten hours in an accident and emergency department for treatment to a gash on his head.

Alex Bellis was taken to casualty at 9pm on Saturday after he fell and cut his head on a wrought iron table.

But he was not seen until 7am the next morning, when medics said the gash had ‘healed itself’ and sent him home with Calpol. Last night Alex’s grandfather, Stuart Roberts, 64, said the youngster’s experience was ‘disgusting’.

‘A two-year-old should not be waiting for ten hours to be seen,’ he said. ‘It’s not right. That kind of wait is ridiculous.

‘I know the nurses and doctors work hard, but it just isn’t good enough.’

The accident happened while the family was at a restaurant in Chester. Alex was climbing on a chair when he slipped and fell, cutting the back of his head on the metal table.

His parents, Ceri Roberts, 26, and 27-year-old Dean Bellis, a refuse collector, initially took their son to nearby Countess of Chester Hospital.

But they were told there was a four-hour wait and doctors agreed to let them take their son to Wrexham Maelor Hospital, which is closer to their home in Coedpoeth, north Wales, in the hope he would be seen sooner.

When they arrived there, a triage nurse told the couple Alex’s cut would need to be ‘glued’, which is an alternative to having stitches.

She reassured them it was a ‘two-minute job’, but Alex was not seen by a doctor until the next morning.

Miss Roberts, a full-time mother who is pregnant, said: ‘My partner Dean and I were passing Alex back and forth.

‘He was uncomfortable but eventually went to sleep, although we didn’t. I’m 21 weeks pregnant so sleeping is uncomfortable enough as it is. It was ridiculous. A lot of people, when they were told of the wait, simply got up and left, but we didn’t want to take any chances.

‘They were apologetic, but it was shocking that we were made to wait so long.’

A nurse at Wrexham Maelor Hospital said Alex needed his head glued whcih she says was a 'two-minute job' - but he was not seen until 7am the next day, when he was sent home with Calpol 

She added: ‘Whether other patients were going straight in to see a doctor I’ve no idea, but it didn’t even seem that busy to me.

‘We only saw a couple of drunk people arrive in the early hours. It wasn’t heaving like you would expect on a Saturday night. We couldn’t understand it.’ Professor Matthew Makin, of Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which runs Wrexham Maelor Hospital, said: ‘We wish to apologise to Alex and his family for their long wait.

‘Saturday night was exceptionally busy, with a higher than normal number of patients attending the emergency department.

‘Each patient was assessed by the triage nurse and seen by medical staff in order of clinical need. We would be happy to discuss these concerns with the family.’ There has been growing concern over waiting times in the NHS in Wales, which is run separately from services in England.

Last week coroner John Gittins demanded urgent action from health bosses following the death of 73-year-old Clive Turner, who waited five hours for an ambulance and a further two hours in the same A&E department at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, before being mis-diagnosed by doctors.
