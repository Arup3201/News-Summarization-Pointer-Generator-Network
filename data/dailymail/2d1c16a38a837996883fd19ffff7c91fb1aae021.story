By now, most people will be panicking over how to fund the festive period, but if money was no option, there would be worse places to spend Christmas than this £2,500-a-night holiday let in Petworth, West Sussex.

Cornucopia is set in 40-acres of private parkland - which is maintained by a groundsman who lives on site.

Life of luxury: This is the spectacular seven-bedroom £2,500-a-night Cornucopia in Petworth, West Sussex, which includes a boating lake, pictured, in its grounds

An ideal place to spend Christmas morning: One of several tastefully 
decorated relaxing spaces in the property - which comes with an open 
fire

Slumber: The home has seven bedrooms, one of which pictured, all with king-sized beds and en suite bathrooms with free-standing baths

A bath with a view! Holiday makers could relax in the bath while looking over the 40-acre estate which includes a tennis court and swimming pool - pictured

The four-storey property, featured on Unique Home Stays, has seven beautifully decorated bedrooms with views over the private grounds, king-size beds and en suite bathrooms.

On the first floor sits the grand master suite 
which has not one but TWO en suite bathrooms with stand-alone 
bath tubs, walk-in rain showers, and floor-to-ceiling windows showcasing views across the Sussex countryside.

The second floor has four bedrooms at the top of a grand staircase that would give Downton Abbey a run for its money - each with a four-poster bed, en suite with bath tub and shower, and a quirky 
mezzanine snug area.

On the first floor there is also a 
French-style bedroom, plus an additional 
king-size room.

A good night's rest! Another of the luxurious property's bedrooms - which has a small lounge area in an adjoining room, pictured, and is decorated in stylish neutral tones

High quality: Another of the home's bathrooms - which includes an enormous walk-in shower and wet room plus another well-located bath tub

Stylish: Many of the rooms in Cornucopia have four-poster beds, like this one pictured that is also finished in a modern style

A professional chef can also be requested - which would certainly take the pressure off on Christmas morning.

Although the stylish marble kitchen may be enough to persuade even the most reluctant chef to give cooking a go.

Or if not, rather than slaving away over the turkey, the hirer could be working up a sweat in the gym - or perhaps relaxing in the hot tub and sauna.

And rather than playing charades for the millionth time once all the feasting is done, the whole family could enjoy a game of ten-pin bowling.

Catering for everyone: The kitchen is finished with marble work surfaces and includes a glass breakfast bar. A chef may be hired to cook for holidaymakers

Eating in style: Cornucopia's in-kitchen dining table gives stunning views across the grounds and the boating lake, pictured

Formal affair: Those spending Christmas at the home will be sitting round this fabulous 14-seater dining table, set in one of the more elaborately decorated rooms

Serious fun! There is plenty of entertainment at the property - including this bowling alley plus a games room including air hockey and a snooker table

There is also a cinema room with wide-screen television as well as several beautifully decorated lounge and reception rooms with surround sound entertainment systems.

There is also a games room - with full size 
snooker table, pin-ball and air-hockey table that leads on to a wine cellar.

But the impressive interior is not the only remarkable thing about this property.

In the grounds there is a private lake and jetty with row boats, outdoor swimming pool, trampoline and tennis courts.

A lot of bubbles: Holidaymakers may relax in this jacuzzi during their stay or, for the more active, there is a fully equipped gym, pictured

Work hard, play hard: One of the bedrooms has a balcony mezzanine, which holidaymakers could use to do a spot of work over the festive period

The property is located a stone's throw away from the South Downs National Park -  area of outstanding beauty.

The
 cathedral city of Winchester is also close by as is the market town of 
Lewes, should the let not provide enough entertainment already.

Despite it's exterior, Cornucopia is actually a new-build - with the owner knocking down a small holding to make way for the property.

The holiday let took three years to build, with the owner working hard to make it fit is with its surroundings.

Architecture: The four-storey house includes several visually interesting features, including this amazing arched sky light

Estate: The home is set within a large country estate and has areas of landscaped garden, pictured, as well as  a tennis court, outdoor seating areas and a boating lake

Messing about on the river: Adventurous visitors to the grounds may fancy a go in either of these two rowing boats

The owner said: 'Fortunately the house was not listed and had no preservation orders attached.

'It was surrounded by 23 acres of once beautifully landscaped grounds with majestic ancient oak trees and its potential was huge.'

Prices begin at £9995 for a three-night weekend stay in low season, rising to £12,500 for five days in high season.

Outdoor living: Next to the large, heated outdoor pool is a Moroccan-style seating area with several comfortable sofas, low tables and candle lamps, pictured

Pricey visit: The extraordinary property costs £9,995 for three nights or £12,500 for five during peak seasons and Christmas
