She said she wanted to live a farmer’s life, and bought the cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens and geese to prove it.

But it seems Liz Hurley has finally tired of all that rustic simplicity.

The actress and model has put her secluded Cotswolds farm on the market – and is set to make a £3million profit from the sale.

Six-bedroom Ampney Knowle has all the rural charm you would expect from a stone-built farmhouse set in 73 acres of green fields – ‘The Darling Buds of May all the way,’ says Miss Hurley.

But inside, it has the unmistakeable marks of a celebrity owner.

There’s the obligatory Aga in a vast Smallbone kitchen and a huge portrait of Miss Hurley and her 12-year-old son Damian in the lounge.

But in the bedroom, things start to get odd. Perching on its hind legs is what appears to be a miniature stuffed alligator seemingly keeping an eye on a nearby four-poster bed.

The animal theme continues in the sitting room. Anybody wanting to play the grand piano has a dead tiger to contend with – its mouth wide open, baring its fangs.

Nearby, a glass coffee table is supported by two topless figures. Outside is a tennis court and a garden filled with flowers.

For a woman who is regularly photographed on the red carpet, Miss Hurley naturally has converted one of Ampney Knowle’s outbuildings into a ‘party barn’.

She has thrown many parties, with guests able to stay in the ‘guest annexe’, a converted Cotswold stone stable block with three ensuite bedrooms and a large sitting room.

Ampney Knowle, which has six bedrooms in the main house, also has two separate cottages and outbuildings. The 31-acre bluebell wood and 35 acres of farmland are not included, however.

Sculpted: The home includes well-kept gardens, and an outbuilding used for parties

Annexe: The home includes a separate area in which visitors can stay in privacy

Approach: Miss Hurley once put the surrounding farmland to good use - then her interest waned

Distant: Miss Hurley's country paradise began to fade when her ex-husband tired of being far from the city

Miss Hurley, 48, expects the estate – being sold by estate agency Knight Frank – to sell for £6million.

She bought it 11 years ago for £3.3million as she started dating her ex-husband, textile billionaire Arun Nayar.

Describing the moment she first saw Ampney Knowle, Miss Hurley said: ‘[It was] the most perfect June day, a few months after I’d given birth to my son, Damian. The moment I stepped over the threshold, I knew I wanted to live here.’

For a time, the model embraced the farm life, stocking the estate with four labradors, two cats, three geese, eight chickens, 49 cows, 63 sheep and 82 pigs. She even began stocking her own sausages in Harrods.

Luxury: The bathroom fits the rest of the house's nuetral decor

Snug: Rooms higher in the house have authentic exposed wooden beams

Fine dining: The separate dining room has commanding views over the surrounding fields

But she gradually outgrew her rural idyll. Mr Nayar reportedly disliked living so far from the big city, and her interest in farming waned.

Miss Hurley said: ‘I’ll miss sitting round the fire cackling with my friends, walking through the fields with my son, and the rose garden I created. But I’m taking my memories with me, so I’ll be OK.’

She now lives at Doddington Hall, a Georgian mansion in Herefordshire she bought with Shane Warne. When their relationship foundered last year, Miss Hurley – who is now dating hedge fund tycoon-turned-wildlife photographer David Yarrow - decided to buy Mr Warne’s share and stay on.
