For most of us, buying a baby bottle and dummy would mean parting with around a tenner, but for some mega-wealthy mums, mere plastic just won't do for the most precious person in their life.

So what better (and more bizarre) way to spoil a tiny tot than with baby bottle costing a whopping £166,000 and an £83,000 matching dummy?

We hope that the 18 karat pink gold and diamonds would survive the steriliser.

Don't throw your toys out the pram!: The £166,000 baby bottle and £83,000 dummy made from 18 k gold and diamonds

The bottles come in five different sizes, starting at £83,00 for the 25ml version to £166,000 for the 200ml style. And buyers can spoil their little ones even more by customising them with an engraving.

The Dodo Dummy also comes with a hanging 
chain for mum, a baby chain and a brooch accessory so mothers can keep 
it with them at all times. And let's face it you wouldn't want to lose it!

The bottles, made by luxury baby brand Suommo, who also design cots, cribs and changers, were inspired by Russian dolls and were created by the firm’s most experienced jewellers.

Potential buyers can spoil their children even more by customising the bottles, which are made from pink gold and come complete with white gold and diamonds

A spokesperson for the luxury firm said, 'The glamorous pink gloss gives it a 
tender look which captures the hearts of parents from the 
first second they set their sights on it.

'Our creations are real works of art, and they go beyond time thanks to an exclusive and elegant sense of beauty.

The bottles come in 5 different sizes starting at £83,000 for a 25ml bottle to £166,00 for the 200 ml version

'As a brand, our goal is to meet and exceed the wishes of the most demanding parents.

'Therefore, our pieces distil a sense of luxury and refinement which is present in the slightest details.

'Our most experienced jewellers sculpted this pink gold piece with white gold and diamonds.'

One thing's for sure, at a few hundred thousand a pop, you'll make sure your baby won't be throwing these toys out their cot.
