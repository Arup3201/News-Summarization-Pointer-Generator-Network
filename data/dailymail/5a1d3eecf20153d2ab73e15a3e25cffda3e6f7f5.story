A neurosurgeon who was known to be addicted to cocaine and linked to the death of two prostitutes was allowed to continue practicing precise surgeries, ruining the lives of some of his trusting patients as he spiralled downhill.

Dr Suresh Nair was eventually jailed for four years after he plead guilty to one count of manslaughter and two counts of supplying cocaine, a joint investigation by the ABC and Fairfax has revealed.

The Malaysian-born doctor will now be deported back to his home country after his permanent residency was cancelled, but during his negligent stint at the Nepean Private hospital in Sydney's west, Dr Nair caused a life-time of damage to a number of his patients.

Dr Suresh Nair was allowed to continue working as a neurosurgeon at the Nepean Private Hospital despite the NSW Medical Council being aware of his addiction to cocaine since 2004

Carla Downes, who Dr Nair operated on three times, told the ABC that in her second operation Dr Nair operated at the wrong level of her spine, leading to seven years of constant pain and  leaving her unable to walk up a flight of stairs.

In February 2009, a 23-year-old sex worker, Victoria McIntyre, died of a cocaine overdose after a night at the neurosurgeon's apartment

Another patient, Rhonda Taylor, told Fairfax that her mishandled spinal fusion, performed by Dr Nair in 2009, had ‘taken [her] life away’.

Their testimonials have come after revelations that the NSW Medical Council and both the private and public Nepean hospitals were aware of Dr Nair’s cocaine addiction since 2004, when he was suspended for six weeks after a urine test found traces of cocaine in his system. 

However the Medical Board deemed it safe to stop performing drug tests on the surgeon in 2008, and despite the Nepean Public Hospital maintaining the former decision to ban him from performing surgeries, their private counterpart allowed him back into the operating theatre.

At the time, Dr Nair was spending tens of thousands of dollars on prostitutes and hosting small drug parties in his home, according to the ABC.

Even his co-workers, fellow neurosurgeons, began expressing doubts at Dr Nair's ability 'to function as a consultant' at this point, with one person describing his surgical decisions as 'often bizarre', Fairfax reports.

Patients who the Malaysian-born surgeon operated on have revealed they have were left with life-long problems after his surgeries went wrong

Dr Nair was arrested in 2010 following the death of a second escort at his home. 19-year-old Suellen Domingues-Zaupa, died after suffering a cardiac arrest from a cocaine overdose

While the hospital was informed of the incident, the NSW Medical Council was not, and Dr Nair continued to work.

Later in the same year, 19-year-old escort Suellen Domingues-Zaupa, also died at Dr Nair's home after suffering a cardiac arrest from a cocaine overdose.

Finally, after this incident, Dr Nair was arrested and his medical licence was revoked in 2010.The full media investigation can be seen on Monday at 8:30pm on ABC's Four Corners.
