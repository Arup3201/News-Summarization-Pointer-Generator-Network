It's safe to say he probably isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.

A 24-year-old man from Vienna, Austria, attempted to rob a city bank yesterday armed with nothing but a stainless silver spoon.   

The unnamed man walked in to the bank demanding cash and pretended he had a knife  - but bank staff immediately spotted he was just carrying a dessert spoon.

They called the police and refused to hand over any money to the would-be robber.

The man entered a bank branch just before 4pm in Weintraubengasse in the 2nd district yesterday afternoon, walked straight over to the cashier and demanded  money.

He seemed to be under the impression that the spoon would be mistaken for a knife, reports The Local. 

The cashier pretended he was going to get some cash and instead called the police.

The man sat down in the waiting area and was still sat there patiently when police found and arrested him.

Witnesses told the English language newspaper that no one took the man seriously.

He is currently being held in prison and said he did it because he needed the money.
