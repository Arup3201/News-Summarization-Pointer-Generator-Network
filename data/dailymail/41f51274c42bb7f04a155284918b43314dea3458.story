Despite it being perceived as posh, the Queen's English has been named Britain's favourite accent

It is the unmistakable sound of the Queen and old BBC newsreels.

And despite being perceived as a little posh, received pronunciation (RP) is still our favourite accent.

For a survey has found that the Queen's English is most associated with nine out of ten positive character traits, including attractiveness, intelligence, honesty, charm, sophistication and reliability.

The only category where it falls short is in humour where it came only eleventh with the Geordie lilt sounding most fun ahead of Liverpudlian, Irish, Cornish and Essex.

The  eHarmony.co.uk experiment involving 750 participants listening to sound clips of men and women with 19 different international and regional accents and scoring what they believed of the person based on 10 character traits.

The poll also identified a phenomenon dubbed the 'Cheryl Cole factor' where celebrities shape our preconceptions about accents.

Despite the reputation of French and Italian men, RP is the real language of love - as well as many other things.

Edinburgh came second overall ahead of Australian, southern Irish, Yorkshire and American. They were followed by Geordie, Mancunian, Glaswegian and Welsh.

French was ranked only 16th for attractiveness and Italian came in only slightly higher at 13th. French performed better in the 'romantic' category but was still only placed third behind RP and Edinburgh.

More than one-in-five (22 per cent) admitted the allure of some accents is so strong they have actually gone on a date because of it - and seven percent have 'played up' how they speak because they believed it sounded attractive.

Professor Jane Setter, a phoneticist at Reading University, said: 'RP speakers have been rated highly in terms of intelligence - and the accent itself as attractive - since studies like this began.

'Actors with this accent - like Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation), Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey) and Richard E. Grant (Withnail and I) - come over as urbane, charming, witty and educated and - well - wouldn't everyone want that from a prospective romantic partner?

'The Edinburgh accent is also associated with culture and intelligence - think Sean Connery or David Tennant and you're already swept off your feet.

The poll also identified a phenomenon dubbed the 'Cheryl Cole factor', in which celebrities shape our preconceptions about accents

'However, comedians are rarely RP speakers and so it is no surprise to see it rated less highly in that respect; Sarah Millican (Geordie) and John Bishop (Liverpool) spring to mind as wonderfully funny, articulate people.

'Our preconceptions and love of certain lilts, drawls and tones when it comes to accents is mostly down to experience and stereotyping.

1. Received pronunciation (RP)

2. Edinburgh

3. Australian

4. Irish (Republic of Ireland)

5. Yorkshire

6. American

7. Geordie

8. Mancunian

9. Glaswegian

10. Welsh

'This helps to explain why RP scores so highly across all categories - it's the accent we associate with trusted newsreaders plus it continues to be used as the model for teaching English as a foreign language.

'In terms of other accents which were rated highly for attractiveness - again stereotyping is at play. Across the pond we see Americans as colourful and international so they're 'interesting', Yorkshire folk are seen as down to earth and honest and the Irish have 'kissed the Blarney stone' and are celebrated as charming and quick witted.

'In terms of French and Italian not faring so well this could simply be down to a lack of familiarity with their unique inflections.'

Jemima Wade, spokesperson for eHarmony.co.uk, said: 'After spending time getting to know each other online the first time you meet and say 'hello' on a date is a special, exciting moment.

'Yet while accents may be appealing at first - sparking initial interest and attraction - happy long-term relationships are about far more than that.'
