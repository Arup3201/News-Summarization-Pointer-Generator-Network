Lee Mairs, 24, died after falling during a stag party trip to Tenerife, an inquest heard

A British tourist who died on a stag party trip to Tenerife may have fallen 12 feet off a hotel balcony after a fight, an inquest heard.

Electrician Lee Mairs, 24, who had flown to the Canary island with a group of 22 friends to celebrate the imminent wedding of his friend Chris Booth, 29, suffered a fractured skull and bleed to the brain after falling onto some concrete steps outside his hotel in Playa de las Americas.

Mr Mairs, from Stockport, was found under his first floor apartment window by another holidaymaker who heard 'coughing and spluttering' coming from the ground.

He was rushed to hospital in Santa Cruz but his life support machine was later switched off.

An inquest into his death heard that his room at the Hacienda del Sol hotel had been ransacked, with two beds tipped onto their sides, kitchen cupboards and the fridge door open, and a smashed tumbler lying on the floor.

Yet nothing was missing, and Mr Mairs' iPhone and iPod docking station were still in the room.

Mr Mairs died in June last year, after a night out with his friends in the resort's nightlife strip.

The inquest heard from his friend and hotel room-mate Steven Haley, who said that he last saw Mr Mairs in Yates' Bar wearing a hat he'd bought from a street vendor.

He said: 'Lee was dancing on a table and playing Air Guitar and having a laugh.'

Mr Haley, a joiner, said he left the bar at around midnight and headed back to the hotel, where he saw a flipflop belonging to Mr Mairs.

He said when he got back to their room he could not find the key they'd hidden, so he climbed in through a window.

Mr Haley said he saw Mr Mairs' phone on the floor, and then noticed that the beds were upended, and the room was in a mess, although no valuables had been taken.

He said another holidaymaker told him that Mr Mairs had been taken away in an ambulance, so he went to the reception desk where a member of staff told him that the situation had been dealt with and the police were not needed.

He claimed staff told him: 'No police needed - your friend was drunk and fell off the balcony.'

Mr Haley said: 'One of the times he 
was saying he had been attacked outside the hotel, another time he told 
me he had had a fight, each time was a different version from the same 
person in such a short space of time.'

Mr Haley said that when the police did arrive the following day, they 'decided in minutes what had happened'.

The Spanish authorities registered Mr Mairs' death as an accident, saying he had fallen from the balcony, but his family do not believe they carried out a full investigation, the inquest heard.

Mr Haley also told the inquest that one of the stag party guests became upset and 'emotional' after the tragedy.

He said he asked Ross Collett what had happened with Mr Mairs in Tenerife and said:  'He wouldn't answer me, so I asked him again.

'He was crying, he said "He hit me, it went off".  As I took it, Lee had hit [the guest] and something had occurred in retaliation.'

However the inquest was told Mr Collett denied making the comments, and said that he had been drunk.

Recording an open verdict, Coroner John Pollard said there was insufficient evidence to decide how Mr Mairs died that night.

He said it was possible he had been assaulted on the way back to the hotel and then fell again, or that he fell from the balcony. He said he could have been assaulted at the hotel and fallen over.

The coroner added: 'Then there is the possibility a combination of these things happened. We cannot prove it one way or the other.'
