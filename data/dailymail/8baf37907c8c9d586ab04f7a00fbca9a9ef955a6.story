What could be cuter than a tiny orphaned sea otter? A tiny orphaned sea otter that is learning to swim.

The newest resident of Chicago's Shedd Aquarium, known as Pup 681, has become an instant celebrity, causing Internet users the world over to squeal with delight at the sight of her adorable antics.

But it has not been all fun and games for the staff at the aquarium who have been working around the clock to teach the furry critter, who was found abandoned on a California beach in September, how to be a proper otter.

The aquarium has released a heart-melting video showing staffers giving Pup 681 swimming lessons. 

In the 4-minute clip, the fluffy mammal is dipped into a small rectangular pool on her back under the watchful eyes of experts.

The video also shows the infant otter being carefully dried with a towel, cuddled and fed from a bottle like a new-born baby.

The abandoned orphan currently weighs under 6lbs and measures 22.6 inches in length.

For now, Pup 681 will be kept away from other otters housed in the visible section of the aquarium as she learns to groom herself, forage for food and eat on her own, Washington Post reported. 

She is kept on a strict diet of formula and small solid foods like shrimp and chopped clams.

In due time, the pup will be moved to Shedd's Regenstein Sea Otter Nursery. 

The pup was discovered on Coastways Beach in central California by a jogger four weeks ago, and immediately taken to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for care.

The southern sea otter was  severely underweight and had been abandoned by her mother at least 16 hours prior to being discovered workers there said, so it was immediately a rush to get her fed and healthy.

Workers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium spent four weeks getting the pup healthy again

After four weeks of intensive care and stabilization in Monterey Bay's Sea Otter Program, the now 5-week-old pup, whose name is currently Pup 681, was transferred to her new home - in Chicago.

Monterey Bay Aquarium reached out to aquariums in search of a facility that could provide necessary care for the pup, and the Shedd Aquarium in the Windy City answered their call.

'It truly takes a village to rehabilitate a young sea otter,' Tim Binder, the aquarium's vice president, told the Chicago Tribune.

'Our animal care team is teaching the pup how to be an otter.'

Now, the 5-week-old otter is heading to her new home at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago

She spends her days swimming, playing with felt and drinking formula filled with minced clams

And Pup 681 seems to love her new surroundings, swimming around, playing with felt and enjoying meals of formula with minced clams.

She is also learning how to feed and bathe herself.

Best of all however, staff at the aquarium is hard at work picking out a name for the new lady in their lives.
