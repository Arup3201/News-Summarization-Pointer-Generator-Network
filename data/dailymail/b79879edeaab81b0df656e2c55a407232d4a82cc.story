Kell Brook cranked up his war of words with Amir Khan by declaring himself 'willing to die' in order to put an end to the decade-long feud with his British welterweight enemy.

There are few more bitter rivalries in world boxing than the one between 28-year-old Brook and Bolton's Khan, who both now campaign at the 147lb limit but are yet to face each other in the ring, with the exception of a heated sparring session.

But Brook strengthened his chances of landing a money-spinning clash with Khan by winning the IBF title in August, via decision against American Shawn Porter, and has continued to call him out since.

Brook hopes he can set up a British super-fight against Amir Khan for later in the year

The 28-year-old explained: 'I'm the champion so he should be chasing me now. But the reason why I'm still mentioning him is because since I was 18 years old when I turned professional, every conversation and interview I've had his name has always come up.

'I want to put it to bed and prove to everyone in Britain that I'm No 1. Even though I am the No 1 in the world I want to show that he's not on my level.

'The night I fight Amir Khan, a bit of my soul will be left in that ring. I'm willing to die in that ring just to prove all of this talk right. I will be leaving a bit of me in that ring that night.'

Brook's promoter, Eddie Hearn, offered Khan £3million to fight his charge last year and revealed in his Sportsmail column that he would be willing to offer him even more to make the fight in 2015 and has even booked Wembley Stadium in the summer with that showdown in mind.

Hearn agreed late on Wednesday night for Brook to face Canada-based Romanian Jo Jo Dan in the first defence of his title in Sheffield on March 28. What's more, Dan is Brook's mandatory challenger which means he will be free to pursue any fight he chooses once he takes care of the IBF's allocated No.1 contender.

A voluntary defence in March would have left Brook obligated to fight Dan in the summer which would have ended hopes of an all-British megafight with Khan in June, which could generate the same nationwide appeal as Carl Froch's fight with George Groves at Wembley last May.

But first Brook must take care of Dan and he admits it is easy to look past him, with such lucrative fights on the horizon. He conceded: 'It is difficult because you look at those massive names and massive fights that you've dreamed of as a young kid growing up.

'But I'm among them now. There are three men out there with belts in this division – one is Manny Pacquiao, one is Floyd Mayweather and one is Kell Brook. I'm at the highest table in the hottest division and can be involved in some massive fights.

'But you've got to take care of business, if you don't get past this obstacle in front of you, you know you won't get to those fights. You've just got to concentrate on what is in front of you.'

The homecoming fight at Sheffield's Motorpoint Arena will be tinged with emotion as it will be Brook's first outing since an horrific machete attack during a holiday to Tenerife in September left him fearing for his life.

But after making a full recovery, Brook says he is using the trauma to spur him on.

He said: 'I remember being laid in Tenerife being next to a red-hot window and nobody in the hospital even speaking English and I was there with my leg tied up thinking 'will I ever walk again?'

'From winning that world title, going from cloud nine to laying in that hospital bed it has been a rollercoaster. But the fact is, I'm here now and it's been a long time. But I'm back now at 100mph doing everything I could before the attack.

'I've put it behind me. It was a chapter of the Kell Brook story and now I don't let it get to me. I turn a negative into a positive. I'm lucky to be here and looking at my kids. I'm fit and well and I will get on with what I've got to get on with.

'The knife attack has really pushed me on but it is about earning a few quid now. I want to prove to everyone that it was not a fluke or a one-off, I'm the real deal. I was born for this.'
