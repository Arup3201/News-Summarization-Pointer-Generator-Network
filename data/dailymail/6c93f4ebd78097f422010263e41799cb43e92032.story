These CCTV images show the last healthy moments of a three-year-old girl skipping through a supermarket door to buy sweets, before she later died from a mysterious head injury.

Mariam Alam, of Coventry, West Midlands, was on the brink of death less than 20 minutes after this  footage was taken - and police have issued a fresh appeal for information one year after her death.

The little girl was taken to hospital by relatives after suffering the head injury and died despite the efforts of paramedics - but detectives are still not certain how or where she suffered the injury.

Last moments: Mariam Alam, of Coventry, West Midlands, was on the brink of death less than 20 minutes after the footage was taken - and police have issued a fresh appeal for information one year after her death

Supermarket entry: The West Midlands Police CCTV footage shows Mariam wearing a red flowery dress, white tights and a pink coat walking with her mother at a Lidl store in the Foleshill area of the city last November

‘We haven’t forgotten about Mariam,’ Detective Inspector Chris Hanson of Coventry Police said. ‘We’re still very interested in what happened to her. I’m determined to get to the bottom of it.’

The West Midlands Police CCTV footage shows Mariam wearing a red flowery dress, white tights and a pink coat walking with her mother at a Lidl store in the Foleshill area of the city last November.

Since her death, detectives have faced a wall of silence from some people while others have given wildly different accounts of how she was hurt, but they are appealing again to the local community.

Det Insp Hanson, from the public protection unit, said: ‘Mariam was very poorly when she arrived at hospital and died a short time later. At that stage paramedics didn’t know why she had collapsed.  

‘There was no obvious trauma or injuries. At first it was treated as an unexpected death.

‘We were unsure what had caused her to collapse, sometimes children can suddenly and unexpectedly become ill due to an infection or an underlying undiagnosed medical condition.’

Leaving: Twelve months later police still have more questions than answers about how the tragic toddler died

But the police probe took a turn when the post mortem exam - carried out as routine when a small child dies unexpectedly - found out that Mariam died as a result of a significant head injury.

The impact of the injury was so severe 
pathologists likened it to a hard fall from height or a heavy blow to 
the head. Police then launched an investigation into Mariam’s death.

But 12 months later they have more questions than answers about how the tragic toddler died. When witnesses were interviewed they offered differing accounts of the day she passed away.

Early investigations cast doubt on some versions of events and to this day officers cannot even be certain where Mariam suffered the fatal injury.

Det Insp Hanson said: ‘Less than 20 minutes after this CCTV image was taken in the nearby Lidl supermarket Mariam was on the brink of death.

‘We have built a picture of what was going on at the time but we’re still not sure where she was, whether she was deliberately hit or whether she had a fall.’

Location: Three-year-old Mariam Alam died in hospital in November 2011 after an ambulance was called to a house on this road in the Foleshill area of Coventry

He added that investigators believe people in the community know how she died but are reluctant to come forwards. ‘Very early on in the investigation we had an anonymous call,’ the officer said.

‘That person helped to point us in the right direction. We believe there is someone in the community who is desperate to tell us what happened to Mariam. They may be able to tell us a little bit more.

'We were unsure what had caused her to collapse. Sometimes children can suddenly and unexpectedly become ill due to an infection or an underlying undiagnosed medical condition'

Det Insp Chris Hanson, Coventry Police

‘We would appeal for that person to get back in touch.’

Police will today recreate Mariam’s last journey - made on November 30 last year at around 1pm.

They will visit the mosque near her home on Fisher Road in Foleshill and leaflet the area in an effort to jog people’s memories.

A 35-year-old man and two women, aged 32 and 25, were arrested in March and later bailed but to date no-one has been charged over the death.
