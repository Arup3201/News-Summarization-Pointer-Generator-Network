A man has been shot dead by police after he was seen on tracks in a subway tunnel. 

Police discovered the man around 400ft away from Potomac Avenue station in Washington at 9pm last night. 

They were called after a station worker reported an 'unauthorized person' on the tracks.

A female officer shot him multiple times ten minutes after arriving at the scene.

A Metro Transit Police spokesman said they had no details about the man, what he was doing in the tunnel or what prompted police to shoot him. 

They added the unnamed man was pronounced dead at the scene. Nobody else was hurt in the incident.  

This morning crime-scene technicians were seen carrying their equipment into the station. The station was closed for the night following the shooting but has now reopened.

The officer who shot the man has been made to take paid administrative leave, a routine procedure in the case of a shooting.
