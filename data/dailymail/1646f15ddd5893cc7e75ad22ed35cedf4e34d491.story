Female fighter Lou Ballard wants to crush her beauty queen rivals to become the first wrestler to be crowned Miss Great Britain.

Lou, 26, from Stubbington, Hants, spends six evenings a week working out in the gym, and four hours every Sunday wrestling to keep her body in shape for the national beauty contest.

Lou has even had a £250 red, white and 
blue bikini costume specially made for her in an attempt to help her 
stand out in front of the judges.

Lou has been a wrestling fan since she was eight years old and her idols are fighting celebrities like Hulk Hogan and Chyna

She said: ‘I want people to see that just because I am a weight-lifting wrestler, it doesn’t mean I am not in the running to take the title of Miss Great Britain.

‘It’s something different.

‘People have this image of very stereotypical, old-fashioned women, I thought wrestling would be a bit different.

‘I wrestle every Sunday and have no problem power-slamming 16-and-a-half-stone men.

‘I can do power squats with weights up to 65kg.

Lou was put through to the Miss Personality of Great Britain final as a wild card last year and beat 60 other contenders to take the title.

Coming out on top in that competition means she is able to compete in the Miss Great Britain pageant this year.

Lou, who wrestles men because of her 5ft 9in height, said: ‘There is a casual wear round, a bikini wear round and an evening wear round.

‘I am really lucky because the competition falls one day before my 27th birthday which is the cut-off age to enter Miss GB.

‘Everyone said I was really funny, quirky and lively last year. I chatted to everyone which is why I think I was crowned Miss Personality.

‘I am training hard at the moment to prepare myself for this year’s competition and am having lots of carbs and doing lots of cardio so I have a bikini-fit body to die for.’

The assistant stage manager added: ‘It wasn’t until I was 19 years old I met wrestler Chris Manns. He said for me to come and watch a show.

‘He helped me get into it and I haven’t looked back really.’

Mentor Chris, 35, from Gosport, Hants, who wrestles under the name of The Fearless Flatliner, said: ‘Lou is a class act who loves the sport. She has charisma, she is driven and she is tough.

‘If you look at her you might think ‘Hollyoaks and hair straighteners’ because she is so pretty but, trust me, she is a force to be reckoned with. I am so proud of her.’

Lou will be a contestant at the Miss Great Britain final in Leicester on November 15.
