Gerard Deulofeu admits he was surprised to be shown the exit at the Nou Camp for a second consecutive year after Barcelona sent the winger on loan to La Liga rivals Sevilla.

The 20-year-old, a Barca youth product, spent last season  in the Premier League with Everton, but was brought back to Spain at the end of his Goodison spell.

Nevertheless, Deulofeu insists he will make the most of his year with Sevilla, despite not being happy at new manager Luis Enrique sending him away from the four-time Champions League winners.

'I could be stronger with my defending, I'm going to work on that I hope that it's a better year than last, which wasn't bad but I failed to take that little step forward and I hope to be able to do it here,' he said.

'I want to have a good year because it's key for my career.'
