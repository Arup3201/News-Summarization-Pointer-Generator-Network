It may still be a bit too chilly for the smell of sizzling sausages to waft over the back garden fence, but this weekend with looks set to sunny and dry for most of Britain.

The prediction that temperatures in the south are set to hit a high of 17C this weekend will no doubt be welcome news to the thousands of people set to take part or watch the London Marathon on Sunday in the capital.

Experts at the Met Office said the dry and bright weather was expected to continue into early next week, with temperatures up to the mid-teens, but a reminder of winter set to return for the Easter weekend.

A Met Office spokesperson told MailOnline today: 'It's fairly typical spring weather for the time of year over the weekend.

'It will be mainly dry with some bright spells, although there will be a bit more cloud and showers in north-west and a few showers across the country as a whole.

'Similarly into Sunday it looks generally like a decent and dry day with a fair bit of cloud, although there could be showers likely in north.

Friday: A mostly dry day with sunny spells and light winds, although an isolated shower is possible.

Stronger winds and outbreaks of rain are expected to reach western Scotland by evening.

Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Often windy with rain or showers in northern parts of the UK.

Mostly dry and bright weather further south, however, thicker cloud and some light rain is possible at times.

'Going through the week the weather looks fairly settled.

'Looks like high pressure will start to move away at the end of the week and Thursday and Friday will be more unsettled,' he added.

'There will be a chance of showers along with spells of rain early next week, but by the time you get into Saturday and Sunday on Easter weekend there will be a split.

'The north-west will be cloudy and rainy while the south will be sunnier and warmer. 

Yesterday the Met Office tweeted to warn hayfever sufferers about a 'high' pollen count in the London area, and a 'medium' count for the rest of the country.

 The annual kid count will check how many youngsters have been born this year and if any have been born to females who have been given the birth control vaccine

Britain currently has one of the highest rates of hay fever in the world with about 25 per cent of the population suffering.

It is believed that the number of sufferers is likely to more than double to 32million by 2030.

If you are affected, it can be helpful to avoid going outside when the pollen count is high - normally from early to mid-morning - and to avoid cutting the grass.

According to the Met Office's latest report Britain is set for a six-week heatwave,

The report reads: 'Latest predictions for UK-mean temperature favour above-average temperatures for April and April-May as a whole.'
