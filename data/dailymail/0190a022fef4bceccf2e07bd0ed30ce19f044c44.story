Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s infamous big soda ban push appeared to have fizzled out until a new supporter emerged this week – current Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The new administration announced this week it is continuing the city’s appeal of the so-called ‘Big Gulp Ban’ being overturned last year.

A successful appeal would lead to all sugary drinks – soda, juice and even some coffee drinks – being banned from sale in the city.

Not lovin' it: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio plans to fight to enact former mayor Michael Bloomberg's big soda ban

It has been referred to by many as the ‘Big Gulp Ban,’ but it ironically does not affect the sale of sodas in places without health department grades. Convenience stores such as 7-Eleven are not subject to health department inspections.

Sugary coffee drinks served by the likes of Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks would also be affected.City lawyers will appear at a Court of Appeals hearing June 4 to argue their position, the New York Daily News first reported.

Mayor de Blasio has said in the past that he supports the idea of limiting the size of sodas in an effort to help combat diabetes and obesity.

A coalition of hospitals and minority advocacy groups also filed a brief in support of the city’s position, according to Capital New York.

‘The problem it addresses is perhaps the gravest and most pervasive public health issue of our time,’ said the filing.

The devil is in the details: The rule ironically does not affect soda sold in convenience stores despite being derisively called the 'Big Gulp Ban' by many

City Health Commissioner Mary Bassett echoed those words in an interview with CNY.

‘The fact is that we have this terrible epidemic underway and we have a responsibility in public health, all of us including the industry, to tackle this epidemic,’ she said.

‘If people drank 16 ounces rather than 20 ounces of soda, we’d be able to clock millions of pounds in weight reduction.’

Hizzoner also said that going the legislative route would be more preferable than a Health Department resolution such as the very one he is fighting to enact, the Daily News noted.

‘I think we could do a much better job of working with parents and working with communities to help them understand why this is a good idea and get their buy-in,’ said the mayor earlier this year.

The mayor appears to be failing on that front, as a recent Quinnipiac University poll showed that 57 per cent of New Yorkers opposed the ban and only 37 per cent supported it.

The ban was first struck down in March 2013 after an appeals court judge ruled then-Mayor Bloomberg overstepped his boundaries.

That ruling was then upheld in a later appeal.
