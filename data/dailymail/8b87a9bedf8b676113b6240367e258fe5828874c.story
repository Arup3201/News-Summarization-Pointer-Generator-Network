Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football.

THE BIG QUESTION – Wayne Rooney: in or out?

I reckon Roy Hodgson will pick Wayne and play him in a role behind Daniel Sturridge.

I think he’ll do a similar thing to Sir Alex Ferguson and play Rooney off the front and against Italy tell him to watch Andrea Pirlo.

Leader: Roy Hodgson is likely to select Wayne Rooney (above) behind Daniel Sturridge

He is Italy’s pass master, their 
catalyst, who wants to dictate and control the game. In the old days 
when the cavalries would ride into battle they used to target the 
general at the back, sitting on his white horse.

As soon as
 you got to him the attackers knew the rest of the soldiers would 
scarper without their leader. Pirlo is the general on that horse but the
 Italians are not renowned through history for being great battlers.

If Rooney and England can stop Pirlo, then I don’t think this Italian team will be up for the battle.

Maestro: England must stop Andrea Pirlo if they are to have any chance against Italy

MY ENGLAND SCOUTING REPORT

JOE HART             

Shows good body language and good distribution but can be poor on crosses, particularly from corners. Looks confident but at times he could be overconfident.

GLEN JOHNSON

Has been poor attacking in the final third in the friendlies and was not tested defensively one v one. He can be poor in possession and always looks like he’s got an error in his game.

GARY CAHILL

A strong, dominant header of the ball in both boxes. He is growing as a leader but he does lack a bit of pace in tight areas and can be average in possession

Safe hands: Joe Hart's confidence will help the team build from the back

Solid: Gary Cahill (left) and Phil Jagielka (right) are strong in the air but lack pace at the top level

PHIL JAGIELKA

A whole-hearted player and a leader. Attacks the ball well in the air at both ends and wants to score at set plays. His passing could be better but he is a fraction too slow to be top level.

LEIGHTON BAINES

Is average defending the far post from crosses and can be guilty of poor one on one defending around his own box. He has good pace going forward but lacks real quality deep in the final third.

STEVEN GERRARD

Now playing a deeper role and is England’s quarter back. Can open teams up and is very good switching the play and shows good discipline in the role, rarely leaving the middle of the pitch.

Shield: Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson can protect the back four in deep-lying midfielder roles

JORDAN HENDERSON

An energetic midfielder and a good athlete who has an eye for a goal, particularly around the edge of the box. He is a simple passer and links play well, but he is not a spectacular player.

DANNY WELBECK

A great athlete, particularly tracking opposition full backs and shows good energy. Always has a positive attitude on the ball whether through passing or running with it but lacks real technical skill.

WAYNE ROONEY

Will sit tight and play on Pirlo. Has lost a yard of pace but links play so well. He is one of England’s leaders and has the technical ability to score around the box. With the hot conditions I feel the whole game will be too much for him, so expect him to be replaced after 60 minutes for a lad called Barkley.

Leading the way: Daniel Sturridge can be extremely dangerous from outside the box

RAHEEM STERLING

Quick, tenacious and always positive in possession, he has the speed to break between the lines and do damage in the final third. He is all right foot but anything can happen with this kid. Beware.

DANIEL STURRIDGE

Can be magic, can be a match-winner and can be bang average. But around the box he’s always looking to try and get a shot in and needs to be watched carefully.

SUBSTITUTE       

Roy will make plenty of changes but the boy Barkley is the closest to Gazza I’ve seen. He’s got tricks, skills, top technical ability and is always looking to score or find an incisive pass to create a scoring opportunity. When this boy comes on something will happen.

Wing wizard: Raheem Sterling (left) offers pace and tenacity from the flanks

Back-up: Adam Lallana misses out on a place in the starting line-up against Italy

BROKEN DREAMS

Well, what did you expect? With just days to go and a lifetime’s dreams ahead, one bad tackle, one poor challenge or a bit of hard luck and you’re out of the World Cup.

Over the last 10 days we have seen Italy’s Riccardo Montolivo break his leg, Franck Ribery of France hurt his back and Germany’s Marco Reus injure his ankle.

Playing against Honduras, who are extremely physical with strong athletic, tough players, was a tricky encounter for the last warm-up game for the young lions.

But thankfully they came through and there was no way they were going to over exert themselves and put themselves in danger missing out.

Agony: Marco Reus is one of several talented stars set to miss the World Cup with injury

P.S.

As a very passionate Englishman who loves the flag of St George, is very proud of his country, who was stood in South Africa with the barmy army supporting our cricket team and as an England supporter watched the team in the World Cup in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth after doing the full length of South Africa’s famous Garden Route in a Fiat Panda in just one day to get there in time, I cannot and will never, ever pick anybody to beat my beloved England.

Forget Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar and the rest of them. For me it’s Rule Britannia. England to win it.

Believe: Forget the likes of Lionel Messi and Neymar, England can lift the 2014 World Cup trophy

My week...

On Tuesday I played in the Redgrave and Pinsent Celebrity Classic at the Sparks charity golf day at Harleyford Golf Club.

It’s a lovely spot just between Marlow and Henley-on-Thames down by the river. Both gentlemen are big enough and strong enough to look like Micky Droy, Chelsea’s famously tough centre back but they helped raise a great deal of money for the charity, which does vital research into children’s healthcare.

And once again Sparks put on a tremendous day. As the speeches at the end of the day were being made, Sir Matthew revealed that he’d brought along with him a little box that we might all want to look at.

Rewarding: Sir Steve Redgrave promised to bring his five gold medal to the next Celebrity Classic

Everyone was intrigued until he opened 
the box and inside were four small, saucer-sized Olympic gold medals.

He
 then, believe it or not, gave them to the first table of golfers and 
guests and they were nonchalantly passed around the room for us all to 
take pictures and touch the gold medals.

It was pretty magical from such
 a humble Olympic hero. Sir Steve congratulated everyone taking part and
 thanked Matthew for bringing his four gold medals.

He ended the day by 
saying next time he would have to bring his box with five in it.
