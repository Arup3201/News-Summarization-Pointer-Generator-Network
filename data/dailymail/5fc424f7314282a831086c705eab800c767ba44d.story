Star: Julie Goodyear, pictured at the 2005 National Television Awards, denies any knowledge of an Environment Agency probe

A farm owned by former Corrie actress Julie Goodyear is at the centre of an environmental probe over allegations that hazardous waste was dumped there illegally.

Land at the 69-year-old star's Primrose Hill Farm in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, has been filled in to raise the ground level as part of work to build riding stables.

But environment chiefs launched an investigation following allegations that the site was being filled in with illegal materials.

Miss Goodyear, who played legendary Rovers Return landlady Bet Lynch for more than 30 years, said she has no knowledge of the probe.

Work on the farm's horse arena was carried out by Roeacre Industries Ltd, of Heywood, after planning permission was granted by Rochdale town hall.

The Environment Agency is investigating whether materials were illegally dumped at the farm and, if so, what enforcement action should be taken.

Roeacre Industries company director Pete Cordwell said the allegations of illegal tipping were unfounded.

He said: 'Everything we've done there is perfectly legal. As far as we're concerned it wasn't waste - it was for engineering purposes. We've used granular fill, material like bricks and stones, to build the horse arena.'

Mr Cordwell added that no work had been carried out on the stables since last year.

Roeacre Industries ceased trading in 2010 and went into administration in January this year with debts of Â£350,000.

The Environment Agency said that, if a firm is in administration, it can still prosecute a company director if the business is found to have breached tipping regulations.

Construction and demolition waste can be considered hazardous under EU law especially if it contains dangerous substances such as asbestos or mercury.

Mark Fowles, environment officer at 
the Environment Agency, said: 'We are currently investigating a site at 
Primrose Hill Farm, Heywood, Lancashire, following allegations of waste 
being illegally tipped.

'Once
our investigation is complete we will consider what, if any, 
enforcement action is required to ensure we continue to protect the 
environment.'

Miss Goodyear bought Primrose Hill Farm around 15 years ago and has ploughed hundreds of thousands of pounds into its renovation.

It is now known whether she was living at the property when the alleged offences took place.

Her agent said the actress had no idea about the probe at the farm and did not wish to comment.

She recently attended the funeral of Weatherfield icon Betty Williams and is rumoured to be making a comeback to the street.

Roeacre Industries' administrators MCR declined to comment on the investigation.
