Louis van Gaal has praised his Manchester United side for their 'unbelievable' team spirit after they came from a goal down to beat Preston North End 3-1 in the FA Cup on Monday night.

The Red Devils will play Arsenal in the quarter-finals after seeing off the League One side at Deepdale, with goals from Ander Herrera, Marouane Fellaini and Wayne Rooney.

However, it took a Scott Laird opener for Preston for Van Gaal to change his system and see his team finally spark into life. The Dutchman claims that he was 'satisfied' before that moment, and delighted afterwards.

The Man United boss said the team spirit was 'unbelievable' in the comeback victory in the FA Cup fifth round

'Yes [the second half pleased me] but in the first half I was also reasonably satisfied,' Van Gaal told BBC One after the match. 'We didn’t give anything away, even though it’s difficult. 

'In the second half, the goal was unlucky. After then we showed the team spirit is unbelievable. 

We changed the shape, that was the solution I think. We scored fantastic goals, little bit lucky also. The second one for Fellaini – we have trained for that – I was pleased for Valencia.'

Van Gaal also praised Marouane Fellaini for his versatiliy, admitting that he doesn't always have a position for the Belgian. 

'He scores all sorts of goals. I played him for the first time in the position he wants. I don’t always have a position for him, that’s my problem.'

And when the 63-year-old was congratulated by the interviewer with a 'well played' at the end, he responded with: 'The spirit was better than well played!'
