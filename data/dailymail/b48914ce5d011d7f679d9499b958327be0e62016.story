Hot days will get hotter and overall rain totals will reduce, climate experts say about Australia's weather outlook over the next 100 years.

The projections released on Tuesday claim to be the most comprehensive ever produced, and are a joint effort by the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology.

'There is very high confidence that hot days will become more frequent and hotter,' CSIRO principal research scientist Kevin Hennessy said.

CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology predict days are set to become longer and hotter in the next 100 years due to climate change

Sea levels are also expected to rise and oceans are predicted to become more acidic

Australia's average annual rainfall is expected to decline, but extreme rain events will become more intense

'We also have very high confidence that sea levels will rise, oceans will become more acidic, and snow depths will decline.'

Australia's average annual rainfall is expected to decline, but extreme rain events are likely to become more intense, the report says.

Trends linked to climate change, such as less frequent but more intense tropical cyclones and harsher fire weather, are likely to kick in from about 2030.

The report says Australia's average surface air temperature has increased by 0.9C since 1910, and many heat-related records have been broken in recent years.

Sea level has risen about 20 centimetres in the past century.
