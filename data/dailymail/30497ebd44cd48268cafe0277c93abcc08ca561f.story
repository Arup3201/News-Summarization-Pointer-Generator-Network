West Ham team-mates Adrian and Mauro Zarate got together to mock Ricardo Vaz Te's dress sense with a hilarious Twitter post on Monday.

Following on from their 1-0 victory over fellow high-flyers Newcastle on Saturday, West Ham's players are clearly in a jovial mood as they prepare for Tuesday's trip to West Brom.

And Adrian was seen trying on a garish pink coat that belonged to attacker Vaz Te, with Mauro Zarate tweeting a picture with the caption 'with the horrible Vaz Te coat !!!!'

Mauro Zarate uploaded the picture via Twitter of West Ham goalkeeper Adrian posing with the pink coat

Judging by the picture, Adrian  did not rate Vaz Te's coat any better himself.

He pointed at it with an unimpressed face, implying he may have to give him some fashion tips himself.

And  Vaz Te will not be able to deny the coat belongs to him, as his name badge is visible in the background above his hanger.
