You could say that their love is set in stone. Or that their relationship is as solid as a rock.

Whichever way you pun it, it is unlikely to be a proposal that Kelly Aldridge, 30, from Tewkesbury, will ever forget.

Her boyfriend Oliver Wright, 31, secretly arranged rocks to spell out 'Kelly, will you marry me?' in a quarry at the foot of Leckhampton Hill near Cheltenham where the couple often go walking.

Saying it with stones: Oliver Wright and girlfriend Kelly with his novel proposal

The nervous chap then led his unsuspecting girlfriend on a trek up to the top of the hill to a point where she could look down and read the romantic proposal. 

'I was completely overwhelmed,' said Kelly, 30. 'We were walking along holding hands and it was a beautiful sunny morning then Oliver suddenly stopped.

'I looked at him, then looked down the cliff and that's when I saw it. I just froze, I couldn't believe it.'

The personal assistant from Tewkesbury said she had no hesitation in accepting the proposal.

'Then I said "yes, yes, yes" and he went down on one knee and got the ring out.'

Oliver Wright proposed to his girlfriend Kelly Aldridge by spelling out the question with rocks

The pair then savoured the moment over a glass of bubbly. 

She added: 'We went down to the bottom of the hill and Oliver pulled out a bottle of champagne from behind a rock and poured two glasses.

'We sat there and celebrated with a glass of champagne despite it only being 11 o'clock in the morning. Walkers at the top of the hill shouted down their congratulations to us. It was a really special moment and one I will remember for the rest of my life.'

The couple have been seeing each other for nearly a year since they met via a dating website.

It took five hours for Oliver to set out the stones at the bottom of Leckhampton Hill near Cheltenham

Oliver, who works as a chef at upmarket Willoughby House Hotel in Cheltenham, said he knew Kelly was the girl for him at their very first meeting.

And, he admitted, he had been planning the romantic rock proposal since securing Kelly's father's permission over Christmas.

'I have always loved going to Leckhampton Hill, and I have seen people write things with rocks there before, so I thought why not?' he told the Gloucestershire Echo.

'It is our favourite place to go, and it's also where we went on our first walk together as a couple.

'I went up to arrange the rocks the week before. It took me about five hours but I wanted to get it just right.

Kelly didn't think twice about saying yes. The happy couple are now planning their wedding

'Then every day during the week I went to check on them to make sure they were still there. It was a lovely sunny morning and we virtually had the hill to ourselves when we reached the top. I'm just glad she said yes.'

The couple plan to move in together in Cheltenham and want to wed later this year or early in 2015. 

Now it seems that Oliver's actions may have helped another couple decide to take the plunge. When the newly-engaged pair went back to the site days later the rocks had been changed to 'Carla, will you marry me?'

If she finds out that the proposal was meant for another, Carla's boyfriend might be in for rather a rocky time...
