Sam Allardyce has expressed his disappointment after his West Ham side were handed yet another  FA Cup away tie - this time against fellow Premier League opposition West Brom.

The Hammers boss was frustrated with the outcome of the fifth round draw, after the east London side were handed a third successive tie away from home.

Allardyce's side have already seen off Everton and most recently Bristol City in the competition, but despite that the 60-year-old was hoping for a home draw this time around.

He told West Ham's official website: 'It is sad we have been drawn away from home again but we have won away in the previous two rounds and will have to try and do it the hard way. 

'As time goes by you realise how difficult it is. There are times when it gets close and goes away again. In this competition, you need a bit of luck.

'Whether it be the draw going through the rounds, it can be a refereeing decision, it could be a lucky bounce, or an own goal. Those sort of things need to go in your favour.'

After seeing the likes of Manchester City and Chelsea crash out of competition in the fourth round, Allardyce is dreaming of taking his side to Wembley and lifting the prestigious trophy. 

He added: 'It is every player and every manager's dream to win the FA Cup.

'The players are going to need to be at their best in the FA Cup, if you have an off day it is over. It would be fantastic for me to walk out at Wembley. 

'To take your team there is the reason you do this job.'
