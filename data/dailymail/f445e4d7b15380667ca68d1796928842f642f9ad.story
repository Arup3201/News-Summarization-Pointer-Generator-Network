An elderly couple who couldn't face life apart died within hours of each other in a 'real-life love story' that resembled the plot of hit Hollywood film The Notebook.

Billy Grimes, 80 and his wife Dolly, 79, had been married for 60 years before they were admitted to Fazakerley Hospital in Merseyside, where they both died on March 15.

Family members have compared the couple's deaths to the 2004 film The Notebook, where an elderly man played by James Garner dies peacefully in bed along with his dementia-suffering childhood sweetheart.

History: Billy and Dolly's daughter Dolly Maxwell holds a picture of her parents taken on their 1955 wedding day

Mr Grimes was admitted to Fazakerley Hospital three weeks before his death after suffering a heart attack and kidney failure at the end of February.

Mrs Grimes was taken ill just one day before she died, with doctors giving her only 24 hours to live.

Caring medical staff moved Mrs Grimes 
to her husband’s ward in the early hours of March 15 - with Mr Grimes hanging on long enough to spend a few minutes with his wife before passing away.

Mrs Grimes died just a few hours later.

Billy and Dolly Grimes' romantic deaths have been compared to the The Notebook - the hit 2004 film starring Ryan Gosling.

In the film, an elderly man, 'Duke' (played by James Garner), is seen reading a story to a dementia-suffering woman, Allie (played by Gena Rowlands).

The story he reads tells the story of a young man, Noah Calhoun (played by Ryan Gosling), and a 17-year-old heiress (played by Rachel McAdams) during the Second World War.

After a summer romance, the couple split when Noah goes off to war and the heiress reluctantly gets married.

Later in the film in becomes clear that 'Duke' is in fact Noah, and Allie is the heiress and the story is taken from notes Allie made about her love for Noah after being told of her dementia.

In the present day 'Duke' suffers a heart attack and is taken to the same care home as Allie. As the film ends, Duke comforts Allie - who is worrying about her deteriorating memory.

The couple are then seen lying next to each other in bed, with nurses finding them both peacefully passed away the next day.

The film had mixed reviews upon its release, but has since gained a cult following - winning eight Teen Choice Awards, a Satellite Award and a MTV Movie Award.

The couple's daughter Dolly Maxwell, 57, said she believed the couple couldn’t bear to be parted and described their deaths as a 'real-life love story'.

'What happened in the hospital was just so surreal, you couldn’t make it up,' she added.

'We knew dad was dying but he hung on to see mum one last time. And as soon as she came around the corner he died, it was like he was holding on for her.'

'I don’t think either one would have been able to cope without the other. It is so sad but I take great comfort in knowing that they are still together.'

'Everybody keeps saying how surreal it is that they died on the same day. It is a real life love story.'

Mr and Mrs Grimes grew up together in Liverpool as children, but it wasn’t until Mr Grimes returned as a teenager after being evacuated during in the Second World War that they started a relationship.

Marrying in 1955 at the age of 20, the couple would have celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary next year.

The couple had eight children in eight years - but infant son Frank died from meningitis at the age of 11 months ,and they also lost their son Barry at the age of 49.

Speaking of her parents' deaths, Mrs Maxwell said: 'The hospital staff were amazing, moving mum so early in the morning just so they could be together.'

'My dad had been in hospital for three weeks. They couldn’t do anything for him, then mum got taken in with pains,' she added.

'We knew that dad was dying and they brought my mum up to the same ward, the doctors said she only had 24 hours to live, ' she went on to say.

Mrs Maxwell added that two of her brothers were travelling back from Canterbury to visit their parents on the day, and said it was as if Mrs Grimes was hanging on for them before she also passed away.

'She was very family oriented and was always supportive. My dad was a real man’s man,' she said.

'In a way it’s a comfort that they’ve gone together, although we didn’t expect my mum to go... One couldn’t have lived without the other,' Mrs Maxwell added.

The family are holding a joint funeral for Mr and Mrs Grimes on Wednesday.
