A powerful earthquake struck today near Japan's crippled Fukushima power plant - triggering a small tsunami.

The 6.8-magnitude quake hit six miles below the sea surface off the coast of Fukushima in northern Japan at 4.22am (7.22pm Friday GMT).

The force injured a 68-year-old woman who reportedly fell down the stairs and broke her leg, as well as shaking buildings in Tokyo, around 120 miles away.

It also sparked a small tsunami, which reached the coast of Ishinomaki Ayukawa and Ofunato about 50 minutes after the quake.

Smaller waves were observed at several other locations along the coast, but changes to the shoreline were not visible on television footage aired by public broadcaster NHK.

Eight towns which were devastated by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami issued evacuation advisories to thousands of households along the coast, along with schools and community centres.

These included Rikuzentakata, Higashi Matsushima and Otsuchi.

All tsunami and evacuation advisories were lifted about two hours after the quake.

Tokyo Electric Power Company, which 
operates Fukushima Dai-ichi, instructed plant workers along the coast to
 retreat to higher ground.

But today, the plant - which was decimated in the 2011 disaster - and two other nuclear power plants, along with other nuclear facilities along the coast, found no abnormalities.

Their reactors and fuel storage pools are currently being cooled safely, according to the Nuclear Regulation Authority.

The 2011 disaster killed about 19,000 people and triggered multiple meltdowns at the Fukushima plant.

More than 100,000 people are still unable to go home due to fear of radiation contamination.
