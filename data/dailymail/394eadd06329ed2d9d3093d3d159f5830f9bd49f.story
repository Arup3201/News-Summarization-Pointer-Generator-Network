While Olympic gold medalist Grant Hackett has admitted to an addiction to Stilnox, no one has detailed the effects of his addiction as vividly as flight attendant Owen Beddall in his new tell-all memoir: Confessions of a Qantas Flight Attendant: True Tales and Gossip From The Galley.

Mr Beddall spent 12 years attending to the needs and whims of the rich and famous as a first class Qantas flight attendant. His book documents finding comedian Russell Brand and singer Katy Perry delightful as they returned from their 'first date' in Phuket as 'celebrities do'.  He said Katy was so down to earth she could have been any other passenger.

Then there was the flight where he plied stunning British singer Lily Allen with so much booze she was 's***faced', which was 'the absolute proof I'm 100 per cent gay. If I was a straight guy I would have taken advantage of her there and then.'

But it is Beddall's tale of watching Grant Hackett and his now ex-wife Candice Alley on a flight to London that is one of the most compelling.

Grant Hackett and his manager have both been contacted seeking comment to this story. In this extract from the book, Beddall recalls the flight at the end of 2005.

The book tells a revealing story of Grant Hackett high on sleeping pills on a flight with ex-wife Candice Alley back in 2005, when he had to be wrestled to the bathroom by crew

'OLYMPIC HERO LOSES IT

It was 11 pm in Bangkok and the passengers connecting with the flight to London started piling onto the plane. It was one of the rare occasions that I was rostered on with both my two close friends, Malcolm and Marcus – they were working in business and I was working in first class. We’d just come off a riotous thirty-six hours in Bangkok and I was feeling like death warmed up. Between the heat of Bangkok and the whingeing of the boarding passengers, I wished I could click my heels and be back in Brussels.

Everything was running as it usually did in first – champagne corks popping, canapés flowing and passengers complaining before they even had their seatbelt buckled! As we settled the precious ones into their seats, there was a buzz from business class. Australia’s Olympic swimming hero, Grant Hackett, and his singer girlfriend, Candice Alley – soon to be wife; now ex-wife – were seated in 25J and 25K. There was general excitement from crew and passengers alike.

After the first- and business-class passengers were all put to bed, crew grabbed the cheese boards and gathered in the business-class galley on the main deck for our customary goss. The light over 25J went on and it was Candice. Grant was asleep.

Beddall's book also tells of the time he met Russell Brand (left) and Katy Perry (right) on their return flight from their 'first date' in Phuket

She handed us a packet of the sleeping sedative, Stilnox, and asked us to please hide it, explaining that they reacted badly with him; he’d just taken some. Thus instructed, we did as she asked. About two hours later, I was standing alone in the first-class galley flipping through a magazine when, smack bang, Grant Hackett came flying out of business class and through the first-class curtain followed closely by Malcolm and Marcus, who were desperately trying to restrain him.

'I should be in here,' he slurred. He then stepped towards the front right door and started to unzip his fly. Eventually, we wrestled him into the toilet; let’s just say it was like getting a thoroughbred horse into a racing barrier. Although I’d heard that some people had bad reactions to Stilnox – even sleepwalking – this was truly bizarre behaviour.

Grant Hackett is slightly shy of two metres tall. Somehow, when he emerged, we managed to steer him back to his seat; that was a lengthy struggle. Minutes later, he was amorously kissing Candice. While we found that amusing, Candice was clearly embarrassed. We were trying to assess what she wanted us to do when his behaviour suddenly became a great deal more intimate. Quick as a flash, we removed her from the situation by taking her to the business-class refreshment bar then I raced to get Grant some water.

Former Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett had to be wrestled to the toilets and his ex-wife handed his pills over to flight attendants so he couldn't take any more, according to Beddall

When I returned with the water, he was laughing to himself while hop-scotching over Candice’s reclined seat. Everyone around him was shocked; our Olympic hero off his head on sleeping pills? Of course, years later, his battle with sleeping pill addiction would become public. Fortunately he settled, and during the breakfast service in the morning he appeared quite sheepish.

Before they disembarked, I quietly slipped Candice the Stilnox as she exited the toilet and she thanked me. Back in business class, Grant was looking under his seat and shaking out his blanket.

When I enquired whether everything was all right, he told me rather abruptly that he was looking for something.

Marcus travelled in to central London on the same Heathrow Express train as the celebrity couple and reported that Grant still looked upset about losing ‘something’.

He must have got over it because Malcolm, who was working on Grant’s return flight to Australia, told me it was uneventful.'
