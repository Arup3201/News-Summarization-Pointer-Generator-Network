Kevin Doyle is following Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard to America after signing for MLS side Colorado Rapids.

Doyle – who is currently at Championship Wolves – has signed a two-and-a-half year deal with the Rapids starting on July 1.

The Ireland striker, 31, says he was convinced to move across the Atlantic after speaking to international team-mate Robbie Keane, who is at LA Galaxy.

But before Doyle’s American adventure begins he says his aim is to try and get Wolves back into the Premier League.

Wolves beat Derby 2-0 on Friday night and are only outside the top six on goal difference.

Doyle said: ‘I am delighted and very excited to be moving to the Colorado Rapids.

‘With so many great players moving to MLS to join up with the great American talent already there, it's a great time to play in this league.

‘I know from talking to Robbie Keane that MLS is a great league to play in and I look forward to being another top Irish player there.

‘I will be sad to leave Wolves, a truly great club that I've had the privilege to play for. I will always be grateful to the fans for their support; it is they who make Molineux such a special place.

‘To be involved in the current squad that is on an exciting run is now my only focus, as it would mean so much to me to see us get back to the Premier League.’

Doyle becomes the latest player to swap the Premier League for MLS with Gerrard and Lampard moving to LA Galaxy and New York City FC and Shaun Maloney who joined Chicago Fire in January.
