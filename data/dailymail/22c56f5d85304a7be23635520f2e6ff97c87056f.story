Jordan Flynn, 19, died suddenly from a rare inflammation of the heart, after visiting the GP and being told he was suffering from a virus

A 19-year-old PE student died suddenly from a suspected heart infection - just days after doctors told him to take paracetamol.

First-year university student Jordan Flynn was told by a GP that he had a virus and needed to rest and take painkillers to ease his symptoms.

But days later he died with his mother at his side in intensive care - just a week after his 19th birthday.

His sudden and unexpected death has shocked his peers at the University of Brighton's campus in Eastbourne, East Sussex, where they held a vigil on Monday night.

His heartbroken mother, Angie Flynn, of Birmingham, said: 'He had been ill for a couple of days and he was talking to me on the phone telling me he had low energy, fatigue and was unable to move.

'He also kept passing out so I was worried because his uni friends had all gone home and he was on his own there.'

She convinced him to see the GP but she claims they turned her son away believing it was a viral infection.

But when he didn't recover, Mrs Flynn told her son to call NHS 111 for advice.

The service called for paramedics and Mr Flynn was taken to Eastbourne District General Hospital's coronary unity.

She said: 'I sat with him the entire time and he was very, very breathless and very, very restless.'

Mr Flynn, originally from Wales, was then taken to be treated by heart specialists at Harefield Hospital, in Hillingdon, north west London, where he died on February 3.

He died from previously undiagnosed myocarditis – inflammation of the heart – and suffered a cardiac arrest, the Brighton Argus reports. 

The rare condition which causes inflammation and is often triggered by a virus, damages the heart muscle or the fibres that conduct electrical pulses to the heart, causing complications.

There are no specific causes of the condition but it is usually triggered by a virus.

Mrs Flynn said she wishes he had been admitted to hospital earlier and transferred to the specialist unit while he still had some strength.

Paying tribute to her son she told Argus journalists: 'I was trying to think how I would describe my handsome smiling son Jordan, but really no words could do justice to his strength, determination, logic, humour and his beautiful soul.

'He was someone I always aspired to be.

Mr Flynn was a first year student at the University of Brighton. Students at the university set off sky lanterns to mark Jordan's passing, and will hold a memorial service this week

She added: 'Jordan truly appreciated each day and the simplest things in life made him happy, like pranks, granola, football, his PlayStation and his bed.

'How he lived showed us that success is measured in how you live and not in what you have or do. His ordinary was our extraordinary, his beauty was in not knowing how truly amazing he was.'

University of Brighton students set off sky lanterns to mark Mr Flynn's passing, and will hold a memorial service this week.

His friend Andy Matthews tweeted: 'RIP Jordan Flynn, sad news and a massive shock. Loved playing football with you and winding you up. You will be missed by a lot of people.'

Another friend, Sam Dayaman, tweeted: 'RIP Jordan Flynn , was a pleasure playing football with you and spending time together in our college classes. Sleep tight mate x'

His post mortem examination is due to be held this week.

Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle. There are no specific causes of the condition but it is usually triggered by a virus.

Some of the most common infections which cause myocarditis, are those called adenovirus and Coxsackie B.

Others include:

Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle, often caused by a virus

Symptoms of the condition, include:

If the inflammation damages the heart muscle or the fibres that conduct electrical pulses to the heart, complications can develop.

They can develop quickly, and include sudden loss of consciousness, an abnormally fast, slow or irregular heartbeat, and heart failure.

In most cases of viral myocarditis, the illness goes away and there are no complications.

In some cases the inflammation and damage is so severe the only treatment option is a heart transplant.

In very severe cases the condition is fatal. Also, some cases of sudden death in a previously healthy person are due to an acute myocarditis that develops rapidly.
