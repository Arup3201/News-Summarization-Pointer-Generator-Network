John Watson competed in 152 Formula One races over 10 years. He won five times, including the 1981 British Grand Prix for McLaren, and scored 169 career points. After leaving the sport in 1985, Watson has forged a successful media career, and today he writes for MailOnline.

Ahead of the new season, which starts in Melbourne this weekend, Watson gives his verdict on who he thinks will win the title, Red Bull's reliability woes, and why his former team McLaren must finish in the top three this year.

I have to say Mercedes. They are the best prepared in terms of every element and they are quick. You are going to see a whole raft of development going on and they have got the budget to be able to do that. They have the money, the talent and the equipment.

On the one hand you have got Lewis Hamilton who is very exciting, and on the other, you have Nico Rosberg who drives more with his head. The fuel will be a factor so how you use, as to abuse your tyres, will be key, so I think Rosberg has the advantage on that level, and he probably shades it. For raw speed Lewis might have him.

In the spotlight: Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will start as the favourites to win this year's F1 title

It comes down to the pace of development. Red Bull have got a fantastic car, but it suffers through overheating and their new engine parts. The way that it is packaged is, in part Renault's responsibility, but also the way Red Bull go about their engineering - they take it to the absolute limit. They are on the outside edge of that limit and as a consequence they will suffer from reliability problems. But they have got the capacity, in terms of people and budget, to turn it around very quickly.

I would not be surprised if we see Red Bull returning to the front of the grid. They will be winning a race or more before mid-season, but whether they can recover and dominate as they did at the end of last year will be a very difficult challenge for them at this stage.

All smiles: But Sebastian Vettel will face an uphill challenge to defend his Formula One title this term

Under fire: But John Watson expects Red Bull to win at least one race before mid-season

Christian loves talking. He has become a media babe and he loves the camera and the microphone. Even when the team is struggling he is still there talking away. I would hate to think he is becoming the story,instead of the messenger...

The difference is when reliability was an issue we did not have the global TV coverage that we do today. I don't want to see a grand prix where potentially a number of cars will fail to qualify and will be outside the 107 per cent rule. I don't want drivers either with a car which are incapable of running 20 laps before they retire, and even that may be optimistic.

All this is a consequence of these very radical changes in regulations. Maybe the people who made the new rules should have looked at it from a reliability perspective and not gone quite so radical as they have done.

There are three fully-funded teams on the grid – Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes. Everybody else is funded by degrees, and some teams are still probably paying off the bills from 2012 let alone 2013, so they will take longer to get over the reliability problems. You will then see the top three teams dominating.  McLaren will be amongst them, but it is a question of how competitive they are going to be. Some teams may run slower than a GP2 car and that would be a travesty.

Felipe Massa seems to have found himself in a really good place. Williams have a competitive car. They have got the right engine and for a driver like Felipe who has been somewhat subjugated with Michael Schumacher and then Fernando Alonso. He is now at a team where he can be Felipe Massa.

Contender: Felipe Massa may spring a surprise for Williams this season following his move from Ferrari

The team are impressed with him and I am sure he will be delighted that the car is competitive. It does depend whether Williams can sustain it over the season and mix it with the top teams.

I would also like to see Kevin Magnussen do to Jenson Button what Alain Prost did to me in 1980 – a young guy coming in and doing an outstanding job, taking on and maybe getting the better of his more established partner.

Dream team? Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso

They are both great drivers and great world champions, and they are both diametrically opposed in terms of personality. My only concern about Raikkonen coming back is that Alonso is such a good operator of every element so Raikkonen will have to do a lot more than he was doing at Lotus where in reality his then team-mate Romain Grosjean, was not challenging him.

I would have thought that Alonso will be the dominant of the two drivers, but I cannot underestimate Kimi. I did underestimate him when he came back at Lotus, but the way he drives a racing car is a pleasure to watch, but he can't let the Ferrari garage be solely on Alonso's side. 

The
 principle change at McLaren is Ron Dennis returning in a controlling 
situation and part of the reason I am in Melbourne is to see a team I 
was a member of reformed. In effect we now have a McLaren team that is 
in the same state as it was 32 years ago. I want to see what that team 
will do under Ron's leadership.

But the problem McLaren have, is that it is like an ocean liner – it is massive. It has its own momentum and it takes time to get that under control and to turn it. It can't be changed by one individual coming in, but what that individual will do is set into motion a whole new process, thinking, commitment and motivation.

Happy days: Jenson Button shares a joke with former team-mate Hamilton in the Melbourne paddock

Ron needs to ensure his team finish in the top three this year. He has to beat one of Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes and that is not going to be an easy task, but he has the advantage of that Mercedes engine. Jenson Button is a thinking racing driver and he knows how to win a race. When it comes to conserving fuel and tyres, Jenson has got that capacity and can win grands prix. He needs to make good use of the car in qualifying.

I won my first grand prix in Austria at the circuit which was known then as the Osterreichring. Now it is called the Red Bull Ring and it is a shadow of its former magnificent self. There are a number of great tracks, but to me Monza IS Formula One. It always has been and it always will be. I went to Austin for the inaugural United States Grand Prix and that was fantastic. It is a wonderful circuit and a fantastic venue, but from a pure spectacle perspective Singapore wins hands down.

I have no feeling for it one way or the other. It wouldn't have changed anything in 2013, and would not have changed an awful lot in 2012. If it is going to attract a bigger audience and reinvigorate the end of the season than I am happy.

I think there is more chance that we'll get struck by lightning than it going down to the final race. In other words, no, it will be tied up before we get to Brazil. It will be a Mercedes-engine car which will win. We could have Massa as world champion but the most likely scenario is that it will be either Rosberg or Hamilton.
