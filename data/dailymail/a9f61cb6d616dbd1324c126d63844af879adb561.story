Champion cyclist Bradley Wiggins has given Simon Cowell the brush-off after reports X-Factor bosses are sounding out Britain's Olympics stars to appear on the show.

The gold medallist and Tour de France winner said the popular talent show could not compare toÂ  London 2012 in terms of gripping the nation.

'Let's not talk about the X-Factor,' he said. 'Compared to the Olympics, everywhere you 
went the country was on a high, and as athletes it was phenomenal to see
that, then you see X-Factor and it's like, "Oh God, everyone's got to 
put up with that all winter now".'

Wigged out: Cycling hero Bradley has said he has no interest in appearing on Simon Cowell's X-Factor

His dismissal comes after insiders revealed that 
the programme-makers are hoping to persuade the heroes of Team GB to be
guest mentors at the first live show.

Contestants will be performing songs 
with a sporting or winning theme such as Spandau Ballet's Gold, 
Survivor's Eye Of The Tiger and David Bowie's Heroes.

Unlike Wiggins, heptathlon golden girl Jessica Ennis was intrigued by the idea.

She told ITV's Lorraine yesterday: 'This is definitely news to me but it sounds like a brilliant idea. I'm a massive fan of X-Factor so we'll see.'

Asked whether she would appear, she said: 'Well yes, definitely, I think it's a great idea, yes.

'Before the Olympics I was just training so hard and making sure that I 
didn't miss anything so I had to turn a lot of things down and say no to
things that I would loved to have done at the time.

'Now I can just relax now that I've got this medal and I can enjoy myself a bit.'

Wiggins's fellow cyclist and six-time gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy said he had not been approached either.

He tweeted yesterday: 'Some amusing stories in press about me being a mentor on X-Factor. That's the first I've heard about it! #dontbelievethehype'.

He then added: 'And no I'm not doing Strictly either!!'

The BBC's Strictly Come Dancing has benefitted from appearances by sporting legends including hurdler Colin Jackson and Welsh 
boxing great Joe Calzaghe.

The idea is said to be for the athletes to give pep 
talks to contestants in the week leading up to the first live show, and then attend the heat.

Double gold winner Mo Farah is also said to have been approached over a role, with X-Factor suffering a ratings hit on its launch.

The first episode, aired on Saturday night, was down two million viewers on last year.

PR guru Max Clifford, who represented Hoy four years ago after the Beijing Olympics, said he is to cycling 'what Simon Cowell is to TV music talent'.
