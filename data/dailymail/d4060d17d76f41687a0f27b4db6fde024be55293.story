She is the grande dame of the catwalk with more pedigree than the rest of the London Fashion Week designers put together.

And last night, Vivienne Westwood celebrated yet another successful runway show with a packed-to-the-rafters party at Embassy Brasserie.

The maverick British designer invited a circle of friends and industry pals to a dinner at the Mayfair restaurant - the second year running she has chosen Embassy for her after-show party... they must be doing something right.

A flock of colourful creatures flooded W1 dressed in their finest, filling the restaurant until they spilled out onto the terrace.

Westwood, whose Red Label catwalk show was held at the Government's Foreign Office earlier that day, arrived on the arm of husband Andreas Kronthaler after sitting front row at Philip Treacy's comeback show at the Royal Courts of Justice.

But for all her success as a designer, and for all the fashionistas, bloggers, stylists and journalists queuing up to get a bit of Westwood wisdom, Westwood, who looked as striking as ever in a dress of her own design, says now she cares little for fashion, using it only as a platform to promote her environmental work.

At her show finale she took to the runway in a pair of hot pants and a T-shirt bearing the words Climate Revolution, a moustache and monacle inked on her face with a marker pen, telling her guests to 'Buy less, choose well, make it last.' Wise words.

At the party, Vivienne's Climate Change warriors roamed the room in bright green costumes, collecting money for her charity.

Guests were left in the expert hands of the restaurant's new star chef, the irrepressible Benoit Marmoiton (how does he keep smiling while serving up 100 covers at once?), who brought out delicate scallop ceviche, burrata with heirloom tomatoes or beef carpaccio, followed by roast cod served with Mediterranean vegetables in Le Creuset pots or slow-cooked beef with roasted new potatoes.

It's all about the glamour: Olivia Grant gorgeous in sequins, Laura Whitmore cool in hot pants and Tolula Adeyemi wearing the stunning parrot print scarf dress by Charlotte Taylor with necklace by Denise Manning

Pudding - yes, fashionistas do eat pud - was chocolate mousse with a hazelnut twist, strawberry tart or creme brulée.

The soundtrack to the meal was Vivaldi - a personal request from Vivienne, who adores classical music - and the atmosphere in the buzzy restaurant, fuelled by a cool crowd (Nellee Hooper, Tallulah Adeyemi, Olivia 
Grant, Lady Victoria Hervey and Laura Whitmore joined in the fun before joining the party downstairs) plus heady CIROC vodka cocktails and excited chatter was such that it was past midnight when guests poured through the doors down the red-lit staircase to nightclub Salon for a riotous party that went on till the wee hours. 

DJ Erol Sabadosh presided over a packed dancefloor... here are his top three tracks of the night:

Actress Olivia Grant, dressed in oh-so-glam sequins, said she hadn't made it to enough fashion week shows thanks to her filming schedule for new TV show Endeavour - but that she planned to make up for it tonight. 'I  have to be up at 7.30am for work, but I think I may pull an all-nighter in honour of fashion week,' she said.

Presenter Laura Whitmore, who'd been busy filming for MTV during London Fashion Week, said she was looking forward to Pam Hogg's show tomorrow, more so because she was the name behind Mary Charteris' wedding dress.

Co-owner and operator Dan Kapp said it was a 'total pleasure' to host the Vivienne Westwood dinner for a second season at Embassy Brasserie. 'We love that we share Dame Vivienne's passion for supporting young, interesting talent and artists at Salon too,' he said.

The atmosphere was electric, the vibe addictive - to the point that at 3am when sensible London Fashion Week goers should be tucked up in face masks preparing for the next day's early start, they were getting their rocks off to DJ Erol Sabadosh's set, playing table football or posing for photos with the club's giant white gorilla statue - which is set to be auctioned off for one of Westwood's favoured charities Cool Earth later this month (say your goodbyes now).

A fitting end to a fabulous day for fashion's favourite Dame.
