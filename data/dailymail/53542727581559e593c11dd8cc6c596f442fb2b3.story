Syrian troops advanced through the central city of Hama in a fresh crackdown a day after government forces killed 24 people.

Machine gun fire rang out through the city as a fresh onslaught against protesters was launched a day after the bloody fighting.

The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said most of Monday's 24 deaths were in Hama, which has been the target of a heavy military operation since Sunday.

The current crackdown appears aimed at preventing protests from swelling, with today being the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, activists said.

Muslims converge on mosques for the special nightly prayers after breaking their dawn-to-dusk fast and activists said that the gatherings could then turn into large protests throughout the country.

Around 1,700 civilians have been killed since the largely peaceful protests against President Bashar Assad's regime began in mid-March, according to estimates.

The regime disputes the toll and blames a foreign conspiracy for the unrest, saying religious extremists - not true reform-seekers - are behind it.

Hama-based activist Omar Hamawi said that troops advanced around 700 yards from the western entrance of the city overnight, taking up positions near homes and buildings in an area known as Kazo Square.

He said the force consisted of eight tanks and several armored personnel carriers.

Hamawi added that troops were also reinforced on the eastern side of the city around the Hama Central Prison, an overcrowded jail.

He said that residents there saw smoke billowing from the prison overnight and heard sporadic gunfire from inside the premises, leading some to believe that the inmates were rioting.

He added that it was impossible to know what was exactly going on in the prison or whether there were casualties inside the tightly controlled facility.

The activist also said that parts of Hama were this morning hit withÂ  heavy machine gun fire after sporadic shelling overnight.

He said a shell hit a compound known as the Palace of Justice in the city centre, causing a huge fire that burned much of the building, that is home to several courts.

The Syrian Observatory said that Monday's death toll included 10 people in Hama, six in the Damascus suburb of Arbeen and three in the central province of Homs.

Two were killed in the eastern town of al-Boukamal, two the coastal city of Latakia and one in Maadamiyah near Damascus, the group said.

Hama has a history of being opposed to the Assad family's 40-year dynasty in Syria.

In 1982, President Assad's father, Hafez Assad, ordered the military to quell a rebellion by Syrian members of the conservative Muslim Brotherhood movement.

The city was sealed off and bombs dropped from above smashed swathes of the city and killed between 10,000 and 25,000 people, rights groups say.

The real number may never be known as foreign officials were not allowed to reach the area.
