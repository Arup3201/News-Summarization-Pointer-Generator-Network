The same year Sydney Siege gunman Man Monis was dropped from national watch lists, it’s been revealed he was also reported to AFP for repeatedly threatening an Islamic school principal.

As more information comes to light about Monis’ violent and disturbing past, people continue to question why the man with a history of threatening behaviour was not being more closely monitored by authorities.

It’s alleged that Man Monis repeatedly made threats to the principal of a South Sydney school, accusing him of being a traitor and a ‘sell-out’ for allowing the school to engage in interfaith activities, according to SMH.

Man Monis - under the name Mohammed Hassan Manteghi - (pictured protesting outside the Downing Centre's local court in November 2009) convinced Amnesty International that was an Iranian spy in 2007

After sending about twelve abusive faxes, ranting about the school’s choice to associate with a Jewish school and for holding an interfaith Anzac Day ceremony, Man Monis’ messages became more sinister.

'People like you will get what's coming your way,’ he wrote to Osman Karolia, who was then the principal of Arkana College in Kingsgrove.

Mr Karolia became concerned and asked if that was intended as a threat, to which Monis replied ‘yes’.

Mr Karolia contacted Australian Federal Police, deeply concerned that Man Monis was acting in a hostile manner towards himself and the school.

Although Monis was investigated, police still elected to stop monitoring Monis by removing him from watch lists that same year.

The self-made Sheik went on to commit a string of awful crimes before he shocked the world on December 15 with the hostage crisis. 

In 2013, he was charged with being an accessory in the murder of his ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal. He has was also charged with multiple counts of sexual assault and was charged for sending abusive emails to the family of dead Australian soldiers in 2011.

The lawyer who defended him in the case, Nazir Daawar, has also come forward, alleging that the criminal had high-level connections with Iran’s intelligence services.

Mr Daawar reveals that Monis had been the director of a travel agency, which has a series of significant implications, according to The Australian.

Amnesty wrote a letter supporting Monis' refugee application after reviewing Iranian anti-regime poetry he had published

In the Iranian community, a travel agent is a hugely important role as they have the power to obtain visas, meaning they have the ability to decide who can enter or exit Iran.

By having this authoritative position, Daawar alleges that it can be assumed that Monis had an intimate understanding of the inner workings of the Iranian intelligence services.

Amnesty International have also made an admission that they wrote a letter to the Australian Government in support of crazed Sydney siege gunman Man Monis seeking asylum after the conman was successfully convincing in his perception of an Iranian spy.

Monis approached the human rights body in April 1997, under the name Mohammed Hassan Manteghi, claiming that his life was in danger after writing poetry published by an Iranian anti-regime outlet.

Amnesty wrote a letter of consideration to the Immigration Department to be taken into account in their determination of the Iranian national's refugee application before his visa was granted in 2001.

'Mohamed Hassan Manteghi’s status as a cleric, his involvement with the Ministry of Intelligence, and his connections with high level individuals are relevant considerations which add objective weight to his fear of persecution, and to his fear of being targeted by the authorities outside Iran,' The Daily Telegraph reported the supposed letter from Amnesty International stated.

Amnesty refugee coordinator Dr Graham Thom highlighted the political nature of Mr Manteghi's poetry published in Iran, after reviewing copies of the work printed in the Payam-e Daneshju publication.

'As detailed in this letter, we confirmed that the Iranian authorities had arrested the publisher of this poetry in July 1996 for "publishing lies and causing public confusion",' he said. 

'The editor of this publication continues to be in and out of jail in Iran for his writing.'  

However, Dr Thom conceded if he had been the coordinator at the time then he would have been written the letter differently.

'Amnesty's processes have certainly changed … today when I get evidence we will only state something as a fact when we're able to verify it,' The Daily Telegraph reported.

'I'm not sure why (Monis's claims) were taken at face value.'  

He said Monis gave names that matched those of Iranian officials which was presented as evidence to the Australian government.

Terrorism expert Greg Barton said part of the issue was that Monis was a 'brilliant individual' who was 'very manipulative'.

'He was a good con artist - certainly not a regular person,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

He also praised Amnesty for the handling of the costly blunder.

'It's easy to be critical - kudos to them for admitting to making a mistake.' 

Monis approached Amnesty International for a second time in August 2010 under the guise of Sheikh Haron.

He visited the Sydney office without notice and requested support.

'Amnesty International declined to provide him with assistance, as his case did not meet the organisation's human rights criteria,' Dr Thom said. 

'After declining this request for support, Amnesty International had no further involvement in his case and advised him to contact police.'
