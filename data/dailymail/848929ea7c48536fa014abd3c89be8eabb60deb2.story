Hull boss Steve Bruce has vowed to relish every moment of Saturday's FA Cup final against Arsenal after being hit with another timely reminder of the precarious nature of football management.

Bruce believes the prospects for Premier League managers are now bleaker than anywhere else in the world after Tim Sherwood became the second top-flight manager to lose his job this week.

Bruce expressed his surprise over Sherwood's departure which came shortly after Pepe Mel's exit from West Bromwich Albion on Monday night.

Bruce said: 'I never thought I'd see the day but it's now becoming like it is in Europe or South America - in fact it's probably worse now.

'We keep getting told the average lifespan (for a manager) is 13 months and another good young manager has just lost his job.

'From the outside I don't know how much more he could have done. In terms of results he's been terrific.

'I've been in management for 15 years now and two or three people have lost their jobs in the last 48 hours so I'm going to take a deep breath and enjoy the occasion.'

Early indications suggest Bruce will have no new injuries to contend with for the Saturday showdown with Arsenal and he acknowledges he faces one of the toughest decisions of his managerial career to pick his starting 11.

Bruce added: 'When it comes to such a big game I'll have to weigh it up and make sure everybody's in the right frame of mind. Physically they have all got to be 100 per cent.

'It's a new experience for me as a manager and it's a wonderful achievement for the club and the city.

'It's a working class city and if we can bring the cup back and give it something to shout about about it would be terrific.'
