This is the moment a group of 20 drunken thugs stormed a synagogue before hurling anti-Semitic abuse including 'Kill the Jews' at young worshippers inside.

The dramatic brawl broke out after the group forced their way into the Ahavas Torah synagogue in Stamford Hill, north London, where young people were marking the end of the sabbath.

The attack, which led to four men and two women being arrested, comes amid concerns about an increase of anti-Semitic attacks across Europe.

A Jewish patrol group, which works to reduce violence against Jews, said it had stepped up patrols in the area.

In a shocking video filmed at the scene, chairs are seen being flung against the double doors, shattering panes of glass, as men shout profanities at those desperately barricading the doors.

Those inside then start to fight back by throwing parts of broken chairs around the synagogue. This morning, a mound of broken furniture and trails of blood could be seen strewn across the building.

The incident is said to have taken place after the group attacked a young Jewish man outside the building, who is not a member of the synagogue. As he ran inside for refuge, the thugs chased him inside.

Police said some of the men did manage to briefly break into the synagogue, but were quickly thrown out again by security staff.

One man was injured as he sought to prevent the group from getting in. He sustained facial injuries, not believed to be serious. He was treated at the scene and did not require hospital treatment. 

Police said the attack  was not linked to Neo Nazis or Islamic extremists but was 'the completely unacceptable actions of a drunken group.'

A spokesman for Scotland Yard said : 'At this early stage, there is no suggestion that this was a far-right or extremist attack but rather the completely unacceptable actions of a drunken group.

'Four men and two women were arrested for public order offences and assault. All were taken to a north London police station where they remain in custody.

'Shomrin volunteers provided assistance to attending officers, helping with statements and the recovery of local CCTV footage.'  

Several elders were convinced the attack was not religiously motivated and was merely a typical example of anti-social behaviour.

David Mocha, 15, went down to the synagogue this morning to clear up after last night's violence.

Many of his friends were inside the synagogue at the time and one had his head smashed with a broken window.

He said: 'The Rabbi was telling me this was not an anti-Semitic attack but a fight outside that just got out of hand.

'But from what my friends have told me this was definitely an anti-Semitic attack. People were shouting 'kill the Jews'. I've seen videos of them chanting that. You can't say that's not anti-Semitic.

'One of my friends had a window smashed in his face. People were bleeding. There was blood and broken chairs all over the place when I came to clear up, it was much worse than it is now.

'I don't feel safe at all. My friends said they were terrified by what happened last night. I'm so scared sometimes I try to hide my Jewish identity.'

Yuri Simon, also a member of the synagogue, said his friends were also inside the building when the attack happened.

He said: 'This was obviously an anti-Semitic attack. My friends were inside the synagogue and I got a call from them saying what was happening.

'I was told there was an incident outside between a young man and a private party who were drunk.

'He went inside and they started attacking the synagogue, breaking the windows and forced their way inside. People were bleeding. The police arrested them. There were about 20 drunk people.

'There has been an increase in anti-Semitic incidents, people feel free to attack. There needs to be more security and tougher punishments.

'My friends were terrified by what happened, it's shocking. I think more incidents like this is the future in Britain. I don't feel safe in this neighbourhood any more.'

Meir Taub, who is a member of the local Shomrim, a Jewish patrol designed to crack down on violence against Jews, said he was called to the incident shortly after it began and was the first to call the police.

He said: 'I came down and there was a huge group of people, men and women, trying to force their way into the synagogue.

'The window had already been smashed. Teenagers were shouting abuse. It was blatantly anti-Semitic, they came and attacked a synagogue.

'I was on the phone to the police all the time, I didn't interfere but others did.

'The number of these incidents has increased in the past few months, since before Charlie Hebdo. We're stepping up patrols and working with the police. The courts should take attacks like this seriously.

A Jewish patrol designed to crack down on violence against Jews said it would be stepping up patrols and that attacks such as this should be taken seriously

'I have clear footage which I'm going to show to the police which clearly shows there were anti-Semitic chants.'

Bernard Grosskopf, who lives close to the synagogue, went to see what was happening after being woken up by the noise of the fight.

He said: 'It was quite something. Both groups were going at each other. The fight was crazy, it was pandemonium. I didn't get the feeling it was anti-Semitic though, just a normal fight.' 

Rabbi Maurice Davis said the first thing he heard about the incident was when he was contacted by the media this morning and asked for a comment.

He said he was '200 per cent' sure the attack was a normal Saturday night brawl and was not religiously motivated in any way.

He said: 'I've spoken to the patrol and looked at videos. It was depressing what happened but it definitely wasn't anti-Semitic. There is no anti-Semitism or racism in this area.

'There was a party across the road, they are a nice family, I know them. They had a fight with a young man in the street who ran into the synagogue and took refuge in the toilet.

'He was Jewish but not a member of the synagogue. Some of the drunken partygoers tried to break in and attack him but they were beaten back with chairs. They smashed windows and threw all sorts of things.

'I don't know yet what the cost of the damage is, but we will have to replace the door.'

Four men and two women were arrested for public order offences and assault. All were taken to a north London police station where they remain in custody. 

A police spokesman said: 'The disturbance began when a group of drunk males, believed to have walked to the area from a house party nearby, tried to gain access to the synagogue in Craven Park Road.

'One man was injured as he sought to prevent the group from entering the building. He sustained facial injuries, not believed to be serious, and was taken to hospital for treatment.

'A small number of the group did briefly gain entry to the synagogue before being removed by security staff.' 

They added: 'The incident is being treated as an anti-Semitic incident, due to remarks made by one of the group. However there is nothing to suggest that it was a planned or targeted attack. 

Inspector Jonathan Waterfield said: 'We are investigating to establish the full circumstances of the incident and to identify anyone else involved in the disturbance who has not yet been arrested.

'We have also increased police patrols in the Stamford Hill area to provide reassurance to the community.'

The Community Security Trust, which monitors anit-Semitic incidents, tweeted: 'We are aware of alleged antisemitic assault at synagogue in Stamford Hill & are working w. Police & community. Suspects have been arrested.'

Police have asked anyone with information which might assist the investigation to call Haringey CID via 101.
