Negligence claims: Ian and Nikki Singleton lost their twins after medics failed to spot a ruptured uterus

After losing their only son Josh at the age of 16, Ian and Nikki Singleton were desperate to build a family again.

They went through 13 bouts of IVF before Mrs Singleton became pregnant again – this time with twins.

But an inquest yesterday heard how the birth turned to tragedy following a string of medical failings.

Mrs Singleton was rushed to hospital suffering from severe stomach pain just 30 weeks into her pregnancy.

After being transferred to another hospital and enduring an agonising wait to be treated her baby boy Reuben was stillborn and his twin sister Esme died the following day.

The hearing found medics had failed to spot Mrs Singleton, 49, had suffered a rupture to her uterus when she arrived at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital near Cardiff in July 2009.

Her condition worsened as she waited two hours for a Caesarean section that resulted in Reuben being stillborn and Esme showing no signs of life.

After 22 minutes of resuscitation Esme began breathing again but she had suffered such severe brain damage that the Singletons – who lost their son Josh to a brain haemorrhage – agreed to turn off her life support machine the next day.

Aberdare Coroner’s Court heard midwives had ignored the warning signs of Mrs Singleton’s condition despite the fact she was in severe pain.

Consultant gynaecologist Hatel Tejura said the lack of uterine activity and a foetal heartbeat should have sent alarm bells ringing then.

The inquest was being held into the death of Esme only because there are no inquests into the deaths of stillborn children.

It heard that when Mrs Singleton 
arrived at the Royal Glamorgan a midwife could only detect one heartbeat
instead of the two there should have been.

But at this point at 12.40pm medics believed she was in premature labour and had not diagnosed a ruptured uterus.

There
was then a two hour delay before a Caesarean section was performed in 
which time Esme is believed to have suffered severe brain damage.

Glamorgan coroner Louise Hunt recorded a narrative verdict saying:  ‘Esme was well at 12.40pm – it is most likely there was a critical event then with things changing radically but not being appreciated by the medical staff. They have acknowledged that today.

‘Because it was not appreciated that she was in serious difficulties there was a considerable delay in doing a Caesarean section.

Esme was not delivered for two hours – more than enough for the damage to have been done.

‘She died from brain damage caused by the rupture which went undiagnosed in labour resulting in delay in the delivery.’

The inquest heard the local Cwm Taff Health Board had accepted failing in their standard of care and offered its apologies to the Singletons who were living near Cardiff at the time.

After the hearing Mrs Singleton, who now lives in Swindon, Wiltshire said: ‘This happened three years ago but the pain is still there and will never, ever go away.’

Her husband, 50, said: ‘We feel that Esme’s death was a mixture of incompetence, negligence and a cavalier attitude.’

The couple are pursuing a legal case against the hospital for negligence.
