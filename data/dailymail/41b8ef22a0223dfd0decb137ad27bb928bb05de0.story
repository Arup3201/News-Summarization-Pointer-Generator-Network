A Russian businessman who fell in love with a prima ballerina from the Bolshoi Ballet is paying the price of trying to match his superfit lover's physical abilities after he ended up being bedridden with back pains.

According to Russia's daily newswire Life News, Anastasia Volochkova, the 38-year-old ballerina lover of Bakhtiyar Salimov, 45, said that the injuries had been caused because they had been having sex together, after which he was left in such pain they had to call an ambulance.

Anastasia became known all over the world in 2003 after she was fired when the Bolshoi Ballet complained that she was too fat and, at five foot six inches, too tall. They argued that none of her male partners wanted to carry her.

Although she admitted she had a love of ice cream and couldn't imagine life without it, she told them that she felt weighing just 106 pounds was hardly overweight. 

She took the ballet to court, and was eventually awarded the equivalent of several thousand pounds in compensation and reinstated. However, the Bolshoi has not offered her a role since 2004.

She went on to launch a successful solo career before settling down.

According to the Life News report her partner Salimov has only recently recovered from a serious illness and the couple had been celebrating in their own way when he suddenly started suffering from incredible back pains.

She told the media group: ‘Bakhtiyar just could not get out of bed. We had been for a meal together to celebrate being back together and afterwards we put our feet up on the sofa. He didn't have any other exercise that day except for having sex twice. 

'Afterwards the pain was so bad from his back that we called the ambulance out twice but the medication they gave him didn't help. He can't stand up and is currently confined to his bed.’
