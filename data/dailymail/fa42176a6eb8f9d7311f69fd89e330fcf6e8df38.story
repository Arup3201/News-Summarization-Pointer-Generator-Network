A newly-married woman claims she was contacted by Facebook and asked to provide a copy of her ID because her name was 'too suggestive'.

Melinda Kiss, of Long Island, New York, married Bob on June 6 before the couple went off on their honeymoon.

When she logged in and made the request to go by 'Melinda Kiss Flecker' instead of just 'Melinda Kiss', she found the submit button on the form was grayed out and she was unable to perform the action.

'I went to click enter,' Kiss told Business Insider in an email, 'and I couldn't. It was grayed out.' 

Then a notification from Facebook asked her to send them a copy of an approved ID, including a birth certificate, driver’s license, passport or marriage license.

Mrs Kiss said she has been Melinda Kiss on Facebook for the past eight years.

Kiss said she sent a copy of her driver’s license but Facebook has yet to change her name.

'My entire family is on Facebook,' she told Business Insider. 'Our name has never been a problem. It's just kind of funny.'

Facebook has been plagued by issues relating to its filters.

In June the social network changed its rules to allow users to post photos of breastfeeding.

Following a major online campaign called #freethenipple, it has been revealed the social network changed ts policy - but has not explained why.

Mothers took to the internet to complain after it was discovered breastfeeding photos were being banned.

The social media giant has also had to deal with issues relating to hate speech, crude, violent, graphic and sexist content.

This year Facebook has also been removing pages marketing paraphernalia associated with the extremist group Isis that is terrorising Iraq and Syria.

'Where hateful content is posted and reported, Facebook removes it and disables accounts of those responsible,' a Facebook spokesperson said last month.
