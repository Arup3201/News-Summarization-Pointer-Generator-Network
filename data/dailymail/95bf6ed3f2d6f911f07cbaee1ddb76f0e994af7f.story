The girlfriend of murdered British millionaire Andrew Bush came face-to-face with the model accused of killing him moments after he was shot, it was claimed today.

Slovakian suspect Mayka Kukucova allegedly left his villa and calmly told Maria Korotaeva, who had heard shots but was unaware Mr Bush was dead, to get out of his car.

Miss Korotaeva, who turned 21 yesterday, refused until Kukucova told her: 'Andy is inside and wants to talk to you.'

Maria Korotaeva, 20 (left and right), the most 
recent girlfriend of murdered millionaire Andrew Bush, 48 (left), has 
told how the pair arrived at Mr Bush's Spanish villa to find 
ex-girlfriend Kukucova waiting

Kukucova has been accused of being a 'madly jealous' ex who killed Mr Bush to stop anyone else having him

Kukucova was arrested in Slovakia, 2,000 miles from the crime scene and appeared before a judge in a court in Trencin on Thursday.

She said that media reports on Mr Bush's death were wrong.

Miss Korotaeva, who turned 21 yesterday, told The Sun's Rachel Dale: 'She looked very normal but hard. She was so calm that it sends chills down my spine.

'I thought Andy was just inside the house. She said, "Andy has given me the keys to go to the airport".'

She
 said she tried to get into the villa before calling police, who 
eventually arrived two hours later. By then she said she was hysterical.

According to Netky.sk, Kukucova told Slovakian media: 'I let myself into the hands of police 
thinking that my country will provide me protection and without 
sufficient evidence will not extradite me to Spain, because everything happened differently than media has described it.'

Miss Korotaeva has accused Miss Kukucova of Mr Bush's murder, saying 'She done it. God will be her judge'

Kukucova's lawyer said that she did not know Mr Bush was dead and only 
learned about his death once she had left Spain, which she fled because 
she feared for her 'life and health'.

Kukucova has claimed she shot Mr Bush dead in self-defence following a furious argument about maintenance for their unborn baby.

The
 claim emerged as Mr Bush's family visited his villa to leave flowers 
and messages, with one, from his daughter Ellie, saying 'we will always 
love you'.

Kukucova, 24, was escorted by police 
officers to the region Court in Trencin after being arrested last Tuesday afternoon.

Mr Bush, 48, was shot in the head at his 
villa in Estepona, on the Costa del Sol, two weeks ago while visiting 
with his most recent lover, Maria Korotaeva.

On Thursday it was reported that, while Kukucova was missing, she sent her parents a
 text message saying she had shot Mr Bush in self-defence and Slovakian media said she would plead self-defence in court.

Spanish
 newspapers picked up on the claims and said she sent her family a text 
message insisting she had not planned to kill Mr Bush.

What's more, a source close to the investigation said that in the message she claimed to have been pregnant with Mr Bush's child, according to the Daily Mirror.

The source said: 'Mayka told them she went to Spain to discuss financial arrangements for the child with Mr Bush because he was refusing to speak to her.'

The source added: 'She says that she confronted him about it, but he then attacked her and she was forced to defend herself. She claims to have the bruises to prove it.'

Members of Mr Bush's family were visibly upset as they left flowers and messages at the villa on Thursday.

His ex wife Samantha Mason, 45, and her sister Rachel, along with daughter Ellie Mason, comforted each other outside the building during the visit, during which they also collected some of his personal belongings.

The jewellery dealer was shot twice in 
the head as he arrived at his five-bed holiday home in Cancelada near 
the resort of Estepona with new Russian lover Maria Korotaeva.
