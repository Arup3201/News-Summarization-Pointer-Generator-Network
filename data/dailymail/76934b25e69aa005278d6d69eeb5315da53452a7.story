Diego Costa is not used to being a substitute and the boredom of watching Spain cruise to victory against Australia clearly got to him.

The striker started Spain's opening two World Cup group games against Holland and Chile but found himself on the bench for Monday's clash as Vicente Del Bosque rang the changes after two consecutive defeats.

Next to him sat Xabi Alonso - who had come off with seven minutes of the game left to play. 

With the result beyond doubt and no prospect of getting on, Costa had an idea to keep himself entertained.

The 25-year-old appeared to try to wax his team-mate's leg with what looked like tape.

The prank barely registered with Alonso, who shot his team-mate a confused and unimpressed look and continued to enjoy the display his team-mates were putting on.

Opener: David Villa's first-half goal set Spain on their way to an easy win

At the double: Chelsea striker Torres makes it 2-0 to Spain after the break

Clincher: Juan Mata sealed the win with a third goal late on

The bizarre moment draws to an end Spain's disastrous World Cup defence. The 3-0 win over Australia, courtesy of goals from David Villa, Fernando Torres and Juan Mata, was scant consolation for a team used to so success.

For Costa the tournament has been a disappointing, with the striker failing to score. Although some mitigiation must be made for the fact he had just recovered from a leg injury.

Alonso, meanwhile, is rumored to be on the brink of intentional retirement. If the 32-year-old does call it a day, then at least he won't have to put up with Costa's pranks anymore.
