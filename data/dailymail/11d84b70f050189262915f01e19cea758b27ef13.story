On May 15th 2012, ADay.org asked people around the world to pick up 
their cameras and take a photograph.

What returned was an extraordinary collection of images - from the simple image of a mother feeding her baby in Pennsylvania, to the lonely image of an Inuit Eskimo fishing in Greenland.

The images will be published online and in a book (well, 1,000 of them) - and also locked in a copper mine in Sweden, giving future historians a glimpse of just one day on our planet.

Scroll down for video:

7:39am in Carrollwood, Florida: 'With lives already full of demands on their time, my children make the most of their morning commute to a Jewish private school in Tampa, Florida. My 12-year-old son, Ethan, is quizzing my eight-year-old daughter, Miriam, on this week's spelling list. In between words, he debugs the video game he's writing on his Mac'

09:54: This is my partner Michael Kristensen with the dogs near the Daneborg base on Young Sund Fjord. The dogs are Greenland Sled Dogs. They are gentle but untamed and spend the entire year outdoors. We plan our route by first dropping supplies by plane or boat.

16:45pm: 42 Saratov, Russia: The youngest members of the Saratov Ensemble rehearsing Russian folk songs for a forthcoming concert. They are playing single-row accordions with two bells, called Saratovskaya garmonicas after the city. At the piano is the ensemble director, Yevgeny Jarkin. The boys are aged between five and seven and have been playing for a year.

15:19: Salome Manuel has worked for 15 years at the Creek Road Market in Nigeria, selling okporoko (stockfish) caught in the creeks and rivers that flow down through southern Nigeria to the Atlantic. The dried fish ' red snapper and more ' are a popular feature of Nigerian cuisine, prepared by soaking and softening in stew.

From the 100,000 photographs taken and submitted, from 165 
countries, 1,000 of the best have been selected to appear in an 
astonishing new book - A Day In the World - published this week, documenting quite how extraordinary one seemingly regular 
day can be.

Organisers say the ADay project is the 'largest collaborative structured photographic 
event' ever undertaken, supported by many of the world’s leading public 
figures, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Deputy 
Secretary General of the United Nations Jan Eliasson, former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari  and entrepreneur Richard Branson.

The photographs convey sharp juxtapositions 
between different geographical regions and economic positions – one 
image pictures a Canadian man, comfortably tucked up in bed with his 
tablet computer and smartphone, whilst another shows homeless men asleep
on the pavements of Dhaka, a sad consequence of rapid population growth.

Similarly, many 
people chose to take pictures of the food they consumed on May 15th, 
showing the diverse range in diet around the world, from health food to 
fast food and surplus to scarcity.

It is also possible to compare 
different styles of architecture globally – affected by wealth, 
population size and culture – from the sky-scraping Petronas Towers in 
central Kuala Lumpa, to colourful, old wooden houses in Yekaterinburg in
Russia, to the shanty settlements of Rio de Janeiro.

'Some of my friends are Travellers and occasionally I look after their horses.

'This pony is Lodger, who was lent to us four months ago.

'I have tried not to fall in love with her since the owner might sell her some day, but she’s captured my heart.'

'My breakfast and the pug that coveted it. The dog’s name is Buella, and 'she belongs to my boyfriend’s cousin, Jenni.

Buella was right there, wanting my breakfast.

'I don’t think that Cinnamon Toast Crunch and a bagel with strawberry cream cheese particularly whet a dog’s appetite.'

12:58: When the Costa Concordia ran aground on 13 January 2012, the tiny island of Giglio suddenly found itself at the centre of a crisis. The islanders rose to the challenge, helping to rescue people at sea, then taking drenched and terrified survivors into their homes. Perhaps their kindness counterbalanced the infamy of the ship's captain, Francesco Schettino, who faces trial on charges of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, and abandoning ship. Of the 4,252 passengers on the cruise ship, 32 died. Somewhat uncomfortably, Giglio now finds itself a focus for disaster tourism.

16:14: 38 Stockholm, Sweden: 'Me and my boyfriend Ludvig went out for a walk and laid down on a football field. He told me I should upload a picture of when we kissed each other, and so I did.' The two, who are 18 and study sciences together at school, were best friends for two years before they started dating a month ago. Ludvig lives in Näsbypark, a Stockholm suburb.

19:37: Las Vegas, USA: 'The place was filled with tourists enjoying the evening and alongside the joyful crowd I found these two sorrowful faces in the sea of celebration. She is Clarice Schlegel, 43 years old and from southern California. Robert is not a regular on the street. Clarice moved to Las Vegas three years ago, right after her parents died. She thinks she might have a brother in Las Vegas. When I met Clarice again, she did not know where Robert had gone. Clarice is one of those people who live in the street, sunrise to sunset. When their bodies are almost giving up from the day's challenges, a shaded corner will be a resting place. I will be back in that same place where I found them.'

Alongside each photograph featured in A Day In The World are relevant 
details, including the name of the photographer, a description of what 
the picture is showing and its geographical location.

The photography 
shows a great variety of situations and subject matter, as well as 
technical specifics - from small pictures snapped on mobile phones, to 
larger, more professional compositions - all with their own sincere 
poignancy and resonance.

Celebrity
participants in the project, run by a Swedish charity, include Virgin 
boss Richard Branson, former Irish President Mary Robinson and South 
African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who said the photos would help people 
connect with one another and 'transcend the barriers of language, age, 
gender and culture'.

22:28: Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada: 'This is in the basement bedroom of my parents' house, where my boyfriend has been living for the past year. I sleep in my own bedroom two floors above, since we are unmarried.We are in our mid-20s and have been a couple since we were 17, living with parents to save money for our first home. My parents are devout Catholics, but neither my boyfriend nor I are. Under their roof, I usually respect their rules ¿ however, most nights we still get to spend time in private before I go upstairs to sleep.
Here, he has just gotten out of the shower. He is a basketball player and has been working out since he was a teenager. Contrary to his fit physique, another one of his night-time routines
is to eat half a bag of chips or a huge bowl of ice cream. When I had the camera out, he was a bit shy. In general he hates getting his picture taken but he is proud to show off his muscles. I think this photo captures our living situation right now: elusive, almost sec

09:38: 6. Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA: 'I look like I just rolled out of bed. I did. But mornings consist of getting the babe's oatmeal out of the fridge and the pureed prunes from the freezer to defrost a bit. Jude likes his oatmeal cold. At least he doesn't seem to mind it. I think that with teething (he just popped two teeth) it feels good on his gums. He's such a good eater.'

12:13pm: Jogeshwari East, Mumbai, India: A passion for cricket is something that unites Indians, whether rich or poor. A lack of proper facilities and equipment has never stopped children from practising the sports they love. These enthusiastic players are the children of dairy farmers, imitating their sporting heroes, such as fellow Mumbaian and legendary cricketer, Sachin Tendulkar
