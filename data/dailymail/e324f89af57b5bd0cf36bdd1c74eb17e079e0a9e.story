As a country known for its lavish tipping practices, there has always been a debate in America over how much to leave at the end of a meal.

For customers who have ever wondered how much staff at restaurants actually earn, new data has revealed on average, they receive a median salary of $13.30 an hour.

That includes a base salary of $9.90 an hour and earning $3.40 an hour in tips.

Surprisingly, the IRS estimates that up to 40 per cent of tips go unreported, meaning there is an estimated $11billion in unrecorded income, according to the Atlantic.

Staff who work at restaurants depend on 25 per cent of tips to make their total income, findings from a study by online salary-information company, PayScale, has revealed.

From the 15,000 restaurant workers surveyed in roles including barista, dishwasher, host and pizza chef, bartenders earn the highest tips.

Bartenders in general out-earn Bar Managers after counting tips - which makes up 59 per cent of their total income.

The top median earners of the study were bartenders in San Francisco, apparently the land of gracious diners. Workers reported earning $15.50 in hourly tips along with a base salary of $11 an hour, a total of $26.50 hourly (above a graphic representing income trends for waiters and waitresses across the country)

The top median earners of the study were bartenders hailing from San Francisco, apparently the land of gracious diners.

Workers reported earning $15.50 in hourly tips along with a base salary of $11 an hour, a total of $26.50 hourly.

In comparison, the worst place for bartenders to be is New York where the median amount earned in tips hourly is $7.10. 

Waiters and waitresses in San Francisco, Boston and Miami reported earning an average of $13.00 an hour in tips.

Sous Chefs and Head Chefs earn the highest salaries and men are more likely to hold these jobs, they study found. Males also tend to have roles in management and leadership more than females (above a graphic by job of median income for restaurant workers)

There was also a difference among genders when it came to reported hourly tips - women reported an hourly tip income of $3.70 as their counterparts reported $2.70 an hour.

However, men  reported a base salary of $10.40 an hour compared to the $9.60 an hour women make.

A survey from last summer revealed that across the states, the people who tip most often (as opposed to the largest) are in Illinois, with the Delaware residents tipping the least often.
