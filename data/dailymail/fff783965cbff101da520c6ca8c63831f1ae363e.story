While she's won rave reviews for her performance in Cake, seeing Jennifer Aniston in the same nominations race as Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon is an unexpected turn of events.

The two ladies are both nominated in the leading actress category at the 2015 Screen Actors Guild Awards, with Witherspoon earning a nod for her performance in Wild.

They join Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything), previous SAG winner Julianne Moore (Still Alice), and Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) in the stacked category. 

SCROLL DOWN TO SEE FULL LIST... 

Honoured: Jennifer Aniston was nominated in the leading actress category for the 2015 Screen Actors Guild Awards, which were announced on Wednesday morning in Los Angeles 

Competition: Reese Witherspoon was also nominated in the leading actress category for her role in Cake 

Aniston is a veteran of the rom-com genre and a fan favourite. Her dramatic turn in Cake is quite a departure for the actress and has been stirring up awards buzz in the past few months.

Witherspoon, however, is a force to be reckoned with after earning in 2006 the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and the Critics Choice Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of June Carter Cash in Walk The Line.

And Aniston could not contain her surprise when responding to her nomination, tweeting: 'This is the best 6:00 a.m. wake-up call ever. Words can't describe how blessed I feel to be recognized like this by my peers for this film. What an enormous feeling of joy and gratitude.'

In the ensemble cast category, nominations were awarded to Birdman, Boyhood, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything.

And the nominees are: The SAG Awards were announced by Eva Longoria and Ansel Elgort in LA on Wednesday

And the nominees, as to be expected, were thrilled by the honour, with Keira Knightley tweeting: 'Thank you so much to the Screen Actors Guild. It's such an honor to be nominated by your peers and in the company of this group of talented women. I'm thrilled to celebrate this morning with Benedict [Cumberbatch] and the cast.'

And Michael Keaton was keen on thanking his director upon hearing the news: 'As an actor being nominated by actors for playing an actor, I am truly, truly grateful for this honor. An ensemble like this hardly ever comes around, and all of us made this very unique film work - lead by our maestro, director Alejandro Inarritu.'

While Jake Gyllenhaal gave a shout out to his big sister: 'I am even more happy for my sister who I think is extraordinary in the honorable woman and it would seem that SAG thinks so too. My sister's a bada**.' 

Double threat: Michael Keaton and Edward Norton are both nominated in the leading and supporting categories, respectively, for Birdman

First timer: Eddie Redmayne is up for leading actor for The Theory of Everything

But for Ethan Hawke it had even greater significance: 'I've been acting for 30 years now. So the SAG nomination is genuinely meaningful to me. Particularly this year, with the loss of Phil and Robin, our acting community is more important to me than ever.' 

The awards were announced on Wednesday by Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria and Ansel Elgort of The Fault In Our Stars.

The Screen Actors Guild Awards will air next year on January 25, with the Oscars airing nearly a month later on February 22. 

Veteran: Ethan Hawke is nominated for best supporting actor for his work in Boyhood

Many of last year's SAG winners went on to claim Oscar gold, including Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyers Club), Cate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine), Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years A Slave), and Jared Leto (Dallas Buyers Club). 

Nearly every major acting nod handed out at the SAG awards was a precursor for the Academy Awards in 2014 - making it one of the best predictors for how this year's race will go.

The only category that did not match up was SAG's ensemble award which has no equivalent in the Oscars.  

SAG nominees are voted in by their peers with 4,200 members of the guild randomly selected each year to nominate their favourites.

Creepy turn earns him some accolades: Jake Gyllenhaal is nominated in the leading actor category for Nightcrawler

Back in the game: Patricia Arquette is up for supporting actress for her role in Boyhood

The voters are split in half, with 2,100 weighing in on television performances and the other 2,100 deciding who will be honoured for outstanding performances in film.

Following the polling process the full body of both SAG and AFTRA (Hollywood's acting unions) then decides upon the winners in each category. 

Among the big awards ceremonies, SAG is the first to announce their nominees, resulting in some major films not being included.

Last year The Wolf Of Wall Street failed to send in their screeners on time for the selection process thereby excluding it from the awards ceremony.

Stellar: Benedict Cumberbatch is another actor in the leading category for The Imitation Game

The year before Django Unchained ran into a similar problem and this year it is Selma (a civil rights drama starring Oprah Winfrey, Martin Sheen, and Tim Roth).

Much like all of the major awards shows the categories honour actors for leading roles, supporting roles and ensembles (differing from the Oscars, which only celebrates solo performances).

However, SAG is strictly a ceremony celebrating actors and actresses and does not recognize producers or directors.  

A dramatic turn: Steve Carell is nominated in the leading actor category for Foxcatcher
