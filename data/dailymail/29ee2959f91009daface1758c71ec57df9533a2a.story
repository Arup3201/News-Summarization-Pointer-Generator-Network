The Fort Hood army doctor awaiting trial for a gun attack that killed 13 fellow soldiers and injured 32, has been paid $278,000 since the shooting on November 5, 2009.

Soldiers injured in the horrific attack at the Texas army base are fighting to receive the same pay and medical benefits as those injured in combat, but the Department of Defense confirmed that Major Nidal Hasan has continued to be paid.

The Army said that under the Military Code of Justice, unless Hasan is found guilty, his salary cannot be suspended.

Army Specialist Logan Burnett, who was shot three times at the Army Deployment Center, is appalled that the accused gunman is still being paid.

'There have been times when my wife and I
 cannot afford groceries. We cannot afford gas in our car,' Mr Burnett, who has since retired, said. 'This makes me sick.'

If the army psychiatrist had been a civilian employee at the base, the Army could have suspended his pay after only one week, NBC5 Investigates said.

Personnel rules for most civilian 
government workers allow for 'indefinite suspensions' in cases 'when the
 agency has reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a
 crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed'.

The continued salary is just one of several battles victims of the shooting are fighting.

Because the Army classified the shooting as workplace violence rather than being combat related, and refuses to call it a terrorist attack, the gunman's victims have been denied benefits they would ordinarily be entitled to.

Under the combat related classification, servicemen would be entitled to the pay, Purple Heart retirement and medical benefits afforded to soldiers wounded in war, or during the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon.

This means that Mr Burnett, who had been due to go to Iraq before the shooting, and the other victims and their families, are missing out of thousands of dollars in benefits and pay each year.

On the third anniversary of the shooting, victims filed a lawsuit against the Army to try to win back the rights to the benefits they claim they are entitled to.

Mr Burnett was appalled when he was shown a letter from the Department of Defense confirming Hasan had been paid more than $278,000. The letter was a response to a request by NBC5 Investigates under the Freedom of Information Act.

Mr Burnett, who now lives in Arizona, said: 'I honestly thought I was going to die in that building.'

The former reservist, who needed to undergo surgery several times and still suffers from post-traumatic stress, said the attack was like being in combat.

'You take three rounds and lose five
 good friends and watch seven other people get killed in front of you. 
Do you have another term that we can classify that as?' he said.

His wife, Torey, told NBC5: 'They don't need to be treated like 
this. They don't need to sit and fight every day for this benefit or 
that.'

Shawn Manning, who was shot six times and still has two of the bullets lodged in his body said: 'It was no different than an insurgent in Iraq or Afghanistan trying to kill us.' 

He estimated that the ‘workplace violence’ classification has cost him almost $70,000 in benefits that would have been available if his injuries were classified as ‘combat related'.

‘Basically, they're treating us like I was downtown and I got hit by a car,’ he told ABC News.

The victims are being supported in their fight by Republican Congressman Thomas Rooney.

'We're giving the defendant in this case
 every benefit of the doubt. But yet we're not giving the benefits to 
the victims,' Mr Rooney, a former Fort Hood prosecutor, said.

He has signed a bi-partisan letter urging Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to reclassify the attack as combat related, adding that  the situation has 'resulted in an embarrassing lack of care and treatment for the victims and their families'.

'What happened here was an attack on our military by a terrorist element specifically targeting our military,' Mr Rooney, who represents Florida said.

The campaigner for veterans' rights added that he would be willing to consider whether Congress should update its rules so that the army could suspend the pay of soldiers accused of harming their fellow servicemen.

One of the police officers who helped stop the gunman, said: 'We've asked for the incident to be reclassified from “workplace violence,” of all things, to what it was, which was a terroristic attack.'

Sgt Kimberly Munley, who has since been laid off from her job at the base, says the victims have been forgotten by those who promised to care for them.

FBI reports showed Hasan was communicating with Al Qaida before to the shooting. The National 
Counterterrorism Center also lists the Fort Hood shooting as a 'high 
fatality terrorist attack'.

The Army turned down further requests from NBC 5 Investigates about Hasan's pay and the classification of the shooting.

Its Chief of Media Relations said: 'The Department of Defense is committed to the integrity of the ongoing court martial proceedings of Major Nidal Hasan and for that reason will not further characterize, at this time, the incident that occurred at Fort Hood on Nov. 5, 2009.'

It is possible for the Army to recuperate some of Hasan's salary if it demands that he pays for his medical costs after being shot by a police officer. It is not yet clear if the army will do this.

It is not the first time that Hasan's salary has been highlighted. In July 2010 Bank of America closed his account and the doctor struggled to find another financial institution willing to accept his army pay, according to Statesman.

John Galligan, his civilian attorney, said he and his staff tried to open accounts in Hasan's name at several banks but were turned down.

Earlier this year, an army spokesman said any government declaration that Hasan is a terrorist could mean a delay of another 'year or more' in a trial which has already been pushed back several times by lengthy debates over Hasan's beard and other side issues.

'Such an unprecedented action would thwart the real and lasting measure that will bring closure to the grieving and harmed victims, the trial itself,' the Army concluded.

Hasan, who had been due to work in Afghanistan at the time of the attack, faces the death penalty if convicted by a military jury on 13 specifications of premeditated murder.

The American, who is now paralyzed from the waist down, is due to go on trial later this year.
