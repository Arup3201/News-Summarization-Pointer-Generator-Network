Oz is an award-winning oriental long haired cat who captured the attention of spectators at the Royal Easter Show in Sydney for the distinctive markings on her nose that bear a striking resemblance to a map of Australia.

‘Oz was on display yesterday and we all just thought ‘Wow, this is the most amazing cat we have ever seen,’ Anne Fawcett, a volunteer vet who spotted Oz at the show, told Daily Mail Australia.

Oz was born with black markings on her nose but it was only as she started to get older that she realised the remarkable likeness they had to a map of Australia

Oz is owned by cat breeder Deborah Nugent who told Daily Mail Australia the Sydney show was the young cat's debut on the show circuit.

She said Oz was born with a 'black splotch' on her nose but it was only as she started to get older ti developed the remarkable likeness to a map of Australia. 

Oz is due to mark her first birthday this week and Ms Nugent said she had intended to take her home in time to celebrate. 

But Oz's popularity at the show has meant Ms Nugent is now considering bringing the cat back to the show on Thursday so her fans can get the chance to meet her.

Judging from the pictures, it looks like the map is missing one very important feature, the southern island of Tasmania.

Dr Fawcett said if you look closely you can see a small black marking on the bottom of Oz’s chin.

‘There’s definitely a little Tassie under her chin. It’s a bit more central and probably a bit bigger than the real Tassie but it’s definitely there,’ she said.

She said even though she was wrapped up in Oz's striking markings it was clear she also had a ‘beautiful’ nature.

‘Oz has the look and the temperament to match. She is a real sweetheart.’
