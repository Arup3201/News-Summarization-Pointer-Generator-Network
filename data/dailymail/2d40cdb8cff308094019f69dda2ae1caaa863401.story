A woman watching the football at home with her family said she got the surprise of her life when one of their snacks wasn't quite what they had bargained for.

Jessiica McDonald, from Darwin in the Northern Territory, said she and her family were having a few quiet drinks on Sunday afternoon when her dad opened up a packet of beef jerky.

'We were just having a few beers watching the footy, and he grabbed a packet of jerky out', Ms McDonald told Daily Mail Australia.

Without even realising it her dad then reached into the packet, and apparently pulled out a cane toad and took a bite out of one of its legs.

'He said it was really crunchy and had a really nasty taste', Ms McDonald continued.

'It wasn't beef jerky at all.'

She said fortunately she was not the one to take a bite, but her father wasn't so lucky.

Describing it as 'absolutely putrid' the Darwin woman told NT News her family were disgusted by the gruesome discovery.

Her father was apparently so engrossed in the football he didn't realise what he had eaten until it was too late.

Cane toads produce poison through its parotid gland and some parts of its body are poisonous for many species including humans.

Ms McDonald said her father hadn't suffered any illness from ingesting the toad.

However as cane toads continue to populate the Northern Territory, some cooks have decided to take the opportunity to create their own delicacy from them.

The cooks have started using the legs of the pest species in six different dishes and are dubbing it the 'new feral fine food'.

Darwin food blogger Emma Lupin said earlier this year the cane toad was overlooked as a food source.

Ms Lupin's blog – Growing and Understanding Local Produce – is part of a community project that focuses on using locally grown foods.

She and other members of the GULP community have come up with many recipes that incorporate the pest, and have developed ways to kill the animal so it releases the least amount of poison possible.
