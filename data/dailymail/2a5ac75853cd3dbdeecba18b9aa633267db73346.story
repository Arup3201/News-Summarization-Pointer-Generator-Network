Darren Sweeby, pictured, was jailed for two years for orchestrating the parking scam which cost Great Yarmouth Borough Council and estimated £34,000

Three parking wardens who switched off pay and display machines and wrote out handwritten tickets to holiday makers have been jailed after their scam was exposed. 

The trio are believed to have stolen £34,000 from visitors to Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, since January 2009. 

Norwich Crown Court heard that the three men, one of whom was a parking supervisor, switched off the machines and told motorists that they were broken, before issuing handwritten tickets. The men then kept the money. 

Parking supervisor Darren Sweeby, 43,  and his two accomplices Garry Greensmith, 52, and Antony Crooks, 54, moved around various carparks in Great Yarmouth on bank holidays. 

Prosecutor said the men kept the money and were only discovered when a whistleblower approached the council who observed the trio on CCTV.  

Sweeby, of Gorleston, a supervisor who was in charge of keys to switch ticket machines on and off, was jailed for two years at Norwich Crown Court.

Greensmith, of Blundeston, near Lowestoft, Suffolk, was received 12 months.

Crooks, of Gorleston, went to jail for four months.

Mr Shaw said footage showed Greensmith and Crooks patrolling North Drive car park, Yarmouth, in May 2013, when father-of-three Sweeby was their manager.

Greensmith was seen opening the ticket machine and switching it off.

He sold handwritten tickets for cash together with Crooks before switching the machine back on and leaving an hour later.

The pair then moved to nearby St Nicholas car park where they did the same.

The three men were arrested in July 2013 and had their computers and mobile phones seized.

Crooks told police that he and Greensmith were told by Sweeby to act 'when crowds built up on bank holidays', said Mr Shaw.

Judge Nicholas Coleman, sitting in Norwich Crown Court, pictured, said the men had been guilty of 'calculated dishonesty' claiming they 'were expected to protect public revenue, not steal it'

He said the council believed they'd been operating the racket since January 2009 - when Sweeby was promoted to supervisor.

The authority believe the men stole about £34,200 based on comparable takings.

Honest parking wardens have been subjected to more 'abuse and aggression' from the public, who said they were 'lining their own pockets', since the truth emerged.

All three men admitted conspiracy to steal.

Michael Clare, defending Sweeby, said he had worked for the council for 14 years, had three young children and hoped to get work on a wind farm.

Andrew Oliver, representing Crooks, said he was not involved until 2012, showed genuine remorse and it was 'out of character' for him.

John Morgans, defending Greensmith, said he was not in good health and was 'remorseful'.

Mr Morgans insisted Greensmith and Crooks were mere 'footsoldiers' while Sweeby was the 'ringleader'.

Judge Nicholas Coleman said they'd all been guilty of 'calculated dishonesty'.

The judge told them as he put them all behind bars: 'You were employed as civil enforcement officers and you were the public face of the local authority.

'You were expected to protect public revenue, not steal it.

'You were in positions with a high level of trust.'

Last night Great Yarmouth Borough Council said it had sacked all three disgraced wardens and reviewed procedures after the astonishing scam.

A council spokesman said: 'The borough council welcomes the outcome of this court hearing, which proves that those who conspire to steal from the public cannot escape justice.

'The borough council always conducts the appropriate checks of anyone it recruits, and takes seriously any breaches of the law and the officers' code of conduct.

'After the borough council became aware, in June 2013, of potential issues within its parking services operation, officers were suspended pending a full two-month internal investigation, which culminated in dismissal at a disciplinary hearing.

'The police conducted a separate investigation.

'The borough council has now tightened up its procedures and training to significantly reduce the risk of this happening again.'
