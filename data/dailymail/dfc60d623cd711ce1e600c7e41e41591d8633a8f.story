A jobless woman who boasted of spending thousands of pounds of her benefits on a life of luxury - including £4,500 on breast enlargement surgery - has been jailed for persistent shoplifting.

Kelly Fannin had managed to escape jail three times in five years for a series of previous thefts but has now been imprisoned for 16 weeks.

She admitted a spate of shoplifting in Truro and Falmouth in Cornwall which netted her nearly £3,000 of goods.

Jailed: Kelly Fannin had managed to escape jail three times in five years for a series of previous thefts but has now been imprisoned for 16 weeks.

Fannin  - a mother-of-five by four different fathers - blamed her children for the latest offence, saying they had damaged their rented home and she was struggling to pay the cost of the repairs and the rent.

Fannin became notorious in October 2010 when she boasted that she splurged much of her £29,000-a-year benefits on luxury items, running up £10,000 debts on credit cards.

She told Closer magazine, using the name Kelly Marshall: ‘Some people might think I'm a scrounger but I don't think me or my children should miss out on nice things just because I have never worked.

‘I've wanted a boob job since I was a teen but it wasn't until I had the five kids that I could afford it with the extra benefits I get.

'I really do want to have liposuction, a tummy tuck and Botox and the kids agree Mummy should have the best.

‘All mums should be able to have cosmetic surgery. I don't care that it's at taxpayers' expense.’

In the last five years the 34-year-old had been given two suspended jail terms and a curfew.

She is well known to store staff and detectives and has been caught on CCTV de-tagging items before leaving shops without paying.

Shameless: Kelly Fannin, who gave a notorious interview under the alias Kelly Marshall, boasted about how her benefits were used to fund a luxury lifestyle and her expensive taste in clothes

She carried out some of the offences with another adult - and others with some of her children in tow.

The children aged between four and 18 are now being looked after by another member of the wider family.

Fannin
appeared at Truro Magistrates Court where she admitted stealing shaver 
equipment and an electric toothbrush worth £640 from Boots in Truro and 
cosmetics worth £150 from the same store in Falmouth.

She asked for four other offences including stealing perfume worth £1,200 to be taken into consideration.

Sergeant Gary Watts, of Devon and Cornwall police, welcomed the jail term and hoped it would serve as a deterrent to others.

He
said: ‘We have to ensure persistent offenders are brought to justice 
and it is good the courts have taken justice and the impact on the 
community into consideration.

‘She
is well known to us and at particular times of the year can be one of 
our worst offenders. Shoplifting should never be a lifestyle choice and 
this is a warning to others who choose to do it.’

Her
lawyer Jeremy Leaning told the court that she was struggling to make 
rent payments and pay money for repairs to the family home in Falmouth, 
Cornwall.

He argued before that her children would suffer if she was jailed but she was told that had been her 'last chance'.

A judge previously told her that she was a 'near professional shoplifter' and said she had been 'perilously close to prison'.
