A Manchester United supporting family have been given suspended jail sentences after they became involved in a fight with a stag party dressed as 'Where's Wally?' characters.

John Eyre, his sons Jack and Rhys, and their friend Ross Hunter were at Piccadilly station in Manchester on March 2, 2013, when they encountered the stags.

The incident occurred after United beat Norwich 4-0 at Old Trafford, with the opposing groups heading in opposite directions.

Moving on separate travelators, linked to platforms 13 and 14, the violence broke out after they began goading each other.

John Eyre leaned over the rail and pushed a 'Wally' before getting off to continue his assault but then fell flat on his face.

Eyre's sons then rushed to join the fray and Jack Eyre attacked the 'Wallies' with a crutch while a mass brawl erupted Phil Dobson, prosecuting, said.

John Eyre, 46, Jack Eyre, 22, Rhys Eyre, 17, and Ross Hunter, 17, all of Chesterfield, admitted affray. Wally Stephen Hargreaves, 54, of Radcliffe, was found guilty of affray at trial.

The Eyres had watched Manchester United beat the Canaries that day, and visited several pubs, while the stag party had set off from Bolton at 10am and been drinking all day on the Yorkshire Ale Trail.

Mr Recorder Williams, sentencing, said: 'This was disgraceful - you consumed such a quantity of alcohol that your judgement went out of the window.' 

Explaining why he wasn't locking them up, he added: 'I take the view that it's more important that you keep your jobs and make some kind of repayment for this, and I'm persuaded you will not get into trouble again.'
