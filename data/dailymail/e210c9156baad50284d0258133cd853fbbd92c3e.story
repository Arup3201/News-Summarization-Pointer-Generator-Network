'One of life's beautiful people': New mother Kirsty Treloar was stabbed 29 times by violent ex-lover Myles Williams

A controlling lover who sent a New 
Year text message to his girlfriend vowing to 
stop hitting her before brutally stabbing her 29 times hours later was jailed today.

Myles
Williams, 19, was jailed for a minimum of 28 years at the Old Bailey after he was found guilty in September of killing Kirsty Treloar, 
20, in front of their baby daughter and wounding the young mother's brother and sister.

Miss
Treloar was stabbed just hours after Williams sent her a text message 
at 11pm on New Year's Day saying: 'Okay wer all gud now and my new yrs 
ressy is that I aint going to hit u again and I won't hit u 4 this yr 
next yr the yr after that the next yr after that.

He
added: 'But I wont u to swear on (their daughter's) life u wont p*** me
off and do things to make me angry love you 4 eva.' (sic).

She was killed just three weeks after giving birth to the couple's baby, who was showered with her blood.

Williams stabbed her for being a 'white bitch' who was taking him for a fool.

Sentencing
Williams, Judge Nicholas Cooke said: 'Beyond a shadow of a doubt, you 
represent an exceptional danger to any future female partners,'

He added: 'Exceptionally, this was a fatal attack in the presence of a 26-day-old child.

'That
child has been left fatherless and motherless, and some time in her 
life she will discover that her father killed her mother.

'That baby was left covered in blood, probably her mother’s - a terrible thing.'

Crispin Aylett QC, prosecuting, told the trial of Williams’s empty promise at New Year.

He said: 'This can only be described as a conditional New Year’s resolution. It lasted only until the following morning.'

'Dangerous': Myles Williams was jailed at the Old Bailey for murdering Kirsty Treloar

Seven hours after sending his text, 
Williams received a reply at 6.30am on January 2 from Miss Treloar 
saying she did not want to see him.

He broke into her family home in Hackney, east London, through the kitchen window and launched the knife attack on the trainee nursery nurse.

When
her brother Dean, 23, and sister Gemma, 24, tried to help they were 
also stabbed, Mr Treloar in the chest and his sister cut on her arm.

'Okay wer all gud now and my new yrs ressy is that I aint going to hit u again and I won't hit u 4 this yr next yr the yr after that the next yr after that. But I wont u to swear on [their daughter's] life u wont p*** me
off and do things to make me angry love you 4 eva.' (sic)

Myles Williams New Year's text message

Williams
dragged Kirsty into the back of his mother's Fiat Stilo and drove her away. She was later found 
dead behind wheelie bins near the abandoned car two miles away.

As he left the scene he boasted to a bystander that she was a 'white bitch' who had taken him 'for a fool' and added that she 'needs to die'.

Judge Nicholas Cooke QC praised the young mother for her 'courage of the highest order' in protecting her family as she was being dragged away. Her sister Gemma pleaded with Williams not to take her but she whispered 'Gem, let me go' fearing that he would attack her family again.

He added that Williams had added 'humiliation to brutality' by dumping her body by bins, rejecting his claims that he was trying to get her to hospital.

Williams, who has an IQ of just 66, calmly spent the night with another woman before his arrest.

Miss Treloar’s mother Pamela said in a statement that Williams had devastated a close family.

She said: 'Myles Williams has taken a decent, loving, close family and ripped us up.

'Kirsty
was one of life’s beautiful people. She was gentle and had a heart of 
gold. Kirsty loved life and was always smiling. She could not wait to 
start her life as a new mum.

'She called her daughter her little princess. We will one day have to explain to her what happened to her mum.'

The
court heard the couple began their relationship a year earlier when Miss Treloar met Williams as he swept streets outside Hackney Job Centre.

He manipulated her into seeing him by lying that he was 23 and hiding the fact he had already fathered two children by two other older women.

But their relationship quickly began to go downhill, with Williams erupting in fits of jealousy, during which he would lock his lover in her bedroom for days.

Soon 
Miss Treloar was pregnant and the affair had turned sour.

In December last year Williams was charged with threatening behaviour after he dragged Miss Treloar along the street.

He
was taken to court and given bail on condition that he did not contact 
Miss Treloar, who days earlier had given birth to their daughter, said 
Mr Aylett.

Despite the bail conditions the pair continued to meet up over the Christmas period.

Scene: Myles Williams, 19, burst into Kirsty Treloar's family home in east London on January 2 and stabbed her 29 times

But on January 2, Williams kicked in a
kitchen window and then kicked in the bedroom door where the two 
sisters had locked themselves in and rang the police.

In a recording of the 999 call, Miss Treloar can be heard to plead: 'Myles, please don’t.'

Mr Aylett said: 'He hit her a number of times. He then started stabbing her with the knife.'

Dean Treloar was stabbed after hitting Williams over the head with the bar of some weights in a vain attempt to get him to stop.

Williams then went back to Miss Treloar and began stabbing her in the chest.

Mr Aylett added: “The defendant then dragged his half-dead girlfriend out on to the street and bundled her into his car.

Detective
Chief Inspector Andy Yeats said after the case: 'This was an appalling 
and violent attack by an individual with a propensity for violence 
towards women.'
