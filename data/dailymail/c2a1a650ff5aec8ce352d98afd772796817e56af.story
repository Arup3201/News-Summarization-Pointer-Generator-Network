A photo has emerged of a brazen fan of the popular television fantasy series apparently smoking a homemade bong while sitting on a replica of the Iron Throne in Sydney.

The photograph, published on Reddit and website Pedestrian TV, was taken at a promotional event for the show in Martin Place in Sydney earlier in the year.

The picture comes as Australian fans faced waits of up to five hours for their chance to walk through a Sydney exhibition of items from the HBO show at the Museum of Contemporary Art this week. The exhibition featured not only the Iron Throne, but costumes, weapons and a 'virtual reality' experience that allowed visitors to be become one of the Night's Watch.

The event where the man is pictured smoking the bong was from a promotional competition in which the person who posted the best selfie won the replica throne.

The selfie competition ran in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane in the lead-up to the premiere of season four.

A Foxtel spokeswoman said that the man jumped the barricades surrounding the throne and had his photo taken at the end of the day, after close to 1,000 people had come to Martin Place to get their photographs taken on the throne.

'They were hanging around waiting, but there were a lot of people hanging around, it's Martin Place,' she told MailOnline.

'Basically it was a security breach. [Staff] were packing up, he and his mates had planned it, he jumped the barricade,' she said. 'He took off, but obviously not before the photo taken.'

'It happened really quickly… it was so hit-and-run. The staff didn't even know a photograph had been taken.'

But Reddit users applauded the prankster's audacity and suggested this might be the start of a new trend.

'This should become the new "coning". Smokin bongs in weird places,' wrote chilledStudios.

'He looks so smug,' wrote wildernes84.

The Iron Throne in the MCA exhibition was shipped to Australia for the free five-day exhibition, which US cable network HBO put together to say thank you to the shows devoted Australian fans.

Liz Anderson, a spokeswoman for the exhibition confirmed, that the Game of Cones photograph had not been taken at the exhibition.

'I don't know when it was taken, but it had nothing to do with the exhibition,' she said.

'All of our fans have been respectful, our fans wouldn't do anything like that. It's a bit of an idiotic thing to do.'
