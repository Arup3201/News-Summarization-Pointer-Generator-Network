Secretary of State for Health Andrew Lansley told an NHS conference in Manchester tomorrow's doctors' strike is 'pointless'

Just eight per cent of doctors working for the NHS in England went on strike today, the Department of Health has claimed.

But despite only 11,500 doctors taking part in the action over the Government’s controversial pension reforms, patients will feel the impact after their appointments and operations were pushed back.

One in 10 patients and a quarter of GP practices were affected by the action, with about 2,000 surgeries having at least one member of staff taking part.

A Department of Health spokeswoman said that about 2,700 non-urgent operations were cancelled and 18,750 outpatient appointments had to be rescheduled as a result of the action.

In some areas of England, 37 per cent of GP surgeries would see only those patients in urgent need of care as doctors took action for the first time in almost four decades.

Figures from strategic health authorities across England showed the action affected services at 24 per cent of practices.

The figures, an early indication of the effect the action is having across England, show that there are varying levels of support around the country.

In some places up to a quarter of GP surgeries are affected by the action. But in other areas 'only a handful' of doctors are taking part.

Details of the scale of industrial action taking place in individual regions are shown below.

The numbers emerged after Andrew Lansley today attacked striking doctors, saying the pension deal they are fighting for would come at the expense of lower-paid NHS staff.

The BMA's demands would undo efforts to ensure porters and nurses do not lose out on their fair share of pensions, the Health Secretary said.

Earlier he urged doctors not to participate in today's 'pointless' strike, warning them it will achieve nothing.

The comments followed his revelation last night that pension contributions for doctors have cost the taxpayer £67billion.

Doctors themselves, thousands of whom 
are expected to be on strike today over reforms to their pensions, have 
only paid £17billion towards their retirement, the Health Secretary 
said.

Mr Lansley revealed that the 
public were funding 80 per cent of doctors’ pensions, and the total cost
 of the pension pot of all working and retired doctors is a massive 
£83billion.

Patients who fall ill
 today were urged to seek advice on the internet or ring an NHS helpline
 instead of trying to see a doctor.

With thousands of GPs and hospital 
doctors on strike, the public have been warned they may be turned away 
unless their condition is life threatening.

Last night the Department of Health 
told patients to trawl the NHS Direct website if they felt unwell, or 
call its helpline if they were still worried.

A NHS Direct spokesman admitted staff 
were ‘preparing for the worst’ and said extra workers had been laid on 
in preparation for an unusually high number of calls.

Meanwhile A&E departments across 
the UK were bracing themselves for the thousands of patients who could 
descend on hospital waiting rooms after being turned away from GP 
surgeries.

Today’s strike, 
organised by the BMA, has led to the cancellation of up to 30,000 
operations, ranging from hip replacements and cataract removal to 
heart-bypass surgery. Another 1.25million GP appointments have been 
postponed along with up to 58,000 hospital tests and scans.

The BMA has threatened to organise 
further strikes if the Government does not reconsider its reforms. 
Ministers want to increase the amount doctors contribute from their 
salaries and raise the retirement age. But the BMA claims this is unfair
 as they already pay a higher proportion into their pensions than others
 in the public sector.

Speaking on ITV’s Daybreak, the 
Health Secretary accused the BMA of pushing for a deal that would be 
unfair on lower-paid NHS staff.

Mr Lansley said: 'We needed something that was 
fairer for other NHS staff as well, the contributions do need to be 
properly progressive and they do need to reflect the highest paid paying
 a greater proportion into their pensions overall.

'We had a pension scheme in the NHS 
where, quite often, the highest paid got twice as much back, by way of 
pension benefits, than lower paid. I did set out to make sure that low 
paid and medium paid staff in the NHS did not lose out and that meant 
that the higher paid paid more.

'I’m afraid we are in a position 
where the BMA are out on their own and what they seem to be aiming for 
is to try and change things back so they get more and nurses and porters
 and others in the NHS get less.'

Last night the Prime Minister urged 
doctors to put their patients first. Speaking from the G20 summit in 
Mexico, David Cameron said: ‘I don’t think it is the right thing for 
them to do. I have huge respect for our GPs. My family and I have really
 benefited from that first-class service and we should be very proud of 
what we have in Britain.

‘Our primary-care GPs are well paid, they deserve to be well paid. They get good pensions, they deserve to get good pensions.

‘Even
 after these reforms, they will have the sort of pensions many people 
working in private-sector companies can only dream of. So I don’t 
believe they should be on strike.’

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley also made a last-ditch plea to doctors to reconsider.

Addressing health service managers at
 the NHS Confederation conference in Manchester, he said: ‘The strike is
 pointless. It will achieve nothing. I want to call again on doctors to 
think again before taking part in a strike that will be damaging for 
patients.’

But the BMA has stressed its members do not want to jeopardise their relationship with patients

The union's chairman of council Dr Hamish Meldrum said that the doctors’ fight is not with patients but with the Government.

Mr
 Meldrum said he hoped that after today’s day of action the union could 
reopen negotiations with the Government, adding that 'nobody wants a 
repeat of this'.

A survey by the Daily Telegraph suggests support for the strike is lacking in hospitals and surgeries across the country, casting doubt on the BMA's claim that it has a 'strong' mandate for today's action. It found:

He told Daybreak: 'I hope (the action) is not pointless and futile because we are very anxious to seek a resolution to this dispute and if this helps to highlight the problem and to get to that resolution then I hope it will have some point to it.

'Nobody is happy about taking any sort of action that impacts adversely on patients. There has been a lot of soul-searching at the BMA but we have to represent our members’ views and nearly three-quarters of those who voted wanted to take this sort of action because of what was happening to their pensions.'

Meanwhile, Sir Bruce Keogh, the head of the NHS, has written to the most senior doctors at every hospital in the country urging them to ‘act in a way that ensures the health, safety and well-being of patients’.

It is not yet known exactly how many doctors are taking part in today’s strike or how many surgeries will refuse to treat patients who are not seriously ill.

To avoid patients being turned away, the Department of Health is advising them to use the NHS Direct website or call the helpline on 0845 4647. It urges them not to use A&E units or dial 999 as a substitute for a GP appointment.

Lisa Potter, of NHS Direct, said: ‘We are planning for a worst-case scenario. We expect it will be extremely busy. We are encouraging patients to use the symptom checker on our website to keep the phone lines free to people who really need to speak to someone.’

Dr Vincent Argent, from Worthing Hospital, said: ‘We are anticipating it will be a lot busier than usual. Doctors from other departments may be required to help in A&E.’

The BMA announced the action after a ballot of more than 100,000 doctors showed a clear majority in favour of protests on a high turnout of 50 per cent.

In the last few days, however, it has emerged that many doctors are having second thoughts about the protest.

Early polls suggest as few as 22 per cent of doctors will be participating, while yesterday two surveys revealed that up to three quarters of surgeries could be running as normal.
