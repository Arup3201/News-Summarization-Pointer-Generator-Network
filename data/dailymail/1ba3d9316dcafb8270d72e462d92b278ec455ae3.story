Queiroz was Sir Alex Ferguson's No 2 at Manchester United

Carlos Queiroz quit as manager of Iran on Wednesday night after a Bosnian side inspired by Edin Dzeko ended their hope of progressing into the knockout stages of the World  Cup.

Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko ensured already-eliminated Bosnia secured the first World Cup victory in their history by scoring the opening goal and setting up a second for Roma's Miralem Pjanic in Salvador.

Iran fought back to score their first goal of the tournament through Charlton's Reza Ghoochannejhad but Bosnia quickly restored their two-goal advantage with a fine effort from Avdija Vršajevic to leave Queiroz's side bottom of Group F.

Sir Alex Ferguson's former No 2 at Manchester United confirmed afterwards his stint in Tehran was over after three years.

He said: 'I've shown my commitment to this project, but I haven't received any new contract offer.

'It's been an honour for me to work for Iran, I've fallen in love with the country. But you can't have a marriage when only one side wants to commit.

'I waited for them to make an offer, but I haven't received anything, so today I've come here to say 'thank you' to those who gave me the opportunity to do this job.

'I will always have Iranian football, my players and the fans in my heart.'

Bosnia didn't want to end their debut World Cup without a point after narrow losses to Argentina and Nigeria.

Dzeko had seen a goal wrongly disallowed and also missed several chances in that game so he was relieved to shoot Bosnia ahead after 23 minutes with a left-footed strike outside the area.

Rain on his parade: Queiroz said he hadn't been offered a new contract by Iran football

For once, he was left free by white-shirted defenders and took full advantage with a clinical finish that clipped off the inside of the post.

Iran have been one of the best teams in Brazil in terms of defensive organisation but toothless up front which cost them in a 1-0 defeat against Argentina when Lionel Messi scored late on.

The irony yesterday was that when they tried to push forward seeking the win to take them into the last 16, Jalal Hosseini needlessly gave the ball away and Dzeko reacted quickly to play in Pjanic to score.

Ghoochannej finished smartly from six yards after good work from Javad Nekounam down the left to briefly give Iran some hope.

But that evaporated 120 seconds later when the overlapping Vršajevic fired in his first international goal from a tight angle to atone for an earlier miss he'd made from Dzeko's through-ball.

An emotional Queiroz added: 'We pushed ourselves to the limit, mentally and physically and I'm very, very proud of them. Despite all our difficulties, we kept pushing and created some good chances, but Bosnia-Herzegovina were better today.'

Bosnia's win was a great source of pride. A new nation of just four million people, their real victory was to reach the finals having overcome a war in the 1990s that killed 200,000 people.

Even so, their goal celebrations were subdued as if they realised they should have probably been in the last 16 themselves.

Back of the net: Ghoochannejhad's celebration is muted as Iran still need to score two goals to progress

Dzeko was criticised for wastefulness against Nigeria but he blamed the New Zealand referee Peter O'Leary for Bosnia losing that key game.

Even so, several of their players will have enhanced their reputations in South America including £15million-rated Stoke City goalkeeper Asmir Begovic.

Meanwhile, Iran will lament a lack of firewpower up front. With a World Cup record of one win in 12 - against the USA in 1998 - they lack belief to go with their technical ability.

Salvador  maintained its reputation as the Brazilian venue for goals - four matches there have yielded 21.
