Charles Saatchi bought 12 identical suits so he could dress the same way every day, according to the Grillos

Owning just one suit costing £1,000 is quite an investment for most men, but Charles Saatchi bought 12 identical ones so he could dress the same way every day.

He would team the Paul Smith suits with one of 25 white shirts, each costing £155 from Prince Charles’s shirt-maker Turnbull & Asser, according to his former housekeepers.

Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo revealed how the multi-millionaire advertising tycoon is ruled by obsessive routines so he accumulates large quantities of identical items – from suits to bottles of lemonade, and from TV remotes to tubes of hair gel.

They also told how the favourite possession of Mr Saatchi and his then wife Nigella Lawson was a stuffed bulldog called Narles – and how he requested burnt toast every time he ate breakfast.

The sisters said Mr Saatchi ordered them to stockpile his favourite drinks – cloudy lemonade from Waitrose and ready-made Frappuccino drinks from Starbucks.

The 70-year-old even told staff to pack bottles of the drinks in his suitcases every time he went away and he once demanded his staff buy 12 Apple TV remote controls at £15 each so he could always find one.

The Grillos – who were last week cleared of a £695,000 credit card fraud against their former employers – said their life working for Mr Saatchi and the ‘domestic goddess’ was governed by a series of bizarre orders.

Each day started at 6am, they claimed, so they could hide any trace of Miss Lawson’s cookery or late-night takeaways as Mr Saatchi insisted that the kitchen should always be spotless.

He demanded a breakfast of burnt toast and a cup of weak tea every day at 7am.

However, first he would cut his own hair each morning before applying his favourite Philip B Crème of the Crop hair gel.

He told staff to buy 60 tubes of the £30 gel so that he would never run out of it. Next he would put on one of the designer outfits that he had in his wardrobe.

The Grillo sisters said the tycoon – worth an estimated £135million – only dressed in the identical suits from British designer Paul Smith, which he would team with the Turnbull & Asser shirts.

The uniform would be completed by one of 30 pairs of £290 black suede Totes loafers and a cashmere Calvin Klein coat. Mr Saatchi lunched in a private room at Montpeliano restaurant in Knightsbridge, West London, on weekdays.

At the weekend he booked the same outside table at Scott’s in Mayfair – the restaurant where he was pictured grabbing Miss Lawson’s throat during a row this summer.

Miss Grillo said the tycoon also demanded the heating was kept on year-round at their townhouse, even if the sweltering heat meant staff had to leave windows open.

He hated rooms being dark so insisted every light in the house was kept on all day.

The sisters worked for the couple from 2001 and said Saatchi shipped in a special strong toothpaste, Clinomyn, from the US where it is popular with smokers. He also kept a bag of cash on top of the fridge so staff could use it for his requests, including buying supplies of eggs.

The Grillo sisters said staff were also sent to nearby Annabel’s nightclub to fetch bottles of his favourite red wine from the club’s cellars.

Francesca Grillo described how she would spend hours ensuring Mr Saatchi’s whims were obeyed. She added: ‘It took me ages to turn all the lights off at night, but Charles hated it being dark. He also like the heating on all the time so we’d keep the windows open.’
