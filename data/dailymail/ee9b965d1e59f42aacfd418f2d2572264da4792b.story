Swansea City are hopeful of wrapping up a move for Tottenham full back Kyle Naughton.

Sportsmail understands a fee is believed to have been agreed, with Tottenham thought to have placed a valuation in excess of £4million on the right back.

Naughton has played in only five games for Mauricio Pochettino this season and has been told he can leave.

Naughton has only made five appearances for Spurs this season and has been told he can leave this window 

But his ability to play on either side of defence appeals to Garry Monk, who is keen to strengthen at both left and right back.

Swansea’s existing left back Neil Taylor has struggled to fill the void left by Ben Davies’ summer departure for Tottenham and is a target for Crystal Palace. Meanwhile, long-serving right back Angel Rangel is 32 and there were doubts last month over his ability to play three games in a week.

Norwich left back Martin Olsson is on Monk’s wishlist, though it is understood that his potential arrival would not have any bearing on whether they sign Naughton.
