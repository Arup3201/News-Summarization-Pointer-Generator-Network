Calling all high-flying couples looking for a first class weekend away, this is a luxury hotel suite built into an airplane.

Complete with its own sauna, hot tub and three flat screen TVs, the features on this disused 1960s plane is a far cry from some budget airlines.

The Airplane Suite, at Teuge Airport in the Netherlands, will even let customers play pilot and stewardess with an in-built flight simulator.

This is the Airport Suite at Teuge Airport in the Netherlands which is built into an old aircraft

The high-flying hotel room comes equipped with a sauna (right) and a hot tub (left) for guests to relax in

The disused plane also has a flight simulator in the cockpit for anyone wanting to play at being a pilot

For those who want to take to the skies 
for real, you can also book helicopter tours, flying lessons, parachute 
jumps and a ride in a stunt plane.

Guests can book their stay on board the lavish 40-metre long aircraft with prices starting from around £300 per night.

Steve Dobson, Co-Founder of UnusualHotelsoftheWorld.com, said: 'This is a luxurious single suite in an authentic plane, situated in Teuge Airport.

A runway stay at the unusual suite will set holidaymakers back by £300 per night

The luxurious interior is a far cry from what passengers of budget airlines may have come to expect

'The facilities are fantastic. It's got a rainfall shower, sauna and an untouched flight deck for playing pilot and stewardess.

'It's a favourite for romantic celebrations and offers a truly unique experience so you'll need to book well in advance to come on board.'

Passengers can also enjoy some 'in-flight' entertainment with a selection of Blu Rays and DVDs on board, as well as helping themselves to drinks from the mini bar - though perhaps not before taking to the controls.

There will be no worries about dodgy airline food on board as the plane comes with an oven and microwave

Anybody wanting to take to the skies for real can also book a helicopter ride, a parachute jump or a flying lesson

The Ilyushin 18 plane was built in 1960 and in its first years served as a government plane for German diplomats.

From 1964 to 1986 it was used as a tourist plane taking up to 120 passengers to countries such as Cuba and Russia, before being transformed into a restaurant for 15 years.

Eventually it was bought by Hotelsuites.nl in 2007 before being turned into the luxury accommodation it is today.
