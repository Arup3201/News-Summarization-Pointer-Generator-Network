Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul has been switching Xbox consoles on without permission.

A TV advert starring the actor has left users of the Microsoft device bemused, and thousands have complained, because it takes advantage of the consoles' voice commands.

In the ad, 34-year-old Paul uses the Xbox One's voice controls by saying 'Xbox On' so he can start playing on the console.

Breaking Bad actor, Aaron Paul, (pictured) is switching everyone's Xbox consoles on without their permission. A TV advert starring the actor has left Xbox users bemused and annoyed, and thousands have complained it accidentally turns their consoles on

But thousands of gamers found the clip was able to also activate the voice recognition software on their own consoles, and turn them on.

Gamer Tom Neal, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire is just one of many people who have taken to Twitter to complain about the advert.

He tweeted: ‘@Xbox your new TV advert is annoying the hell outta me. Aaron Paul keeps turning my console on? Stoooop.’

The advert is showing on channels all over the world, and is meant to showcase the console's (pictured) features, including voice-activated commands. Earlier this week, Microsoft announced that it would start selling the Xbox One console without the Kinect for the first time

At the start of the 30-second clip, the Need for Speed actor, 34, says: 'After the role of a lifetime, I've been - busy. Xbox On'

The advert is showing on channels all over the world, and is meant to showcase the console's features, including voice-activated commands.

At the start of the 30-second clip, the Need for Speed actor, 34, says: ‘After the role of a lifetime, I've been - busy. Xbox On.’

He also tells his console a series of other commands, including 'snap TV' which puts a small live TV window in the corner of the screen and to 'record that' - which records high definition footage of gameplay.

Another advert showing Paul using voice commands to play the sci-fi shooter Titanfall is thought to have similar effects.

However, Xbox One owners who want to avoid issuing or receiving accidental commands can disable the Kinect sensor.

Earlier this week, Microsoft announced it would start selling the Xbox One console without the Kinect for the first time.

The company hopes the move will allow it to match the price of Sony’s rival PS4 console. The new price for the console without the Kinect is $399 in the US and £350 in the UK.

Microsoft
 focused exclusively on hyping titles coming to its Xbox One and Xbox 
360 consoles during its presentation Monday ahead of the Electronic 
Entertainment Expo, the game industry's annual trade show.

The
 new Xbox One games included a fresh installment of the open-world romp 
'Crackdown'; a reboot of the Xbox action game 'Phantom Dust'; the 
original dragon-centric adventure 'Scalebound' from developer Platinum 
Games; a sequel to the 2013 'Tomb Raider' reboot titled 'Rise of the 
Tomb Raider'; and a 'Halo' collection that will bring four prior 
installments of the sci-fi shooter to Microsoft's latest console.

Phil
 Spencer, head of Microsoft's Xbox division, began the 90-minute 
presentation by noting that Microsoft changed features of the Xbox One, 
which launched last November, after listening to consumer feedback.

When
 the company initially unveiled the Xbox One last year at its Redmond, 
Washington, headquarters, Microsoft billed the $499 console as an 
"all-in-one" entertainment hub for the living room.

Microsoft
 Corp. has lagged behind Sony Corp. since both companies began selling 
their latest consoles last November. Microsoft has sold 5 million Xbox 
One consoles to Sony's 7 million PlayStation 4 units. However, both 
companies have outpaced the sales of their predecessor consoles — the 
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 — during the same time period.
