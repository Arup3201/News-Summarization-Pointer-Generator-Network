The two remaining cities bidding to host the 2022 Winter Games have submitted their candidature files and guarantees to the International Olympic Committee.

With several other potential bidders pulling out of the running only Beijing, China and Almaty, Kazakhstan are left in the reckoning.

Krakow (Poland), Lviv (Ukraine), Stockholm (Sweden) and Oslo (Norway) all submitted a bid to the IOC but they were scrapped due to either a lack of public or political support in their own countries.

The National Olympic Committee of Kazakhstan present their bid files to the IOC 

Their Chinese competitors for the 2022 Winter Olympics also presented their files to the IOC

The files submitted by Almaty and Beijing include details of each city's bid, outlining important issues such as financing, venues, transportation and security.

An IOC evaluation committee will visit the cities in February and March to properly investigate the bids with a report to be produced in either May or June.

The host city will then be chosen by the full IOC on July 31 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Beijing, the city which hosted the 2008 Summer Games, is rumoured to be the favourite.

But the event in seven years' time is guaranteed to be the second consecutive Winter Olympics to be held in Asia with Pyeongchang in South Korea hosting in 2018.

Staff carry the necessary files into the IOC building in Lausanne, Switzerland

Beijing, who hosted the summer tournament in 2008, are favourites to land the games
