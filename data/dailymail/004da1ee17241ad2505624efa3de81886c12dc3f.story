Loss: Meredith Kercher, who was murdered in 2007 in Perugia, Italy. A coroner has concluded she died 'unnaturally'

Exchange student Meredith Kercher was unlawfully killed, a coroner has concluded, nearly seven years on from her murder in Italy.

In a brief hearing at Croydon Coroner's Court in south London, coroner Dr Roy Palmer said Miss Kercher met her death 'unlawfully' at her home in Perugia, Italy, over the night of November 1 and 2 in 2007. Her throat had been slashed.

'She died, the autopsy tells us, as a result of haemorraghic shock from stab and incised wounds to the vasculature of the neck. I do conclude that she was unlawfully killed,' said Dr Palmer, senior coroner for the south London area.

'On the night of the first and second of November 2007 Meredith was found in her bedroom at a residence in Perugia, Italy. It was clearly an unnatural death.

'Three individuals were arrested and tried. One male was convicted and did not appeal.

'The other two were convicted and appealed and the present position I believe is that there are further proceedings currently in Italy.'

None of Miss Kercher's relatives were present for the five-minute hearing.

'The family I think are keen for closure and after all these years later I can bring some closure by completing the inquest and inquisition,' the coroner added.

Coroner's Office manager Barry May said he had liaised with Miss Kercher's brother, Lyle, who had spoken to family members, and they were 'content' for the proceedings to take place in their absence.

Italy's highest Court of Cessation ruled in March 2013 to overturn the acquittal of Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher

An inquest had to be opened in this country because Meredith, known to family and friends as Mez, suffered a 'violent and unnatural death.'

In January Amanda Knox, 26, and Raffaele Sollecito, 29, had their guilty verdicts reinstated at Italy's highest court for the murder of Leeds University student Miss Kercher.

Knox was sentenced to 28 years and six months while Sollecito was jailed for 25 years.

The pair were originally found guilty of murder in 2009.

They were cleared nearly two years later - when Knox returned to the US - but the appeal court ordered a fresh trial last March.

Prosecutors claimed that Miss Kercher, of Coulsdon, Surrey, was the victim of a drug-fuelled sex game gone wrong but the defendants have consistently protested their innocence and claim they were not in the apartment the night she died.

Rudy Guede, a drug dealer, is serving a 16-year sentence over the death, though the courts have said he did not act alone.

Knox has refused to go back from America for the hearing saying they would have to drag her 'kicking and screaming.'

Last month it emerged 27-year-old Guede, an Ivorian, has been allowed out on day release after just six years to study.

Earlier this year Miss Kercher's sister Stephanie said the victim 'had been forgotten' in the media storm surrounding Amanda Knox.

She added her family had struggled to keep their memories of her alive when press coverage of her murder focused on another person.

'Everything that Meredith must have felt that night. Everything she went through. The fear and the terror and not knowing why. She didn't deserve that. No one deserves that.

'We all definitely want some sort of closure. Just having an end of the Italian justice system and knowing that's the final decision, and then we can start to remember just Meredith,' she said.

Speaking of when she last saw her sister alive as she prepared to study in Italy as part of her Leeds University course, Ms Kercher said: 'She was very excited about coming to Italy, looking forward to learning about Italian culture.

'Seeing the city of Perugia and making new friends. She really fought to be here. She wanted to be here.

'We were just talking on the sofa and having a little cuddle of goodbye and I just remember her suddenly crying and saying that she was going to be sad to go but she was excited to come and I remember being quite taken aback and I thought, "Don't make me sad. I'll miss you but you'll go and have fun",' she said.

Ms Kercher's brother Lyle also spoke of struggling to cope with his sister's death and said of the new guilty verdicts: 'It's not the end of it. It's another chapter moving things forward.'

'Anybody losing anyone close is hard, losing someone so young and the way we did is obviously 100 times worse, and on top of that to have all the media attention that has gone for so long makes it very difficult to cope with.'
