A baby delivered by emergency cesarean section after his mother suffered a brain hemorrhage just six months into her pregnancy is preparing to head home after more than a month in hospital.

Brayden Ellison weighed just 3 pounds 6 ounces when he was delivered in Tarzana, California on July 21 - and family members have called him a 'miracle', KTLA reported.

But his mother, 21-year-old Kayla Katler, did not survive.

At six months pregnant, she had gone to the doctor with a bad headache and when it did not improve days later, she was taken to hospital, where doctors discovered she had a 3mm blood clot.

She suffered a deadly seizure, forcing doctors to act quickly to save her unborn son.

Her sudden death has shocked family and friends, who said she was active and healthy.

'I have my moments of, "Why me?"' her boyfriend Derek Ellison told NBC. '"Why would we be brought together just to be ripped apart?" I went into this looking forward to raising a son with Kayla and in one minute I became a single father.'

But he said the overwhelming support he has received from the community has helped immensely.

Strangers and friends have donated diapers, clothing, car seats and baby furniture through a Facebook page, Support Baby Brayden Ellison. 

Kayla's cousin Nicki Ciancio posted that the young mother-to-be had not even had time to have a baby shower before her sudden death - and strangers were soon donating gifts, she said.

Ever since the boy was born, Ellison has visited him in the NICU at Tarzana Providence Medical Center, and on Tuesday, he will be taking the little boy home.

'With the support system I have, there's not a lot to be afraid of,' he told KTLA.

But the day is bittersweet for other family members.

'It's really sad to know that she's not the one bringing him home,' Kayla's mother Christy Katler said. 'That's the way it’s supposed to be.'

Ellison said he is learning to cope with the death of his beloved girlfriend, whom he met a year ago, one day at a time. He has taken some solace in knowing her organs were donated.

The family has set up a Gofundme page to cover Brayden's medical expenses and college fund.
