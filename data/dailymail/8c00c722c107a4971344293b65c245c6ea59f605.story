A father who was told he was too radioactive to hold his newborn son has overcome cancer to finally cuddle his boy.

Calvin Innes, 29, was diagnosed with cancer just two weeks before the birth of his son, Cohen, in June.

The 29-year-old children’s book illustrator had thyroid cancer and immediately underwent surgery to have a tumour removed from his throat.

The surgery went well and he was healthy enough to be present when his wife, Kali, gave birth to their son.

Several weeks later however, Mr Innes began drug therapy which involved taking a daily cocktail of drugs to prevent the cancer - which had already reached his tonsils, thyroid and the lymph nodes - from spreading any further.

One of the drugs was radioiodine which make a patient's body become radioactive. Because of this the new father was suddenly unable to enjoy bonding with his new son.

Mr Calvin, from Hull in East Yorkshire, said: 'When you take the pills you become radioactive and for three weeks I wasn’t allowed near my newborn son.

'I couldn’t pick him up, I couldn’t feed him, play with him or change his nappy.

'It was awful because I was having to watch my wife Kali do all these things and I was unable to help.

Mr Innes has stopped drug therapy and is now able to cuddle and bring up his son

'While you’re on the treatment, they have to check you with a Geiger counter every day to see how radioactive you are and if you’re safe to be around people.'

Calvin, who owns publishers My Little Big Town, underwent radioiodine therapy for three weeks.

The strength of the pills were enough to cause potentially fatal health problems if he got too close to his son.

Mr Innes said: '[Getting cancer] was a complete bolt from the blue.

'It’s like a hammer blow. I’d never in a million years have expected it. You think that’s the sort of thing that happens to other people, not you.

'I found out I had cancer two weeks before my son was due so it completely knocked me for six.

'All I was thinking was "Am I going to see my son grow up?" or "Am I going to see him born?"

'I’d had a lump on my neck for a couple of months before but I hadn’t really thought anything about it. I felt fine.

'Then I finally went to the doctor, he said ‘we’d better get it checked out’ and it turned out it was cancer. It’s hard to take in at first.'

Since stopping treatment last month, Mr Cohen has been told is free of the thyroid cancer which spread to his tonsils.

He is now just waiting for the final results, to confirm that the cancer has not spread to any major organs in his body.

Radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy.

The treatment uses a radioactive form of iodine called iodine 131 (I-131). The radioactive iodine circulates throughout the body in the bloodstream.

Radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy, administered as a capsule or drink

Thyroid cancer cells pick up the iodine wherever they are in the body. The radiation in the iodine then kills the cancer cells.

Radioactive iodine is a targeted treatment. It doesn't affect other body cells, because only thyroid cells take up the iodine.

The treatment is usually administered as a drink or capsule.

Patients having radioactive iodine treatment in hospital are looked after in a single room until their radiation levels have fallen again.

The treatment causes the patient to be slightly radioactive for a few days, so time spent with staff and visitors is minimal.

Sweat and urine also become radioactive, so bedsheets are changed every day and patients have to flush the loo more than once.

Pregnant women and young children will not be allowed to visit.

Even 12 weeks after treatment, patients who have had radioactive iodine therapy may set offradiation alarms at airports.

Calvin Innes, 29, from Yorkshire, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and underwent surgery on his throat two weeks before his son was born

@highlight

Was prescribed radioiodine tablets which made him become radioactive

@highlight

His radioactivity levels were so high he was not allowed to cuddle or even be in same room as newborn son Cohen as babies are vulnerable to effects

But Mr Innes has come off the medication and is now able to cuddle baby Cohen and help bring him up
