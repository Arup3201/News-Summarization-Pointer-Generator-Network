A four-year-old girl whose mother and sister were shot dead in front of her revealed the identity of the suspected gunman to detectives, it has emerged.

When armed police officers arrived at the murder scene in Lawrenceville, Georgia - at which two other people had also been killed - they heard shuffling noises from the upstairs of the house.

They pointed their guns in the direction of the noise and demanded that the person reveal themselves.

At that point, young Nhaje Butler came out into the open from behind a stair rail and held up her hands in surrender.

Gwinnett County Police Sergent Kevin Eisenhouer said she then calmly told officers 'he's gone' and said 'Rich killed my whole family'.

The revelations of the girl's extraordinary bravery were revealed during witness statements at the trial of Nhaje's mother's boyfriend, Richard Ringold, 47.

He could get the death penalty if found guilty of the four murders in August 27, 2009.

Prosecutors say Ringold shot Atania Butler, 28, after the pair had had an argument. The court was told that, the day before the shooting, she had discovered Ringold was cheating on her with another woman.

They allege that after the pair had had an argument, he shot his girlfriend and then raced through the house shooting at her daughters, Nhaje and 11-year-old Jhane.

He is also alleged to have shot Miss Butler's 19-year-old roommate Rico Zimmerman and LaKeisha Parker, 30, who was a blind and mentally challenged woman who Mr Zimmerman was caring for.

The only survivor of the shootings was Nhaje.

Speaking yesterday at the start of the second week of witness statements at the trial, Sergeant Eisenhouer said he picked up the youngster into his arms and asked if she was ok after she emerged in front of police officers at the murder scene.

But she replied: 'No, he shot me, too.'

Sgt Eisenhouer told the jury that when carrying Nhaje outside of the house, he had to cover her eyes as he stepped over the body of her mother which was sprawled across the entrance to the front door.

After Nhaje was passed onto paramedics, she asked that they did not cut off her shirt because it had been given to her by her mother and it was one of her favourites.

After lifting the shirt over Nhaje's head, paramedics discovered she had been shot through the chest and left shoulder.

The brave youngster had also placed Band-aids on her chest and arm in an attempt to dress her own wounds before the emergency services arrived.

Now 7, Nhaje is expected to take the witness stand today. Ringold has pleaded not guilty. The trial continues.
