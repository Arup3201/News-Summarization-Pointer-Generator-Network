A top professional gambler described as 'arguably the best poker player in the world' is suing a London casino for his £7.7million 'winnings'.

American Phil Ivey has brought his High Court claim over a version of baccarat cards known as Punto Banco which he played at Crockfords Club in Mayfair over two days in August 2012.  

Genting Casinos UK Ltd, which owns Crockfords, says that the technique of edge-sorting which Mr Ivey used - which provides the customer with an element of 'first card advantage' - is not a legitimate strategy and that it has no liability to him.

After four sessions, Mr Ivey was told that the money would be wired to him and he left for the United States. 

But the money never arrived - although his stake of £1million was returned.

The company claims that Mr Ivey's conduct defeated the essential premise of the game of baccarat so there was no gaming contract - or constituted cheating.

Mr Ivey was accompanied at the 186-year-old casino by a companion Ms Cheung Sun also known as Cheung Kelly.

Richard Spearman QC, representing the 38-year-old, told Mr Justice Mitting that the casino's case - that his conduct amounted to cheating -was 'plainly unsustainable|'.

He said that edge-sorting involved nothing more than using information that was available to any player simply from viewing the backs of the cards which the casino chose to use. 

It also involved making requests of the casino - which it could accept or refuse - as to the manner in which play was conducted, he said.

Mr Spearman added: 'Moreover, it is very easy for the casino to protect itself against the technique, not least by checking the cards for asymmetrical patterns before they are used in play, by not re-using the same cards after a shoe (the receptacle holding the decks) has been played, and by the elementary step of turning some of the cards once between shoes.'

'The central issue is whether the practice of edge-sorting which the claimant carried out in order to improve his betting opportunities and enabled him to win £7.7million, which he claims he won entirely lawfully, is a lawful or unlawful practice.'

He described a casino as a 'cat and mouse environment'.

'It is an adversarial environment. Obviously, it does not mean you can be dishonest - we do not suggest that. But, you have to look at those circumstances when you consider cheating.

'The environment is a highly relevant feature and you have to look at the attributes of the person accused of dishonesty - a professional poker player who has an international reputation as an advantage player.'

He told the judge: 'Our firm position is that the guts of cheating does involve dishonesty. It is the heart of the case. It has got to be grappled with.'

He said it was a serious matter for Mr Ivey who was charged with something which the defence said was a criminal offence or, if not that, conscious impropriety or lack of probity.

Mr Ivey is described on the World Series of Poker website as 'arguably the best poker player in the world'.

Mr Spearman said: 'You may have your own views about the standing of professional poker players but that is his occupation and it is a serious charge.

'He (Mr Ivey) regards this as utterly fair play. If the casino fouls up from start to finish, that is something which is the gambler's good fortune . It is not an easy thing to do. It requires a lot of skill.'

The casino's counsel, Christopher Pymont QC, told Mr Justice Mitting - who is hearing the week-long action in London - that Ivey was not a well-known advantage player at the time of his visit but was, in their eyes, an old VIP customer and they trusted him accordingly.

It argued that edge-sorting was not a widely known or practised way of playing baccarat in the UK and that the casino was not unduly careless in failing to prevent it .

'The scheme could have been - and was - cheating, however widely known or practised edge-sorting may have been in other casinos at the time, and however careful or careless the casino may have been to prevent it in this case,' he said.

'Hence the suggestion that the casino was acting at its own risk is irrelevant, It has no bearing on the core issue in this case, which is whether the scheme was cheating.' 

The case continues.
