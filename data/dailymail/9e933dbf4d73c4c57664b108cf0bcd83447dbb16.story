They have cheated justice for nearly 19 years.

But the rest of the Stephen Lawrence killer gang were warned yesterday that they will not get away with murder.

Jailing Gary Dobson and David Norris for the ‘terrible and evil crime which scarred the conscience of the nation’, Mr Justice Treacy dramatically ordered Scotland Yard to hunt down the ‘three or four’ killers still at large.

Flashpoint: Neil Acourt (number 1) his brother Jamie (2) and Luke Knight (3) are among the gang who came out fighting after the public inquiry in 1998

Police, he declared, should not ‘close the file’ on the case.

His forthright comments were backed 
by Stephen’s parents, Neville and Doreen, and prompted the Metropolitan 
Police Commissioner to pledge that the remaining suspects ‘should not 
rest easily in their beds’.

Significantly, police have already received a number of calls about Stephen’s murder since Tuesday’s convictions.

The trio of 
men long suspected of joining Dobson and Norris in the ‘racist and 
thuggish’ South London lynching in April 1993 are brothers Neil and 
Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight.

Their names were handed to police 
within days of Stephen’s murder and all five were named by the Daily 
Mail as killers in 1997 and challenged to sue if the newspaper was 
wrong. They never did.

Outside the Old Bailey Mr Lawrence 
said he hoped Dobson and Norris would ‘give up the rest of the people’ 
involved and effectively handed officers a 12-month deadline to make 
fresh progress.

‘One of my greatest hopes is that 
these people have now realised that they have been found out, and they 
are now going to go and lie down in their beds and think that they were 
the ones who were responsible for the death of my son,’ he said. ‘And 
they are going to give up the rest of the people so that I (can) come 
out here again in a year’s time and talk to you people again.’

Stephen’s mother Doreen told the 
Mail: ‘There is no shred of doubt in my mind that all five are guilty. 
After Stephen’s death we had people we don’t know leaving messages and 
giving us their names. We would have had no idea about these young men, 
who they were and where they lived, but we were getting these messages 
about their behaviour; the way they cleaned knives in front of their 
windows, attacks on other people.

‘So with that combination of things, 
and then seeing the police surveillance video where it’s clear the 
hatred they have for individual races, you think, no, it has to be 
them.’

Met chief Bernard Hogan-Howe insisted
detectives would go after the remaining suspects. He urged people to 
come forward with information which might prompt new charges.

The new phase of the marathon 
Lawrence investigation is expected to focus on the Acourt brothers and 
Knight, who were in hiding last night after apparently fleeing their 
homes. It is also likely to include a renewed attempt to identify a 
possible sixth member of the gang.

The comments of Mr Justice Treacy, in
a packed but silent courtroom at the Old Bailey, will terrify the 
Acourts and Knight, who have so far dodged justice over Stephen’s 
murder. After jailing Dobson and Norris and praising the detective who 
helped put them behind bars, the judge said: ‘At least a measure of 
justice has been achieved at last.

‘However, the convictions of Gary 
Dobson and David Norris will not, I hope, close the file on this murder.
On the evidence before the court, there are still three or four other 
killers of Stephen Lawrence at large.

‘Just as advances in science have 
brought two people to justice, I hope the Metropolitan Police will be 
alert to future lines of inquiry, not only based on developments in 
science but perhaps also information from those who have been silent so 
far, wherever they may be.’

Police plan to meet next week to assess where the case stands.

Dobson, 36, and Norris, 35, were 
convicted on Tuesday of the racist murder of Stephen. Dobson, who is 
already serving a five-year sentence for drug-dealing, was sentenced to 
at least 15 years and two months.

Norris was given a minimum of 14 years and three months for what the judge described as a ‘terrible and evil crime’.

on trial for the murder of Stephen Lawrence six weeks ago. Both men 
denied the charge

In court, Mr Justice Treacy called 
forward Detective Chief Inspector Clive Driscoll, who has been the 
senior officer in the case for a number of years.

He told him that the public inquiry 
into the circumstances surrounding Stephen’s death had ‘shamed and 
humbled’ the Met, but praised the hard work done in recent years.

The evidence in the trial could not 
prove who wielded the knife, but he said that whoever used it had done 
so with Dobson and Norris’s ‘knowledge and approval’.

Neither of them had shown ‘the 
slightest regret or remorse’ since the murder and they had both lied to 
the court. At Scotland Yard, Mr Hogan-Howe said his officers would 
continue their inquiry into Stephen’s murder, adding: ‘We can make a 
difference in this case still.

‘The other people involved in the 
murder of Stephen Lawrence should not rest easily in their beds. We are 
still investigating this case.

‘If anybody out there has any more 
information or any evidence, even after all this time, please tell us 
then we’ll do the rest. All we need is help.’
