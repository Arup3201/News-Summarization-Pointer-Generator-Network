Authorities across the Channel have decreed that the English term 'sexting' is to be henceforth known in French as 'textopornographie'.

L’Académie française made its pronouncement earlier this month, ruling also that the imported gerund's associated noun, 'sext', must to French speakers become 'texto pornographique'.

And if that's a bit of a mouthful for heavy breathing French lovers the Académie has also suggested a ready-made contraction, 'sexto'.

'Ooh la la! Un sexto!' Sexting, or textopornographie, is the act of sending sexually explicit messages and photographs, usually between mobile phones, that has become popular with the rise of portable technology

The decision came among a wave of 
rulings that proposed new French terms for 'prenuptial agreement', 
'happy slapping' and 'child grooming'.

L’Académie française, which is 
France's linguistic watchdog, has been fighting a long war against the 
infiltration of English terms and idioms, advising countrymen to replace such 
words as 'le weekend' with 'le fin de la semaine' and so on.

But
 their latest fightback against the Anglophonic invasion is to coin a new 
term for something you might have expected speakers of the language of 
love to invent in the first place.

Sexting
 is the act of sending sexually explicit messages and photographs, 
usually between mobile phones. The English term, a portmanteau of sex 
and texting, first rose to popularity in the early 21st century.

As
 the spread of technology encouraged the risque practice around the 
world, many languages adopted the word too. But France's authorities 
have now decided to crack down on its usage.

Technology
 has proved a potent Trojan horse for smuggling English words into French, previously spurring authorities to invent new terms 
for email (courriel), software (logiciel) and walkman (baladeur).

Last
 year, they famously ruled that the Twitter-inspired term 'hashtag' be 
replaced with the more elegantly French version 'mot-dièse'

L’Académie
 française was founded in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu, then chief 
minister to King Louis the XIII, as the preeminent authority on matters 
pertaining to the French language.

According
 its founding documents, the role of the Académie is to 'to labour with 
all the care and diligence possible, to give exact rules to our 
language, to render it capable of treating the arts and sciences.'

Its
 40 members, elected for life by other members of the Académie, are 
known as immortels and wear an elaborate Napoleonic uniform of long, 
black coats and black-feathered cocked hats richly embroidered with 
leafy green motifs.

The Académie's General Commission on Terminology and Word Invention made its pronouncement on sexting in a communique published on December 5.

Other English words and terms given a Gallic reinterpretation included 'child pornography', which is now 'pédopornographie'; 'child grooming', which became 'pédopiégeage'; 'happy slapping', which was given the more appropriate-sounding description 'vidéoagression'; and 'prenuptial agreement' is now 'accord prénuptial'.

The French Government commissioned a report into English usage three years ago, which warned that the global domination of Anglo-Saxon culture had plunged the future of the French language into a 'deep crisis'.

The report said: 'English-speakers have a vision of the so-called English-speaking world, but an equivalent concept does not seem to exist in France.

'Despite having 200million French-speakers on Earth, the idea of a French-speaking world is becoming obsolete.

'France is failing to promote its own language, and there seems to be very little interest in doing so.'
