A Rolex watch worth nearly $7,000 bought for former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell by a man seeking government assistance for a business venture was passed Thursday among jurors in the politician's corruption trial.

Businessman Jonnie Williams testified that buying the watch was a mistake, but that he did so at the behest of McDonnell's wife. He also admitted trying to help McDonnell with financial problems while he was in office.

'It was a bad decision on my part to buy that watch when she asked for it,' Williams said. 'I shouldn't have had to buy things like that to get the help I needed.'

The watch was passed to the jury, where each juror briefly inspected it. Williams said he bought the watch at a California jewelry store for between $6,000 and $7,000.

Candid testimony from Williams also included pictures of the former governor behind the wheel of the entrepreneur's Ferrari during a free vacation at his lake house, as well as an admission of loans and an illegal stock transfer he almost made that to ease McDonnell's financial worries after a real estate deal went south.

Williams testified that 
Maureen McDonnell made a comment about admiring his Rolex. He said 
he took it off and handed it to her for a closer look.

'She said, 'I'd really like to get one of these for the governor,' Williams recalled.

He said he asked if she wanted him to buy one and she said, 'Yes, that would be nice.'

 McDonnell gave the watch to her husband as a Christmas present. It is 
engraved 'Robert F. McDonnell, 71st Governor of Virginia.'

The watch is an important piece of evidence because it represents a tangible chunk of the more than $165,000 in secret gifts and loans prosecutors say Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, received from Williams.

Other monetary gifts and loans can't be presented in court for jurors to hold, although many documents and photos have been shown on courtroom video screens.

Photos of Bob McDonnell behind the wheel of the Italian sports car were also shown to the jury during Williams' testimony.

Williams testified that Maureen McDonnell, who also is charged in the 14-count indictment, was admiring the car shortly before the vacation and asked if any like it were available at the lake house. Williams said no.

'She said, 'It would be nice. We never get to do things like this,' Williams said.

He said he then had the car delivered.

Bobby McDonnell, one of the former first 
couple's five children, testified Wednesday that he and his siblings 
goaded their father into driving the Ferrari. Bob McDonnell had not 
driven himself anywhere since becoming governor and the kids thought it 
would be amusing, the 22-year-old son said.

Williams also testified that he and Bob McDonnell discussed a possible secret transfer of Star Scientific stock to the governor so he could borrow money against it to ease money problems he was having with real estate investments.

Williams, formerly the chief executive officer of Star Scientific, said he wanted to keep the deal just between the two of them because he thought it was wrong.

'It could be violating laws. I don't know that. It could be,' he said.

'I didn't want anyone to know I was helping the governor financially with his problems while he was helping my company,' Williams said.

He said that when he told McDonnell he wanted to keep the deal secret, the governor 'said that was fine with him.'

Williams said he ultimately concluded he couldn't transfer the stock without disclosing it to federal regulators. According to prosecutors, Williams ended up making a $50,000 loan instead.

A prosecutor asked Williams if he bought gifts for the McDonnells because they were friends.

'The McDonnells are not my personal friends,' Williams said. 'I thought it was good for my company.'
