Marijuana may feel like a god-given right to Colorado residents following the legalization of recreational pot, but like bottled water, sharp objects or lighters, it's one of the many things that still aren't allowed on planes.

In a show of mercy, the Colorado Springs Airport has installed amnesty boxes where passengers who accidentally bring pot into the airport can surrender it without facing fines of up to $2500 or even possible jail time if caught with the controlled substance.

Like amnesty boxes for other banned items, passengers can drop off the pot before going through security but unfortunately won't be able to get it back as it will be destroyed by the police.

Drop-off: Recreational pot is legal in Colorado now, but still banned in airports. Colorado Springs airport is currently in the process of installing amnesty boxes for passengers to deposit their pot if they accidentally bring it into the airport

While recreational marijuana was made legal in Colorado this year on January 1, it is completely banned in all areas of the airport due to federal aviation regulations which make it illegal to operate a civil aircraft with the knowledge that marijuana is on board.

The Colorado Springs airport officially outlawed pot in the airport on January 10, following Denver International Airport which put up signs warning that the substance was banned before legalization in the new year.

It's unclear whether similar amnesty boxes had been set up at the Denver Airport. MailOnline's calls to the airport were not immediately returned Wednesday morning.

Amnesty boxes for the Colorado Springs airport were being shipped after the prohibition and are expected to be installed sometime today.

Officials are recommending that people leave their marijuana in the car before entering the airport.

New rules: Recreational marijuana was made legal in Colorado on January 1, but it's still not allowed in the airports. Above, a marijuana growing facility gets ready to open before the legalization deadline

The ban applies to all airport entrants, including those with medical marijuana perscriptions and those traveling within the state and to other states where the substance is legal (like Washington).

According to the new law, all Colorado residents over the age of 21 are allowed to purchase up to an ounce of recreational marijuana while out-of-staters can buy a quarter-ounce.

Marijuana bought in the state is not allowed to be transported across state lines, which is another reason the airports have instituted the ban.

Some 136 retail stores have been issued cannabis licenses this year and apparently demand is so high that many have been running out of inventory. Â
