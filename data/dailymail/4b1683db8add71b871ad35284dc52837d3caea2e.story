Mystery spin bowlers have bamboozled English batsmen for years but on Thursday at Lord’s the deception for once will be on the other hand when Sri Lanka will be forced to counter the unorthodox in this summer’s First Test.

Moeen Ali will become the first England spinner with the doosra in his armoury to play Test cricket when he faces the kings of the unconventional and attempts to fill the massive gap left by the retirement of Graeme Swann.

To add to the irony of England being the team with something outside of the ordinary in their ranks for this two-Test Investec series, it is a spinner who has long been their nemesis who provided Moeen’s inspiration.

Saeed Ajmal has been both successful and controversial in equal measure against an England team traditionally suspicious of what can be viewed as a dark art, but he may have done them a huge favour in mentoring Moeen, 26, at Worcestershire.

‘I’ll be ready,’ said Moeen at Lord’s on Tuesday, as he prepared to become one of three Test debutants in the England team, along with opener Sam Robson, 24, and all-rounder Chris Jordan, 25. ‘I know what I need to do as a spinner and I’m sure I can do a good job.’

Swann’s job has been handed, for now at least, to a man who is principally a stylish middle-order batsman but who is adamant he can become a good enough spinner to dispel England’s specialist slow-bowling concerns.

‘I’m not here to try to replace him,’ said Moeen of stepping into Swann’s shoes. ‘I’m here to do exactly what I’ve been doing at Worcester. I’m a  batsman who bowls, at the moment, but I’m more than a part-time bowler and I have the potential to be a top spinner.’

He will try to do it, almost uniquely among Englishmen, by employing the doosra, the off-spinner’s delivery which turns away from the right-hander but which has always raised questions about its legitimacy.

Dual role: Ali says he sees himself primarily as a batsman but can develop into a top quality spinner

Swing bowling all-rounder Gary Gilmour, who tore through England in the semi-final of the first World Cup in 1975, has died at 62. 

He battled health problems for years and complications escalated after a recent fall.

The left-armer took six for 14 against England in the 1975 World Cup semi-final at Headingley.

Gilmour (right) had a liver transplant in 2005 when former captain Ian Chappell and some old team-mates raised money for the surgery.

‘He was at the front of the queue when they were handing out talent, but unfortunately he was right at the back of the queue when they handed out health and good luck,’ said Chappell yesterday.

Former Australia Test cricketer and popular broadcaster Kerry O’Keeffe said in a tweet: ‘Gus Gilmour has passed away... a sad day... had not an enemy in the game.’

Moeen told Sportsmail last month that he was prepared to bowl the wrong ’un this season after working on it at New Road with Ajmal, and now he is ready to unleash it on Sri Lanka after a successful experiment in county cricket.

The visitors, meanwhile, will rely on orthodox slow-left armer Rangana Herath.

‘It’s coming on well and if I have a couple of good days of practice I’ll be ready to bowl it in this match,’ said Moeen, who estimates he has bowled eight doosras in County Championship cricket this season and five or six in each Twenty20 game.

But with Sri Lanka’s Sachithra Senanayake being the latest mystery bowler to be reported for having a suspect action, during the fourth one-day international at Lord’s only last month, is Moeen confident it is legal?

‘The umpires have told me so far they can’t see the difference, so that’s a positive,’ said Moeen.

‘A lot of people have said they think it’s pretty sound and I can bowl it. I can’t wait to get my first wicket with it. Saeed told me once you get one or two wickets with it, you start bowling it a lot more.’

He is quick to praise Worcestershire’s overseas player.

Swann song: Moeen insists he is not going to replace Graeme Swann but can offer something different

‘Saeed has helped me loads,’ said Moeen. ‘He’s pushed me and given me a lot of confidence because it does take a bit of time to master it. You can’t beat the training I do with him.’

Clearly not everyone in the England camp agrees. Only last month, Stuart Broad appeared to question Ajmal’s action on Twitter, forcing the ECB to remind him of his social media responsibilities. Did Saeed have any message for Stuart?

‘No, he was just a little bit upset,’ admitted Moeen. ‘I haven’t spoken to Stuart about it. It’s none of my business. I just let them carry on.’

The wider significance of Moeen’s debut, as he explained to Sportsmail last month, is his determination to be a positive role model for young Muslims who, like him, grew up in inner-city areas with potential problems such as Birmingham.

The beard he wears proudly as a sign of his Islamic faith — ‘the beard that is feared’ as a Worcestershire marketing  slogan has it — should be  an inspirational symbol for British Asians as he walks down the famous pavilion steps at Lord’s.

‘The beard is a label for us to show we are Muslim, just as you would wear a school uniform,’ said Moeen, whose famous cricketing family will all be in attendance at Lord’s.

‘It represents being on your best behaviour all the time. It means a lot to me and to other people too.

‘In terms of trying to inspire other people with faith to play cricket, I am very proud of that.’

He is a significant as well as highly promising England cricketer.
