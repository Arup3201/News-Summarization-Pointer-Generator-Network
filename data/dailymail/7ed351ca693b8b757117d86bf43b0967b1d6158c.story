The parents of a teenager who claimed that she has no rights as an American citizen because her parents never legally registered her, have hit back. 

Alecia Pennington, 19, who was born in Texas, claimed that because she was born at home, she has no birth certificate. She also said that she was taught at home by her mother so has no school records along with no medical records or a social security number.

Her mother, Lisa Pennington, posted a Facebook message on Thursday, which said that although the family would have preferred to handle their issues privately, the level of attention led them to produce a video response to their daughter.

Mr Pennington (pictured left) responded to his 19-year-old daughter Alecia's claims that she has no proof that she is an American citizen by saying in a YouTube clip that he would help her obtain necessary documents

Mrs Pennington wrote: 'We want to say loud and clear that we love our daughter and want her to have everything she wants in life.

'We have offered many times to help her and have continued to offer since the video came out. We have never refused to help. We had no idea what she had been through trying to obtain this information until the video came out. She never told us about any of it.

She added: 'We wish her every happiness.' 

Her father, Mr Pennington echoed these remarks and addressed his daughter directly in a video clip.

He also appeared to confirm that his daughter had no birth certificate or other official documentation by his remarks.

He told Alecia, in a video posted to YouTube, that family wanted 'to help her move on with her life in any way they can'.

The father, who has eight other children, said that he saw on Facebook that Alecia was trying to get her driver's license  but didn't realize 'because you were out trying to do that on your own'.

He said that he had helped her older brother and sister get their driving licenses and it was something he could also do for her.   

'I understand that someone in the family is preparing an affidavit for us to sign and we would be happy to do that,' he continued. 

Mr Pennington said that in order to show she was a permanent legal resident, Alecia would have to obtain a birth certificate or a passport, adding that the latter might be easier.

The father, who is an accountant and an attorney, added: 'Your older siblings have had some similar challenges and I've helped them through all of that.'

'I was home-schooled my entire life, so I had no school records,' Pennington explained. 

'Also, never been to the hospital, so I have no medical records. This leaves me with nothing to prove my identity or citizenship.' 

Should this be true, she would be a victim of identification abuse.

It appeared that Alecia, who is one of nine children, left her home last September, with the help of her grandparents on her mother's side.

Alecia's mother Lisa (left with Alecia and her three sisters) claimed that her daughter is misleading people

Her mother, a popular blogger in the home-schooling community, had earlier posted on her blog,The Pennington Point, that what her daughter was saying was untrue but removed the post. 

Mrs. Pennington also posted a video in response to Alecia's video on YouTube, but later took that down as well. 

Alecia does have older siblings, and it is unclear if they have licenses or any form of identification, though her mother, and now her father, has claimed that they do.

Mrs Pennington also claimed that her daughter does have a birth certificate to the best of her knowledge.

It is also worth noting that after Alecia released this video and started a Help Me Prove It Facebook and Twitter page, her father bought the domain name, making it impossible for her to use.
