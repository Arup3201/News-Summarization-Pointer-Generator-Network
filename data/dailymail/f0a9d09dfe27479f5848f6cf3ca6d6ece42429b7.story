Stephanie Roche may have narrowly missed out on becoming the first woman to win the FIFA award for goal of the year but she did grab the attention of the football's two best players.

The Irish footballer, 25, received more than one million votes for her extraordinary volley for Peamount United in front of 95 fans - but lost out on the Puskas Award to James Rodriquez.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi could not hide their admiration for her as walked past them at last night's ceremony in Zurich.

An extraordinary photograph showed the stars  both looked sheepish  because it was clear they were looking at her figure.

Miss Roche retweeted the picture herself last night with caption: 'Ah lads!' and admitted today she enjoyed the attention.

She also spoke to the Ronaldo after the event and asked him if he was returning to Manchester United, and he would only say 'it is difficult', she said. 

Miss Roche was catapulted on to the world stage after scoring a stunning volley while playing for Peamount United against Wexford in front of a crowd of just 95 people. 

While the fixture was somewhat low-key compared to those played by Real Madrid maestro  Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcelona star Lionel Messi - video footage of Miss Roche's astonishing goal was watched millions of times online.

It also led to a huge campaign for her goal to become the first scored by a woman to win the Puscas Award - with many saying today she was should have done.

Miss Roche was hoping to become the first woman to take home the prestigious Puskas Award for goal of the year at the Ballon d'or ceremony - an annual event honouring the sport's greats.

Despite earning an impressive 33 per cent of the public vote, she came second to Colombia's James Rodriguez, who won for his volley against Uruguay during World Cup 2014 in Brazil.

The talented Miss Roche looked more than comfortable as she posed on the red carpet with boyfriend, Irish footballer Dean Sambra.

While many saw her inclusion as a triumph for female sport, she was vocal about her hope that people would vote for her goal because of skill, not sex.

She told Sky News: 'I am obviously proud as a woman but I am just proud as a footballer to be recognised at this level and for FIFA to see it as a good goal.

'With this goal I had more interest. I came on trial and it worked out. I think the goal kind of helped but I don't think it was the making of it!'

While analysing the goals for the BBC, former Celtic striker John Hartson said about Roche's goal: 'If Wayne Rooney or Ronaldo did that you'd be talking about it for years and years and years.' 

After footage of her volley earned international acclaim, Miss Roche moved on to play professionally for French football club ASPTT Albi.

But after a six month spell, the glamorous sportswoman recently announced she would be leaving the club. 

According to the website of local newspaper Le Tarn Libre, she was 'homesick and had difficulties adapting due to the language barrier.

If her stunning goal and the recent media frenzy surrounding the footballer is anything to go by - although she may have lost the award, Miss Roche is destined for big things.

Her strike, which has been seen more than six million times on YouTube,  saw her control a cross with her back to goal, flick the ball over a defender and then volley it home.

The ceremony saw Cristiano Ronaldo crowned the world's best player for the second straight year, beating Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer to the top prize.

STEPHANIE ROCHE 

PEAMOUNT UNITED vs Wexford Youths (Bus Eireann National League) - 20 October 2013

With her back to goal, Steph Roche collects a pass in her stride before unleashing a menacing left-footed volley on the turn. The fact that the ball didn't touch the ground once from the moment Roche touched it makes the strike all the more magnificent.

JAMES RODRIGUEZ 

COLOMBIA vs Uruguay (World Cup) - 28 June 2014

James Rodriguez was this year's World Cup top scorer and this strike illustrates why. Facing their South American rivals in the last 16, the Colombia playmaker collected team-mate Abel Aguilar's looping header on his chest from 25-yards out. One touch later the ball is in the back of the net as the 23-year-old swiveled and hit a venomous, dipping volley which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE

Spain vs HOLLAND (World Cup) - 13 June 2014

One of the iconic moments from this summer's World Cup as Holland thrashed the holders Spain 5-1 in their opening Group B match. Daley Blind hits a raking 40-yard pass intended for Robin van Persie. Running in between two Spain defenders, the Dutch captain meets the flight of the ball with a breathtaking diving header that looped over Iker Casillas in goal.
