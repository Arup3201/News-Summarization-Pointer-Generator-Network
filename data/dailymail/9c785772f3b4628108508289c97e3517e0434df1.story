A Georgetown University student who died after from meningitis spoke of her death in her final fateful tweet. Several days ago Jaime had a fever of 105 degrees and tweeted: 'This is what dying must feel like'

Andrea Jaime, a sophomore at the School of Nursing and Health Studies, passed away at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital on Tuesday after battling a diagnosed case of meningitis

Students and staff at Georgetown University in Washington DC gathered for a prayer service on Tuesday evening to remember the student.

'This is difficult news for the many members of the Georgetown community who know Andrea,’ read a campus-wide email from Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Vice President for Mission and Ministry Kevin O’Brien.

‘Georgetown officials have been in touch with Andrea's family and will continue to provide support and assistance to them. Please join us in remembering Andrea's family and friends in your thoughts and prayers during this time.’ 

The officials also sought to assure students that everything is being done to ensure their safety against the dangerous and contagious disease.

'As we shared in a message to the community earlier today, proper medical precautions have been taken and members of the campus community do not need to take additional action at this time,' Olson and O’Brien wrote.

Students are still encouraged to contact the Student Health Center if they experience any symptoms, including sudden fever, headache and stiff neck, reports The Hoya.

The exact type and cause of Jaime’s meningitis has yet to be determined. Officials now await test results.

Meningitis can be caused by bacteria, a virus or even an injury, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
