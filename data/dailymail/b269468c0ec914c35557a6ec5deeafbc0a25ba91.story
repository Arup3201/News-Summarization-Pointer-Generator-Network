It wasn't a bad plan but there was just one small, or perhaps that should that be one large, flaw.

This tubby prisoner's audacious bid for freedom ended in total disaster after he got lodged in his escape hole and ended up surrounded by giggling guards leaving two accomplices still trapped inside.

Firefighters in the Brazilian city of Ceres ended up having to be called in to free 16-stone inmate Rafael Valadao when his big belly stopped him making his escape.

Prison guards compounded his embarrassment by standing round laughing as the operation to release him swung into action.

Authorities were last night hunting for a thinner cell-mate who managed to escape first.

Two other inmates waiting behind Valadao also saw their hopes of freedom thwarted by the unexpected hitch in their escape bid.

The four hatched their escape plan at a jail in Ceres in the central Brazilian state of Goias.

Firefighters stepped in around 2am this morning after the two inmates waiting their turn behind Valadao failed in various attempts to push him through the hole they had made with a metal bar.

He was later taken to hospital under police protection with a suspected broken rib.

A police spokesman said: "He was screaming with pain when help arrived.

'He seemed to have underestimated the size of his stomach.'

I give up: In the end the fire brigade had to be called in to cut the prisoner free
