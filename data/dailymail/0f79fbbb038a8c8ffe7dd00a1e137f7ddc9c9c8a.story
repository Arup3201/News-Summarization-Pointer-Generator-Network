Modern mothers are pulling out more stops than ever when it comes to coffee mornings, all in aid of ensuring they are considered the best hostess within the group.

And it seems Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry are at least partially to blame.

As well as teaching us how
to make perfect fondant fancies, The Great British Bake-Off pair hosts have instilled in today's mothers a fiercely competitive 
side when it comes to home entertaining - and 40 per cent of women now say there is competition within their coffee morning circle.

TV shows such as The Great British Bake Off, starring Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry, have made modern coffee mornings more competitive than ever before

Women will now go all-out to impress other mothers when having them round for coffee mornings, splashing out on expensive biscuits, fresh coffee, flowers and even new ornaments to give the impression that they are the ultimate Nigella Lawson-esque domestic goddess.

And as well as cleaning the house from top to bottom for an average of three hours before their party arrives, mothers are
so intent on astonishing their friends with their amazing hosting 
skills that many forbid their children from playing with toys prior to 
event.

Some 36 per cent even ban their children from certain rooms to keep them spotless ahead of their grown-up gathering, and a third buy new clothes 
and make-up in a bid to look well-presented and as though they are in 
complete control of their home life.

Nine out of ten admit they go to an
extra effort to make sure the house is completely spotless, and 52 per 
cent will even shut off certain rooms to their guests if they are too 
messy.

Once the house is 
clean, women will set about laying out flowers, new ornaments, photos and
sometimes seldom-used soft furnishings to give the place a warm and welcoming feel.

'Forty per cent admit there is always 
competition within their circle of friends, and 13 per cent even admit that this has led to a fall out in the circle'

And
66 per cent of mothers will buy freshly cut flowers, 28 per cent will get 
in a new houseplant and 23 per cent will set out the best crockery.

Ground
coffee, herbals teas, fruit juices and fresh fruit are amongst others 
items mothers will fill the cupboards with in preparation for 'mum friends'
coming round.

On
average, women will spend an extra £12.39 on top of their usual weekly 
food bill on food and drink for each coffee morning they host.

Shows such as Come Dine With Me, pictured, and The Great British Bake Off have led to a boom in home entertaining - and we all want to be the best

The
study - commissioned by Philips Saeco - quizzed 2,000 mothers, and revealed that 40 per cent admit there is always 
competition within their circle of friends when it comes to hosting 
coffee mornings.

And 13 per cent even admit that this competitiveness has led to a fall out in the circle.

Deneice Harwi, a spokesperson for Philips Saeco, said: 'With TV shows like the Great British Bake Off, the UK has witnessed a boom in home entertaining and stay at home mums are hosting more coffee mornings than ever before.

'From having the latest kitchen gadgets to the best tasting cake, coffee with friends is now an event where mums feel they have to prove themselves - it's a sign of whether they are coping or not.'

Modern mothers are going to increasingly determined lengths to be viewed as a Nigella Lawson-esque domestic goddess by their peers, according to a new survey. Here are some of the tricks of the coffee morning trade:
