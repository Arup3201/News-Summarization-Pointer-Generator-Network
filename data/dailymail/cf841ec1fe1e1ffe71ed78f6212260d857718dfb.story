A former political activist triggered a furious response yesterday by claiming Tory grandees attended rent boy parties in the 1980s.

Anthony Gilberthorpe alleged he witnessed top Conservatives having sex with boys at cocaine-fuelled romps in private rooms at seaside conferences.

He named four senior figures, all now deceased, among those he says were at the sordid parties. But his allegations were denounced as ‘improbable tittle-tattle’ by former minister David Mellor who accused Mr Gilberthorpe of smearing the dead.

The 52-year-old was an aspiring politician when he attended Tory party conferences, starting in 1978 when he was 17.

He claimed he was ‘manipulated and groomed’ to procure underage rent boys for private sex parties on the orders of senior figures in Margaret Thatcher’s government.

He alleged boys as young as 15 were plied with alcohol and cocaine before they had sex with powerful politicians.

There was also supposedly one man involved who is a current serving MP – but the Sunday Mirror, which published the claims, chose not to identify him.

Former Education Secretary Sir Keith Joseph and ex-local government minister Rhodes Boyson, who both served in Mrs Thatcher’s government, were at parties attended by rent boys, said Mr Gilberthorpe. 

Sir Michael Havers, the former Attorney General, and Dr Alistair Smith – who was the former Tory chairman in Scotland – were also involved, he said.

If true, it would be the first time Lord Havers – whose sister Baroness Butler-Sloss is heading the government’s inquiry into abuse – has been accused of actually being present at such a gathering.

Mr Gilberthorpe says he sent a 40-page dossier to Mrs Thatcher in 1989 detailing who took part in the sex parties, but says he was warned off by a senior civil servant. 

However, his claims were rejected by Mr Mellor. Speaking on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show, he said of the story: ‘The only people who are named are dead ... 

'And so what we are dealing with is here is a lot of tittle-tattle where the libel lawyers allow them to.’

Mr Mellor accused Mr Gilberthorpe of inventing his claims because he was bitter his own political career never took off, saying: ‘He’s come up with these names, improbable names. 

'Rhodes Boyson – I don’t see Rhodes Boyson with little boys. Michael Havers: heaven’s above, an urbane fellow.’

Yesterday Mr Gilberthorpe was not available for comment, but the Sunday Mirror said he stood by his claims. 

Sir Rhodes’s family indicated they did not wish to comment, while Sir Keith’s son-in-law said the allegations were new to the family.
