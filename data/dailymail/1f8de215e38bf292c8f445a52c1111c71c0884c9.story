After spending just 30 minutes at my desk, I'm already rosy-cheeked and glowing. Not from the joy of settling down to get some work done on my latest novel, but because I'm using the very latest fitness import from the U.S. as I type.

Treadmill desks - a small treadmill you plonk under your existing desk, or a table with an inbuilt one - have gone down such a storm with big corporations like Google and Facebook that they are now making their way over here. Set at about 2mph (the pace of a slow walk) they burn up to 150 calories an hour while not distracting you from your work.

Their soaring popularity is thanks to growing research that says sitting down all day is killing us. Just last week a study found that middle-aged women who are inactive for 11 hours a day are 12 per cent more likely to die prematurely and nearly 30 per cent more at risk from heart disease.

Walk while you work: Laura tests out the Office Fitness desk

Sitting affects the body in a number of negative ways. For a start, your calorie-burning rate plunges by a third to around one calorie a minute, and you produce fewer of the enzymes that affect how fat is stored and sugar processed, leading to weight gain. 

High blood pressure, some cancers, diabetes and even depression have all been linked to sedentary lifestyles. And thanks to computers, TVs, laptops and cars, the average person now spends 12 hours a day sitting down. Add seven hours of being horizontal while we sleep, and that leaves very little time for being upright. So could these radical new work stations be the answer?

As a 39-year-old, work-from-home mum who struggles to find time to go to the gym - or even leave the house - I jump at the chance to try the Office Fitness desk (£899). I'm 5ft 4ins and 9st 7lbs so I could do with shifting a few pounds, and sitting leaves me feeling lethargic and bloated.

My enthusiasm dims somewhat after two fiddly, expletive-ridden hours of assembling the thing in my lounge. But once I've stepped on to the treadmill, which stands under a height-adjustable desk in place of a chair, my excitement began to build.

Job training: Standing up for three hours a day, five days a week, will burn 750 extra calories, which over a year equates to running ten marathons

Like mothers the world over, I'm used to juggling several tasks at once, but work and exercise is a new one for me.

With a '3-2-1', the monitor provided a countdown and I was off on a 2 mph stroll. Admittedly that's very slow, but any faster and it would be impossible to tap away on the keyboard at the same time, and I would probably fall off the treadmill from the effort of coordinating brain and legs.

It takes me about 15 minutes to get used to the motion, and each time I lose my balance, I have to hold on to the desk and spend a few minutes correcting my mistakes from hitting the wrong keys. It's a lot like learning to drive - trying to move your feet independently of your hands. There is also the problem of dizziness when you step off the treadmill, but that is short-lived.

However, that night, I slept far better, found it easier to get up in the morning and felt far calmer during the day.

Hard labour

The treadmill was invented in 1818 as a 'human hamster wheel' to punish prisoners

 

By day three, that initial vertigo had been replaced by a feeling of real achievement as I dismounted, knowing I'd woven some exercise into my busy day without much effort or disruption. In fact, I'd walked a total of 15 miles without even realising it.

When you've got the hang of it, you don’t forget you're walking on a treadmill, but it feels totally normal. It's only when a child or husband walks in laughing at the sight of you that you realise you do look a little ridiculous. It's a small price to pay, however, for being able to burn off biscuits tone muscles, improve posture and boost metabolism.

The statistics are impressive: standing up for three hours a day, five days a week, will burn 750 extra calories, which over a year equates to running ten marathons.

Apparently there are benefits to your mind and productivity, too. Working at a standing desk can apparently increase your output by 10 per cent because your mind is more focused when your body is upright. Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin were all advocates, albeit without any treadmill device underneath.

I certainly found my work rate increasing - when I would have taken a break if I'd been sitting at a desk, I felt so caught up in the rhythm of the treadmill that I carried on.

The noisy whirr of the belt slid into the background after a while, and I was able to immerse myself in my writing. But since you're advised to spend no more than two to three hours a day on the treadmill because of the risk of repetitive strain injury, I eventually had to step off.

Our writer soon got the hang of working and walking but the equipment is bulky to keep in a house

My apparatus is just one of the many products exploding on to the market after the American Medical Association recommended businesses offered their employees alternatives to sitting.

Now there are standing and bike desks, Swiss ball chairs and even table-tennis meeting tables. Google is one company in California's Silicon Valley that offers its staff alternatives to seats.

Facebook is another, with design recruiter Greg Hoy telling the Wall Street Journal that workers' energy levels soared when they used standing desks, and his own 3pm energy slump had long gone.

But it's likely we'll have to wait a while for most British bosses to see standing at work as anything other than a gimmick.

The ultimate test is whether I'd I buy one of these gadgets myself. If I was lucky enough to live in a mansion, the answer would be yes, because size is definitely the issue. The desk I tried was super-heavy and 1.8m long. It needs a permanent home, preferably in a spare room-cum-office, and its beech finish won't be to everyone's taste.

But having it in the house does encourage other family members to use it and improve their fitness, too. I even caught my six-year-old son, Paddy, having a go while playing on the iPad. Once the novelty had worn off though, he wasn't at all pleased that his 'football pitch' - otherwise known as the lounge - had disappeared under this unwieldy contraption.

A quick word of advice for anyone taking the plunge - remember to tell anyone who phones you that you're on a treadmill in case they think they've caught you in a marital tryst. And if you're going to drink coffee, invest in a tightly lidded mug.
