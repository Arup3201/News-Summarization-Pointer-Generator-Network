The world's biggest indoor art installation has been unveiled in Germany by the artist who once wrapped the Reichstag in fabric.

The 300ft high 'inflatable envelope', called Big Air Package, is the creation of contemporary artist Christo and is kept upright by fans blowing air into more than 20,000 square metres of translucent white polyester fabric.

Visitors will enter the Gasometer exhibition space, a former natural gas holding tank, through airlocks and walk through the sculpture.

The effect, says Christo, is to leave visitors 'virtually swimming in light'.

The installation by the Bulgarian artist opens to the public today and will on show until December

The project is Christo's first since the death of his wife and collaborater Jeanne-Claude in 2009

Wolfgang Volz, the artist's photographer and project manager, told reporters: 'It feels like being in a heavenly chamber.'

The installation by the Bulgarian-born artist opened to the public today in Oberhausen, Germany, and will remain open until December 30 this year.

Christo, born Christo Javacheff, is best known for wrapping everyday items such as bottles and chairs in sheets or tarpaulin.

Big Air Package is his first project since the death of his wife and collaborator Jeanne-Claude in 2009.

Together, the pair created spectacular public spectacles such as wrapping the German parliament building in Berlin in 100,000 square metres of fireproof polypropylene fabric in 1995.

The display attracted five million visitors to the site after politicians gave permission for the stunt.

The pair exhibited a wall made of 13,000 colored oil barrels at the Gasometer in 1999.

Visitors lay on their backs to take photos of the vast balloon

Christo, 77, told reporters he is trying to finish more of the projects he and his wife Jeanne-Claude had planned before she died
