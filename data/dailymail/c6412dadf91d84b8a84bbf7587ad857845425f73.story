An Adelaide petrol station baron has told a jury he was bullied and assaulted by a police officer when he was pulled over while driving a $500,000 Rolls Royce.

Yasser Shahin, 38, told a jury in South Australia's District Court he was pulled over because the tinted windows on his luxury car were too dark.

The businessman said he felt pain and discomfort when Senior Constable Norman Hoy grabbed his right shoulder and threw him back after stopping him in Grenfell Street in Adelaide's CBD on September 18, 2010.

The Rolls Royce was only 18 months old at the time of the incident but the window tinting was too dark, 9News reported. 

Hoy, 59, has pleaded not guilty to the aggravated assault of Mr Shahin, whose family owns Peregrine Corporation, Shahin Enterprises, BP On the Run, Smokemart and Adelaide's Krispy Kreme.

Giving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Shahin said his wife, mother and baby son were in the car at the time.

He said when he asked why he was pulled over, Hoy replied: 'You don't get to dictate why or when I get to pull you over'.

'I suggested it was a smartarse I was dealing with and the situation escalated, with the officer asking a number of questions followed by demanding possession of the car, asking for the keys,' Mr Shahin said.

Mr Shahin said he opened the door very slightly and leaned in to get the keys from the ignition when he was grabbed by Hoy, who later pushed him in the chest.

Prosecutor Nicholas Healy told the jury Hoy was wearing a personal recording device which captured most of the incident, including a threat Mr Shahin would be 'in all sorts of strife' if he re-entered his Rolls.

Mr Healy suggested the constable exceeded his powers in using force on the businessman.

Under cross-examination from defence lawyer Marie Shaw, QC, Mr Shahin said he felt he had been bullied when he was 'consistently shouted at' by Hoy and his junior colleague.

Ms Shaw asked if he did not heed an instruction to move off the road, telling the colleague: 'You are not a lawyer, I know heaps more about the law than you, so don't tell me where to stand'.

Mr Shahin denied a suggestion he stood close to the policeman's face, but agreed he said something along the lines of being a lawyer and not needing to move off the road.

'I had already experienced a number of inappropriate, perhaps even illegal, instructions and I wanted them to know I knew my rights,' he said.

The trial is continuing.
