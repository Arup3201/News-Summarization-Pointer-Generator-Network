Two of Prince Harry’s most high-ranking personal protection officers watched him being photographed playing ‘strip billiards’ in his Las Vegas hotel suite but failed to take any action, it was confirmed yesterday.

One made only a half-hearted attempt to remonstrate with a group of naked girls – whom the prince had only just met in a casino bar but still recklessly took to his room to cavort with until the early hours.

The unidentified Scotland Yard detective took no further action and even allowed the drunken women to dress and then leave with their camera phones and undeleted snaps.

Rumbled: Now in LA, this is thought to be the moment the prince learned the naked photos of him had been published

He was, claimed one source, ‘enjoying the party more than protecting the Prince from himself’.

Within days the pictures had been sold to a US celebrity gossip website and broadcast around the world, causing intense embarrassment to the Royal Family.

Two of the royal bodyguards are to be quizzed over accusations that they did not do enough to stop the pictures being taken.

Scotland Yard officially refused to comment but Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe is understood to have asked to be personally briefed on the issue.

Today Princess Diana’s former royalty protection officer Ken Wharfe said: 'The moment you invite unknown people into your hotel room there is a question of invasion of privacy and as far as security is concerned it is potentially dangerous.

'If one of these girls had planted drugs or had a knife rather than taken pictures then the officers would be in serious trouble. There should have been better security.

'I always questioned the practice of sending the less experienced protection officers with the younger royals. I think it should be the other way round.'

What happens in Vegas... doesn't stay in Vegas: The party-loving royal was enjoying himself - but it is unclear as to what sort of reaction he will face on his return home

Although millions have already viewed the photographs on the internet – indeed ‘Prince Harry, naked’ is one of the most used phrases on search engines and the images are easy to find – the British media are still prevented from using them after St James’s Palace claimed they were an ‘invasion of the prince’s privacy’.

However The Sun newspaper has decided to publish them after receiving what is believed to be a first-hand account of the night from a girl who was present in the room.

Further details of the prince’s sleazy antics on Friday last week were already emerging yesterday.

The Mail has been told that within minutes of checking into his suite on the 63rd floor of the five-star Wynn Encore Hotel through a private lobby, Harry and two of his friends were out on the town.

The group started their night at the SW Steakhouse before returning via a private lift to their suite to change.

The prince and his protection officers
then made their way to the Wynn’s Surrender nightclub, set around a 
pool and featuring go-go dancers gyrating on stripper poles to the 
sounds of thudding house music.

Mingling with the crowds are dozens of prostitutes, a common sight in Sin City, openly approaching single men.

Harry
and his friends took over a two-storey cabana – an enclosure by the 
pool – closest to the private exit to his suite where they downed 
jaegerbombs  – potent alcoholic drinks.

He stayed chatting to his friends and a group of girls from about 1am until 3.30am on Saturday before returning to the suite.

The Mail was told early yesterday that two of Harry’s taxpayer-funded, round-the-clock police protection officers were with him when the pictures of him naked were taken.

This was later confirmed by website TMZ which broke the story after being sold the pictures.

It said yesterday: ‘The night of the naked Vegas hotel party, Harry was hanging with two male friends...after some boozing, the group decided to bring a bunch of chicks they had just met back to Harry’s VIP suite at Encore.

‘That’s when Harry’s people dropped the ball.

‘When the girls entered the room, we’re told the ladies were NOT asked to surrender their phones...an epic failure considering Harry’s well-documented wild side.

‘As the party fired up, several girls began to snap pics on their cell-phones …and one of Harry’s minders lackadaisically told the women, “awww, come on…no photos”.

‘Sources who were there tell TMZ the minders were asleep at the wheel, enjoying the party more than protecting the Prince from himself.

‘After more boozing, the clothes came off…and more photos were taken, in plain view of the handlers, yet Harry’s people did nothing.’

The website added: ‘TMZ spoke with 
several people in the Las Vegas VIP scene who tell us they see 
situations like this every day and it could have been easily contained, 
but as one source put it, “Harry’s team acted like a bunch of 
amateurs”.’

Hours later at 
least one of Harry’s police protection officers was also photographed 
with him wearing a straw hat and swimming trunks in a Jacuzzi at a 
raucous ‘pool party’ at the nearby MGM Grand hotel.

One British newspaper decided to publish the pictures going against the wishes of the palace

In a statement St James's Palace said: 'Newspapers regulate themselves, so
the publication of the photographs is ultimately a decision for editors
to make'

On
his first full day back in the country after the scandal broke, the 
Queen’s grandson was keeping a low profile yesterday and ordered his 
advisers not to discuss the incident or reveal his whereabouts.

He is still officially on holiday until next week, when he is due to report for duty as an Apache attack helicopter pilot, and has no planned public engagements until an appearance at the Paralympics at the beginning of September.

But well-placed sources have told the Mail that Harry drove to Clarence House, his father’s London base, on Tuesday afternoon shortly after touching down at Heathrow from Los Angeles.

He immediately went in to see his 
Private Secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton. They remained in Mr 
Lowther-Pinkerton’s office for around 45 minutes discussing how to 
handle the fall-out from the pictures.

It
was around this time that instructions were given to Prince Charles’s 
personal lawyers, Harbottle and Lewis who went to the Press Complaints 
Commission to ensure British newspapers could not publish the 
photographs that had already been viewed by millions on the internet.

Sir
Christopher Meyer, who chaired the PCC between 2003 and 2009, said that
it was unclear whether the prince’s privacy had in fact been breached.

He
told The Times: ‘You could argue, “Sure, it’s a private place, it’s his
room”, but if he invites a bunch of strangers to his room, is his 
privacy already violated?’

Meanwhile,
questions were continuing to be asked how the Metropolitan Police could
have allowed the incident to get so out of control.

Moment of realisation? Harry arrived in Los Angeles just an hour after the photos surfaced on the internet and spent much of his time on his mobile phone suggesting that the news had been broken to him

Explaining himself? The young prince was on holiday after an exemplary performance as an Olympics ambassador - but his good work might unravel after the publication of photos of his antics

Metropolitan
Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe has dismissed the furore, saying
of his officers: ‘They are there to protect him for security reasons, 
not regulate his life.’

But
his casual attitude has infuriated Dai Davies, the former head of 
Scotland Yard’s Royalty Protection Squad, who said ‘questions should be 
asked about his judgement’, particularly after the Mail published 
pictures yesterday of one protection officer lounging in a Jacuzzi with 
Harry the following day.

The
former Chief Superintendent acknowledged the Commissioner’s point that 
the prince’s minders were not ‘guardians of his moral compass’.

But
he argued that if Harry unwisely chose to invite a group of girls to 
his room and allowed them to photograph him in a compromising situation,
then it was an issue for the police.

‘We
all love Harry because he is a bit of a maverick but I find it 
incredible, knowing what the prince and his friends are like, there that
there was not a preordained back-up plan,’ he said.

‘If
Harry wanted to pop over to my house for tea now it would have to be 
fully recced in advance and all of those present vetted. We would be 
prevented from taking photographs of him and may even be made to hand 
over our cameras and phones for the duration of his visit.

‘Why should this be so different when he is abroad?

‘From
what we know there seems to have been a fundamental failure to create 
an adequate contingency plan so that when Harry can’t turn off, the 
officers concerned are able to step in with some kind of authority.’

He
added: ‘In my day the Royal Family were guarded by more mature officers
with actual authority. I also introduced tenure which ensured officers 
were in their jobs for only five to seven years to stop people getting 
too close. It reminded them who was paying them to do their job.

‘Protecting
a member of the Royal Family includes guarding their reputation – and 
if he can’t see that as a Commissioner then questions must be asked 
about his judgement. This is a security issue regardless of what the 
Commissioner says.

‘If 
Harry had been in his own private, secure accommodation we would all 
agree that what he does is of no interest of us – but when he picks up a
group of girls he has never met before and takes them back to his room,
then it is a completely different issue.’

A spokesman for the Yard said they would not discuss matters of protection.
