The principal dancer at the Bolshoi Ballet claims he is being framed for an horrifying acid attack on the firm's artistic director.  

Sergei Filin, 42, nearly lost his sight after suffering third-degree burns to his face and neck in the attack three weeks ago after a masked man threw acid in his face outside his home in central Moscow.

Now in an extraordinary twist, the ballet's biggest star Nickolai Tsiskaridze claims managers have been dropping hints he was involved as part of a sinister campaign to oust him from the world-famous dance group.

Real target? Nikolai Tsiskaridze claims that as the Bolshoi's 'most famous' dancer he is at the centre of a Stalin-style witch hunt

Mr Tsiskaridze, 39, believes that as the Boshoi's 'most famous dancer', it is he not Filin who is the real target of a Stalin-style witch hunt.

And despite having a 'cast-iron and concrete alibi', he believes he is the victim of a conspiracy to link him with the attack.

He told the BBC: 'It's like being back in
the days of Joseph Stalin.

'They're organising meetings against me, 
they're trying to force staff to sign letters condemning me - they tried
that last week.

'But all the ballet teachers in the Bolshoi refused to sign it.

'They have decided to use this as an excuse for a witch hunt, to get rid of all the people they don't like. This isn't against Sergei Filin, It's directed against me.'

Mr Tsiskaridze went on to accuse the ballet's general director Anatoly Iksanov of trying to 'settle scores' with him.

He added: He wants to damage my reputation. But my reputation can't be damaged. I was, and, I still am the most famous dancer in the Bolshoi.'

Filin, who is being treated for his injuries at a German Clinic, said he believes the attack was linked to his job as he has received repeated threats.

A Moscow native, he joined the Bolshoi in 1988 and was named its artistic leader in March 2011, after three years in a similar position at another Moscow theatre.

Such is the power and prestige of the post in Russian life that Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, said he believed the attack was a product of envy or rivalry.

Filin had already reported having his car
tyres slashed and his emails hacked, as well as receiving repeated 
nuisance calls from someone who stayed silent when he answered.

The
Bolshoi, which has both ballet and opera troupes, reopened last 
February after a six-year renovation to its landmark colonnaded 
building, close to Red Square in the very centre of Moscow.

As a symbol of Russian 
culture for more than 200 years, it is a big draw for both locals and 
foreign tourists, and has seen power struggles among both dancers and 
directors throughout its history.

Since
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of those conflicts, 
whether driven by egos or artistic convictions, have been played out in 
public.

After the 
tightly controlled three-decade tenure of Yuri Grigorovich ended in 
1995, the Bolshoi Ballet went through five artistic directors before 
Filin's appointment.

He said: 'Someone really doesn't like what I've been doing there. Perhaps they don't like the fact I've been successful.'

Dancers and staff at the Bolshoi, which has become a hotbed of infighting, backstabbing and overinflated egos, have claimed Filin may have even staged the attack himself.

After Filin appeared on Russain Television without a bandage, Tsiskaridze, even went so far as to suggest he might not have been injured at all saying: 'If that really was acid you wouldn't be able to show your face for months.'

In 2003 Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, dismissed ballerina Anastasia Volochkova after reportedly saying she was too heavy for male dancers to lift.

And in 2011, a senior ballet manager resigned after a scandal over sexually explicit photographs.
