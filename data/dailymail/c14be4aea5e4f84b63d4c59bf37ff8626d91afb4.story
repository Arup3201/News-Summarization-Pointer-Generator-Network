A woman who was so overweight that she was told she could die if she didn't change her lifestyle has dropped more than 100lbs thanks to a newfound passion for swimming.

Vivian Stancil, 67, told the Los Angeles Times that she learned to swim at age 50 after being told by a doctor: 'If you don't lose weight, you won't get to your 60th birthday.’

Since then, the retired schoolteacher from Long Beach, California, has won 176 Senior Olympics medals, including a Personal Best Award that Olympic gold-medalist John Naber presented to her in June. 

Great loss: Vivian Stancil, 67, has dropped 12 dress sizes since learning to swim in her 50s

She has also dropped an incredible 12 dress sizes, keeping her doctor’s previous concerns at bay.

Mrs Stancil, who is legally blind, was five feet tall and 319lbs when she received the grim warning about her health, and she could barely walk at the time.

'A bowling ball wouldn't even describe what I was,' she said.

Mrs Stancil, who has been married to her third husband for 34 years, would frequent an all-you-can-eat restaurant  with a group of five girlfriends, nicknamed the Eating Club.

'I'd bring a Ziploc baggie, fill it with fried chicken and eat three or four pieces before bedtime,' she said.

After trying various weight loss methods - including having her jaw wired shut - she turned to exercise.

'You're too fat to run or ride a bike,' a pal told Mrs Stancil. 'What about swimming? After all, fat floats.'

She couldn't swim - and had never even been in a pool - but began taking lessons with Bob Hirschhorn, an instructor who had experience teaching older adults at Silverado Park Pool.

Mrs Stancil, who began to lose her eyesight at 19 due to an inherited condition called retinitis pigmentosa, used sound and memory to navigate the lane lines, noting: 'Being blind helps keep your brain sharp.'

'I typically do 35 freestyle strokes in a 25-meter pool, and you can bet I count every one. Because nothing will ruin your day like bumping your head on the wall,' she said.

Giving back: Mrs Stancil started a foundation to encourage other seniors to participate in athletic activities

As Mrs Stancil continued to practice the crawl, backstroke and butterfly, and adopted a diet of produce, legumes and lean protein, she shrank from a size 24 to a size 12.

She began swimming competitively, placing third in a local Senior Games event in Long Beach, and went on to earn 176 awards at the local and state levels.

She is now qualified to swim in the National Senior Games, and is preparing for the 2015 event in Minneapolis.

'My lifestyle change and this event have energized me,' Mrs Stancil wrote on the website for the Vivian Stancil Olympian Foundation, an organization she founded to help both seniors and young people become more physically active.

'I try to encourage others to do the same and be more active. I sometimes hear people with full sight say "I can’t." I tell them not to say those words to me because you can. Just move! Anything is possible.'
