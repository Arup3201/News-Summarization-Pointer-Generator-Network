Don't let that huggable exterior fool you. Underneath that furry frame their lies a bear with an attitude – just ask poor Mary Anne Forster.

The South Australia woman was out walking her two dogs two weeks ago when they pulled her toward a koala near the bottom of a tree. But instead of nonchalantly ignoring her as is usually the case, this killer koala attacked the two dogs, with Forster getting caught up between them.

People should be wary of koalas especially when walking their dogs

7News Adelaide reported that the koala snapped its jaws on to Forster's left leg and would not let go, causing a bite that required 12 stitches. It was only after she prised her fingers into its mouth that it released its grip.

“Obviously the koala felt very threatened because it attached itself with its mouth, jaws, to my leg and bit very hard, bit very deeply,” she told 7News.

She then hobbled 2km home with her terrified pooches before finally being admitted to hospital. She ended up with a swollen and painful foot, but luckily it did not get infected.

People should keep their distance if they spot a koala out in the wild experts say, especially those walking dogs, as koalas will act aggressively towards them.  

The South Australia woman will be more careful when she walks her dogs in the future
