A first-grade teacher accused of inappropriately touching one of her students has denied the allegation and is using her own prejudice as a defense.

Irene Esther Stokes, 61, was arrested last Thursday and charged with indecency with a child following allegations that she touched the ‘private parts’ of a six-year-old girl student at Northwest Prep Academy in Humble, Texas.

According to court documents, the first grader told her mother that Stokes ordered all the other kids out of the classroom on March 1.

‘The victim said that she was in the classroom alone with the teacher and that the teacher touched her on the outside of her clothes, on what she called her “private part,” her vaginal area,’ Humble Police Department Detective J. Blanchard told KHOU.com.

The girl said when she asked the teacher to stop, she was told to get out of the classroom, according to court records. 

The girl told investigators that Stokes then made her stand out in the hallway outside of the classroom and refused to allow her to eat lunch or take a test.

The child’s mother contacted school officials and was able to confirm that the girl did not eat lunch at school that day.

Stokes has denied the allegations despite reportedly failing a polygraph test.

‘She (said she) doesn’t like to even touch the black children on their hand, she shies away when they try to hug her - she admitted to being prejudice,’ Blanchard said.

Stokes also allegedly told investigators that she ‘doesn’t like the student and has little to no interaction with her,’ according to court records.  

Following an internal investigation at the school, Stokes has lost her job.

‘The employee involved was immediately placed on administrative leave as soon as the complaint was received, and the matter was investigated.  As a result of the Academy’s investigation, the staff member in question has been terminated,” the school said in a statement released Tuesday.

Stokes is scheduled to appear in court on May 21. She was released from jail on a $10,000 bond.
