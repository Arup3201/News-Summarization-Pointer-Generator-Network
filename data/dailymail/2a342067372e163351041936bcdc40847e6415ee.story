In the online world, the ifixit.com site has become well known for ripping apart the latest gadgets as soon as they go on sale and revealing the components inside.

However, with the launch of Apple's iPad mini, the site has excelled itself - ripping one apart before the gadget goes on sale.

The £269 iPad mini goes on sale tomorrow, but the site has already posted a look inside the gadget set to become the must-have this Christmas.

Apple's iPad mini uses a display from South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, one of Apple's major suppliers and also its fiercest rival in the global mobile-device market that the two companies dominate.

Analysts say the Silicon Valley-based iPhone maker is trying to wean itself off its reliance on Samsung, as both giants are embroiled in a bitter international legal battle over mobile patents, for everything from microchips to displays.

In the first dismantling of the iPad mini, which will be sold in 34 countries beginning tomorrow, teardown and gadget-repair specialist company, iFixit, discovered a Samsung display driver chip, which indicated that Apple had picked the Korean firm's screen technology.

Like most producers of mobile hardware, the U.S. company typically employs several suppliers for the same components in its gadgets.

Apple has been known to use screens made by LG Display, for instance.

The iFixit.com site is well known for taking apart gadgets as soon as they are released.

It aims to help third parties find out how easy their new gadget are to repair, and each new gadget is given a 'repairability index'.

In the iPad mini's case, the index was low - meaning few parts can be repaired.

However, the firm did find that the Samsung manufactured screen can be easily repaired.

'Though the markings on the back of the LCD (display) don't turn up much information, the Samsung display driver IC (chip) reveals that Apple, once again, went with Samsung in its display manufacturing,' iFixit said, detailing the teardown on its website.

However, Apple does sometimes uses more than one supplier.

Supplying parts for Apple's iPhones and iPads - some of the industry's most popular and advanced gadgets - is considered a coup for chipmakers and other manufacturers.

The iPad mini also employs SK Hynix Inc flash memory, a Broadcom touch controller, and a number of microchips from Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc, according to iFixit, which acquired one early.

The 7.9-inch iPad mini marks the Apple's first foray into the smaller-tablet segment.

The company hopes to beat back incursions into its home territory - carved out with the original iPad's launch in 2010 - with 7-inch slates that are popular with consumers, even as it safeguards its lead in a larger tablet space that even deep-pocketed rivals like Samsung have found tough to penetrate.

It has won mostly positive reviews focused on its ability to wrap most of the functions of its full-sized iPad sibling into a smaller package, but critics pointed out the higher price tag of the iPad mini and an inferior display relative to those of rival products like Amazon's Kindle Fire HD and Google's Nexus 7.

Online sales have run for a week, but Apple has not disclosed sales numbers so far. Friday's global sales rollout may offer a hint of demand for the gadget, which analysts expect to be strong.

Apple and Samsung are engaged in patent disputes across several countries, and Apple is believed to be seeking ways to rely less on Samsung. But the Asian tech powerhouse remains a key supplier for Apple, manufacturing its application processors and providing other components.

Samsung has stopped supplying displays for Apple's iPhone, and plays a reduced role in the full-sized iPad, according to DisplaySearch. Apple is also buying fewer memory chips from Samsung for the iPhone 5, relying more on Hynix and Elpida Memory.

Many analysts believe Apple will also gradually phase out Samsung as the main producer of the mobile micro-processor and shift business to rival supplier TSMC.

The site gave the iPad mini a repairability score od 2/10
