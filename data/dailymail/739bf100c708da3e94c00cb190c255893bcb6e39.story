A staple in the royal calendar for generations, the Chelsea Flower show has been attended  by countless members of Britain's leading family over the years.

The event, dedicated to celebrating all things floral, has taken place almost every year since 1913 following the success of an 
international horticultural exhibition organised by the Royal 
Horticultural Society (RHS) in 1912.

Held in the beautiful grounds of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, it is an annual event (with the 
exception of some years during the First and Second World Wars) and 
takes place in late May.

As patron of the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), the Queen has attended almost every year since she came to the throne in 1953.

She attends the opening of the show, which begins 
with Press Day on the Monday, and is then given two private views along with RHS 
members. She is often accompanied by other members of the Royal 
Family.

The aim of the exhibitions is to 
celebrate all things floral and encourage amateur gardeners of all standards to try to achieve similar 
displays at home and as a keen gardener the Queen is often seen at her most relaxed as she tours the extravagant displays amongst some of the world's most talented green fingers.

This year marked the centennial of the show and Queen Elizabeth’s presence was particularly poignant as her own grandson was involved.

Prince Harry worked with his charity Sentebale, which hopes its African-inspired garden will highlight its work aids orphans in the impoverished kingdom of Lesotho.

The Queen seemed delighted as her grandson showed her the garden, and her enthusiasm didn’t wane as the she took in the rest of the show, alongside many other members of the royal family.

Miss Blom, who has been working on the design since last August with Harry, said afterwards: 'The Queen liked it. The Prince of Wales would like the plants in the middle to go to the stumpery at Highgrove. The Queen thinks it needs it – it needs some greenery. So we are going to send them down.'

She added: 'She has been coming here (to Chelsea) for nearly 60 years. She said she thought it might be her sixtieth year.'

The Queen used to attend the show often with Princess Margaret (left, in 1981) but clearly enjoys the day which ever members of her family are present

In 1980 Her Majesty opted for playful striped skirt and matching jacket in honour of the occasion

Usually demure and conservative in her style choices, the Queen often chooses to wear unusual headgear to the shows as a pragmatic guard against the windy conditions.

Attending the show for the 48th time last year during her Diamond Jubilee, the 86-year-old opted for a rather different choice of head wear, striking for it's simplicity: a decorated hairnet.

The tulle hair piece was first designed by the Queen's dresser Angela Kelly.

It is made of a fine black netting which kept Her Majesty's hair in place while she wandered the grounds.

Quite unlike the Queen’s usual headgear, it is not clear why she so often chooses to don the netting for the show, but for Chelsea Flower Show aficionados, Elizabeth’s fun fashion has become as much a staple of the show as her infectious smile.

While the current Queen's love for the Royal Horticultural Society's annual event is obvious she is by no means the only member of the family who enjoys the show.

It has become almost a tradition that the female members in particular attend regularly, perhaps stemming from the Queen Mother's Passion for gardening and the show itself.

This year saw Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall attend, along with  the Queen's grand daughters Princesses Beatrice and Zara Phillips, following the long tradition of Royal support of the show.

2013: The affection between the Prince of Wales and his father the Duke of Edinburgh is obvious as they share an air kiss in the Forget-Me-Not Garden

1969: Looking very young in her floral hat, it was strawberry time for  the Queen Mother in the grounds of the Royal Hospital

1950: The Queen Mother wearing a dramatic two-tiered hat and fur stole when touring the show with the King

2000: Princess Margaret didn't let ill health stop her attending the show

1987: Sarah Duchess of York joined her Majesty at the event before her marriage to Prince Andrew ended

It is certainly not something usually seen on the royal head, but for many years now Queen Elizabeth has chosen to wear a decorative hairnet when she attends her beloved flower show.

Opinion varies on why she continually chooses the slightly bizarre covering, but many believe it is to prevent her hair from blowing into her face, as much of the show is held outside in the gardens of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea.

However since it is presumably no more blustery than the countless other outdoor engagements, it seems the choice may be more a nod to the fun horticultural spirit of the day.

Whether adorned with tiny bows or flowers, or topped with a fascinator hat, the Queen's hairnet has delighted and amused for years.
