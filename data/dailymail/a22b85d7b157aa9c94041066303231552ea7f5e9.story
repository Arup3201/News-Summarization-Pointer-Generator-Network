Former Manchester United and Scotland striker Denis Law has opened up about when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

Law, one of the legends of Sir Matt Busby's all-conquering United team of the 1960s, fainted when doctors told him a biopsy revealed the diagnosis.

The only Scottish player to have won the Ballon d'Or, Law explains how he came to know he had cancer to inspire others to seek professional advice if they suspect something is wrong.

'I had a bit of an ache in this area which I had for a wee while,' Law begins, gesturing to his lower abdomen in the Living with Prostate Cancer video.

'But then one day my good lady said: "Why don't you go and see the doctor?"

'We did have a biopsy, which wasn't very pleasant. He (the doctor) came round and said: "Well... you've got cancer."

'I think they thought I'd have a heart attack. As soon as he said it, I said: "Oh, I don't feel well, I don't feel well."

'I obviously conked out. I must have fainted. I was completely out. It's the Law family trait, we don't like hearing bad news ever!'

Law goes on to discuss the surgery in 2003 that treated his prostate cancer with Bryan Cooney in the film, and urges more men to get involved with Movember. 

'It was one of those, you know, there were several things that you could have done,' he adds.  'I'd rather get rid of whatever I've got. Take it all off.

'So guys, if you have any doubt whatsoever, sign up with Movember, try and grow a moustache, and if you do feel any pain, definitely go and see the doctor at once.'

Jonas Gutierrez will return to training with Newcastle next month after his all-clear from testicular cancer.

The 31-year-old revealed that doctors in Argentina have discharged him from hospital.
