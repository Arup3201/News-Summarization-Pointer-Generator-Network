Eating oily fish has long been hailed as a way to keep brains active and cut the risk of a stroke.

But now U.S. scientists beileve eating the fish and nuts might not act as a brain boost after all.

Contrary to previous research, the latest suggests that omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish such as salmon and in nuts, may not halt the decline in brainpower.

Eating oily fish has long been hailed as a way to keep brains active and cut the risk of a stroke. But now U.S. scientists beileve eating the fish and nuts might not act as a brain boost after all

Study author Eric Ammann of the University of Iowa, said: 'There has been a lot of interest in omega-3s as a way to prevent or delay cognitive decline, but unfortunately our study did not find a protective effect in older women.

'In addition, most randomised trials of omega-3 supplements have not found an effect.

'However, we do not recommend that people change their diet based on these results.

Past studies have credited oily fish with the ability to cut post-natal depression, reduce the risk of Altzheimer's disease and diabetes, stroke and arthritis as well as help children perform better in exams and even add two years' to a person's life expectancy.

Contrary to previous research, the latest study suggests that omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish such as salmon and in nuts, may not halt the decline in brainpower

Oily fish such as salmon or mackerel had the most marked effect, reducing the risk by 52 per cent, a study found.

Even eating just one portion of any type of fish each week for 10 years leads to a 29 per cent cut in risk of arthritis, compared with those eating less fish.

Middle-aged and older women are traditionally more at risk of rheumatoid arthritis.

The Swedish study, published in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, involved 32,000 women born between 1914 and 1948.

The study attributed the benefit to the long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (Pufa) content in fish.

Mr Ammann said: 'Researchers continue to study the relationship between omega-3s and the health of the heart, blood vessels and brain.

'We know that fish and nuts can be healthy alternatives to red meat and full-fat dairy products, which are high in saturated fats.'

The study, published in the journal Neurology, involved 2,157 women age 65 to 80 who were enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative clinical trials of hormone therapy.Â 

The women were given annual tests of thinking and memory skills for an average of six years.

Blood tests were taken to measure the amount of omega-3s in the participants' blood before the start of the study.

The
researchers found no difference between the women with high and low 
levels of omega-3s in the blood at the time of the first memory tests.

There was also no difference between the two groups in how fast their thinking skills declined over time.
