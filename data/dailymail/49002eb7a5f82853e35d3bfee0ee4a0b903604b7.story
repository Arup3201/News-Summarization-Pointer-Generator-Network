He was pasty-faced and overweight, with a hacking cough and shabby clothes that smelled of booze, tobacco and worse. Yet Dylan Thomas could get the ladies into bed, all right — even though he wasn’t much good under the covers.

Thomas was as faithful as a randy rabbit, but he wooed women with a shower of sensual, shimmering words that fell on the parched earth of their souls.

The love of his life was as destructive and damaged as he was, and though others tried to save him from himself, the writer was doomed to die at 39, after a (disputed) mammoth drinking session in New York.

Randy rabbit: Dylan Thomas was constantly unfaithful, but wooed women with a shower of sensual, shimmering words

Six decades after his death, Dylan Thomas is creeping back into fashion. But the superb rolling music of his lines isn’t to everybody’s taste; some prefer their poetry crisper, sharper, cooler.

The trouble is that there have been many, many accounts of his shambolic, sponging, drunken life — and the more you read, the harder it is to separate the petulant, self-indulgent, overgrown child from the glorious bard, who is surely one of the most interesting voices of the last century. Hilly Janes paints a largely sympathetic portrait of the poet, which is fitting, since her unique ‘way in’ is through the eyes of her own father, the distinguished painter Fred Janes.

He completed three portraits of his lifelong friend — and these (pictured on the book jacket) give Hilly Janes her loose structure: the ‘three lives’.

What makes this book so readable is the fact that it offers rather more than Dylan Thomas and his insalubrious escapades.

Portrait of a poet: Dylan Thomas by his friend, painter Fred Janes

Janes creates an affectionate group-memoir of a creative set of young Welshman — Thomas, Fred Janes, Vernon Watkins, Mervyn Levy and Dan Jones — who left the land of their fathers to make their way in the world, painting, writing and making music.

There are some lovely stories. When the painter and the poet were sharing a chaotic flat in London, Fred was in charge of the rent, ‘and while Dylan only had a mattress to sleep on, if he didn’t pay his share, Fred, who was much taller and stronger, would pick him up, turn him upside down and shake him till any loose change fell out of his trouser pockets’.

Dylan’s nastier side displayed itself very early. He was used to being molly-coddled by his too-devoted mother Florence and hated having to fend for himself. So he wrote to a Swansea friend ‘complaining about the “little maggots” he was living with and how boring and provincial he found them’.  

Nowhere in her book does Hilly Janes indicate that her father was anything other than a good friend to the often-disgusting Dylan — and, indeed, after the poet’s premature death, Fred was very caring and attentive to Florence.

In 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara, who had been neglected by appalling parents and raped by the artist Augustus John. She was to match Thomas in alcoholism and promiscuity, and expressed her rage and frustration at his dissolute, irresponsible life by physically attacking him.

She was a pretty dreadful mother, by all accounts, and her own children knew the feel of her fists. On the other hand, Hilly Janes comments that it’s hard not to empathise with the hard-pressed woman who said: ‘Had I not gone to the pub with Dylan I would have been left there, sitting like a fool.’

Unlikely lothario: Despite being pasty-faced, overweight and constantly smelling of booze, Thomas (played by Tom Hollander) could get ladies into bed

The author is at pains to remind us of Thomas’s quieter, gentler side, too, and brings us up to date with what happened after his death: the long struggles over his inheritance and what became of children and grandchildren.

Her analysis of his literary legacy is deft, but almost the most delightful thing about this book is its tribute to her talented father, who died in 1999 and was clearly a man of integrity. Which, I’m afraid, nobody could say of Dylan Thomas.

New biography offers a different, gentler aspect to Thomas, but also shows his nastier side
