They had names like Thorfinn Skull-splitter, Erik Bloodaxe and Ragnar Hairy Pants. No wonder the Vikings have a rough and bloody reputation.

A new exhibition at the British Museum strives to make people think again about the Scandinavian pillagers whose name means 'pirate' in Old Norse.

Through their ships, weapons, crafts, words and even skeletons, 'Vikings: Life and Legend' aims to show how Viking energy and ideas redrew the map of the world.

'They were a global phenomenon,' exhibition curator Gareth Williams said of the bearded buccaneers who sailed forth in the 9th century to descend on terrified English monks, Irish villagers and Russian peasants. 'They were raiders and they were traders and they were craftsmen and they were explorers.'

Above all, they were sailors and 
shipbuilders, whose huge longboats, powered by ranks of rowers, took 
them across the ocean as far west as Newfoundland. To the east, they 
sailed down the rivers of Russia to the Black Sea and Central Asia.

The
 Vikings triggered an era of what the exhibition gently calls 'cultural 
interaction' - though it adds that many of those contacts 'bloody and 
violent.'

Historian Michael
 Wood - who will host a live broadcast from the exhibition to 380 
British movie theaters on April 24 - said the Vikings spurred a 
'formative, almost propulsive era' in European history.

'Dynastic politics, culture, language, economies - they changed the landscape,' he said.

Seafaring
 skills take the spotlight in the exhibition, which opens Thursday and 
runs to June 22. It moves to the Martin-Gropius-Bau museum in Berlin in 
September.

The centerpiece 
of the show is the biggest Viking ship ever found. Dug up on the banks 
of a Danish fjord in 1997, it is 37 meters (120 feet) long and had 40 
pairs of oars. Its scale is awe-inspiring even if only 20 percent of the
 ship's timbers remain.

But
 the most spectacular part of the display goes to its enormous range of 
Viking bling, including gold and silver brooches, necklaces and arm 
bands, some of astonishing size. One braided gold necklace on display 
weighs 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds).

There
 is plenty to underscore the Norsemen's bloodthirsty reputation, from 
their enormous swords and axes to the startling skull of a Viking 
warrior, his front teeth filed down and the grooves filled with pigment.

There's stark evidence of 
violence in the 50 headless skeletons of young men found in a mass grave
 on England's south coast - a Viking raiding party that failed.

But
 it also shows the Vikings' sophistication as explorers, diplomats and 
traders who dealt in timber, furs and falcons from Scandinavia; whale 
bone and ivory from the North Atlantic; salt and precious stones from 
the east - as well as in slaves.

Their
 roaming brought in goods from around the world. The exhibition includes
 the Vale of York Hoard, a collection of gold and silver objects from as
 far afield as Ireland, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, found in northern 
England in 2007.

The 
exhibition will puncture some popular Viking myths. They didn't wear 
helmets sprouting wings or horns - that was a Victorian invention. The 
helmets on display are simple metal skullcaps.

The show is the first on Vikings at the Museum in over 30 years, featuring many archaeological finds never seen before in the UK and runs until June

The Vikings were also skilled craftsmen who produced fine metalworking carved with intricate designs which were among the greatest artworks of the early middle ages

The
 Vikings' terrifying image stands in sharp contrast to the way they saw 
themselves: as down-to-earth people who valued honor, friendship and 
good humor above all.

A 
1,000-year-old book called the 'Havamal,' a trove of Viking folk wisdom,
 advises that 'the best thing in life is to be alive and happy' and says
 people should leave nothing behind after death but their good names.

Eventually
 these restless travelers settled down and adopted Christianity, 
establishing kingdoms and dynasties in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. 
Vikings settled in across Europe, populating the island of Iceland and 
becoming progenitors of people including the Rus - from whom we get the 
name Russia - and the Normans in what is now Normandy in northwest 
France.

Their legacy lives 
on in the DNA of millions of Europeans, and in the English language, 
through a hoard of words including berserk - from the Old Norse 
berserker, a ferocious warrior.

Their
 traces are still being found. The exhibition includes the contents of a
 Viking warrior's grave - he was buried alongside his ax and sword, 
inside a boat - unearthed in northern Scotland in 2011.

Viking
 touches persist in the modern world, sometimes in surprising places. On
 millions of smartphones, the ubiquitous symbol for a standard form of 
wireless communication is a rune representing a 10th-century Norse king:
 Harald Bluetooth.
