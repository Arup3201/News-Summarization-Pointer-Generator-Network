Kelly Tilley has been jailed after she burgled a disabled pensioner's home to steal £550 in cash, leaving her baby waiting outside in its pram

A mother went into the home of a disabled pensioner who had previously looked after her children to empty his wallet while she left her baby outside in the street in its pram.

Kelly Tilley snuck into the Stockport home of the 74-year-old after he had left his front door open and stole £550 in cash from his wallet. She then ran away, pushing her child in the pram. 

The pensioner, who has mobility problems, had been saving the money to pay household bills and had previously helped Tilley in the past by lending her money and looking after her children. 

Tilley, of Southport, was jailed for two years as a judge said it was a 'mean offence' in which she had intentionally targeted a disabled old man. 

Liverpool Crown Court heard that Tilley had stolen her way into the man's home at about 2pm on March 31 last year. 

Andrew Sinker, prosecuting, said: 'He went to the toilet and when he came out the defendant was stood in the hallway.

'He said 'what are you doing?' She asked him for a drink and some money. He refused and told her to get out.'

The victim then went into his bedroom and realised his wallet had gone. 

Mr Sinker said: 'He went out to speak to her but she was running off down the road. Due to mobility problems he was unable to chase after her.'

Police searched Tilley's home and found the wallet, with the 31-year-old claiming she had only gone into his home to ask for a loan. 

Tilley, a drug user, then fabricated a claim that he had agreed to lend her cash, but only if she performed a sexual favour for him.

Judge Brian Lewis said: 'The victim had been a friend to you, he had lent you money in the past and he had even looked after your children.

'All of which makes it even more mean that you targeted him. 'When you went through that door you knew perfectly well you were not there to borrow money. You were there to steal.

Kelly Tilley went into the house in Wavell Avenue in Stockport, leaving her baby in a pram outside 

'You knew he was no match for you physically and as you ran down the road pushing your pram, there was no prospect of him being able to catch you.'

Judge Lewis said her unfounded allegation also caused him great distress and the public would be 'outraged' if she was not sent to prison for the offence. 

Tilley pleaded guilty to burglary and admitted breaching bail conditions. She was jailed for two years and 10 months and was given a four-year restraining order preventing her from contacting her victim.

She had numerous previous convictions including theft.
