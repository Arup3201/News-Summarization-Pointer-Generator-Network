I thought it would be a good chance for Roy Hodgson to play James Milner in the deep role in the midfield diamond.

It didn’t work. Milner has been in good form for City and with his defensive quality and work-rate, he deserved a chance.

But he didn’t move the ball quickly enough through the middle.

The diamond should free up Raheem Sterling so you need to get the ball to him fast. 

Milner tended to go sideways when he should have run further with the ball and then tried to find men through the centre. 

He looked more comfortable playing in a wider role in the second half.

Playing a team like San Marino poses a unique problem.

Despite a good show from their goalkeeper, the win was a foregone conclusion. 

But that mentality can affect performances. 

The only way to combat that is to play at pace. 

At times England didn’t do that enough but it did improve in the second half. 

Milner was far more comfortable playing on the flanks

Ox made a difference  

When Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain came on, he gave the England midfield a new dimension.

He wants to play centrally but rarely gets the chance for Arsenal.

When he plays wide it’s as if he has to prove himself whereas through the middle things come naturally to him.

On Thursday night he brought something extra and again showed Roy what he’s capable of.

England fans were delighted Danny Welbeck got on the scoresheet against San Marino

Since his move to Arsenal, Danny Welbeck has enjoyed plenty of support and there was a similar reception at Wembley on Thursday night.

The fans were willing him on and there was a real warmth when he scored. England will be relying on him in future, so it was good to see that.
