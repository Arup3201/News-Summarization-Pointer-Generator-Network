Manchester United face a difficult game at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night in a match Louis van Gaal will be desperate to win.

The Red Devils will be hoping to avoid a surprise second round exit which the Old Trafford-based outfit know all about.

Manchester United were knocked out of the competition in the second round against the then Division Three side York City.

The match - which took place in 1995 - was the last time Manchester United were involved in the second stage of the competition.

Manchester United, managed by Sir Alex Ferguson, lost the two-legged tie against York City 4-3 on aggregate.

Ferguson fielded a strong side containing the likes of Ryan Giggs, Phil Neville and David Beckham - who was wearing the No 8 shirt rather than the iconic 7. 

However they were unable to avoid losing to the league minnows.

Unlucky number? Manchester United legend David Beckham was wearing the No 8 on the day

Caution: A young Beckham was shown a yellow card during the game at Old Trafford
