A city worker has lost half her bodyweight after she hit 21 stone after becoming addicted to eating cheese. 

Hannah Carter, 23, started to put on weight when she got her first job aged 16 and survived on an unhealthy diet of fizzy drinks, crisps, chocolate and ready meals. 

The 5ft 4in brunette, from Sutton, West Sussex, says she would grate a block of cheddar on top of every meal - including pasta takeaways and pizza.

Hannah Carter has lost half her bodyweight after a neighbour asked if she was pregnant. Hannah hit 21st at her heaviest after consuming cheese with every single meal

At her heaviest, Hannah would munch through two 500g slabs of cheese a week, which equates to a 52kg a year - more than 8st

She would munch through two 500g slabs a week, which equates to a 52kg a year - more than eight stone in weight.

Hannah also consumed more than 120 gallons of coke, 728 packets of crisps and seven stone of ice-cream a year at the height of her food addiction.

It wasn't until a neighbour asked if she was pregnant that Hannah decided it was time to make a change.

The account manager has now dropped down to 10st 7lb and shed four dress sizes in just over a year.

Hannah, from Sutton, West Sussex, said: 'I had low self-esteem and I was extremely self-conscious. I got some comments made to me.

'Somebody once asked if I was pregnant. It was just before Christmas and I was walking up to my flat and somebody said congratulations on the baby.

Hannah says she doesn't think she had realised how big she'd become but she swapped cheese and unhealthy snacks for vegetables and nuts and slimmed down to a svelte size 12 

Hannah would buy a pasta carbonara  and then grate more cheese on top, going through two blocks a week

'I had cheese on every single meal. I would have four takeaways a week and I would grate cheese on all of them.

'I would get one of those pasta carbonara meals and then grate more cheese on top. I would say I went through about two blocks a week.

'I said to myself I want to be half of myself and that didn't really become a reality until I got down to about 14st.

'I don't think I had realised how big I had become. It is only looking back now that I know how fat I was.'

Hannah has always refused surgery and said she wants to get the perfect body herself

Hannah says her new lifestyle and figure seems surreal, especially when she buys size 12 clothes

Breakfast: Cereal bar/fry-up and hot chocolate

Lunch: Panini, crisps, coke and chocolate

Dinner: Ready meal with grated cheese and a full garlic bread

Evening snack: Chocolate bar or ice cream  

Breakfast: Porridge and blueberries

Morning snack: Cucumber sticks

Lunch: Turkey breast salad

Afternoon snack: Cashew nuts

Dinner: Grilled chicken, vegetables and rice 

Hannah now snacks on cucumber sticks and cashew nuts after cutting out fatty treats from her diet.

She also now goes on a run every day and has taken up weight training in the gym to rid herself of her saggy skin.

But the glamorous brunette has always refused surgery and said she wants to get the perfect body herself.

Hannah, who lives with her boyfriend, added: 'I have a lot of saggy skin, but I just look at it as evidence of what I have achieved.

'It reminds me of what I do every day. If I wanted to go for surgery then I could have taken the easy way out from the beginning and got a gastric band.

'It seems surreal now to think that I've lost this much weight. To go into a shop and buy a size 12 seems really weird to me.'
