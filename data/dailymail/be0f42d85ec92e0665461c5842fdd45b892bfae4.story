Arsenal have agreed a £3.2million fee with Nice for goalkeeper David Ospina. 

The 25-year-old starred for Colombia during the World Cup and will provide competition for Wojciech Szczesny. Ospina has turned down an offer from Valencia.

Ospina was one of several goalkeepers to impress at the World Cup, helping Colombia to a quarter-final appearance against hosts Brazil.

Arsenal, meanwhile, have made a fresh enquiry for Sporting Lisbon's £35m-rated William Carvalho as they continue their bid to sign a defensive midfielder.

It is believed that his club are holding out for an offer closer to the €45m release clause he has in his current contract.
