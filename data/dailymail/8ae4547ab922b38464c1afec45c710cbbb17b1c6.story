A 'phony' army ranger who was confronted at a Pennsylvania shopping mall on Black Friday  by a decorated Afghanistan vet previously pleaded guilty to impersonating a police officer.

Sean Yetman, 30, was spotted parading around Oxford Valley Mall dressed in camouflage fatigues and wearing military honors that he couldn't possibly have been awarded. 

A YouTube video of a confrontation between him and Ryan Berk, a Purple Heart recipient, who was immediately suspicious of Yetman's mismatched uniform has been watched more than 2.7 million times since it was posted on Friday.

Sean Yetman, the 'phony' army ranger who was confronted at a Pennsylvania shopping mall on Black Friday by a decorated Afghanistan vet, has previously pleased guilty to impersonating a police officer

Court documents show that in May 2003, Yetman pleaded guilty to impersonating a police officer

A Bucks County Court summary shows that in May 2003 he pleaded guilty to impersonating a public servant.

Yetman has refused all offers to speak to the media since the incident, but his fiancée told Army Times that he has ‘spiraled into a deep depression’ since being exposed. Adrienne Lally said Yetman lost his job and has had a nervous breakdown.

‘The phone calls do not stop, and we are now hearing death threats. All of this has us concerned for our children and their safety,’ she wrote via email.

‘He is a good man with a very big heart and this backlash has spiraled him into a deep depression.’

Yetman is facing possible criminal charges after U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks) asked the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia to determine if there was evidence of a federal crime against Yetman.

Under the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, it is illegal for an individual to fraudulently portray him or herself as a recipient of any of several specified military decorations or medals with the intent to obtain money, property or other ‘tangible benefit.’

Berk said he gets 'frustrated' by people pretending to be army vets 'because you serve with good men who have either lost their loves or been seriously wounded who earned that uniform'

Yetman, who insists on the video that he is who he says he is, may have been using the uniform as a means to obtaining military discounts at the mall.

'It’s frustrating, because you serve with good men who have either lost their loves or been seriously wounded who earned that uniform,' Berk told GMA on Wednesday about the incident.

Along with an American flag patch in the wrong spot, Berk noticed that Yetman was wearing three Combat Infantryman Badges (CIBs) on his shoulder – an extremely rare honor.  

The latest incident came to light after Berk approached Yetman on Friday and used his cell phone to record their conversation as he quizzed him about his experiences as a soldier.

When asked where he had received his CIBs, Yetman man first answered that he got all three in Afghanistan - an impossibility since only one is given per campaign.

The conversation got more heated as Berk then called him a phony and accused him of impersonating a soldier.

Yetman claimed he had 'literally just got home from Fort Lewis' and was shopping with his Sergeant Major - who he offered to introduce Berk to.

When the man denied lying about his military service, Berk lost his cool. 

'Here it is, stolen valor at its finest,' he shouted, as Yetman began to walk away. 'Why don’t you just admit you’re a phony?'

‘I noticed his combat infantryman's badge, he had two stars above it, which would indicate that he served in three different wars which is almost physically impossible for his age,’ said Berk. 

There is no U.S. Army Ranger with three CIBs named Yetman listed on any official record.

Ryan Berk, a Afghanistan vet and Purple Heart recipient, was shopping at the mall with his girlfriend and her son when he spotted the 'fake' officer and decided to approach him 

Speaking to Fox on Tuesday, Berk said that while the man had initially provided some answers that could have been correct, his story quickly unraveled when he claimed to have received his three CIBs from service in Afghanistan.

'I served in Afghanistan and have several friend who were seriously wounded and a couple who were killed in action who wore that same uniform and to see someone try and claim that type of sacrifice really irked me,’ said Berk.

He also said his grandfather had served in World War 2 and it was ‘just wrong’ that this man was tainting that legacy by wearing the uniform.

‘No one is going to question a guy in uniform, unless they already wear the uniform,’ Berk, who earned a Purple Heart after he was wounded by shrapnel in 2010 while fighting in Afghanistan, told The Morning Call.

Berk’s video of the confrontation was uploaded to the Stolen Valor YouTube account, where it has since been viewed over two million times.

The account belongs to Guardian of Valor, a network of active and veteran soldiers who seek to expose people who falsely claim military service and/or claim unauthorized medals or tabs. 

On Monday, U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks) asked the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia to determine if there was evidence of a federal crime against Sean Yetman

Anthony Anderson, a vet who runs the Guardian of Valor website told Philly.com that fake soldiers are becoming increasingly common. 

Most are seeking attention and recognition, while others use the uniform to receive exclusive military discounts at stores and restaurants. 

Under the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, it is illegal for an individual to fraudulently portray him or herself as a recipient of any of several specified military decorations or medals with the intent to obtain money, property or other ‘tangible benefit.’

It was unknown if the uniformed man received any special treatment from any store at the mall, but on Monday, U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks) asked the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia to determine if there was evidence of a federal crime against 'Yetman'

Berk has no doubts that the man he confronted was not a ranger.

'He's impersonating in the uniform people died for,' Berk added. 'He was wearing awards that I earned and he didn't.'
