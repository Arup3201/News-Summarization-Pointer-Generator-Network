Cristiano Ronaldo's new zig-zag patterned haircut drew a range of reactions when he unveiled it to the world ahead of Portugal's 2-2 draw with the USA on Wednesday.

But according to a story circulating online it seems his new engraving on the right side of his head is less of a fashion statement and more of a kind gesture towards a young boy in Spain.

Ronaldo paid Erik Ortiz Cruz's entire £50,000 medical fee as he underwent brain surgery recently and the jagged line incorporated into his new haircut is rumoured to be a nod to the youngster's surgery scars.

Respect: The unconfirmed rumour has been making waves among plenty of CR7 fans on Twitter

Young Erik had his surgery in February this year and Ronaldo's design is believed to mirror the marks made in the operation - although the Real Madrid forward has yet to confirm or deny the claims.

However, the Portugal captain very rarely speaks publicly about his charity work and is therefore unlikely to be tweeting to explain his tribute anytime soon.
