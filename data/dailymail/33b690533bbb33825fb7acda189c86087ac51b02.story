Three famous women have agreed to be photographed without make-up for a good cause.

Binky Felstead, Kristina Rihanoff and Apprentice runner up Luisa Zissman have kickstarted a Breast Cancer Care campaign by tweeting pictures of themselves au naturel.

The charity are urging women to dare to bare by going make-up free in return for sponsorship. Participants can get involved for a day, a week, or even the whole month of October - which also happens to be Breast Cancer Awareness month.

Made In Chelsea star Binky Felstead tweeted: Do you dare go to work without make-up?

Binky tweeted: 'Do you dare go to 
work without make-up? I'm going to #DareToBare for BreastCancerCare in 
Oct,' while Luisa posted: 'Can you #DareToBare in October? #nomakeup 
#nofilter.'

Kristina followed suit, tweeting: 'Please RT and help the campaign for Breast Cancer Care- #DareToBare.'

All proceeds from the campaign will go towards helping breast cancer sufferers in the UK. The charity hope the event will become as big as Movember - when men are encouraged to grow a moustache in November to raise money for good causes.

All women have to do is to go to work, a social activity or even on a night out without any make-up on.

Breast cancer is the most common form or cancer with 55,000 women diagnosed each year, and almost 12,000 women die each year.

Andy Harris, director of fundraising and marketing
 at Breast Cancer Care said: 'Every 10 minutes, another woman receives 
the terrifying news that she has breast cancer. It's vital we support 
the millions of women who face the devastating physical and emotional 
impact of living with the disease every day. But we couldn't carry on 
our work without the generosity of the public.'

As well as celebrity support, the campaign also has the backing of one of the UK's biggest online beauty retailers Escentual.com.

Escentual.com beauty editor Emma Leslie said: 'It's a very simple step for any woman to take – just not to put on make-up. It's easy to do but it's a really strong public statement and it's for a fantastic cause.

'It might seem a bit strange that a company such as Escentual.com that sells cosmetics is actually asking women to stop using them for a day or two, or maybe even a whole month, but that's how strongly we feel about this cause and we hope that with #DaretoBare we can really make a difference.'
