The body of married mother who vanished last month has been found in an abandoned house - as her husband is charged with her murder.

Karla Villagra-Garzon's body was found on Tuesday in Chatham Township, New Jersey - 11 miles northwest of her 
home in Elizabeth - after three weeks of extensive searches.

An autopsy determined that she died from asphyxiation with blunt-force trauma, but authorities have not yet revealed any more details about how she died or how she was found.

Killed: The murdered body of Karla Villagra-Garzon, pictured with her two-year-old daughter, has been found in an abandoned New Jersey house after she disappeared on February 23

Loss: An autopsy found that the 32-year-old mother had died from asphyxiation with blunt force trauma

Villagra-Garzon's husband, Abayuba Rivas,
 39, was charged with murder and other offenses - despite putting on an 
emotional front as he appeared in a television interview just days 
earlier.

Villagra-Garzon, 32, disappeared on February 23 and her husband said she had gone to a pharmacy to pick up medicine for her two-year-old daughter but never returned, The Star-Ledger reported.

Surveillance video from Walgreens shows that she never arrived at the store and Rivas reported his wife missing the next morning.

After her disappearance, he spoke to WABC and said that he and his wife had been having marital problems and fought before she went out to collect the prescription.

Arrested: Abayuba Rivas, 39, pictured giving a television interview following his wife's disappearance with her two-year-old daughter, has been arrested in connection with her murder

Interview: He said that he assumed something bad had happened to her because of her lack of contact

'She was angry, many times, she had a bad attitude,' Rivas said.

He added that he did not have hope of finding her.

'It's not something good, because almost 10 days out of the house,' he said.

He was taken into custody more than a week ago on other charges, including endangering a child - for allegedly leaving Villagra-Garzonâ€™s daughter home alone - and lying to police, authorities said.

Neighbors told NBC4 they had always been suspicious of Rivas' story that his wife had never returned.

Loved: Authorities do not know when the mother-of-one's body was left at the abandoned house

Scene: She was found at this Chatham Township house, 11 miles from her family's home, on Tuesday

Hidden: The empty house, pictured, is run down and isolated and hidden by trees on all sides

'They've got two cars. How's she going to walk away that late at night?' said neighbor Diana Giraldo.

It is not clear if the little girl, who appeared on WABC with Rivas, is his daughter too.

Authorities said it is not yet clear how long Villagra-Garzon's body had been at the home, which is vacant, rundown and isolated by forest on all sides.

Investigators have not said what led them to the house.

Rivas is being held on $2 million bail.
