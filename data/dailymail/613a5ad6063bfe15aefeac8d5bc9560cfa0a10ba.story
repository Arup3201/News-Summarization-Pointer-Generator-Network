In a sales pitch gone wrong, a pilot salesman was lucky to escape uninjured alongside his two passengers after the aircraft he was flying crashed into a backyard.

The pilot, 62-year-old Peter Edwards according to the Daily Telegraph, was demonstrating how the Cirrus SR22 aircraft he was flying could recover from a stall on May 10 when he lost control of the plane, according to a report of the incident released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.

'Watch this,' Mr Edwards was reported to have said shortly before the plane's right wing dropped rapidly, sending the aircraft into a spin.

After the planes third rotational spin, it became clear that the pilot would not be able to regain control from the maneuver.

The passenger in the front seat of the aircraft claimed it was at this point that Mr Edwards clearly stated 'I'm sorry'.

About 2,000 feet above the ground, the pilot released the aircraft's parachute. Narrowly avoiding some nearby power lines, the plane collided with the branches of a tree before crashing down onto a resident's fence.

The plane landed in the front yard of Blue Mountains property belonging to Sheila Riordan who appeared more concerned that her nap had been interrupted in an interview with the Blue Mountains Gazette.

The 66-year-old told the publication that she heard loud bangs but didn't think anything of it, saying that her first thought was 'there's no peace'.

'When I first saw it I thought "that's a surprise". But I really am glad that no-one got hurt. It could have been awful, the bush could have gone up, people could have got hurt. It’s the only place they could have landed neatly,' Ms Riordan said.

The passenger in the front seat claimed that once the plane had come to its resting position, he had to shake the pilot who he described as appearing 'dazed', urging him to 'hurry up and open the door and exit the aircraft'.

He claims he was also forced to switch the ignition and master switches and fuel selector off, as the pilot had previously failed to do so.

The report stated that Mr Edwards claimed he had performed the same manoeuvre earlier that day with no problems, however he admitted that 'he was probably overconfident as he had done the demonstration 30-50 times in the previous six months'.
