A bereaved father was yesterday convicted of a road rage attack but spared jail after a judge hailed his ‘extraordinary’ role in defusing the summer riots.

Tariq Jahan, 46, was praised by both the police and Prime Minister David Cameron over his call for an end to the violence just hours after the murder of his son.

The delivery driver faced a maximum sentence of five years in jail after being convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm on factory worker Sajjad Ali.

The court heard he had punched Mr Ali
to the ground – breaking his jaw in two places – a month before his 
son, Haroon, 21, and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, 
died at the height of the August violence. They were run down by a car 
in Winson Green, Birmingham.

Judge William Davis QC said: ‘People who break people’s jaws in this kind of mindless violence normally go to prison.’

But he told Jahan: ‘You suffered the 
loss of one of your sons, which was desperate in itself. But more 
particularly, in the aftermath of this loss you took steps which 
probably prevented really serious disorder continuing in Birmingham.’ 
The judge described Jahan’s actions as ‘a genuine  public service’.

Jahan’s 12-month prison sentence was 
suspended for two years. He was handed 100 hours  of unpaid work and 
told to pay  Mr Ali £1,000 compensation.

The court had heard how Tariq Jahan, 46, grabbed 34-year-old Sajjid Ali by the 
throat before punching him to the ground after the pair got into an 
argument in Handsworth, Birmingham, on July 6 last year.

He had accused the factory worker of staring at his wife.

The judge said he had sentenced 
many people for riot-related crimes since last summer and Jahan was cleared of the more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Yesterday, Jahan sobbed and held his head 
in his hands as he gave evidence to the jury at Birmingham Crown Court.

His 21-year-old son Haroon died as 
riots swept across the country last August and Jahan admitted hitting Mr Ali in 
the face but told the court he acted in self defence after Mr Ali head-butted him, and denies the charge against him.

He said he pulled over and got out of 
his car to speak to Mr Ali after the pair got into an argument over 
Jahan sounding his car horn at a van blocking his path. Mr Ali had been 
standing on the roadside speaking to the driver of the van.

Jahan told the court Mr Ali was mouthing something at him in an 'aggressive manner'.

He said he wound down the window on 
the passenger side of his white Mitsubishi car and asked Mr Ali about 
where he was from and what his religion was in an attempt to relate to 
him and find some common ground.

He said: 'I asked, "are you Pakistani,
Iraqi, Sikh, Hindu or Muslim", just to try to relate to him. He looked 
very similar to me and I suspected he was of Asian descent and because 
he was a young man and he looked a bit upset I was trying to calm him 
down.

'I thought if I could relate to what he was, I could talk to him better.

'He replied, "F*** off you grey haired old fart, what has it got to do with you?"

'I parked the vehicle. My wife (in the passenger seat) said to me, ‘what are you doing?', I said, ‘I'm going to talk to him.'

'I normally speak to people who are aggressive.'

Jahan said he was 'upset' when the 
incident became violent, adding: 'I didn't want confrontation, I just 
wanted to try to resolve something that I thought I could resolve. I 
wasn't proud of what I had done. I was not happy.

'To see what I had done played on my mind as I drove back home. To me, it was the only means of defending myself.

'I was hoping to calm him down. He was a young man and he seemed to be getting aggressive over a minute issue.'

Asked why he did not just drive away, 
he said: 'It is not in my nature to drive off. You try to resolve 
issues, you don't run away from issues.

'I thought if I talked to him I could 
calm him down. I suppose now with hindsight I could have, I should have,
driven off. It probably wouldn't have got to this stage.

'If human beings can relate to one another, they tend to calm down.'

Jahan's son Haroon and his friends - 
brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31 - were struck by a car in
the early hours of August 10 last year during disorder in the Winson 
Green area of Birmingham.

They were pronounced dead in hospital and hailed as heroes who died protecting homes and shops from looters.

Jahan, of Winson Street, Winson Green,
later made a heartfelt plea to crowds of youths gathered outside his 
home to end the disorder and 'go home'.

His personal call for calm was credited with helping to bring an end to the riots.

Asked about his actions in the hours 
following his son's death by defence barrister Ali Naseem Bajwa, QC, he 
said: 'There is hardly any issue in life that can't be resolved by 
talking to someone.'

Sobbing, he added: 'I had my own loss 
at the time and I felt that it was not necessary for other people to 
suffer what I had suffered.'

Jahan subsequently received a Pride of
Britain special recognition award for his compassion and dignity in the
aftermath of his son's death.

Giving evidence to the court 
yesterday, Mr Ali said Jahan drove up to him in his car and said: 'Oi, 
why you staring at me?' before getting out of the vehicle and accusing 
him of 'staring at my missus'.

Mr Ali, 34, alleges he was grabbed by 
the throat by the defendant, punched in the face and knocked to the 
floor, then kicked or punched while he was on the ground.

Mr Ali told the jury of five women and
seven men Jahan's manner was 'really aggressive' when he approached him
and accused him of staring.

'He punched me and it was on my 
forehead or somewhere,' he told the court, 'but I was totally blind. It 
went in one of my eyes and I just fell down.'

He said he thought the attack lasted 
five minutes or less but he did not know if a number of blows he 
received while he was on the floor were kicks or punches and said: 'It 
was just bang, bang, bang on my head.'

He went on: 'He punched me or kicked 
me, I can't say exactly if it was a punch or kick, but when he saw me 
spitting my tooth and my mouth was bleeding he just ran off.

'He left me like that.'

Mr Ali was taken to hospital by his 
manager and treated for two fractures to his jaw. He also lost two teeth
and had bruises to the left temple area of his face.

Prosecutor Shenaz Muzaffer told the 
court a medical expert concluded that a 'moderate to severe' use of 
force would have been required to cause the injuries to the jaw.

She said: 'It is the Crown's case that the defendant deliberately inflicted those injuries intending to cause serious harm.'

She added: 'The defendant does accept that he did have an altercation with Mr Ali but says he was acting in self defence.'
