She may have been half her opponent's size, but that didn't stop this mini breakdancer from showcasing a fiery range of moves.

The pint-sized performer was taking part in the Baby Battle division of the 
Chelles Battle Pro competition held in an Eastern suburb of Paris, 
France on Saturday.

Kitted out in a mini grey tracksuit with pink stripes, Terra from Wolverhampton, performed an impressive array of moves.

Setting the crowd on fire: Six-year old-Terra performs dance moves even her much older competitor can't handle yet

Special award: Terra won Best Dancer of the Baby Battle in the division of the Chelles Battle Pro competition held in an Eastern suburb of Paris, France on Saturday

Crew: Terra is part of Soul Mavericks - a London B-Boy dance crew

Dizzy: She slid across the floor, twisting and spinning in a way that would make most six-year-old's dizzy

At the start of the battle Terra's opponent dances on the stage and showcases his moves to a animated audience.

Watching from the edge Terra then moves in and starts her set including headstands and handstands, her head protected from spins by a black hat.

After her opponent took centre stage again, Terra ramps up her performance and it's clear the crowd are behind her as she flips three times while launching into another energetic routine.

She slid across the floor, twisting and spinning in a way that would make most six-year-old's dizzy.

Decisions: The judging panel sat along the side of the stage

The tiny dancer looked like she was 
thoroughly enjoying the attention and even made it seem like she had moved 
away from choreography and was free-styling.

At the end she went over and offered a
 high-five to a supporter at the side of the stage as well as going back
 into the middle and high-fiving her opponent

Although a dancer called Jalen won the overall Baby Battle - Terra won Best Dancer.
