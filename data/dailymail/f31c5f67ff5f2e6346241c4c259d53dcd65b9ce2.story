A woman found her Asda cooked chicken had an unwanted dressing when she got it home and found a blue plaster stuck to it.

Marie Doyle, 24, bought the ready-cooked bird from the supermarket's branch in Sittingbourne, Kent, for Sunday lunch for her family.

But she removed it from its sealed bag and found the plaster stuck to the underside of the bird.

The bird in question: Marie Doyle found a very unwelcome addition stuck to a ready-cooked chicken she bought from Asda - a blue first-aid plaster

Asda offered Marie a refund and a £50 gift voucher but she has rejected it and demanded a full investigation.

Coffee-house worker Ms Doyle, from Parkwood, Kent, said: 'I was at home with my mum Andrea so I took it in to show her and we were both almost physically sick.

For Sunday lunch: Ms Doyle showed her mother Andrea (pictured together) and they 'were both almost physically sick'. She refused a £50 gift voucher and demands a full investigation into how the plaster got there

Ms Doyle: 'It wasn't about the money, it was about making sure it didn't happen to anyone else'

'We spoke to the manager of the rotisserie section and he offered us a refund, another chicken and a £10 voucher.

'We took the refund, but we definitely didn't want another chicken.

'They increased the voucher to £50 but we didn't accept that either as we said we wanted an investigation into how the plaster got there.

'It wasn't about the money, it was about making sure it didn't happen to anyone else.'

An Asda spokesman yesterday said staff have had health and safety briefings since the discovery.

He said: 'We're sorry Miss Doyle didn't have a good experience with us this time.

'It certainly doesn't meet the high standards we set ourselves.

'We do take this very seriously and have taken the necessary measure to make sure this doesn't happen again.'
