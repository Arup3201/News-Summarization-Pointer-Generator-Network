A British businessman has been charged with killing his wife after she was beaten and strangled in the Caribbean.

Alexander Clack, 32, originally from London, is accused of murdering his wife Nixiann Downes-Clack after her body was found in a shallow grave in Grenada on Friday, four days after she was reported missing by relatives on the island.

The 27-year-old died of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation by strangulation, according to a post-mortem examination.

Nixiann Downes-Clack's body was found in a shallow grave in Grenada on Friday, four days after she was reported missing by relatives on the island

Charged: Alexander Clack, accused of murdering his wife in Grenada and then stuffing her into a suitcase

Clack is in custody on a charge of non-capital murder, meaning the death penalty cannot be considered if there is a conviction.

It was not immediately clear if she was also a British citizen.

The 27-year-old woman was 'suspected to have been the victim of domestic abuse and gender violence,' said Delma Thomas, Grenada's minister of social development, housing and gender affairs. 

Police said Clack led investigators to his wife's remains in Mt. Moritz, a village just north of the capital, St. George's.

Local 
television station CC6 reported that Mrs Clack was reported missing on 
Tuesday after she failed to show up at her mother's house to pick up her
 daughter.

They
 said the body was found near a house that belonged to a teenager that 
Clack is alleged to have been in relationship with - a teenage girl 
detained with Clack on Friday has since been released from police 
custody.

On Thursday Clack confessed to the 
killing and he said her body was placed in a suitcase before being 
buried in a shallow grave which measures 3 feet by 6 inches wide and 3 
feet 8 inches in length.

Clack apparently put his wife's body in a suitcase before transferring it to the shallow grave

Police found her body in this grave - the land allegedly belonged to the family of a teenager that Mr Clack was in a relationship with

The house where the body was found. Police said Clack led investigators to his wife's remains in Mt. Moritz, a village just north of the capital, St. George's

The couple apparently had a two-year-old daughter and had been married for six years.

Anselm Clouden, Clack's lawyer, did not respond to an email seeking comment about his client's court hearing Monday.

Clouden's office phone rang unanswered.

Clack was born and raised in London but lives in Grenada, a small country in the eastern Caribbean.

He is the owner of SGU Fish Market, a company that delivers fish to hoteliers, supermarkets and retailers. 

He is also listed as an Operations Supervisor in (Grenada) - his bio states he 'worked for several years with the prison service in north London. Mr. Clack is also a competent dog handler and dog trainer.'
