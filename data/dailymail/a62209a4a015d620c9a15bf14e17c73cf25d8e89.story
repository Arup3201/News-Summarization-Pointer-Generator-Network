Xabi Alonso has disrespected his former Real Madrid team-mates Cristiano Ronaldo and Iker Casillas after backing Manuel Neuer to win the Ballon d'Or, according to reports in Spain.

That's the view of newspaper Marca, who claim that Alonso has shown bitterness after leaving the La Liga side for Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich last summer.

Alonso told German publication Bild on Wednesday: 'If Manuel won it, it'd be totally deserved. Neuer is by far the best keeper I've played with and is also outstanding outfield.'

Those words have not gone done well in Alonso's home country, with Marca accusing the former Liverpool midfielder of showing disrespect to Ballon d'Or holder and favourite Ronaldo and Spain international goalkeeper Casillas.

Elsewhere in Spain and AS focus on a potential name change at Real's Bernabeu stadium.

The newspaper claim that the ground could soon become either the IPIC Bernabeu or Cespa Bernabeu after president Florentino Perez let the news slip.

An AS survey has also shown that 66 per cent of Los Blancos fans are against the name change, despite the extra revenue it would bring in.

Mundo Deportivo have an interview with Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic, who admits he wants to win 'everything' with Luis Enrique's side.

The former Sevilla man also insists that Barca's players are behind Enrique despite rumours of discontent among the squad. 

Over in Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport have an interview with Juventus manager Massmiliano Allegri, who admits he wants to win Serie A and take the club into at least the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

The Italian also claims that former Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata, who Juve signed last summer, can become one of the best players in the world.
