Make-up artist Jordan James Parke loves Kim Kardashian so much he's shelled out £100,000 on procedures to look like her.

He copies her beauty regime, her make-up and even has clothes made that are inspired by her outfits.

Now the British superfan, 23, is taking his transformation even further - he's having implants to get a bottom as large as the reality star's.

Jordan James Peele has spent £100,000 to look like his inspiration, reality star Kim Kardashian 

Jordan's idol Kim Kardashian shared the front cover of her new book of selfies, Selfish, published by Rizzoli

It takes him two hours to copy Kim's make-up every day, evening using drops to mimic her bright eyes 

Jordan has had lip fillers to copy Kim's glossy pout, cheek and chin fillers to define his jawline and approximate her bone structure and he's had thick, exaggerated brows tattooed on his face.

Appearing on This Morning on ITV today, he said: 'I love Kim, I love her so much. I've always admired strong women. 

'I was brought up by my mum and my nan so I've always admired strong women.'

Jordan, who began his Kardashian transformation four years ago said he's similarly infatuated with Mariah Carey and Katie Price but Kim is his top idol.

Along with the injectables, he's had his eyebrows tattooed, micro-dermabrasion and regular 'vampire' treatments, in which is blood is extracted from his arm and injected in his face to help rejuvenate his skin - a facial Kim underwent on her show.

He said: 'As soon as I saw Kim get it done on Keeping Up With The Kardashians I was just like, oh my God, I need to try that, I need to get it done.'

But Jordan's body transformation is far from complete. He's about to boost his bottom to the same size as the curvaceous beauty. 

'I love her bum, her bum's amazing. When she did the cover when the bum was out, I think she looked amazing, she's an inspiration.

'I'd like to go as big as her. I'm not going to get implants, I won't go down the route of implants. 

'I've been looking at body contouring, it's quite big in America. 

'I want to get liposuction on my stomach and back. I lost 70lb last year, I'm so lazy, I never exercise so I want to get lipo on my stomach and back and they put the fat back into your bum so you get two procedures in one and you get a big bum.'

Jordan was inspired to have the gory-looking treatment after seeing Kim have the facial on TV in 2013

But there are downsides to looking like Kim, including having such swollen lips that they've lost feeling.

But he's also hurt by nasty comments from internet trolls criticising his behaviour.

He said: 'I've always worked, I've worked since I was 13. I'm a make-up artist and I work in a health club as well. 

'I've  had boyfriends in the past who've funded my lifestyle and they've paid for things. I've come from a hard-working family. 

Jordan, whose top lip can sometimes feel numb, has also had Mariah Carey's name tattooed on his arm

'Kim's lips are big, they're obviously not as big as mine,' he added, before explaining that he uses eye-drops every day to mimic her bright eyes.

Jordan has tattooed both arms, as well as his eyebrows and won't rest until he has Kim's big bottom

'I saw hate online, but I've never taken any money off the NHS, I've never been on benefits. I do loads for charity - they don't know what I donate for charity.'

And to critics who think his obsession with changing his appearance can only stem from low self-esteem he said: 'I'm extremely confident. I love the way I look. 

'People  don't understand how you can look different and be confident.'

But what would Kim think about his efforts? 'I think she'd be like, "good for him whatever he wants to do".' he said. 

He spends two hours every day copying Kim's sculpting and shadowing contouring make-up techniques

Jordan says Kanye West's influence means that Kim's outfits, which he copies, are always 'amazing'
