The mother of a 17-year-old New South Wales girl who is fighting for life in hospital after a devastating hit-and-run said her family is doing it 'very tough' as police hunt for the alleged offender.

April-Lee Gillen, from Berkeley on the state's south coast, was admitted to hospital in a critical condition early on Sunday morning after suffering 'extensive head injuries' a police statement said.Â 

In what could be a chilling clue for investigators, she is believed to have posted the following status to her Facebook account shortly before the incident.

Chilling: The teenager posted this potential clue minutes before she was found in a critical condition

'Phones on 1 percent walking from warrawong to berks (Berkeley) and some Asian guy just stopped me telling me to come home with him cause it's safe and I need help wtf sos'.

A screenshot of the cyber SOS was posted by Casey Louise, a friend of April-Lee's late on Monday night.

April-Lee's mother Leonie told MailOnline she has not been able to bring herself to look at her daughter's Facebook account as her relatives maintain a bedside vigil at Wollongong hospital.

'I'm just trying to concentrate on April, I've just popped out to have a shower and then I'll be back,' she said from the family home.

'I'm just trying to keep my energy levels up, it's very tough.'

Asked how her daughter was faring in the critical 48 hours since the incident, Mrs Gillen said: 'nothing's changed'.

According to police, a number of residents near Northcliffe Drive in Lake Heights - where April-Lee was hit - heard a 'loud noise' shortly before the critically injured teenager was found bloodied on the side of the road.

Initial investigations suggested she was the victim of a hit and run.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald, April's sister Kimberly wrote on Facebook: '(April is) in ICU on life support bleeding from her brain and not breathing on her own.

'She may of been abused or a hit and run between 12.30 and 1.30.'

This afternoon, Kimberly wrote: 'I would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers regarding April-Lee. I have been overwhelmed with inbox's and messages of support. I have been extremely busy and haven't had time to reply but I do appreciate it. Thankyou from the entire Gillen family, we are staying positive.'

NSW police have urged anybody with information to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

Early this afternoon NSW police released another statement, announcing strike force Ketic had been set up to investigate the incident.

In the statement, police appealed for any witnesses who saw April around 1am on Sunday to come forward.

'April is described as being of Caucasian appearance, with long dark hair and an average build. When found she was wearing a light-coloured pair of cargo pants, black shirt or blouse, khaki jacket and brown sandals, and she was carrying a black handbag,' police said.

This morning Lake Illawarra inspector Steve Worthington told reporters: '(The Facebook message) is certainly vital information our detectives are following up, but until we can speak to April herself, we need further information from the public.'
