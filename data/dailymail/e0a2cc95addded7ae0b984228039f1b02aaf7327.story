A 911 dispatcher who was suspended for using her cell phone during an emergency call while the victim lay dying has now been arrested for holding a loaded gun to a reporter's head.

Shauna Justice, 28, was taken into custody by police in Volusia County, Florida, on Tuesday after pulling a gun on television journalist Claire Metz, who had gone to the communication center operator's house requesting an interview after she hit national headlines this week.

Office camera footage had shown Justice using her personal cell phone as a trainee under her direction directed first responders to the wrong location for a 911 call.

The victim, Bob Hill, 58, died of a heart attack while waiting for an ambulance during the mishap.

Scene: This is the New Smyrna Beach home of 911 dispatcher Shauna Justice that television journalist Claire Metz went to ask for an interview. While at the door Justice is alleged to have pulled a gun on Metz

Armed and ready: Shauna Justice allegedly pulled a 9mm handgun, like this one, on TV reporter Claire Metz. It was loaded with 11 bullets, however none were in the chamber, police said. She was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and held on a $1,500 bond

An internal investigation decided Justice would be suspended without pay for three days, pending any further disciplinary decisions.

According to local police, Justice yelled at Metz - a long-time journalist for WESH-TV who didn't have a microphone or camera in hand - to get off her property in Jungle Rd, New Smyrna Beach, at about 12.30pm on Tuesday.

'When Justice answered the knock, she pointed a gun at the reporter's head through the exterior storm door and yelled at the reporter to get off of her property,' a statement from the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said.

Metz quickly backed away, telling Justice to calm down, she told KSN.

Justice then walked out the door and continued to point the gun at the reporter, only dropping her arm down to her side when the reporter returned to her news van,' the statement said.

The WESH-TV cameraman waiting in the van took a picture of Justice after she had lowered the gun.Â

911 dispatcher Shauna Justice was said to be 'very remorseful' about using her cell phone on duty, however she then pulled a gun on a reporter following the incident

Justice told deputies she thought she was justified in using a weapon because she 'felt harassed to the point where she felt threatened'.

Deceased: Bob Hill, 58, died of a heart attack while waiting for paramedics to arrive

However officials determined she was not justified, charging her aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

She was released from the Volusia County Branch Jail later Tuesday after posting $1,500 bail.

Deputies seized a loaded 9mm semi-automatic handgun from Justice's home.

The gun was loaded with 11 bullets but had none in the chamber, officials said.

Metz said she was 'stunned' by the encounter.

'The gun was no more than a foot or two from my head, and Ms. Justice held it on me until I backed away to our truck,' Metz said.

'I could not have been more stunned because typically when someone doesn't want to talk to the media they just tell us.'

Justice, who was hired in 2007, had been the subject of an investigation following an incident on September 4.

She was training a new worker when an emergency call came through, reporter a man having a heart attack following a game of racquetball in Ormond Beach.

The trainee accidentally sent paramedics to the wrong recreational center and, as footage of the incident demonstrated, Justice was on her phone when the mishap occurred.

Mishap: Emergency crews were sent to the wrong recreational center. Supervisor Shauna Justice was on her cell phone when a trainee entered the address. It took 15 minutes to get to the correct location

An internal review said Justice failed to properly supervise.

Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said Justice was 'remorseful' about the incident.

'She admitted her mistake,' he said.

'We messed up.

'She was very remorseful about what happened, very caring about it.
