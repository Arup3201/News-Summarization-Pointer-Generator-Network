A woman has been reunited with her brand new car after she launched a social media appeal for help after forgetting where she had parked it for a job interview. 

Fallon Jerome, 21, completely forgot where she had parked her white Seat Ibiza following an interview with Homecare 4U at Brookfield House, in Stockport, on Wednesday. 

The carer, who had driven all the way from Southampton, had only bought the £4,000 Seat Ibiza a few days earlier.

Fallon Jerome (pictured with her Seat Ibiza) was reunited with her brand new car today after she forgot where she had parked it after a job interview and appealed to the internet for help

Miss Jerome bought the white Seat Ibiza just four days before losing it in Stockport while she attended a job interview

After three hours retracing her steps, she contacted police and the local council who confirmed the car had neither been involved in a crime or towed away. 

Frustrated, Miss Jerome took her appeal to social media to ask for help in finding the car.

And Samantha Taylor, 30, responded after recognising the car and the area it was parked from the description provided.

Miss Jerome said she was embarrassed by the fuss but touched by the warm response she had received.

Samantha Taylor, from Bredbury, contacted Miss Jerome after recognising the car from the description online

She said: 'I feel so stupid but am really happy to find it, it was such a worry. 

'I have to say thanks to Samantha, she had seen the story on the internet.

'She recognised where it was and talked me through how to get there on the phone. I had no idea where it was.

Fallon Jerome recieved hundreds of sympathetic responses after appealing for help on social media

'In future I will take a picture of where I am parked and write the name of the street down.'

Miss Taylor, from Bredbury, said she was glad to be able to help the stranded visitor, adding: 'Being from Stockport I know the area and knew where the car was.

'I saw the story on Facebook so sent Fallon a message and talked her through where to go.'

Hundreds responded online to Miss Jerome’s plight, expressing sympathy and sharing their own stories of lost keys and missing vehicles.

After losing her car, Miss Jerome had said: 'I'm not bothered about looking daft because I know I was and I just want my car back. 

'I'm upset and I've been crying, I'm just frustrated I let myself do that.

'I rang the council and was told it hasn't been towed away. 

'It was on a residential street that may have been a cul-de-sac and there was a walkway nearby.

'I'm hoping someone will see it and let me know as I just can't find where it is.'

Since sharing her plight online the carer has been reunited with the car. Thanking those who came forward for their help she wrote on Facebook: 'This girl can't help it. 

'Thank you... for helping. Stupid, won't do that again.' 

'Found it.. blond moment! (sic)' she added.  

The 21-year-old care worker appealed for help online after misplacing her new car days after buying it
