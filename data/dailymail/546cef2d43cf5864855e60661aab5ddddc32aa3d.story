An artist has blasted a gallery as 'fearful' after discovering her nude portraits had been censored with strategically placed strips of paper.

Danuta Gray, 74, has removed her three watercolours of naked women from Birmingham’s Botanical Gardens studio two weeks before her exhibition was due to end.

Gallery bosses have stood by their censoring, which was prompted by a teacher's complaint during a school trip.

Furious: Danuta Gray, 74, was incensed when she discovered her paintings had been covered up

Mrs Gray, a former gynaecologist, immediately withdrew all her paintings - including a male nude, which, inexplicably, was left uncovered - when she heard about the decision.

'It’s a nonsense,' she said. 'You can’t even see a nipple! They are showing such ignorance.

'Nudes have been depicted since the fourth century BC. They are present in all cultures.

'Rodin’s sculpture of a nude male and female entwined in The Kiss has been on show at the Tate since before 1955, as well as numerous paintings of nudes, including those by Picasso and Matisse.

'The Tate does not cover up these works of art, and the people who come to see these exhibitions are in family groups, with children of all ages and people of all nationalities and cultures.

'There is nothing as beautiful as the naked body.

Complaint: At first, gallery bosses took the paintings down after a teacher complained on a school trip

'Fearful': Mrs Gray accused Birmingham Botanical Gardens of 'hypocrisy, prejudice and fear'

'I never thought that the Botanical Gardens would exhibit such hypocrisy, prejudice and fear. This is England.'

Initially, the paintings were removed.

But when Mrs Gray discovered and complained, they were reinstated and covered up.

Mrs Gray, who moved to Birmingham from Poland in 1947, said: 'They explained the gallery was being used as a classroom.

'They were all aged seven. It is rubbish. With all the terrible things on TV, I’m sure the children of today know more about the human body than I do.

'First the paintings were removed altogether but I got them put back up. Then a friend was incandescent to see my female nudes covered with bits of paper. She tried to complain but the woman in charge wouldn’t come out.

'I was enraged by this censorship since I have exhibited nudes there many times before and in other galleries without problems.

This 1917 painting entitled 'Reclining Nude (on Her Left Side),' by world-famous artist Amadeo Modigliani, is regarded as a classic. It was auctioned off at Christie's Auction House in New York in 2003 for $26.88 million

Accepted: Mrs Gray argues galleries such as Tate Britain proudly display nude paintings for all audiences

'In the end, I took all my five paintings down, although the exhibition should be on for another fortnight.'

Members
of the Midlands Painting Group, who have placed 59 works of art in the 
gallery, have announced they will boycott their own annual exhibition in
a show of solidarity.

Artist Rita Greengrass took down her paintings on Thursday.

She said: 'I don’t want to be part of it. I am disgusted. How dare they accept pictures and then censor them?'

Last night the Botanical Gardens management stood by their decision.

A spokesman said: 'The Birmingham Botanical Gardens welcomes diverse audiences from around the world.

'We do our very best at all times to ensure everyone has an enjoyable time whilst they are on site.

'Sometimes we have to adapt spaces for use by different sectors of our audiences at different times.'
