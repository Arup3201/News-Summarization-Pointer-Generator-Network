Apple's iPad mini has already sold out online - just hours after preorders for the £269 gadget opened.

It goes on sale next Friday - but those wanting to buy online are being told they will have to wait an extra week, or go and queue at a shop.

The 7.9inch gadget is expected to be hugely popular, but faces competition from Amazon's Kindle Fire HD, which went on sale yesterday, and Microsoft's Surface, which launches today.

Just hours after online preorders opening, Apple's initial stock of the iPad mini had sold out, with customers facing a week delay.

The tablet wars: How they stack up

Similar scenes have been repeated in the US, where customers are also being warned of an extra week's delay for the white model of the mini.

However, experts say Apple is likely to have stock in stores.

'It was very quick - they are launching it around the world, so are restricting stock - or it really is that popular,' said Stuart Miles of gadget web site Pocket Lint.

'However, I would expect Apple will have plenty stock in stores - and Apple prefer people to visit stores, to sell them extras.

'If you're looking to buy one, i think like the iPad 3, lines will go down very quickly - people won't be signing up for contracts, so will be moved through very quickly.'

The 7.9inch iPad mini next top the larger 9.7 inch iPad. Experts say the smaller unit could cannibalise sales of the larger iPad

Mr Miles also believes the new mini version will hurt sales of the larger iPad.

'I think it will cannibalise sales of the larger iPad - it's more handbag friendly, and that will appeal to a lot of people.'

The launch comes as Apple’s stock dipped nearly $100 after delivering  a second 
straight quarter of disappointing results, with iPad sales falling well 
short of Wall Street's targets.

It is believed consumers were waiting for the new model to be announced.

Shares
in the world's most valuable technology company briefly fell to levels 
not seen since the start of August, after it delivered a 27 per cent 
rise in revenue for its fourth quarter while earnings rose 24 per cent.

The
numbers, while in line with expectations, lacked the positive surprises
that investors had grown used to and came after Apple undershot revenue
targets in the previous quarter.

During
Apple's call to announce its results, boss Tim Cook also opined on 
Microsoft's new Windows 8-based Surface tablet that will hit stores in 
the wee hours of Friday.

‘I
haven't personally played with the Surface yet, but what we're reading 
about it, is that it's a fairly compromised, confusing product,’ he 
said. ‘I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I 
don't think it would do all of those things very well.’
