With his shirt stained with blood and a nasty gash above his left eye, Paul Merson makes his way home after a stay in hospital.

The former England footballer said he was lucky to be alive following his 70mph motor- way smash in the early hours  of Wednesday.

But now Merson – whose addictions to gambling, drugs and alcohol drove him to the brink of suicide – is at the centre of a police investigation after being arrested on suspicion of drink-driving.

Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson was pictured leaving Warwick Hospital yesterday after sustaining cuts to his head following a crash on the M40

Merson claims he fell asleep at the wheel of his car before the collision occurred

The ex-England and Arsenal star was pictured at a Children In Need charity gala, just hours before his early morning crash yesterday

The 43-year-old was breathalysed at 
the side of the M40 near Warwick after his £40,000 black Mercedes 4x4 
collided with a Ministry of Defence lorry just after 3am.

The Sky Sports pundit, who had  been 
driving home to Sutton  Coldfield in the Midlands from a charity gala in
Battersea, South London, told officers he had fallen asleep at the 
wheel and careered into the central reservation before smashing into the
lorry.

The father of five was taken to 
Warwick Hospital in the early hours of Wednesday, where he received 
treatment for facial injuries and provided a blood sample.

Merson could face prosecution if it proves positive for too much alcohol.

He was allowed home after six hours, 
and was photographed leaving the hospital with blood  on his white shirt
and stitches on his forehead.

The driver of the lorry – a 45ft-long MoD freight carrier – was treated for whiplash.

Merson famously celebrated after the 1993 Coca-Cola Cup final by pretending to down drinks

Merson said: ‘I fell asleep and just 
hit the central reservation. I banged my head on the windscreen and the 
car is a write-off. I’m very lucky to have survived.

‘I managed to get out by myself and 
the emergency services were brilliant. Now I want to get home and have 
some rest.’

Twice-married Merson, who won two league titles with 
Arsenal, has fought a well-documented addiction to gambling, alcohol and
drugs for more than two decades.

The former England star was driving a black Mercedes SUV, like the one pictured, when he crashed

Merson, 43, played for England 21 times and now works as a Sky Sports pundit

In 2003, he claimed to have won his 
battles with alcohol and cocaine, but admitted that he was still plagued
by his gambling problem.

He narrowly avoided losing his home 
five years later after falling behind with his mortgage payments, and in
his recently-released memoir, How Not To Be A Professional Footballer, 
revealed he had lost some £7million to bookmakers over the years.

A police spokesman said the crash happened between junctions 14 and 15 of the northbound carriageway at 3.12am.

‘Following a roadside breath test, the
43-year-old male driver of the Mercedes was arrested on suspicion of 
driving with excess alcohol,’ she added.

She confirmed that the man had been released by police, who were still investigating the collision.
