Difficult time: The Archbishop of Canterbury has revealed how he questioned God's role following the death of his first child in a car crash

The Archbishop of Canterbury has revealed how he questioned God's role following the death of his first child in a car crash.

In an emotional interview, the Most Rev Justin Welby told the BBC's Songs of Praise programme how he received the answer he 'did not want' after praying with his wife Caroline following the death of seven-month-old Johanna in 1983.

His comments come after a new survey revealed today that four out of five British adults believe in the power of prayer.

Johanna died five days after a car being driven in France by a family friend swerved off the road and crashed.

The Archbishop told the programme: 'That was prayer at its rawest because it's just prayer of, "Oh God help. Oh God where are you? What's going on? Are you going to do something or aren't you?"

'And I suppose the deepest moment in that was finding a moment when we were in a café outside the hospital on the day Johanna died.

'And we were talking and we were praying and we had a sense in ourselves of needing to say to God, 'Your will be done'."

He went on to add: 'Praying that, a sense of handing over — absolutely agonising — and going back to the hospital, and the professor of intensive care saying to us, "She suddenly seems to be going".

'The presence of Jesus in that room was simply overwhelming. And there was a sense of handing her over. And that was prayer, at its most profound and getting exactly the answer we didn't want.'

The interview was broadcast on Palm Sunday and in the programme the Archbishop also told of the 'enormous privilege' he had in taking on his role as leader of the Church of England.

A new survey in the run-up to Easter has found that four out of five British adults believe in the power of prayer.

While some said they would pray for world peace, others had more everyday concerns - turning to God for relationship troubles or stressful jobs.

Women were more likely to pray than men, with 85 per cent citing something they would pray for, according to the ICM poll commissioned by the Church of England.

The young and the old were more likely to seek religious guidance than the middle-aged, with 89 per cent of the over-65s and 85 per cent of those aged between 18 and 24 saying they had something to pray for.

An end to world poverty, exam success and family and friends' health also featured in the list of most prayed-for topics.

Only 14 per cent of participants said they would never pray and 5 per cent said they would not know what to pray for.

The Bishop of St Albans, the Right Reverend Dr Alan Smith, said money and employment worries were leading more people to come and talk to him about prayer.

He said: 'Prayer is one of the most natural and instinctive of human responses, so I am not surprised to see these findings. I come across people on an almost daily basis who want to talk about prayer and how to do it.

'There has also been a desire to pray for troubled spots in the world, not least when we see the appalling photos from Syria on the television.'

A website where people can post their prayers to be read by church groups and communities, www.prayoneforme.org, was launched by the Church of England last year.
