It is the most dangerous peacetime job a man can do.

And for the wives, mothers and daughters who lose their loved ones to the sea rather than to war the burden is no less to bear.

Now, modelling themselves on the success of the Military Wives, a group of women bound together by heartbreaking loss are finding support in each other, and singing.

The newly formed Fishwives Choir have recruited almost 40 members from fishing communities all across the UK.

Each has lost a relative to the sea and this week, with the help of the man behind the Military Wives, they recorded their first charity single.

Modelling themselves on the Military Wives Choir, the newly formed Fishwives Choir have recruited almost 40 members from fishing communities all across the UK who have lost a relative at sea

The choir was the brain-child of mum-of-four Jane Dolby, 47, whose trawler-man husband Colin was drowned in a freak storm off the coast of Essex in 2008.

As a young widow Mrs Dolby was confronted with the grief of losing her husband but also the struggle of providing for her children as a single mum.

She admits she was left ‘penniless’ and without the charity the Fishermen’s Mission providing her with both financial and emotional support, says she ‘wouldn’t have survived.’

Now her idea to bring together women with similar experiences has come to life and their single, a unique arrangement of the Fisherman’s hymn ‘Eternal Father’, is set to be released in July.

But Mrs Dolby, who works for a children’s charity in her home town of Southen-on-sea, never intended to launch a choir.

She wanted to try and raise some money for the charity, suggesting to a few friends via Facebook that they do a karaoke style song to sell in the local pub.

But almost overnight, she says ‘things snowballed’ and she found herself being contacted by women from all over the country asking if they could join in too.

The choir was the brain-child of mum-of-four Jane Dolby, 47, whose trawler-man husband Colin was drowned in a freak storm off the coast of Essex in 2008, and now they're releasing their debut charity single

She said: ‘It’s so amazing to have had this little idea over a year ago and see it finally all coming together.

‘Most of us have has never even met each other other face-to-face before this week, let alone sing together but we’re all here for the same reason, to pay tribute to men we loved.

‘Colin made me a better person because he was someone that always did the right thing so I know he would be pleased that now I am doing the right thing for the Fishermen’s Mission.

‘The Mission supported the children and I from the first few hours after Colin went missing, I just can’t say enough good things about them.’

Mrs Dolby has also got huge support from another all female choir and even recruited their music producer Phil Da Costa to help too.

She added: ‘The support we have had from the Military Wives has been fantastic - we all of us have the same fear that when our men go to work we don’t know if we’re going to see them again.

‘Living with that uncertainty hanging over you everyday bring us together and we all feel a strong and common bond.

‘Very often Colin went to work and he didn’t earn enough to cover the cost of diesel he put in the boat but it’s not just a job it’s in their blood.

Music producer Da Costa, who produced the Military Wives' number one album, has donated his time to help the Fishwives and says he believes they have every chance of achieving the same level of success

‘He had 400 years of fishermen in his family, he used to joke that he had salt water in his veins.

‘We want to use music to remind people yes we should be proud of our military and yes we should also be proud of our fishermen.’

Music producer Da Costa, who produced the Military Wives’ number one album, has donated his time to help the Fishwives and says he believes they have every chance of achieving the same level of success.

He said: ‘The Military Wives became so successful that we set standard in pop music for choirs with the number one single and album.

‘They captured people’s hearts and I think this can be another one of those true life stories that really strike a chord with people.

‘It’s a very personal project for me, I’ve known Jane for years and I remember receiving the e-mail she sent us all in 2008 saying that her husband had gone out fishing and hadn’t come back.

‘This is a very similar thing to what we did with the Military Wives, a lot of them hadn’t sung together before but it means they’re a completely blank canvas and I find that really exciting.’

Sue Hendriks, 57, was one of the first members of the choir, as soon as she saw the Facebook advert she knew she had to be a part of it.

She lost her husband Brian 12 years ago when he disappeared while out fishing on the rocks near their home in, Perranporth, Cornwall.

She said: ‘On the day he died it was too rough for them to go out on the boat but he decided to go out angling off the rocks instead.

‘At tea time that day I had a knock on the door from the police saying they had found his fishing gear on the rocks and that he was missing.’

Brian’s body was found nine days later by one of his colleagues.

He had a fractured skull leading officials to believe that he slipped on the rocks before being washed out to sea. He was 43.

Mrs Hendriks said she joined the Fishwives with her daughter Jennie Ainsell, 29, to pay tribute to Brian.

Their single, a unique arrangement of the Fisherman's hymn Eternal Father, is set to be released in July and they starred on The One Show this week

She added: ‘I wanted to do this in memory of Brian, he was a fisherman from the time he left school, the job meant the whole world to him.

‘The Fishermen’s Mission was so good to us, they don’t get as much publicity as some other charities but they offer vital support.’

Morna Young, 29, is one of the youngest members of the choir.

She was five when her father Donnie, then 43, was pulled over board with the nets while fishing in the North Sea.

As a professional musician Miss Young, from Burghead, Scotland, jumped at the chance to join the Fishwives and volunteered as one of the three solo vocalists.

She said: ‘The thing that is special about this choir is that we all share part of a very special identity.

‘Fishing is always told from a male point of view but that is why this choir is so amazing, it tells the stories of the communities through women’s eyes.

Peter Shaw from the Fishermen's Mission said it was 'incredibly rewarding' to watch the choir rehearse and called them 'an inspiration'

‘Most of us have really only just met but we feel like we know each other already, fishing is something that is in your blood, I can’t describe it.’

Peter Shaw from the Fishermen’s Mission said it was ‘incredibly rewarding’ to watch the choir rehearse and called them ‘an inspiration.’

He said: ‘We are a charity and we have people doing all kinds of things to raise money for us but this is really tremendous.

‘A whole group of fishwives coming together to sing for us is such an inspiration.

‘It helps raise our profile and raise our funds but it also gives us a feeling that we made a difference in supporting these families when they needed it, it makes it all incredibly rewarding.

‘It’s a beautiful way of saying thank you.’
