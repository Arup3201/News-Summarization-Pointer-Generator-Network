It was certainly the trip of a lifetime when a nine-year-old boy visited Florida with his family - and saved a life while he was there.

Ethan Temmen pulled a drowning two-year-old girl to safety after he noticed her in his hotel swimming pool in Lake Buena Vista, Orlando.

The brave boy from north east London was given a Citation Award Medal by the Orange County Sheriff for his courage.

Ethan was swimming one one evening last week when he noticed the girl, who he had been playing with that day, floating face down in the swimming pool at the Wyndham Hotel, Lake Buena Vista.

The quick thinking nine year-old picked the toddler up and swam her to the edge of the swimming pool where adults performed CPR.

Ethan's brother, Aaron was quick to the 
mark as well and ran to the hotel reception to have them call 911 after 
he saw his brother retrieve the girl.

'Amazed': Ethan was delighted to be able to help the two-year-old girl who he had met earlier that day

The brave boys knew exactly what to do after practising water rescue routines at home, where they are both avid swimmers according to their mother. 

Sheriff Jerry Demings said Ethan swam into three feet of water to retrieve the child's limp body and pull it to the edge.

'I got really scared and decided to help her', Ethan said,after receiving his medal.

'I'm just really amazed that she is still alive.'

The boys' mother, Susan Thompson was beaming with pride at Ethan's award ceremony, where Orange County Sheriff, Jerry Demings praised her son's 'selfless actions and quick thinking.' 

Ms Thompson said: 'I'm just so proud of both of them and I'm just so glad the little girl's OK. In my eyes they're heroes.

'All my friends know I've got two special lads.'

The family were rewarded by the hotel too with free passes to Disney World for the remainder of their trip. 

'We want to send him back to England as a rock star,' said Jay Leonard, the hotel's general manager.

The little girl had been in the care of a relative who lost sight of her for a moment.

She has made a full recovery since the incident.
