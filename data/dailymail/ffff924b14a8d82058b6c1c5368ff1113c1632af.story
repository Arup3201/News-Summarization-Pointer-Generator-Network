Microsoft has officially released Windows 8.1 - an update to its Windows 8 operating system - during a keynote speech at its annual developers conference in San Francisco.

The free test version of the update is available to download now and the full version will be released to Windows 8 users later this year.

Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer also confirmed that the start button has been reinstated in Windows 8.1 after it was controversially removed from Windows 8 last October.

Microsoft has officially released an update to its latest operating system called Windows 8.1 during a keynote speech at its developers conference in San Francisco. A preview download is available now and the full version will be rolled out to Windows 8 users later this year

The lock screen is being turned into a 'cloud-powered photo frame' that will shows photos stored on the device and in SkyDrive.

Windows 8.1 also includes a vastly improved 'search' function, which allows a user to search for documents, apps, or items on the Internet from a single search bar.

It also allows users to see all their applications immediately in a grid by swiping down or pressing a button on-screen.

There are new personalisation options for tiles including colours and fonts.

Users can also customize the start screen much more easily; changing sizes of app icons or controlling which apps appear.

For the first time, it will be possible to open two windows simultaneously in the new-look interface.

Windows 8.1 includes Microsoft's latest browser, Internet Explorer 11, and lets the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view.

‘Let’s make it easier to start applications in the way we
are used to,’ said Ballmer, to cheers from the audience.

‘We will bring back the start button, and you can boot
straight to the desktop if you want to.’

‘We have refined the blend of our desktop experience and
our modern app experience.’

The firm came under fire for its controversial ‘start
screen’ in Windows 8, which gave users a series of tiles instead of a traditional desktop PC
menu with a start button.

This left many confused, and caused a slower than
expected uptake of the new software -  which also faced increasing competition
from Apple and the tablet market.

However, Ballmer said the firm was not abandoning its
start menu and said it was slowly beginning to attract app developers to
Windows 8.

‘Within this month we’ll pass the 100,000 app mark in the
Windows store,’ said Ballmer.

Flipboard, Facebook and the NFL all revealed new apps.

The new Windows 8.1 includes a 
vastly improved 'search' function, which lets users search for 
documents, apps, or items on the Internet from a single search bar.

The feature resembles Apple's Spotlight feature.

Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, pictured, announced the Windows 8.1 update at the Build developers conference in San Francisco. He also unveiled a new range of Windows Phone handsets and touchscreen Windows 8 laptops and notebooks

Another new feature in Windows 8.1 also allows users to easily see a list of all their apps simply by swiping up on the screen.

‘This update shows how much more responsive our engineering has become,’ said Julie Larson-Green, head of Windows at Microsoft.

‘We’ve had over 800 updates to Windows 8 since we launched it.’

Larson-Green showed off a new Acer 8.1inch tablet running Windows 8.1 - designed to take on the iPad mini.

It uses new gestures such as being able to slide along the screen's space bar to select menu items.

Larson-Green also showed off a range of touchscreen PCs running Windows 8.1.

‘Pretty much every screen you own is going to be touch,’ she said.

She demonstrated a convertible Windows 8 laptop that also works as 
tablet, and large touchscreen machines.

There were also laptops with touchscreens plus an 18inch tablet from Dell that doubles as a desktop computer when docked.

Speaking at the developer conference, Microsoft's head of Windows, Julie Larson-Green, pictured, announced that the Xbox Music app has been redesigned. The music-streaming service is now available for all versions of Windows 8

Microsoft has additionally built direct support for 3D printers and even Lego robotic kits into Windows 8.1.

During her speech, Larson-Green unveiled a redesigned the Xbox Music app, a music-streaming service, integrated into all versions of Windows 8, too.

The Spotify-killer app lets owners stream and buy music from anywhere in Windows.

Elsewhere, users can customise the start 
screen much more easily, changing sizes of app icon 'tiles' or 
controlling which apps appear.

For the first time, it will be possible to open two windows simultaneously in the new-look interface.

Ballmer promised the firm would continue tweaking the software to make it easier to use.

A preview video earlier this month suggested that the update would reinstate the Start button, pictured. The button was removed from Windows 8

‘Rapid release is the new norm for everything we do, from Windows to hardware,’ he said.

Windows
8.1 includes Microsoft's latest browser, Internet Explorer 11, and lets
the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view.

Earlier this month Microsoft released a preview video showcasing all these new features.

Microsoft
removed the button from the Windows 8 operating system when it was 
released last year but many customers complained and demanded it was put
back.

Screenshots leaked in May suggested that Microsoft would be reinstating the button and an official preview video at the start of June confirmed it - albeit not directly.

During the preview demonstration, Harris swipes between screens and lands on the Desktop view.

A Windows logo is shown in the bottom left-hand corner.

Although it will not be labelled 
'start', the leaked screenshots suggested that Windows logo would takes 
the user straight to a grid of applications.

To catch a glimpse of the button, skip to 2.11 in the video above.

That
feature was missing in the initial version of Windows 8, which was 
designed to make the most of limited screen space on a tablet but tended
to disorient traditional mouse and keyboard users.

Executives say the plan is now to update Windows periodically, rather than waiting three years or so between big releases.

The world's largest software company is 
hoping to kickstart sales of its latest Windows version, which has not
made the splash with computer users it was hoping for.

The lock screen on Windows 8.1 is being replaced by a 'cloud-powered photo frame' that automatically pulls in images from SkyDrive accounts

Although
Microsoft has sold more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses since 
October, broadly in line with Windows 7 three years ago, the company 
must tackle a dwindling PC user base and its inability to make a mark in
the exploding tablet market.

Shipments
of traditional PCs - the most reliable gauge of Windows' popularity - 
are expected to fall almost 8 percent this year, while Microsoft's 
Surface has taken less than 2 percent of the tablet market.

Windows 8 was designed to be used both on touch-screen tablets and traditional PCs.

But while touch-screen users tend to 
like the new 'tile'-based interface, many mouse and keyboard users 
complained that the new design was confusing.

Windows 8 was launched in October last year. Microsoft chose to remove the start button as part of the interface overhaul. This angered many users who said the new software was too complicated to use. In response to this backlash, Microsoft is reinstating the button into Windows 8.1 and making sorting apps and searching simpler
