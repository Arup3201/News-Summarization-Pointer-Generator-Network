Fear: Sharna, 15, now faces bringing up her baby, due in August, alone after her boyfriend Grant Adams died in a freak sunbed accident on Sunday

A pregnant 15-year-old has told of her fear as she faces bringing up a child alone after the father of her baby died in a freak sunbed accident.

Sharna Gardner was left devastated when her boyfriend Grant Adams, 17, tripped and landed on the free-standing sunbed, piercing his jugular vein on the smashed tubes.

The teenager had just got out of bed when he stumbled over a wire and onto the glass booth before falling down the stairs.

Despite rushing to hospital from his home in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, he died hours later.

Now, Sharna, who is seven months pregnant, faces bringing up their little girl on her own.

The schoolgirl, of South Shields, said: 'It’s heartbreaking to think my daughter will never get to see her dad through one accident.

'She will never get the chance to meet him even though I know he will be looking over her.'

Sharna, a pupil at South Shields Community School, had just left Grant’s house before the accident happened on Sunday morning.

Minutes later, paramedics from the Great North Air Ambulance Service arrived at the family home at around 9am.

Grant, who had just qualified as a bricklayer, was given treatment to stem the flow of blood and he was flown to Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary for treatment.

But medics told his family there was nothing more that could be done and he died on Monday afternoon.

Sharna said: 'I had just left him before he fell over.

'I found out when the police knocked at my door and woke me up.

'They told me he had had an accident. He had just bought his car and I thought he must have had an accident in that.

'They said he had fallen down the stairs. I didn’t think it was serious and when I found out how bad it was I still had hopes for him.

'When I found out he was brain damaged I broke my heart but I still had hopes.

'Then I found out he was dead. I would never have expected that to happen. I would never have expected Grant to have died.'

The couple had been looking forward to the birth of their little girl in August and Grant had chosen the name Rhkiya Mae.

'It hasn’t hit me,' said Sharna. 'I don’t want to believe he’s gone.

'The last two months with Grant have been the best we’ve had. It’s so sad that it has come to an end. I just wish I hadn’t left him on the Sunday morning.

'I’d slept there on the Saturday night and left early on the Sunday morning. I rang him at eight and he was fine.'

Devastated: Sharna had stayed over at Grant's house on Saturday night and left minutes before he fell

Grant had just bought his first car and was taking driving lessons. He was also due to celebrate his 18th birthday this month.

Sharna added: 'He was the kindest boy ever. He would have done anything for anybody.

'I’m just in shock. I don’t want to accept it really.

'I’m just waiting for a text. I used to cry if he didn’t reply in an hour. It’s horrible knowing he’s never going to reply again.

'I’m just lucky to have part of him inside me.'

It is believed Grant ripped the tube from the canopy sunbed, which was being stored in his third-floor bedroom for his mother Amanda Smedley, from his neck while in shock.

Ms Smedley, 37, said she found her son in a pool of blood following the accident.

The mother-of-two said: 'I just heard a couple of thuds from his room. I shouted to him and I ran upstairs. He was just there in a pool of blood.

'He was at the bottom of the stairs, he’d fell down them. He must have tried to come and get help.'

Grant was fit and healthy and was a keen boxer. His organs will now be donated to give other patients a chance of life.

His older sister Natasha Smedley, 20, who has one-year-old daughter, Amelia, said: 'It would have been what Grant would have wanted,' said Natasha.

'There are people waiting for transplants and hopefully Grant’s organs will help someone else.

'We don’t want any other family to have to go through what we’ve gone through.'
