Police are hunting for these seven man who are believed to be Chelsea fans who may also have been singing 'abhorrent' racist chants.

In a fresh scandal for the Premier League football club, a commuter at St Pancras Station made a complaint about supporters allegedly shouting 'disgusting' abuse.

British Transport Police believe these men had just returned to London last Wednesday after Chelsea's Champions League match with Paris Saint Germain. 

24 hours earlier the club's supporters caused worldwide outrage after they repeatedly pushed a black man off the Paris metro followed by chants of 'we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'. 

Appeal: Police want to speak to these four men pictured, seen as part of a group of seven at St Pancras Station, about allegations of racist chants

Row: The alleged chants in London came hours after Chelsea fans were heard singing: 'We're racist and that's the way we like it' in Paris. Police would now also like to speak to these men

It is not known what the St Pancras gang are accused of shouting, but it is believed to be similar to the Metro chant. 

Two of the seven men pictured today have already contacted the police after the appeal.  

Detective Sergeant Steven Graysmark said: 'I want anyone who knows the men in the photographs to come forward. I believe the seven, thought to be Chelsea fans, can help us with the investigation'. 

Supporters have identified at least six people as either witnesses or participants in the Paris incident.

They are Josh Parsons, a 21-year-old City worker, and his younger brother, Benji; Jordan Munday, 20; Mitchell McCoy, 17; and 23-year-old Jamie Fairbairn. 

In a statement today, solicitor John Kaye, who has been engaged by Chelsea fan Jamie Fairbairn, 23, said his client had accepted being among those in the carriage of the Metro train in Paris during the incident involving the black man, Souleymane Sylla, on the evening of February 17.

Mr Kaye added that Mr Fairbairn denies preventing the black man from boarding or using words of a racist or threatening nature, and also denies saying anything of a racist nature during his visit to Paris or later at St Pancras. 

Abuse: The Chelsea fans could be heard chanting 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' on the train. Police also want to speak to these men seen in Paris

Pushed off the train: The shocking footage was filmed before the Premier League team's 1-1 draw in a Champions League fixture with Paris Saint-Germain at Parc des Princes 

Identified: Scotland Yard released images of the men they believed were among a group of supporters who allegedly pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song in France

Mr Kaye said Mr Fairbairn was not even present during the alleged racist chanting incident at St Pancras.

The solicitor added that media interest in the story had forced Mr Fairbairn to move away from his home and he had been suspended from work.

'On behalf of Mr Fairbairn, I have been in contact with the Metropolitan Police to offer Mr Fairbairn's assistance as a witness,' Mr Kaye said. 

The latest to be named was Richard Barklie, 50, a former police officer and human rights activist from Northern Ireland. 

Mr Barklie issued a statement through his lawyer in which he admitted involvement in an 'incident' that resulted in Souleymane S being 'unable to enter part of the train', but denied singing any racist songs.

Scotland Yard is investigating but cannot arrest people for offences which happen outside the UK. It is likely to seek football banning orders.

Police in France are also probing what happened and anyone convicted of singing racist songs can face three years in prison and a £33,000 fine.

Circled: Jordan Munday has been named locally as  being on the train.  There is no suggestion he was involved in the pushing of the passenger or the racist chanting but could be a key witness for police

Richard Barklie, pictured, has been identified as one of the people wanted in connection with the Paris Metro racism row. Mr Barklie is a former RUC police officer from Northern Ireland and a human rights worker

Five people have so far been suspended from Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into the incident.

The club has reiterated its promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the altercation and is helping police in the UK and Paris.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said the club were 'appalled' by the racial abuse, adding that owner Roman Abramovich was also 'disgusted'.
