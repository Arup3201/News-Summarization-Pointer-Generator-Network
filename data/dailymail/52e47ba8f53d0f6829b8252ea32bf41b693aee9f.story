July was the hottest month on record in the continental United States, even beating the most sweltering month in the devastating Dust Bowl of 1936, federal scientists have revealed.

The country's average temperature was 77.6 degrees F (25.3 degrees C) which is 3.3 degrees higher than the 20th century average, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted.

Records, which began in 1895, show that the previous warmest month was July 1936 when the average temperature across the nation was 77.4 (25.2 degrees C) degrees F.

The staggering statistics come after a summer of severe weather - including devastating fires plaguing Colorado, tornadoes ravaging Washington D.C. and crops drying out across the Midwest.

Sweltering: July was the hottest month in the U.S. since records began, scientists have revealed. Here, people relax in the sand at the Brooklyn Bridge Park pop-up pool last month

Cooling off: It was also the hottest January to July period and the hottest 12-month period on record

'It's a pretty significant increase over the last record,' Jake Crouch from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center said. '[It] is out and beyond those Dust Bowl years. We're rivaling and beating them consistently from month to month.'

Across the country, 32 states had months that were among their 10 warmest Julys, but only Virginia, had the hottest on record, which Crouch said indicated the breadth of the heat and droughts.

The Midwest, the Plains and along the Eastern Seaboard were particularly sweltering, with cities including Denver, Indianapolis and St Louis all smashing records for their hottest month on record.

Remarkably, record daily high temperatures up until August 5 this year have already eclipsed the number of record daily highs set during all of 2011.

The
Midwest, where 75 per cent of the country's corn and soybean crops are 
grown, struggled under near-record drought conditions,  NOAA's Drought Monitor reported.

77.6 Average temperature in degrees Fahrenheit across the U.S. in July

3.3 Degrees higher than the average for the 20th century

77.4 Previous record in degrees Fahrenheit for hottest month, set in July 1936

63 Percentage of U.S. covered in drought

2.57 Inches of average rainfall across U.S

0.19 Number of inches of rainfall lower than country's average for July

2 million Number of acres burned by wildfires

27,042 Number of temperature records broken or tied so far in 2012

According to The Weather Channel, 
there were 26,674 daily record highs broken or tied during 2011, while 
there have already been 27,042 this year - with five months still 
remaining.

July also 
marks the end of the hottest January-to-July period since record keeping
began, as well as the warmest 12-month period, taking over the record 
set just last month.

It 
makes it the fourth time in as many months that the record for the 
hottest year has been smashed. The top 13 warmest 12-month periods since
1895 have all occurred since 1999.

As
well as crippling heat, moderate to extreme droughts ravaged the 
country last month, covering nearly 63 per cent of the continental U.S. -
the worst since 1956.

Rainfall totaled less than 50 percent of the normal amount for the month, records show, while no measurable rain fell in some areas.

Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and Maine had totals among their driest ever.

As a result, this year's corn crop yield
could be the smallest in six years and the third year of declining corn
production - sparking high prices and supply shortages.

The drought triggered a surge in the 
prices for home-grown corn and soybeans to record highs in July, with 
values rising about 50 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, over the 
past two months.

Crouch said the drought and heat helped each other along to create devastating conditions.

Dry soil drives up daytime temperatures, and as dry soil prevailed over so much of the country, it helped make things hotter over a wide area, Crouch told Reuters.

'The hotter it gets, the drier it gets, the hotter it gets,' he said.

He said that this summer is set apart 
from the Dust Bowl summer of 1936 due to warm nighttime temperatures, 
whereas in 1936, records were set by daytime highs.

July's sizzling heat and droughts also created the perfect conditions for wildfires; more than two million acres burned throughout the month, nearly half a million acres above average.

NOAA also has a measurement called the U.S. Climate Extreme Index, which tracks indicators of unusually high and low temperatures, droughts, floods, storms and hurricanes.

The index is calculated as a 
percentage, which suggests how much of the country is experiencing 
extreme weather. In July is was 37 per cent - beating last July. The 
average is 20 per cent.

And between January and July this year, the index was 46 per cent, which smashes the previous record from 1934.

In a response to how the unprecedented heat is damaging farmers' livelihoods, President Obama called on Congress on Tuesday to pass a farm bill so disaster aid can flow to farms.

'It is a historic drought and it is having a profound impact on farmers and ranchers all across many states,' Obama said during a meeting of Obama's rural council at the White House.

Crop insurance will provide a safety net for row-crop growers but ranchers have less of a federal cushion. Crop insurance indemnities could be double or triple last year's level, economists estimate.

The measurements cover all states excluding Hawaii and Alaska.
