Scar: Wayne Urwin's injuries were so severe that he suffered bleeding in his brain and had to have part of his skull removed during an emergency surgery

A DJ had part of his skull removed and is now unable to listen to music after he was hit by a thug in a vicious attack on a night out.

Father-of-two Wayne Urwin was struck by Aaron Robson following a dispute outside a bar in Morpeth, Northumberland, in March.

The 36-year-old’s injuries were so severe he suffered bleeding in the brain and was put in an induced coma after emergency surgery to remove part of his skull. His family was told that it was unlikely he would survive the vicious attack.

Mr Urwin, who came out of a coma and began a 'miraculous recovery', said that his 'life has completely changed' since the attack.

The damage done to his brain means that he 
can no longer work as a warehouse manager and has been placed on statutory sick leave. He said 
that as a result of this he has lost his flat - and must now claim for 
benefits for the first time.

Mr Urwin, who used to volunteer at Radio Northumberland in his spare time, continues to suffer seizures and fits, which have left him unable to drive or listen to music.

But he explained the hardest part is the way the attack has affected his two children, aged seven and four.

He said: 'Seeing my 
daughter’s face when she came to visit me in hospital, you could tell 
she was really frightened when she saw me with all the staples and scar.

'I
 can’t drive to see them and I only get to see them now when my dad 
brings them round. I used to have them for one half of the week and 
their mother used to have them the other half. That is really difficult.

'It’s
 been hard losing my independence and it has been hard financially but 
it’s so difficult not having a gauge on when I’m going to get better. 
It’s the uncertainty of the future.'

Damage: Mr Urwin is awaiting another surgery to place a metal plate where part of his skull was removed from. He said he holds no hate towards Robson, who last week pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm without intent

Despite the horrifying impact the attack has had on his life, Mr Urwin said that 'he never held any anger' towards his attacker.

Mr Urwin spent more than a month in hospital and his now living at home with his mother in Sunniside, Gateshead. He is awaiting further surgery to have a metal plate put into his head to cover the area where the piece of skull was removed.

Mr Urwin said: 'I don’t remember anything about the actual night. I remember getting off the train and meeting my friends in a bar but that’s it. I don’t remember anything after that.

'I know there is CCTV of me arguing with Robson outside the pub but then we disappear from view and he apparently punched me and I fell to the ground. He ran off and it was passers-by that helped me.

'Completely changed': The father-of-two, pictured left before the attack, said that his life is very different now. Mr Urwin, pictured right today, can no longer work as a warehouse manager and said he has lost his flat

'The first thing I remember is coming round from the coma. I remember opening my eyes and seeing my mate. I was really distressed and confused, I didn’t know what was going on.

'For some reason, I thought I’d been hit by a car. I was like that for a fortnight, really confused and not understanding what was going on.

'My memory was really bad. I couldn’t remember anything after about 30 seconds, which made me really distressed.'

Mr Urwin, who now sees a psychiatrist and attends support groups for people with head injuries, will once again have to go back to intensive care when he has further surgery to insert the metal plate.

He said: 'I feel like I can’t begin to properly move on until the plate is in.'

'It’s always looming there and I know I have to go back into hospital. I feel like a line can’t be drawn until that is over. I’m also have a drainage tube put in as my head doesn’t drain fluid properly. I’ll have that for the rest of my life.

'I know the doctors have said I’ve had a miracle recovery and I try to stay positive and focus on getting better. They say it will take about two years.'

Robson, 20, of Cramlington, hit Mr Urwin outside the Shambles pub in Morpeth, Northumberland on March 30.

Robson pleaded guilty to grievous bodily 
harm without intent at Newcastle Crown Court last week. The case was 
adjourned for sentencing.

Mr Urwin said: 'Weirdly, I never held any anger towards him. He’s got his own issues and I need to stay positive and concentrate on my health and recovery.

'I do want to see justice done and I think he should go to prison for at least two years. I’ve lost at least two years of my life so, I would like to see him lose two years of his.'

Mr Urwin's father Colin said the attack had had a devastating impact on the entire family.

The 64-year-old said: 'You just can’t describe what it was like when we first saw him in hospital. It was just horrendous. Looking back, it’s all a bit hazy as we couldn’t believe what was happening.

'Wayne’s recovery has been absolutely fabulous but all we want now is for him to get his proper life back and to get settled.'
