Raheem Sterling arrived at Liverpool's Melwood training ground on Monday morning to prepare for their important clash with Tottenham - but it looks like the England flyer could be a few quid down.

The 20-year-old drove to work with a yellow parking ticket clearly visible on the windscreen of his white Range Rover.

But he still looked in a better mood than Mario Balotelli, who hasn't started a league game for the Reds since January 10.

The Italian striker was left out of Brendan Rodgers' squad for Saturday's 0-0 draw in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park.

The 24-year-old has failed to find the net since his return to the Premier League in the summer, with his only two goals for Liverpool coming in cup games, one against Ludogorets in the Champions League and the other against Swansea in the Capital One Cup. 

Liverpool had planned to offload the Italian, who hasn't featured in the league since their 1-0 victory against Sunderland nearly a month ago, in order to bring in Danny Ings but they failed to move the striker out of the club.

Lucas Leiva arrives at Melwood for a scan on his thigh after sustaining an injury in the Merseyside derby 

Rodgers' side has been in fine form recently having gone eight games without defeat in the Premier League.

However, the Reds have had a potential setback as the club fears defensive midfielder Lucas Leiva could be sidelined for a month due to a thigh injury. 

The Brazilian lasted just 15 minutes of the clash with local rivals Everton  after damaging his thigh.

The player will have a scan on Monday to discover the full extent of the damage done.
