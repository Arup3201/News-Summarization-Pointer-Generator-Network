The white lesbian mother who is suing a Chicago sperm bank for accidentally sending her a black man's sperm says she worries other families cold suffer the same mix-up. 

Jennifer Cramblett sobbed as she described how she and her partner Amanda Zinkon must now move out of their small, all-white hometown of Uniontown, Ohio, so their mixed-race daughter Payton will be accepted.

Ms Cramblett, 36, is suing Chicago-based Midwest Sperm Bank for allegedly sending her the wrong sperm samples after a receptionist transposed a number on the pape rwork. Donor 380, the sperm donor Ms Cramblett and Ms Zinkon had picked to father their child, was a blonde-haired, blue-eyed white man. She was sent vials of sperm from donor 330, a black man.

'I am happy that I have a healthy child,' Cramblett told NBC News through tears. 

'But I'm not going to let them get away with not being held accountable.'

She added: 'We had to take this into our hands because I will not let this happen again. I'm not going to sit back and let this happen to anyone ever again.' 

Ms Cramblett told NBC that she and her partner had specifically picked a blonde-haired, blue-eyed donor so that the baby would look like her partner, Ms Zinkon. 

Despite the lawsuit, Ms Cramblett says she and her partner love Payton dearly.

'You can't just go, "Well you got a baby. You got a baby so you should be happy. Lesbian couple can't get a baby anyway. You should be happy that you have a healthy child."

'I am happy that I have a healthy child. We love her more... to this day, she's made us the people that we are. Never trade it for the world,' she said, her eyes welling with tears. 

'But I'm not going to let them get away with not being held accountable.' 

In a lawsuit filed this week in Cook County, Illinois, Ms Cramblett says Midwest Sperm Bank sent her several vials of a black man's sperm by mistake because the clinic keeps paper records and accidentally transposed numbers on her order. 

Midwest Sperm Bank charged $400 per vial of semen and Ms Cramblett and her partner received six vials of the wrong semen.

The lawsuit says the clinic later sent Ms Cramblett an apology note and a refund for the six vials - though charged her for the vials of the correct semen she received.

Ms Cramblett she has 'limited cultural competency relative to African-Americans' and worries that her daughter Payton will not be accepted in her hometown of Uniontown. 

 'Jennifer lives each day with fears, anxieties and uncertainty about her future and Payton's future,' according to the lawsuit. 

Ms Cramblett, the assistant manager of an AT&T store, said she and her partner Amanda Zinkon love their daughter, who is now two years old, but say they must now consider moving to a more diverse community.

Ms Cramblett says her family is racist and has not fully accepted her sexuality. Having a mixed-race daughter makes it even harder, she claims in her lawsuit

Ms Cramblett says she's thankful she had a healthy daughter, but she says even simple tasks like getting Payton's hair cut can be dau

Ms Cramblett says in her lawsuit that much of her family is racist and that one uncle openly makes racist comments.  

Even simple tasks have become more complicated because Payton is mixed-race, the lawsuit says. 

'Payton has hair typical of an African American girl. To get a decent cut, Jennifer must travel to a black neighborhood, far from where she lives, where she is obviously different in appearance, and not overtly welcome,' according to the lawsuit.

Ms Cramblett says she grew up in Scio, Ohio - population 762 - and didn't meet a black person until she attended college. She currently lives in Uniontown, population 2,802, and fears Payton will be the only non-white child in class when the time comes for her to attend school.

Ms Cramblett says her family has difficulty accepting the fact that she is gay and encourage her to hide her sexual orientation when she is around them. 

She says no matter what she does, Payton cannot hide her race - nor should she have to. 

Ms Cramblett is alleging breach of warranty and wrongful birth.

Midwest Sperm Bank would not comment on the case.
