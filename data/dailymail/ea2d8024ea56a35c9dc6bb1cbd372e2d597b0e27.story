Defence Secretary Liam Fox unveiled a radical raft of reforms to purge military top brass, reduce rivalry between the Army, Royal Navy and RAF and cut waste and red tape at the cash-strapped department

Outspoken military chiefs were ‘putting lives at risk’ by warning that Britain would struggle to fight the Libyan war for more than six months, Liam Fox said yesterday.

The Defence Secretary issued the warning as he admitted for the first time that the UK could be forced to cut firepower elsewhere in the world if the conflict dragged on.

Dr Fox slapped down commanders as he announced the biggest shake-up in the Ministry of Defence in more than half a century.

He unveiled a radical raft of reforms to purge military top brass, reduce rivalry between the Army, Royal Navy and RAF and cut waste and red tape at the cash-strapped department.

The remarks about Libya came on the day the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, accusing him of crimes against humanity.

The Government has been under pressure after Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, the First Sea Lord, and Air Chief Marshal Sir Simon Bryant, second-in-command at the RAF, publicly questioned whether the UK could sustain operations in Libya after severe defence cuts.

Last week an exasperated David  Cameron told service chiefs: ‘You do the fighting, I’ll do the talking.’

Yesterday Dr Fox waded into the row. ‘We must be very careful, those of us who have authority in defence, in discussing the sustainability of our mission,’ he said. ‘People’s lives are at stake. We may have to reprioritise some of our assets – but let us make it clear that there can be only one message that goes out to Libya.

‘That is: we have the military capability, political resolve and legal authority to see through what we started. We will continue our mission until our mission succeeds and Col Gaddafi must get no other signal than that.’

Ministers fear that offering any crumb of comfort to the Libyan tyrant ¿ whose regime has been bombarded by airstrikes for more than 100 days ¿ could spark a bloody fightback against Nato troops, rebel forces and civilians

Ministers fear that offering any 
crumb of comfort to the Libyan tyrant – whose regime has been bombarded 
by airstrikes for more than 100 days – could spark a bloody fightback 
against Nato troops, rebel forces and civilians.

Dr Fox unveiled an 82-page report by Lord Levene’s defence reform unit calling for a root-and-branch shake-up of the MoD.

The report criticised the ‘bloated and dysfunctional’ department for leaving ministers ‘in the dark’ about key decisions.

Dr Fox told the Commons that the MoD 
was ‘top heavy’ and over-bureaucratic, which had led to poor 
decision-making and financial management.

The MoD is attempting to plug a 
£36billion black hole in its budget caused by ordering equipment that it
cannot pay for. As revealed by the Daily Mail last week, the heads of 
the Army, Royal Navy and RAF will be booted off the MoD’s most senior 
decision-making body, the Defence Board.

They will be replaced by three 
non-executive members on a new streamlined board in an attempt to get a 
grip on the MoD’s ‘appalling’ procurement spending record.

The move has been seen as revenge for tensions that have built up between the Government and the military.

But the three service chiefs will get
more control over their individual budgets including how to split funds
between training, personnel and equipment.

Dr Fox said this would end a 
situation in which military chiefs spent most of their time ‘trying to 
influence policy and haggle over funding in London’.

He signalled that the number of 
senior officers – including generals, admirals and air marshals – would 
be culled and fresh blood brought in to make the forces more 
‘meritocratic’. Sources said a third of top brass could go.

Dr Fox said: ‘There is a very strong 
case for reducing the star count in the Armed Forces to create space for
those coming up the ranks.’

The MoD is shedding 25,000 civilian 
staff over the next four years as part of spending cuts announced last 
year. The forces will also shrink in size with 5,000 posts due to go in 
both the Army and Navy and 7,000 in the RAF.

Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy said the report contained some ‘sensible’ measures.

But he said: ‘While the deficit is 
temporary, the cuts they are making are permanent. Once you have sacked 
RAF pilots, you cannot reorder new ones. They have gone and they have 
gone for good. I think we will rue the day they made some of these 
cuts.’
