Roy Hodgson claims he is not certain he'd swap his managerial career for Sir Alex Ferguson's, and also admits it was once unthinkable for an England boss to pick players who were not representing their clubs every week.

The current England boss has not won a trophy since 2001 with Copenhagen, but said he would not necessarily want to swap his achievements for the former Manchester United boss', having managed 16 teams in eight countries.

Hodgson, speaking to www.britishcoachesabroad.com, said: 'Like everything else in life, you have to weigh things up.

'But if you ask me, would it have been better to have been like Alex Ferguson, to have spent life at one club, if I’d been lucky enough to do that? I’m not certain I’d say “yes, I would have preferred that”.'

Hodgson, who performed the great escape with Fulham in 2008, and also helped West Bromwich Albion become an established mid-table side, also claimed it is sometimes harder to achieve survival than win titles.

'You don’t win prizes for [keeping teams up] or get a trophy on your CV... but when (for example) you’re winning the Bundesliga with the current Bayern Munich team, is that as great an achievement as – say – keeping Burnley in the Premier League? It’s very difficult to assess these things.'

Success: Ferguson won the Champions League twice and the Premier League 13 times

Hodgson, whose England side failed to get out of the group stage at the World Cup in Brazil this summer, said he'd rather some players moved abroad for more game time than sit on the bench in the Premier League.

The 67-year-old also concedes that times have changed with the national team, and that he has to pick players who are not regularly playing with their clubs, something that was unthinkable even five years ago.

Hodgson added: 'If you’re asking, would it be better for some of our players to play regularly for a good team abroad, rather than warm the bench here, then of course. As a national team manager, I’d like to see that.

'Even as recently as five years ago – certainly ten years ago – it would be unthinkable for any England national team manager to pick a player who wasn’t the first name on his club’s teamsheet.

'Now we pick players – more than half probably – who start with us, and are certainly not the first name on their club’s teamsheet.

'They might not even get a regular game. But that’s where we are, because the clubs have a predominance of foreign players, and because they can afford it.

'They can get the best players outside of Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Bayern Munich. And basically speaking, there aren’t many clubs who can tempt away English players.'

Hodgson's England take on Norway in a friendly at Wembley on September 3, before facing Switzerland in their first European Championships qualifier on September 8.
