Two mental health nurses did monkey impressions when they discussed a black colleague during a campaign of racist abuse, a hearing was told today.

Susan Horton and Sarah Cullum allegedly called the woman a 'gorilla' and made comments like 'they shouldn't be allowed to breed' in front of other staff members.

They are also accused of seriously mistreating dementia patients at St Mary's Hospital, Kettering, Northamptonshire.

Horton referred to black colleagues as 'n****rs' and 'it' while her patients were branded 'parasites' and 'beasts', the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

She faces 44 separate misconduct charges including claims she refused to accept a student she thought might be black.

The nurse is also accused of hitting and kicking a male patient, identified only as Patient B, then dragging him from his bedroom to a corridor by his feet.

On other occasions, she allegedly shouted at him that he smelled of urine and made comments about his sexuality, including asking whether he was gay.

One of the charges she faces accuses her of 'suggesting that he was moving rooms because he was homosexual and preferred the company of men'.

Horton worked on the Ian Bennett ward and the charges relate to a series of incidents 'in or around June 2007'.

She is accused of repeatedly insulting her colleague Mary Branswahi, who it is claimed she called 'Scary Mary'.

It is alleged that 'in the presence of other members of staff' she 'would impersonate monkeys' when speaking about Ms Branswahi.

On one occasion it is claimed she said: 'Save the bananas for Mary.'

It is also said she referred to 'gollys', the jungle and claimed: 'They can't speak English.'

Cullum, who worked on the same ward, faces 30 separate charges, many of which overlap with those faced by Horton.

She is also accused of referring to the hospital's Carlton dementia ward as 'The United Nations' and claiming 'there is not a single white face next door, they're all black.'

When discussing a list of possible students she is accused of saying: 'We don't do black.'

The nurse also allegedly left a patient who was unable to get up lying on the floor for two hours.

Horton denied all but one of the charges, admitting only that she had once said words to the effect of 'excuse me skinny' to a staff member.

Cullum denied all but three, accepting she had refused to help a patient with her medication, spoken rudely to another patient and referred to Carlton Ward as the United Nations.

If the nurses are found guilty of their charges and their fitness to practise is judged to be impaired, they could face being struck off.

The hearing continues and is expected to last five days.
