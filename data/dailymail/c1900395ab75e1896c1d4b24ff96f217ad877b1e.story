Manchester City goalkeeper Willy Caballero was offered money by match-fixers to throw a game earlier this year, according to reports in Spain.

The alleged approach, which Caballero immediately reported to the authorities after declining any involvement, happened when the 33-year-old Argentine was playing for Malaga.

Spanish newspaper El Pais said the fixture in question was Malaga’s home match against relegation-threatened Elche on May 3. Elche won the match 1-0 and ended the season safe.

Malaga’s coach at the time, Bernd Schuster, said afterwards: ‘Many of my players were unrecognisable. We were out there, but not really.’

Elche and Malaga have both denied any involvement in fixing.

The Spanish league’s president, Javier Tebas, said last week he had received information about fix ‘attempts’ in La Liga last season but did not specify any games.
