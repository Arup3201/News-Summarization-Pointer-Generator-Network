One of Britain’s longest married couples have celebrated their platinum wedding anniversary after meeting when they sat next to each other in class 70 years ago.

Fred and Alicia Smith, both 93, met when they were just ten years old when Alicia was seated behind Fred during lessons.

The two credit the success of their marriage to staying active together, saying they swam, danced and cycled together as often as they could.

Alicia and Fred Smith first started dating in 1936 at age 15, when Fred took Alicia out on a bike ride

The two, from Ribchester, Lancashire, still remain inseparable and their daughter Janis Whitlock, 57, said they still hold hands while watching telly on the sofa together.

They started dating in 1936 when they first went for a bike ride together at age 15 and they have been together ever since.

After celebrating their platinum wedding anniversary on Thursday with their family, Fred said: 'We danced, cycled and swam together for as long as we could. We are still best of friends and we help each other as much as we can.

'We enjoy our time together very much. Alicia sat behind me through our time at school together and we were friends from the start.'

After school, Fred went to work for Northrop Mill in Blackburn, while Alicia worked for The Co-op Laundry Shop. Here they are pictured together during a romantic holiday in Wales in 1963 - the two did everything together

After leaving school, Fred joined Northrop Mill in Blackburn, Lancashire, as a loom maker and Alicia worked for The Co-op Laundry Shop.

WWII had dragged into its sixth year and was continuing to rage, but the British and the Allies took the initiative with the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6.

At the time it was the largest seaborne invasion in history and featured 155,000 Allied troops landing on the beaches of Normandy, France.Popular wartime President Franklin D. Roosevelt won an unprecedented fourth term in the White House, defeating Republican Thomas Dewey.The movie Casablanca, now considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, wins four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay.The PAYE (pay as you earn) system of tax collection was introduced, operating as it does today by withholding tax on income payments to employees as a form of advance payment.

They were married at St Stephen’s Church in 1944 and shortly after Fred was called up to the army and served in the Royal Armoured core, the First King’s Dragoons as a tank driver and engineer.

He served in Egypt during the war before being demobbed in 1947.

After the war, Fred returned to his old job before moving to Bury, Greater Manchester, to run a factory.

Shortly after, the pair opened a baby clothes shop in Whalley Range, Blackburn, Lancashire., which Alicia ran full-time, before moving to Ribchester, 49 years ago.

The couple have two children, six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, with a sixth due on June 21.

Fred added: 'I used to cycle on my lunch break to where Alicia worked every day so I could see her.

'I only had a push-bike with three gears so it was quite hard work. We used to enjoy going to the pictures and we’ve always done everything together.

'Family comes first.'

Their daughter, Janis Whitlock, 57, said: 'It has been great to have had them around when my children and grandchildren have been growing up.

'I’m very lucky to still have parents at my age because a lot of people don’t.

'They are a lovely couple and they are always together. They are inseparable really.

'They can’t really get around much now but they still sit on the sofa holding hands while they watch television.

'When I was little I don’t remember them ever being apart and on weekends we’d go for days out and have picnics.

'The only time they weren’t together was when dad used to play snooker at the club once a week.

'They have always been there for my children, which has been amazing and they have helped out when they could.

'They first met at junior school and haven’t looked back since.'

The couple received their third congratulatory card from the Queen on their anniversary after being sent one in 2004 and again in 2009.
