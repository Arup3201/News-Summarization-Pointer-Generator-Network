Following Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's comments on rape, his fellow Republicans have turned on him - not to mention he has earned the ire of the President himself.

Distancing themselves from the man who made the statement that the victims of 'legitimate' rape don't get pregnant because the 'female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,' prominent Republican party members have demanded that he step down.

Republican Mitt Romney said that Mr Akin's comments on rape are 'insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong.'

President Barack Obama called Mr Akin's statements on rape and abortion 'offensive' and 'way out there' on Monday, and said politicians should not be making healthcare decisions on behalf of women.

Mr Akin does have one ally for staying the race from opponent Claire McCaskill, who said today that the 'people of Missouri' ought to make the final call on his politics.

Alone: Following aspiring Missouri Senator Todd Akin's repellent comments on rape, his fellow Republicans have turned on him

Opposition: President Barack Obama chimed in calling sentiment 'way out there'

Distance: Republican Mitt Romney said Monday that Todd Akin's comments on rape are 'insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong'

'This statement is kind of a window into Todd Akin’s mind,' Mrs McCaskill said on MSNBC.

Mr Akin has served six terms and describes himself as Missouri's most conservative congressman a description Mrs McCaskill has pounced on, warning her constituents of the dangers of a 'true conservative.'

Mr Romney said he has 'an entirely different view' than Mr Akin's, calling the candidate's comments 'offensive.' The GOP presidential candidate also called on Akin to correct his statements.

President Barack Obama also took the opportunity to chime in, voicing his own opinion about women's rights.

'The views expressed were offensive,' Mr Obama told reporters in the White House briefing room today.

'Rape is rape and the idea that we should be parsing and qualifying and slicing what types of rape we are talking about doesn't make sense to the American people and certainly doesn't make sense to me.'

'First of all, from what I understand from doctors, (pregnancy from rape) is really rare,' the GOP stalwart told KTVI-TV.

'If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.'

He went on to say: 'But let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.'

Many were in disbelief that someone could present such an argument.

Voicing his opinion: Rep Akin spoke to TV station KTVI in St Louis about rape

Fight: Mr Akin does have one ally, however, in his opponent Claire McCaskill, who said today that the 'people of Missouri' ought to make the final call on his politics

'I found Todd Akin’s comments about rape victims outrageous and way over the line. He needs to apologize,' demanded Republican Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown.

When Mr Akin's comments hit the web, he unsuccessfully sought to quell the storm.

A statement from Mr Akin read: 'In reviewing my off-the-cuff remarks, it's clear that I misspoke in this interview and it does not reflect the deep empathy I hold for the thousands of women who are raped and abused every year.'

'I recognize that abortion, and particularly in the case of rape, is a very emotionally charged issue.'

He continued: 'But I believe deeply in the protection of all life, and I do not believe that harming another innocent victim is the right course of action.'

Indefensible: Reihan Salam, a National Review blogger, tweeted, 'Todd Akin ought to step the heck down'

Backlash: 'I found Todd Akin's comments about rape victims outrageous and way over the line. He needs to apologize,' demanded Republican Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown

His own party sought to distance themselves immediately, even with his tail firmly between his legs.

'Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan disagree with Mr Akin’s statement,' the campaign said.

'A Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape.'

The damage was done.

George Allen, the Republican Senate nominee in Virginia, condemned the comments as well.

'While Congressman Akin may have addressed his statement, like many men and women I strongly disapprove of his original comments — and the sentiments behind them,' he said in a statement.

'Regardless of party, we all have a responsibility to unite against any leniency on crimes against women and turn our focus to the solutions that make America stronger and safer.'

'Governor
 Romney and Congressman Ryan disagree with Mr Akin’s statement. A 
Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of 
rape.'

'Usually, we’ll give our side something of a pass when it comes to outrageous statements,' wrote conservative Rick Moran.

'This isn’t a gaffe. It’s a nuclear bomb.'

Reihan Salam, a National Review blogger, tweeted, 'Todd Akin ought to step the heck down.'

The one person who is backing Mr Akin's run is his Democratic competition.

Appearing on Morning Joe, Claire McCaskill refused to blast her opponent, recognizing that in a way, she has already won. Even the announcer introduced her as the candidate 'elected last night.'

Mark
 Halperin asked her point blank: 'Senator, do you think Congressman Akin
 is fit to be a Senator from Missouri? And would you like to see him 
step down and be replaced so Missouri voters have another choice besides
 you in a general election?'

Moving Forward: His own party sought to distance themselves immediately, even with his tail firmly between his legs. 'Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan disagree with Mr. Akin's statement,' the campaign said

'Well, first of all, it’s not my place to decide. It is the people of Missouri and I think the people of Missouri have to make this decision,' she said.

'I mean, he has some passionate supporters in the Republican party.'

In a previous statement McCaskill had announced: 'As a woman & former prosecutor who handled 100s of rape cases, I'm stunned by Rep Akin's comments about victims this AM.'

Still, the candidate has refused to step down.

'The good people of Missouri nominated me, and I’m not a quitter,' Mr Akin told Mike Huckabee, a Republican and former governor.

'My belief is we’re going to take this thing forward. And, by the grace of God, we’re going to win this race. To quote my old friend John Paul Jones: "I’ve not yet begun to fight."'
