 Some New York City cops may have turned their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio but he hasn't cut ties with them yet.

Mayor Bill de Blasio along with City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito announced today that they wish to name a street in honor of Detectives Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos who were shot to death execution style last month.

Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were working overtime as part of an anti-terrorism drill in Bedford-Stuyvesant just before 3 p.m. when they were shot point-blank in the head by lone gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, who later turned the gun on himself.

Ridgewood Avenue, between Shepherd Avenue and Highland Place in Brooklyn would be referred to as 'Detective Rafael Ramos Way.'

West 6th Street, between Avenue S and Avenue T in Brooklyn, would be called named 'Detective Wenjian Liu Way,' reports the website of NYC.gov.

A bill moving to name the streets after the slain detectives will be up for voting at a City Council meeting in January.

'Our fallen heroes will never be forgotten. Their memory lives on in their families, and in the NYPD family. And now it will live on in the streets of the communities these brave men lived in and protected. This is an expression of our pride in each of these men, and our sadness at their loss,' said Mayor Bill de Blasio today.

'We will never forget the tremendous sacrifice by Detectives Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in service to our city,' said City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito.

'These courageous men were fathers, brothers and sons, and they were committed to the protection of every New Yorker who calls this city home. The street co-namings in honor of Detective Ramos and Detective Liu will stand as an ever-present testament to their legacy and memory, and will remind us all of the daily sacrifice of our brave men, women and families of the New York City Police Department to keep our city safe.'

A few more City Council members shared their support for naming streets after some of New York's finest.

'This is a tribute to the tremendous sacrifice that our police officers make to keep New York City safe for all residents. This street co-naming will ensure that the memory of Detectives Liu and Ramos lives on in our city,' said Council Member Mark Treyg.

'Detective Rafael Ramos and Detective Wenjian Liu served New York City with honor and bravery. Their selfless sacrifice must never be forgotten. Co-naming these streets in their memory is one important way we can ensure that the legacies of our fallen heroes will live on in the hearts and minds of New Yorkers,' piped in Council Member Mark Levine.
