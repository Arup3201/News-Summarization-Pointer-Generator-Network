Disturbing footage has been uncovered of two teenagers surfing on the back of a moving bus through a busy city centre.

At one point a rider is shown tumbling off the vehicle in Perth, Scotland, and could have easily fallen under the wheels or in front of another car.

Furious safety campaigners fear a spurt of copycat attempts and want the 'dangerous and foolish' video banned.

Uproar: Footage of these two young boys shows them on the back of a moving bus in Perth, Scotland

Slip: The film shows the left teen at the moment he lost his grip of the bus and seems to be suspended in mid-air before crashing to the floor

Tumble: The one remaining rider looks down to his left as his friend is seen in a heap on the floor close to the rear left tyre after falling off the back

The footage was apparently filmed for 'comedy' Facebook page Perth Memes.

Although the fallen boy managed to narrowly escape injury, safety charity RoSPA Scotland has branded the actions of the young people involved disgraceful.

Worryingly the video has already been 'liked' by more than 700 Facebook users and shared by almost 100 people so far.

Kathleen Braidwood, road safety officer with RoSPA, said the boysâ€™ behaviour could have resulted in a serious accident.

Brainless: The two boys are shown here as they jumped on the bus in Perth

'We would encourage teenagers not to give into peer pressure by copying this behaviour,' she said.

Donald Pover, community safety convener on Perth and Kinross Council, described the footage as a display of 'utter stupidity'.

'Not only are these youths putting their own lives at risk, they are also putting other road users in danger,' he said.

'The people involved might have seen this as a bit of fun, but it could very easily have had tragic consequences.'

Holding on: After his pal fell off the other teen stayed on down the hill

End: As the bus approaches a junction the boy jumps off, incredibly not having been injured

A spokesman for Stagecoach Perth, who run the bus service, said the footage was 'very worrying'.

'This is a very dangerous activity where those involved are putting themselves, as well as other road users, at risk,' he added.

'We are thankful that no serious injuries were caused as a result and would strongly discourage this behaviour.'

Tayside Police has not yet received any complaints about the video.
