Three people were arrested by California police after they stole a $2.8million yacht and ran it aground on a beach 25 miles away.

The thieves, two men and one woman, stocked up on pizza and beer before stealing the sailboat from a marina in Sausalito and taking it for a midnight joyride.

The theft was not discovered until the 
owner watched a television news report on the three people stranded, and
recognised his sail boat.

Thief: Rescuers attempt to grab one of the two women off the back of the $2.8million sailboat stranded near the beach in Pacifica, California, before she and her two companions were arrested

Caught: Dario Mira, 54, is arrested by police as he arrives on the shore after stocking a luxury sail boat with pizza and beer and taking it for a joyride which ended in the sand

Once it became clear that the three 
on the yacht were not simply unfortunate sailors, Pacifica police 
officers were called and joined Coast Guard and fire department on Linda
Mar Beach.

Leslie Gardner, 63, Dario Mira, 54, and 
Lisa Modawell, 56, had to be removed from the 82ft vessel after spending
hours aground in rough waves just 20 yards off a Pacifica beach.

When authorities went aboard the yacht, they found cases of pale ale and a pizza box.

‘There
looks like there was quite a bit of alcohol drinking onboard,’ Jeff 
Wadkins, a state parks lifeguard and park ranger told the San Francisco Chronicle.

The
rough sea had left the contents of the boat in disarray, Mr Wadkins 
said, and the trio appeared to be suffering from seasickness.

Joyride: The 82-ft luxury sailboat were taken 25 miles down the coast in the middle of the night and was found stranded on Monday morning

Breakfast surprise: John Fruth did not know his boat had been stolen until he spotted it on the morning news stranded off the Pacifica coast

The boat was stolen from a Sausalito 
marina around 1am on Monday morning and sailed by Mira, Gardner and 
Modawell round the coast and down to Linda Mar Beach, Pacifica where it 
got stuck.

Rescue crews arrived at dawn, not knowing that the trio were boat thieves.

Mira,
Gardner and Modawell insisted they did not need help and a radio was 
delivered to the vessel by the Coast Guard to assess the situation.

During this time the boat’s owner John Fruth was watching the morning news and spotted his own boat stuck in the shallows.

‘He had the TV on when he realized that his boat had been taken and called us,’ said Sausalito police Sgt. Bill Fraass.

Officers had guns drawn and used a megaphone to order the trio to give themselves up.

The
three suspects were removed from the yacht by San Mateo County 
sheriff's deputies around noon and handed over to Pacifica police, who 
arrested them on suspicion of grand theft and conspiracy.

The boat may not be removed until high tide Tuesday as the sailboat’s 10ft keel is dug too deep in the sand.

'Right
now, the boat seems to be staying together, which is good news, ' said 
Eric Laughlin, spokesman for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.

Not moving: The yacht remain aground as the keel is stuck to deep to be removed until the high tide comes in

Joyride: The beer loving crew stole the yacht from a Marina in Sausalito around 1am on Monday and steered it around 25 miles down the coast to Pacifica before they got stuck
