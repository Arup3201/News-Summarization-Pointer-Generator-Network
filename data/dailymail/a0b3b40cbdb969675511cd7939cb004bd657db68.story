Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is deliberating over whether to delay the announcement of his permanent captain until Michael Carrick returns from injury.

Van Gaal, working with the players in America ahead of their opening game of the season against Los Angeles Galaxy on Wednesday, suffered a major setback when Carrick was ruled out for 12 weeks with an ankle injury suffered in training.

The 32-year-old midfielder was high on Van Gaal’s shortlist to be the next United captain following the exit of Nemanja Vidic.

Pre-season blow: Michael Carrick has been ruled out for 12 weeks with an ankle injury suffered in training

The manager described Carrick’s injury as a ‘big blow’ when he was unveiled in front of the world’s media on Thursday.

Van Gaal will have to name a skipper for United’s first Premier League game against Swansea City on August 16 but he is thinking about making the appointment short-term until Carrick returns.

Wayne Rooney would like the job, but Robin van Persie, Van Gaal’s Dutch captain at the recent World Cup, may stand in until Carrick returns. However, he is still on holiday and the manager has reservations over whether a compatriot who has been at United only two seasons is the right choice.
