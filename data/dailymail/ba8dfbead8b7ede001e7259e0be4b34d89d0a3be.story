Manchester United legend Andrei Kanchelskis has launched an astonishing attack on Louis van Gaal, claiming the Dutchman will never win the Premier League, not even in ten years.

The former United winger witnessed first-hand Van Gaal's new look side when he watched the defeat to Southampton at Old Trafford in the company of Sir Alex Ferguson.

But the experience wasn't  an enjoyable one as he admitted both him and Ferguson left Old Trafford gutted and upset.

Van Gaal's side put in a woeful perfromance on the day, eventually succumbing to defeat against old rival Ronald Koeman thanks to a second-half goal from substitute Dusan Tadic.

Kanchelskis told a Russian paper: 'With Louis van Gaal in charge they will not become champions for another ten years.'

'I don't understand the type of football he is instilling into his players. I don't fancy their chances with him in charge - they aren't going to compete with Chelsea and Manchester City.

'They looked awful. Seventy-five thousand people came to the stadium to watch but they were an embarrassment. I felt sorry for the fans.

'He may be able to solve some of the problems by changing his personnel but on the whole I don't fancy my old team's prospects with him in charge.'

'United's players from 1993 - the likes of Paul Ince, Eric Cantona, Paul Scholes, Peter Schmeichel, Ryan Giggs - would be tearing their hair out.'
