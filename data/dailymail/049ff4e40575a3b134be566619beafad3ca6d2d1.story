Rescuers were forced to save a swan after ice formed around its beak when it fell asleep in a Chinese river where temperatures fell as low as minus eight.

Stunned locals snapped the bizarre sight after spotting the bird swimming around in the water with ducks in the city of Korla in north western China's Xinjiang province.

Yong Hsieh who went to feed the ducks with his wife spotted the swan after throwing bread in the water and realising it couldn't open its beak.

The swan on the Kongque River in China, which had its beak frozen shut after falling asleep in a freezing river 

The 27-year-old said: 'My wife and I had been having coffee in one of the riverside cafes when we decided to take a stroll along the river and feed the ducks.

'As we walked towards them we saw the swan but as soon as we got closer we noticed its beak was covered in ice.

'We threw some bread in and the ducks happily ate it up. But the swan couldn't even open its beak.'

Worried that the bird would starve to death, Mr Yong called city officials who sent in a team from the Swan Guard.

The Swan Guard are responsible for the feeding of hundreds of swans, which migrate to the Kongque River in Korla every winter from the Bayanbulak region, 250 miles away.

Swan Guard Sheng Liang added: 'I have been caring for swans for years and I admit that this is the first time I have every come across anything like this.

'We think it must have happened when she fell asleep with a wet beak.

'We managed to lure her towards us with some food and then took her to our swan house where we care for injured or sick swans.

'Once there, we put her in a warm room and waited for the ice to melt.

Officials believe that the bird fell asleep in the river where temperatures reached as low as minus eight with a wet beak 

'Its lucky that we were informed because in these temperatures it's very unlikely that the ice would have melted if she had stayed outside.

'Once she could open her beak again we gave her a special treat of fish before taking her back to the river.' 

Temperatures have fallen so low in northern China lately even the sea has frozen, in some places up to 20 miles out from the shore.
