A Texas teen who emancipated herself from her parents in February over fears they were pressurizing her to have an adoption is back living with her mom just four months later and awaiting the birth of her son.

High school junior Reagan - who requested her surname wasn't used - took her parents to court in Harris County, Texas, to sever parental rights after they argued over whether she should have abortion.

The trouble started last summer when Reagan met a boy called Evan Burnside and the two 16-year-olds quickly became inseparable.

Family: For several months Reagan broke off all contact with her parents and lived with Evan and his family. 
But just two weeks ago Reagan and Evan moved out of the Burnsides' home and back in with her mom

Sensing a developing relationship, Reagan's mother, Denise Koen, talked to her daughter about sex and birth control.

But Reagan stopped taking her pills and soon discovered she was pregnant.

Her parents, who are divorced, were worried that their daughter was going to jeopardize her future if she became a teen mom and so they claim they gave their daughter three options – abortion being only one of them.

Afraid her parents might force her to terminate her pregnancy, Reagan sought support from Evan's family.

Evan and his mom Jaime Burnside appeared in court in February as part of the process which Reagan obtained a temporary restraining order against her parents

I was furious with both of them,’ she told ABC’s ‘20/20.’ ‘I wasn't trying to be a stubborn teenager.’

His mother, Jaime Burnside, contacted a local pro-life organization called the Texas Center for the Defense of Life.

The organization recommended that Reagan obtain a temporary restraining order against her parents and then helped build a case for why she should be granted emancipation from her parents.

The case alleged that Denise Koen kept her daughter home from school, threatened to 'slip' her abortion medication and said she was 'making the biggest mistake of her life.'

It
was alleged that her father, Jeff Koen, sent her a text to say that she needed 'an ass 
whoopin'.

The girl's parents denied in court records all allegations. The 
agreement reached stipulated that her parents would not threaten her with
physical force, and would return the teen's car, pay her cell phone bill
and pay half of her health insurance.

Reagan: The teenage daughter who emancipated herself from her parents because they had a difference of opinion over her teen pregnancy. Was there a better option?

'Right now it's a victory for life,' attorney Texas Center for Defense of Life Stephen Carey at the time.

'And
we're glad that they stood up for the right to life and that they 
recognized, our client recognized that her child had the right to live 
and she wanted to protect that.'

Reagan's parents believed their daughter was being exploited by the pro-life group to promote its anti-abortion agenda, but lost the case and so signed an agreement to allow her to marry Evan - thus emancipating her from them.

For several months Reagan broke off all contact with her parents and lived with Evan and his family.

But just two weeks ago Reagan and Evan moved out of the Burnsides' home and back in with her mom

'They made the choice to move back to my home,' Denise Koen told '20/20'. 'I know we're going to have to take everything slowly, but it's such a blessing. I'm really, really pleased that she's back.'

Both families await the birth of a baby boy in September.

'20/20: With Parents Like These' will be broadcast on Friday evening at 10 ET.
