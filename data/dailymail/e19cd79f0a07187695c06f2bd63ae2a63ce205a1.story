Eye shield: Mrs Thatcher in dark lenses 

Margaret Thatcher insisted on wearing dark glasses on her first trip to Africa because she feared black activists would throw acid in her face.

The Prime Minister believed her ‘instinctively pro-white’ stance had made her a hate figure across the continent and she insisted on donning the glasses as her plane prepared to land at the dead of night in the Zambian capital of Lusaka in August in 1979.

Lord Carrington the then Foreign Secretary reveals Mrs Thatcher’s fears for her personal safety in today’s (Sunday) edition of BBC Radio 4’s Reunion programme which reunites figures who played a role in the ending of white rule in the former British colony of Rhodesia and the establishment of an independent Zimbabwe in 1980.

Lord Carrington who was aboard the same flight said: 'What was rather interesting. I don’t think Margaret Thatcher had ever been to Africa before in her life. I don’t think so.'

He added: 'I remember as we approached Lusaka in the pitch dark she suddenly put on her dark glasses and I said to her ‘What on earth are you doing putting your dark glasses are? And she said: ‘Well I am so hated here. I am sure they are going to throw acid in my face.'

Lord Carrington recalls trying to calm Mrs Thatcher’s nerves and how she was eventually ‘overcome’ by the warmth of the welcome she received.

He said: 'I said to her no I don’t think you understand the Africans. I don’t think they will do that at all.

'I think they will probably cheer when you get in. When we arrived and touched down and there was a see of black faces all smiling she took her dark glasses off and she walked down the gangway of the airport as if they was no problem at all. She was so overcome with the welcome.'

The early months of Mrs Thatcher’s premiership were dominated by the bloody struggle for independence in the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia.

Lord Carrington recalls how he and officials in the Foreign Office tried to dissuaded Mrs Thatcher from instinctively supporting the white regime of Ian Smith who had previously declared unilateral independence for Rhodesia in 1965.

He said: 'My colleagues in the Foreign Office and I did our very best. The thing about Margaret Thatcher was that she was instinctively in favour of the whites and Ian Smith and instinctively against the Africans.

'But if you got in before the instincts had taken over the brain was very good and you had a chance of changing her mind.'

Mrs Thatcher’s visit to the Zambia was a public relations triumph and did much to heal the rift between her and other African leaders.

The visit would lead to the establishment of all party talks at Lancaster House in London which would lead to the establishment of Zimbabwe.

During the course of today’s programme Lord Carrington refuses to comment on claims that the British security services bugged the hotel rooms of African delegates who were taking part in the talks.

Lord Carrington also recalls his first meeting with Robert Mugabe who would become Prime Minister in 1980 and who continues to control the country today.

He said: 'A Jesuit Marxist is a very unusual person. I found him a difficult man. Rather slippery.'

Lord Carrington said that Mugabe did not feel any bitterness towards Ian Smith despite being held prisoner for more than eleven years.

He told the Foreign Secretary: 'I don’t feel bitter about people. I feel bitter about the system.'

Lord Carrington said the fact that Robert Mugabe had now become a brutal dictator should not detract from the success of the Lancaster House Agreement.

He said: 'The result is one man one vote isn’t it. Every party in Britain was agreed that there should be black majority rule and thats what has happened.

'It wasn’t a perfect agreement but it was an agreement which I think would have enabled Zimbabwe to become a very powerful country indeed had things had not gone wrong afterwards.'

The Reunion programme is on BBC Radio 4 today (Sunday) at 11.15 am.
