Prince George's christening went perfectly, by all accounts, with a smiling baby and a mother who could barely contain her joy.

What a contrast to the christening of George’s father William 31 years ago.

On that day, August 4, 1982, the ceremony took place in the ornate cream Music Room at Buckingham Palace, a far more formal choice than the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace where George was christened yesterday.

Relaxed affair: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge smiled throughout the ceremony, while the circumspect baby prince appeared to follow proceedings with interest

'A trial'@ A radiant Diana later admitted she found William's christening exhausting

Princess Diana, just 21 and wearing a fuchsia pink, blue and white floral dress with a pink hat set at a rakish angle, looked radiant. But she later confided to friends that it had been a trial.

‘No one consulted me as to whether 11am would fit in with William’s schedule,’ she said. ‘I was totally excluded, totally exhausted and the photos went on and on. I blubbed my eyes out.’

She wasn’t alone. Her son – William Arthur Philip Louis, 44 days old – may have uttered only three small cries as the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, poured water over his head, but he grumbled his way through the subsequent photo session.

Formalities: Diana holds William in the official photo from his christeningm accompanied by the Queen, Prince Philip and the Queen Mother

Prince Charles dabbed at his son’s tears with a handkerchief and Diana tried to soothe William by popping her finger in his mouth to suck. But every time she took it away, he cried some more.

Most of the senior royals were in attendance for William’s baptism, whereas just five attended yesterday’s event: the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry.

Prince Andrew has missed out on both occasions. He wasn’t invited to George’s baptism, and couldn’t go to William’s because he was still in the South Atlantic after the Falklands conflict.

Nor did the late Princess Margaret attend William’s baptism. She was in Italy, combining a holiday with official engagements.

Mother's pride: There were some similarities between the two events

Matching outfits: Kate carries her son after the christening, accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall  and Pippa Middleton

Prince George was incredibly well-behaved during the day's proceedings. Queen Elizabeth called the event a 'very nice' family occasion

The Queen Mother was there, of course – the date was chosen to coincide with her 82nd birthday – as was Earl Spencer, Diana’s brother (another notable exception yesterday).

The Queen wore an outfit of periwinkle blue with white spots, and yesterday she was in blue again. In contrast to Diana’s vividly coloured frock, Kate went for neutral cream.

Once the 25-minute ceremony to baptise William was over, the party moved into the White Drawing Room next to the Music Room for the photographs, which were taken by Kent Gavin, a Daily Mirror photographer of the ‘old school’. Finally there was a formal lunch.

There was no such formal sit-down meal 
yesterday. Instead, the proud parents hosted an informal tea party at 
Clarence House. The whole event, declared the Queen, was a ‘very nice’ 
family occasion.

Some things, however, don’t change. 
Those rounded cheeks, that thoughtful gaze... whether it be Prince 
George, his father William, or his great, great, great, great, great 
granny, Queen Victoria, the family resemblance is uncanny.

There
 are no photographs showing Victoria’s christening, but the undated 
photograph below of the elderly widowed monarch still shows that Prince 
George Alexander Louis has inherited many family characteristics.
