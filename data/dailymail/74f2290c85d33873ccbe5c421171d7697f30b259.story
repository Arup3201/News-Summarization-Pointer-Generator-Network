Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

This is the second time that PSG and Chelsea meet in the knockout stages of the Champions League. Last year, the Blues edged out the Parisians on away goals in the quarter finals.

They also met in the group stages in 2004/05, with Chelsea winning 3-0 at the Parc des Princes and both sides playing out a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge. PSG have failed to score in three of their four encounters with Chelsea.

PSG have reached the knockout stages of the Champions League for the third consecutive season, their best ever run. They were eventually knocked out in the quarter finals in the last two campaigns.

PSG have only lost one of their last eight Champions League knockout games (W4 D3), it was against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in April 2014 (0-2).

PSG are unbeaten in their last 32 home games in European competition (W22 D10), longest ever run for a French club. Their last defeat was against Hapoel Tel Aviv in the group stages of the UEFA Cup back in November 2006.

PSG have also never failed to score in their last 18 home games in European competition. BATE Borisov were the last team to keep a clean sheet at the Parc des Princes, in February 2011.

Seventy per cent of PSG’s goals in the Champions League this season have come in the opening and closing 15 minutes of games (7 out of 10).

Chelsea have reached the knockout stages of the Champions League for the 11th time in the last 12 seasons.

Chelsea are one of three teams still unbeaten in this season’s Champions League, alongside Porto and Real Madrid.

Chelsea scored more goals than any other team in this season’s Champions League group stages (17). 47% of them came from set-pieces (8 out of 17), the highest ratio among the 16 teams left in the competition.

Edinson Cavani has scored five goals in six Champions League games this season. Four of his five games in the knockout stages of the Champions League have been against Chelsea (with Napoli and PSG) – he was knocked out both times.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored seven goals in 33 Champions League knockout games.

Didier Drogba has scored five goals in seven competitive games against PSG (with Guingamp, Marseille and Chelsea), including a brace at the Parc des Princes in his only Champions League game played on Parisian soil back in September 2004.

Eden Hazard has completed the most dribbles in the Champions League this season (38), ahead of Lionel Messi (37).

José Mourinho has only lost one of his 15 Champions League games against French clubs (W11 D3). It was at the Parc des Princes against Paris SG last season (1-3). Coincidentally, his first ever Champions League game as Chelsea manager came at the Parc des Princes in September 2004 (3-0 win v PSG).
