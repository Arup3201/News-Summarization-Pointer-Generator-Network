Two men saved a toddler from an abduction after he was snatched from his mother while sitting with her in the middle of a Brisbane shopping centre.

The three-year-old boy  was sitting with his mother and sibling at a café in the middle of the Lutwyche City shopping centre in Brisbane's north just before 1pm yesterday when a man approached the group and allegedly snatched the child.

The mother and child let out a piercing scream and started yelling for help said witnesses.

Police charged a 29-year-old man with attempting to abduct a three-year-old boy from a busy shopping centre in Brisbane as he sat at a cafe with his mother

Two men pursued the alleged offender and pinned him to the ground until police arrived at the scene

‘It was random, he wasn’t from the shopping centre, he was just a random guy… He tried to take this little boy. He just went for the attack basically,' said Rita, who did not wish to give her surname, the manager of Valentino's Cafe, where the family were eating when the incident occurred.

‘[The boy’s mother] just screamed out, I think she said “My child”.’

Two men gave chase after hearing the mother's cries and pursued the man for about 30 metres before pinning him to the ground until police arrived.

Witnesses told The Courier Mail that the man threw the child to the ground as he ran through the shopping centre.

The boy was extremely distressed, screaming out when the incident occurred, said Brian Seo, the  owner of Sandwich City, which is next door to the cafe where the family were eating.

'The boy cried a lot, he couldn't stop for more than ten minutes,' Mr Seo told MailOnline.

'I was very shocked, I couldn't believe what I saw, the guy just looked perfectly normal, I will never understand what he was trying to do.'

The mother and her two children were eating at Valentino's Cafe when a man 'just went for the attack', said the manager of the cafe

'The public is not safe anymore': Brian Seo who owns a cafe next to the one the family were eating at says after the incident he no longer feels safe to bring his children into work

Mr Seo, who has three young children, aged four, two and six months, said he was terrified by the incident.

'People like me who have little children, I feel very scared, the public is not safe anymore. I can't believe it. Sometimes I bring my kids to work, but now I don't think I can.'

Mr Seo said praised the two men who chased the alleged offender saying: 'It was the right thing to do.'

'I thank God the boy didn't get taken,' he said.

Rita added: 'Thank God it happened here. We’re like a little village and everyone looks out for everyone else.'

Simon Brooks, 45, gave chase to the man after he heard the woman's screams, though he was not one of the two men who captured and pinned the man to the ground.

He told The Courier Mail that after the man had been stopped he was quite calm as they wait for police.

'He was actually very quiet He didn't say a word until much after when the police were there ... and there were a few of us standing around and he just said something obscene and that was it.'

The mother and child were checked by ambulance officers at the scene.

A 29-year-old man was charged with one count of child abduction last night and is due to appear before Brisbane Magistrate's Court today.
