Karlie Kloss, Irina Shayk and Isabella Rossellini's daughter Elettra Wiedemann are just some of the high-profile supermodels who agreed to bare all for a new photography book titled  Natural Beauty.

Each willingly stripped off their make-up and clothes for New York-based photographer James Houston, who has had a 'lifetime interest in the human form.'

The photo project, which also featured actors Adrian Grenier and Emma Watson, was launched to raise awareness of environmental issues and many of Mr Houston's subjects preserved their modesty with carefully placed organic props such as seaweed or driftwood.

Proceeds from the book, which hits stores on April 30, will benefit Global Green USA, a non-profit, supporting sustainability.

Several of the models chose to pose with family members.

Arizona Muse, 24, took her three-year-old son Nikko with her on the shoot and Victoria's Secret model, Jessica Hart, posed alongside her sister Ashley.

As well as women, the book also includes men. Adrian Grenier, of Entourage fame, 
stepped up in front of the camera - although his fans will be 
disappointed to note that he did not strip off.

Instead he was captured submerged in a tank of water wearing denims and a white shirt.

Like Mr Grenier, Coco Rocha another of the models who did not bare all.

As a devout Jehovah's Witness she 
refuses to pose nude or semi-nude on modelling jobs. Instead she was 
shot in a thigh-length dress and strappy heels.

Describing what inspired his project, Mr Houston, 47, who is originally from Australia, said: '[It] merges my longtime interest in the human form and my passion for the natural world.

'Natural
Beauty was created to celebrate the beauty of nature, emphasizing what 
we still have versus what we have lost.

'I hope to raise environmental 
awareness among the younger audience through this project.'

He said that he selected 'some of the world’s leading celebrities and top models who are also environmentally conscious.'

For the cover of his latest book he chose a black-and-white photo of Eighties supermodel Christy Turlington.

And it seems he isn't the only one excited about the project. Emma Watson enthusiastically tweeted last week: 'My
friend is supporting GlobalGreenUSA with his book Natural Beauty. It's 
out now. : ) X.'

The 
22-year-old actress was captured striking a number of different poses while holding a posy of flowers.

The resulting images show her 
fresh-faced with her hair wet through.

Other
leading models and celebrities who are featured in the 
120-page-book include Christy Turlington, Brooke 
Shields, Elle Macpherson and Anja Rubik.

Preserving her modesty: Coco Rocha is one of the models who did not bare all, as a devout Jehovah's Witness she refuses to pose nude or semi-nude on modelling jobs

Running theme: Touches of nature appear in each image; here model Kelsey Rogers' make-up and the movement of the camera create a butterfly effect

Contemporary dancers Edgar Anido and Christina Dooling also scored a place. The duo demonstrate their strength as they hold a tangled pose completely naked. 

Natural Beauty isn't Mr Houston's first venture into 
benevolence and his Let's Talk About Sex and Move for AIDS projects 
raised more than $1.5 million.

Natural Beauty will be available for sale on Amazon from April 30 for $50.
