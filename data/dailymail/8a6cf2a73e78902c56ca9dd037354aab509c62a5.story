The mother of a girl who says she was abused by a world famous artist has described herself as 'a moral coward' for dismissing her daughter's allegations.

The woman was giving evidence at the trial of 70-year-old Graham Ovenden, a founding member of the Brother of Ruralists collective with pop artist Peter Blake in 1975.

Renowned portrait painter Ovenden is accused of a string of indecency offences involving children dating back 40 years.

Allegations: Acclaimed artist Graham Ovenden, 70, is accused of abusing children who posed as models for him in the 1970s and '80s, a court heard

The charges relate to four victims, all young girls at the time of the alleged offending, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

They
 include offences allegedly carried out while Ovenden was taking 
photographs of them, at his studio in Cornwall and at his former home in
 London.

Giving evidence at
 Truro Crown Court in Cornwall today, one woman - once a regular visitor
 with her daughter to Ovenden's 25-acre estate in north Cornwall - 
described how she initially ignored her then-teenage daughter's 
allegations of what happened when Ovenden took her picture as a little 
girl, ten years earlier.

She
 said her daughter made the claims aged around 15 or 16. The woman said:
 'I was a moral coward. An absolute coward. I'm ashamed of it now. I 
thought: "I cannot think about it, it was such a long time ago."

'I thought: "Do I go down to [Ovenden's home in Cornwall] and confront Graham?" I didn't even tell my husband.

'I
 just pretended it didn't happen. It is awful but I didn't want to think
 about it. It is not the sort of thing you wanted to hear about your 
daughter.'

Asked by defence counsel Christopher Quinlan QC if the woman believed her daughter at the time the allegations were first made, the witness told court: 'No, I was a moral coward and swept it under the carpet.

'I remember thinking: "She hasn't told me." It is something I have never forgiven myself for.'

The court heard the woman was 'content' for her daughter to be photographed by Ovenden, and said it was 'just how life was' at the estate, which was 'chaotic' with visitors of all ages.

Asked by Mr Quinlan if she thought anything 'untoward' was going on, the woman replied: 'No, I didn't.'

The court heard the woman continued to visit Ovenden's home after her daughter's allegations. She said she went to visit Ovenden's wife, Annie - herself an esteemed artist.

However, she said she would sit around and play cards as a group, at which Ovenden would also take part.

The court heard yesterday how internationally-acclaimed Ovenden was described as a paedophile who put sticky tape over young girls' eyes as a 'ritual' before committing indecent acts.

Ovenden, who bragged to police that he had a 'major reputation' for having 'some of the best portraits of children in the last 200 years', was said to regularly invite other artists to his home near Bodmin where they would paint and take photographs based on a set theme, including Alice in Wonderland.

However, one witness told the court his home was also the setting for Ovenden's abuse of her.

Speaking from behind a screen, the woman said: 'I would have to go in by myself. I would then be made to take my clothes off and put on some kind of gown. I would have my eyes stuck down with black tape.

'We would have to go through this strange ritual.'

When asked by prosecutor Ramsay Quaife why she did not tell anyone about what happened, she replied: 'I'm sure I won't be the first or last kid to keep some horrible secret from people.'

Mr Quaife described how the four alleged victims had previously posed for Ovenden. They said they weren't able to see because they had sticky tape put over their eyes before being abused, Mr Quaife told the court. The women made formal complaints to police in the late 2000s, he said.

Mr Quaife told the court: 'What we (the Crown Prosecution Service) say is that Mr Ovenden is a paedophile, that is a sexual abuser of children. In this case we say the target of his abuse was young girls.'
