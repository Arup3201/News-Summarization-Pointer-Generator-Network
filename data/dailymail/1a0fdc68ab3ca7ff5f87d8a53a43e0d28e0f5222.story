A con woman who stole £17,000 from her dead best friend's business while pretending to be a shoulder to cry on to her grieving family is facing jail.

Danielle Pisani, 34, of Little Clacton, Essex, was a manager at Moors Health and Beauty and best friends with owner Sharon Moor.

Ms Moor, 43, died of acute pancreatitis in March 2013, eight months after a kidney transplant. Later that year Pisani began stealing from the company's accounts by overpaying herself and enjoying shopping sprees on a corporate credit card.

She was finally caught out when Miss Moor's grieving mother, Freda, became suspicious.

Checks on the accounts revealed Pisani had taken money and goods worth £17,738.

Pisani, 34, now faces jail after she admitted six charges of fraud  at Chelmsford Crown Court.

Speaking after the hearing Ms Moor's sister Jacqui Volf said: 'In the 10 years she worked with my sister, Sharon was very ill and had been in and out of Addenbrooke's Hospital.

'At times Danielle was Sharon's right hand.

'Sharon's health was so bad Danielle would have to help her out of the bath and help with other personal things.

'They were best friends.'

The court heard following her death in March 2013 Ms Moor's grieving family treated Pisani to trips to London and holidays in Spain to thank her for her support running the company's two beauty salons in Clacton and Colchester. 

Mrs Volf added: 'When Sharon passed away Danielle helped us carry on Moors but she also helped with the grieving process.

'But all the time she was stealing from us - the effect it has had has been unbelievable.'

She said her mother had suffered as a result of the betrayal, losing three stone in weight through stress.

She added: 'We would be complimenting Danielle on a new dress and all the time we would have been the ones who had bought it.

'When we looked into it further, she had been so brazen.'

Pisani's lies were uncovered when Mrs Moor became suspicious about wages.

Checks on the accounts revealed Pisani had been using the company credit card for shopping sprees at Ikea and Primark.

The family confronted Pisani who broke down in tears and admitted her guilt to them in October last year. 

Freda Moor said: 'I checked the holiday wages four times and each time it said she had been overpaying herself. 

'Cash had been taken out and the company card was being used in Ikea and Primark.

'At the end of the month we brought her in for a disciplinary hearing and she admitted what she had done and started crying - telling us how much she loved us all and that she had loved Sharon.

'We are a very close family and I treated her like a surrogate daughter.'

Ms Moor, of Tendring, Essex, had waited four years for a donor match but within eight months of her transplant she died.

Pisani admitted the charges of fraud between December 1, 2013 and October 23, 2014 at a hearing yesterday .

She was granted bail and will be sentenced next month.
