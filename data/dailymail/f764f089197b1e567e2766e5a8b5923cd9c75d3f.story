A six-year-old boy's eyes were gouged out by a woman who tricked the youngster and not organ traffickers as first thought, it emerged today.

Police said that a woman took the youngster - known as Guo Bin - into a field in northern China and then gouged out his eyes on Saturday.

His family found him covered in blood and
 crying in pain three to four hours later in a rural area of Linfen city in Shanxi province.

Injured: Guo Bin's eyes were gouged out by a woman and not organ traffickers as first thought, it emerged today. The 6-year-old is pictured recuperating from the attack

The boy's eyeballs were found at the scene and the corneas hadn't been removed - which rubbishes the theories that his corneas
 were taken for sale because of a donor shortage in China.

The boy is now recovering in hospital but has lost his sight permanently.

The Beijing Times newspaper quoted the parents of the boy, whose family name is Guo according to police, as saying that their son had told them he was walking along a path when he was grabbed by a woman. She used an unspecified tool to gouge out his eyes, they said.

An entire eye cannot be transplanted, but a cornea could be vital for a patient with faltering vision.

Guo Bin's devastated father said: ‘We didn’t notice his eyes were gone when we 
discovered him – he had blood all over his face. We thought he had 
fallen down and smashed his face.’

The
 boy was rushed to hospital where doctors were shocked to find his eyes 
had been removed. His father said: ‘His eyelids were turned inside out, 
and his eyeballs were not there.’

Recovering: The youngster was playing alone outside his home in Linfen, Shanxi Province, when he was snatched on Monday evening

Guo Bin was shown 
on state TV  being taken in bandages from an operating theatre to a 
hospital bed, writhing in agony as his shocked family wept.

China Central Television said he had been drugged and ‘lost consciousness’ before the attacker removed his eyes.

His parents discovered he was missing when they called for him to come in around 8pm on Monday but received no response.

After
 a frantic search with relatives, they found him screaming in a field 
near their home in Fenxi, north China. The kidnapper had reportedly told Guo Bin: ‘Don’t cry and I won’t gouge out your eyes.’

It had been feared his eyes were taken by organ traffickers.

China
 does not have a donor culture, but about 300,000 patients need 
transplants each year. Only about 10,000 receive organs, mainly taken 
from death-row prisoners.

Though
 the sale and transplant of organs for money is prohibited, lax laws and
 widespread corruption have fuelled a booming industry.

China is also a leading destination for ‘transplant tourists’ who travel there to obtain organs.
