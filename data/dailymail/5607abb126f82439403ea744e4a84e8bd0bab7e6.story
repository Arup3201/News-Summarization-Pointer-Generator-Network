They are the cream of Britain's academic crop. 

But when it comes to extracurricular activities, these Cambridge University students appear to have hit rock bottom.

The ten undergraduates - five female and five male - have taken risque photographs of their behinds in a bid to be crowned 'Rear of the Year'.

Cheeky: Thomas, from Trinity College, poses naked in a library in a bid to be crowned 'Rear of the Year'

Not camera-shy: Bella, left, and Amber, right, have no qualms about posing for these risque photographs

They can be seen posing naked in a range of locations around the institution - including a library, a laundry room and university halls.

They have submitted the photos - using only their first names - to independent student website The Tab as part of its 'Rear of the Year' competition.

One image shows Thomas, a second year student at Trinity College, standing naked in a library while looking down at a book.

Another depicts Bella, from Queens College, posing nude in front of a row of washing machines.

Contest: The ten undergraduates have submitted the photographs to independent student website The Tab

One girl called Pam, a student of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, is depicted in what appears to be her room in Lucy Cavendish College.

While Amber, who is reading Geography at Trinity Hall, is pictured with a 'Keep off the grass' sign - and not much else - in the university grounds.

Another entrant called Dave, from Christ's College, can be seen standing naked in front of one of the institution's historic doors. 

All of the undergraduates are completely naked from the waist down - with the exception of Gwendoline who is pictured in a pair of pink knickers.

An
'interesting fact' accompanies each photo on the website - with Amber's
comment claiming she wrote her entire dissertation in the nude.

The competition has been split into 'male' and 'female' individual contests - with all entrants posing naked 'voluntarily'.

Organisers are encouraging other students at the prestigious academic institution to vote for their favourite rears.

The winners will gain free entry to the Cambridge Museum of Technology, worth a paltry £2.  

However,
not everyone is supportive of the competition, which is being run for 
the second time despite strong opposition from women's groups last year.

Lauren Steele, Women's Officer at Cambridge University Students' Union, has condemned the online poll as 'irresponsible'.

In a joint statement with Anija Dokter, from Cambridge Feminist Society, she said: 'This is an example of immature, blind and irresponsible behaviour on the part of The Tab editors.

'I
sincerely hope they will take responsibility for the harm caused, not 
only to the women depicted but also to the broader community, for 
reinforcing sexism and exclusion.

'The Tab should immediately remove the 
photos, publish an apology and mandate that all future publications 
cannot include the misuse and appropriation of women's and other 
minorities' bodies.'

However, one female student involved in the stunt - who wishes to remain unnamed - has spoken out in support of the competition.

'My bum is in its prime, it's only downhill from here,' she said. 'It was now or never really."

A male contender for the 'Rear of the Year' title added: 'I'll be very upset if I don't win.'

The Tab has declined to comment on the poll, while Cambridge University officials have said they will not be speaking to the website's editors about the competition.
