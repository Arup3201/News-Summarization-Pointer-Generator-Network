Prince Edward managed to keep a straight face as he was shown a display of ancient artifacts during a tour of an exhibition on Roman sexuality.

The Earl of Wessex paid a visit to Brading Roman Villa on the Isle of Wight, an evacated site dating back to the mid first century, which now hosts a gallery and museum.

During his trip to the site, the Queen's youngest son was shown around a new exhibition, featuring a number of pieces on loan from the British Museum - entitled Roman Sexuality: Images, Myths And Meanings.

Artifact: Prince Edward is shown the world famous Warren Cup, which recently featured in BBC series History Of The World in 100 Objects

History: The cup is named after its first modern owner, collector and writer Edward Perry Warren, and was acquired by the British Museum in 1999

During his tour with the Villa's curator Dr Mike Bishop, the Prince came face to face with a number of eye-catching items including a large terracotta phallus, and the world famous Warren Cup which recently featured in BBC series History Of The World in 100 Objects.

The ancient drinking vessel is decorated with two male same-sex acts, and is thought to be from the first century AD.

The cup is named after its first modern owner, collector and writer Edward Perry Warren, and was acquired by the British Museum in 1999.

The Royal visitor managed to make it around the exhibits without blushing, although he did crack a smile as he was shown the famous cup.

Prince Edward is a patron of Brading Roman Villa, and visited the centre during his trip to the Isle of Wight with his wife Sophie - who paid a trip to a local primary school.

'He spent a good bit of time looking around,' Dr Bishop told the Isle Of Wight County Press.

'He was very interested indeed.'
