A growing school has relieved classroom pressure by turning a double-decker bus into a fully functioning teaching space.

When headteacher David Godfrey found there was no room in his primary school for extra lessons, he bought the bus on eBay, ripped out the old seats and replaced them with desks and a plasma TV screen.

Children at Central First School in Ashington, Northumberland, are now studying in the double-decker which accommodates around 15 pupils and took two months to renovate.

The bus cost £5,000 to buy and another £3,000 to be refurbished into a suitable learning environment

Although the bus cost £5,000 and the transformation a further £3,000, it has still worked out much cheaper than building an extension and Mr Godfrey said his pupils love studying in the vehicle.

Mr Godfrey said: 'With the pupil premium we get from the Government we can employ the staff but we didn't have any quiet areas to hold extra lessons.

'We had literally turned toilets and cupboards into working spaces, and we started to look at the alternatives.

'There are a number of TV programmes out there which have been really innovative with their use of space.

'I have quite a lot of creative people around me and we thought, well you get double your money with a double-decker bus.'

Jodie Johnson, 6, added: 'I was a bit nervous when I first got on the bus now I love it. We do lots of fun activities here.'

Mr Godfrey had looked into constructing a new build or renting porta cabins but said the cost of this ran into the hundreds of thousands.

The bus was driven up from London earlier this year and was previously used to ferry festival goers around the Isle of Wight

So earlier this year he came up with the novel idea of buying the bus and transforming it into a state of the art working space.

The bus is a fully functioning classroom throughout the whole school day with lessons of up to 12 being held on the top deck and smaller groups of two or three downstairs.

Mr Godfrey said: 'Some of the teachers were a bit unsure to begin with, but they have now completely come around to the idea.

'The children absolutely love it. It is a novelty for them to come and take their lessons in the bus.'

The bus was driven up from London earlier this year after it was bought by the school, which consists of around 550 pupils, and had previously been used to ferry around festival goers on the Isle of Wight.

The engine has now been decommissioned and it looks as though the vehicle, which dates back to the 1980s, is set to stay for good.
