A woman who suffered severe burns as her knife-wielding ex-lover covered her in gasoline and set her ablaze had been threatened by him before, and tried to file a restraining order just before the savage attack.

Security cameras were rolling at a Boynton Beach, Florida, 7-Eleven store as Naomie Breton was lit on fire by the father of one of her three children, Roosevelt Mondesir.

The 40-year-old had arranged to meet Mondesir at the store to pick up her son and was waiting in her silver Mercedes at about 3am on Monday when Mondesir showed up in his white Jaguar without the boy and began hurling the fuel over her, Boynton Beach police said.

She tried to run away and headed into the store for safety, attempting to hold the door shut.

But the 52-year-old Mondesir chased her with a large knife, possibly a machete, got the door open to pull her out and then ignited her.

In
graphic surveillance video which captured the horrifying attack, a man can be seen threatening a woman with a
large knife, struggling in the doorway of the store.

'Get away from 
me!' she can be heard shouting.

They disappear from view until she returns in a massive fireball, screaming and running around the parking lot.

Waiting: Ms Breton arrived first in her white Mercedes at around 3am on Monday to the gas station

Tricked: Roosevelt Mondesir showed up but without their son in Boynton Beach, Florida

The South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported today that Ms Breton had moved out of the apartment she lived in with Mondesir back in March, and he had threatened her several times for months after.

Just two weeks before the attack, Ms Breton filed a restraining order against Mondesir, which a judge denied due to a lack of evidence.

Mondesir, who fled the 7-Eleven on foot, was found by police officers about three hours after the incident in nearby bushes.

Terror: Ms Breton tried to run and hold the door closed but Mondesir chased after her with a knife, which can be seen in his hand in the doorway

Cops had also raided his home, where they found their 4-year-old son asleep after he had been left there alone.

Mondesir was treated for burns at 
Bethesda Hospital in Boynton Beach before being transferred to jail,. He
has been charged with attempted first-degree murder.

On his Facebook page Mondesir has himself listed as 'engaged' and his employment as a truck driver. He lists his interests as classical music, ESPN and the British comedy series My Family.

One of Roosevelt's neighbor in a subdivision of Lake Worth told CBS 12 that she was shocked upon learning about the attack.

'I'm stunned. He's not that kind of person.'

Flaming: The pair disappear from view for a moment before the woman runs back across the shot, a human fireball

Horrific: Ms Breton is last seen running around in front of the store, still on fire. She survived the attack

Vendetta: On his Facebook page Roosevelt Mondesir lists himself as an engaged truck driver

In February he was accused of threatening the victim and destroying her furniture, the CBS affiliate reported.

In March they were summoned again for a physical altercation. After the woman moved out of the 
home, police reports say she received text messages including one that 
read 'I'm all about revenge.'

It was not known if Mondesir had yet obtained an attorney.

Ms Breton is expected to survive. She was being treated at Delray Medical Center.
