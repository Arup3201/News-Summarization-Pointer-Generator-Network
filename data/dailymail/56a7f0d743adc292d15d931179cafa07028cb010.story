At the end of the day, all things considered, it has to be said we do waffle on a bit.

In fact, the average adult wastes 1.7million words over a lifetime while struggling to make a point, according to a study.

Rather than get to the point, Britons skirt around issues and use long-winded phrases to hide what they really think leading to confusion and arguments according to an American survey. 

Argument starter: British sarcasm often gets laugh, but nearly 50 per cent of Britons admit it's been misinterpreted and in some cases, caused an argument

With thousands of foreigners coming 
to the London for the Games, many tourists might be left baffled by our 
evasiveness and superfluous words with double meanings.

Foreigners aren't the only ones who have trouble understanding, with a third of us struggling to decipher what people really mean and 46 per cent wishing we 
could be more direct talking like New Yorkers who are known for their straight 
talking.

British sarcasm has got nearly half of 
Britons into am awkward situation after it has been misinterpreted, with
two in five revealing it led to an argument or dispute.

According to the survey, three 
quarters of us admit to regularly using the word ‘maybe’ when we mean 
‘no’, while three fifths often say ‘I’m fine’ when we are really 
thinking ‘I’m not, stop asking’.

Other offending phrases include saying 
‘it’s OK’ when we are really thinking ‘I am really disappointed’ and 
telling workmates ‘could we consider some other options?’ when what we 
really mean is ‘I don’t like your idea’.

The ultimate snub, which a third 
admit saying, is ‘I understand what you are saying’ when actually what 
we really want to say is ‘I disagree and do not want to discuss it 
further’.

Saying ‘that’s not bad’ actually mean
‘that’s good’ while in true British style 29 per cent shy away from 
confrontation by using the phrase ‘I kind of agree’ when really they do 
not agree at all.

Britons are worse in the workplace with two-fifths avoiding straight talking by not being direct enough with colleagues.

According to the New York Bakery 
Company over a lifetime Britons use 1.7 million unnecessary words - 60 
words every day, 420 needless words a week and 21,840 a year but when it
comes to family and friends we have no qualms telling our true 
thoughts.

The Bakery’s UK 
Vice President Simon Foster said: ‘We suspected that Brits often beat 
around the bush when making a point, but our results prove this is the 
case with the average person using almost two million unnecessary words 
in a lifetime.'

The crowds are coming: Thousands of foreigners will descend on London for the Games and many might struggle to understand when Britons don't speak their mind

To tackle the problem the company has launched a ‘guide to British’ translator to help 
foreigners cope with the quirky nuances and learn the jargon of our 
language.

Mr Foster said: ‘What better way to teach other nations British jargon than a “Guide to British” translator?

‘Our brand is all about giving the UK a taste of New York and we hope our guide breaks down the waffle to reveal a nation of straight talkers.’
