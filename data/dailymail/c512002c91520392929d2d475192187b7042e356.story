Surreal: Winemaker Duncan Schwab, 45, at his vineyard in Totnes, Devon, was Tasered by blundering police officers

A winemaker on his way home from harvesting grapes was Tasered by blundering police in a bizarre mix up over a burning car.

Duncan Schwab had driven past a burning car when police suddenly smashed his van window with a baton and fired the electrical stun device at his shoulder.

The shocked 45-year-old vintner was still reeling from the blow when he was taken to a police station in Totnes, Devon.

He was breath tested but charged with failing to stop when asked and the matter ended up in court a year on.

But at the start of the trial no evidence was offered and the court case was dropped.

Mr
Schwab, from the well known Sharpham vineyard in Totnes, maintained all
along he had done nothing wrong and did not see officers signalling for
him to stop as he passed a burning car.

After the case was dismissed, he said the incident was 'one of the most surreal moments in my life'.

He said: 'From my point of view it all
happened over a year ago but has been hanging over me since. I just 
want to get on with my work.'

The incident began in the early hours of one October morning last year when he was driving with two passengers down a local road where they encountered a burning car.

Explanations: Police said they were 'in a heightened state of alert' when they Tasered Duncan Schwab

He had been harvesting the Sharpham grapes and was on his way home.

'I reversed back and there was an officer hiding in a hedge who came out, smashed the side window and fired the Taser.'

He claimed the officers then asked him what it felt like to be Tasered, replying that it was like erecting an electric badger fence.

He said: 'They thought I was connected to the burned out car. They did not signal.'

Prosecutor Sue Roberts told magistrates at Newton Abbot, Devon, before the trial: 'The prosecution decision is to offer no evidence and we would like the case to be dismissed.'

Devon and Cornwall police said officers had been investigating an incident when a car hit a house and burst into flames.

They had been on the look out for culprits and were 'in a heightened state of alert'.

The dispute was about whether Mr Schwab had failed to stop when signalled to do so.

His solicitor Nigel Butt made a request for defence costs to be paid.
