It was launched amid huge hype to one of the largest television audiences in history.

But Madonna’s latest single, Give Me All Your Luvin’, has flopped.

She performed it in spectacular style at the U.S. Super Bowl earlier this month, watched by a record American TV audience of 114million, plus millions more globally.

Just a week after entering the British charts at a lowly 37, however, the song – the first taste of Madonna’s new album, MDNA – looks likely to drop out of the top 40 completely this weekend.

The latest figures suggest it could plummet down to 51 by tomorrow if current sales levels continue.

It is one of the worst showings in almost three decades of chart hits for the singer in a career that has generated 13 UK number ones.

Give Me All Your Luvin' was her first new track for three years - and a first release under a new three-album deal she signed with music giant Universal.

Although Madonna's previous single Revolver fared worse in 2009, reaching only number 130, it had already been available on a greatest hits album Celebration for three months prior to its release.

The 53-year-old's single prior to that, also entitled Celebration, went to number three in 2009.

Some downloads of Give Me All Your Luvin' were given away last week as a free bonus track for fans who pre-ordered the album, which meant they did not count towards the chart placing.

Some fans thought the chart position had been affected by this and would recover this week, but sales have been ever fewer.

It is the first time the lead track from one of her albums has not gone into the top ten since her debut single in 1982. And most new songs have made it into the top three.

Tickets for Madonna's Hyde Park show this summer - part of an international tour - went on sale last Friday and have still to sell out.
