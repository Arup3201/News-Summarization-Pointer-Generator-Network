A New York man is being held without bail after he viciously attacked his wife and former boss with a blow torch on Wednesday, authorities said.

Carlos Diaz, 35, set fire to his estranged wife, leaving her with second-degree burns on her body, hands, face and neck.

While she was still burning, Diaz went after the man who had recently fired him as a mechanic and tried to ignite him too.

Having attacked his estranged wife with a blow torch, leaving her with serious burns, Carlos Diaz visited the garage where he had recently lost his job and doused his ex-boss with gasoline

Diaz began the sickening attacks at 7.50 am on Wednesday on Ninth Avenue near West 207th Street in Inwood, Manhattan.

He believed his wife, 38-year-old Cathy Zappata, had been been cheating on him so attacked her in a parking lot.Â 

Diaz tried to force her out of her vehicle, striking her with the blowtorch when she refused. He then poured lighter fluid over her face and hair, and ignited it.

'In essence, judge, her entire head was set on fire with an accelerant and a blow torch,' said Assistant District Attorney Scott Leet, as reported by the New York Post.

Zappata is currently in a serious but stable condition at the burn unit at Harlem Hospital.

Diaz then moved on to the auto body shop at 3966 10th Avenue where he had recently lost his job and targeted his former employer.

The firebug doused the unnamed 60-year-old man in gasoline in preparation for burning him too. But the ex-boss managed to get free, even while Diaz was trying to set him on fire.

Diaz eventually turned himself into police. The Post reports that he told officers that he had been hoping to 'burn them both alive.'

A law enforcement source told the Post: 'He had no money, no job. He was sleeping in his van. He'd had enough.'

Yet the prosecutor argued that Diaz should not be released, claiming: 'The facts of this case scream that he be remanded.'

Manhattan Supreme Court judge Matthew Sciarrino agreed and Diaz is being held without bail on charges of attempted murder, assault and attempted assault.

Diaz is expected back in court on Friday, where it is expected he will be indicted by the end of the day.
