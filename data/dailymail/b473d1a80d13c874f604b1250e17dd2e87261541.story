Men may rejoice at this season’s hottest footwear trend, but women are holding up their hands in despair. Over-the-knee boots have returned to the High Street after a stomping comeback on catwalks.

Opinion is divided. Sexy or slutty? And can any woman over 40 carry them off? Four Mail writers put them to the test…

I look like I should be out fishing

Melissa Kite, 42

Who’d have thought that a £60 pair of thigh-hugging suede boots from Next could be so hard to get on? That was my first challenge. The second was not collapsing with helpless laughter.

The fact I’m wearing a mini-dress with no tights means the whole ensemble screams ‘schoolgirl in knee socks’. Not a look I’m particularly comfortable cultivating.

Then there are the four-inch heels. Are these boots really made for walking?

Melissa felt more like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman in her boots

They are also so tight around the ankle that I fear all circulation will be cut off, and my toes will have to be amputated. However, one has to suffer to be stylish, and I am dying to hear what my boyfriend Will makes of my outfit.

Sadly, timing is everything and he enters the bedroom just as I’m struggling, red-faced and panting, to get the boots on.

This kills the moment rather, but once I’ve paraded up and down a bit, he concedes they are ‘very nice’ . . . if I ‘plan to take up fly fishing’.

‘But don’t you think I look like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman?’ I wail.

‘More like Robin Williams in Mrs Doubtfire,’ is his response. But then Will is always like this when I try something new.

I decide I may have more luck with my friend Stephen, a gay lawyer who I arrange to meet the next day. ‘Well, this is an occasion,’ he declares. ‘It’s not every day Melissa gets her legs out.’

We cross the King’s Road in Chelsea and there’s a police car stopped at the lights. I’m fairly convinced the handsome young officer at the wheel is eyeing me up.

Then again, on the basis I haven’t quite mastered the art of walking in the boots, he may just be concerned that I’m drunk and about to stumble on his bonnet.

On the whole, I’ve really enjoyed transforming my image. I’d have loved to try on the boots with jeans — but they were too tight to cram denim into.

They add a definite sexy edge to most outfits, though, and make me feel feminine. I just have to learn how to walk in them.

My daughter cringed, which made me love them more

Frances Hardy, 57 

My daughter cringed with embarrassment which only made me love them more

It took five minutes to zip myself into my pair of £250 Duo Dita suede boots which for someone who is always in a rush, I would find particularly frustrating. The left boot slumped and rumpled like Nora Batty’s stockings and I had to wrestle it up my leg in a pose not dissimilar to one I use at the gym for leg-stretching.

Only now am I told these come made-to measure, meaning there are a number of different calf sizes available. I didn’t know boot shopping had got so high-tech! No wonder I got it wrong. Now that I’ve been fitted into my calf size they fit like a dream!

Frances modelled her boots at home for a reaction from her partner Iain

The right one, miraculously, slid on like a glove. Have I got mismatched legs or were the boots odd sizes? In either event, I was pleasantly surprised. I teamed them with skinny jeans. I loved the soft grey suede and, gratifyingly, they seemed to lengthen my leg. Also, because they’re just over-the-knee as opposed to sky-thigh-high I didn’t look as if I was auditioning for principal boy at the village panto either.

Feeling quite smug, I clip-clopped downstairs where Iain, my partner, was immersed in the sports pages. Habitually I don’t arrive in the kitchen at 8am on Saturday dressed as if for an outing to London Fashion Week. But this fact didn’t impinge on him.

‘Ahem,’ I prompted. Iain finally focused on the boots.

‘They’re quite a statement,’ he said cagily.

‘Yes, but in a good or bad way?’ I persisted.

‘Actually, they’re really quite nice,’ he added – this, I assure you, is high praise – before returning to his newspaper.

I wore the boots out to Sunday lunch at a country pub – by then I’d become quite adept at putting them on – and I couldn’t help noticing I elicited a fair few glances. Whether approving or pitying, I couldn’t say. And you can hardly accost random strangers to ask. But Linda, 57, and Paul, 59, the friends we met for lunch, liked them. For some reason, Paul was overly preoccupied with how long they took to take off.

Friends, of course, are usually kind. Family less so. My daughter Amy, 23, was forthright.

‘If you had model’s legs you’d get away with them,’ she said. ‘And you’d look better if they ended at the knee.’

I usually listen to Amy’s fashion advice. This time, however, I’m tempted – quite brazenly – to ignore it.

I’m too old to dress like a glam-rocker

Kate Battersby, 50

There may be some 50-year-old women who can totter about in snakeskin thigh boots with four-inch heels and feel coolly assured of their place at the cutting-edge of style. I’m not one of them.

Maybe it was the reaction of the guy I’m dating that did it. Having been unabashedly thrilled at the prospect of seeing me in my £525 Russell & Bromley boots, his anticipation congealed into frank puzzlement.

‘I assume you’re about to audition for a tribute band to The Sweet?’ he queried.

Kate's friend's daughter was not amused to see her wearing the same boots as Katie Price

Seventies glam-rock was not the effect I’d been aiming for. I was hoping more for the sexy transformation mastered by Anne Hathaway in The Devil Wears Prada, when she sashays around in Chanel thigh boots.

Also, my legs — which usually I list among the least hated parts of my body — don’t look all that great. My thighs appear chunky, with saggy knee-blubber settling in folds around the top of the boots.

Still, I’m sure I can rely on my friend Jane for encouragement. I stagger off to her house, attempting an air of sassy confidence and ignoring the stares of passers-by. Jane opens the door — and hoots with laughter. ‘Hooker boots!’ she cackles. ‘I never had you down as Eurotrash!’

I try another girlfriend, Catherine. She stares then giggles. ‘Dick Whittington in panto! Or one of those Errol Flynn films set in medieval times. Just slap your thigh!’

Her daughter Francesca, 21, appears. ‘I love them!’ she exclaims. At last! Acknowledgement of my rightful status as a fashion maven!

But she isn’t finished. ‘Katie Price wore those boots the other day on This Morning, and she’s like 36 — waaay too old for them.’

Enough. I go home and roll on the floor for ten minutes, wrestling with my boots to get them off, while envisaging the headline: Fire Brigade Release Ludicrous Middle-Aged Woman Trapped In Thigh Boots.

I feel like the fourth musketeer

Ruth Sunderland, 46

Certain women well beyond 40 could carry thigh boots off with aplomb. Mary Portas, for example, or evergreen rock chick Chrissie Hynde. But I’m a much more conservative dresser, partly because as a financial writer, I work in a male-dominated environment — and I’ve realised it doesn’t take much to set some men off on a train of thought that is, er, rather unbusinesslike.

However, I needn’t have worried — my £149 boots from Dune are more pantomime than provocative. ‘Hurr, hurr, where’s Athos and Porthos?’ quips my husband Michael.

He’s right — the problem with these boots isn’t that they are too tarty, but too Three Musketeers. Another downside is that they draw attention to a slight hint of thunder-thigh, even though I’m only a size 10.

Yet they are extremely comfortable, and the expensive-looking burgundy suede puts paid to any aura of dockside brothel.

The real test is whether they’ll pass muster with my 70-something mother — the world’s most merciless mutton-detector. Surprisingly, she declares: ‘Lovely autumn colour. Very stylish.’

I’ve come to realise that not all thigh boots are created equal. There are the Pretty Woman ones and the Real Woman ones.

My pair might not induce Richard Gere to rescue me but they are surprisingly chic — and they don’t half keep your legs warm.
