A Ukrainian man who is alleged to have 
stripped naked after climbed a statue of the Duke of Cambridge in 
London, broke his two front teeth trying to bite its head off.

Dan
Motrescu, 29, climbed to the top of the 20ft statue of Field Marshall 
Prince George in Whitehall, and broke off its sword before attempting to
decapitate it last week.

Westminster Magistrates Court heard how the incident could have been the result of a 'psychotic episode'.

On his head: Police were forced to close an entire section of the road - which runs between the Houses of Parliament and Trafalgar Square - while specialist officers tried to coax the man down

Mr Motrescu, a Ukrainian national of no
fixed address, has been charged with possessing an offensive weapon in a
public place, criminal damage and a public order offence.

During the incident he is said to have 'attacked' the Duke, breaking his sword off and then attempting to decapitate him.

Appearing in court, Mr Motrescu looked disheveled and exposed his stomach as he walked into the dock.

He refused to cooperate with the proceedings and the court was told he sacked his solicitor this morning.

Describing
the incident prosecutor Darren Watts said: 'Officers attended the scene
which is in Whitehall and came across a bag that had been abandoned.

'The
bag was searched and found to be empty, at which point the defendant 
was seen to climb on a statue of the Duke of Cambridge.

'The defendant was seen to attack the statue breaking off the sword and waving it around before removing all his clothes.

'He
attempted to pull the head off the statue unsuccessfully. He then tried
to bite it breaking off two of his front teeth in the process.'

Mr
Motrescu asked if he could hand a crumpled note up to District Judge 
Mike Snow which explained he was at risk of being deported.

Asked to confirm his details he said: 'I refuse to take part in this case.'

Stubborn: Despite temperatures hovering around 8C, chilled further by a mild south-westerly breeze, the man stubbornly remained on his perch apparently ignoring officers' pleas

Centre of defence: Hundreds of baffled passers by gathered in the busy road, which runs between the Houses of Parliament and Trafalgar Square,  to watch the exhibition unfold in wonder

And when asked by Judge Snow what the incident was all about Motrescu repeatedly claimed he could not remember.

A
health care professional who was in court said the defendant had been 
examined in hospital and said: 'This is possibly a psychotic episode.'

Motrescu
sat with his arms folded throughout the hearing and said: 'I want to be
deported to Ukraine and have this case heard by the courts of Ukraine.'

He
was told this was not possible and asked if he would like to be 
represented by a duty solicitor who could come to court. But Motrescu 
replied: 'I won't talk to them. I won't do anything.'

The judge asked if there was anything else Motrescu wanted to say but the defendant just stared at him blankly.

Judge
Snow said he wanted him to be looked at again by a mental health team 
and remanded him in custody until his next court appearance on November 
29.

Chilly: The naked man could be seen waving his arms, apparently speaking to emergency services on the ground, and did not seem to be holding anything
