WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy on Sunday when he made a public speech - the first time he had been seen in two months

George Galloway was last night attacked by the leader of his own party over a controversial claim that a rape allegation against WikiLeaks campaigner Julian Assange amounted to no more than bad ‘sexual etiquette’.

Respect Party leader Salma Yaqoob branded Mr Galloway’s comments as ‘deeply disappointing and wrong’ as the Bradford West MP faced growing criticism of his remarks.

In a posting on her website, she said the ‘political issues’ surrounding Mr Assange’s case should not be used to diminish the seriousness of the accusations against him.

She said: ‘Let me be clear, as a politician and as a woman. Rape occurs when a woman has not consented to sex. George Galloway’s comments on what constitutes rape are deeply disappointing and wrong.

‘There are many political issues entwined in the case of Julian Assange. These issues cannot be used to diminish in any way the seriousness of any allegations against him.’

The woman at the centre of the allegation, who is a WikiLeaks supporter, told police she had consensual sex with Assange in August 2010 but woke the following morning to find he was having sex with her again, without her consent and without using a condom.

Mr Galloway said this could not be rape, as the pair had had sex and were ‘already in the sex game’. He later defended his comments, saying he did not believe the accusations against Assange would have led to rape prosecution in Britain.

He said: ‘This has all the hallmarks of a set-up. What occurred is not rape as most people understand it.’

Mr Galloway faced a barrage of criticism after rape charities reacted with fury to his comments.

The Respect candidate in the upcoming 
Manchester Central by-election, Kate Hudson, echoed the criticism from 
her leader, writing on Twitter: ‘I am with you Salma.’

Bradford West MP George Galloway said the accusations against Assange  do no amount to rape

Businessman Lord Sugar wrote on the 
social networking site: ‘Galloway entitled to speak mind, like all off 
us.He has no factual detail of the alleged crime committed by Assange, 
so should shut his trap.’

However, some of Assange’s supporters 
defended his viewpoint. Financier Ben Goldsmith, 31, whose sister Jemima
 Khan has supported Assange, sent out a Twitter message yesterday, 
saying: ‘I’m with @georgegalloway on Assange. Trumped up Swedish “rape” 
charges are a ruse to get him to an American jail. Scary stuff.’

Mr Goldsmith later appeared to have deleted the tweet.

Another Assange supporter, former 
British diplomat Craig Murray, prompted further anger when he appeared 
to name one of the women who has accused Assange, during a live 
television debate on Newsnight. Under British law, any alleged victim of
 rape or sexual attack is entitled to anonymity.

The BBC later removed the Newsnight episode from its iPlayer repeat service.

Louise Mensch, the outgoing 
Conservative MP for Corby, said on Twitter: ‘You can tell a lot about a 
man by his supporters. Assange has Galloway and Craig Murray.’

A lawyer for Assange’s alleged victims
 yesterday called his ‘absurd’ attempts to avoid answering rape 
accusations an abuse of international asylum rules.

Asylum laws existed 
to protect the vulnerable from persecution and torture and should not be
 used to avoid legitimate criminal investigations, Swedish lawyer Claes 
Borgstrom said.

Mr Borgstrom, who represents the two 
women at the centre of the case in Sweden, said: ‘It’s an abuse of the 
asylum instrument, the purpose of which is to protect people from 
persecution and torture… it’s not about that here.

‘He doesn’t risk being handed over to 
the United States for torture or death penalty. He should be brought to 
justice in Sweden. This is completely absurd.’

Assange, 41, denies the accusations 
but claims he cannot defend himself against them because of fears he 
would be handed over to the US because of his role in the publication of
 thousands of leaked diplomatic cables.

After his last legal challenge failed,
 he skipped bail to claim asylum from Ecuador in June, and has since 
been in the country’s embassy in Knightsbridge, West London.
