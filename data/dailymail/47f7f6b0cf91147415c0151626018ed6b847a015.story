University of New Mexico cornerback SaQwan Edwards has become the latest student to be arrested in a gang rape in which a female student claims she was assaulted by three men in a moving car.

The 21-year-old from Houston remained jailed after surrendering Tuesday on a warrant accusing him of criminal sexual penetration and kidnapping. He has also been dropped from the team.

His defense attorney, Paul Kennedy, says he has 'surprising' forensic evidence concerning the allegations and that the evidence will vindicate the player.

Edwards was arrested after a female student said she was raped by three men on April 13.

Arrest: SaQwan Edwards, left and right (number 15 in October 2012), is being held without bond after he turned himself in to police on Tuesday. He is accused of raping a female student in a car earlier this month

Crusoe
 Gongbay, 20, who was slated to be the UNM Lobos' starting running back 
as a senior in the fall, also turned 
himself in to campus police on Monday and is being held on $50,000 bond.

Gongbay
 and another man, Ryan Ruff, a former student, each face two counts 
of second-degree criminal sexual penetration, one count of kidnapping 
and one count of conspiracy, police said.

At around 3 a.m. on April 13, a female student reported to campus police that she had been raped.

According to a UNM report cited by the Albuquerque Journal, the victim said she was forced to engage in sexual intercourse with three subjects while inside a moving motor vehicle.

Investigators say they consulted with the district attorney's office before requesting arrest warrants.

Investigators
 say the alleged victim underwent evaluation from the Sexual Assault 
Nurse Examiner Unit and the evidence was sent to the state crime lab for
 processing. The results from the crime lab are not back yet.

Star player: Crusoe Gongbay, 20, a University of New Mexico running back from Rockville, Maryland (left in his mug, right on the field) was also arrested in the case and has been dropped from the team

Accused: Gongbay, 20, who was slated to be the UNM Lobos' starting running back as a senior in the fall, is being held on $50,000 bond after he turned himself in to campus police on Monday

Gongbay, who is 6ft, 205lbs, comes from from Rockville, Maryland. He was recruited to UNM by former coach Mike Locksley in 2011.

After
 leading the Lobos in rushing that season, Gongbay intended to follow 
Locksley to Maryland but his plans fell through so he asked the new 
coach, Bob Davie, if he could return to UNM.

Davie
 said he was impressed by Gongbay's good academic standing and knew his 
teammates liked him so welcomed him back in August 2012. He has played 
effectively as a backup running back the past two seasons.

In a 
statement Monday, Davie said he was aware of the allegations and due to 
the serious nature of the charges he had suspended the junior 
indefinitely.

'Once this process is complete and all the details have emerged, we will handle the outcome appropriately,' Davie added.

Gongbay's lawyer has said his client is presumed innocent.

UNM Dean of Students Tomas Aguirre said the University was taking the case 'very seriously.'

'The
 Dean of Students office has met with the survivor and her family and 
offered our support and any other accommodations she might need,' he 
said in a statement.

'We 
have also connected her with the various resources available to her both
 on and off campus, including the UNM Womenâ€™s Resource Center and the 
Rape Crisis Center of New Mexico. Since this is an open investigation, 
we are unable to provide any other details at this time.'
