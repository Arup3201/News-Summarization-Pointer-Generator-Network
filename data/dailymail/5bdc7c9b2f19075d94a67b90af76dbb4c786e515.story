Jailed: Cameron Cleland admitted attempted murder and was jailed for life with a minimum term of seven years before he can be considered for parole

An infatuated public schoolboy brutally attacked a 12-year-old girl who had spurned his advances by stabbing her in the neck and throttling her.

Cameron Cleland, 16, searched the internet for ways to kill his victim before deciding to ‘gut her like a pig’. The solicitor’s son even practised his attack in front of a mirror at his parents’ £1million home.

He lured the girl to a secluded location by threatening to kill himself if she would not meet him, a court heard.

Cleland told her to ‘be quiet and submit to death’ before launching a ferocious assault. Her life was saved because a dog walker interrupted the attack.

The schoolboy admitted attempted murder and was jailed for life at Bradford Crown Court, with a minimum term of seven years before he can be considered for parole.

The defendant had been predicted to get A* grades in his GCSEs at a leading independent school. The court heard he came from a ‘highly respected family’ and his parents were in court to hear Judge Durham Hall, QC, describe their son’s ‘chilling’ response to rejection.

The judge said he carried out the attack without any ‘hesitation, pause, provocation or warning’.

‘You threatened her with rape and then tried to heighten an ordeal already beyond contemplation to a normal person – you told her to be quiet and submit to death,’ said the judge.

‘This cannot be passed off as a young man coping with sexual rejection and you have since expressed your regret that you did not kill her. Your victim was distraught, confused and bewildered and the trauma you have caused her is incalculable.’

The judge ordered that Cleland should lose his right to anonymity as a juvenile. The schoolboy told psychiatrists he would have been prepared to go to prison for the rest of his life if he had succeeded in killing her.

Michael Smith, prosecuting, said Cleland was a highly intelligent and ‘slightly geeky’ teenager who had been infatuated with the girl for some time, although she did not share his feelings.

Last October he contacted Childline to admit he liked an 11-year-old girl and found it a ‘bit weird’. He later said he wanted to rape her.

The teenager would stare at the girl on trains and filmed her on his mobile phone. A month before the attack he threatened suicide if she would not meet him and there were 130 texts between them.

Eventually he persuaded her to meet him at a secluded spot in Ben Rhydding, near Ilkley in West Yorkshire in April.

Mr Smith said the girl ‘freaked out’ when she saw him walking towards her with his hoodie up.

Cleland, who was wearing surgical gloves, asked her to go down a drive to talk and when she refused he knocked her to the ground and went for her neck with a penknife. The knife was blunt and caused only scratches so he tried to strangle her.

The girl managed to break free, but he knocked her to the ground again and continued his attack.

He was disturbed by dog walker Angela Heap, who found him astride the girl with his hands around her throat. Mr Smith said the girl remembers a woman telling her to run home.

The victim suffered wounds to her chest and hands, cuts and grazes to her back and body, bruising to her eyes and neck marks consistent with strangulation.

When Cleland was arrested he was carrying a knife with the girl’s blood on it.

A psychologist and psychiatrist concluded he was not mentally ill but could be in the early stages of a psychopathic condition.
