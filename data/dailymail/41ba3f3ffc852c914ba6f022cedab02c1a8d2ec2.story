A Connecticut high school principal and assistant principal have been charged with failing to report a sexual relationship between a teacher and a student.

Stamford High School professor Danielle Watkins, 32, is facing two charges of second-degree sexual assault for an affair with her 18-year-old pupil between September 2013 and June this year.

But police claim the liaison could have been stopped earlier as principal Donna Valentine and assistant head Roth Nordin were made aware of the situation as early as December 2013 and did not report it.

Charged: Stamford High School principal Danielle Valentine, 62, and assistant headteacher Roth Nordin, 59, are facing fines of up to $2,500 for failing to report an affair between an English teacher and her 18-year-old pupil

Now, Valentine and Nordin both face a fine of up to $2,500 each as state law requires school officials to report any suspected relationship between and adult and a student.

The student told police he was afraid to report the affair because Watkins, a married mother-of-two, threatened to fail him.

Eventually, when he finished the school year in June, the student told a guidance counselor who told the school and the Department of Children and Families.

However, according to police, the school had already conducted an independent investigation into the affair before he went to the counselor, but they had not notified the Department of Children and Families.

Valentine's attorney, Mark Sherman, says the charges are only accusations and don't reflect the principal's long commitment to the safety of her students.

Watkins, who taught English at the school, turned herself in to police in July.

She has also been charged with drug possession as she allegedly bought marijuana for the student and his 15-year-old friend - whom she also taught - and let him drive her car while knowing he did not have a license.

Her two students smoked the drug during school hours, sometimes on school grounds, the older boy told police.

On June 26, three days after telling the counselor about the affair, he went to Stamford Police to make a statement about the relationship. The 15-year-old boy also gave a statement to police.

On June 27, police officers pulled over Watkins' car and inside they found marijuana and a cell phone, which contained evidence she had sent naked photos of herself to the boy.

Lt. Diedrich Hohn, in charge of the case, told MailOnline that she was 'hostile' and 'verbally combative' during the search.

As cops pulled her over, she had tried to hide her cellphone under the passenger seat, he said.

Watkins allegedly exchanged more than 2,000 text messages and hundreds of phone calls with the teenager.

She was released on $100,000 bond and she is scheduled to appear in court July 31 after being charged her with sexual assault and sale of marijuana in regard to the first victim and sale of marijuana and risk of injury to a minor in connection with the younger boy.
