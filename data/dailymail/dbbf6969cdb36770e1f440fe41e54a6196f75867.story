It seems that robots could be policing the streets very, very soon.

The TeleBot, created by students at Florida International University, will be able to do simple police tasks like handing out parking tickets.

It is designed to be controlled remotely, and its multiple sensors and cameras mean its operator can use it to patrol the streets from anywhere.

The TeleBot will not require a human inside, like Robocop

'We want to use telebots to give disabled military and police veterans an opportunity to serve in law enforcement,' explained Jeremy Robins, who is funding the project.

'With TeleBots, a disabled police officer will be capable of performing many, if not most, of the functions of a normal patrol officer - interacting with the community, patrolling, responding to 911 calls, issuing citations.'

The robot, which is about six feet tall, gets around on wheels and has three HD cameras, giving it full 360 degree vision.

It also boasts cameras that point at the ground, which stops it from running into people, and its face will have an 'emotive display' which will allow it to express 'simple emotions'. 

Best of all, each unit costs only $20,000, a relative steal.
