The last time I squeezed myself into a cut-out swimming costume was in 1970. I was 16, at a beach party in Cornwall. Of course, back then I had an athletic, streamlined body — far superior to what you see today.

The swimsuit was black, shiny, with gold hoops that barely held it together at the sides. There was also a slash sliced out of the front, exposing most of my youthful decolletage. I looked as slick as an otter but barely dared to move in case of a wardrobe malfunction. After a day of holding my breath, I resolved to stick to my usual bikinis. Far easier  and less nerve-racking.

This summer, though, cut-out costumes are back with a vengeance in almost every High Street shop, including traditionally more staid stores such as Debenhams and John Lewis.

And unlike the precarious costumes of my youth, many claim to be secure as well as sexy, designed to bridge the gap between a bikini and a swimsuit.

So could this new breed of cut-out cossies really be the solution for those 60-somethings, like me, whose bikini days are behind them but who still want to look good on the beach?

My, this looked terrifying — but once it was on, I loved it. The low neckline was rescued by a clever clasp, which held me all in but still looked marvellously racy.

The cups also have removable padding — great if, like me, you have a generous bust. The cut-outs on the side are perfectly placed.

The print offers a visually slimming effect from the front, and the bright green border around the chest adds shape and definition.

You
 need to be a contortionist to get into this. It looks like an outfit 
from Fifty Shades Of Grey and got caught on my head, arms, legs and 
everything in between.

The fabric was itchy, the material thick and 
unyielding and it provided no support — plus the tan lines would be 
unbearable.

Oh
 dear. First the positives. It’s a lovely colour. And that’s it. This is
 for adolescents only: all frills and bows, and about as subtle as a 
sledgehammer.

I look like a 
Baywatch wannabe. It’s terribly unsupportive and I can only imagine that
 I would come spilling out  of it badly while swimming.  The body is far
 too long and it bags  in places. It’s shiny and cheap-looking, too. In 
short, I’d take a wetsuit over this.

I feel surprisingly fabulous in this. It isn’t as revealing as I’d feared because the mesh panelling covers the cut-out sections, but I still look sexy.

The asymmetric top is flattering, yet glamorous. I feel like a Bond girl — I modelled for the opening credits of A View To A Kill in 1985, so it takes me back. It also feels super-secure, though it might be marginally kinder in a darker shade. But what a shame it’s so expensive.

Wear-ability: 5/5

Black halterneck, £25, next.co.uk

I generally avoid black costumes, as the colour can wash out a mature woman’s skin. Navy is much more flattering.

But
 this is surprisingly elegant. I feel I should be sailing along the 
French Riviera. The cut-outs aren’t so large that I feel overexposed, 
nor so tight that they dig in and cause nasty bulges.

There’s
 enough support for you to pull down the top straps and spare you some 
tan lines without revealing anything — and the leg cut is safe for us 
glamorous grannies. You’d never know this was Next and not a designer.

Aztec print, £89, johnlewis.co.uk

The
 geometric print is wonderfully funky but the high leg is a bit 
unnerving. Thankfully, there is ample coverage up top without exposing 
my cleavage, and inbuilt hidden cups support my substantial bust. The 
straps are adjustable and prettily tasselled at the back.

It feels snug 
and secure but the side cut-outs were at a bad height for my muffin top,
 drawing attention to my bad bits. The edges dug in and pressed 
uncomfortably — and the tan marks from this would be horrific.

Wear-ability: 3/5
