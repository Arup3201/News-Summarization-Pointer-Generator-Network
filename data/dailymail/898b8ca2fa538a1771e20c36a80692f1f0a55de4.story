Gareth Southgate insists England’s young lions are ready for their biggest test yet after they avoided a nightmare Euro2015 play-off draw.

England were paired with Croatia in Friday afternoon’s draw in Nyon and will play the first leg at Wolves’ Molineux home next month, most likely to be on Friday, October 10, before travelling to the Balkans the following week.

There were worries that England would be handed a return to Serbia, two years after several young England players were racially abused, or given a trip to Ukraine but those concerns were to no avail.

Southgate, however, is adamant this will be a searching examination. Croatia finished top of Group Five, with 19 points from their eight games, whereas England topped Group One after taking 28 points from a possible 30 and winning eight matches in succession.

‘They were the winners of a tough group and they won all their away games, so we have no doubt that this is going to be another significant step up for us,’ Southgate told Sportsmail.

‘When I looked at the draw in its entirety, I could not see a fixture that looked “easy” and this is clearly going to be a challenge for us.

‘When I left (for Switzerland) this morning, people were saying to me “good luck” but I couldn’t understand whether they meant with a short trip or something like that – we were certainly not going to get a simple game, that’s for sure.

‘Only seven teams can get there (to the finals) so that is always going to make it a real jeopardy game. But it is crucial for their development to feel this pressure and this tension.

‘But we are going to go there with a lot of confidence and if we play with the style that we have done, and the lads keep making progress, we know we can travel with confidence.’

As for returning to the Balkans, Southgate has no concerns at all about the environment England will be heading in to. 

The venue for the second leg is yet to be selected – the Croatian FA are still in discussions with the FA – but Southgate is confident it will be safe and secure, as opposed to the conditions that were presented to England when they faced Serbia in Krusevac.

‘I have got absolutely no worries at all about taking the team out there,’ said Southgate. ‘It is a lovely part of the world and I know from working with players like Alen Boksic, Mark Viduka and Mark Bosnich that the people are friendly.

‘It will be a nice place to visit but it will be a difficult match against a side that is technically excellent. But this is a process that we are going to have to get through; they are the experiences we want these boys to have.’
