A 14-ton molasses spill has killed thousands of fish and other marine life in Honolulu Harbor, the biggest environmental disaster Hawaii has ever faced.

Hundreds of suffocated sea creatures have already been collected since Monday when a pipeline running from storage tanks to Matson Navigation Co ships spilled 233,000 gallons of molasses – enough to fill one-third of an Olympic-size pool - into the water.

Health officials expect thousands more fish to die because the high concentration of the sugary, brown goo is sinking to the bottom of the ocean 'like a rock', making breathing difficult.

'This
is the worst environmental damage to sea life that I have come across, 
and it’s fair to say this is a biggie, if not the biggest that we've had
to confront in the state of Hawaii,' Gary Gill, deputy director for the
Environmental Health Division of the Health Department, told Hawaii News Now.

The department 
has warned people to stay out of the area because the dead fish could 
attract sharks and other predators like barracuda.

Diver Roger White made a seven-minute video showing the dead sea life - crabs, fish, eels and more - blanketing the bottom of the harbor. The water has turned a murky yellow-brown colour.

'There’s nothing alive there at all,' he said. 'Everything is dead. They’re all dead and they’re all just lying across the bottom - hundreds and hundreds, thousands.'

State officials expect the spill's
brown plume will remain visible for weeks as tides and currents flush 
the molasses in to nearby Keehi Lagoon and out to sea.

Laborious: A Pacific Environmental Corporation worker pulls debris and dead fish from the water near the Matson shipyard in the Kapalama Basin in Honolulu, Hawaii, after the molasses spill

Widespread: Dead marine creatures were located at La Mariana, nearly three miles away from Pier 52 (pictured) where the faulty pipe dumped the molasses into the water during loading onto a Matson ship on Monday

Ripple effect: The molasses has spread into a number of Hawaiian marinas and harbors up to three miles away from the site of the original spill

Matson spokesman Jeff Hull said the company repaired the hole and the pipe stopped 
leaking on Tuesday morning.

However Hawaii News Now reported the state could fine Matson up to $25,000 a day for violations of the Clean Water
Act.

However the Health Department has reportedly not decided whether to take action against Matson, which makes weekly runs of molasses from Hawaii’s last sugar plantation to the mainland.

The molasses is made at Hawaii's last sugar plantation, run by Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Co. on Maui.

Meanwhile, the company said in a statement it was taking to steps to guard against future spills.

'Matson regrets that the incident impacted many harbor users, as well as wildlife,' it said.

'We take our role as an environmental steward very seriously and have a strong record of leadership in the maritime industry on a number of fronts.'

Marine biologists said the effects in the harbor area will be long-lasting.

'This is in a bay so there's not a lot of circulation, so you're not going to have flushing of this water out,' Dr. David Field, a visiting assistant professor of marine sciences at Hawaii Pacific University, said.

'So in this area where the spill occurred we're probably going to see the effects for a long time.

'As water does leave this bay area and goes out into the neighboring ocean, we can expect the effects in the long term, in days, weeks, months and probably years, to spread out over some of the South Shore reefs.'The Department of Health has added crews to collect the dead fish and monitor water quality.
