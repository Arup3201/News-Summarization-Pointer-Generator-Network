These extraordinary photographs appear to show a tree hovering in the air after despite having had a section cut out of its trunk.

But in fact it is a clever optical illusion - created using nothing more than a piece of plastic and some spray paint.  

The surreal creation was the brainchild of graphic designers Daniel Siering and Mario Schuster, from Potsdam in Germany.

Floating: This extraordinary optical illusion was created by a pair of German graphic designers

The pair had the idea after being commissioned by clients to spray-paint electricity transformer stations in order to make them blend in to the surrounding environment.  

They found an appropriate tree by the side of the road, and wrapped part of its trunk in plastic sheeting.  

The artists then painted a landscape on the plastic designed to imitate the countryside around it perfectly.  

This gives the illusion that the tree is completely see-through.

Mr Schuster explained that the experiment was inspired by their work for design firm Art-EFX, where they are used to making objects camouflaged in their surroundings.  

'The majority of customers like the transformer stations hidden so we paint the background on the object,' he said.  

'Last December just for fun - we had the idea on our minds and just wanted to try it out - we'd never expected it to cross the world through the internet like this, the feedback is colossal.  

'Now we're asked to paint for events and customers around the world.'  

A video of the illusion in place has attracted nearly 800,000 views since being posted on YouTube.
