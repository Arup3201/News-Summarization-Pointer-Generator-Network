Twice as many Britons die from a drugs overdose, compared with the rest of Europe, a new report has found

The UK death rate from so-called ‘legal highs’ is twice the European average, it emerged today.

Experts also warned that the rate at which new drugs are flooding the market continues to rise.

A total of 81 new psychoactive substances were reported for the first time in 2013, up from 73 the previous year, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) said.

Europe’s Early Warning System, a detection mechanism described as the ‘first line of defence against emerging drugs’, is struggling to cope with the rate at which new synthetic drugs are emerging.

There are fears the drugs are being produced at such an alarming rate that doctors, who have never encountered the substances, do not know they have been responsible for a person’s death.

This could mean the true scale of the problem is even worse.

Already the UK’s average mortality rate due to overdose was 38.3 per million population, more than twice the average for Europe at 17 per million.

According to separate figures, submitted to coroners, ninety-seven people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009. It means the toll has risen by eight times in three years.

Yesterday, charities also said an upsurge in legal highs was fuelling crime.

A quarter of people currently on an offender rehabilitation programme in London had been using the substances prior to arrest.

In its European Drug report 2014, the EMCDDA said the total number of legal highs available across the continent has now soared past 350 substances.

Some 651 websites selling legal highs to Europeans were identified by the agency as it warned the open sale of the designer drugs online has increased availability to distributors and consumers.

The rise of legal highs has made it increasingly complicated to assess and identify drug-induced or drug-related deaths, the EMCDDA said.

The report warned: ‘Most overdoses occur among individuals who have consumed multiple substances, and attributing causality is often problematic.

‘With the continuing release of new psychoactive substances on the drug market, there is concern that new or obscure substances that have contributed to deaths may escape detection.’

Yasmin Batliwala , chair of drug rehabilitation charity Westminster Drug Project (WDP), said: ‘ In the first quarter of this year, 26 per cent of clients on our offender rehabilitation programme indicated that they were using ‘legal highs’ prior to arrest.

'This is a very significant proportion and indicates the rise of ‘legal highs’. ‘

Experts also warned that the rate at which new drugs are flooding the market continues to rise. A total of 81 new psychoactive substances were reported for the first time in 2013, up from 73 the previous year

Earlier this month, a report by the United Nations warned that legal highs have seen an 'unprecedented expansion' in Britain in recent years , with one in ten admitting they have tried the drugs.

Researchers found new types of drugs are being detected at the rate of two a week, leaving police and drug agencies struggling to keep up.

Figures showed that 8.2 per cent of Britons questioned in 2011 had taken so-called designer drugs. Only Ireland (16.3 per cent), Poland (9 per cent) and Latvia (8.8 per cent) had a higher rate.

The Home Office last year launched a review of legal highs to look at how the country’s laws can be improved. Options include the expansion of legislation to ensure police and law enforcement agencies have better tailored powers.

The Government banned two groups of psychoactive substances in December- NBOMe and Benzofuran compounds - as class A and B drugs respectively.

Elsewhere in the report, the EMCDDA said heroin use and availability was in decline, with the number of first-time entrants to specialist drug treatment for heroin problems falling from a peak of 59,000 in 2007 to 31,000 in 2012.
