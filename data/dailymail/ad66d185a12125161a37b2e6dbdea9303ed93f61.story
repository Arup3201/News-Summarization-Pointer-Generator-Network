Speaking at a conference in London today, Sir Bruce Keogh said: 'The system is creaking, it is under pressure at the moment'

Accident and emergency services are already under strain from increased winter demand, the medical director of the NHS in England has admitted.

Speaking at a conference in London, Sir Bruce Keogh said: 'The system is creaking, it is under pressure at the moment.

'A&Es are having to address increasing demand, the ambulance services are struggling in many parts of the country and we have a number of issues to deal with, which we are tackling.'

Also speaking at the conference, Dr Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said increased pressure was partly due to ambulances being called by NHS 111 operators.

However Sir Bruce said forward planning meant the NHS should cope better with a spike in demand for A&E services this winter.

Measures included a flu plan announced in April and a system to help trusts which were struggling to plan for winter, launched in June.

A £400 million injection of funding from the Department of Health in June also helped preparation, he said.

Another £300 million boost in October assisted with staffing and bed capacity.

Sir Bruce said: 'We've started to address winter much sooner than in any of the other years.

'In winter we know that the demand on A&E changes.

'So while the activity might be slightly lower than during the summer, the proportion of people who need admission is higher.'

He said high expectations from the public and budget cutbacks were also making it more difficult for the NHS to succeed.

Sir Bruce defended proposals to overhaul the health system to create 'supercentre' specialist A&E departments.

The Keogh review, published last November, advocated the concentrating of accident and emergency services into a few specialist hospitals.

He said: 'There has been a slow and inadvertent deception that all A&Es are equal. They are not, and people in the know know that.'

He also said that demographic changes has placed greater strain on the NHS and that younger people had 'an expectation of an immediacy of service'.

Dr Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, speaking at the same conference, said: 'I think the system is under pressure but it's working pretty well.'

He said that increased pressure was partly due to ambulances being called by NHS 111 operators. 

Earlier this week it was reported that  casualty departments were forced to close their doors to ambulances nearly 100 times last month as they failed to cope with soaring patient numbers, alarming figures show.

In total, around 27,000 patients were stuck inside the backs of ambulances outside A&E units for at least half an hour because staff were too busy to take them in – a third more than this time last year.

In the worst cases they were turned away altogether.

And in early December, more than 35,000 patients were forced to wait more than four hours in A&E – the worst figure on record – separate statistics reveal.

Experts warned that the ‘bleak’ figures were indicative of a ‘crisis’ in the NHS and showed the system was ‘cracking under extreme pressure.’

And they say the situation could worsen over the next month.

NHS chiefs finally released the data indicating how hospitals are coping with the pressures of winter five weeks later than planned yesterday. 

They show the situation is far worse compared with this time last year. Waiting times data is normally released on a weekly basis from the start of November.

But NHS England said that it was being held back while they ‘reviewed’ the information – prompting concerns they were trying to delay bad news.

Last week, more than 35,000 patients had to wait more than four hours in A&E – the worst figure on record

The 95 occasions that overstretched casualty units had to divert ambulances to other hospitals is almost double the 48 in the same period last year.

A total of 6,968 operations had to be cancelled – 367 which were urgent – and 33 patients waited on trolleys in corridors for more than 12 hours.

Several hospital trusts are now on ‘black alert’ – whereby GPs are urged not to send in patients – and senior NHS managers in some areas of the country have admitted the situation is the worst in living memory.

The figures show A&E units are already under considerable pressure even though winter is barely under way. The crisis is partly due to bed-blocking, where elderly patients stay in hospital despite being fit for discharge because of a lack of care for them at home.

In addition, record numbers of patients are visiting A&E because they are unable to get an appointment with their GP.

Separate weekly data shows that 35,373 patients waited more than four hours in A&E – the Government’s target – a record number since data was first published in November 2010.

Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association’s council which represents senior doctors, said: ‘These figures point to a system cracking under extreme pressure, leading to unacceptable delays in care.

‘While the NHS is used to seeing a spike in demand during winter months, this year it’s experienced a spring, summer and autumn crisis as well, leaving no spare capacity in hospitals as we hit winter.’ 

Last month the Government announced that A&E units would get an extra £700million to avert a winter crisis, a sum that senior doctors described as little more than a ‘sticking plaster’.

Dame Barbara Hakin, NHS England’s National Director of Commissioning Operations blamed the crisis on soaring numbers arriving in A&E and having to be admitted on to hospital wards. 

There were 436,229 attendances last week – up nearly 30,000 on the average typically seen for this time of year.

Dr Peter Carter, Chief Executive and General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Last year’s winter pressures on hospitals and A&E never went away – our health service is now running at capacity all year round, and a bad winter could spell disaster.

‘Staff are working incredibly hard to care for record numbers of patients, but the system is failing both staff and patients.’

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the figures should be a ‘wake-up call’.
