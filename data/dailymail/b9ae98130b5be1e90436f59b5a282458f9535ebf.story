A wealthy Briton splashed out £330,000 pounds on a single round of champagne as he partied with Hollywood stars including Leonardo DiCaprio at the Monaco Grand Prix.

Charles Shaker, a British entrepreneur and adviser to the ultra wealthy, forked out the fortune on an extremely rare Armand de Brignac Brut Gold 'Dynastie' collection of champagne.

The extravagant buy was ordered at the exclusive 'Armand de Brignac Gold Party' hosted by the Billionaire Club Monaco.

According to an eyewitness, it took a procession of 12 waiting staff to carry the nine-bottle collection through the club. 

This included a Midas bottle, which holds a huge 30-litres of champagne, and alone required four men to carry it in a custom-made gold 'Roman Litter' champagne bucket.

The stunned partygoer said: 'Everyone was dancing, when the music suddenly stopped.

The Armand de Brignac Dynastie collection consists of nine different Armand de Brignac Brut Gold bottle sizes:

'The DJ then came on the mic and congratulated Charles Shaker on "buying the world's first Armand de Brignac Dynastie Collection".

'We then saw what seemed like a spectacular, never-ending stream of gold bottles being bought through the club - all different sizes.

'The club went crazy, everyone was trying to take pictures, cheering and clapping.

'Shaker's table then started opening bottles and waiters were pouring champagne for everyone.

'It was an amazing night.'

The Billionaire's Club is one of the most glamorous venues in Monaco and is often frequented by top Hollywood A-listers, famous singers and super-rich businessman.

The nightclub has sweeping views over the luxurious resort of Monte Carlo, which is renowned for its playground status of the rich and famous.

Samy Sass and Flavio Briatore, founders of the Billionaire Club Monaco, also congratulated him on the record-breaking evening, the eyewitness said.

Hollywood actor Leonard DiCaprio was also in the club at the time, they said, along with Italian businessman Flavio Briatore.

According to Armand de Brignac, the Dynastie collection consists of nine different Brut Gold Champagne bottle sizes.

It includes every available bottle format, from the standard 750ml bottle to the exclusive and world-record breaking 30L Midas.

Collectively it amounts to 109 bottles of the luxury Champagne.

The record-breaking Midas bottle, which weighs over 100lb and is equivalent to 40 standard-sized bottles, is the same as that bought in London by businessman and entrepreneur Don Johnson for £120,000 in June 2011.

The collection is also listed for $500,000 at Hakkasan Las Vegas, the five-level culinary and nightlife mecca at MGM Grand Hotel and Casino.
