A student scrawled ‘take my organs’ on her wrist before killing herself with a lethal dose of cocaine, an inquest heard.

Former grammar schoolgirl Shruti Baral, 22, had battled depression despite appearing outwardly happy and left a desperate final message on Facebook.

She uploaded a picture of herself with a farewell note asking her followers if they would remember her if she died.

Tragic: Shruti Baral took her own life, a coroner has ruled. She had been battling with depression and suffered from social anxiety but appeared outwardly happy. She was also not in the habit of taking drugs

Ms Baral was found dead by her brother Satchet, 17, on the floor of her bedroom at their detached home in Maidstone, Kent.

The inquest, which was held in Maidstone, heard that he was the one who spotted her dying wish on her wrist.

Coroner Patricia Harding was told that Shruti, originally from Hong Kong, was not in the habit of taking drugs.

She was a former pupil at Invicta Girls' Grammar School and was studying Geography at university in London.

She had been to see the university’s psychological services before her death.

Pathologist Dr David Rouse said Ms Baral died from a fatal level of cocaine. Tests also found a small amount of alcohol in her blood.

The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide.
