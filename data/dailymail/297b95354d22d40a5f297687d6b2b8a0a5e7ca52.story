Roadside human advertising is not always the most attention-grabbing way to promote your product - unless you hire this guy.

This man is seen signspinning on the side of the road at an undisclosed location in the U.S. and it appears he found a way to pass the time.

The video was recorded by professional dancer Marquese 'Nonstop' Scott who was driving past with his agent when they spotted this talented spinner - and proceeded to dance with him on camera.

Spinning around: The video begins with the young signspinner holding an arrow-shaped sign as a dubstep song plays in the background

The young man is seen standing by the side of the road with what appears to be a blanked out yellow sign bobbing his head to a dubstep beat.

He then throws himself into an advanced signspinning routine, throwing the sign in the air, spinning it behind his back and flipping it with his feet.

Mr Scott published the video on his YouTube channel which has 360,000 subscribers and the video is spreading online.

Signspinning has gone from a menial task of smiling, waving and holding an arrow-shaped advertising sign, to skillful street art performances.

Here we go: The man spins the advertising board in the air as he begins his routine

Spin my sign: In a series of incredible moves the man throws the board in the air, spins it behind his back, flips in back and forth as cars and lorries drive past

Good ad: Whether you are interested in the product he is selling or not - the show is certainly eye-catching

Spin, span, spun: Jumping up in the air, he throws the board into a spin above his head

Professional signspinners use their sign
as a prop in their performance, throwing it in the air, flipping and 
spinning it like a giant pizza above their heads.

Performers spend years in training go get the spin on their ‘signflipping’ and many compete against eachother.

There are online communities offering everything from training videos, forums and ‘signspinning job agencies’.

Breaking down: As the unnamed talent takes a rest he is joined by Marquese 'Nonstop' Scott who shows off his locking and popping skills
