Arriving home to find a stranger's car parked outside is a persistent problem which has driven John Anderson up the wall.

So, to prove his point, the angry homeowner has painted yellow lines all over the one at the front of his cottage.

While it is yet to be seen whether the extraordinary tactic will help to deter other drivers from leaving their cars outside, the new paintwork has certainly raised eyebrows in his neighbourhood.

Not on my doorstep: So fed up with cars parked outside his front door, John Anderson painted double yellow lines on his £165,000 cottage last week

Mr Anderson, 48, an engineer from 
Coundon, Coventry, now says he will not paint over the lines until the 
council agrees to put a resident's permit bay outside for him to use.

'I'm at work all day and then turn up
at midnight and I'm having to drive half way round the village to find 
somewhere to park,' he added.

'I had to park a quarter of a mile away from my house the other day.

'The lines will stay put until we can
get it resolved. Then I can have my nice white cottage back again.' Mr 
Anderson, who has lived in the £160,000 two-bedroom home for 25 years, 
claims the problem started in 2011 when the council narrowed one end of 
the street, making it impossible to park on both sides.

Disagrees with paint job: Mr Anderson decided to take matters into his own hands after the council repainted the parking double yellow lines but stopped short of his front door

Yellow lines were then painted on the
road but the section in front of his home was left out - meaning it is 
now one of the few spots in the immediate area on which motorists can 
legally park.

Three weeks ago the lines were repainted, making the problem worse, he says.

As well as complaining to the 
council, Mr Anderson last week decided to take more drastic action - 
painting an arc of yellow lines across the front of his cottage, as well
as a bright yellow exclamation mark by the front door.

He said: 'Parking hasn't been a 
problem until a few years ago and it's got worse. It's a hassle and time
consuming and not ideal when it's dark. We deserve our own place to 
park.

'We've been to ward meetings and it's
been suggested we park on the other side of the village. We don't just 
need parking restrictions, we need residents' parking permits.

Parking permit: Mr Anderson says he will get rid of the yellow lines when the council gives residents parking permits now that it is so difficult to find a park

'The lines will stay put until we can
hold talks with the council about having these permits and maybe we can
get it resolved.' Neighbour Thelma Anderson, 66, has also complained of
strangers parking outside her home on Butcher's Lane.

She added: 'There are times I'm coming home and I'm worried about whether I can get a space on my street.

'I've been able to park outside my 
home or further up the street before and it's been fine but now I have 
to try and find somewhere else. It's quite frightening at night.

'Not everyone can have parking 
outside their home but the reason we moved here is because we knew we 
could park on this street. It's not always the case anymore.'

Coventry City Council said yellow 
lines were needed because when they were not there in the past emergency
services were restricted by congestion on the road.

A spokeswoman added: 'We are well aware of the difficulties parking in Butcher's Lane, which is a narrow road.

'If residents want to apply for a permit scheme for the road it would be considered.'
