Call it a Christmas miracle, or a stroke of absolute luck, but a dying Alabama man believes a stray dog he picked up on the street has helped him fight off incurable cancer and live to see Christmas.

Doctors told 84-year-old Bill Hogencamp, of Phenix, that wouldn't see December 25 this year after being diagnosed with cancer of the gall bladder, liver, colon and the lining of his abdomen in May.

And he accepted his fate.

'I have seven children and I've traveled all around the world,' Hogencamp told ABC News.

'I thought, if this is it, then this is it.'

Cured: Father-of-seven Bill Hogencamp, 84, was told he wouldn't see out the year after being diagnosed with cancer of the gall bladder, liver, colon and lining of his abdomen, but he believes a dog his wife picked up off the street, who they called Mahjong, saved him.

But Hogencamp and his wife, Kathy, made the decision to still try and fight.

In October he had surgery to remove three large tumors.

After the surgery, Kathy went to pick up her husband from a rehabilitation center, she noticed a dog dangerously wandering down the road.

Kathy, and some other cars, slowed down so as to not hit the pup.

But after walking past several cars, he came up to hers and put his paws up on her door.

She opened the door and let the dog get in, the continued to get her husband.

However he was not happy that she decided to take in a stray.

'I hadn't had a dog in twenty years and I had no desire to have a dog,' Hogencamp said.

'I kept saying we need to find his owner.' 

A long subsequent search yielded a no answers, and while a vet told the couple the Maltese had been fixed, he was not micro-chipped.

Savior: The Hogencamp family say it's as if Mahjong knew he had to help them

They had little option but to keep the dog, and named him Mahjong after Kathy's favorite card game, which is similar to solitaire. 

Mahjong fell in love with Hogencamp and rarely left his side.

He would jump on Hogencamp's lap at any chance and fall alseep with him during naps.

Hogencamp then chose to undergo chemotherapy as a further attempt to rid his bodies of the tumors.

Incredibly, doctors later informed the shocked couple that tests had deemed Hogencamp cancer-free.

'My life has been a miracle,' Hogencamp said. 

'And now Mahjong is part of that miracle.'

Hogencamp and his wife believe Mahjong found them in a time of need, and somehow understood it was his responsibility to help the man fight cancer.

'The dog seemed to know right away that Bill was sick and it was his job to take care of him -- and Bill knew it was his job to take care of the dog,' Kathy Hogencamp told ABC.
