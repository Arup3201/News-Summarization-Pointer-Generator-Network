A glamorous Manhattan socialite is spending Christmas behind bars after being sentenced to 30 days for stealing a designer sweater with a price tag of more than $5,000.

Stefanie Lackner, 46, a realtor married to the CEO of Fisher Island Club resort Bernard Lackner, pleaded guilty last week to misdemeanor petit larceny in connection to a shoplifting incident that took place in August 2012 at the high-end Madison Avenue boutique Brunello Cuccinelli.

According to court documents, Mrs Lackner entered the store located a few blocks from her office at the real estate firm Douglas Elliman and picked up a sweater priced at $5,135.

The blonde real estate agent initially took the garment to a fitting room to try it on. She then requested the sweater in a different size while holding onto the original.

The criminal complaint cited by the New York Post states that when Lackner emerged from the dressing room, she was carrying only one sweater, but a black shopping bag she had in her possession was noticeably bulging.

The crime was described by a police officer who reviewed surveillance footage from inside the store.

'The defendant did then exit the store without paying for the remaining sweater,' the court papers state. 

Mrs Lackner was arrested in November 2012 and initially faced a charge of felony grand larceny, which was later downgraded as part of a plea deal.

When contacted by the Post for comment, Lackner's manager at Douglas Elliman said he was not aware of the broker's legal troubles.

All references to Lackner have since been removed from the real estate firmâ€™s website, suggesting that she may have been let go.

According to its website, Douglas Elliman is the largest residential real estate brokerage in the New York metropolitan area and the fourth largest real estate company in the U.S. employing 4,000 agents.

Mrs Lackner has a child with her hotelier husband, 59, but the couple are reportedly no longer living together.

Bernard Lackner was appointed last year the chief executive officer of the swanky hotel and resort complex Fisher Island in Miami Beach where suites cost more than $1,000 a night.

The Lackners own a mansion valued at $1.2million in Southampton - but for the next three weeks the sticky-fingered realtor will be calling the Rikers Island jail home.
