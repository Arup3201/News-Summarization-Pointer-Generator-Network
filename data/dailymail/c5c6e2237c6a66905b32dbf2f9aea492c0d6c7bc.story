Liam Angel struck the winner as Wales opened their Sky Sports Victory Shield campaign with a win over England in Bangor.

The Cardiff City youngster swept the ball home during a goalmouth scramble after England goalkeeper Taye Ashby-Hammond's punch failed to clear the danger from a 43rd-minute corner.

Despite controlling much of the possession, England's Young Lions couldn't find a way back into the contest in gale-force winds and driving rain by the Menai Strait in north-west Wales.

The result meant a losing start for new England Under 16 coach Steve Cooper as the team seek to continue their dominance of the competition this century.

It was a scrappy opening at the Book People Stadium, with Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount enjoying the best chance when his free-kick flew over the crossbar.

At the other end, Wales had their best chance when Tyler Roberts played through Matty Smith, only for the Manchester City teenager to fire just wide of the right-hand post.

Ben Woodburn did hit the target for Wales just after the half-hour but was denied by an offside flag.

The hosts were handed a massive let-off just before half-time when their keeper, Scott Coughlan, parried the ball straight out to Tottenham's Keanan Bennetts who conspired to shoot wide from just five yards.

Conditions deteriorated in the second half as heavy rain made it difficult for the players to gain a foothold and this thwarted England's attempts to get back into the game after Angel's scrambled goal.

England threw on Newcastle's Mackenzie Heaney, Man City's Sadou Diallo and Liverpool's Okera Simmonds as they searched for the equaliser but it didn't arrive.

Cooper and his squad now have to re-group ahead of next Friday's match with Northern Ireland in Dungannon before they finish their campaign against holders Scotland at Yeovil's Huish Park on November 20.
