Anti-rape campaigners today slammed adverts for a minicab firm featuring a vulnerable-looking woman caught in a downpour.

The use of the image on 200,000 promotional postcards which say ‘Should have used Data Cars’ has attracted criticism - but the company insists it merely shows a woman caught out by the weather.

Les Chapman, manager of Data Cars in Lewisham, south-east London, said his inspiration for the campaign came from seeing his teenage daughters coming home from a night out looking drenched.

Controversial: The use of the image on 200,000 promotional postcards which say 'Should have used Data Cars' has attracted criticism - but the company insists it merely shows a woman caught out by the weather

Postcard: The firm's message signed off with the mock address: 'A. Muchbetter, 5 Ervice, Than, NE1 ELS'

But Rape Crisis said the advertising was ‘a really unfortunate and misguided piece of advertising’.

Katie Russell from the charity said: ‘The best case scenario, giving the company the benefit of the doubt, is that they're not aware of the associations that the image on this postcard conjures.

‘The worst case scenario is that they've knowingly used scare-mongering, sexist and victim-blaming imagery and messaging in a cynical marketing ploy.’

When the postcard was sent out it started a wave of outrage, with angry comments left on the Data Cars Twitter feed and complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority and Transport for London.

Complaint: One Twitter user said shadows on the girl's body resembled bruising and she looked in distress

However Mr Chapman said: ‘The way we viewed the image, it is simply a girl who has gone out on a hot summer evening and the predicable British weather has opened the heavens and she got soaking wet.

‘This is something we see every year and this year we decided to place an advertising campaign with this in mind.’

He said the wording on the back of the postcard makes it clear, saying: ‘You should look just as great coming home as you did going out, so don't gamble on the weather... get a Data Cars minicab.’

But one commenter on Twitter said shadows on the girl's body resembled bruising and she looked in some distress, likening it to adverts for Transport for London’s minicab safety campaign Cabwise.

Dee Elms said: ‘Check the bruises on her arms. That's what bothered me. 'Use our cabs - or u gonna get RAPED!’

'It is simply a girl who has gone out on a hot summer evening and the predicable British weather has opened the heavens and she got soaking wet'

However Mr Chapman added: ‘I think in life people see everything in different ways. Most people who have looked at it, I'd say 99.5 per cent, have seen it exactly for what it is.

‘The comments can be frustrating as we promote safety more than any other minicab company in South East London and would obviously apologise if we have offending anyone.’

He said: ‘Data Cars have always been at the forefront with safety ideas and were the first local company to introduce drivers' ID badges way back in the 1990s as well as the first to text the vehicle details of the customer nearly 10 years ago.’
