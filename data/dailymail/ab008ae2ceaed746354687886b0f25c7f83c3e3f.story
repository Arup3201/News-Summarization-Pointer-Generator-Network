Chaos: Packets fall off a crowded conveyor onto cluttered floor at UK Mail depot

Staff at one of Britain's largest courier companies have been secretly filmed dropping, throwing and kicking customers' parcels.

Many of the packages being damaged by workers at UK Mail were labelled 'Fragile' and came from leading internet retailers like Marks & Spencer, Tesco and Dell.

Despite a slogan promising to deliver 'quickly, safely and securely', packages at the depot were seen falling from crowded conveyer belts before being mishandled.

The shocking footage will confirm the fears of many web shoppers that their expensive purchases are being lost and mistreated by private delivery companies.

Across the online shopping industry, problems with deliveries cost businesses an estimated £851million a year.

An undercover reporter for tonight's Channel 4 Dispatches programme saw parcels being mishandled every day at the UK Mail plant in Bournemouth.

One even narrowly missed his head when it was thrown by another worker.

Robert Hammond, from campaign group Consumer Focus, said: 'This shows people quite blatantly, quite openly throwing around items without the least care and consideration.

'This is chaos – as simple as that. There is really no proper management going on in this depot.'

Richard Headland, editor of Which? magazine said: 'A lot of us suspect that this kind of thing goes on. To see footage as graphic as that is quite shocking.'

On another occasion, depot workers were filmed discussing the possibility of selling bottles of wine from a damaged parcel on the internet auction site eBay.

The worker says: 'Hopefully, if they 
say “Oh, can you please dispose of them', then we'll be like... [claps 
hands] straight on eBay.'

Unsupervised: The TV investigation found that there were rarely any managers on the depot floor

The TV investigation found that there were rarely any managers on the depot floor to make sure staff lived up to the firm's pledges.

After viewing the footage, chief executive Guy Buswell apologised to customers and launched an inquiry.

'We need to investigate those clips and see exactly what happened at the time to allow those guys to run amok, which is clearly what they've done,' he said.

'Of course, I'm going to say sorry to the customers affected. We need to investigate it, see what went on, and take a view.

'I'm disappointed with all of it on the basis that we spend an awful lot of time making sure that our staff are well trained.' He added: 'Last year, UK Mail delivered 29 million parcels. I have 486 claims for damage so I would say that clip doesn't really show our business in a true light.'

Ministers plan to privatise Royal Mail this year, meaning that letters could soon also be delivered by private companies. In a pilot scheme starting a year ago in West London, TNT became the first firm to deliver post directly to households. 

Kickabout: A colleague at one of the UK's largest courier companies takes aims at a package

However, another Dispatches reporter working undercover as a TNT postman discovered that he had to leave his bike carrying bundles of mail unattended on busy roads on most days.

He also discovered that the post bags were not securely locked to the bike, meaning letters could easily be stolen.

Bikes were seen unattended around West London as TNT workers delivered the mail, including one bike carrying letters from firms including Barclays and Thames Water which was left for about 30 minutes.

Mr Hammond added: 'Clearly, there's a security angle. Any amount of that post could be easily lifted off the bike and removed. This seems short of the standards that one would expect.'

A TNT spokesman said it was improving the locks on panniers and the way they were attached to the bikes.

Dispatches was also shown evidence of a TNT postman dumping post in a bin in a park. TNT said the culprit has been sacked.

Channel 4's Dispatches: Secrets of Your Missing Mail is screened tonight at 8pm.
