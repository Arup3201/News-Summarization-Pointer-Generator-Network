A former wrestler has today claimed he ripped out clumps of Jimmy Savile's hair during a professional grappling match after the sex abuser boasted about bedding young girls.

Adrian Street, 72, originally from Brynmawr, Wales, says he removed parts of the former Top Of The Tops presenter's scalp and left him covered in bruises during a fight between the pair.

The wrestler said had he known Savile was a sex offender when the pair met in 1971, he would have given him a 'bigger hiding.'

Savile took part in over a hundred matches as a semi-pro wrestler.

Street, who now runs a wrestling shop in Florida, told WalesOnline that promoters were trying to put Savile across as a tough guy and were attempting to get him to fight with professional wrestlers.

The man, known for his flamboyant costumes when he was competing, said: 'It was all part of some big stupid gimmick.

'But
 I was having none of it. I kicked his legs from underneath him, then I 
picked him up by his hair, held him upside down and dropped him on his 
skull.

'Then when I looked down at my hands, I realised they were covered in hair – Savile’s. I’d torn huge clumps out of his scalp.'

The wrestler added that when they met in 1971, Savile would frequently talk about how young girls would wait for him outside his dressing room.

He added: 'All the fighters on the circuit used to boast about their conquests. But Savile used to go on and on about the young girls who’d wait in line for him outside his dressing room.

'He’d pick the ones he wanted and say to the rest: "Unlucky, come back again tomorrow night."

'Had I known then what I know about him now, I’d have given him an even bigger hiding.'

Today, the former director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer said that failing to report allegations of child sexual abuse should be made a criminal offence in Britain.

Mr Starmer believes it is time to 'change the law' and said it should be 'mandatory' to report allegations in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Speaking on BBC Panorama, Mr Starmer said: 'I think the time has come to change the law and close a gap that's been there for a very long time. I think there should be a mandatory reporting provision.

'The problem is if you haven't got a central provision requiring people to report, then all you can do is fall back on other provisions that aren't really designed for that purpose and that usually means they run into difficulties.

'What you really need is a clear, direct law that everybody understands.'
