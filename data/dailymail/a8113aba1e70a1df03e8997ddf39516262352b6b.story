Click here to read Matt Lawton's special investigation as Malky Mackay and Iain Moody are investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff 

Rio Ferdinand became the latest star to cast judgement on the League Managers Association's statement which was released on behalf of Malky Mackay on Thursday.

The Queens Park Rangers defender took to Twitter to question the statement, which described Mackay's sexist, racist and homophobic messages as 'friendly text message banter'

Ferdinand tweeted: 'Who wrote the #LMA statement???'.

Unacceptable: Stan Collymore believes the LMA statement was 'f****** disgraceful'

Institutional acceptance: Former Liverpool and England striker Collymore was unhappy with the LMA statement

In the statement Mackay apologised for sending messages he admits were 'disrespectful of other cultures', but he said he would fully co-operate with any official investigation after Cardiff sent a dossier to the Football Association detailing a number of issues during his stay in south Wales.

Mackay and Iain Moody were sacked by the club last season and the Welsh club have sent a dossier to the Football Association alleging misconduct.

The statement said that Mackay had been under pressure at the time of the messages and that he was 'letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter.'

Elsewhere, former England striker Stan Collymore has described the LMA's statement as being 'f****** disgraceful'.

He said on Twitter: 'LMA statement. F****** disgraceful. Institutional acceptance of the "banter" of casual racism.'

He does feel Mackay deserves a second chance, though, adding: 'Always kind to me, hope he says sorry (if true), and moves on.'

Another former player who has worked closely on eliminating discrimination, Jason Roberts, tweeted excerpts from the LMA's statement and then said: 'That's it..I'm done for the evening..The LMA said it better than I ever could.. They are actually being serious! Somebody drafted that..WOW!'

Opinion: Former Wigan and Reading striker Roberts shares his views via Twitter

Former Football League player and manager Leroy Rosenior has also had his say, revealing he's disappointed with the LMA's use of the term 'banter'.

He told the BBC: 'If the LMA are going back into the dark ages to support people then I might have to withdraw my support. 

'If Malky did use a couple of texts, as he admits to in the statement, then I'm disappointed and I think it needs to be dealt with not as something swept over or as a bit of banter.

'I know they (LMA) are trying to protect their member but in doing so I feel they are almost abusing another member, like myself.'

The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC.

In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete.

The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise.

Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC.

Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter.

Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others.

Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.
