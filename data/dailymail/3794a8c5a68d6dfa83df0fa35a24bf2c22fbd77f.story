The U.S. Ambassador to Syria has blamed the country's government for attacks on civilians and has taken the unusual step of posting a military aerial photograph on Facebook to back his claims.

Robert Ford spoke angrily about the killings of unarmed civilians in Syria's third-largest city of Homs after uploading the detailed aerial image showing army vehicles in residential neighbourhoods.

Speaking from Paris after he closed the U.S. Embassy in Damascus earlier this week, he called on the country's Government to end the bombardment of civilians.

The U.S. State Department also piled on the pressure by releasing further images showing the Syrian regime's artillery deployed around the country. More than 300 civilians have died in Homs in the past week alone.

He said: 'I've spent a good part of the day 
looking at what's happening in Syria and the shelling again by Syrian 
forces on residential areas of Syria's third-largest city of Homs is 
absolutely awful, it's horrific.

'We want that government violence to stop before Syria goes off a cliff,' he told NBC.

Speaking about his Facebook posts, he said: 'The Syrian government's claims that terrorists are shelling parts of Homs are completely ridiculous. We know who is shelling Homs.

'We know that and I do not want the Syrian government selling a propaganda scheme to try to hide the truth.'

First, like people around the world, my 
colleagues and friends are watching the video coming out of Homs and 
some of the other Syrian cities in the last days with horror and 
revulsion. 

I hear the devastating stories about newborns in Homs dying 
in hospitals where electricity has been cut and when we see disturbing 
photos offering proof that the regime is using mortars and artillery 
against residential neighborhoods, all of us become even more concerned 
about the tragic outcome for Syrian civilians.

The Arab League protocol,
which received wide support from the international community, called 
for the Syrian military to withdraw from residential areas, to stop 
firing at peaceful protests and to release prisoners arrested due to the
unrest. 

The film coming out of Homs and elsewhere in Syria shows the 
Syrian government's real response. 

And we have never heard of the armed
opposition firing artillery for example. 

It is odd to me that anyone 
would try to equate the actions of the Syrian army and armed opposition 
groups since the Syrian government consistently initiates the attacks on
civilian areas, and it is using its heaviest weapons. 

'I hope they [the people of Syria] do not feel abandoned because the international community is coming together more and more.

'The government of Syria needs to respect basic human rights and it needs to allow a peaceful political transition to go forward.'

On the decision to close the embassy on February 6, he said: 'Very frankly, it was very hard to take 
down the American flag for the last time from the American Embassy, it 
is a symbol of our presence, it is a symbol of our engagement in a 
country like Syria.'

Gunmen assassinated an army general in Damascus today in the first killing of a high ranking military officer in the Syrian capital since the uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime began in March.

Three gunmen were reported to have opened fire at Brig. Gen. Issa al-Khouli in the morning as he left his home in the Damascus neighborhood of Rukn-Eddine.

Al-Khouli was a doctor and the chief of a military hospital in the capital. No one claimed responsibility for the killing.

The attack indicates that violence in Syria is reaching the tightly controlled capital, which has been relatively quiet compared to other cities.

Such assassinations are not uncommon outside Damascus and army officers have been killed in the past, mostly in the restive provinces of Homs and Idlib.

This morning activists claimed President  Assad's forces killed at least four civilians in an intensified tank and rocket bombardment on opposition districts in Homs.

'This is the most violent barrage since the attack on Homs started six days ago. The four included a 55-year old woman.

'They were killed by shelling that hit a building where they live in Bab Amro,' opposition activist Mohammad Hassan said. 

Footage posted online showed a doctor at a field hospital in Bab Amro next to the body of the woman, who appeared to have been hit in the head.   

'This is Ibtissam al-Dalati, mother of three...Shrapnel hit her in the head,' the doctor says, holding the woman's fractured and bloody head.

'I call upon all Syrians to take to the streets to take the pressure off Homs.'

Pressure: The U.S. State Department has issued satellite pictures, showing Syrian artillery strategically deployed towards the city of Homes

Western diplomat have warned Syrian officials involved in the brutal suppression of the anti-regime protests will eventually be held accountable for their actions.

Efforts are under way in Western capitals to assemble evidence of human rights abuses by members of president Bashar al Assad's regime with a view to use in future proceedings.

Referral to the International Criminal Court would require the authorisation of the United Nations Security Council - currently seen as unlikely given the opposition of Russia and China.

However Western officials insist that eventually those Syrians responsible for atrocities against the civilian population could still be brought to book.

Weaponry: Intelligence analysts said the images show heavy weaponry being deployed for use against civilians in or near the Syrian cities of Az Zabadani, Halbun, Rankus and Homs

Steps are already under way within 
the European Union to impose travel bans and asset freezes on named 
Syrian officials - a move which could translate into further action at a
later date.

'It is 
important that Syrian senior regime officials understand that even if 
they are out of reach today there may come a point down the line when 
they will be held accountable,' said one Western diplomat.

'A
lot of these mid-ranking officials, they don't have significant assets 
and within the EU jurisdiction they are probably not going to travel 
much.

Anger: Robert Ford called on Syria to stop the killing of civilians

'But mainly it shows that a list of names that at the moment is a list of people who are not allowed to travel to the EU can very easily become another kind of list of names in another form further down the line.'

Officials admit they see little hope of breaking the current cycle of violence, with the regime now apparently firmly locked in to a 'security solution'.

'With the amount of blood that has been spilt the regime is now committed to this process, it can't back up. There is too much blood spilt. It is a cul-de-sac,' said one diplomat.

'They will either succeed by force of arms or they will lose.'

Bloodshed: More than 300 people including this man have died in Homs in the past week

Despite the frustration, there was caution about calls from some in the Syrian opposition for the international community to establish safe havens or humanitarian corridors through which aid can pass.

Officials warned of the dangers of sending in aid workers without adequate protection.

'It is important not to engage in wishful thinking about what you can do if you are not going to do the whole thing, otherwise you end up in mid-1990s and Bosnia,' said one diplomat.

Meanwhile, 28 people have been killed and 235 wounded in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, according to the country's Health Ministry.

Syrian media reported that the fatalities were caused by two explosions near security compounds in the northern city yesterday.

State television blamed 'terrorists' for the blasts, following the regime line that armed groups looking to destabilise Syria are behind the uprising.

But opposition activists accused Mr Assad's regime of setting off the blasts.

More than 5,400 people have been killed since the uprising began in March last year.

Foreign Secretary William Hague has said that Britain has no plans to arm Syrian rebels trying to overthrow the president.

David Cameron has pledged to maintain the pressure on Mr Assad and his government, saying he was determined to see the 'toughest possible response' to the brutality.

UN chief Ban Ki-moon has condemned the 'appalling brutality' of the onslaught.
