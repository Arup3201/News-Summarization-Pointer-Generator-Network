At first glance, Frankie is just an ordinary everyday pug. Pudgy face, cute skin rolls and a breathless little grunt that makes him all the more adorable. But then nature calls.

Frankie is the star of a new video in which he takes going for a wee to the next level. 

The three-year-old, believed to be owned by Olga Ostashinskaya, is filmed outside his home in Russia on his two front paws doing a remarkable paw-stand while he pees.

He stands to pee: Frankie the pug dog goes to the toilet in a particularly acrobatic matter, on his two front paws

In the video, Frankie stays on his front paws for no less than 67 seconds while keeping  a steady stream flowing. He walks around the concrete yard, anything but camera shy as his owner films. 

Paw-stand peeing is nothing new for pugs, one of the quirks of the beloved breed from from China to Europe in the 16th century, but few are as impressive as Frankie. 

'His owner says no one taught him how to do it and that it has been a habit with him since he was a pup,' says the YouTube post. 

'While she and her children are used to seeing it, Frankie's peeing technique never fails to put a smile on the face of bystanders every time they take him for a walk.' 

Frankie's epic leek starts innocently enough, with the traditional leg-cocking technique on the curb 

But in one smooth move Frankie, who is three and lives in Russia, is on his two front paws

And he keep that pose while peeing for an incredible 67 seconds before a third paw touches the ground

While his circus skills are admirable, unfortunately his front legs can't hold out as long as his bladder can produce its core product. 

When Frankie's legs give way at the end of the video, and with no standard leg-cocking technique at his disposal, the little guy simple pees on his front foot. 

After all that effort!
