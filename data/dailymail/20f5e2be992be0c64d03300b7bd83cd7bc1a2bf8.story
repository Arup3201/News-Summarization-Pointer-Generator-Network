A collection of English seaside postcards collected by German tourists before the Second World War, confiscated by Hitler and used to plan the Nazi invasion of Britain have recently been unearthed.

The black and white images of coastal beauty spots were originally taken home by families as mementoes of their visit to the island.

After the outbreak of war in 1939 the German military machine collected thousands of the postcards as Adolf Hitler plotted to conquer Britain.

Lucky escape: This postcard, showing the sleepy 
Cornish fishing town of Porthleven, formed part of Hitler's invasion 
plan of Britain, dubbed 'Operation Sealion'

Once the German Blitzgreig of Holland, Belgium and France was over, they planned to invade Britain in 'Operation Sealion.'

Postcards and holiday snaps of the English seaside helped the Nazi high command identify suitable beaches to assault and help their troops recognise landmarks.

The images were contained alongside annotated maps of the UK in eight booklets called Militargeographische Angaben uber England - Military Geographical information about England.

The booklets were broken down into eight regions of Britain and were incredibly detailed, highlighting things like strategic locations to attack to the make up of soil.

Areas of the low-level beaches that were ideal for an invasion landing were circled and a reference number appeared alongside to draw the reader to corresponding photos.

Local municipal institutions like police stations and train stations were highlighted in red triangles and industrial sites such as factories were shown up in purple.

The plans also detailed potentional weak spots the Germans could exploit, such as low-level areas of London that could be flooded.

A military historian and author has since collected the booklets and is now selling them at auction.

The Nazis collected thousands of postcards to build up a picture of Great Britain. From there they could highlight areas of weakness, recognise landmarks and get an idea of the country's defences. After the blitzkrieg of Holland, Belgium and France, Hitler saw Britain as the final piece of the jigsaw to military domination across Europe

Max Haslar, of London-based Dreweatts auctioneers, said: 'These briefing booklets were printed in preparation for Operation Sealion, the German invasion of Britain which thankfully never came to pass.

'This is probably the most extensive collection of these booklets to come up at auction.

'They were used by the German military and the Luftwaffe during the war and illustrate places and road junctions in the UK that German intelligence thought should be attacked as part of the British invasion.

'Along with maps and photographs, the booklets detail particular regions and sites to be besieged, including major London train stations and industrial areas.

'The collection gives us a very real indication of the extensive knowledge German Military had of the British Isles. 

'Maps of the south coast include soil composition for potential landing places and profile views of the coastline and cliffs come in the form of old postcards and aerial photos.'

The booklets are expected to sell for 600 pounds at the auction tomorrow (Weds).

Although most people remember the 
Blitz in all it's horror, one often forgotten part of world war two 
history is the Baedeker raids.

The Nazis moved focus away from major cities starting in March 1942, instead concentrating their efforts on picturesque seaside towns and cities.
