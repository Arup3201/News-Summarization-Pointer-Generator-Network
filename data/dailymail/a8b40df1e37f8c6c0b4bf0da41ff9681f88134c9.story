Germany's Marcel Siem claimed his fourth European Tour title in dramatic fashion in a three-man play-off for the BMW Masters in Shanghai on Sunday.

Siem missed from six feet on the 72nd hole to win in regulation, but made amends by chipping in for a winning birdie when the players returned to the 18th for the first hole of sudden death.

Ross Fisher and Alexander Levy both had birdie chances to keep their hopes alive but were unable to convert, meaning Levy had squandered a four-shot lead at Lake Malaren.

Rounds of 65, 66 and 63 had seemingly put the in-form Frenchman in total command, taking the 24-year-old to a collective 40 under par for his last five stroke play rounds following his recent win in the Portugal Masters.

However, with a strong wind making scoring conditions difficult, Levy could only manage a closing 78 to finish alongside playing partner Siem, who shot 73, and Fisher on 16 under par.

Fisher had set the clubhouse target after a superb 67 and then saw Levy and Siem both bogey the 18th, Siem missing from six feet for the title with Levy already certain to drop a shot after almost pulling his approach into the water.

The third member of the final group, Ryder Cup star Jamie Donaldson, had a birdie chance on the 18th to get into the play-off, but left it inches short.

And Gleneagles team-mate Justin Rose finished alongside Donaldson on 15 under after a bogey on the same hole in a closing round of 72. 

Alexander, attempting a chip from the bunker, was hoping to make it a third win of the season but just fell short
