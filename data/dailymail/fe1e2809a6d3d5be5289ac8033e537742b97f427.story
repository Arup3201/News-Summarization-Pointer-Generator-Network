Adam Robinson, 21, has been accused of having six sexual encounters with a 13 year old girl over the course of a week in a Californian motel

A British man has been charged with sexual assault after he flew to America to allegedly meet a 13-year-old girl it is claimed he groomed over the internet, it has emerged today.

Adam Robinson, 21, has been accused of having six sexual encounters with the teenager over the course of a week in a Californian motel.

It is believed he met the girl in an online chat room.

He is said to have struck up a relationship with her over the last year before flying out to meet her.

Robinson, from Fleet, in Hampshire, arrived in the US on December 15,  according to local police, and had been waiting to see her again on ­Thursday when police arrested him at the Good Nite Inn motel.

The girl turned 14 on Christmas Eve.

The teenager’s parents are believed to have raised the alarm after hearing about the 'relationship.'

He has been charged with 'a lewd act' with the girl twice on the first occasion they met and another four times on the day before she became 14.

It is believed both of their meetings happened at the motel in the Redwood area of California.

Robinson is now being held in West Valley Detention Center in the suburban city of Rancho Cucamonga, San Bernardino.

His bail has been set at £620,000 and he faces a lengthy prison sentence if found guilty.

He is scheduled to appear tomorrow at the county’s superior court.

Redlands Police detective Andy Capps told the Sunday Mirror: 'Evidence was recovered from the motel room and vehicle linking Robinson to the victim. Robinson had established an online relationship with the victim over the past year and flew to California on December 15.'

The detective added they they were interested to speak with any other minors in the area that may have been ­contacted by him on the internet.

'We have no reason to believe that there are other victims, but there may be. The guy came a long way for this.'

Special agents from the Department of Homeland Security helped with the investigation and they are looking into possible child sexual tourism charges against Robinson.

Child sex tourism is defined as the commercial sexual exploitation of children by men or women who travel from one place to another and engage in sexual acts with children.
