Cardiff City have named Crystal Palace legend Dougie Freedman as the man who blew the whistle on  their spying storm.

In a five-page letter delivered to the Premier League on Thursday, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer alleged that  Freedman, now Bolton boss, was accidentally sent a text by Palace’s sporting director Iain Moody containing the Cardiff team in the days before the clubs met on April 5.

Cardiff City maintain that Aron Gunnarsson has done nothing wrong after he was included in their ‘spygate’ complaint to the Premier League.

A five-page letter sent to the Premier League is believed to include a text message that Cardiff claim was sent by Crystal Palace director of football Iain Moody – a text which allegedly named midfielder Gunnarsson as the source of team information ahead of Palace’s 3-0 earlier this month.

The message from Moody is understood to have read: ‘Straight from Gunnarsson their line up is 4-4-2 Marshall, KTC, Caulker, Turner, Taylor, Daehli, Medel, Mutch, Zaha, Campbell, Jones’.

Gunnarsson and his agent, Jerry de Koning, are reported to have denied leaking the information. De Koning has not responded to a Sportsmail request for comment.

And a well-placed Cardiff source told Sportsmail on Thursday: ‘We do not believe Aron supplied this information.’

RIATH AL-SAMARRAI

According to Solskjaer, Freedman — an old
 pal from the days when they took their coaching badges together — 
phoned the Cardiff manager two days before his side’s 3-0 home defeat to
 say Palace knew the team Cardiff would field.

Palace manager Tony Pulis, chairman Steve Parish and Moody will be among those interviewed by Premier League lawyers on Tuesday.

Parish
 is backing Moody, who was sacked by Cardiff last year, while Pulis 
insists he didn’t put pressure on the club’s sporting director to obtain
 the team.

Cardiff are also asking for the result to be set aside.

Solskjaer
 did not register an official complaint on the Thursday afternoon when 
he was told of the alleged spying. Instead he waited until he met Pulis 
in the corridor at Cardiff City Stadium and said words to the effect of:
 ‘Here’s our team — but I guess you already know it.’

Cardiff’s 
complaint includes a text from Moody naming midfielder Aron Gunnarsson 
as the source of the information.

Cardiff claim it reads: ‘Straight from
 Gunnarsson their line up is 4-4-2 Marshall, KTC, Caulker, Turner, 
Taylor, Daehli, Medel, Mutch, Zaha, Campbell, Jones.’

Gunnarsson and 
his agent are reported to have denied passing on the team line-up, while
 a well-placed Cardiff source said: ‘We do not believe Aron 
supplied this information.’

Instead, the club believe a member of 
staff was responsible for leaking the team and claim further that Moody 
attempted to contact at least three of their employees. Moody has 
strenuously denied contacting Cardiff employees.

Moody is friends 
with Enda Barron, a performance analyst fired by Cardiff over another 
matter. Cardiff have minuted a claim Barron spoke to Moody, but he 
refused to agree to it.
