Sometimes in life you'll say things you always wish you could take back, and for Prime Minster Tony Abbott it happened in an empty football stadium in Penrith last year.

It was here on Friday, September 6, 2013, that he gave an interview to SBS World News just before the federal election to reaffirm his party’s pledges to the voters.

When asked by interviewer Anton Enus – an experienced, award-winning broadcaster – a straightforward question about cuts to public broadcasters, his answer was clear and unequivocal.

After SBS World News presenter Anton Enus asked Tony Abbott if there will be any cuts regarding public broadcasters, Mr Abbott's response was an empathic: 'No'

‘I trust everyone has listened to what Joe Hockey has said, last week and again this week: no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST, and, no cuts to the ABC or SBS,’ was Abbott's no-nonsense reply. 

The sound bite lasted just over 10 seconds, but it’s one that his political adversaries have used relentlessly against him since as it became increasingly apparent that, like many politicians before him, he would not be able to keep his word. 

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the SBS website clip has now been shared on Facebook more than 8000 times. While YouTube videos of the promises have been viewed more than 110,000 times, spiking sharply after the May budget and continuing to rise. 

Labor has also mixed the interview into its 'You'll Pay for Abbott's Lies' attack ads.

So it came as no surprise when on Wednesday the Communications Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, detailed a $254 million funding cut to the ABC, which means the national broadcaster will receive $5.2 billion over four years, rather than $5.5 billion. The SBS will also have its budget cut by $25.2 million.

Mr Abbott was adamant that public broadcasters would not face cuts from his government

However, Mr Turnbull has defended Abbott's pre-election pledge in Penrith.

In an interview on ABC's 7.30 on Wednesday, Mr Turnbull said that he and Treasurer Joe Hockey had made it clear during the election campaign that cuts had to be made and ‘the ABC and SBS couldn't be exempt and that we would be seeking to address waste and inefficiencies’.

Despite his pledge, Mr Abbott's government has announced a $254 million funding cut to the ABC, and the SBS will have its budget cut by $25.2 million

While Finance Minister Mathias Cormann also backed his leader saying the revised budget did not amount to a significant cut at all because the ABC had escaped ‘efficiency dividends’ for the past 20 years.
