A 'slip-shod' tradesman who fitted a stone mantelpiece that collapsed and crushed a six-year-old girl to death wept in a court dock today as he was jailed for eight months.

Isabella Pritchard - known as Bella - suffered massive head injuries after the heavy stone fireplace installed by Christopher Elmer, 39, of Greenford, west London, crashed on top of her.

The girl, who attended £10,000-a-year Maltman’s Green School in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, was taken to hospital where she died from her catastrophic injuries.

Bella was believed to have been swinging from the mantelpiece when it came away from the wall. Elmer was jailed after a judge branded his work ‘slip-shod’ and said he was ‘guilty of carelessness.’

He had taken shortcuts and only sparingly used adhesive to attach the 13st 8lb (86kg) limestones to the wall, Reading Crown Court in Berkshire heard.

Iain Wicks, prosecuting, said: ‘She [Bella] suffered catastrophic and non-survivable head injuries when a limestone fireplace surround collapsed on top of her, probably as a result of her having swung on it in play.

‘The fatal incident occurred on July 7, 2012, just over eight months after the fire surround had been fitted by this defendant who at the time was a self-employed fireplace fitter.

‘The subsequent investigation into his work on this installation showed a number of shortcomings, amongst which was a reliance purely on adhesive only sparingly applied as the sole means to secure the two uppermost and heaviest stones to the wall.

‘It was these stones, with a combined weight of some 86kg, which fell on Bella Pritchard and which killed her almost instantly.’

Elmer had been employed by fireplace manufacturers Chesneys Ltd as a warehouse operative and driver between 2005 and 2007, the court heard.

In 2007 he handed in his notice and became a self-employed fireplace fitter after shadowing others for just three months. The court heard that there were no instructional courses available in fireplace fitting.

Mr Wicks explained that Beejay Enterprises started building a new home for the Pritchard family in January 2011 in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire.

Bella’s father visited Beacon Fireplaces in Beaconsfield, and chose the Clandon Bolection limestone fireplace for the ground floor formal living room - and Beejay’s contracted Elmer to fit it.

The judge heard that the Clandon Bolection had a substantial mantle shelf and was made from extremely heavy limestone.

Mr
 Wicks said that there were no specific instructions tailored to the 
particular mantelpiece and the workman would have been expected to use 
his own fittings, knowledge and experience.

'Slip-shod' tradesman: Elmer hanged his head and cried as details of the case were outlined

He added: ‘It is self-evident that the fitting of such heavy items requires some expertise and considerable care on the part of the fitter. This is not a task for the unsupervised DIY enthusiast to have a go at.’

Mr Wicks explained that despite there being no industry guidelines or standards as to how a stone fireplace should be fitted, a competent installer should be able to approach each job with ‘sufficient skill and judgement to adopt to the requirements.’

‘In the case of the Clarendon Bolection it should have been self-evident to a competent and careful fitter that the mantelpiece required more that high strength adhesive to ensure a fail-safe bound,’ he said.

The court heard that this would have been achievable by drilling into the back of the mantle so that mechanical fittings could be applied to the fire surround and wall.

Elmer had only used Ardurit, a high strength adhesive, to the mantle and even that was applied sparingly, the court was told.

Laboratory tests carried out at Imperial College London following the tragedy found that if mechanical fixings had been applied to the same mantelpiece it would have required a downforce of 2,290kg to move it, but not cause the collapse.

The prosecution contacted a number of experts as they built up the case against Elmer and they unanimously said that they would not have solely relied on adhesive to secure the mantle in place.

Elmer, who appeared in court wearing a smart grey suit, grey tie and white shirt, hanged his head and cried as details of the case were outlined.

Elmer admitted a Health and Safety Regulation breach on what should have been the first day of his trial earlier this year.

Giuseppina Silvo, defending, said: ‘This is a 39-year-old man who thought he had learned a trade, a trade which was going to be the career for the rest of his life.

‘He will never fit another fireplace again... He understands this has destroyed the Pritchard family’s life and not a day goes by he doesn’t himself think about what happened.

‘The sense of guilt he feels is immense. This is a tragedy of unimaginable proportion.’

The court heard that as a result of the accident Elmer had recently been working as an LGV driver. Judge John Reddihough told him: ‘This is a dreadful tragedy.

‘Your failure to properly and safely to fix a very heavy stone fireplace in the Pritchard family home led to it coming away from the wall and falling on Bella Pritchard, a six year old little girl, killing her.

'The effect of the dreadful events upon her parents and three brothers will last the rest of their lives. There will be a void in their lives'

Judge John Reddihough

‘The effect of the dreadful events upon her parents and three brothers will last the rest of their lives. There will be a void in their lives.

‘As has been said the loss of a life, particularly that of a child, cannot possibly be measured in terms of a sentence that the court imposes upon the person deemed responsible.’

Judge Reddihough branded Elmer’s work ‘slip-shod’ and said he gave no thought to the risks.

On jailing Elmer for eight months and ordering him to pay £1,000 towards costs, he added: ‘It must be made clear to persons that go into homes professing to be a skilled workman and carry out slip-shod and unsafe work that result in death, that they must be punished.’

Bella’s father attended the hearing but did not comment after Elmer had been jailed.

At the time of her death, her headmistress said: ‘She was a very special little girl with an infectious love of life. She will be remembered for her wonderful smile, her laughter and her caring gentle nature.’
