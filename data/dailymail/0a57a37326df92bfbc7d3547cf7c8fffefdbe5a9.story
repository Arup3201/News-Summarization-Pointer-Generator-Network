Kurdish and Hezbollah fighters have been killed in suicide bombings and border clashes with ISIS militants as they fight to stop the extremists from extending their influence across the region.

Funerals were held in Turkey today for Kurdish fighters who were killed in battle near the northern Syria border town of Kobane. The town and its surrounding areas were the scene of heavy fighting this week after ISIS attempted to seize control of the Kurdish-run stronghold.

And Hezbollah has also buried its dead in recent days after numerous fighters were killed defending the loosely patrolled Lebanon-Syria border from ISIS fighters - clashes which left at least eight Hezbollah fighters and dozens of jihadists and Syrian rebels dead.

Islamic State militants captured part of a strategic hill overlooking the southern entrance to the besieged Kurdish town of Kobane on Syria's border with Turkey, despite what appeared to be the most intense airstrikes yet on jihadist forces around the town, by the US-led coalition formed to fight the militants 

At least 30 people have also been killed in two suicide attacks on checkpoints run by Kurdish fighters in Syria's northeastern city of Hasakah.

The northeastern province of Hasakah, which borders Iraq and Turkey, has a population of over one million, 70 per cent Kurd and 30 per cent Arab. Kurds compose around 10 per cent of Syria's 23 million population. They are mainly Sunnis. 

'The attacks targeted checkpoints run by Kurdish fighters on the western entrance of the city. They occurred within minutes of each other,' Rami Abdelrahman from the Observatory for Human Rights said.

For more than three weeks, Syria's Kurds have been engaged in heavy fighting with fighters from the Islamic State group which is trying to seize the border town of Kobani after taking large parts of Syria and Iraq.

On Monday, the radical group raised its black flag on a building on the outskirts of Kobani.

Meanwhile, two rockets have also hit Lebanon in a border region where the country's Hezbollah movement clashed with Syrian jihadists last week. The missiles landed near the eastern Lebanese town of Brital, but did not cause any casualties or injuries.

Lebanon's border with Syria is not officially defined and much of it is porous and unpatrolled, with local residents, smugglers and others moving freely across it.

Hezbollah maintains several military posts along the border and its fighters are also battling jihadists and other Syrian opposition fighters in Syria in a bid to bolster President Bashar al-Assad.

The conflict in Syria has regularly spilled into Lebanon, and raised tensions between Lebanese Sunnis who largely back the uprising and Shiites who tend to support Assad's regime.

Hezbollah's role in the conflict has further stoked tensions, and the group and its strongholds in Lebanon have been targeted in attacks by jihadists on several occasions.

The attack against Hezbollah on Sunday was reportedly launched from around the Assal al-Ward region of Syria's Qalamun region.

Hezbollah sources and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor reported today that jihadists and rebels had launched several attacks against regime forces in Assal al-Ward in the last two days. 

'The situation in the Qalamun mountains is calm now after the failure of all attempts by armed groups,' a Hezbollah source on the group said.

The source said a series of attacks against Assal al-Ward and surrounding areas by rebel groups had been repelled by and 'at least 15 (rebel) gunmen killed.'

The funerals (pictured) were held in Turkey today after the men were killed in clashes with jihadists. Another 30 Kurds died in suicide attacks on Monday
