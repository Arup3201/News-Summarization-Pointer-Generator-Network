The residents of a Welsh village feared they would not be buried alongside their ancestors after a historic graveyard was put up for sale as a domestic garden.

However, a generous farmer and his wife have now stepped in and saved the cemetery - ensuring that future generations of local families will be laid to rest together.

Vince and Elaine Stephens are believed to have spent as much as £100,000 buying the land, which is attached to a disused Protestant chapel in the village of Talgarth, near the Brecon Beacons.

Saved: This graveyard in the Welsh village of Talgarth has been bought by a local farmer

Disused: The Bethania United Reform Church has not been used as a Protestant chapel since 2009

The Bethania United Reform Church was put up for sale earlier this year, after falling into disuse around 2009 when a new church was set up elsewhere in the village.

In the prospectus for the property, prospective buyers were told that although they would have to maintain the graveyard there was no obligation to allow new burials there.

Mr Stephens, 59, whose parents are buried in the cemetery, decided that he should buy it so that villagers could be buried in the same place as their relatives for decades to come.

He and his wife negotiated with the trustees of the chapel to split off the graveyard and buy it separately, for a price believed to be around £100,000.

'The graveyard is an essential part of our community,' Mrs Stephens said. 'My husband's parents are both buried there and he went to Sunday school in the chapel.

'It is an important place for villagers, just about everyone here has someone who is buried there.'

Threat: The graveyard was going to be sold to the new owners of the chapel, who would not have had to allow new burials there

The couple have now put the cemetery into a trust which will ensure that it remains available for the use of the local community.

'The chapel has been closed for a few years and up until we bought it, the graveyard has been closed since July,' Mrs Stephens added.

'We are very pleased to have secured it on behalf of the local people.

'We've had a wonderful reaction from the village. We've had phone calls, cards and been stopped in the street. Everyone is very grateful.'

Mr Stephens, a dairy farmer, said: 'We are pleased with the way it's turned out but we don't want to make a big fuss.

'It means there could be more burials there so people can be laid to rest with their loved ones. It's a family graveyard.'

Trust: Vince and Elaine Stephens have guaranteed the future of the graveyard for decades to come

However, Mr and Mrs Stephens have not yet decided whether or not they will be buried in their own graveyard, as they are regulars at a church elsewhere.

Suzanne Cole, property officer for the United Reformed Church National synod of Wales, said: 'We are pleased to confirm that a local farming family have set up a trust which has purchased the burial ground.

'The declared objects of the group are to manage the land - primarily as a private burial ground.'

The chapel, which was originally founded in the early 19th century and rebuilt in 1891, is being sold at auction with a guide price of £80,000.

It is set to be converted into a four-bedroom family home - but the graveyard will no longer be part of the property.
