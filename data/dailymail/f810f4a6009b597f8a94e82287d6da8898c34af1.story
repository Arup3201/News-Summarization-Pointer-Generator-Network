A bankrupt solicitor who owes more than £52million to a bank was ‘barricaded in’ at his mansion, a court heard.

Brian O’Donnell and his doctor wife Mary Pat – who once controlled a vast global property empire – have fought attempts by Bank of Ireland to recover the millions for the past four years.

At midday on Monday, bank-appointed receiver Tom Kavanagh was due to take possession of Gorse Hill in Killiney, south Dublin, by order of the Supreme Court.

And members of anti-repossession group, the Land League, congregated at the O’Donnells’ south Dublin fortress.

But now O'Donnell has been accused of trespassing on the property as he refused to leave the mansion.

It came after a trespass notice was nailed to the front gate of the mansion by representatives of the receivers and O'Donnell was asked to leave the house immediately.

But in a fresh case by O'Donnell's children, they claim the bank ‘fraudulently’ secured the €70million (£52million) judgment against their parents and therefore the house cannot be seized on foot of that court order, made in December 2011.

Cian Ferriter SC, for the bank, said the O’Donnells’ claims were ‘utterly wild’.

He described the notion of any conspiracy by the bank and its advisers against the family as ‘deluded’.

The court heard that the four offspring had in fact surrendered their rights over their home yesterday morning – but that their father was now occupying the property.

Rossa Fanning, for the receiver, told the court: ‘The property has been barricaded in this afternoon.’

The court heard that in a written statement, Brian O’Donnell had threatened to call gardaí (police) if the bank’s receiver ‘should harass us’.

His statement, read to the court by Mr Ferriter, said: ‘My wife and I have a right of residence in Gorse Hill... Should Tom Kavanagh harass us at the property on March 2, we will call the police.’

Mr Ferriter told the court he understood that protesters from the Land League organisation had ‘erected some sort of barricade at the property’.

He added: ‘We understand a member of the family is in the house, Brian O’Donnell.

‘This is the type of behaviour orchestrated by the O’Donnell family is in the face of what the Supreme Court determined. We are most troubled by that.’

Mr Ferriter pointed out that the couple had previously stated they were permanent residents of London, but were ‘now moving back in’ to the Dublin home.

Blake O’Donnell, 31, told the court the bank was ‘attempting to remove us from the property and seize it’.

He said Bank of Ireland had ‘run our family into the courts to try and get judgments and seize our assets from us.’

Blake added his parents ‘are in occupation of the property at the moment’ and they have a ‘right of residence’. 

He added: ‘Myself and my siblings, we have left. It was in the media we were going to be thrown out of the house and I understand a group of protesters have turned up to protest peacefully.

'This idea people are barricaded in, I don’t know anything about that. I think it’s sensationalism by the media.’

Mr Justice Brian McGovern said he will give his ruling on the fresh lawsuit today.

Meanwhile, at the gates of Brian O’Donnell’s lavish Vico Road home last night, the situation escalated after an intense stand-off between the receivers and campaigners.

Shortly after 6.15pm, a blacked-out eight-seater van pulled up outside Gorse Hill.

Speaking through a small crack in the thick wooden gates and high walls, Tom Kavanagh, a receiver from Kavanagh Fennell, asked Land League campaigners who they were.

Mr Kavanagh asked the campaigners who owned the red car that blocked the front gate outside Mr O’Donnell’s property. The receiver was told sharply by one campaigner that the car belonged to the ‘car’s owners’.

The campaigner said he was not prepared to give his name or the names of his associates.

But Jerry Beades of the Land League told the Mail yesterday: ‘We are just helping the [O’Donnell] family as we do any family facing eviction.’

After several minutes, Mr Kavanagh and three other people left the front gate. The campaigners said it ‘seems likely’ they will stay for the night behind the heavy gates, however, they refused to identify themselves or how many were there when asked by the Mail.

A red car has been parked at the gates to Gorse Hill to block the property, where anti-eviction campaigners are camped outside 

As the snow began to fall and temperatures plummeted, the campaigners made their way out on to the quiet south Dublin road. 

One campaigner said they were going to get food before settling in for the night as he told others behind the wall that they would change shifts every four or five hours.

The O’Donnell couple built up a global property empire worth close to €1billion (£732million) and at the height of the boom, it seemed the world was theirs for the taking.

But when the recession hit and the flow of bank credit stopped, Mr O’Donnell and his wife Mary Pat found themselves being pursued for millions that they simply didn’t have.

Their Dublin home – referred to by some locals as ‘Dallas’ – is set on 3.5 acres with stunning views of Killiney Bay, it comes with its own tennis court and swimming pool.

The six-bedroom house also boasts a gym and sauna, snooker room and wine store.

Reportedly worth €30million (£22million) during the boom, its value has plummeted to about €7million (£5.1million).
