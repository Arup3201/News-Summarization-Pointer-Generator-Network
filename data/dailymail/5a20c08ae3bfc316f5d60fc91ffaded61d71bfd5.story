Rickie Lambert smiled when it was pointed out that his England strike rate is akin to Gary Lineker’s. ‘Say that to me again in 50 games’ time,’ he replied.

The goals keep flying in but the Scouser has a nice line in self-deprecation.

Lineker played 80 times for his country and scored 48. Only Sir Bobby Charlton has more England goals. Lambert has scored three in five.

Dream: Rickie Lambert remains grounded despite his meteoric rise from non-league to international football

Sharp shooter: Rickie Lambert took his England tally to three from five games with a strike against Ecuador

He has broken into international football relatively late, with a debut last year at 31, but the instinct for goal remains unchanged and the fairytale rise goes on — from non-league to the Barclays Premier League, a move to his beloved Liverpool and the World Cup less than a week away.

‘You’ve got to dream,’ said Lambert. ‘You’ve got to believe, that’s what I’ve done all my life. I’m rolling with it at the minute. It seems like it’s not stopping. Who knows where it will end?

‘You can get carried away with people who say it’s a completely different world. You do believe that when you’re in League Two and League One but if you believe in yourself, it’s not.

‘You have to adapt to each level and it improves you when you’re in better teams. That’s what’s happened to me over the years. Every team I’ve played in has just got better and better. It’s become a lot easier.

‘The goal doesn’t move. It’s the same shape whatever level you’re at and the ball’s the same size and shape. It’s something we’ve practised all our lives. There are still aspects I want to improve and do better.

‘It’s getting to know your players as well. This is the first time I’ve played with some of the lads but we’re doing OK.’

Lambert seems entirely at ease in this company. It is not simply the goal rate. His touch is good and he is strong in the air, giving England a different option.Most of all, he is aware of  others around him. He may not be the quickest but he reads the game and his movement is intelligent.

He looks lean and fit and, importantly for the mood and balance of Roy Hodgson’s squad, he is content to play a supporting role to the likes of Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge — although his goals may yet prove equally important in Brazil.

‘It’s not about if I start against Italy,’ said Lambert. ‘It’s about the plan that Roy’s got. We’re all behind it and whether that’s starting or coming on as sub, we’re all behind the manager.

‘I’m desperate to do well. I’m a striker and any chance I get I want to score. It’s the best feeling in the world to score for your country.’

There are no pretensions. Lambert moves in superstar circles with the world’s most famous footballers but he is grounded by a decade in the lower leagues with Blackpool, Macclesfield, Stockport, Rochdale, Bristol Rovers and Southampton.

Red alert! The 32-year-old has completed a £4m move back to his childhood club Liverpool

Just days before leaving for training camp in Miami, Lambert was finalising his £4million transfer from Saints to Liverpool, his hometown club, where he signed as a schoolboy before being released at 15.When asked to start up front against Ecuador in the Sun Life Stadium on Wednesday, he went out and smashed in England’s second goal in a 2-2 draw.

‘It’s been a life-changing couple of weeks,’ admitted Lambert, 32. ‘It’s been a life-changing couple of years. I’m trying to enjoy every second of it.

‘Walking into Melwood (Liverpool’s training ground), I couldn’t recognise it. I hadn’t been back since I trained there as a kid.

‘I hope it does give hope. It’s about working hard and believing in yourself. Anything you can do to improve your lifestyle and your own game, you must do it.’
