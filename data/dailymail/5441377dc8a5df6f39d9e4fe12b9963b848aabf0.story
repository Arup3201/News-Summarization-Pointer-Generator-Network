England Under 17s coach John Peacock has named his squad to take on Italy, Portugal and the Czech Republic in the FA International Tournament at the end of the month.

Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and the Manchester clubs are all represented in the Young Lions' selection for the annual competition, held at grounds across the Midlands.

The players that guided England to success in the European Championships back in May have now graduated to the Under 18 age group, allowing a crop of fresh faces to try and emulate them.

Among those named in the 18-man squad are Chelsea's Jay Da Silva and Charlie Wakefield, Arsenal's Kaylen Hinds and Christopher Willock, and Callum Gribbin of Manchester United.

England will play the Czech Republic at Kidderminster's Aggborough ground on August 27, Portugal at Chesterfield on August 29 and Italy at Burton Albion on August 31.

The tournament is ideal preparation for the upcoming round of European Championship qualifiers, which will take place in Cyprus in October.

Ones to match: The new crop of Under 17 players will be hoping to emulate the team that lifted the European title and they start their build-up to the next tournament with games against Italy, Portugal and the Czechs

Speaking to TheFA.com, Peacock said: 'It’s always a good opportunity to test ourselves against some of the top nations at this age group level and we’re looking forward to it as always.

'This will be the first season in a competitive UEFA tournament for the players and getting used to playing a four-group schedule like this is important in preparing us for the tests ahead.'

Goalkeepers: Aston Oxborough (Norwich City), Paul Woolston (Newcastle United)

Defenders: Jay Da Silva (Chelsea), Cameron Humphreys (Manchester City), Danny Collinge (VFB Stuttgart), Easiah Sulliman (Aston Villa), James John Yates (Everton), Hayden Coulson (Middlesbrough)

Midfielders: Adam Philips (Liverpool), Tom Davies (Everton), Jacob Maddox (Chelsea), Callum Gribbin (Manchester United), William Patching (Manchester City), Christopher Willock (Arsenal)

Forwards: Kaylen Hinds (Arsenal), Layton Ndukwu (Leicester City), Jahmal Hector-Ingram (West Ham United), Charlie Wakefield (Chelsea)
