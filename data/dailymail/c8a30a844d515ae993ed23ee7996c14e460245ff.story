A U.S. university has told its students to avoid all 'offensive' costumes during this year's Halloween celebrations.

In a letter from Dean of Students Christina Gonzales, students at the University of Colorado Boulder were told to consider the impact their costumes could have on others.

Among the themes students were asked to avoid were anything that portrays a particular culture as 'over-sexualized' including Japanese geisha costumes or dressing up as a 'squaw' (indigenous woman).

Also on the list were 'crude 
stereotypes' such as cowboys and Indians, any costume with a sombrero, 
'white trash' and 'ghetto' associated costumes.

Gonzales also asked students not to host parties that may offend others, including those with 'crime or sex work' themes.

'Making
 the choice to dress up as someone from another culture, either with the
 intention of being humorous or without the intention of being 
disrespectful, can lead to inaccurate and hurtful portrayals of other 
people's cultures,' wrote Gonzeles.

According to Fox News,
 University spokesman Bronson Hilliard said that while the school 
condemns such costumes, students would not be punished for wearing them.

'When you dress up as a cowboy, and 
you have your sheriff badge on and a big cowboy hat, that's not a 
representation of a cowboy, that's not a representation of people who 
work on a ranch that's not a representation of people who live in the 
West, that's kind of a crude stereotype,' Hilliard said.

The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports that University of Minnesota students have also been warned to carefully consider their Halloween costumes.

In a letter to students, the Office of Student Affairs asks students to 'take care' to avoid costumes that 'inappropriately perpetuate racial, cultural and gender stereotypes.'

Last year, a sorority at Penn State 
drew criticism for holding a Mexican-themed party where party-goers 
dressed up in stereotypical sombreros, mustaches and ponchos.'As
 a student, I think you’re better off erring on the side of not dressing
 like something that can be questionable,' student Mike Schmit told the 
Star Tribune.

'Cowboys, for instance - totally fine. Indians - not totally fine.'

At
 Ohio State University, a student group’s annual Halloween poster 
campaign called 'We’re a Culture, Not a Costume' to remind students of 
the real offense their costumes could cause.
