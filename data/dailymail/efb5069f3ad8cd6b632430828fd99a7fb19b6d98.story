Yvonne Davies (pictured) was found with stab wounds at her home in Stockport on Friday night

A magistrate and public relations boss was stabbed to death by her husband who later committed suicide, police believe. 

Yvonne Davies, 45, was knifed in a frenzied attack at her home on a quiet residential street. Neighbours said a man concerned for their welfare broke into the house with a hammer on Friday afternoon and discovered the bodies before police arrived. 

Mrs Davies was found stabbed to death while her husband, Andrew, also 45, was found hanged in the house after the suspected murder and suicide. 

The couple have a young daughter, but she is thought to have been at school at the time. Mrs Davies was the head of communications and public relations at Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs a number of hospitals including Manchester Royal Infirmary and Saint Mary’s Hospital. 

She was also active in the local community. She had sat as a magistrate in Manchester since 1999 and was well-respected by her fellow justices. 

As part of her role at the hospital, Mrs Davies met a host of celebrities who visited it including Manchester City midfielder David Silva and Hollywood star David Hasselhoff. 

Mr Davies was believed to have been a manager at Royal Mail in Greater Manchester, where he had worked for several years. Neighbours said the couple, who lived in a smart semi-detached house in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, appeared to be fine in the days leading up to the incident and there were no outward signs of any marital trouble. 

One neighbour said: ‘They were just perfectly normal people and there had been no rows or disturbances at their house. I don’t think they had split up or anything. 

‘They just appeared to be carrying on with their lives. They were always friendly and pleasant.’

Another said: ‘I saw them on Thursday and my son saw them on Friday morning and there certainly wasn’t any indication that anything was wrong. 

‘It’s a huge shock to everyone and very, very sad. I just feel sorry for the little one, to go to school in the morning and come back and find you’ve got no mum and dad. It’s awful.’ 

She added: ‘My husband went to walk the dog and he said, “There’s something going on over the road.” There was a commotion and people standing outside the house. 

‘Then a man, we’re not sure who he was, smashed the front door with a hammer and got in. It was him who found them.’ Sources say Mrs Davies’s colleagues are ‘absolutely devastated’ by the tragedy. 

Police forensic specialists carry out their investigation at the home. Neighbours said news of their death was a 'massive shock'

Friend Chris Lomas said: ‘Yvonne was a genuinely lovely woman who always had time for you no matter how busy she was.’ Neighbour Emma Houldsworth: ‘This is so terrible. The poor little girl left with no parents. You just wouldn’t believe anything like this could happen on your street.’ 

Police believe the deaths are a murder and suicide. Detective Superintendent Emily Higham said: ‘We are making initial inquiries and a post-mortem examination is yet to take place. 

‘However, at this stage, we do not believe there is any third party involvement and we are not currently looking for anyone in connection with their deaths. ’
