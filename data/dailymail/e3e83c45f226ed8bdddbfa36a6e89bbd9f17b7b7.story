Five geckos sent into space in an experiment to see the effects of weightlessness on sexual behaviour have all died.

The reptiles were launched into orbit by Russia's federal space agency on the Foton-M satellite to see how zero gravity would effect their reproductive habits.

But after the satellite returned to earth this week, scientists revealed the animals have not survived the journey and are suspected of having frozen to death.

The satellite was launched from Kazakhstan in July, carrying geckos, silkworm eggs, fruit flies and mushrooms for different experiments.

After Russia's space agency lost contact with the satellite later that month, a connection was re-established before the satellite landed yesterday.

A journalist from the country, Anatoly Zak, tweeted live updates from the touch-down and revealed the fate of the animals - one of which was male and other four female.

Next to a photo of the satellite, he tweeted: '#FotonM4 lands successfully'. But he later added: 'All #geckos onboard landed #Foton satellite are found dead'

A representative at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (ISTC), which was carrying out the experiment, told Russian news agency Itar-Tass: 'It's still too early to talk about the geckos' cause of death.'

But a source involved in the mission later revealed that 'preliminary information' indicated the geckos had frozen.

The Guardian reported the source as saying: 'Most likely, this happened due to a failure of the equipment meant to ensure the temperature of the box with the animals.'

It is believed the fruit flies on board survived the conditions in space.

The first animals ever sent into space were fruit flies, who were shot into the air on a U.S. V2 rocket in 1947.

Two years later, Albert II was the first monkey sent into space, but died when his parachute failed on his return. 

In 1957, the first animal into orbit, a dog named Laika, was launched aboard the Soviet Sputnik 2, the second-ever orbiting spacecraft. Laika also died during the flight.

Since then, mice, rabbits, frogs, rats, wasps and even a tortoise have all been sent into space, but rarely survive the experience.

They wanted to see effect of zero gravity on the creatures' sexual behaviour

It is thought the lizards - the latest animals to die in space - may have frozen
