Cazorla is a class act

I could watch Santi Cazorla all day. He might not get the same hype that Mesut Ozil does, but Cazorla is a maestro in midfield. He could have even more success in that No 10 role but it’s tough to displace Ozil.

The Spaniard scored twice on Saturday - one with his left foot, one with his right - and he is the best  two-footed player in the league.  He’s so good that sometimes it’s hard to know which is his stronger foot. He makes the ball talk and he’s got a football brain the size of a planet.

Strike it lucky: Santi Cazorla scored both goals as Arsenal beat Fulham

Star man: Cazorla was Arsenal's match winner on Saturday

He sees the whole picture and has a fantastic understanding of the game. What I like about him is he doesn’t look like your standard footballer.

He’s got an odd body shape and 10 or 15 years ago not many clubs would have gone near him. But he’s an artist and brings a real joy to the fans. If you like that kind of player, there’s nobody better to watch.

Aston Villa's tripple threat

Andreas Weimann, Gabriel Agbonlahor and Christian Benteke were magnificent against Liverpool. They complemented each other so well and caused problems, particularly in the first half.

Weimann gave Steven Gerrard a torrid time, working hard and pressing him into errors, Benteke led the line brilliantly and Agbonlahor was so dangerous on the break with his pace.

But over the last three seasons, Villa have finished on average just five points above the drop zone, which is not good enough.

They have the quality and Villa fans will now be asking why they can’t play this way every week.

Three wise men: Andreas Weimann, Gabriel Agbonlahor and Christian Benteke celebrate the first goal

Benteke's back

Christian Benteke scored his second goal 
in two games on Saturday, but he showed how valuable his all-round game 
is. He hit the joint most passes of any player at Anfield (57), which is
 unusual for a striker. He completed 37 passes. And as the map below shows, they came all over the pitch.

All over: Benteke made 37 passes during the game

The power of Pulis

FOUR clean sheets kept by Crystal Palace under Tony Pulis.

Tony Pulis has rejuvenated Crystal Palace and the way the Stoke fans saluted him tells you the kind of impact he can have.

Since taking over, Palace have won four matches and escaped the bottom three. They’ve still scored the fewest goals in the league (14), but only Arsenal (six) have more clean sheets since Pulis took over.

Making a difference: Tony Pulis has guided Palace out of the bottom three

Another Cabaye classic

I have talked about Yohan Cabaye many times in this column but I’m not ashamed to mention him again.

Against West Ham he produced yet another superb performance. His all-round game was just too much for them. He plays with the No 4 on his back but he’s no sitting midfielder. He roams around the pitch and gets involved everywhere, as his pitch map shows.

Running the show: The heat map shows how Cabaye got around the pitch

Alan Pardew will want the transfer window to shut because Cabaye gives Newcastle’s midfield an extra dimension and he now has to be worth at least £20million.

I don’t think Arsenal, Manchester City or Chelsea would be in the market for him, but he could be a real target for Manchester United, particularly with their problems in midfield.

United need players who  are better than what they have got and, though he’s  not world class, Cabaye would fit the bill.

Jose crowns his king David

David Luiz took the defensive midfield role to a new level. He offered a shield in front of John Terry and Gary Cahill, denying Danny Welbeck and Adnan Januzaj any room to breathe.

But at times he was so deep it was more like watching a back five than a back four. I’ve never seen a midfielder head the ball more - Terry and Cahill barely had to go up for any of David de Gea’s goal kicks.

Making it his own: David Luiz impressed in his role as a defensive midfielder

I was at the game and it was clearly something Chelsea had worked on. You could see Jose Mourinho barking orders at him to hold that line. Mourinho clearly thought: ‘Luiz is going to be my base, now it’s up to my front players to go out and win it.’

With a comfortable lead Mourinho, ever the pragmatist, ended up with seven defensive players on the pitch. Job done.

Three's company

Six points separate the top three Championship teams and it might be up to three forwards to fire their sides to promotion.

David Nugent at Leicester, QPR’s Charlie Austin and Danny Ings at Burnley could well be the difference.

Football must stick to the facts

If we needed more proof that a fifth official and video replays won’t work in football, it came this weekend. The Luis Suarez penalty debate has raged on with plenty of disagreement.

People say a fifth official would solve the problem. Good luck. How can they be expected to make the correct decision each time when people can’t even agree?

I was in the TV studio on Saturday with Stiliyan Petrov, who is Aston Villa through and through. We both thought it was a penalty. If Brad Guzan does not come rushing out, there is no penalty but a lot of people will disagree.

Going down: Luis Suarez is fouled by Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan

On his way down: Suarez falls down after a foul by Brad Guzan

If calls like this went upstairs, you would end up waiting around and any decision would still be questioned.

Goal-line technology has been fantastic. But debates are part of the reason we love football and with incidents like this, it proves they are a matter of opinion, not fact.
