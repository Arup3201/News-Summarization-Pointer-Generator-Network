Weekly bin collections have been rejected by the majority of councils, with just one council accepting a share of £250million funding to ditch fortnightly collections.

Of 216 councils who pick up rubbish and recycling on alternate weeks, just one wants to increase bin collections to weekly, but dozens have applied for support to bring in or extend separate food waste collections according to research by Materials Recycling World (MRW).

The Whitehall funding to return to weekly bin rounds was accepted by just Labour-run Stoke-on-Trent City Council, while another five councils bid for funding to return to weekly collections in challenging situations such as flats, but not for the majority of residents.

Weekly bins banished: The majority of councils have rejected £250million funding to return to weekly bin collections in favour of fortnightly pick ups

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles first announced the funding before last autumn’s Tory party conference to improve weekly rubbish collections and reverse the trend towards picking up household rubbish only once every two weeks.

The weekly bin collection funding is available to councils which return to or maintain weekly waste collections, which Mr Pickles has described as a ‘basic right’, and to cut the number of bins for householders, bring in weekly food waste rounds and boost recycling.

The research found 45 councils wanted money to bring in or extend separate food waste collections.

Local authority waste and recycling consultant Jennie Rogers told MRW: ‘It comes as no surprise to me that all bar one of those councils which already have an alternate weekly collection (AWC) have opted to keep their service.

‘Aside from the reduction in collection 
costs, league table evidence speaks for itself - recycling rates 
increase dramatically on the introduction of AWC, especially as 
alternate weekly collections often enables councils to enhance their 
recycling service.’

When the funding was announced last 
year, Paul Bettison, chief of Bracknell Forest Council in Berkshire, 
said: ‘To move from alternative weeks to weekly collections we would 
have to buy another eight collection freighters which would cost 
£1.6million and employ another 40 people.

‘We don’t know how much money we are getting. There are a lot of councils for it to be  shared between.’

Doretta Cocks, of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collections, said: ‘I do admire Eric Pickles for trying, but there was a gap between what he wanted to achieve and the reality of what the councils were actually going to do. They have just completely ignored what council tax-payers wanted.’ 

Matt Hindle, policy manager for the Anaerobic Digestion and Biogas Association, said a number of councils were looking at diverting food waste away from landfill, where rubbish incurs an increasing tax.

Segregated food waste could be used in anaerobic digestion, a process which converts organic material into gas and fertiliser, providing financial benefits or even energy supplies for councils, he said.

He said: ‘Segregated food collection is the way councils should be going on food waste, and we’d like to see that desire recognised by the Department for Communities and Local Government.’

He welcomed the move by many councils to apply for funding for separate food waste collection and urged the Government to support their schemes to help realise the full benefits of anaerobic digestion.
