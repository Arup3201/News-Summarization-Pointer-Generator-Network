Fernando Alonso's relationship with Lewis Hamilton appears to be back to full strength after behind-the-scenes footage emerged of the pair embracing following the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi.

Alonso left McLaren under a cloud at the end of the 2007 campaign after falling out with the British team and  Hamilton as they battled for the title in the Briton's debut year.

But Alonso, who will re-join McLaren next season after ending his five-year relationship with Ferrari, congratulated Hamilton, his father Anthony and girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger in the Mercedes motorhome following the Briton's world championship triumph in the desert.

Hamilton won the final race of the season to beat Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to the Formula One crown and join Alonso as a double world champion.

Alonso and Hamilton are seen entering into a conversation during the brief video before his popstar girlfriend Nicole pays tribute to Alonso's beard.

The McLaren hierarchy will meet on Thursday to discuss the identity of Alonso's team-mate next season with Danish driver Kevin Magnussen likely to be retained in favour of Jenson Button.

And Hamilton believes Alonso will be better prepared to work under McLaren boss Ron Dennis after his acrimonious exit from the team seven years ago.

'It is an interesting decision with the team, but I wish him all the best,' said Hamilton. 'Fernando has grown a huge amount over the years, both as a driver and maturity wise as well.

'And, having the experience previously with Ron, he will definitely have a much better handle on it and won't be in a tricky situation like last time.'
