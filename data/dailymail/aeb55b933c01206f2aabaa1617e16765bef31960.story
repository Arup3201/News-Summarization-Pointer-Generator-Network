Taking it easier: The Queen made 341 official engagements this year - 85 fewer than in 2012

The Queen significantly reduced the number of engagements she carried out last year, handing over more duties to younger royals.

The 87-year-old monarch conducted 341 official visits, ceremonies, audiences and investitures over the last 12 months, compared to 425 in 2012 - a drop of about 20 per cent.

Although the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 kept her busier than usual, her 2013 diary was noticeably slimmer than the 370 engagements she undertook in 2011 and the 444 in 2010. The last time she fulfilled foreign duties was in 2011.

The Queen’s workload is still prodigious, particularly for a woman two decades over the average age of retirement.

Indeed, based on these latest figures she still carries out engagements at a rate of almost one a day - in addition to the many hours she spends dealing with the red boxes full of official papers every day of the year except Christmas Day.

Buckingham Palace has always been at pains to deny any suggestion that the head of state is plans to abdicate or even semi-retire in favour of her eldest son, Prince Charles.

He turned 65 in November and is the longest-serving heir apparent in British history.

However the latest tally is a sign that the Queen is, inevitably, slowing down.

Earlier this year, palace officials were forced to announce what many royal watchers had known for some time - that the Queen had decided to completely scale back on her long-haul foreign travel.

In November Charles attended the bi-annual Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka on behalf of his mother for the first time in her six decade reign.

Indeed, the last time the Queen undertook any foreign engagement was back in 2011 - although it is very likely she will attend the 70th anniversary commemorations of the Normandy Landings in France next year.

Back at home, Prince Charles, Princess Anne and now even her grand-son, Prince William, are taking on more of her physically strenuous duties such as investitures, which require the Queen to stand on her feet, pinning on medals and wielding her father’s sword, for more than an hour at a time.

A senior royal source told the Mail: ‘The simple truth is that the Queen is simply unable to keep working at the same pace she has done for the last 60 years.

More duties: Prince Charles and Princess Anne are taking on more of the Queen's physically demanding roles

‘She isn’t retiring, she isn’t taking it easy, but she is scaling back some of her more strenuous duties.’Michael Ellis, the chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, who organised the commission of a special stained glass window in Westminster Hall to mark the event, also insisted that she was not scaling back her duties.

‘On the contrary, the fact that at age 87 she is still carrying out 341 official duties shows that Her Majesty continues to be highly devoted to her role as our Queen and I believe that she will continue in that role for many years to come,’ he said.

‘She works her way through reams of papers, she undertakes numerous audiences and she remains an example of duty and service to this country.’

The Queen’s 92-year-old husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, has also seen a reduction in his workload. In 2012 he conducted 325 official engagements, which fell to fewer than 200 this past year.

This is largely due to an extensive period of convalescence following surgery earlier this year.

Passing the baton: Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge have also taken on events, though fewer as they are not full-time royals

Charles was the busiest member of the Royal Family with more than 500 official engagements under his belt, followed by Princess Anne.

Last week the prince was named by a Danish newspaper as the hardest working member of any Royal Family in Europe.

At the bottom of the list are the youngest royals, Prince William, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge.

The brothers carried out just over 50 engagements each, but this is due to the fact that both had full-time jobs in the military and are not classed as full-time working royals.

Prince Harry also undertook a four-month posting in Afghanistan and a four-week charity trek to the South Pole.

Kate, 31, undertook just 43 engagements, but her staff have always insisted she does not want to be a full-time working royal either. She went on maternity leave in June in advance of the birth of her first baby, Prince George, the following month.
