Most of us have stayed in the kind of hotel room we'd like to run a J cloth around before we touch anything. Whether its a film of grease over everything, hairs in the bath or even cockroaches - some hotel staff really need to get their pinnies out.

And now, a new study from hotel booking website Hotel.info has dished the dirt on the world's cleanest - and more importantly its filthiest cities for an overnight stay. 

Six million customers were surveyed and the cities were scored out of ten, for their cleanliness.

How clean is your hotel room? A new study from hotel booking website Hotel.info has dished the dirt on the world's cleanest - and more importantly its filthiest - cities for an overnight stay

Guests beware: Rio de Janeiro has been voted the city with the dirtiest hotels

The hoteliers in Tokyo come out very well in comparison with other large cities in an international survey. Guests in Warsaw could also eat their food from the floor.

Brazil however scored an own goal: the World Cup was an excellent opportunity for the hotels in Brazil to improve their image. 

However the whole uproar about the World Cup seems to have left little time or energy for a 'clean-up'. In comparison with the previous football-free year the scores for cleanliness and hygiene were considerably lower in Rio (7.29) and in Sao Paulo (7.69). 

Runner up (but not one to boast about): London came in second place for dirtiest hotels

Sleep soundly: Tokyo was voted as the city with the cleanest hotel rooms worldwide

A glance at the online customer evaluations of European hotels can also help to prevent unpleasant surprises such as in Paris (7.63). 

In the UK, Sheffield came top with 8.15 points, while hoteliers in Liverpool (8.12) and Bristol (8.10) came in second and third place on the cleanliness scale. 

In Birmingham (7.42) the hotel guests were less satisfied. Even though the hotels there have somewhat improved in comparison with the previous year (7.38) the city is still at the bottom of the list. 

The capital city with only 7.52 points does not cover itself in glory: both in national and international comparisons there is room for improvement.

Don't let the bed bugs bite: If a guest finds the room to be not up to standard, Hotel.info advises complaining at once and to the relevant person

So what should you do if you find yourself in a grotty room?

According to Ralf Priemer from Hotel.info: 'Should the room occupant actually find lipstick on the pillow or dirty mirrors in the bathroom and only risk using the shower with their shoes on, then the first step is to speak with the hotel staff or the local representative of their tour operator. The traveller should remain polite but firm and request that the shortcomings be corrected immediately or that they be permitted to move to another room.

'Most importantly the complaint should be made at once and to the relevant person. If the inadequacies cannot be corrected locally and the dispute cannot be resolved the complaint should be made in writing and accompanied with photographs.'
