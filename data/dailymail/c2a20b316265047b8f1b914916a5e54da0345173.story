Manchester police have been put on high alert for the derby match on September 22 in a bid to avoid the violent scenes of last season.

Officials from United and City, together with local police and fans’ representatives, met on Monday to thrash out new security measures.

They include pre-match patrols to stop obscene graffiti being daubed round the Etihad Stadium in advance of the volatile fixture.

Sickening: Rio Ferdinand reels after being struck by a coin on derby day at the Etihad last season

On the day of the match, dogs trained
to sniff out flares will be deployed while on-duty officers will be 
given protective eyewear.

United
defender Rio Ferdinand was left bleeding with a gash above his eye 
after he was struck by a coin in the 3-2 win over the noisy neighbours 
and police are taking preventative measures to avoid flying missiles.

Ferdinand and City goalkeeper Joe Hart was approached by a fan during that match so internal stewarding will also be stepped up.

Police have stopped short of calling for a booze ban in the city centre before the game, which does not kick off until 4.00pm.

But
local hostelries have been ordered to remove all outside furniture and,
as is usual practice, only plastic glasses will be used.

Ouch: Ferdinand celebrates despite blood pouring from an open wound on his forehead

In
recent years, supporters from both sides have left tasteless graffiti 
mocking the Munich air disaster and the tragic death of Marc-Vivien Foe.

To prevent a repeat, police will patrol the area around Eastlands in the run-up to the game.

There
will be a public appeal for calm and good behaviour.  City are also 
removing triumphalist footage from the screens of away supporters and 
broadcasting the official DVD of United’s title-winning campaign 
instead.

Final say: Van Persie's deflected free-kick sealed the away win for United over their local rivals
