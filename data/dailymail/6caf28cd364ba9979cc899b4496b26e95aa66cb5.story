Reports have surfaced there is a third Australian man that has been killed in Syria in the past two weeks, among fears from leaders of the Muslims that more Australians will join the fighting.

The man from Sydney's south west is understood to be from a well-known family and married with children, Fairfax Media reports.

It follows more unconfirmed reports in recent weeks that Australia's most Islamic State militant, Mohammad Ali Baryalei was killed in the middle east.

Fairfax has also reported another IS fighter Abu Noor al-Kurdi from Sydney is believed to have been killed with Baryalei.

Mohammad Ali Baryalei has been killed in the Middle East, according to a friend

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade say they are yet to confirm the reports.

'Australian Government agencies are attempting to verify these reports however it is very difficult to do so,' said a spokesperson.

'Due to the extremely dangerous security situation consular assistance is no longer available within Syria or Iraq. The Government’s capacity to follow up reports of this kind is therefore extremely limited.'

'Australians are strongly advised not to travel to Syria and Iraq.'

Australian Federation of Islamic Councils president Hafez Kassem fears other Australians may follow in the footsteps of the Islamic extremists.

'I think they are going to defend their families there,' he told AAP.

'This is why it's very hard for communities to control something like this. We can't know where they are going or why they are going.'

'That is the message we have heard from people.' 

In light of reports about Baryalei's death, details have emerged about the former Kings Cross bouncer's past.

One source told ABC about Baryalei's love for gambling, women, drugs and painted him as someone who mixed with questionable characters. 

'He gambled a lot ... He once won $8,000 or $9,000 on the pokies, then played it back down ... and he loved cocaine.,' the source told the 7.30 program.

The friend also said they thought Baryalei, originally from Sydney, may have gotten 'in too deep' in the scene, and it seemed as though he saw more than he could handle. 

Baryalei recruited as many as half of the Australian militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in the Middle East

The wanted terrorist is also said to have battled with mental illness growing up, suffering extensive bouts of depression which saw him confined to his room for days on end.

The 33 year old from Quakers Hill, is understood to have travelled to the Middle East in April last year and has helped the movement of a number of Australians believed to fighting in Syria and Iraq.

Fairfax News reported he allegedly recruited Khaled Sharrouf, the Australian radical who posted a picture of his seven year old son with a severed head and Mohammad Elomar, wanted Australian terrorism suspect, who has also appeared in many social media images holding severed heads.

The Australian Federal Police had issued a warrant for Baryalei's arrest earlier this year. 

A neighbour of the man told The Sydney Morning Herald, he had many troubles growing up.

He apparently suffered a traumatic childhood at the hands of his abusive father, and left home at just 17.

Despite this Baryalei would still help out around the neighbourhood, doing 'odd jobs' for those who needed the help.

'He was a clean cut young man. Somebody must have gotten inside his head,' a source told the website. 

Last week Foreign minister Julie Bishop answered reports that Baryalei had been killed saying the federal government was 'currently seeking to confirm whether the 16th Australian foreign fighter had indeed been killed in this conflict'.

'It does highlight what the government has been saying that Australians who leave this country to fight in Iraq and Syria are putting themselves in mortal danger,' she said. 

The news came as Labor joined the coalition to pass foreign fighter laws.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the laws would make it easier to arrest and jail terrorists returning from overseas, monitor potential terrorists in Australia and stop 'preachers of hate'.

As news filtered through of Baryalei's apparent demise, the neighbours of his parents in Sydney's northwest spoke about his mother's pain over her son's decision to join the radical group.

The neighbour said Ms Baryalei had been devastated by her son's decision to take up arms with IS.

'She was crying. She couldn't believe it was her son,' she said.

'All she knew was he was overseas studying to be a cleric and would call her every so often.

'He was very protective of his mum.'

Despite this, authorities have told The Sydney Morning Herald Baryalei's death is unlikely to stop young Australians being recruited to fight for Islamic State. 

A senior security source told the publication that although he was a key recruiter , others were likely to step up into the position meaning Australians would continue to travel to the Middle East to fight.

'I think you'll always find there's be people who'll step into that void and they'll be people who are probably well known to us, to be honest,' he said. 

Baryalei was the ringleader of an alleged plot to behead a random member of the public in Sydney earlier this year. He was a senior recruiter for the Islamic State terror group. 

In a tribute Facebook post last night, a friend of Baryalei's, Abdul Salaam Mahmoud, said he had received news the notorious western Sydney militant had died. 

In his prior life, Baryalei (left and right) was an aspiring actor who played a bit part role in Underbelly (right)

'I've just received the news that our beloved brother Mohamed Ali who was recently strongly attacked by Australian media has been martyred,' he wrote. 

'He was a brother a friend and our leader in street dawah Sydney.' 

'Today we shall celebrate his martyrdom with tears of joy and sorrow.' 

'Oh Allah accept him as another green bird.' 

 

According to an ABC report, Baryalei it is unclear whether a Coalition air strike was responsible for Baryalei's apparent death.

Terrorism expert Professor Greg Barton, from the Global Terrorism Research Centre at Monash University, said Baryalei's killing would be a 'significant' blow to Islamic State's recruitment efforts in Australia.

Omarjan Azari, 22, was arrested and charged in the nation's largest ever terror raids last month. Prosecutors allege Baryalei conspired with him in a beheading plot

We are currently seeking to verify reports (of Mohammad Ali Baryalei's death)... I can't confirm at this stage. 

It does highlight what the government has been saying that Australians who leave this country to fight in Iraq and Syria are putting themselves in mortal danger.

They have a great risk of being killed. 

They are committing offences against Australian law. 

They are adding to the suffering of the people of Iraq and Syria. 

And they are likely to be come experienced in the ways of terrorism.

We urge young Australians in particular not to be radicalised, not to fall for these false and toxic ideologies of the terrorists, who have only been using them for their own purposes. 

'It doesn't mean a lot for Islamic State as a whole but it does mean a lot for Australia,' Prof Barton told Daily Mail Australia. 

'If it's confirmed that he is no longer, and with the Operation Appleby (terror raids)... We would have really put a dent in the recruiting network.'

Security officials believe Baryalei recruited as many of half the Australians who have joined the fighting in the Middle East - including the so-called 'Ginger Jihadist', Abdullah Elmir, 17. 

Baryalei was also accused of orchestrating an alleged plot for Omarjan Azari, a 22-year-old western Sydney man, to commit a public beheading in the streets of the nation's largest city. 

Before Baryalei fled to the Middle East in April 2013, he worked as a bit-part actor in the popular crime drama Underbelly and as a bouncer in the Kings Cross nightclub district. 

The AFP told Daily Mail Australia in early September a warrant had been issued for Baryalei's arrest over alleged terrorism-related activity. 

Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Attorney-General George Brandis were approached for comment.
