An expensive tea set that no one has ever dared to use has sold for a record price of more than £500,000.

The service’s decoration has been hailed as the 'very, very best' Meissen porcelain a collector could hope to get.

The ‘Half-Figure Service’, made in around 1723, sparked a bidding frenzy at the Bonhams sale in central London.

Delicate: An intricate Oriental-style painting of a man leading a horse on one of the service's saucers

It was eventually snapped up by an overseas buyer for a staggering £541,250, believed to be a world record for a tea service.

The set consists of a hexagonal tea canister and cover, tiny tea bowls, beakers and saucers, a milk jug and sugar bowl - but is missing its teapot.

It takes its name from the intricate Oriental-style decoration by Johann Gregorius Hvroldt - the most famous painter at the porcelain factory in Meissen near Dresden - and features half-length figures engaged in various pursuits.

His beautifully-painted scenes include a man leading a camel and another with his horse.

The tea set was the star lot in Egyptian-born seller Said Marouf’s 'incredible' Meissen collection that raised more £1 million in total at the sale.

Many of his porcelain pieces have been exhibited in museums worldwide.

Bonhams’ European porcelain specialist Nette Megens said the set is so valuable that it has probably never actually been used to take tea by its original high society owner or since.

She said: 'The rarity and quality of this tea set makes it the very, very best Meissen porcelain a collector could hope to get.

'The set is made from the most subtle porcelain possible. It is very thin and translucent.

'Johann Gregorius Hvroldt is the most famous painter from the Meissen factory and his chinoiserie scenes are imaginative and beautiful.

'Individual pieces of his work rarely come to market and never has a tea service of this calibre come to market before.

'This service was not even made to be used. It was made to be displayed on brackets on the wall to show off its quality.'

A rare Meissen chocolate cup and saucer, made in around 1739, went for £55,250 at the auction.

And a lavishly finished Meissen Hausmalar eagle teapot and cover, made in around 1715, went for £31,250.

The Meissen collection being sold by Mr Marouf and his wife Roswitha is one of the world’s biggest and most highly regarded.

Sebastian Kuhn, Bonhams’ director of European porcelain, said: 'The Said and Roswitha Marouf Collection is without doubt one of the most important collections of 18th century Meissen porcelain to come to the market.

'It is incredible to see such a selection of fine pieces, including some rare and intimate items from the royal toilette, with fascinating provenance.

'Said Marouf has been an avid collector all his life and started out collecting pocket and wrist watches.

'It is not hard to see why his eye for detail attracted him to the extremely detailed and intricate decoration of early 18th century Meissen porcelain.'

Production of porcelain at Meissen started in 1710.

It was the dominant style of European porcelain among royals and nobility until around 1756.

The techniques used in the manufacture of pieces were meant to be kept utterly secret, although there were betrayals.

According to Meissen's website, the arcanist Samuel Stöltzel attempted to use his knowledge to set up a rival to the company in Vienna in 1718.

This attempted faking exercise rendered a system of 'marking' necessary to prove the authenticity of any given piece.

Several means of identifying porcelain were devised in the next few years, although it was not until 1920 that an underglaze cobalt blue was perfected by Meissen. This ensured a forgery-proof system of marking was found.

Johann Melchior Steinbrück, first inspector at the manufactory, proposed using a motif from the Electoral Saxon coat-of-arms as the official symbol of the company, in keeping with the monogram of the then Elector Prince of Saxony and King of Poland,
Augustus the Strong.

The ensuing adoption of the 'crossed swords' gave rise to its renowned mark, which was formally adopted by Meissen in about 1731.

The 'crossed swords' are still painted on by hand today.
