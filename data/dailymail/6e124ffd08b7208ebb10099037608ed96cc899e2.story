It's one the country's most iconic vehicles and became known for its space-saving layout - but this latest feat probably isn't quite what the designers had in mind.

The record for the most people crammed in a modern Mini was broken today by a group of 28 gym girls led by Dani Maynard, who completed the feat in 18 minutes at Potters Field in central London.

The group from Eastbourne, East Sussex, had four people in the boot and broke the previous record by one person - who crammed in the Mini Hatch car for five seconds.

Faces were squashed against the 
windscreen and bodies were hanging out of the popular vehicle’s windows as the girls broke their own previous record of 27 set in Eastbourne last 
November.

‘The adrenaline is amazing, but it's 
like the worst thing ever - there's no air, you just have to zone out,’ 
said Jayne Brockwell, whose choreographed position earned her the 
nickname ‘Gearstick Girl’.

The women on the River Thames south 
bank gave morning commuters a laugh as they took part in one of many 
events happening around the globe to celebrate Guinness World Records 
day.

The eighth-annual record breaking day 
was rung in by 15-year-old Lachlan Phelps in Australia who set a new 
record for the Longest Note Held On A Didgeridoo of 65.66 seconds.

One of the day’s wackiest records was 
achieved in Japan, where Kenichi Ito broke the world record for the 
Fastest 100m Running On All Fours.

Celebration: The record for the most people crammed in a modern Mini is set at 28 by the Eastbourne team

Elsewhere: Karateka Mohammed Kahrimanovic (left) smashed 16 pairs of coconuts with both hands in one minute in Hamburg, Germany; while Kenichi Ito (right) ran 100m on all fours in 17.47 seconds in Tokyo, Japan

He completed the distance in 17.47 
seconds shaving over a second off his own time, and dreams that one day 
the Olympics will introduce an ‘all fours’ category.

Meanwhile in the US, athlete Tone 
Staubs broke the record for the Most Pogo Stick Jumps In One Minute with
 265 in Stamford, Connecticut.

And in Germany, 18-year-old Michael 
Kopp broke the record for the Longest Duration Spinning A Basketball On A
 Toothbrush, with the basketball-freestyler managing to keep a ball 
spinning for 26.078 seconds.

Guinness World Records editor-in-chief Craig Glenday 
said: ‘The Mini is a British icon, and the Mini-cram has become a symbol
 of classic world record breaking, up there with cream-cracker eating 
and leaving your fingernails untrimmed.

‘Like Guinness World Records, it’s a 
successful child of the 1950s. Guinness World Records Day is a chance to
 celebrate not just the incredible individual achievements but also 
civic and national pride.’
