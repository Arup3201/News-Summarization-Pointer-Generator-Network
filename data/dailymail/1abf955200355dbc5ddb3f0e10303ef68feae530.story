To the public, John Cole, who has 
died aged 85, was Telly’s Mr Westminster. The man with the Belfast 
accent, herringbone overcoat and upside-down spectacles, usually seen 
shivering outside 10 Downing Street.

But long before he stepped in front of the television camera, Cole was a Fleet Street old-timer.‘Hondootedly,
 Mrs Thatcher…’ was how the satirical magazine Private Eye began his 
spoof bulletins. His Spitting Image puppet had a Douglas Hurd hairdo and
 Prince Philip’s ears.

But although Cole was caricatured, he was also trusted by the public to tell things straight. On air, he kept his life-long Labour leanings in check.

'Hondootedly, Mrs Thatcher', was how Private Eye began its satirical bulletins by John Cole, who has died

Mr Cole, a household name with his 
distinctive accent and glasses, even became a 
Spitting Image puppet

As political editor of the BBC from 
1981 to 1992, he had a seat in the Westminster cockpit during one heck 
of a ride. From dawn’s radio slots to television’s late-night news 
shows, there he was, squawking down the microphone, peering into the 
camera lens like a man peeking through a keyhole.

But the unrelenting hours took their toll. He had health problems, particularly with his heart.

Yesterday,
 David Cameron led tributes, describing Cole as ‘someone who has 
contributed so much to British political life’ and a ‘titan at the BBC, 
an extraordinary broadcaster’.

Ed Miliband said: ‘My generation grew up watching John Cole. He conveyed the drama and importance of politics.’

And
 what big stories Cole covered: the Falklands War and its aftermath; the
 loopiness of Michael Foot’s Labour party; the miners’ strike – and then
 the downfall of The Lady Herself – that scintillating drama in the 
autumn of 1990 when the parliamentary Conservative party took revenge on
 its bossy Boadicea.

Described as humble, John Cole never stooped to the left-wing bias which existed in much of the BBC

As a very green sketchwriter, I got 
to know John a little at that time. He was generous with his time. He 
never let Mrs T shout at him but he never gave her cause to do so. 
Though it was open knowledge that he did not share her politics, he 
reported her views with interest and respect.

Her
 own suspicion of the ‘Bolshevik Broadcasting Corporation’ was no 
secret. But BBC bias had its roots at Broadcasting House, not in the 
reporting of political editor Cole. Once, Tory MPs practically assaulted
 Cole in the Commons lobby when BBC1’s Panorama went on its periodic 
anti-Tory sallies, but they had the wrong target.

Mrs
 Thatcher realised that Cole was a grown-up surveyor of the political 
scene. He had lived a bit and he had a newsman’s acceptance of events. 
Not for him such cheap ruses as the ‘rabbit punch’ question – when an 
interviewer tries to shock a politician with a startling question. Nor 
did Cole have much time for the political correctness which has since 
afflicted the BBC. He was an Ulster Protestant, after all.

John
 Morrison Cole, son of an electrical engineer, was born in 1927 and 
educated at Belfast’s Royal Academy. He joined the Belfast Telegraph in 
1945, covering industrial and political stories. In 1956 he joined the 
Manchester Guardian and reported trade union matters.

Cole
 hoped to become editor of The Guardian in 1975 but his flinty 
Presbyterian ways – not least his realistic view of Ulster Unionism – 
were incongenial to the London Leftists who were by then in the 
vanguard.

So he moved 
to the Observer, where he became deputy editor. He joined the BBC only 
after that paper was bought by industrialist Tiny Rowland. His BBC 
colleague John Humphrys recalled yesterday: ‘I didn’t think we should 
employ him as the on-air political editor because people would simply 
find it too difficult to understand his accent.

Today's generation of politicians and journalists grew up watching Mr Cole reporting on life in Westminster

‘Mercifully they ignored my advice 
completely. Of all the massive errors of judgment I’ve made, that was 
probably my biggest. He turned out to be a great star. People related to
 him as a warm and decent human being. They could see he was a decent 
man.’

In his newspaper 
years, Cole was a committed Labour man. He suppressed editorial 
criticism of Establishment Labour figures such as Jim Callaghan, Denis 
Healey or Merlyn Rees.

Despite
 his later image as an avuncular figure, Cole was a tough guy. At the 
BBC, in those days, there was a duty to abjure party bias. One of Cole’s
 on-air catchphrases became ‘it seems to me’ – a line he used to 
indicate to viewers his descent into (fact-based) conjecture. Like the 
best journalists, Cole was not afraid to say ‘I don’t know’. This would 
normally be preceded by an Ulster ‘ach’.

Cole
 was a natural broadcaster and it was his good luck to become BBC 
political editor just when technology permitted more ‘live’ shots, 
accentuating the drama of politics.

It
 was not just the Ulster brogue that made him memorable. He had a tone 
of urgency combined with a gnarled provincial’s perspective. Though he 
worked at Westminster he was not a metropolitan. He also disliked 
clichés.

Obstinate: Mr Cole reported on most of Margaret Thatcher's premiership and predicted her downfall, but he found her difficult to interview

He will be remembered for his image but there was much more to him than that.

He
 was a churchgoer. He felt strongly about the scourge of unemployment. 
He understood that politics mattered. What Belfast journalist of that 
era could not?

He must 
have been glad that he worked in the time before the mind-squeezing 
inanities of  Twitter and vox-pops and daytime ‘two-ways’ with Radio 
Bloke. He would have been baffled that the BBC political programmes 
noted, let alone amplified, the likes of  Russell Brand.

Cole
 is survived by his wife Madge, four sons – Donald, a Daily Mail 
sub-editor, Patrick, David and Michael – and nine grandchildren.

The
 BBC’s current political editor, Nick Robinson, is a worthy successor. 
But elsewhere, today’s Beeb could do with more John Coles. Hondootedly.

On camera: Mr Cole spent more than a decade reporting on politics for the BBC, but the punishing hours took their toll on the veteran broadcaster, particularly on his heart
