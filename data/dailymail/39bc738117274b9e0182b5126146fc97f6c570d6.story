Atlantic City's newest casino - which opened less than a year ago - is filing for bankruptcy, it was announced today.

Revel, the casino that many people had hoped 
would turn around the New Jersey city's flagging fortunes, said it
will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March.

The $2.4billion 
enterprise never caught on as much as expected, and it languished near the bottom of Atlantic City's 12 casinos in terms of revenue.

The voluntary, prepackaged bankruptcy 
envisioned for late March will wipe away about two-thirds of its $1.5billion in debt by converting more than $1billion of it into equity for
lenders.

Kevin DeSanctis, Revel's CEO, said the restructuring will give the casino resort more flexibility to operate.

'Today's
announcement is a positive step for Revel,' he said.

'The 
agreement we have reached with our lenders will ensure that the hundreds
of thousands of guests who visit Revel every year will continue to 
enjoy a signature Revel experience in our world-class facility.'

Existing
management will remain in place, no layoffs are planned, and employees 
and vendors will be paid as usual, according to the company.

The downfall of Revel is just the latest in a 
series of recent bankruptcies involving Atlantic City casinos.

Trump 
Entertainment Resorts emerged in 2010 from the third Chapter 11 
bankruptcy that it or its corporate predecessors had filed.

And the 
Tropicana Casino and Resort was sold that same year out of bankruptcy 
court to billionaire Carl Icahn.

The restructuring 
should be completed by early summer, it added.

Revel had to line up two rounds of additional financing since 
August to keep operating.

In January, it posted its second-worst 
month, winning less than $8million from gamblers.

During the second and
third quarters of last year, it reported gross operating losses of $35million and $37million.

Revel's work force is largely non-union - a
fact that earned it the undying enmity of Local 54 of the Unite-HERE 
union, representing most of the city's casino workers.

'Over three
years ago, Local 54 began expressing to every elected official in the 
city, the state and the governor's office that this project was doomed 
to failure,' said Bob McDevitt, the union's president.

'Had they 
listened to us three years ago, we would not have this catastrophe on 
our hands now.'

Michael Drewniak, Governor Chris Christie's press secretary, expressed confidence in Revel.

He said: 'We
are committed to the resurgence of Atlantic City, the tourism district,
and the many efforts currently under way to bring world-class 
attractions and entertainment to the city,' he said.

'A rejuvenated 
Revel will remain an integral part of that landscape, as it continues 
full operations as a premiere hotel, gaming and top-flight entertainment
hub for the city, in addition to employing more than 2,000 people.

'Most
importantly, none of those things that make Revel among Atlantic City's
highest-profile attractions will change, as Revel uses this new 
financial flexibility and the continued backing of its investors to grow
the business and be part of Atlantic City's expansion.'

David Rebuck, director of the state Division of Gaming Enforcement, said the Chapter 11 filing needs to happen.

'The
agreement between Revel and its lenders will allow for a necessary 
financial restructuring and improve the property's financial condition 
going forward,' he said.

'We see this as a positive step that will allow
Revel to comprehensively address its financial needs while continuing 
normal business operations.'

Revel officials have been reviewing 
their options in recent months as the Atlantic City market continued to 
decline and its own revenues remained stuck in neutral.

DeSanctis said 
the company and its lenders decided that a prepackaged Chapter 11 would 
be the best way to improve its balance sheet by eliminating substantial 
debt and increasing the changes for growth.

As part of the restructuring, 
some of Revel's lenders will provide approximately $250million in 
debtor-in-possession financing, about $45million of which constitutes 
new money commitments and approximately $205million of which is 
pre-petition debt.

No taxpayer funds will be used to finance the 
restructuring, the casino said.

The company didn't identify which lenders will be part of the filing; it said only that 'a majority' of its lenders have agreed.

Revel
opened in April as a potential game-changer - the first new casino built
in Atlantic City since the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa opened in 
2003.

Revel was designed as a destination resort, an ambitious, 
risky project in a declining market.

It saw itself not as a casino 
resort but as a resort that happened to have a casino.

But the 
distinction seemed to have been lost on many customers, who found its 
restaurants and hotel rooms pricey.

The project had to overcome 
numerous obstacles before its opening.

Three key executives working on 
the project died in a Minnesota plane crash in July 2008; a worker 
pouring concrete was struck by lightning and killed in 2011.

The 
project ran out of money during the recession and had to stop 
construction halfway through.

Morgan Stanley pulled out, taking a $1.2billion loss on the project.

It only got completed with the help of 
state tax incentives that were approved in February 2011.
