Twitter users have reacted with fury after fans of The Walking Dead objected to a kiss between two homosexual characters

The series' first gay male character Aaron (right, played by Ross Marquand) and his boyfriend Eric (left, played by Jordan Woods-Robinson shared a kiss in the most recent episode, The Distance.

Within minutes, Twitter users had hit back at the abuse - with many pointing out that it should not have come as a shock because Eric and Aaron are both gay characters in the comic that inspired the hit show.

The post-apocalyptic horror drama, which stars British actor Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes, is currently in its fifth season.

In Episode 11, Aaron, played by Ross Marquand, and his boyfriend Eric, played by Jordan Woods-Robinson fight to persuade Rick  and his comrades to join forces with their camp.

But a cynical Rick floors Aaron with a punch and tells his colleagues to tie him up and be on high alert.

Eventually Rick agrees to  travel to the new camp with the rest of the group but insists on taking a different route from the one Aaron had suggested. But they soon run into a huge group of walkers.

After fighting them off and making their way through the forest they followed a flare and were reunited with the rest of their group, who had saved Aaron's boyfriend Eric and nursed his broken ankle.

Aaron and Eric then kiss after being reunited.

The Walking Dead premiered on October 31, 2010, on the cable television channel AMC

But the scene sparked fury among some fans who took to social media to vent their anger.

Afterwards, Twitter users hit back with one, Jessica Dwyer, saying: 'Lots of homophobic #WalkingDead tweets saying "da gays" ruined the show Apparently they never read the comic Please go fall off a cliff.'

Another, Keifer Lirette, wrote: 'Things Walking Dead viewers are okay with:-Gory murder-Cannibalism-Child killingThings they aren't okay with:-Gay people.'

Talking to the Daily Beast about the intimate scene, Ross Marquand said: 'It’s been a great deal of responsibility to do it justice with respect not only to our gay fan base, but to the viewers in general.  

'When you lose someone, or you feel that you have lost someone, it doesn’t matter what the situation is, you mourn them and you miss them and you want them back and you will do anything in your power to protect the ones you love. 

'I hope that that’s the focus of our characters, that it’s not hung up so much on our sexual orientation.'
