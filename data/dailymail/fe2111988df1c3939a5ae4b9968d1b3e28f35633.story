Curtis Woodman was today accused of lying about being the victim of a brutal kidnapping

A nightclub boss lied about being kidnapped by lapdancers to escape paying them more than in £42,000 unpaid wages, a court heard.

Curtis Woodman, 34, hired lapdancers and staff to work at his pop-up nightclub during the 
Cheltenham Festival in March 2012.

But the Embassy Club in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was stormed by 50 police officers at around 9pm on the third night of opening and closed down for breaching its licence.

Bristol Crown Court was told Mr Woodman and his business partner Deano Jouni then 'vanished' and 
could not be contacted about outstanding wages - including large amounts of cash paid for lapdances.

Three of the lapdancers Mandy Cool, 29, Stephanie Pye, 31, and Rachel Goodchild, 24, and their 'manager', DJ Charlotte Devaney, managed to track down Mr Woodman to talk to him about the missing money.

But after the meeting, the court heard Mr Woodman then claimed they had kidnapped him.  He alleges he was bundled into a BMW, beaten up and forced to transfer £4,800 into a bank account during a 'terrifying' two hour ordeal, leaving him financially unable to pay the money owed.

But taking to the witness stand, Devaney, who recruited the lapdancers for the club, today denied Mr Woodman's version of events and claimed it was just a lie to get out of paying the money he owed.

Devaney
 told how she spent months chasing Mr Woodman for payment and finally 
decided to go and meet him on September 3, 2012, to demand answers.

Agent and DJ Charlotte Devaney, who is accused alongside three lapdancers of Mr Woodman's kidnap, told a court the nightclub boss is lying to get out of paying the money he owes them

'I
 am a girl,' Devaney said. 'I was sticking up for what I thought was 
right. You don’t make girls take their clothes off and then not pay them
 to work. It is not a moral thing to do.'

Devaney
 said she and the three lapdancers - dressed in miniskirts, Daisy Duke 
shorts and heels - drove to meet Mr Woodman at his work in Tewkesbury.

Cool’s boyfriend, Robert Morris, 27, and his brother Alex Morris, 23, accompanied the women for their 'protection', she said.

Robert Morris previously told the court he assaulted Mr Woodman after he disrespected the women and called them 'prostitutes'.

Mr Woodman claims he was robbed of £60 in cash, his £4,650 Breitling watch and forced to transfer £4,800 to Devaney.

Devaney said the money was transferred as part payment for that owed to the women.

'He was a free agent,' she told the jury. 'He could have walked away at any time.'

She said Mr Woodman’s claims that he had
 been surrounded and bundled into a car were 'ridiculous' and 'one 
million percent untrue'.

Martin Steen, prosecuting, accused Devaney and the group of 'playing gangster' that day.

'What, playing gangster in a miniskirt and heels? No, I don’t think so,' Devaney replied. 'He invented all of this so he didn’t have to pay us the money back.'

Alexander
 Morris, from Southampton, has admitted carrying a bladed article, 
namely a Stanley knife, on September 3, 2012, the day of the alleged 
kidnap.

He denies a charge of robbery, along with Robert Morris, also from Southampton, concerning Mr Woodman’s Breitling watch.

The
 brothers are also charged with robbery, concerning £60 Mr Woodman gave 
them from his pocket before his release. They deny the charge.

Devaney,
 from London, Pye, from Sutton Coldfield; Cool, of Southampton; and 
Goodchild, of Southampton, each deny a charge of kidnap on September 3, 
2012.

The trial, in front of judge Geoffrey Mercer, which is expected to last up to three weeks, continues.
