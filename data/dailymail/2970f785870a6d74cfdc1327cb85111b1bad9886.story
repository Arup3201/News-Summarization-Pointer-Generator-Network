Pictures of the Newmarket Bar in Thurso can be found on Facebook. By any stretch the venue is unremarkable.

Two bulky speakers mount a stage in front of the window, amplifying live music for the locals.

It’s the kind of pub found in any Scottish town. A place where, at weekends, a man can barely manage a conversation over the din.

Gary Mackay-Steven’s move to Anfield didn’t work out but he found his form at Airdrie

Working as a bar man following an ill-starred two years at Liverpool, however, Gary Mackay-Steven heard the comments. The withering asides from the other side of the bar asking what had happened to Scottish football’s next big thing.

This week the 24-year-old signed for Celtic.

Back when he was recuperating from a shattered hip, his future looked less certain.

He took a job in the Newmarket while the injury recovered. With every pint he pulled the lips of customers loosened a little more.

‘Working in the bar was funny because, as the hours tick on, people get drunker and drunker,’ recalls Mackay-Steven now. ‘They then start to say what they think.

‘There were definitely murmurs of: “What are you doing back here?”. People would say: “You could be doing this or that”. Or ask: “What are you playing at?”.’

‘But all that went in one ear and out the other. I always knew my vision and what I wanted to do. I was just waiting to feel good in myself again.

‘I enjoyed working there. It was nice and I appreciate a lot of things now.’

It was his first spell back in Thurso since leaving at the age of 15 to join Ross County.

Hugh McAuley, the head of Liverpool’s academy at the time, had spotted and nurtured Steven Gerrard, Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher. He saw something in Mackay-Steven as well. The injuries were his downfall, friends and the job in the pub his salvation.

‘I had an agent David Threlfall,’ continues Mackay-Steven, ‘and I’m still with him now. He understood my decision when I said I needed to take a step back from football.

‘He was supportive and stuck by me. I remember speaking to David after a time out of the game and telling him I felt good again. I’d been training myself down my local park, just me and a ball, and I felt ready.

‘It’s funny, I still do that to this day if I have a day off.

‘I go to the park myself with a ball and practice. I feel a bit stupid — Stuart Armstrong is doing a law degree on his time off and I’m doing keepy-uppies.

‘But I don’t think I’ll ever stop that.

‘I’ve always had that passion. Even if it was raining, my mum — probably to get me out of her hair when she was cooking the dinner — would tell me to go out with a ball. But I love it.’

When the hip recovered he took a call from the manager of Airdrie United. The Excelsior Stadium was a steep downward step from Liverpool. Well-grounded and level-headed, however, Mackay-Steven realised the comeback had to start somewhere.

‘I was never feeling hard done by or “why has this happened to me?”,’ he says.

‘It was out of my hands, it could have happened to anyone. I was fortunate enough to move to Liverpool at a young age — not many people do that at such a young age. Some people my age could have been at school.

‘It gave me an experience and a taste of something which I think helped make me hungrier to get back to where I feel I can be.

‘My family — my mum in particular — were there for me and didn’t ever let me think too much about things.

‘I had massive support from them. I’ve taken a different route to the top but I’ m here now, I’m still young, fit and healthy and feel very grateful.’

Dundee United were a key cog in his revival. On You Tube a collage of his top five moments of skill, published in honour of his 24th birthday, garnered nearly 50,000 views.

Brilliant individualism in Premiership games against St Johnstone and Kilmarnock have the viewer slowing down the images and pausing them to absorb the footwork fully.

‘It’s nice that people think of me as a skilful player,’ he shrugs, ‘but I think that just come naturally.

‘I’ll never change the way I play. Hopefully people enjoy it because football is about entertaining people, doing something different and getting bums off seats.

‘That’s all I try and do. End product is the most important thing, as managers always say, so maybe in the first few weeks here at Celtic I’ll give the tricks a miss.’

Mackay-Steven made his comeback at Airdrie after recovering from hip injury

Some players arrive at Parkhead and flounder. The scale and demands serve only to imtimidate them.

Mackay-Steven feels better prepared because of the Liverpool set-back. And the experience he has of weathering hard times.

‘I was a young boy when I went to Liverpool but I don’t regret anything, I’d do it again if I was back there. It was an amazing experience for me.

‘I feel mentally strong, having gone through what I’ve gone through.

‘I don’t think there’s ever been a time where I thought I couldn’t make it to the top, I had faith and confidence in my ability and that’s stood me in good stead from a young age.

‘I’m here now and relishing the prospect of getting started and getting involved in the games with Celtic.

‘Obviously I appreciate it more now, I’m at a club like Celtic and I’m delighted and want to make the most of it.’

He once attended a Barcelona game at Parkhead as a spectator, but now stands in line for a home debut against Inter Milan in a fortnight. It’s a game friends, family and former customers can watch on a television on the wall of the Newmarket Bar.

‘I’m still close to a lot of people in Thurso,’ says Mackay-Steven. ‘I have a lot of friends back there. My family are still there and I like to go home when I can. It doesn’t happen very often because it’s a camel trek from here.

‘But I’m definitely still close to a lot of people there.’

Even those who once asked, through the bottom of a pint glass, if Gary Mackay-Steven’s party had ended before it ever really began.
