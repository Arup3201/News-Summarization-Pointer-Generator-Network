George Osborne is planning to lift the burden of National Insurance on millions of workers in his final Budget before the General Election, senior Labour figures believe.

Shadow Cabinet ministers suspect the Chancellor will seek to make a ‘game-changing’ tax announcement later this month that could be funded by scaling back tax relief to wealthy pensioners.

Labour has been surprised by the Tories’ muted criticism of its plans, announced last week, to use tax reforms to fund a proposed cut in tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000 a year.

The party said it would cut the amount people can pay into a pension and get tax relief on over their lifetime from £1.25million to £1million, and reduce the amount that can be paid in to a pension with tax relief each year from £40,000 to £30,000.

Mr Osborne has already reduced the lifetime allowance, which used to be £1.5million, arguing that it unfairly benefited the most wealthy. 

A Labour source said a cut to £1million would fund a significant reduction in the threshold for employees’ National Insurance contributions.

Workers currently pay National Insurance on earnings above £153 a week, or £7,956 a year, at a rate of 12 per cent, but it kicks in at a far lower level than the income tax threshold, which will increase to £10,600 in April. 

Cutting National Insurance would ensure that 1.2million workers who earn too little to gain from the increase in the personal allowance – many of them women with part-time jobs – would benefit.

Tory sources insisted senior members of the Coalition had not yet met to agree measures ahead of the Budget on March 18.  

The Chancellor yesterday hailed a report from economists saying living standards in Britain will finally return to pre-recession levels.

Mr Osborne said the verdict from the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies had ‘put to bed’ several Labour myths, saying incomes had been restored to pre-crisis levels, the wealthiest have paid the most towards deficit reduction and inequality in society has been reduced.

He said the findings showed Britain had ‘reached a major milestone in the recovery, but it’s not the end of the journey’.

‘We’ve got to secure a national recovery and mustn’t abandon the progress we have made at risk by abandoning the plan that has got us this far,’ he told BBC Radio 4.

He said families had ‘paid a very heavy price for the mistakes that led to the great recession’ under Labour.

‘But the picture you hear, particularly from my political opponents, of the British economy is not one reflected in this independent report - indeed quite the opposite.

‘What they show is that Britain is growing, that incomes are rising, that the richest have made the biggest contribution, inequality has fallen ... Britain is fundamentally in a better position than it was five years ago.

‘If you look at the rate of progress in the report today, if you look at incomes, they should be higher in 2015/16 than they were in 2010/11, so on that measure as well we will have made progress.’

Cathy Jamieson, Labour’s shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘We need a recovery that reaches kitchen tables across Britain, not one which has left working people worse off.’
