Brutal scene: Zena, 10, suffered horrific injuries after being run over by the biker in front of her owner

A motorcross rider who deliberately ran down and killed an elderly dog in front of her owner is being hunted by police and the RSPCA.

The killer accelerated straight at 10-year-old Zena on a heath in Aldershot, Hants, and sent her flying 25ft, causing the German Shepherd terrible injuries.

The dog's owner said he feared for his own life as the biker roared towards him during his regular walk on Ministry of Defence-owned heathland.

He had even put Zena on a lead for safety after hearing the bike coming, but the motorcyclist mowed straight into her and her heart stopped beating minutes later.

Zena’s owner, who did not want to be identified, said: 'It was a nice day and we were in full view with lots of space around us but the man on the bike seemed to stop, look right at me and then he speeded up to around 60 miles per hour and headed flat out towards us.

'I honestly thought I was going to die but instead he hit my beautiful dog.

'As she lay on the ground dying, he carried on riding his bike around and around the area and eventually when I shouted that my dog was dead and then got my camera out to take a picture of the man, he eventually rode off.'

The man, who had owned Zena since she was 11 months old, added: 'I have gone over it in my mind.I know he could see us. He even stopped as though he was trying to intimidate me and then he rode at full speed in our direction.

'There was plenty of space for him to swerve or slow down if he wanted. It was no accident.

'I cannot even imagine what would cause anyone to behave in such a way and I am stunned, I have lost my companion and my friend. She was such a lovely dog.'

The man managed to take some pictures during the shocking incident last Thursday, which the RSPCA hope will help trap the killer.

The pair were at a site known as Caesar’s Camp, which is used for military exercises by the MoD and is also open to the public.

Over the years there has been trouble with illegal motorcyclists at the spot, which is popular with dog walkers, joggers and other nature lovers, although parts of the site have been used to host official motorcross competitions.

A spokesman for the RSPCA said: 'Although the biker appeared to stop in the distance and stare right at the dog walker, who was in plain sight, he still headed his vehicle straight towards him.'

RSPCA chief inspector Dave Fox said: 'Doing this job you get used to all manner of cruel things being done to animals but I can honestly say that this unbelievable act of cruelty is one of the worst I have seen.

'Not only did it cause no end of suffering to a much-loved pet but what the poor owner went through is horrendous.'

The biker never removed his helmet but from his frame and the way he was dressed, investigators suspect he is young.

The bike he was riding was a KTM EXC/Super Moto, which is a road legal bike, unlike a normal Moto Cross bike, as it was fitted with lights and indicators.

Under the Animal Welfare Act, anyone found guilty of causing deliberate suffering to an animal faces up to six months in prison and/or a £20,000 fine.

Anyone with information on the incident or who recognises the biker or description of the motorbike is asked to contact Ministry of Defence Police, Hampshire Police or the RSPCA.
