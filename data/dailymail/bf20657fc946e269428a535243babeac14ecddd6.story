Arsenal's young stars were handed a valuable experience last week when Arsene Wenger took six of the Under 21 squad to Istanbul for the Champions League clash with Galatasaray.

But if the 4-1 last Tuesday was Turkish delight, this Monday it was back to the bread and butter as four of those players took on Bolton at Boreham Wood.

Stefan O'Connor and Gedion Zelalem, both of whom came on at the Turk Telekom Arena were joined by Chuba Akpom and Alex Iwobi - unused substitutes last week - in a strong starting line-up for Arsenal's second string.

It was a far cry for Arsenal's young stars, who last week enjoyed a win over Galatasaray with the first team

But things could hardly have gone worse for the young Gunners, as they conceded in the first five minutes, Tom Walker finishing nicely after being set through by a chipped through ball.

Arsenal hit back through O'Connor who headed in an Akpom cross as the back post after 19 minutes.

But despite dominating the possession, and having two goals disallowed for offside, the Gunners couldn't find a winner, and were punished by two late Bolton goals.

Kaiyne Woolery took advantage of a mistake by the home goalkeeper Matt Macey with three minutes to go, and with Arsenal pushing for an equaliser, Woolery grabbed a second in stoppage time to round off the win.
