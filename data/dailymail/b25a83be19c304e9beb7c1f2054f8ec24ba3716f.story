A Labour MP who wrote an article contemplating a ban on private ownership of all cars submitted a mileage claim of £1.20 for a three-mile trip in his constituency.

Dr Alan Whitehead, who is the MP for Southampton Test outlined his anti-car vision claiming Britain would be gridlocked by 2040. 

However, Dr Whitehead has submitted mileage and parking claims for £516.60 between 2008 and 2014 which were paid for by the taxpayer.

Dr Whitehead was reimbursed sums of between £1.20 and £34 according to figures released by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. 

On February 18, 2011 Dr Whitehead traveled three miles from his home to his constituency office and submitted a mileage claim for £1.20.

Twice in January 2011 Dr Whitehead took his own private car from his Southampton home to his London residence claiming £34 for each of the 85-mile trips. 

On a journey to the Hampshire Fire Service in Eastleigh, Dr Whitehead received £4 for 'own vehicle mileage' for the ten-mile trip. 

On August 25, 2010 Dr Whitehead made a three-mile home visit where he also claimed £1.20 for 'own vehicle mileage'. 

Dr Whitehead sits on the parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee and the Energy and Clime Change Committee, and regularly blogs about 'green' issues on his website. 

In his article for The Guardian, Dr Whitehead said something urgent was required to deal with the country's ongoing traffic problems. 

He said: 'We need to consider doing something serious. What we need is a considerable expansion of public transport over the next period and a shift from car to bus, train, bike or even feet. The big problem is how to do it. 

‘What if the Government simply regulated for cars to be sold and used just as they are at present (hopefully with an increasing presence of electric and hybrid vehicles) but outlawed individual ownership?

‘People would then lease cars individually or as part of a club and the running costs would be included in the lease arrangements. No one would be prohibited from using a car, but the playing field of choice would instantly be leveled.’ 

Dr Whitehead claimed that unless something drastic is done, Britain would be gridlocked by 2040

During the 2010/2011 financial year Dr Whitehead claimed £126 in mileage for using his car. Many of the journeys around his constituency were for less than ten miles in distance. In many cases the amount submitted was for less than £2. 

In 2011/12 his mileage claims increased to £250.60 while in 2012/13 Dr Whitehead did not seek any money for driving his car although he received £126 for parking. 

During the 2013/14 tax year Dr Whitehead submitted a single parking claim for £14.

Transport Minister Robert Goodwill described Dr Whitehead's plan as 'bonkers', adding that the Labour Party had waged a '13-year war' against motorists.

Dr Whitehead was unavailable for comment at the time of publication. 

A Labour spokeswoman said: 'This is not and will not be Labour Party policy.'
