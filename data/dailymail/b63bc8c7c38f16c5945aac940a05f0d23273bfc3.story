Liverpool are wearing a special one-off kit during their game against Tottenham on Tuesday night in support of the Seeing is Believing charity.

This is the fourth consecutive year that the Merseyside club will join forces with their main sponsor Standard Chartered Bank by trading their usual logo with that of the charity in order to generate support and funds for Seeing is Believing.  

After the game on Tuesday, five of the Liverpool jerseys will be signed by players and put onto a week-long eBay auction to help raise money for the charity, with all donations being matched by Standard Chartered.
