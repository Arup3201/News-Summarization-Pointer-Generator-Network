If this video is anything to go by Wanye Rooney is more than ready for the World Cup this summer, no matter what Paul Scholes says.

The former Manchester United and England midfielder says Rooney's form hasn't been good enough in the Premier League this season.

And while captain Steven Gerrard has stuck up for the striker, he more than did his talking on the training pitch here.

Technique: Wayne Rooney shapes up to curl a ball towards goal during England's training session

No chance: And the ball flies into the back of the net at St George's Park

Rooney curls a number of efforts from the edge of the box into the top corner, past a despairing Fraser Forster at St George's Park. It wasn't all bad news for the Celtic stopper, who is shown making fine saves from Steven Gerrard and Leighton Baines.

Scholes had questioned whether Roy Hodgson had the nerve to drop Rooney, but Gerrard said: ‘Paul Scholes is wrong. He’s been Manchester United’s best player at home and in Europe. He’s been in terrific form. What I’ve seen from his performances in the United team, he’s been really positive.

‘He’s in a better frame of mind going into this tournament than he’s had going into previous tournaments when he’s had injuries.’

Keep up the top work, Wayne.
