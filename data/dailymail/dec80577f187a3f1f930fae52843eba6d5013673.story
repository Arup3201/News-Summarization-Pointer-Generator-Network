She started modeling aged 17 and had just broke into the acting industry securing a role in The Fast And The Furious when a car accident left her without the use of her legs.

But armed with a positive attitude Angela Rockwood, 37, who identifies as paraplegic, set about inspiring others in her position and years on her career is going from strength to strength.

Earlier this year she was unveiled as the star of Push Girls, a reality show which follows four wheelchair-bound women as they negotiate familiar struggles from motherhood to relationship break-ups, and now she has scored a national campaign with retail giant Nordstrom.

According to People the department store, which has 231 locations in 31 states across the US, had been scouting for models with disabilities to star in an 
upcoming campaign, and after hearing about the initiative Rockwood promptly applied and 'the rest was history'.

Despite working under different conditions to the ones she did prior to her accident in 2001, her passion for modelling and fashion remains clear.

'When I was on set for Nordstrom, I felt 
like I was at ‘home’ again. It was like throwing a 
fighter back in the ring to win their belt after a major setback from a 
recovering injury.'

As a quadriplegic Ms Rookwood, who was born in New Mexico and of German-Thai descent, requires greater assistance than her co-stars on Push Girls as she is unable to wash 
or go to the toilet without assistance.

As well as focusing on her acting and modelling career Angela is an ambassador for the Christopher 
and Dana Reeve Foundation, and worked closely on the organization’s 
minority outreach campaigns in Asian-American communities.

She is also active with a number of organisations for the disabled including Fight 2 Walk Foundation and Operation Confidence.

She added: 'The photo-shoot with Nordstrom has been so amazing it’s so important that there are companies out there that see the value in using models with disabilities. I am happy to be a part of it.'

As Nordstrom announced Rockwood as it's latest ambassador via its Facebook fan page a number of fans took time to show their approval.

Stephanie Spitz wrote: 'Thank you for your inspiration to show the modeling world that people with disabilities can look just like the "norm".

'We the "disabled person" have to go through more obstacles but nothing can hold us back from our dreams especially not societies ideals.'

Since 1991 Nordstrom has used models with disabilities in its campaigns and catalogs to reflect the diversity of its customers.

To see Rockwood’s Nordstrom campaign shoot, watch the season finale of Push Girls, airing tonight at 10 p.m. ET on the Sundance Channel.
