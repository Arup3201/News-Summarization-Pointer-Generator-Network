Critics on both sides of the Atlantic have been getting their hand-wrapping in a twist over Bernard Hopkins, at the grand old age of 49, fighting one of boxing’s hardest and most devastating punchers.

Krusher Kovalev is too much of a health risk for the most venerable gentleman of the ring, they cry.

They protested just the same only four months ago, before Hopkins defeated Beibut Shumenov to unify the IBF and WBA world light-heavyweight titles.

Champion: Hopkins' diet, work-out regime and Spartan lifestyle have helped him carry on boxing for so long

Again, Hopkins replies: ‘Age is but a number.’

So it is and that number keeps rising in all sports as medical science, high-tech training methods and social sacrifices enable more and more athletes to prolong their careers.

In the case of Hopkins, his dedication to diet, his work-out regime and a Spartan lifestyle are of a devout religious order.

Never mind the birth certificate, examine the physical specimen.

Hopkins has changed his nickname from The Executioner to The Alien and really is an out-of-this-world phenomenon.

By appearance, certainly in the physique, Hopkins looks about the same age as Floyd Mayweather, who is super-fit at 37 and as such the best pound-for-pound fighter on this planet.

Hopkins is a profoundly intelligent boxer and a highly articulate advocate for his sport.

There are no signs of wear and tear from his 65 fights spanning 28 years, the majority of them against other world-class operators in middleweight and light-heavy title fights.

Yet again, he has no hesitation in agreeing to take on the most dangerous of opponents.

Negotiations to face Sergey Kovalev began last Thursday and were finalised on Friday, 24 hours before the Russian sealed his end of the deal by defending his WBO title with a three knock-down, second round flattening of previously undefeated challenger Blake Caparello.

Hopkins and Kovalev will come to blows this November, either in Atlantic City or at the state-of-the-art Barclays Centre in New York.

And while the commentators are voicing fears for the well-being of Hopkins, many good judges in the boxing fraternity are declining to write him off.

Lou diBella, promoter of Caparello, observed after watching his man crushed: ‘Kovalev has dynamite in his fists but Hopkins is such a clever and cagey boxer that he definitely has a chance.’ 

Intimidating: Critics fear that Kovalev, left, will destroy Hopkins in a similar manner to his win over Cleverly, right

Nor has he ever been knocked out, although Kovalev’s own promoter, Kathy Duva, says: ‘We expect Sergey to be the first to do that.’

Hopkins reassures those worried for him by saying: ‘I have every intention of becoming the undisputed world light-heavyweight champion.’

In that pursuit he has turned to Kovalev after perceiving what he believes to be the reluctance of another big-hitting champion, Canada’s WBC belt-holder Adonis Stevenson, to go through with their pre-contracted clash,.

The man is fearless.

Defeated: The Russian was unstoppable during his win over Cleverly in August of last year

Specimen: Kovalev celebrates after comfortably beating Cleverly in Cardiff in August 2013

Already the oldest boxer to win and successfully defend a world title, he is determined to become the first 50-year-old ever to reign as world champion.

If he beats Kovalev he will secure that remarkable place in history, since he would not be expected to fight again before his birthday on January 15.

Krusher Kovalev, who despatched our own Nathan Cleverly into oblivion and almost into early retirement, predicts: ‘I will send The Alien to Mars.’

Hopkins, however, is one of the most difficult boxers on whom to land a concussive blow, as well as the shrewdest accumulator of points.

One is 18 years older than the other but there is no certainty as to which of them will end up seeing stars on the night of November 8 on Broadway or the Boardwallk.

 

  

The rash of dodgy decisions lately seems to be provoking more and more losers - amateur as well as professional – to cry foul by the judges.

Close though it was on the official score-cards there was no doubt in my mind that Nicola Adams rightly made another slice of history in Glasgow.

The sunny lass from Leeds, who became in London the first female boxer to win an Olympic gold medal, repeated that feat at the Commonwealth Games on Saturday.

Not happy: Michaela Walsh, left, was not happy after judges ruled Adams to be the winner on Saturday

It was well-deserved but Ireland’s young Michaela Walsh cried ‘robbery,’ apparently believing she had been the victim of Adams’ reputation and status.

How sad.

Adams is well into her 30s now and the proper time and place for the promising Walsh to make her point will be at the Rio Olympics two years from now.

Target: Walsh claimed she had been 'robbed' and that she was a victim of Adams' reputation and status

The night before in Wolverhampton, Frankie Gavin also went close but not close enough to taking the European welterweight title from Leonard Bundu.

Gavin, despite being down and almost out in mid-fight, also blamed the judges

Not only that but he claimed Bundu told him he had really won. If so, the champion was being kind to ease Gavin’s disappointment.

For the first time in nine years it was no Funtime for Franke but to his credit he apologised later for complaining.

Gavin remembered the importance of dignity in defeat. Good for him and he will come again.

For Miss Walsh, that is a lesson she has still to learn.
