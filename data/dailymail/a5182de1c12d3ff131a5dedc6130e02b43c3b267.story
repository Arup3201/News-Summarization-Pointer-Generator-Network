The Archbishop of Canterbury has swapped his mitre and cassock for a baseball hat and a high-visiblity jacket to meet late-night clubbers - and even pose for selfies.

The Most Reverend Justin Welby, 58, paid an official visit to Bristol at the weekend - but also made time to head out with the city’s street pastors as an observer to meet revellers on Saturday night.

He chatted to drinkers outside bars and spoke to police officers - before taking a service at Bristol Cathedral a few hours later, in which he spoke about his faith to a backdrop of film and live music.

Speaking of Bristol, the head of the Church of England said: ‘There seems to be a strong sense of community. There is a real sense of direction in terms of the Church.

‘I am not just trying to butter up Bishop Mike (the Bishop of Bristol, Mike Hill) - this feels like a place that knows where it’s going in church terms.’

He added: ‘When you have all that diversity going on and it’s got a real sense of direction, you can’t help but think that ideas that the Church of England are on the way out is so much claptrap.’

The married father-of-six, who took up the role as the CofE head last year after a high-flying career in the oil industry, denied his ‘real world’ experience meant he ‘got it’ more than his predecessors.

The former Bishop of Durham said: ‘My predecessors got it - you play the cards you have got in your hand. In 20 years Rowan Williams will be seen as one of the greatest Archbishops we've ever had.’

Dr Welby added: ‘I am inheriting what he built. I have had a better hand of cards given to me.’

Street Pastors is an inter-denominational organisation which aims to provide a Christian presence on the streets of local communities through volunteers who 'care, listen and help'.

It was pioneered in Brixton, south London, in January 2003 by Reverend Les Isaac, director of the Ascension Trust - and now 9,000 volunteers work in more than 225 locations around Britain.
