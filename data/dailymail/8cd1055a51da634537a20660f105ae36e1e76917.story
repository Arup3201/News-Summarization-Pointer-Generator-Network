Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping received a warm welcome when he returned to a Mississippi town 27 years after he stayed there as a young Communist party official, hoping to find out about American farming.

The likely future leader of the world's most populous country returned 
yesterday for a brief reunion to reminisce with the first Americans he 
ever met.

'My impression of the country came from you. For me, you are 
America,' Xi told a group of about 16 people he referred to as 'old 
friends.'

Warm welcome: China's vice president Xi Jinping in front of a fireplace in Roger and Sarah Lande's living room - a couple who hosted Xi for dinner when he visited Iowa in 1985

Glad to be back: As he arrived, Xi told Sarah Lande as she greeted him on her porch, 'I like your smile.' Inside, he sat on a couch with Sarah and Roger (pictured) as the Iowa residents recalled their memories of his trip

Greetings: Six-year-old Lucy Land, presented Xi Jinping with a bouquet of flowers when he arrived at her grandparents Iowa home

The relaxed gathering in front of a fireplace in Roger and Sarah 
Lande's living room in Muscatine was a stark contrast to the more 
subdued, party-line approach Xi had while meeting with U.S. leaders in 
Washington earlier this week.

During talks with President Barack Obama, members of Congress and others, Xi, 58, said little new - 
and did little to narrow the differences that exist between the U.S. and
China on issues such as human rights.

The Landes hosted Xi for dinner when he visited Iowa in 1985 as a 
31-year-old provincial Communist Party official hoping to learn about 
manufacturing, crops and livestock practices and raise his people's 
standard of living. 

As he arrived, Xi told Sarah Lande as she greeted him on her porch, 
'I like your smile.'

Xi also wooed Iowa residents during a state dinner last night at the Capitol, where officials and lawmakers praised him for his charisma and ability to connect with people

Inside, he sat on a couch in front of a fireplace 
as the Iowa residents recalled their memories of his trip.

He stood to speak - through a translator - when it was his turn and 
told Eleanor and Tom Dvorchak he remembered sleeping in their Muscatine 
bedroom in 1985, their curious daughter who asked him lots of questions 
and the popcorn they gave him as a gift.

Tom Dvorchak asked whether Xi remembered the liquor he'd given them - and he did.

He also recalled one young girl asking whether he'd seen American movies, and being shocked when he told her he'd watched 'The Godfather.' 

'It's inappropriate, but I love that man,' a beaming Eleanor Dvorchak
said after the meeting, recalling how he'd even said she hadn't aged 
since they last met and invited the Iowans to visit him in Beijing. 
'He's just such a people person. When I see him, I have so much hope for
the future. I really do.'

She said he seemed to be the same man he was in 1985: handsome, friendly and ambitious. And he had that same smile.

Twenty-seven ago Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping had travelled there to met a group of Iowa farmers and business leaders during a diplomatic exchange to this Mississippi River town in the American heartland. 

In his returning Iowa visit,  Xi had 
the opportunity to show a more personal side away from the tough 
questions on policy, trade and international relations.

A pleasure to have around: The family who looked after Xi Jinping remember a handsome and polite 31-year-old who was 'very undemanding'

Those
who attended the 45-minute reunion in the two-story Victorian home said
Xi enthusiastically introduced Chinese government leaders traveling 
with him, shook everyone's hand and even made a couple light remarks.

They
were struck by his charm, described him as genuine and hoped his 
friendly approach to Midwesterners is a positive sign for the future of 
U.S.-China relations.

'The
guy has a clairvoyant memory. It was unbelievable,' said vegetable 
farmer Tom Hoopes, who showed Xi his asparagus and sweet potatoes during
his stay in Muscatine in 1985.

'I can't imagine anyone carrying himself any better. I was absolutely overwhelmed. He carries himself like a true gentleman.'

His
return to Muscatine in the middle of his U.S. trip comes as he is 
preparing to become party leader this autumn and assume China's 
presidency in 2013.

Xi showed little spontaneity during 
the tightly scripted Washington leg of his visit, particularly when 
compared with his wisecracking host, Vice President Joe Biden. But he 
did appear confident and at ease - certainly more so than the current 
Chinese President Hu Jintao, who comes across as remote and aloof. Xi 
looked attentive, nodding and smiling when meeting Obama and other top 
officials.

Xi used his 
ties to the small, rural state of Iowa to show a personal connection 
with everyday Americans. In his main policy speech of the U.S. visit, 
delivered in Washington before he departed for Iowa on Wednesday, he 
made a strong call for more people-to-people ties between the U.S. and 
China, and referred to his 1985 trip to Muscatine.

'I'm
going to tell my old friends there that the golden keys presented to us
by Muscatine city hall symbolized the opening of local exchanges 
between our two countries,' he said.

The
local newspaper, the Muscatine Journal, reprinted a photograph of him 
accepting the key to the city Wednesday and saying then, 'Relations 
between the American people and Chinese people are deepening day by 
day.'

Xi also wooed Iowa
residents during a state dinner Wednesday night at the Capitol, where 
officials and lawmakers praised him for his charisma and ability to 
connect with people.

On 
Thursday, he will attend an agriculture conference in Des Moines and 
meet with a soybean farmer before heading to Los Angeles for the final 
stop of his tour.

While the tone of Xi's visit reflects a different style to Hu, the vice president did not break any new ground on policy, emphasizing the fact that he is not yet empowered as leader.

He has restated China's standard positions on issues such as Taiwan - the self-governing island that Beijing asserts belongs to the mainland - and Tibet, where it faces unrest by supporters of exiled Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama.

He has also reiterated a demand that the U.S. lift restrictions on high-tech exports to China.

He did concede China needed to do more to improve human rights in his country - a longstanding U.S. demand and constant thorn in relations between the two powers. But his comments mimicked those made by Hu during his state visit to Washington in January 2011.

Evans Revere, a former senior State Department official on East Asia, said through his visit to Iowa, Xi was seeking to convey a sense of his personal engagement in the U.S. relationship and that he takes it seriously.

'I think Americans appreciate that kind of gesture, as the Chinese would of an American leader telling a personal story. It pulls at the emotional heart strings a little,' he said.
