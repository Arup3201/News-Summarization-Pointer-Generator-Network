The first prosecution witness in the Joanna Yeates murder trial is due to take the stand this morning, just one day after jurors were shown her home and nearby final resting place.

The jury visited the four-room garden flat where the 25-year-old was strangled on Wednesday.

They were greeted by poignant scenes 
as, although the carpets have been stripped out by police, there are 
clear signs that home has been turned into a crime scene.

Much of it is as it would have been 
when Miss Yeates arrived back there for the last time, in the run-up to 
Christmas last year. Shortly afterwards, it is alleged, she was murdered
by her next door neighbour, Vincent Tabak.

Final resting place: The road and verge where Joanna Yeates' body was found dumped on the outskirts of Bristol on Christmas Day last year

Trial: Vincent Tabak has admitted manslaughter but denies the murder of Joanna Yeates last Christmas

The yellow-painted hallway is dotted 
with tiny red markers indicating detailed analysis by forensic 
specialists, and the white tiles of the bathroom are covered in black 
dust used to look for fingerprints.

Jurors
examining the home she shared with boyfriend Greg Reardon had been told
to pay special attention to the window above the kitchen sink, from 
where, it has been said, Miss Yeates first saw her killer on the night 
she died.

Mr Reardon has returned to the property to collect his possessions, but Miss Yeates’s clothes, belongings and furniture remain.

The
landscape architect’s body was found on Christmas Day, and preparations
for the festive season were clearly on view at the flat. The jury saw a
roll of wrapping paper under a table, an unopened box of Christmas 
crackers, and tinsel twisted around a lamp stand and hanging above the 
drawn curtains.

Normal life: The shoe rack in the hallway beside two litter trays for the pet cat Miss Yeates kept with her boyfriend Greg Reardon

Everyday items left in the flat 
include her size five running shoes, a multi-coloured cycle helmet, and 
two litter trays for the couple’s pet cat Bernard.

On
the shelves in the living room were puzzle games and memorabilia from 
the sitcom Red Dwarf, including a picture montage with cast members and 
personal messages to ‘Jo and Greg’.

Other
items seen by the jury of six men and six women were a bowl of Love 
Hearts sweets, a ring-binder full of architecture notes, a box of pain 
killers, and letters from a bank.

The couple’s double bed and duvet remain 
with two wardrobes full of clothes and a bedside table adorned with 
perfumes, make-up and cuddly toys. Miss Yeates’s hair dryer and 
straighteners lie close by.

Possessions: Beauty products toys and even a drink is left as it was found when she was murdered

A half-used pink bottle of Lacoste scent, and other toiletries – such as Imperial Source Japanese Spa shower gel and Aussie hair shampoo – have been left, next to a packet of face wipes, body lotion and four bottles of pink and red nail varnish.

As well as all the signs of Miss Yeates’s life before she was killed, the jury also saw evidence that the flat has remained unoccupied for ten months.

Plants have died in the hanging basket outside Miss Yeates’s blue front door and a dead cactus sits on the window sill.

The
jury had travelled to the flat in the affluent area of Clifton in 
Bristol as part of a ‘site-visit’ during the trial of 33 year-old Tabak.
The Dutch national did not take part in the visit, which also took 
jurors along the journey Miss Yeates made after leaving work on the 
evening of December 17.

Making a case: The bathroom in the flat is covered in police finger print dust. A loofah and bottles of shampoo have been left

Front door: The view of the entrance to the flat that she lived in, in Clifton, Bristol

Room: Miss Yeates' kitchen is covered in fingerprint dust while kitchen paper and a sponge are left out

Travelling in a bus with blacked out windows, they were briefly shown the pub she went to with colleagues, and then, accompanied by police, walked to the shops where she purchased a pizza and two bottles of cider, and then the short distance onwards to Flat 1, 44 Canynge Road.

Tabak’s QC William Clegg had asked the jury to consider the time it would take to walk the distance from the Hophouse public house – which has CCTV images which the court has been told show Miss Yeates walking home – and her £200,000 flat.

The jury was shown Tabak’s flat next door before spending more than 20 minutes inside Miss Yeates’s home.

They also visited No 53 in the same street, from where, the court has already heard, witnesses heard screams at the time Miss Yeates was attacked.

Mr Clegg had told jurors on Tuesday: ‘We would like you to go there and have in mind whether in your judgment you think it possible that the scream that was made inside the flat of No 44 could possibly be heard if you are standing outside No 53?’

Proximity: A rear view of the house shows Tabak's entrance door on the right and his bedroom window in the centre. The window on the left is that of Miss Yeates' bedroom

He added: ‘The defence are going to suggest it was by no means certain the scream that was heard was connected to this event at all because of the distance involved.’

The jury later travelled on to Longwood Lane where Miss Yeates’s body was discovered by dog walkers on Christmas Day. A yellow line showed the spot her body was found.

Miss Yeates suffered 43 injuries after being attacked by Tabak inside the flat, prosecutors claim. She was said to have suffered a slow and painful death.

The jury heard Tabak then put her body in the boot of his car and drove to Asda, where he shopped and sent text messages to his girlfriend saying he was bored.

Tabak has admitted manslaughter and denies murder. The trial continues.

Memorabilia: Mr Reardon has collected his possessions but Miss Yeates's things remain on the sitting room shelves

Items: A set of Christmas crackers to be used that year and a photo lay on a shelf

Pet lover: The feeding area of her flat where she left cat food, just as jurors saw it today

Mr Clegg also asked the jury to cross over Canynge Road to No 53 and stand by the front door.

'We
would like you to go there and have in mind, having already been to No 
44, whether in your judgment you think it possible that the scream that 
was made inside the flat of No 44 could possibly be heard if you are 
standing outside No 53?

'The
defence are going to suggest that it was by no means certain that the 
scream that was heard was connected to this event at all because of the 
distance involved.'

Finally,
Mr Clegg asked jurors to walk the short distance to Percival Court, 
which is adjacent to the rear of Miss Yeates's flat at 44 Canynge Road.

Discussion: Police guard the area around Canynge Road, Bristol, as the jury in the Joanna Yeates murder trial are shown the locations pertinent to the case

Court case: Journalists are yesterday led by police as they retrace Miss Yeates' steps on the night she died

Prosecutors claim Tabak, 33, kept his crime secret for more than six weeks before confessing to a prison chaplain.

Nigel Lickley, prosecuting, told the court yesterday that 
Tabak pinned down 5ft 4in Miss 
Yeates by her wrists as he used his height advantage to overpower his 
neighbour.

‘Her neck was held for long enough and
hard enough to kill her,’ the QC said. ‘There was a violent struggle by
Miss Yeates to survive.

‘Death
was not instantaneous. It took sufficient force to kill her. There was 
no sign of a use of a ligature. He might have let go but he did not. He 
knew that Miss Yeates was in pain and struggling to breathe. Despite 
that Vincent Tabak continued to hold and squeeze her neck to kill her.’

Crime scene: Miss Yeates was killed at her flat (left) and her body was hidden in Longwood Lane (right)

Mr
Lickley added that a fracture to her nose and bruising to her head 
‘could have been as a result of a forcible contact with the floor or 
other object’.

Home Office pathologist Dr Russell Delaney concluded Miss
Yeates died of compression of the neck, probably using two hands.

The
jury also heard that when Miss Yeates’s body was found eight days later
on Christmas Day, covered by snow beside a country lane, her T-shirt 
and bra had been pushed up to partially expose her right breast.

Tabak’s
DNA was later discovered on her chest, while police also uncovered 
clothing fibres and blood spots linking Miss Yeates to his silver 
Renault Megane car.

The 
33-year-old university graduate is said to have killed his next-door 
neighbour within minutes of her returning to the garden flat she shared 
with boyfriend Mr Reardon.
