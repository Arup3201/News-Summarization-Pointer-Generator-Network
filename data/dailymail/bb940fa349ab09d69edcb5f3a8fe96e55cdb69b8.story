Diners planning on visiting this Californian restaurant might want to take out a second mortgage.

A hotel in Los Angeles is offering diners a meat and seafood starter which costs a whopping $360 (£220).

The Avalon's Oliverio restaurant in Beverly Hills has debuted the Golden Surf & Turf, featuring succulent Kagoshima A5 Wagyu beef and half an ounce of Golden Russian Osetra caviar.

Diners willing to splash out can sink their teeth into 7oz of 'gilded' beef served on 'a bed of vibrant saffron risotto', according to the hotel. 

Executive Chef Mirko Paderno says the restaurant's menus showcase 'Italian food with a regional flair'.

'The dish is inspired by a traditional offering from Milan, which features saffron risotto and braised veal,' he added.

'We wanted to go with a twist on a classic dish that incorporates true Beverly Hills luxury and elegance.

'High-quality beef, edible gold leaves and caviar do just that.'

And it seems the price tag hasn't put off hungry diners, as the restaurant has reportedly already sold 13 of these starters.

Oliverio is known for its exquisite cuisine - and the Golden Surf & Turf is not its first VIP meal. A truffle hamburger, Hamburger al Tartufo, once featured on its menu.
