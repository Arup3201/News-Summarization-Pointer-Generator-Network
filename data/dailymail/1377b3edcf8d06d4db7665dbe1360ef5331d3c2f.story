The 'Invincible' British and Irish Lions squad of 1974 have been immortalised - by having a plane named after them.

In an unusual turn of events, Flybe unveiled the tribute in the presence of 18 squad members at George Best Belfast City Airport.

‘The Invincibles’ is now a specially named Q400 aircraft with rugby legends Roger Uttley, Willie-John McBride and Gareth Edwards in attendance.

They won three and drew one of the four Tests during the tour to South Africa 40 years ago.

Flybe UK Routes’ Director Fred Kochak said: 'In May 1974 a squad of 34 rugby players from Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales formed the British and Irish Lions Squad to travel to South Africa. They were to play against a country not beaten in 78 years. 

'When they returned in July 1974, having won 21 of their 22 matches and drawing the other, they returned as "The Invincibles" and were widely regarded as the greatest northern hemisphere side of all time. 

'Their passion, commitment and determination is legendary and we are delighted to make our own unique tribute to what they achieved and the values they continue to represent.

'Dedicating an aircraft to such sporting icons is our special way of saying congratulations and a thank you to them. As she flies across the Flybe route network, we hope that "The Invincibles" will act as an inspiration to others.'
