It's slogan may be 'Every Little Helps' but one customer got more than he bargained for when he when he found a dead lizard in a loaf of Tesco's freshly-baked bread.

Primary school pupil William Evans, 10, was slicing the multi-grain brown loaf to make toast for his breakfast when he spotted the lizard embedded in the bottom.

William, from Hawkchurch, near Axminster, Devon, said: 'I was making some toast and cut off a slice when I saw something that looked like a leaf.

Stunned: Primary school pupil William Evans, 10, found a lizard imbedded in the bottom of a Tesco loaf of bread

'So I took the wrapping off and found the lizard inside. It was about two to three inches long. It certainly put me off my toast.'

William quickly called his parents Marcus and Clare who reported the discovery to their local Tesco store in Axminster.

Mr Evans said the store customer service department said it would be impossible for a lizard to get in one of their loaves because of the company's high hygiene standards.

Mr Evans, a volunteer church worker, said: 'I am surprised they didn't tell me 'every little helps'.

'They have asked me to take it into the manager but I am thinking of contacting environmental health officers.

'We are keeping the lizard and loaf in the fridge for evidence.'

No risk: A spokesman for the Tesco store in Axminster where the bread was baked said they were confident 'robust procedures' meant there was no food safety risk to the product while in the store

He added that he was relieved William spotted the lizard before cutting into it.

Mr Evans continued: 'It was one of Axminster Tesco's baked in-store, multi-grain brown loaves.

'The lizard had not been cooked so it must have got into the packaging and died there.

'You could see the impression of its body in the bread so it must have been warm when he got in.

'The poor little lad was absolutely traumatised by it.

'He went to take a slice off for some toast, turned the loaf over and found the lizard stuck on the bottom.'

A Tesco spokesman said: 'We have conducted a thorough inspection of the bakery area as well as the rest of the store.

'We are confident that our robust procedures mean that there was no food safety risk to the product whilst it was within the store.

'If the customer would like to return the product, packaging and proof of purchase to us, we will be able to investigate further.'
