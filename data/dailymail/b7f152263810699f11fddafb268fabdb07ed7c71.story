Lee Westwood begins his 22nd year as a professional at the Dubai Desert Classic on Thursday and he's relishing the prospect more than any other season in recent times.

It's amazing what a win can do for a man, but it was also the manner of the Englishman's triumph in his last event in Thailand last month that has transformed his outlook.

'Most of my recent wins have come when I have been a few ahead in the final round, so it was nice to make up shots on the final day and do so by holing a lot of good putts,' he said.

'I can't remember when I last felt that comfortable on the greens battling down the stretch. You'd have to go back years, but that's how you've got to feel if you're going to win tournaments.

'I remember when I was young I shot a lot of 63s and 64s to win and it's like a habit – once you start doing it, it becomes easier and easier. And it's a lovely feeling. Why it starts happening I don't know. There's no panic to your game, even if you miss a couple of putts or shots early on. You just remain calm, and things start to happen in your favour.'

The belief started to return following his excellent performance at the Ryder Cup in September. 

'If you're a captain's pick you're always under a bit more pressure, so it was nice to play well for Paul (McGinley) and return his faith,' said the 41 year old Englishman. 

'So it had an influence. But, to be honest, I'd put in a lot of hard work before that, and I felt it was going to pay off.'

Westwood has put in the hours in the gym during the off-season and looks fitter than he has for some time. It certainly paid off last week while on holiday in Barbados, where he saved a man from drowning by carrying him out of the water. 

'I only did what anyone would have done under the circumstances,' said the modest Westy, who was as surprised as anyone when the man he saved decided to put the story in the public domain.

The man in question said he hoped the gods would shine on Westwood to the extent he would win three majors, but Westy himself would assuredly settle for one. 

'That's the goal this year as always but I'm not going to put pressure on myself,' he said. 'I'll be going to enjoy them, and I like the venues this year. I've always done well in recent years at the Masters, and the US Open is being staged at a new course that is supposed to have tight fairways and small greens, so that will suit me. And I've finished runner-up in an Open at St Andrews, so yes, there's plenty of reasons for me to look forward to them.'

The one change this year will come as good news to his many admirers in these isles. Although he will continue to be based in Florida, Westwood will play more in Europe. As well as the PGA at Wentworth and The Open, he will add the Irish and French Opens, plus the European Masters in Switzerland.

'For a couple of years in America it has been nice to go easy on the travelling but I've missed not playing in those events,' he said. 

'The Irish Open always has a special atmosphere and the French Open is held in a great spot in Versailles, while Crans in Switzerland is a spectacular place. So the ambition is still the same, and I want to get back in the world's top ten. I know my game is good enough and I don't see anything to scare me out there.'

Sounds like the old Westy, doesn't he? With renewed confidence, it's going to be interesting to see how he gets on.
