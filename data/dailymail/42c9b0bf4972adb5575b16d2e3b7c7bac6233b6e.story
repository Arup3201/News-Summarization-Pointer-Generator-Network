Two weeks after cascades of snow prevented vehicles from getting into the city of Valdez, at the end of the trans-Alaska pipeline, the only road into town has reopened.

Crews finished clearing away the remaining avalanche debris, and there was no damage to Richardson Highway.

A dozen or so avalanches combined to close the road on January 24, including two that completely covered the highway and about 10 that partially covered it.

Open road: It's official - The 'Damalanche' is gone. The state Department of Transportation reopened Richardson Highway near Valdez on Wednesday morning after a series of monster avalanches blocked the city's only artery to the state road system for 12 days

Unblocked: The first slides thundered down the mountain on Jan. 24 at Mile 39 near Thompson Pass and Mile 16 near Keystone Canyon, prompting transportation officials to close a 52-mile stretch of the highway

Trouble-free journey:  The avalanche dammed the Lowe River, creating a half-mile-long lake that stalled snow removal between Mile 12 and 18 for nearly a week. The blockage was dubbed the Damalanche by residents

Banks of snow about 40ft high were dumped on Richardson Highway, which runs parallel to the trans-Alaska pipeline.

The weight of snow damned the Lowe River, creating a half-mile long lake filled with 500 million gallons of icy water.

Clearing-up: Alaska highway officials say they expect to reopen an avalanche-choked highway by Wednesday afternoon, nearly two weeks after walls of snow cut off the only road into Valdez

One major avalanche was in Thompson Pass at Mile 39. That avalanche and the smaller ones were cleared last week.

Another
 big avalanche filled Keystone Canyon, which begins at Mile 12 and is 
roughly 300 feet wide. Snow piled up on the road 40 to 50 feet high from
 canyon wall to canyon wall for 1,000 to 1,500 feet.

It
 also dammed the Lowe River, creating a lake that covered 2,500 feet of 
highway. Excavation crews could not reach the upstream side of the 
avalanche until last Friday after water drained or returned to the river
 channel.

'We live in a 
really cool place where these events just make it really interesting,' 
Josh Miller, a teacher at Valdez High School, told the newspaper. He's 
been taking his classes outside to examine avalanche debris over the 
past two weeks.

Kate Dugan couldn't leave her subdivision just outside of Valdez for almost a week.

'I
 had a very understanding boss who let me work from home,' said Dugan, 
who works in communications for the Alyeska Pipeline Services Co. 'But 
life kind of continued on, maybe quieter or mellower. I was able to bake
 a little more bread.'

Valdez
 City Manager John Hozey called the blockage the price residents pay to 
live in 'one of the prettiest places in the planet.'

Located about 100 miles east of Anchorage, Valdez had remained accessible by air and water.

Heavy early winter snow was followed 
in January by unseasonably warm temperatures and then rain triggered the avalanches. One major avalanche was in Thompson 
Pass at Mile 39. That avalanche and the smaller ones were cleared last 
week.

A second major 
avalanche filled Keystone Canyon, which begins at Mile 12 and is roughly
 300 feet wide. Snow piled up on the road 40 to 50 feet high from canyon
 wall to canyon wall for 1,000 to 1,500 feet.

It
 also dammed the Lowe River, creating a lake that covered 2,500 feet of 
highway.

The lake created by the avalanche took several days to drain.

Excavation crews could not reach the upstream side of the 
avalanche until Friday after water drained or returned to the river 
channel.

The highway department also reduced the threat of additional 
avalanches by dropping explosives from a helicopter in avalanche chutes.

About
 10 workers at a time with excavators, bulldozers, loaders and a 'rock 
truck,' described as high-volume dump truck with extra-large wheels, 
have been working in 12-hours shifts around the clock since Friday to 
remove snow.

Clear the way: Road crews have started to clear parts of the highway but it is expected to reopen on Wednesday

The department completed stability tests to ensure the 
highway could support heavy loads.

Crews
 were giving the walls of snow parallel to the highway a slope to snow 
does not slough off into the roadway, Blankenship said.

Valdez remained accessible by air and water. A helicopter has been airlifting in supplies and the postal service is reportedly still working.

Despite
 the only road in being closed, a couple from Copper Center, which is 
about 100 miles away, managed to hike through the avalanches to get 
their sick cat to the town's vet.

Kristina
 Clark and Donney Carlson were able to get life-saving treatment their 
pet, Ninja, needed, but the couple were also arrested for ignoring 
police who told them not to enter the avalanche zone.
