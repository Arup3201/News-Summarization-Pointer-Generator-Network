Republican Mitt Romney listed a group of future leaders of the party, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and apologized for losing last year's presidential election during his first appearance on stage since the defeat.

While taking the responsibility for failing to unseat President Obama from the White House, Romney told the crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference of others in the party who could bring the party back to victory.

Romney mentioned Christie, who was not invited to the three-day summit for party activists for his perceived moderate actions.

Contrite: Romney apologized to the group of Republican activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference for losing last year's presidential election. He mentioned future leaders of the party, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie

'We particularly need, by the way, to hear from the governors from the blue and purple states, because those are the states we're going to have to win to be able to get back the Senate and the White House,' Romney said after mentioning Christie.

Christie, who is in his first-term as governor of the Garden State, was mentioned as a top contender as Romney's running mate last fall.

Romney told the party faithful that they must learn from the mistakes he made during the election

'Each of us in our own way will have to step up and meet our responsibility,' Romney said as he vowed to continue working with party loyalists

Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts also named South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

Romney apologized for losing the presidential election as he returned to the national stage on Friday, promising to work in a diminished role alongside conservative activists to help strengthen the GOP.

'Each of us in our own way will have to step up and meet our responsibility,' Romney told a crowded ballroom at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a three-day summit for activists in suburban Washington.

'We particularly need to hear from the governors of the blue and purple states … because their states are among those we must win to take the Senate and the White House.'

'I am sorry that I will not be your president — but I will be your coworker and I will work shoulder to shoulder alongside you. In the end, we’ll win for the same reason we’ve won before because our cause is just and it is right.'

'Of course, I left the race disappointed that we didn’t win. But I also left honored and humbled to have represented values we believe in and to speak for so many good and decent people.' 

'We’ve lost races before, and in the past, those setbacks prepared us for larger victories. It is up to us to make sure that we learn from my mistakes, and from our mistakes, so that we can win the victories those people and this nation depend upon.'

'I utterly reject pessimism. We may not have carried on Nov. 7, but we have not lost the country we love, and we have not lost our way.'

'I am sorry that I will not be your president,' Romney said.

'But I will be your co-worker, and I will work shoulder-to-shoulder alongside you.'

Romney's conservative credentials were sometimes questioned during his presidential campaign, but he was greeted with a roaring ovation and interrupted by applause several times during his brief remarks.

Advisers said his appearance was designed to thank conservatives for backing his candidacy.

Romney won the conference's straw poll one year ago, when he described himself as 'severely conservative.'

He did not repeat that phrase on Friday, but he did borrow heavily from his campaign trail speech.

Romney
referred to the same furniture upholsterer and truck driver he cited 
almost daily as he crisscrossed the country last year.

Romney is not expected to play a 
leading role in the future of the Republican Party, but he said, 'It's 
up to us to make sure that we learn from our mistakes, and my mistakes.'

He
encouraged conservatives to study the successes of the nation's 30 
Republican governors and praised the 'clear and convincing voice' of his
former running mate, Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan, who spoke in the 
same ballroom earlier in the day.

While some conservatives were always suspicious of Romney, he was given a full standing ovation during his speech at CPAC

Christie was one of Romney's earliest supporters during the 2012 election. The two are seen here campaigning together in the battleground state of New Hampshire

'Of course, I left the race 
disappointed that I didn't win,' Romney said. 'But I also left honored 
and humbled to have represented the values we believe in and to speak 
for so many good and decent people.'

He also struck the same optimistic tone of his campaign's final weeks.

'I utterly reject pessimism,' Romney 
said. 'We may not have carried on Nov. 7, but we have not lost the 
country we love, and we have not lost our way.'
