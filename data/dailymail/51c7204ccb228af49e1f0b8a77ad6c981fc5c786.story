Britain has demanded Brussels launch surprise inspections in Gibraltar of Spanish border checks in a fresh escalation of tensions between London and Madrid.

Ministers want the European Commission to make unannounced visits to assess the legality of border checks which have been blamed for long queues to enter and leave the Rock.

The row has been simmering since last summer when Spain suggested a £43.50 fee could be imposed on anyone wanting to cross the border with the British territory.

Motorists have been forced to queue at the border crossing between Spain and Gibraltar over the last year, leading ministers to ask for new inspections by European Commission officials

Visitor numbers to Gibraltar have fallen as a result of the hold-ups, which Madrid argues are needed to prevent smuggling across the border.

In November, European Commission inspectors found the checks were within the law and said Britain should work with Spain to bring down tobacco smuggling and other border crime.

However, the Foreign Office has raised doubts about the report because it was based on inspections agreed in advance with the Spanish authorities.

With the draconian checks still causing ’significant’ delays and hitting the local economy, European officials are being urged to travel to the border without giving Madrid prior warning.

‘We want them to go back and carry out more inspections but without arranging it in advance,’ said a government source.

There is also growing anger in Whitehall over Spanish ships making incursions into Gibraltan waters. The number of unlawful incidents doubled from 229 in 2012 to 496 in 2013.

Figures released in response to a parliamentary question show the number of incursions into Gibraltan waters has more than doubled in a year

Already this year from January to May there have been 185 incursions, latest figures show. As a result the Spanish Ambassador has been summoned three times to explain the aggression, most recently on April 2 this year.

Earlier this year a Spanish warship had to be escorted off British territory by Gibraltar Squadron's patrol boat, HMS Sabre, after it entered the waters near Gibraltar.

Europe minister David Lidington is expected to travel to Gibraltar within the next month to discuss the problem

The boat allegedly used a fake name and call sign, and refused to leave by its own accord at it claimed it was in Spanish waters, local media said.

The vessel approached as UK Special Forces personnel from the Royal Navy's Submarine Parachute Assistance Group were carrying out training jumps into the sea.

Government insiders suspect that the Spanish aggression towards Gibraltar is in part designed to distract attention from its domestic problems, including high unemployment and public anger at allegations of corruption. 

Europe minister David Lidington is expected to travel to Gibraltar within the next month to discuss the problems.

He has admitted that the government is ’concerned’ about the impact that border delays are having on businesses in both Spain and Gibraltar 

'The delays imposed by the Spanish authorities at the border with Gibraltar continue to have a significant impact, resulting in significant changes in behaviour at the border: visitor arrivals in Gibraltar are down and vehicle traffic has fallen,’ he said in response to a parliamentary question.

’Since the beginning of the disruption last summer, the Government has raised this issue regularly with the European Commission.’

The UK government has sent a dossier on the border delays to Spain’s Director General for Home Affairs.

It has also asked the European Commission to ’make follow-up visits to monitor the continuing delays’, Mr Lidington added.

’We continue to request that the Commission urge Spain to act on their recommendations and return border checks to reasonable and proportionate levels.’
