A walkway that was once declared the most dangerous footpath in the world has become one of the most popular tourist attractions on the planet after it was made safer by Spanish authorities.

Tourists have already snapped up the initial batch of tickets to walk along the wooden walkways and stone paths at the revamped El Caminito del Rey, which slices through the Gaitanes Gorge in southern Spain.

True thrill-seekers may be disappointed, however, as the reinforced King’s Little Pathway, as it is known in English, is now more of a beauty spot than a danger zone after a £4million (€5.5million) restoration project.

The attraction has become so popular that it does not have any openings until June. Tourists have been quick to obtain the free tickets, with up to 600 people admitted per day.

A four-mile network of paths is open six days a week, weather permitting, and it is estimated that it will take the average visitors four to five hours to walk the full route.

Before it was restored and security fences were installed, El Caminito del Rey was an extreme climbing spot, attracting daredevil holidaymakers from around the world thanks to its state of disrepair.

Situated nearly 330ft above the Gualdalhorce river, the narrow concrete path, supported by steel stanchions at around 45 degrees into the rock face, had wide gaps and rickety hand rails that posed a massive challenge for even experienced climbers.

The committee which oversees the walkway says regional and local councils spent £4million (€5.5million) on the restoration project

The attraction in the Spanish province of Malaga has become so popular that it does not have any openings until June

Tourists have been quick to snap up the free tickets, with up to 600 people admitted per day (no more than 50 visitors every 30 minutes)

As part of the years-long restoration project the walkway has been fitted with new boardwalks and security fences to keep visitors safe

Its entrances were officially closed after five people plunged to their deaths in 1999 and 2000, but that didn’t stop adrenaline junkies from continuing to risk their lives on the crumbling path.

For years locals and tourists bypassed security measures and ignored the threat of a £5,000 fine for trespassing.

That was until the Andalusian and Malagan governments launched the ambitious restoration project.

Accessible from the towns of Ardales and Alora (El Chorro), the footpath is more than 100 years old and was built for workers at two nearby hydroelectric plants. It is now overseen by a committee comprising representatives of the Malaga, Ardales and Alora councils.

It will take the average visitor four to five hours to complete the four-mile network of paths, which are open six days a week
