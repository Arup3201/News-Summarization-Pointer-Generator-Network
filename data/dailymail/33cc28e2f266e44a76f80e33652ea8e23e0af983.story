John Terry's family were left fearing for their safety after raiders lay siege to their home while the Chelsea captain was away playing in Thursday night's Barclays Premier League game against Tottenham.

The gang had broken through the perimeter gate of the property using a scaffolding pole from building work next door and were approaching the house before being chased off the premises by security guards.Â 

Terry's wife Toni and four-year-old 
children Georgie John and Summer Rose were in the mansion in Oxshott, 
Surrey, along with Terry's mother Sue and Toni's mother Sue Poole when 
the intruders struck towards the end of the game.

Terry had hired the extra security due to the intensity of the media spotlight on him following being charged by the Crown Prosecution Service with racially abusing Anton Ferdinand during Chelsea's game against QPR at Loftus Road in October.

It is unclear whether the attackers were intent on damaging the property or attempting burglary.

A friend of Terry said: 'They were all completely shocked at what happened, especially with young children in the house and two grandmothers. It was a very scary experience for all of them at a hugely difficult time for the family.'

It is understood that the attack has not been reported to the police. Terry was playing at White Hart Lane in his first match since the charges were announced. The 31-year-old was booed every time he touched the ball and was also the focus of relentless abusive chants from Spurs fans.

A hostile crowd targeted Wayne Rooney's house when he was involved in a contract dispute with Manchester United, while Peter Crouch and his model wife Abbey Clancy had their Cheshire home ransacked this week.
