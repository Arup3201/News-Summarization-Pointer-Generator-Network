Jailed: Charles Casey has been sentenced to nearly five years in a young offenders' institution for defrauding an elderly man of his life savings

A frail couple in their 90s were ‘robbed of their old age’ by a young conman who duped them out of £365,000 for bogus roof repairs.

The bill – for work that was never carried out – amounted to more than the £350,000 value of their four-bedroom detached house.

Fresh-faced Irish traveller Charles Casey, 21, was yesterday jailed for four years and eight months for swindling Ronald and Lucy Dew, 90 and 92.

Casey was among a gang of eight  sentenced for building repair and driveway resurfacing frauds that netted them almost half a million pounds from pensioners in Berkshire and Devon.

He began his fleecing of the Dews with a knock on the door, claiming they had a damp problem in their roof.

Demands for cash escalated until the couple’s savings were gone.

Retired quantity surveyor Mr Dew, married to former secretary Lucy for almost 70 years, said last night: ‘I feel very foolish to have been taken in by him. It has been two years of hell and he had robbed us of our old age.’

Mr Dew said he and his wife had hoped to spend their savings on trips to the ballet, theatre and opera – and had planned to leave a healthy inheritance for their daughter.

Reading Crown Court heard that ‘heartless’ Casey – who also admitted conning elderly Edith Dobrijevic and her son Peter, 50, out of £100,000 in  Exeter – had begun making money from the vulnerable when he was 15.

Between November 2007 and March 2008, he had been ‘the main money man’ in a £1million scam on a Bristol man with learning difficulties, for which he got away with a community service, which was later revised to a curfew.

In 2010, shortly after the Dews had paid £17,000 for roofing work on their home in Wokingham, Berkshire, he knocked on their door.

Calling himself ‘Jeffrey Andrews’, Casey told the couple the repairs had left their home suffering from damp and urgently needed dehumidifying.

He asked Mr Dew to pay a deposit for machinery at a cost of £18,000, then demanded a further £18,300 for a more powerful machine. Casey cashed the cheques almost immediately.

When Mr Dew tried to get the deposits back, he was told he could ‘jump the queue’ by paying more.

Daniel Fugallo, prosecuting, said Casey told Mr Dew that ‘if he divested himself of all he and his wife’s assets and put them over to him then all this, together with the deposits, would be returned to him. He was told to tell the banks none of this was to do with building work, but personal matters.’

Confused Mr Dew handed over more cheques. He also received calls from Casey’s partners in crime, one of whom claimed to be a ‘scambuster’, who told him not to call the police.

In January 2011, Mr Dew agreed to hand over another £13,000 in cash – but was by then suspicious of Casey.

As they discussed the situation, Casey demanded the money, which the pensioner refused to hand over, so Casey snatched the envelope from Mr Dew, which tore before Casey made off with the cash.

Police were initially unable to trace the cocaine addict and father-of-one.

Then in November 2011 Casey knocked on the door of the Dobrijevics, this time calling himself Anthony Fleet, shortly after they had paid £59,000 for paving on their driveway.

He claimed they had been scammed but he could fix it, and got them to hand over £19,000 in cash and around tens of thousands more in cheques before they called police.

Officers were at their home in April 2012 to arrest Casey when he drove round to collect a further £19,000.

His fingerprints matched those on the remains of Mr Dew’s torn envelope.

Casey admitted three money-laundering offences, two counts of conspiracy to defraud, and robbery.

Judge Nicholas Wood said of the defrauding of the Dews: ‘It was a cynical, sophisticated, selfish, heartless asset-stripping of a gullible 88-year-old man causing great shock, divesting him of his life savings of £365,000.’

Casey’s seven fellow gang members were jailed in November, receiving terms of between ten months and two years and three months for having cash from the scams paid into their accounts.
