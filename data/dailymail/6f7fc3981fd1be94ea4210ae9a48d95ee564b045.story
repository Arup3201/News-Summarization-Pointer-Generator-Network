John Terry is planning to sue the Indian government  after it used his image in  anti-smoking messages on cigarette packets.

The blurry photograph was used without the England captain’s permission and officials admitted they have no clue how he ended up on the Gold Flake packets.

In the picture, the Chelsea defender’s image has a set of blackened lungs superimposed on it with the warning  ‘Smoking Kills’.

Bizarre: A packet of cigarettes, being sold in India, appears to have a photograph of John Terry above the warning Smoking Kills

The footballer’s representative, 
Keith Cousins, said: ‘We have reviewed this matter with our client and 
have today instructed solicitors to take appropriate action.’

KS Dhatwalia, additional secretary of
the Indian directorate of visual publicity, which designed the warning,
told the Indian Express newspaper: ‘We sent the creative to the health 
ministry and they then cleared it and circulated it. But how Terry’s 
picture got to be used is  not clear.’

Terry, 31, has a tough year ahead, as his England captaincy hangs in the balance.

He faces criminal charges  over 
allegations of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton 
Ferdinand in a match last year, although he has denied the claims.

Government advertising departments have landed in trouble in the past for using 'cut-and-paste' images taken from elsewhere.

In 2010, there was embarrassment about a newspaper advertising campaign featuring India's athletes ahead of the Delhi Commonwealth Games.

Pictures of the athletes were set against planes supposedly emitting the orange, white and green national colours in vapour plumes, but the planes were in fact Italian and the smoke Italy's red, white and green.
