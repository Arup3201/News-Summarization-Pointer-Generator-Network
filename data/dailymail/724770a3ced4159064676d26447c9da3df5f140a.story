A 26-year-old college counselor has been identified as the first of ten victims who perished after a tour bus carrying high school students collided with a FedEx truck in a horrific fiery crash.

Arthur Arzola, from Rancho Cucamonga, was taken to hospital with severe burns following the crash in Northern California on Thursday but he later passed away.

Arzola, who was married, was aboard a bus carrying a group of Los Angeles-area high school students to Humboldt State University, where he was a counselor and recruiter.

The crash claimed the lives of five high school students, three chaperones and the two drivers. The teens were participating in a program that invites low-income or first-generation students to visit the school.

Krystle, was among the 10 people who were killed when a FedEx truck 
smashed into a high school tour bus in Northern California on Thursday 
afternoon

Heartbreaking: He was a recruiter for Humboldt State University, where the bus was heading

The crash happened a little after 5:30 p.m. on Interstate 5 near Orland, a small city about 100 miles north of Sacramento.

A CHP dispatcher said the bus and 
truck were on opposite sides of Interstate 5 when the FedEx truck crossed a 
grass median, hit a vehicle and then slammed into the bus, causing an explosion and fire.

'Our knowledge of it was that (the fire) was almost immediate, the flames were visible and occupants saw flames in front of bus immediately after impact,' Glenn County Sheriff Larry Jones said on Friday.

'This was a horrific collision. The impact was heard throughout the communities. People a quarter of a mile away heard this horrendous impact, and right after that impact there was a tremendous fire with very high temperatures.'

Investigators are now looking at whether the crash was caused by a mechanical failure on the FedEx truck, whether the driver fell asleep or if there could have been another cause.

Earlier, investigators had suggested that the van might have been trying to avoid a passenger car.

'There
 was a small white sedan in front of the truck,' CHP spokeswoman Lacey 
Heitman said. 'The FedEx vehicle did sideswipe the sedan before it 
crossed the median.'

On Friday, witnesses recalled seeing a man on fire desperately screaming for help after the crash.

'There was a man caught on fire,' 
Victoria Posvancz, who lives just four houses from the scene, told the Modesto Bee. 'He was pleading for help. We were helpless,we just told him to get down and roll.'

She
 said she could not reach the scene because a six-foot high fence 
separated her from the crash site, but firefighters arrived minutes 
later.

One 18-year-old student, Steven 
Clavijo, from Santa Clara, said that he and other teenagers were 
watching movies and listening to music aboard the bus just before the 
crash.

Jonathan Gutierrez, who suffered scrapes in the crash, shared these 
images to Twitter showing the bus before the deadly collision

He said he was trying to get some sleep when he felt the vehicle shake.

'I just heard this loud boom,' he said. 'We knew we were in major trouble.'

He
 said that many people escaped through a window that someone had kicked 
open before jumping down onto the road and running - seconds before the 
bus exploded.

Jonathan Gutierrez, 17, suffered cuts to his chin and right eyebrow in the crash, but escaped through the smashed window.

'When
 the impact hit, I flew from my seat to the seat in front of me and that
 caused the cut on my eyebrow,' he said. 'From there, I realized we were
 in a bad accident and the entire aisle was full of smoke, and that’s 
when students were trying to escape the tour bus.'He got through the 
window and saw fire coming from the two vehicles.

'It was a very, like, surreal moment,' he said. 'I couldn’t believe it myself but it was happening.'

A first responder who helped set up a 
triage at the scene said 36 or 37 people received injuries ranging from 
severe to minor burns, broken legs and noses and head lacerations.

'The
 victims were teenage kids. A lot of them were freaked out. They were 
shocked. They still couldn't grasp what happened,' Jason Wyman with the 
Orland Volunteer Fire Department said.

'You hear about it in the news, but you never seen anything like that,' he said.

Wyman said when he drove a water truck
 to the highway, both the bus and truck were fully engulfed in flames, 
sending thick, dark smoke into the air.

He said he was first focused on putting out the fire, and once it was under control he saw dozens of people walking wounded.

'The first victim that was taken out of the bus was severely burned,' Wyman said.

Five
 people were taken to Enloe Medical Center in Chico with minor to 
moderate injuries and four more were on the way, hospital spokeswoman 
Christina Chavira said.

Another five were taken to Mercy Medical Center in Redding in fair condition.

The
 bus was one of two that the admissions office at Humboldt had chartered to bring prospective students from Southern 
California to tour the Arcata campus, Humboldt's Vice President of 
Administrative Affairs Joyce Lopes said.

University
 police were trying to determine which school districts the students 
were from and fielding telephone calls from anxious parents, Lopes said.

Humboldt State spokesman Simon Chabel said the school was working to confirm where exactly the students were from.

'There
 is still a lot of information to be gathered, and we are working as 
hard as we can to gather that information and communicate it as best as 
we can to parents and other family members during this terrible 
tragedy,' he said.

University President Rollin Richmond said in the students had been due to visit the college campus on Friday and stay for a three-day stay on campus.

'Our
 hearts go out to those who have been affected, and we are here to 
support them, and their families, in any way possible,' he said in a 
written statement.

Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy said students on the bus were from Manual Arts Senior High School and Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools.

Sabrina Garcia, a high school senior 
from Alliance Renee & Meyer Luskin Academy High School, said she had
 been accepted to the school and was planning on joining the tour - but 
had to postpone her trip because she had a school project to finish.

'I was devastated when I heard about the crash, and relieved that I didn't attend,' Garcia said. 'I can't imagine how those kids feel. You think you're going somewhere safe with your school - and you end up in an accident.'

The bus was owned by Silverado Stages, a tour bus company based in San Luis Obisbo. The company said in a statement that it was assisting authorities in gathering information.

Bonnie
 Kourvelas, a FedEx spokeswoman, said in a statement Thursday night: 
'Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the tragic 
accident on I-5 in California. We are cooperating fully with authorities
 as they investigate.'
