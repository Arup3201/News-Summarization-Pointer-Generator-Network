Aliens: Colonial Marines is not a bad game. It's just nowhere near as good as it should have been.

Set after the events of Aliens, you play Corporal Winter, part of a U.S.S. Marine Corp battalion sent to investigate the goings-on at the USS Sulaco and LV-426.

On venturing inside the iconic ship, you’ll see the severed remains of the Bishop android on the flight deck and walk through the changing rooms used by the original marines, complete with their personal lockers. If there is something Colonial Marines excels at, it’s fan service.

Stand and deliver: There is some attempt to capture the aliens' behaviour, however, their movement is so clunky that it just doesn't look convincing

Sadly, it’s impossible to ignore just how dated the game looks. There's a blue foggy haze that swamps any larger expanses and textures range from the muddy to the non-existent.

Look past the visuals, and the gameplay holds up slightly better, albeit still flawed. The main drawback comes in the bizarre decision to include a motion-tracker prompt at the bottom of the screen. This emits the iconic ‘beep’ when an enemy is near, reminding you to check the device for its distance from you.

This cancels out any kind of tension and reduces the repetitive and linear levels into nothing more than glorified shooting galleries. The decision, too, to pit the marines against human foes (Weyland Industries' mercs), just ‘feels’ wrong and jars with the entire universe.

However, things do improve as the game goes on. There’s a genuine thrill of setting up a perimeter around the control room in Hadley's Hope and a tense (if slightly scripted) part where you have to sneak past blind aliens who are drawn to noise.

Indeed, the different species of Xeno, bravely introduced by Gearbox, are themselves very well designed and respect the source material - ranging from agile Lurkers to boil-ravaged monstrosities and smaller beasts that spit acid at you. It's a shame, then, that their movement and AI is not quite there.

Xenos will clumsily stroll past other marines and make a beeline for you, which is of particular annoyance given how unhelpful your teammates can be. They'll often unload whole clips at walls and tables, or comically run away, leaving you to fend for yourself.

Watch my back: Colonial Marines is best played with friends, with many levels requiring you to provide cover while your teammate hacks or cuts through a door

It's for this reason that Colonial Marines is best played with friends - and thankfully, multiplayer is where the game shines. Cooperative can be played via system link, locally via split screen or over the internet.

It completely changes the experience, and while you won't have any shocks or scares, shooting is done well enough to instill a real sense of comradery  - much to Gearbox's credit.

The repetitive dark surroundings and monster closets are much easier to ignore, making the whole thing feel like a sci-fi Left 4 Dead.

There are also plenty of competitive modes - which see marines take on a team of aliens. Both sides have their own strengths and weaknesses, meaning battles are often a tactical game of cat and mouse. Survivor mode, where a team of marines has to stay alive while Xenos hunt them down, is a particular highlight.

Given the six year wait, many would have expected more from Colonial Marines. But while it's not the classic it could have been, it's a respectable stop-gap until that day finally arrives.
