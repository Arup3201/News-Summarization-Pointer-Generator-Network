Reigning champion Michael van Gerwen was the main attraction at Alexandra Palace in London on Thursday night as the 2015 World Darts Championship kicked off in style in front of a capacity 2,500 crowd.

The 72 best players from 21 countries around the globe descended upon Ally Pally earlier this week to commence their battle for the Sid Waddell Trophy, the £250,000 top prize and the title of 2015 world darts champion.

And the action began on Thursday night with the first of 20 sessions over the festive period in north London along with all the usual thrills and spills, fancy dress and glamorous walk-on girls that the World Darts Championship brings.

In the showpiece match of the evening, Van Gerwen was given a huge scare by his opponent Joe Cullen but eventually came through to win 3-1 and book his place in the second round.

The Dutchman was below par in taking the opening two sets, but Cullen launched a spirited fightback to claim the third and make Van Gerwen sweat.

Van Gerwen had to dig deep in the fourth set, which he won on a deciding leg to seal a hard-fought victory against the world No 44.

After his victory, the world champion said: ‘He (Cullen) played well and put me under pressure, but a win is a win and I’m into the next round.

‘I didn’t play very well and I wasn’t consistent enough but that’s something to work around. I hit eight 180s but I made too many mistakes.

‘When he put me under pressure, my form was there straight away and that was a good sign for me.

‘The pressure wasn’t too bad, but I think I did quite well for the first game because the most important thing in the first round of the World Championship is winning.’

In the opening match of the tournament, world youth champion Keegan Brown survived a strong fightback from three-time world champion John Part.

The 22-year-old from the Isle of Wight raced into a two-set lead against his Canadian opponent, winning the first seven legs of the match.

Part finally got going in the third set, though, producing checkouts of 109 and 115 to fight his way back into the match.

The momentum was with the Canadian three-time world champion as he took the fourth set on a deciding leg, but the crucial moment came in the second leg of the fifth and final set.

Having held his throw in the opening leg, Brown earned a vital break of throw to go 2-0 ahead in the decider. And, after missing his first three throws at double top to clinch the match, Brown returned to hit double 10 and seal his place in the second round.

After his victory, Brown said: ‘I’ve got to juggle work and practicing now.

‘I will be going back to work on Monday morning as a lab assistant and be working on Christmas Day and Boxing Day as planned - then I’ll be back here a week on Sunday.

‘If someone told me that I was going to play against a former world champion in the first match on the opening night of the World Championships, I would have ripped their two arms and two legs off. This is what dreams are made of.’

‘Towards the end of the match the crowd was getting louder and louder so I’m quite glad I was playing the first match.’

Jelle Klaasen was also a winner on opening night as he saw off Dutch compatriot Christian Kist 3-1.

The No 29 seed won the opening two sets both on a deciding fifth leg before Kist came roaring back to take the third set 3-0.

But Klaasen responded by sweeping the fourth set to clinch victory and book his place in round two with an average of 96.97.

He said: ‘I started well, but the problem I’ve had in the last few months is losing focus and I lost focus in the third set. But I’m happy with the way I played in the fourth set.

‘Two years ago I changed my throw and my darts I don’t have that much action with my throw now. I made it a little simpler and the first months few months I played rubbish. But the last six months I have been playing well and I feel I can win tournaments again.’

In the final match of the evening, Spanish qualifier Cristo Reyes upset Wes Newton to win in a final-leg shootout.

Reyes won the opening two sets before Newton stormed back to level at 2-2 and force a deciding set.

The fifth set went all the way down to a final leg with the players locked together at 5-5. Referee Paul Hinks then made an error in insisting the players would not need to throw for the bull and the leg commenced, only for it to be stopped and restarted after a throw for the bull.

And it was the unfancied Spaniard who prevailed to upset the world No 13 in a controversial end to an action-packed evening at Ally Pally.
