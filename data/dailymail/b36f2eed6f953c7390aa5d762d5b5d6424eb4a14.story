The Ghana Football Association have offered their ‘unqualified apologies’ to their nation after crashing out of the World Cup at the group stage of the competition.

Ghana finished bottom of a difficult group featuring Germany, the USA and Portugal, picking up only one point in three games and the governing body’s president Kwesi Nyantakyi has now apologised for the team’s showing.

‘Admittedly, the performance of the team fell below the expectation of many Ghanaians,’ the GFA president said.

Sorry: The Ghanaian FA offered apologies to their fans following their dismal showing at the 2014 World Cup

‘Our inability to qualify to the 2nd Round broke many Ghanaian hearts. We wish to offer our unqualified apologies for the disappointment.’

The sombre tone adopted by Ghana is in stark contrast to the apathetic response of the English FA following the country’s group stage exit in Brazil.

England scored just two goals in a hugely disappointing performance at the World Cup, with England’s only point coming in a mind-numbing 0-0 draw against Costa Rica in the dead-rubber third group game.

Suspended: Kevin-Prince Boateng was dismissed from the Black Stars' squad on the same grounds as Muntari

Yet rather than apologising to the country’s supporters, FA chairman Greg Dyke came out in the immediate aftermath of England’s exit and simply declared that manager Roy Hodgson would remain in his job for at least another two years, stating that England ‘were not humiliated’.

When asked if Hodgson — whose earnings of £3.5million a year make him the second highest-paid manager at the World Cup — would remain in his job until the end of his contract in 2016, Dyke said: ‘That is the view of myself, of everybody else here in Brazil and of others in the FA.

‘We’re supportive of Roy Hodgson, we’ve asked him to stay as manager. Roy has done a good job and it was always an approach for four years and we hope to do better in the European Championship. We do not see any value in changing.’

‘Everybody thought we played really well in the first game against Italy and narrowly lost. In the second game it could have gone either way. We were not humiliated. They were narrow defeats, but it is for the football people, not for me, to identify why we did not win.’
