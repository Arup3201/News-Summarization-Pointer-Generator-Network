When 11-year-old Calvin Lock came down with a  suspected viral infection, his mother did not hesitate to give him ibuprofen.

The routine medication almost cost him his life after a violent allergic reaction left his body covered in severe blisters.

He had to be put on a life support machine and was treated in a specialist burns unit. All of his hair and fingernails fell out.

Calvin spent nearly three weeks in hospital – during which his parents were warned he could die – before being allowed home.

His mother Robyn Moult and stepfather 
Daryn Chambers are now campaigning to raise awareness of his condition, 
Stevens Johnson Syndrome, which is triggered by certain medications and 
affects three people per million each year.

Miss Moult, 38, who has three older 
children, said: 'The doctors are 100 per cent sure that the  ibuprofen 
caused Calvin's reaction.

'We would never have known that he was going to be allergic. I have given it to my other children and they have been fine.

Calvin's mother said he looked like 'someone had poured petrol all over him and then set him alight'

Doctors initially thought Calvin had chickenpox and gave him antibiotics which, the following day, had caused the swelling and rashes to spread across his body

'The severity of the allergic reaction
 was frightening. Literally every part of his body had blistered. Calvin
 looked like someone had poured petrol over him and set him alight. He 
kept asking me if he was dying.

'He said he would see us on the other 
side. We got him to record goodbye messages to his brothers and 
sisters.'

Calvin, a keen sportsman from 
Littleport, Cambridgeshire, had a sore throat on September 19 and his 
mother gave him a dose of strawberry-flavoured liquid Nurofen for 
children after his GP said he had a viral infection.

Six days later he 
returned to the GP with a rash and was diagnosed with chickenpox – for 
which SJS is often mistaken – and given antibiotics.

The next morning, swelling and rashes 
had appeared across his body and he was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital 
in Cambridge.

Doctors there also diagnosed chickenpox and it was only 24
 hours later – when he was struggling to breathe and unable to walk, 
talk or see – that he was admitted as an in-patient.

Calvin's devastated family were told he was critically ill and that his chances of survival were slim

Calvin was put on a drip as staff 
started treated more than 200 painful blisters but his condition 
deteriorated and he was put on a life-support machine.

He was 
transferred to a burns unit where surgeons removed affected skin from 65
 per cent of his body.

His mother added: 'Losing his hair has
 been tough and he hates the fact his skin looks so different. But his 
strength has been amazing.'

A spokesman for Nurofen for Children 
said warnings about the reactions suffered by Calvin are included on the
 patient information leaflet in 'consumer friendly language'.

The brave 11-year-old is now recovering well, despite his terrible ordeal
