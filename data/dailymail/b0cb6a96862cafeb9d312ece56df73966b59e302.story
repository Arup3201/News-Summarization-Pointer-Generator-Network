The driver whose car was hijacked by the Boston bombing suspects has revealed how authorities used the iPhone he left in the stolen car to track the fleeing brothers, thwarting their plans to attack New York City.

Known only as 'Danny,' the 26-year-old Chinese entrepreneur whose car was stolen, says he had pulled his car over to the side of the road to text when Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev approached his Mercedes at 11pm on April 18.

After an hour and a half in their company, Danny said this week that he managed to escape but purposely left his 
smartphone in the car and alerted police of the phone's tracking technology.

Danny previously said in interviews how the brothers shared with him their plans to go to New York.

He said he heard the brothers openly discussing driving to New York, although he couldn't make out if they were planning another attack or just looking to escape, the Telegraph reported.

On Thursday, officials in New York confirmed the brothers had decided, after 
the FBI released photos of them on April 18, to drive to Manhattan and detonate more
 explosives in Times Square.

The plan was confirmed by law enforcement officials who have been interviewing the surviving suspect, 19-year-old Dzhokhar.

New York Police Commissioner 
Ray Kelly said that plan unraveled when they realized a Mercedes sport utility vehicle they
 had hijacked did not 
have enough gasoline for the journey. 

'Questioning of Dzhokhar revealed 
that he and his brother decided spontaneously on Times Square as a 
target,' Commissioner 
Kelly told a news conference with New York Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg.

'They would drive to Times Square that same night.

'That
 plan, however, fell apart when they realized that the vehicle that they
 hijacked was low on gas and ordered the driver to stop at a nearby gas 
station,' Kelly said.

At 
the time, the men still had six explosive devices, including a 
pressure-cooker bomb of the type used at the marathon and six pipe 
bombs, he said.

Danny has described his harrowing ordeal in the company of the Tsarnaevs.

Hours 
earlier, the brothers had shot and killed a Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology campus police officer in Cambridge, authorities said.

The drive said the experience included a bizarre mix of bursts of life-threatening 
violence and everyday conversation on mundane subjects such as girls, 
how much 
payments on his Mercedes ML 350 were, the iPhone5 and whether anyone 
still 
listens to CDs, according to the Boston Globe.

To begin with Danny was driving his 
car with Tamerlan in the passenger seat beside him, while Dzhokhar 
following behind in a sedan.

Later the brother’s moved all the gear into
Danny’s car and Tamerlan drove.

The late-night drive lasted an hour and a half.

At one stage during his ordeal, Danny 
says a friend called him on his phone and he was told by Tamerlan that
he would be killed if he spoke to the person in Chinese.

Fortunately for Danny there was a problem because his car was almost out of gas and then a set of circumstances played out which afforded him an opportunity to escape his captors.

In search of petrol, the brothers stopped at a
 Shell Station but younger brother Dzhokhar was forced to go inside the
 Shell Food Mart to pay for petrol.

When
 older brother Tamerlan put his gun in the door pocket to fiddle with a 
navigation device, Danny seized his moment to escape.

Officers managed to monitor the vehicle and within hours located the brothers in the Boston suburb of Watertown, Mass.

A ferocious gunbattle ensued, killing the older brother Tamerlan, 26, but 19-year-old Dzhokhar managed to escape.

The entire city of Boston was on lockdown on April 19 while police 
frantically searched for Dzhokhar.

He was found that Friday evening, 
hiding under a tarp in a boat in the backyard of a home in Watertown.
