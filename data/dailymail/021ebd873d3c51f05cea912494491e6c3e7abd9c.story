With her bulging forehead, double chin and thin pursed lips, Jane Seymour was no oil painting…if Tudor oil paintings are to be believed.

Twenty-first century actresses, meanwhile, tend to have a natural beauty.

Which has left the makers of the BBC's big budget adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall with something of a dilemma.

Historian Lucy Worsley has reportedly said that Kate Phillips, pictured left, who plays Henry VIII's wife Jane Seymour, portrait pictured right, in BBC drama Wolf Hall is too pretty

While they have gone to great lengths to nail down historical details for the drama, they have been accused by a TV historian of casting a woman who is 'too pretty' to play Henry VIII's third wife.

The public largely gets its image of Seymour from the portrait of her by Tudor artist Hans Holbein, depicting her with a noticeably large forehead.

However, she is played in the series by Kate Phillips, 25, who cannot be faulted when it comes to her looks. According to Lucy Worsley, 41, chief curator at Historic Royal Palaces, Miss Phillips – in her first professional role – has features which are too dainty.

Miss Worsley said: 'She's too pretty. I did challenge Peter Kosminsky [the director] about that. He laughed and said, 'I picked her because of her acting, not because of her forehead'.'

Homeland star Damian Lewis plays Henry VIII in the six-part series on the rapid rise to power of Sir Thomas Cromwell in King Henry's court.

But, speaking yesterday, the historian said it was not a remark she would extend to the whole cast, which includes Homeland star Damien Lewis, 43, and Claire Foy, 30. She said: 'They are not all fantastically good looking, are they? 

'Mark Rylance [who plays Thomas Cromwell] has a wonderful craggy, creased face and, on the whole, as a cast I would say they are human rather than beautiful. It's not like it's been turned into a pageant show.'

Reverend Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at the University of Oxford, said he didn't see Miss Phillips' beauty as a problem: 'Ideas of beauty change from century to century and you might as well make them beautiful on our terms, because it's quite possible that the portraits of Jane Seymour that we've got were meant to flatter and give the impression that she was a beautiful woman.'

Historians also pointed out that Montacute House in Somerset, which was used to portray Greenwich Palace, is Elizabethan

Author Dame Hilary has  said courtiers would have had white teeth, as sugar was not yet widely available. She also said members of the court would not have been covered in filth

He continued that while the show is not an 'exact fit on the history', it is an impressive 'evocation of the period'. Wolf Hall, which starts tomorrow night on BBC Two, is a six-part adaptation of Mantel's Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies novels.

Miss Worsley questioned the authenticity of some aspects of the programme, claiming both the original books and now this adaptation have brought the characters firmly into the modern day.

She said: 'What Hilary Mantel has done is made these characters people for our times, which is interesting for a historian to watch. They are immensely modern, they won't be saying thee and thou and being all dramatic and over the top.

'I think it will make people think the Tudors were just like us in many ways. That's a massive historical question, in some ways they were and in some ways they weren't.'

The programme-makers have revealed the lengths they have gone to to ensure historical accuracy – including an unexpected insistence on straight, white teeth and pristine linen.

Mantel said a Tudor drama would be less accurate had it insisted on blackened teeth and filthy courtiers – as it was a time when sugar was yet to become widely available.
