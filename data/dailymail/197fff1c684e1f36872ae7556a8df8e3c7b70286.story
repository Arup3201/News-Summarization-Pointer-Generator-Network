A homeowner fed up with a spate of vandalism attacks on his street decided to take matters into his own to ensnare the hooligan responsible.

So Haydn Jones set up a £300 CCTV system in the hope of catching the yob in the act.

But the mystery attacker keying cars and ripping off wing mirrors outside his home in Islington, north London was not some feral youth.

The perpetrator caught on camera was a well-dressed man in suit trousers, an overcoat and carryning a rucksack.

Caught in the act: The mystery attacker boots the wing mirror of Mr Jones's Porsche Cayenne in January

Mr Jones spent £300 on the CCTV system which caught the vandal, and has since handed the footage to the Met Police

The CCTV captured the smartly-dressed
man ripping off the wing mirror of Mr Jones' blue 4x4 Porsche Cayenne 
and kicking it across the street on January 14.

Mr Jones handed the footage to police as they hunt the thug.

The businessman said: 'There were 30 
cars keyed last summer and the average cost to sort that out for each 
resident was between £500 and £1,000.

'We involved the police but it didn't look particularly promising. So I bought a CCTV system to keep a track on any damage.'

Mr Jones added: 'Then on January 14, my wing mirror had been smashed and I had all the footage that captured the guy doing it.

'He looks like a man in his 30s who was smartly dressed, as though he had been out for dinner or drinks.

'He just walks along Gibson Square 
and tries to yank off a few wing mirrors but then gets hold of my wing 
mirror and pulls it off before kicking it across the bonnet.

'He then used one of the cut-throughs behind the square, so he clearly knew where he was going.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said they had yet to identify the attacker and are still investigating.

Police have urged anyone with information to call police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
