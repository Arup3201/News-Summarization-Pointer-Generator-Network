Nick Clegg has been challenged by his own party to ‘shame’ Tories and Labour into ending grubby party funding deals with big donors.

The Lib Dem leader is warned not to ‘bottle’ the chance to reform rules on how political parties raise millions from wealthy businessmen and union barons.

But Mr Clegg is expected to repeat his call to Ed Miliband and David Cameron to return to the negotiating table to return public trust the party politics.

Pressure: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was up to the Conservatives and Lib Dems to return to the negotiating table to overhaul party funding

Talks on overhauling donations have 
repeatedly collapsed, but the latest round of donors given seats in the 
House of Lords has reignited calls for an end to the perception that 
honours are traded in exchange for cash.

Mr Clegg, along with David Clegg and Ed Miliband, was accused of 'polluting Parliament' by giving party donors seats in the House of Lords as a slate of 30 new peers was unveiled.

The list of 14 new Tory peers included big money donor and JCB boss Sir Anthony Bamford, whose family has given some £2.5million to the Tories, and Conservative treasurer Howard Leigh who has given £37,682 since 2011.

Mr Clegg appointed 10 new Lib Dem peers, including major donor James Palumbo, founder of the Ministry of Sound nightclub, who has boosted party coffers by almost £700,000 including £80,000 since the start of this year.

Another Lib Dem donor becoming a peer, Rumi Verjee, has given the party £770,000 since May 2010. He becomes Lord Verjee.

Today Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott called on Mr Clegg to stop the next election being bought with ‘dirty money’.

He said the Deputy PM should not give 
the Tories a veto on the issue, claiming there is a House of Commons 
majority in favour of reforming party funding.

Lord Oakeshott told BBC Radio 4's 
Today programme that he wanted to see a £5,000 cap on political 
donations and tougher rules around election campaign spending.

In a direct challenged to his party leader, Lord Oakeshott said: 'I am now saying: Nick - you are in charge, show some leadership, don't bottle out. You, Nick, are in charge of party funding and frankly we do not need agreement from all three parties to do it.

‘There's a long history of this, we've been quite close to agreement, and the Conservatives have vetoed it.

‘The reason is the Conservatives have the big money. Labour at last are facing up to it, Ed MIliband is actually being brave taking on the unions.

‘There is a majority in this House of Commons, I'm sure, for party funding reform but we cannot afford to give the Conservatives a veto on it, as indeed with the House of Lords reforms.

‘Nick Clegg has been very firm in the past and the recent past on it so now, Nick, this is your chance. Liberal Democrats who are appalled, all of us, by this behaviour, we're now saying to you, Nick, please take a lead, call in the other two parties, talk to them about it and shame people into doing it.

‘We still have 18 months to go, we can stop the next election being bought with dirty money as previous elections have been.’

Last month Mr Clegg revealed that the latest attempt to reform party funding had stalled without agreement. Tories refuse to back curbs on big money donations while individual.

But in recent weeks Labour leader Mr Miliband has moved to suggest he will water down his party’s links with the unions, risking up to 90 per cent of the levies paid by millions of members.

A source close to Nick Clegg said: 'Lord Oakeshott is quite right to say that the whole way political parties are funded needs top-to-bottom reform.

'Nobody has tried harder than Liberal Democrats in Government to make this happen but, as so often before, the vested interests in both the Labour and Conservative parties have scuppered reform.

'A cross-party deal has always improved impossible because Labour would not give up their union funding; and the Tories would not give up big donations.

'If Labour and the Conservatives are serious about reform, we would be the first round the table because we remain convinced that all parties, including our own, need to change the way that they are paid for in order to restore public faith in politics.'

Yesterday Mr Clegg blamed Labour and the Conservatives for blocking attempts to reform the House of Lords.

Speaking on his radio phone-in, he said: ‘I would be delighted to not be sitting here not talking about appointments at all, if only the Labour and Conservatives had let you and everybody else listening to this show have a say on who goes into the House of Lords.

‘I think the whole thing should be scrapped and we should have an elected House of Lords.

‘But given we don’t I am appointing  people who I think will be good Liberal Democrat peers, sharing the values of my party in the House of Lords,’ he told LBC 97.3.
