Nottingham Forest striker Darius Henderson intervened in a row between his girlfriend and alleged lover and broke a New Year’s Eve reveller’s cheekbone, a court heard.

The 31-year-old was seeing in New Year 2011 with girlfriend Lucy Caplan when Hazel Kent allegedly confronted him at Darcy’s restaurant in St Albans, Hertfordshire.

Miss Kent, 48, claimed she and Henderson, who now plays for the Championship team, had recently met for sex - even describing the brand of boxer shorts he wore and the inside of his home.

John Bell, 42, who had been dining with his partner John Lavelle and some friends at a nearby table, tried to calm down Henderson but the footballer lashed out, St Albans Crown Court was told.

He allegedly punched Mr Bell so hard it fractured his cheekbone and damaged his eye socket. Mr Bell’s injuries were so serious he had to have surgery and now has titanium plates in his face.

Henderson - who played for Millwall at the time and has also been at Sheffield United, Watford, Reading and Swindon Town - is on trial charged with grievous bodily harm.

Opening the case, prosecutor Alan Richards said: ‘This case concerns an unfortunate incident at the end of a long and generally pleasant night in St Albans.

‘Mr Henderson, who is a professional footballer, was out with his girlfriend Lucy Caplan. They ate together at Darcy’s restaurant, then went through to the bar to see the New Year in.

‘Mr Bell was out with his partner John Lavelle and two female friends. The two groups had little contact with each other... everything was perfectly convivial between them.

‘In fact none of the parties were responsible for sowing the seeds of tension that night. Another person, Hazel Kent, was in the restaurant.

‘For reasons best known to herself, she behaved somewhat unpleasantly to Mr Henderson and Miss Caplan, asserting on more than one occasion, that she had recently had sex with Mr Henderson.

‘She asserted that she could describe Mr Henderson’s home to establish the truth of her assertions - it seems she may have correctly identified that brand of boxer shorts.

‘Understandably this upset Miss Caplan and caused some tension between her and Mr Henderson. Equally understandably Mr Henderson was keen that Miss Kent should leave him and Miss Caplan alone.

‘There is no reason to believe that this was anything other than pure fiction, but Miss Kent persisted.’

Jurors heard Mr Bell tried to step in to calm things down. But then Henderson, of Markyate, Hertforshire, allegedly punched him twice in the head.

Mr Richards said: ‘It is possible that his intervention caused Mr Henderson, who was already upset and angered by Miss Kent’s behaviour, to perceive Mr Bell as somehow associated with her.

‘What is absolutely clear, say the 
prosecution, is that Mr Bell posed no threat to Mr Henderson whatsoever.
Even if his intervention was unwelcome it could not even begin to 
justify what he did.

'(Darius) Henderson punched Mr (John) Bell in the head twice. It may be the first blow did not connect but the second certainly did and Mr Bell was knocked to the floor'

Alan Richards, prosecuting

‘He punched Mr Bell in the head twice. It may be the first blow did not connect but the second certainly did and Mr Bell was knocked to the floor.’

The attack was captured on the restaurant’s CCTV and 6ft 4in Henderson was arrested at the scene. In the footage Mr Bell was seen chatting to Henderson at the bar after Miss Caplan walked off.

Some jurors gasped as they watched the video of Henderson punching Mr Bell twice after appearing to stumble off his seat. In an interview Henderson told police he thought Mr Bell was going to hit him.

Mr Richards told a jury of eight men and four women: ‘Mr Henderson’s case was, as it remains, that he perceived Mr Bell to pose a threat to him so he hit first in self-defence.

‘The law does allow for pre-emptive strikes to be launched in self-defence but the prosecution say that is simply not the truth of what happened here.

‘If there can be an explanation of Mr Henderson’s behaviour, the Crown submits it lies in his anger and frustration at what happened earlier in the evening, which was not of Mr Bell’s making.

‘Even if that goes someway to explaining why Mr Henderson acted as he did, it cannot and does not excuse it.’

Giving evidence, Mr Bell said he could not remember anything after 11pm. He told jurors: ‘The next thing I remember is being in Watford A&E having a brain scan.’

Prior to that, he said: ‘I remember talking to Lucy outside at about 9pm. I asked her for a cigarette.

‘She said she had hair extensions and 
asked if they looked alright. She said she was with her partner, who she
said was an athlete, and showed me a nice bracelet she was given for 
Christmas.’

'Do you recollect a conversation with Mr Henderson in which you suggested Millwall Football Club were s***?'

Henderson’s lawyer Sean Minihan accused Mr Bell of antagonising his client prior to the alleged assault at around 1.30am.

He asked: ‘Do you recollect a conversation with Mr Henderson in which you suggested Millwall Football Club were s***?’ ‘No, I don’t follow football,’ Mr Bell answered.

He continued: ‘Any recollection of asking Mr Henderson to apologise to a woman and threatening him?’ ‘No,’ Mr Bell said.

Mr Minihan asked: ‘Do you know what bottling means? Any recollection of making that threat?’ ‘No,’ Mr Bell replied.

Restaurant manager Anna Iwanicka said Miss Kent, 48, was being very loud in the bar area before tearing into Henderson.

She said: ‘The way she was speaking I think she wanted to be heard. I don't know what she was saying exactly.

‘At some point I saw her approach Mr Darius Henderson and Lucy. She was very possessive and dominating. From what I could see she was going towards him and saying something and then going back.

‘She was drunk and being very unpleasant. I decided to keep an eye on her as she seemed to want to be the centre of attention and cause problems for people.’

Anna Iwanicka, restaurant manager

Miss Iwanicka said the couple began to look irritated and kept asking Miss Kent to leave them alone. When she wouldn't Miss Caplan burst into tears and stormed out, the court heard.

It was when Henderson was sitting alone that Mr Bell came over and there was a brief conversation between them.

The restaurant manager said both men had been drinking but Mr Bell seemed 'happy and cheerful.'

She said: ‘Mr Bell went to the toilet then made his way to the bar. He stopped by Mr Henderson. There was an exchange of words but very quiet not aggressive.

‘And then Mr Henderson punched him on his left cheek. That didn't really do anything apart from shock Mr Bell. He then gave him another punch and I saw blood and Mr Bell went down on the floor.’

The court heard Henderson and Miss Caplan are now no longer together. The case, which is expected to last three days, continues.
