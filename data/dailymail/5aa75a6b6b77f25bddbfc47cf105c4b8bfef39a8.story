A third teenager has been arrested in connection with the gang rape of a 12-year-old girl after handing himself in.

The girl was approached by three men shortly after midnight on Saturday, July 27, before being taken to a set of disused garages in Walthamstow, east London, where two of them raped her.

Two 17-year-old boys, who cannot be named, for legal reasons, appeared at Thames Magistrates Court on Saturday charged with raping the girl.
