Eidur Gudjohsen made his long-awaited return for Bolton on Monday night as the veteran forward came through 90 minutes unscathed, as the second string Wanderers' side fell to a narrow 2-1 defeat against Middlesbrough.  

The 36-year-old, a free agent after leaving Belgian side Club Brugge at the end of last season, has been training with the Championship side to maintain his fitness.

And Wanderers fans were able to see their former hero in action for the first time since his return to the club, as he played in an advanced midfield role against Boro under the watchful eye of Trotters boss Neil Lennon.

Gudjohnsen showed glimpses of his class throughout, but would have been disappointed not to have got on the scoresheet after fluffing two golden opportunities, one of which was from point blank range in the first half. 

Despite not getting on the scoresheet, the experienced frontman would have been delighted to have remained on the pitch for the entirety of the game, creating numerous goalscoring opportunities for his team-mates in the second half in particular.

Gudjohnsen is now expected to pen a short-term deal with the club within the next 48 hours.

The Icelandic striker previously spent two years at the then Reebok Stadium between 1998 and 2000, scoring 26 goals in the process before sealing a big-money move to Chelsea.

Bolton have been in impressive form since former Celtic boss Lennon has taken over - winning five of their last eight Championship games - so Gudjohnsen will not be guaranteed a first-team place if he does sign for the Trotters.
