Tesco supermarkets prove to be the worst for hygiene after it was revealed that 29 of its stores failed inspections aimed to protect customers from food poisoning.

It was one of five big supermarket chains that saw stores fall foul of basic checks from the Food Standards Agency (FSA), according to figures from between 2012 and 2013 that were published in the Sun.

Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi also had stores that failed to meet expected standards, according to the data.

Tesco supermarkets prove to be worst for hygiene after 29 stores failed inspections aimed to protect customers from food poisoning between 2012 and 2013, according to figures published by the Sun

Lidl and Waitrose were the only two 'big seven' chains which saw all stores pass.

The FSA reviewed hygiene practices at a total of 11,106 supermarkets in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Of that number, 510 did not maintain standard levels of hygiene.

The data, which is regularly updated on the agency's website, reflects the standards of food hygiene found on the date of inspection or visit by the relevant local authority.

Each premises is given a rating between zero and five - with two or below indicating that it does not meet the expected standards.

Of the 1,789 Tesco stores that were reviewed, five received a 'one' rating. Of the 440 Asda stores that were inspected, five failed. Four of Sainsbury's 994 stores did not pass.

Just two of the 516 Morrisons supermarkets inspected were found inadequate and one of Aldi's 382 inspected stores failed.

All other 'fails' received by big chain supermarkets, including the 24 other Tesco stores, were awarded at a 'two' grade.

Lidl and Waitrose were the only two of the 'big seven' supermarket chains which saw all stores pass reviews carried out by the local council into their hygiene practices

None of the chains inspected received zero, which would mean that the supermarket is in need of urgent improvement.

A spokesperson for Tesco said: 'We take food safety and store hygiene extremely seriously and ensure all our shops are checked thoroughly on a daily basis. While any reported low score is clearly disappointing , these stores represent just one per cent of our shop estate in the UK.

'Weâ€™d like to reassure customers that when any issues are brought to our attention they are dealt with immediately by store colleagues.'

A spokesperson from Morrisons said: 'We insist on the highest standards of food hygiene in every store, deal with any issues raised immediately and are currently awaiting re-inspection.'

A spokesperson for Waitrose said: 'We have very high standards of hygiene and cleanliness across all areas of our business and we're pleased this has been recognised.'

An Asda 
spokesperson said: 'We expect high standards in every one of our 583 
stores. While we agree the information when these inspections were 
carried out is correct, we don't believe it to be up to date.

'We've
 made improvements in each of these stores and we've requested a further
 audit from the local authorities to get up to date scores - these 
further inspections have yet to be carried out.'

Sainsbury's said this year its stores had scored four or above, according to the Sun.

A
 spokesperson for Lidl said: 'The health and safety of our customers is 
paramount for us and these results show that the business model is 
successfully meeting our objectives.'

Giles
 Hurley, Joint Managing Director of Corporate Buying at Aldi said: 
'Following the FSA visit, all points raised have been addressed and we 
are currently in the process of applying for a rescore to ensure that 
the rating awarded to our premises reflects the high standards that we 
hold ourselves accountable to.'
