Benefits cheat: Vincent Siracusa pocketed thousands of pounds in hand-outs while working as a DJ in venues across the north west

A benefits cheat who swindled the taxpayer out of almost £30,000 by pretending to be unemployed while actually working as a nightclub DJ has been spared jail.

Vincent Siracusa pocketed thousands of pounds in hand-outs while working the bar and club scene as a popular DJ in the north west of England.

A court heard the 58-year-old had legitimately started claiming income support and council tax benefit from 2002.

But he failed to inform the authorities when he begun working as a DJ from August 2004 and went on to earn £80,000 by the end of 2009.

Siracusa was overpaid £25,000 in income support as well as £4,800 in council tax benefit while entertaining at trendy Northern Soul nights as well as pubs in bars.

Yesterday Siracusa avoided jail after pleading guilty to two counts of benefit fraud at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court.

He was sentenced to 36 weeks in prison, suspended for two years and handed a 12- month supervision order and a four-month curfew.

Sentencing, Recorder Nigel Daly told him: 'You are a person who has done charity work, donating almost £2,000 to Help For Heroes.

'You have been involved in other charity events, one raising £1,000 for the Donna Louise Trust.

'But at the same time you have been effectively stealing from the public, receiving £30,000 over about five years.

'At the same time you were working on a regular basis and receiving money, which would have put you as having income in the region of £16,000, none of which was declared to the authorities.'

The court heard Siracusa, of Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., worked at bars and clubs and even performed at functions at Port Vale Football Club.

But he was rumbled by the Department of Work and Pensions after they received an anonymous tip-off from a member of the public.

Prosecutor Fraser Livesey told the court: 'The defendant claimed benefits from 2002.

'They were not dishonest from the outset. He began working from August 2004.

'He would not have been entitled to benefits if he declared his work.

'He was working as a disc jockey at pubs and clubs. He had two bank accounts, one which he used as a cash account, the other appeared to be an account for regular gigs.

'He appears to have worked at Port Vale Football Club in terms of their social functions and he worked at Northern Soul nights.'

Stuart Muldoon, defending, said Siracusa - who has no previous convictions - didn't use all the cash himself and paid others who helped him at events.

He added that the DJ carries out a lot of charitable work which has raised 'not insubstantial' amounts for worthy causes.
