In desperation, they risk violence, dehydration and even death in a bid to enter the United States.

These photos show some of the thousands of Central American migrants who are making the perilous journey across Mexico to reach the border.

Many of the migrants - some entire families, others, unaccompanied children - climb aboard 'La Bestia', or The Beast freight train, to travel north.

They ride precariously on top of the moving containers of the vehicle, known as the 'Train of Death', risking serious injury or death if they fall.

The train, which has gained notoriety, is also increasingly being targeted by criminal gangs, people smugglers, kidnappers and corrupt officials. 

Once at the border, the migrants then swamp temporary holding facilities, leading the Homeland Security Department to release many  into the U.S.. 

However, not all of the migrants manage to complete their treacherous trip to the U.S. - with many perishing without a trace. 

Honduran migrant Blanca Lydia Valenzuela's son Manuel is among the thousands of Central Americans to have vanished while crossing through Mexico.

Yesterday, Ms Valenzuela, 61, wiped away a tear as she explained how she comes to Mexico twice a year to search for her son, who disappeared during an attempt to re-enter America in 2003. He had earlier been deported back to Honduras after working in New Orleans for three years.

Two weeks ago, U.S. President Barack Obama reversed course and delayed taking executive action on immigration reform until after November congressional elections, bowing to concerns it could cost his fellow Democrats control of the U.S. Senate.

Making do: Mr Obama said the surge of nearly 63,000 children from Central America crossing the border to the United States in the past year had made Americans wary of new immigration measures. Above, a Honduran migrant repairs his backpack at the shelter for undocumented immigrants

Mr Obama had promised in a high-profile White House appearance in June to announce unilateral measures by the end of summer if Congress did not enact immigration reform legislation.

But he said the surge of nearly 63,000 children from Central America crossing the border to the United States in the past year had made Americans wary of new immigration measures.

'The truth of the matter is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem,' Mr Obama said in an interview with NBC's 'Meet the Press'.

Mr Obama said he plans to act later this year after making more of a public case for his actions, which are expected to remove the threat of deportation for some of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.
