Former Doctor Who star Matt Smith and his ex-girlfriend Daisy Lowe appear to have become the latest victims of hackers who have leaked naked photographs of celebrities online.

The pair join a long list of stars including Jennifer Lawrence, Avril Lavigne and Rihanna whose personal pictures are believed to have been posted online by anonymous bloggers. 

Smith, who quit his role as the timelord last year, dated former model Lowe for several years but the pair have since split up.

So far, the images - which were first leaked in August - have involved women.

But this week, the fourth bout of images were released and were said to include pictures of the first male victim, Nick Hogan, son of Hulk.

The fourth wave of leaked images comes one week after a lawyer for more than a dozen targeted celebrities issued Google with a threat to sue for $100 million.

The firm threatened action due to Google 'making millions and profiting from the victimisation of women'.

This week, Hollywood star Jennifer Lawrence also broke her silence to hit out at the leak of the naked pictures.

The Oscar-winner, one of the most high-profile victims of the hacking of hundreds of explicit images, said it was a 'sex crime'.

She told Vanity Fair magazine that anyone who looked at the images 'should cower with shame'.

The 24-year-old told the magazine that she started to write a statement, but realised she had nothing to apologise for.

She said: 'I was in a loving, healthy, great relationship for four years. It was long distance, and either your boyfriend is going to look at porn or he's going to look at you.'

She told Vanity Fair: 'Just because I'm a public figure, just because I'm an actress, does not mean that I asked for this.

'It does not mean that it comes with the territory. It's my body, and it should be my choice, and the fact that it is not my choice is absolutely disgusting. I can't believe that we even live in that kind of world.'

Lawrence called for a change in the law to prevent more leaks and added: 'It is not a scandal. It is a sex crime. It is a sexual violation. It's disgusting.

'I just can't imagine being that detached from humanity. I can't imagine being that thoughtless and careless and so empty inside.'

She added: 'Anybody who looked at those pictures, you're perpetuating a sexual offence.' 

Many have surmised that the controversy may be coming to a close given the lower profile of the hacker's latest victims. 

But photos from an unreleased and potentially massive collection of stolen celebrity nudes can still be bought online for $350, evidence shows. 

Some say this summer's celebrity nude leaks were only a peak at how many photos and videos were compromised through security flaws in Apple's iCloud and other platforms.

The latest hits will come as a blow to Apple as the tech firm desperately tries to tighten security on the iCloud. It currently allows users to attempt access to any account an unlimited amount of times.

The FBI and Apple, which runs iCloud, are already investigating the hacking in which dozens of celebrities’ accounts were infiltrated. 

Naked pictures of stars were put online by hackers linked to the notorious online forum 4chan.

The first wave of explicit, personal images were released on August 31, featuring Jennifer Lawrence, Kirsten Dunst, and Kate Upton.

Since, images have surfaced of singers Rihanna and Avril Lavigne, TV actress Kaley Cuoco, American goalkeeper Hope Solo, and socialities Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton.

Another huge wave of leaked images took place around September 20 and involved nude photos of Kim Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens, Kate Bosworth and Hope Solo all being released.  

The hackers also managed to steal pictures of Aubrey Plaza, Hayden Panetierre and Vanessa Hudgens in similar compromising positions.

Also among the victims was British model Cara Delevingne.  

The blogger has also threatened to target Emma Watson - and created a website called Emma You Are Next - after she gave a feminist talk at the UN.

Reddit closed the forum titled Fappening, a lewd reference to masturbation, a week after the first hit after receiving a warning that the images violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

But the images have been cached by thousands of users all over the world and shared on other blogs and websites, meaning many still appear on Google Images.

Marty Singer, half of Lavely & Singer law firm in Los Angeles, California, is now persuing legal action on behalf of a number of A-list victims. 

Singer claims he also issued more than a dozen warning letters to Google but received no response. 

In a letter to Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Singer accused the pair of 'blatantly unethical behavior'. 

Reacting to the potential lawsuit, Google said they have been trying to eradicate the photos from the web in response to complaints about privacy violation.

'We've removed tens of thousands of pictures -- within hours of the requests being made -- and we have closed hundreds of accounts,' a Google spokeman said.

Apple has denied that its iCloud system was compromised during the attacks, which were the result of 'a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions'. 

The firm, which said it was 'outraged' by the security breach, has now advised worried customers to update their accounts with a 'strong' password and enable two-step verification.  

Last month, during a previous leak of stolen, naked pictures, Twitter said it was shutting down accounts disseminating the images. 

In response to a request for comment, a Twitter spokesman said in August: 'We do not comment on individual accounts, for privacy and security reasons,' and referred MailOnline to the company's content boundaries web page.
