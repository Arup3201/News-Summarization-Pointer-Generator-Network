While all eyes were on Novak Djokovic and Stanislas Wawrinka's impressive stroke action during tonight's men's singles semi-final, a spectacular catch from a ball girl raised a cheer from the crowd at the Rod Laver Arena

Kneeling on the left-hand side of the net, the girl was watching the match like a hawk and saw her opportunity to strike when Wawrinka hit a ball her way from his racquet. 

Leaping to her feet, she reached out one hand and managed to gracefully wrap her fingers around the flying ball.

With a cheer from the crowd, the girl resumed her position, acting as if nothing had happened. 

Although she couldn't resist a cheeky smile when she realised she had caught the attention of the famous players.

So far this year a ball boy who was performing his duties was left bent-doubled after a high-power ball from Feliciano Lopez hit him in his private parts.  

Both players stopped the game and checked to see if he was okay before play resumed.

Another ball boy nearly felt the wrath of Rafael Nadal after his water bottle fell over in the wind. 

Nadal is known for his match routines and the ball boy was ready to run over and help him pick up the bottle.
