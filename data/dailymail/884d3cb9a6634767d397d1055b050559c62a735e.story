A teacher who sent a former pupil a topless ‘selfie’ has been banned from classrooms for at least five years.

Linda Harvey, 43, started contacting the 16-year-old boy on Facebook shortly after he left Park High School, in Colne, Lancashire, in July 2012.

The pair then exchanged phone numbers and began sending personal text messages and pictures to each other, the National College for Teaching and Leadership heard.

Mrs Harvey was reported to the school after sending an image of herself ‘bare-breasted’ from the neck down in November 2012.

She resigned from her post before a formal disciplinary hearing took place at the school.

But Mrs Harvey, who had worked at the school since 2002, has now been banned from teaching indefinitely after a Professional Conduct Panel found her actions amounted to ‘unacceptable professional conduct’ and ‘conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute’.

The teacher admitted failing to maintain professional boundaries with her former student, referred to as Pupil A.

In a statement to the NCTL panel, she said: ‘[I would] like to apologise for any upset and distress caused to the ex-pupil who I let down badly throughout the entire incident.

‘Above all it is the impact on him that I am mindful on - as well as the impact on other pupils and the school community as a whole.’

Alison Walsh, chairing the NCTL panel, said her actions were an ‘abuse’ of her ‘position of trust’.

She said: ‘Although the actions occurred after Pupil A had left the school, they involved misconduct in the education setting because the relationship was initiated by Mrs Harvey in her capacity as Pupil A’s teacher.

‘The fact that details of the Facebook and text messages quickly became common knowledge serves to damage public perception of Mrs Harvey and the teaching profession.

‘Teachers have a uniquely influential role and pupils and the public must be able to view teachers as role models in the way they behave.’

But Mrs Harvey - who became a teacher in 2009 after working as a teaching assistant - was cleared of ‘sexually motivated conduct’ after the panel found she had not intended to start an intimate relationship with the boy.

The NCTL panel recommended to the Secretary of State for Education that Mrs Harvey should be barred from teaching for at least five years.

The decision maker on behalf of Nicky Morgan, Paul Heathcote said: ‘Whilst not sexually motivated, Mrs Harvey’s behaviour, and in particular her failure to maintain appropriate boundaries, falls well short of the standards expected and I agree that a prohibition order is a proportionate sanction.

‘Mrs Harvey has shown significant insight and genuine remorse. She has been honest about her behaviour both during the investigation of this case and also with her current employers.

‘I agree with the panel’s recommendation that she should be allowed to apply to have the order set aside after a period of five years has elapsed.

‘This means that Mrs Linda Harvey is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England. 

'She may apply for the Prohibition Order to be set aside, but not until 7 September 2019, five years from the date of this order at the earliest.’
