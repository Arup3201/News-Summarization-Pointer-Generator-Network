Decorated: Andrew Seif was named Marine of the Year in 2013 and was awarded the Silver Star Medal at a ceremony last week

The Black Hawk helicopter that crashed in dense fog during a training mission in Florida was carrying seven Marines from Special Operations Command forces based in North Carolina, and four National Guard soldiers from Louisiana. All are presumed dead.

More bad weather Thursday prevented the recovery of bodies and the flight recorder from wreckage 25 feet deep.  

At least three Marines from Michigan could be among the 11 who were killed.

While the military has not officially released any names, local sources and family members have told local news outlets about loved ones that were on the doomed copter.

Marine Andrew Seif was one of the eleven who lost his life. 

He's credited with risking his life to save a wounded team member while both faced heavy enemy fire during a 2012 deployment to Afghanistan.

Seif, 27, is a critical skills operator with 2d Marine Special Operations Battalion, U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Special Operations Command.

He was named Marine of the Year in 2013 and was awarded the Silver Star Medal at a ceremony last week. 

Seif was recognized for aiding a wounded team member while coming under enemy fire in Afghanistan in 2012.

Dreams dashed: Bawol was set to get married to Erika Lynn Hipple in October. Another Marine, Andrew Seif was to be his best man. He was also killed in the crash

Killed: Marcus Bawol, 27, lived in Warren, Michigan. His family confirmed he's among the dead

Marcus Bawol, of Warren was also on the helicopter. 

Bawol 'loved everything about the military,' said his sister, Brandy Peek.

'He couldn't wait to join. He wanted to fight for our country and was always striving to be the best Marine he could be.'

The 27-year-old graduated in 2006 from Warren Mott High School. Bawol played baseball and football and was a member of the school's swim team, according to district Superintendent Robert Livernois.

Bawol attended Olivet College for a year, where he was a catcher on the baseball team.

He had planned to marry his fiancée in October, Peek said.

On Thursday, Warren Mayor Jim Fouts ordered flags in the city, just north of Detroit, flown at half-staff. 

Kerry Kemp was the proud father of a baby just shy of her first birthday and loved horsing around with his nephews. 

'He would wrestle with them. He really got into that, the wrestling and playing. He'd carry them around on his back,' said his sister-in-law, Lora Waraksa.

He was a 'proud Marine, a loving husband and most wonderful father,' she said.

 He also loved golfing and the ocean - he often took his nephews out to hunt for sea shells.

He was stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.

Lost: Kemp met his wife, Jenna, at Port Washington High School in Wisconsin, where he was voted 'best smile' by his senior class

Marine Trevor Blaylock of Orion Township, Michigan also perished.

Blaylock's friend, Chris Lagona, told Click on Detroit that he was the ultimate family man. 

He had a wife and two daughters, 'Once (Trevor) joined the Marines, that became his life, besides his wife and daughters. They were all he ever talked about. Nothing meant more to him than those three,' said Lagona.

Hearts are heavy at the Lake Orion United Methodist Church where his family worshipped.

'He was very imaginative and adventuresome,' said Donna Waite, the Director of Children's Ministries at the church. 'I remember him riding his skateboard through the halls of the church.'

Donna Waite said Blaylock talked about how he found meaning and pride in his service.

'It was a quiet pride, because being in that special unit he could not talk about what he was doing, so most people at the church did not know. We knew he was in a special ops unit, but that was it,' said Donna to WXYZ.

Perished: 30-year-old Trevor Blaylock from Lake Orion, Michigan was also killed. He leaves behind a wife and two little girls

Prayers: Retired Army Lt. Col. Rachel Coggins takes part in a  candlelight memorial service honoring the victims of the helicopter crash in an Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crash is held Wednesday evening

Remembering: Associated pastor Trey Rose holds up his hand as a candlelight memorial service honoring the victims of the crash. 11 members of the Louisiana National Guard were on a routine nighttime training mission

The National Guard soldiers, from Hammond, Louisiana, each did two tours in Iraq, and joined in humanitarian missions after Gulf Coast hurricanes and the BP oil spill, their commanders said.

All the Marines were 'seasoned combat veterans' who did tours in Iraq before joining the 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion in Afghanistan, where they were training local military and police, said Capt. Barry Morris, spokesman for the Marine Corps Special Operations Command at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

These 'unconventional warriors' train constantly to endure grueling conditions and sensitive assignments on land and at sea, from seizing ships to special reconnaissance missions and direct action inside hostile territory. 

Their practice Tuesday involved 'insertion and extraction missions,' using small boats and helicopters to move in and out of a target site.

Debris: Pentagon officials say the 11 on board are presumed and that the mission is now one of search and recover. Above, a door or window and wheel from the helicopter

Meanwhile, divers have found the wreckage of the military helicopter in just 25 feet of water. 

'It was certainly a high-impact crash,' said Eglin Fire Chief Mark Giuliano, and 'very, very, very dense fog' was complicating the response.

 There's almost no visibility at the spot where the wreckage was found, forcing search crews to move slowly to avoid colliding with each other, and the surf is too rough still to pull the wreckage to the surface.

Dozens of airmen walked the shores of Santa Rosa Sound Thursday, recovering pieces of clothing and bits of wreckage, but the U.S. Coast Guard suspended its search Thursday afternoon, and will instead focus on helping the Army recover the remaining fuselage and debris, it said. 

President Barack Obama has promised a thorough investigation into the cause, which is being led by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center out of Fort Rucker, Alabama.

Washed up: Parts thought to be from the helicopter have continued to land on the beach, including this wheel

The helicopter went down Tuesday night in fog so thick that another helicopter turned back. 

A woman at campground nearby, Kim Urr, said she heard a metallic sound and then two muffled explosions as it disappeared into the narrow waterway separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida panhandle mainland.

This dense sea fog, which could persist through Friday, is common when warm southern air meets cold water this time of year, said Jack Cullen, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mobile, Alabama.

The same fog enveloped a large gathering holding a vigil on a pier Wednesday night. 

Crashing Gulf waves created a somber backdrop to the songs, tears and prayers of the people, who have strong ties to the military and the sprawling Eglin Air Force Base.

'My heart is really hurt right now knowing these people were here just on training - knowing they went and left their family members and did not give that goodbye, you know, because they weren't going off to war,' said a tearful Dolly Edwards, herself the wife of a Marine.
