A father and daughter who were separated for 43 years reunited earlier this month, only for him to die two days later.

Mary Garcia flew 4,600 miles from Texas to Kirkcaldy, Fiife, to meet her father who she had not seen since her parents split up in 1971.

By then Jim McKelvie, 66, was dying of cancer and passed away holding his daughter's hand 48 hours after she arrived.

Jim McKelvie kept this picture of himself and his daughter, Maria Garcia, with him from the moment they separated 43 years ago up until their reunion two days before his death

Mr McKelvie and Mrs Garcia last saw each other in 1971 when she and her mother moved to the US

Mr McKelvie, a former soldier, split up with Mrs Garcia's mother when her daughter was two years old and she moved to live in the US.

The pair then went without contact for 43 years, but Mr McKelvie kept a picture of him and his daughter with him at all times.

His ex-wife, Maria, finally got back in touch on social media six months ago.

But just a few months later, the devastating news came through that Mr McKelvie was terminally ill.

The father and daughter saw each other for the first time for more than four decades during a video call, after which Mrs Garcia dropped everything and flew to Scotland.

Jim's granddaughter, Claire Houston, from Dunfermline, Fife, said: 'In September he took very ill and was taken into hospital where he was for two weeks, then we got the heartbreaking news that he had terminal cancer.

'I immediately contacted Mary and told her the sad news and we agreed to stay in touch to keep her up to date on his progress.

'I then asked her if she would be willing to visit as it would be the greatest gift I could give to him - and she told me she would think about it as it was a huge decision.

Holding hands: Although he was too weak to speak, Mr McKelvie was said to be delighted when his daughter arrived in hospital, holding his hand until he died

Claire Houston, pictured with Mr McKelvie - her grandfather - on her wedding day, said it was 'so wonderful' that the pair were able to meet again

'The following week I took my iPad into the hospital and we FaceTimed Mary in America - it was a beautiful and emotional day.

'That night Mary told me that she was going to come over and we booked her on a flight for the next day.

'She arrived just in time on October 2. It was just wonderful and we connected straight away.'

Mrs Garcia's surprise visit delighted Mr McKelvie, who was too weak too talk by the time his daughter arrived.

Ms Houston, 36, who is Jim's granddaughter from another marriage, said: 'By this time my grandfather wasn't able to talk, walk, eat or drink and he opened his eyes only rarely, but he held Mary's hand and knew she was there.

'Myself, my mum and Mary were holding his hands when he passed away on the Saturday.

'I will miss him terribly but I am glad he was part of my life. He would have been so proud of Mary and I.

'Sometimes when you meet someone for the first time it can be a bit awkward, but it wasn't and we connected immediately. We are definitely going to keep in touch as much as we can and I am hopefully going to visit her in Texas and she hopes to visit again. 

'It's just so wonderful that they were able to meet again after so long.'
