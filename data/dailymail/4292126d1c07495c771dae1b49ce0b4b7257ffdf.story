Joe Scarborough earns $99,038 a week from his morning show, but his ex-wife will only see a 'tiny fraction' of it, according to the couple's divorce documents.

The MSNBC Morning Joe host will not be required to pay child support for their two young children and his alimony payments will be minimal, reports TMZ.

The revelations come after news broke Thursday that Scarborough, 50, had quietly filed for divorce from his wife of 12 years Susan Waren in September last year.

Over: Joe Scarborough married his second wife 
Susan Waren in 2001 and their separation proceedings began last fall 
before being finalized in January

According to TMZ, the former Florida congressman gave Waren a once-off payment of $150,000 following the split. He will now be required to pay her $30,000 a month for the next five years, then $25,000 per month for two years.

Scarborough is also paying off the couple's home in Connecticut as well as for their children Kate, 10, and five-year-old Jack's education.

The divorce was kept very quiet as the legal separation papers were filed last year, but news of the spilt was not made public until this week. 

Scarborough and Waren finalised the divorce in January of this year in Connecticut and a source told The Huffington Post that he is described as a ‘faithful, devoted and committed father and husband’ in the legal filings.

The pair are said to still be living together with their children, and allegedly have 'house rules' when they are both in their Connecticut home.

Neither Scarborough or Waren are allowed to enter each other's bedrooms, unless there is a problem related to their children, reports TMZ.

They also each have their own side of the house, and after 7pm each night they are prohibited from crossing onto the other's side.

Scarborough has two sons from his first marriage, Joey and Andrew, who are both in their 20s.

He has made no public statements about the split.

Part of the reason the separation and divorce went unnoticed was that Scarborough continued to wear his wedding ring on television through the summer, even after everything was finalized in January.

The divorce revelation leaked just one day after the NY Post revealed that Joe and his MSNBC cohost Mika Brzezinski are in talks to take over Weekend Today's Sunday show on NBC.

The pair almost left MSNBC two years ago to take over CBS's morning show.

Shared interests: Joe was a Republican congressman from Florida earlier in his career and Susan worked for Jeb Bush

After nearly four years hosting a primetime show, Scarborough debuted as the host of the eponymous Morning Joe in May of 2007.

Mika, a married mother with two daughters, was officially hired as his cohost soon after.

News of Joe's divorce comes twelves years after he and Susan married in October 2001. She had worked as an aide to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. 

The family first moved north from Florida to the Upper West Side for his job at MSNBC, and then several years ago settled in Connecticut, where the paperwork was filed.

Months before his wedding he resigned from Congress early in his fourth term as a Republican from Florida, citing his need to be home in Pensacola with his children.

He was divorced from his first wife Melanie at the time but the pair shared joint custody of their then young sons.

‘The
 realisation has come home to me that they're at a critical stage of 
their lives and I would rather be judged at the end of my life as a 
father than as a congressman,’ he said.

Scarborough has spoken about his second son Andrew’s struggles with both juvenile diabetes and Asperger’s.

In 2008 he shared the very premature birth of his son Jack and his road to health with viewers.

He dedicates his Twitter bio to his role as a father: ‘Daddy to Kate & Jack, ATM to Joey & Andrew.’

First elected to Congress in 1994, he was
 an unknown Republican in a historically Democratic district. He was 
reelected three times before leaving.

Before he ran for Congress and again when he left, before taking a job at MSNBC, Scarborough worked as a lawyer.

He and first wife Melanie Hinton, his college sweetheart from the University of Alabama, wed in 1986. They then moved to Gainesville, where he attended the University of Florida law school, and then settled in Pensacola, where he ran for office.

Their divorce was finalised in 1999.
