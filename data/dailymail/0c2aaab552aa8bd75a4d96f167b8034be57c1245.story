Nick Clegg has come under fresh fire for ‘distancing’ his party from the Government over his no-show for the budget.

The stinging criticism from former Home Office minister Jeremy Browne came after the deputy leader shunned Wednesday’s Autumn Statement.

While Chancellor George Osborne took to his feet in Parliament, the Deputy Prime Minister travelled to Penzance in Cornwall to discuss flood defences.

Criticism: Nick Clegg has come under fresh fire for ‘distancing’ his party from the Government over his no-show for the budget

The Daily Telegraph reported Mr Browne as saying: ‘My party shouldn’t go to too great a length to distance itself from a winning combination.

‘The danger is we cast ourselves with one foot in government, one foot out. We don’t get support from people who think the Government has done a good job.

‘We should not run away from our record, because we will not get the credit and continue to get the blame.

‘I don’t want us to move from being a party of protest to a party of protest in government.’

Mr Clegg yesterday insisted his trip to Cornwall was not a snub to the government, saying it was a ‘nice change to get out of the Westminster bubble and see what this Autumn statement means to people’.

When asked by the newspaper if was ‘a bit childish’ of the Lib Dem leader not to turn up for the Autumn Statement, Mr Browne said: ‘I think it is important for the Liberal Democrats to have a distinctive appeal at the general election, to explain to people the relevance and purpose of our party, and why it is necessary to vote for us for the furtherance of the national interest.’

He added: ‘I also think it is important for us that we are unambiguously associated with the Government that we are members of. 

'We are just as much part of the Government as the Conservatives are the Government.’

Mr Browne made the criticisms when he appeared on the TaxPayers’ Alliance and Institute of Economic Affairs panel.

He added: ‘And I think if you have a big political event in Parliament and one of our Cabinet ministers is unequivocally enthusiastic about it, one of our Cabinet ministers appears to be very unenthusiastic about it and another of our Cabinet ministers is absent, that creates a sense that we are not as unambiguously supportive of the Government that we are members of, which I think we need to be to get the credit we deserve for a lot of the Government’s achievements.’
