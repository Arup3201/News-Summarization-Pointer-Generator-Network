Debts: Society dress designer Tabitha Webb is facing claims from suppliers that she owes thousands of pounds in unpaid bills for goods and services

A society dress designer favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge and her sister Pippa Middleton is facing claims from suppliers that she owes thousands of pounds in unpaid bills for goods and services. 

Among the claimants is a courier firm that accuses Tabitha Webb of owing more than £17,000 in bills  dating back to 2007.

Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday also reveal that the collapse of one of the companies she set up to operate her fashion business has left her with outstanding debts of more than £250,000 – and that none of those companies is a going concern.

The news will come as a shock to Kate and Pippa, as well as to such other high-profile clients as TV presenter and model Kelly Brook. 

Ms Webb came to worldwide  attention last year when the Duchess of Cambridge wore one of her creations – a simple floral summer dress – on a visit to Australia with Prince William.

She attracted further attention when Pippa Middleton wore a Webb-designed dress  at the wedding of James Meade and Lady Laura Marsham in Norfolk earlier this month.

Her foundering company, Ragdoll Management, was behind a fashion range Ms Webb launched three years ago with her best friend, the singer and former X Factor judge Dannii Minogue. 

The collection, named Project D, focused on easy-to-wear dresses that were on sale at Selfridges and Harvey Nichols. 

At its launch, Ms Minogue said: ‘What I really want to get across is that this is not a celebrity brand.

People might say, “Oh what the  hell is she doing?” And you know what, I agree with them. What the hell am I doing? This is the biggest putting-your-a***-on-the-line thing  I could ever do.’

But in July, Ms Minogue announced that she was ending her involvement in the brand.

Now it has emerged that Ragdoll Management is about to be struck off the Companies House register and is five months late in filing  its accounts.

Another of Ms Webb’s companies, Dollybird Ltd, is dormant and has only £100 in the bank, according to its latest accounts.

The first company she founded, Tabitha Webb Ltd, went into liquidation in May 2007, owing more than £214,000 to business creditors and a further £60,000 to the taxman.

Courier firm CSM Logistics, which was used to ferry clothes and handbags between venues, says it was left £8,600 out of pocket by Tabitha Webb Ltd and that another transport firm in the CSM group, Sandrair, is owed £8,700.

A CSM spokesman said: ‘We have sent registered letters to all her addresses but there has been no response. We have told her that if she doesn’t pay what she owes us, we are entitled to sell her stock.’

Ms Webb, 38, lives in a £1 million house in Wandsworth, South London, with her South African-born husband, business consultant Gavin Ferrar, and their daughter Betsey Belle.

In an interview with The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine three weeks ago, she said the family have a six-week holiday in South Africa every Christmas and own a cottage in Cornwall.

Ms Webb’s solicitors, London firm Lee & Thompson, said: ‘Tabitha Somerset Webb has had a long career in fashion design and over this time has set up a number of different companies. 

‘Tabitha is currently producing made-to-measure dresses and is  in the process of launching a new range, under the brand name of Tabitha Webb.’
