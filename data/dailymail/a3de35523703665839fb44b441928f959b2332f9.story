The parents of missing mother Susan Powell are searching her father-in-law's former home in the hope that it will give some clues to her whereabouts.

Chuck and Judy Cox went into convicted 'peeping Tom' Steven Powell's Washington home over the weekend, where they unearthed a box containing computer-coding files, among other, more personal items that belonged to their grandchildren, who were killed by their father in February 2012.

The Coxes now hope that the coding files might contain information that could help the FBI reach information on a heavily-encrypted computer that was owned by Susan's husband, Josh Powell.

They say they are not sure if her body could be found at the home, but they are bringing in cadaver dogs for the first time to check.

Hope: Chuck Cox, the father of missing mother Susan Powell, shows the side of the house of Steven Powell, which they are searching with the permission of the new owners

Missed: Cox holds a sign previously belonging to his missing daughter and her husband, Josh, who died in 2012

'I don't know if we'll find her here 
or not, but I know I have to continue the search, and this house has 
never been searched by dogs,' Chuck Cox said.

The couple and other helpers, including the authors of a book
 about the case, have also discovered other more personal items, 
including a beloved children's book, items of clothing and bicycle 
helmets.

'It is sickening to see so many reminders
 of Susan and her boys left behind by Steven Powell's family,' author Gregg Olsen
told The Huffington Post.

'To the Powells, those things appear to 
be nothing more than junk. It indicates just how much they really cared 
about the boys and their mother.'

The family, who have been demanding answers since Susan vanished in 2009, will continue to search the home with help from volunteers over the coming weeks.

Where is she? Susan Powell, pictured with her sons Braden and Charlie, vanished in 2009, aged 28

Evidence? They said that a box containing computer-coding files could help them get into heavily encrypted files on Josh Powell's computer. The police have unsuccessfully tried to get into it for years

Treasures: They have also come across mementos -
 such as books and clothing - of their two grandsons, who were killed by
 their father in 2012 after he blew up their home - also killing himself

Steven Powell's home was recently sold
 as part of restitution to the parents of the girls he took naked 
pictures of while they were in their bathroom next door.

Law enforcement found the sordid 
photographs of the little girls, aged eight and 10, while looking for evidence of his missing daughter-in-law.

He was released from prison in March after serving two years for taking photographs of two girls, aged eight and ten in 2011.

Powell
 is on probation for 30 months, required to wear a GPS locator and 
attend a sex-offender treatment program. He lives in Tacoma, according 
to the corrections facility.

Search: The couple believes Steven Powell, who was later jailed for voyeurism charges, knows more information about their daughter's disappearance than he has said

Uncertainties: The couple have said they do not know if their daughter's body will be found at the house

Discoveries: The couple have found reminders of their grandsons in the home, such as this sled, left. They hope that files and other items in the home could give them clues about when their daughter is

The two girls victimized by Powell were awarded a $1.8million settlement as part of a civil suit.

During Powell's voyeurism trial, the girls' parents became friends with Chuck and Judy Cox and, after they were given the home, they agreed to allow a private search of the home with dogs.

Anne Bremner, the neighbors' lawyer, told MailOnline: 'Chuck is never giving up hope.'

She added that the family do not know whether Mrs Cox Powell is alive or dead.

It appears that cadaver dogs were not 
used to search the home at the time because they were not covered by 
warrants obtained by West Valley Police and Pierce County Sheriff's 
Department to go into Powell's property, Ms Bremner said.

'They didn't have the access we have now, they only had narrowly tailored warrants,' the attorney explained.

The mother-of-two Susan Powell, 28, disappeared from her home in West Valley City in December 2009. She has never been found.

Josh has claimed that his wife was at 
home when he took his sons, Charlie and Braden, on a winter camping trip
 in Utah's West Desert.

The Cox family claims that Steven Powell has information about his missing daughter-in-law. It was suspected that she was killed by her husband Josh Powell but he never faced charges in the case.

In 2012, he attempted to murder his 
sons, Charles, seven, and five-year-old Braden with a hatchet before 
setting his home alight, killing them and himself.

What did he know? Powell, pictured after his wife vanished, reportedly ordered his wife around in their home

Theories: The new insights were shared by 
friends in a book out Tuesday, left. It also suggests that one of the 
sons may have been sexually assaulted by Josh's father Steve, pictured 
in court, right

In a new book, 'If I Canâ€™t Have You: Susan Powell, Her Mysterious Disappearance, and the Murder of Her Children', friends claimed Josh Powell poisoned his wife before she vanished, kept food from their sons and even sexually abused the young boys.

Two weeks ago, cadaver dogs were used in a privately-funded and volunteer-based search of a rural home close to Salem, Oregon for signs of Susan Cox Powell.

Her husband's aunt and uncle had been renting the property at the time of her disappearance in 2009. No signs of Susan's remains were found.
