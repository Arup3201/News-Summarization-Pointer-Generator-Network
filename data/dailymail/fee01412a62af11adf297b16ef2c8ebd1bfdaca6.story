Cindy and Rob Harris have undergone a year of IVF to carefully select their next child – the baby that will save their son’s life.

Gold Coast toddler, 22-month-old Ryven, was born with the extremely rare genetic condition Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), which deteriorates his quality of life and could be fatal.

The average life expectancy of a male with WAS is 15 to 20 years.

An excited Ryven announces the news of the new sibling that will come into the world in March 2015 - who will not only add to their family but answer his family's prayers. The new baby boy will be the genetic donor match Ryven desperately needs

Cindy and Rob Harris are excited to welcome their second child, a son, in March 2015, who will be the genetic match for their son Ryven. Their new son will hopefully save Ryven's life

Ryven was born with the extremely rare genetic condition Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome and diagnosed at 12 weeks. His parents feared he would never leave the hospital

Ryven, who will turn two on December 28, has not had an easy start to life but is a happy boy with a beautiful smile, who with the love and support of his parents will hopefully be able to go to school and lead a positive and normal life

Ryven is quite literally one in a million, with only one to ten cases of WAS per million males worldwide.

His only hope for a cure is a bone marrow transplant, except the toddler has a very rare blood type and can not find a match, despite being on a registry of 15 million people.

When Cindy and Rob couldn’t find a solution, they turned to IVF and the wonders of modern medicine to make the perfect match their son needs to stay alive.

They decided to have a baby to save their son.

It was difficult, expensive and ‘an emotional rollercoaster’ but the Harris family knew they would do anything to help their little boy.

Ryven's parents campaigned for blood donation, when their son urgently needed a platelet transfusion but the Australian Red Cross blood bank were nearly completely out of Ryven's blood type

In 24 hours, more than 5000 people responsed to the call for action - to join 'Team Ryven'

After four rounds of IVF, the couple are thrilled to be expecting another little boy who will have a special and unique bond with his brother, knowing that they were picked for each other.

‘It’s a gamble, we know that and it’s one we’re willing to take because we’ll get to save our little boy and we get another beautiful baby,’ Ms Harris told The Today Show.

‘We’re fortunate because we get to put Ryven through a transplant with a 12 out of 12 perfect match, which is extremely hard to find.’

When the baby is born, the cord blood will be saved for Ryven.

Ryven needs to be very careful, but by all accounts is a joyful little boy with a love of life. Ryven’s body struggles to make platelets, which means his blood is not able to clot properly.Even the slightest bump can cause serious bruising and hematomas

Later, when Ryven needs a bone marrow transplant, he will have ‘a 12 out of 12 match’, which is the best possible outcome.

To conceive a baby with the same blood type as Ryven, doctors needed to find an embryo with an identical tissue match.

‘The scientists are amazing because the gene that I carry is not going to be passed onto the new baby,’ Ms Harris told The Today Show.

‘He’s going to be a healthy boy with, touchwood, no complications.’

Even the slightest bump can cause serious bruising and hematomas.

With Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), Ryven is at risk of excessive bleeding or haemorrhaging.

Ryven also has a weak immune system, which prevents him from being as social as most children.

‘At the moment he’s very isolated and he can’t go to day care,’ said Mr Harris.

‘Our dream is for him to go to school one day and have some friends.’

Although he is a vibrant little boy, Ryven was given an incredibly difficult start to life, with his parents unsure if he would ever leave the hospital.

His struggles with WAS were made even more life-threatening by his incredibly rare blood type.

A year ago, Ryven was fighting for his life in hospital when the Australian Red Cross blood bank almost ran out of his specific blood type, O-negative CMB-negative.

His parents made a plea on The Today Show for the public to donate blood, platelets and join the bone marrow registry – particularly those with the same blood type as Ryven.

Within 24 hours, the Red Cross had received more than 5000 calls and 2000 online enquiries about donation.

It was the busiest day in the call centre since the Black Saturday fires.

Thanks to the campaign for Ryven, for the first time ever, O negative blood supplies are at an adequate level.

The couple, with the help of friends and family, have started the Ryven Foundation to support Wiskott-Aldrich Patients .

They are campaigning to raise awareness and funds, so people understand how the choice to donate blood can be the difference between life and death.

‘To donate blood marrow isn’t actually scarry. It’s a couple of injections, a blood transfusion through a tube and that’s it,’ Ms Harris told The Today Show.

‘If we can get the message out there that that’s what it is and that will save a life, I think a lot more people will get on the registry.’

They are thrilled about the imminent arrival of their second child, who will have a unique and special bond with his brother Ryven – after all, they were picked especially for each other.

They can’t wait to welcome their child into the world, who they say ‘will be a hero for life'.

Ryven's parents have campaigned solidly to help their son, other Wiskott-Aldritch Syndrome sufferers and to raise awareness about the importance of blood donation and signing up to be a bone marrow donor

They have organised many activities, campaigns and events to raise awareness and funds, all with the colour red - 'red for Ryven'
