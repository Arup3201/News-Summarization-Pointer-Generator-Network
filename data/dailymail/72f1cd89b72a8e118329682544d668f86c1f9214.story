Alan Pardew will sign his contract to become the new Crystal Palace manager at their training ground on Friday afternoon.

The 53-year-old is taking the session at their Beckenham training centre in the morning and will sign his deal to become the new man in charge later in the day.

Palace and Newcastle United are both expected to make formal announcements confirming the appointment.

Pardew's media presentation may yet be delayed further, but as it stands there are no hurdles to his appointment.

One of the reasons for the delay is the two clubs continue to thrash out the detail over Pardew's backroom staff.

Pardew wants Ben Stevens - Newcastle's head of performance and analysis - to join him at Selhurst Park and this is holding up the announcement.

Pardew was in the stands at Villa Park on New Year's Day as Crystal Palace played out 0-0 draw with Aston Villa.

But Keith Millen, who was in temporary charge of the Eagles for the game, insisted that he had no involvement with the team ahead of the kick-off. 

‘He had no input before the game or during,’ said Millen. 

‘He came down after, shook everyone’s hands and was pleased and proud of what he’d seen. But we need to add goals to stay up.

‘He knows we need a different dimension. I’m sure he will have talked to the chairman about transfers. We know we need to bring in players.’ 

Pardew's first match in charge of Palace will be the FA Cup clash away at Dover Athletic on Sunday.
