A Spanish judge has moved closer to charging Princess Cristina (pictured arriving at court in February) in a tax fraud and money-laundering investigation centring on her husband

A Spanish judge has moved closer to charging Princess Cristina, the sister of newly proclaimed King Felipe, in a tax fraud and money-laundering investigation involving her husband.

Palma de Mallorca investigative magistrate Jose Castro today kept Cristina on a list of suspects he thinks should stand trial as he wrapped up a four-year pre-trial investigation.

The judge said Cristina is suspected of two counts of co-operation in tax fraud and one of money-laundering. He said her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, is accused of embezzlement and fraud. Neither has been formally charged.

Prosecutors and defendants will study the ruling and present their accusations or arguments. The judge will then decide on what charges to bring, a step not likely to occur before September.

In court appearances, Princess Cristina and her husband have denied wrongdoing.

The state prosecutor has long opposed having Cristina as a suspect and has said he will appeal Castro's ruling.

The case centres on allegations that Urdangarin used his Duke of Palma title to embezzle some 6 million euros ($8 million dollars) in public contracts through the Noos Institute, a non-profit foundation he and a business partner set up that channeled money to other businesses, including Aizoon, a company he owned with Cristina.

The decision in the case comes less than a week after Cristina's elder brother, Felipe, was proclaimed king following the abdication of his father Juan Carlos.

The 76-year-old Juan Carlos said he was stepping aside after a four-decade reign so younger royal blood could energize the country.

But the fraud case involving his daughter and other scandals had seriously tarnished the royal family's image.

Cristina,
 49, became the first Spanish royal to be questioned in court since the 
monarchy was restored in 1975 when she testified in the case in 
February.

Commenting on the judge's decision, the Royal Palace would only say it had 'full respect for the independence of the judiciary.'

The royal family has lost favour after a series of scandals, including the Noos case, as Spaniards battle economic hardship and high unemployment, though Felipe has distanced himself from his sister and remained untouched by the case.

Polls have showed King Juan Carlos' surprise abdication at 76 and his decision to hand over to his 46-year-old son have boosted the monarchy's popularity. Juan Carlos' elephant hunting trip at the height of Spain's financial crisis in 2012 had damaged his standing.

Princess Cristina did not attend last week's coronation, and she and Urdangarin have been barred from official royal events since the investigation gathered pace.
