Militant union leaders failed in their campaign to bring Britain to its knees yesterday.

David Cameron dismissed as a ‘damp squib’ a strike billed as the biggest for a generation.

With picket lines sparsely populated, only a quarter of civil servants took action, the NHS suffered minimal disruption and Britain’s borders operated more smoothly than normal. JobCentres remained open, courts were sitting, rubbish was collected and driving tests  went ahead.

Packed: The combination of striking workers and children off school meant thousands descended on the Trafford Centre in Manchester yesterday, triggering a pre-Christmas mini sales boom

Extra
time off: The Trafford Centre saw a rise in numbers that meant the 11,500 capacity car park struggled to cope

In Scotland, Glasgow's Silverburn shopping centre reported 15,000 extra visitors than on a normal weekday

However, schools were severely affected, with almost two in three in England closing their doors, forcing many parents to take a day off work or make emergency childcare arrangements.

Union barons insisted the strike, over reforms to generous public sector pensions, had been a ‘historic’ success and claimed two million joined the action. That figure was rubbished by the Cabinet Office, which said it was a wild exaggeration and probably only half that.

Ministers appear emboldened by the failure of the action to cripple the country as unions had threatened.

In some parts of the country, the combination of striking workers and parents trying to entertain their children on a day off from school triggered a pre-Christmas mini sales boom. Car parks were packed at shopping centres throughout the country.

At the Trafford Centre, near Manchester, there were long queues in the 11,500 capacity car park as families waited to go home.

Two civilian police workers had 
travelled to the centre after an hour on the picket line. A male 
fingerprint officer, aged 42, who wouldn’t give his name, said: ‘We’re 
here to do some Christmas shopping as we’re on strike.’

His female co-worker, 39, added: ‘I can’t believe it - it’s full of strikers and people with kids.’

Also there was a 26-year-old teacher whose secondary school was closed because of the strike. Clutching three bags, he said: ‘We needed to make a stand but it’s nice to have a day off to buy some presents.

‘I’ve treated myself to some new jeans as well.’

A spokesperson for the centre said: 'Christmas is well and truly underway at The Trafford Centre today, as people take advantage of a mid-week day off.

'Manchester has experienced a huge jump in footfall, compared to the same day last year.'

In Gateshead’s thronged MetroCentre, sisters Antonia Howard, 27, and Natasha Plews, 19, who both work for Durham Council, were weighed down by ten shopping bags each – but denied accusations of hypocrisy.

Miss Howard, who refused to cross a picket line for her job in the council’s regeneration department, said: ‘If people see this as an excuse for public-sector workers to have a day off and come shopping, what they have to remember is that we are losing a day’s pay. So it isn’t a day off and there is a good reason for it.’

A spokesperson for the MetroCentre said: ‘It has been a very, very busy day today.’

A spokesman for Brent Cross Shopping Centre, north-west London, said: 'We’ve had a lot of families and parents who have had to look after their kids because of the strike it’s been a great day.

'It’s felt a bit like a busy weekend not a week day.'

In the Commons, Mr Cameron launched an extraordinary attack on Labour leader Ed Miliband for expressing sympathy with the strike, describing him as ‘irresponsible,  left-wing and weak’ and claiming the unions paid him to ask questions. Amid increasing signs that senior Tories want to tighten union law, the Prime Minister vowed to end the £130million-a-year taxpayer funding for the salaries of union officials in  the workplace.

Other Cabinet ministers want to go further, and are proposing changes to introduce a new threshold for strike ballots to be legitimate and to make strikers give employers more notice of their intention to withdraw their labour.

Mr Cameron said he thought  the Government had made a ‘very reasonable, very fair offer to  public-sector workers’, pointing out that a nurse earning £34,000 would currently retire on an  annual pension of £17,000 but would get £22,000 after the Government’s reforms, though money would  be saved through increased  contributions and later  retirement ages.

‘I don’t want to see any strikes, but this government has to make responsible decisions,’ he said.

Mr Miliband said he had ‘huge sympathy’ for those whose lives were disrupted by the strike. But he said he was ‘not going to condemn the dinner ladies, nurses, teachers who have made the decision to go on strike because they feel they have been put in an impossible position by a government that has refused to negotiate properly’.
