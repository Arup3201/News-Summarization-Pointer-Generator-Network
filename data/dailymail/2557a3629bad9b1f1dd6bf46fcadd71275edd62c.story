A fugitive charged with abducting and sexually assaulting a 10-year-old Los Angeles girl was returned to the U.S. today after authorities arrested him in a Mexican village where he'd checked himself into a rehabilitation facility under a fake name.

Tobias Summers, 30, was being brought to Los Angeles to face 37 felony charges, including numerous sexual assault counts, FBI Special Agent in Charge Tim Delaney said.

Summers has been on the run for nearly a month. Police Chief Charlie Beck credited a $25,000 FBI reward that was highly publicized south of the border for a phone tip late on Tuesday that led to Summers' arrest on Wednesday morning.

'Anybody in this city who thinks they can commit that kind of crime and remain free after doing so ... we'll hunt you, we'll find you, you cannot hide,' Beck said.

Mexican authorities acted on the tip received by the FBI and tracked Summers to a drug and alcohol treatment facility in a tiny village on the coast between Tijuana and Ensenada, according to Alfredo Arenas, international liaison for the Baja California state police.

Summers checked into the facility under a false name, but police identified him from a Superman logo tattooed on his chest, Arenas said. He was arrested without struggle.

'He was pretty scared,' Arenas said. 'We had him in custody very fast.'

The victim's parents discovered she was missing from her bedroom in her Northridge home in the early morning hours of March 27. She was found about 12 hours later wandering near a Starbucks several miles away.

Authorities soon arrested Daniel Martinez, 29, as a suspected accomplice and later revealed that Summers had been spotted in a video recording as he crossed the border into Mexico at Tecate, east of San Diego.

Authorities believe Summers broke into the girl's home planning to burglarize it but instead abducted her at knifepoint. They believe Martinez was waiting outside in a car the two used to flee with the girl.

Martinez soon abandoned the car and vanished, police have said, while Summers took the girl to a vacant home where he assaulted her.

FBI Special Agent Scott Garriola wrote in an affidavit that the girl was taken to several locations and raped.

While he was a fugitive, Summers was charged by Los Angeles County prosecutors with kidnapping, burglary and nearly three dozen counts of sexual assault.

Summers was described as a transient with a criminal record including convictions for burglary and grand theft. Detectives identified him as a suspect based on evidence at a crime scene, the victim's descriptions and others.

Four days after the abduction, LAPD detectives were told that Summers may be in the San Diego area. In an interview with a friend of Summers, detectives learned he had been thinking of going to Tijuana, Mexico.

Video showed Summers crossing the border into Tecate, Mexico, three days after the abduction.

'This entry into Mexico occurred within several hours of Summers being identified in the media as the person responsible for the kidnapping,' a federal complaint stated.

On Wednesday, the FBI website showed pictures of Summers and his tattoos with the word 'captured' across the bottom of each photo.

Mexican authorities had distributed 'wanted' posters with Summers' picture and put police in the cities of Tecate, Ensenada and Rosarito Beach on alert.

Summers has a criminal record dating to 2002 that includes arrests for robbery, battery and grand theft auto.

Court records show Martinez has been convicted of burglary and grand theft. He has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping and burglary.

Summers was charged early this month with kidnapping, burglary and nearly three dozen counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he faces multiple life terms in prison.

His alleged accomplice, Martinez, was also charged in the kidnapping having been arrested almost a month ago.

According to police, Summers broke into victim's house in the middle of the night on March 27 while Martinez waited in a getaway car. Summers emerged from the home with the girl and they both got in the car.

Martinez drove a short distance and then abandoned the vehicle and disappeared. Summers took the girl to a vacant home nearby where he held her captive, police said.

At some point, according to a criminal complaint, Summers sexually assaulted her and forced her to pose for nude photos. The girl turned up about 12 hours later after the harrowing ordeal, disoriented and disheveled.

Police Cmdr. Andrew Smith said it was unclear why Summers abducted the girl but investigators don't believe he had targeted her when he initially went to the home.

Martinez was charged with one count each of kidnapping and burglary. He faces a maximum 12-year prison term if found guilty.

The girl was snatched from her bedroom and was found wandering near a Starbucks about six miles away.

She was barefoot, had bruises and scratches, and wasn't wearing the same clothes she had on when she vanished.

Both men have had problems with law enforcement in the past.

Summers has a criminal record dating back to 2002 that includes arrests for robbery, battery and grand theft auto. Court records show Martinez has been convicted of burglary and grand theft.

Police have received more than 130 tips in recent days regarding Summers, who fled to Mexico hours after he was identified as a suspect.
