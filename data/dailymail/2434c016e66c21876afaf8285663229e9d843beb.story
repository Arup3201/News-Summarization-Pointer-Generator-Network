With families across the country wanting a majestic fir to display in their homes this holiday season, it's the busiest time of the year for Christmas tree farms. 

And it appears the most efficient way to collect the trees is by using a really fast chopper.

It would probably take several burly men hours to drag the trees from where they are felled to a nearby pick-up truck.

But at the Noble Mountain Tree Farm in Salem, Oregon, a handy helicopter and its skilled pilot hoist no less than four trees into a truck in this 90-second clip.

At the Noble Mountain Tree Farm in Salem, Oregon, a time-saving trick means more Christmas trees can be transported quicker

In just 90 seconds, the skilled helicopter pilot hoists a total of four trees into a nearby pick-up truck

The helicopter picks up the trees on a tether and carries them through the air, before dropping them carefully into the truck. 

And despite the foggy sky, the pilot appears to have no trouble navigating at all and instead shows off his skill by completing the task as quickly as possible.

In a clear indication of the pilot's speed, three trucks can be seen lined up along the road in the video, waiting to be filled.

Over the course of the clip, the first is loaded with trucks and ready to go and it will no doubt take no time at all to pack the other two.
