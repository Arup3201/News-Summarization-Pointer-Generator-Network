A pregnant young mother and her unborn child were killed after a 'duel' between two drivers ended in a devastating car crash.

Sales assistant Kimberley See, 21, was five months pregnant with her second child when the crash occurred as she was being driven home from a funfair by Ryan Williams, the boyfriend of one of her friends.

The fateful 'duel' unfolded as Williams, 23, tried to block another driver, 21-year-old Christopher Cottingham, from overtaking him on a long stretch of country road, Lincoln Crown Court heard.

'Competitive driving': When Ryan Williams, left, blocked Christopher Cottingham, right, from overtaking his car, Cottingham tried to undertake him instead of keeping his distance, a court heard

Williams repeatedly touched his brakes and then moved his Citroen Saxo onto the wrong side of the road to block Cottingham from passing him, the court heard.

Then, when Cottingham tried to undertake him, Williams returned to his own side of the carriageway.

The two cars collided and Williams’ vehicle left the road and crashed into a tree.

Ms See, who was sitting in the back of the car, suffered fatal injuries.

Prosecutor Mark Van der Zwart said: 'Cottingham saw the way that Williams was driving. What he should have done was slow down or stop and create a gap so there wasn’t any danger.

'Instead of keeping his distance and not engaging in what appears to have been something of a duel he got too close.

'The two cars collided. It was enough to cause both drivers to lose control and both left the road. Kimberley See was trapped and died inside the car.

'There was no reason for this to have occurred but for the driving by the people involved,' the barrister said.

Sentencing: Lincoln Crown Court was told Ms See's son Lucas, three, is now being raised by his grandparents

The court was told that Kimberley See’s three-year-old son, Lucas, is now being brought up by his grandparents.Mr Van der Zwart added: 'When Kimberley died she was 20 weeks pregnant.'

Williams, 23, of Sussex Avenue, Boston, was convicted by a jury of causing death by careless driving as a result of the crash on the B1192 in Lincolnshire, on 14 October 2011.

Cottingham ,21, of New York Road, Coningsby, Lincolnshire, admitted the same charge.

Both drivers were seriously injured in the crash.

Williams was jailed for a year and Cottingham jailed for 46 weeks. Both have been banned from driving for three years.

No sentence can adequately reflect the loss of Kimberley’s life. The lives of her family have been turned upside down.

'The consequences were devastating. You were equally the cause of her death.

'This can properly be described as competitive driving. It was a bad case of careless driving.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
