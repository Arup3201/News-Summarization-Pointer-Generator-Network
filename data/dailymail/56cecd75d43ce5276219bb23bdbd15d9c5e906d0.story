 

Football fans are rallying behind a football player who was resigned to his team after being cut so he could keep his health insurance and pay for his four-year-old daughter's cancer treatments.

Defensive tackle Devon Still, 25, was cut from the roster of the Cincinnati Bengals two weeks ago, but the team did bring him on to the practice squad instead, meaning he would still get paid and receive his health insurance. 

And now, fans are showing their support in a very big way, by making his football jersey the fastest-selling in team history.

The Bengals have said all proceeds from the sale of Still's jersey will go toward pediatric cancer research, according to Fox 29.

It's not just fans either, as even competing teams are showing their support by snapping up some of their rival's shirts, with the Bengals thanking the New Orleans Saints for buying 100 jerseys earlier this week.

The support from the Bengals - which included allowing Still to miss last Sunday's game in Baltimore - comes after he was out of six games last season for injuries to his elbow and back.

Speaking with Bengals.com, he explained: 'They said if I keep working on my physical... and mentally prepared myself to focus on football then they can move me back up to the roster so I am not all the way out of the loop...

Just them sticking by me through this whole time, they understand exactly what I am going through. It is a blessing I am on this organization.'   

The move means that he will receive a weekly salary of $6,300, will have to travel less, and get to spend more time with Leah, who is being treated in Philadelphia.

Ever since Leah's diagnosis, Still has shared images on Instagram showing her dancing in the hospital and grinning as she headed back for her fourth round of chemotherapy a few weeks ago.

The proud father, who is engaged, has also shaved his head in support of his daughter, who has lost her hair to her treatment. 

Still's daughter has stage IV pediatric cancer.
