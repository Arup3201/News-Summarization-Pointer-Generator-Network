Fresh from being crowned World Cup champions, Australia have announced their 17-man squad to face England in the Ashes this summer.

Alastair Cook and Co face a daunting prospect in trying to reclaim the urn they surrendered with such a whimper last year, especially with pace men Mitchell Starc and last year's danger man Mitchell Johnson in their prospective bowling line-up.

Here, Sportsmail's cricket expert Lawrence Booth assesses the intimidating Australian squad man-by-man. 

Michael Clarke (capt)

Age 33

Caps 108

Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final. But his dodgy back could be an issue in a five-Test series. Should out-captain Alastair Cook once more.

David Warner

Age 28

Caps 36

Verdict Could win a Test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions. Moeen Ali’s off-breaks will be crucial in pinning him down. Likes to say a word or two.

Shane Watson

Age 33

Caps 56

Verdict Has a decent record in Ashes cricket, but has never reached the stage where he frightens England. But his medium-pace balances Australia’s team in a way Cook can only envy.

Shaun Marsh

Age 31

Caps 12

Verdict A gritty left-hander, and son of former Test opener Geoff. Began Test career with 141 in Sri Lanka in 2011, but success has been sporadic since then. CV includes six ducks.

Mitchell Johnson

Age 33

Caps 64

Verdict If England haven’t got over the trauma of the 2013-14 series, when Johnson took 37 wickets at 13 apiece, the Ashes will stay with Australia.

Josh Hazlewood

Age 24

Caps 3

Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well.

James Faulkner

Age 24

Caps 1

Verdict Played his only Test to date at The Oval in 2013, where he got up England’s noses by accusing them of boring batting. A left-arm seam-bowling all-rounder, he can give the ball an almighty whack.

James Pattinson

Age 24

Caps 13

Verdict Injuries have limited him since he burst on to the scene in 2011-12, but the talent is undeniable: tall, aggressive and fast, he should trouble England more than his brother, Darren, when playing for England in a single Test against South Africa in 2008.

Peter Siddle

Age 30

Caps 56

Verdict The banana-loving seamer is a veteran of two Ashes tours, and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him. Kevin Pietersen, for one, found him almost impossible to score off in 2013-14. 

Brad Haddin (wkt)

Age 37

Caps 63

Verdict Australia’s second-most important cog in their 5-0 Ashes wheel in 2013-14, after Mitchell Johnson. His sledging from behind the stumps is considered the heartbeat of the team.

Chris Rogers

Age 37

Caps 20

Verdict This will be his last hurrah in a late-blooming Test career. Calm, compact and the perfect foil for the exuberance of his opening partner Warner.

Steve Smith (vice captain)

Age 25

Caps 26

Verdict One of world cricket’s rising stars, he scored four tons in Australia’s recent home series against India. Will captain the side full-time after Clarke retires, and can burgle the odd wicket with his leg-spin.

Nathan Lyon 

Age 27

Caps 39

Verdict A steady off-spinner who troubled England’s right-handers  during whitewash. But, really, they should have nothing to fear.

Mitchell Starc

Age 25

Caps 15

Verdict Another left-arm seamer, and Man of the Tournament at the World Cup. His yorkers are as dangerous in Tests as they are in ODIs, and  accuracy and pace have improved.

Ryan Harris

Age 35

Caps 27

Verdict If he can drag his injury-laden body through one final series, Australia will be thrilled. He was an unsung star during their 3-0 defeat here two years ago, and produced the ball of the series to bowl Cook in Perth.

Josh Hazlewood

Age 24

Caps 3

Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well. 

Fawad Ahmed

Age 33

Caps 20

Verdict The Pakistan-born leg-spinner has played only three one-day internationals and two Twenty20 games for Australia, so would represent a risk. But Australian leggies have done well in England before…

Michael Clarke (capt)

Age 33

Caps 108

Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final. But his dodgy back could be an issue in a five-Test series. Should out-captain Alastair Cook once more.

David Warner

Age 28

Caps 36

Verdict Could win a Test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions. Moeen Ali’s off-breaks will be crucial in pinning him down. Likes to say a word or two.

Shane Watson

Age 33

Caps 56

Verdict Has a decent record in Ashes cricket, but has never reached the stage where he frightens England. But his medium-pace balances Australia’s team in a way Cook can only envy.

Shaun Marsh

Age 31

Caps 12

Verdict A gritty left-hander, and son of former Test opener Geoff. Began Test career with 141 in Sri Lanka in 2011, but success has been sporadic since then. CV includes six ducks.

Mitchell Johnson

Age 33

Caps 64

Verdict: If England haven’t got over the trauma of the 2013-14 series, when Johnson took 37 wickets at 13 apiece, the Ashes will stay with Australia.

Peter Siddle

Age 30

Caps 56

Verdict The banana-loving seamer is a veteran of two Ashes tours, and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him. Kevin Pietersen, for one, found him almost impossible to score off in 2013-14. 

Mitchell Marsh

Age 23

Caps 4

Verdict A rangy all-rounder and younger brother of Shaun, Marsh stunned England during the World Cup with figures of 5 for 33 at Melbourne – despite having taken only six ODI wickets until then. His batting is the stronger suit.

Peter Nevill

Age 29

Caps 0

Verdict Peter who? Nevill has been chosen as the reserve wicketkeeper behind his New South Wales team-mate Haddin, although he has also played as a specialist batsman for his state team. Unlikely to get a game unless Haddin breaks a finger.

Adam Voges

Age 35

Caps 0

Verdict An outsider for a Test debut, but he knows English conditions well – Voges has spent time with Hampshire, Middlesex and Nottinghamshire – and bowls left-arm spin to complement his middle-order hitting.
