Ryan Shawcross is ready to make his return from a six week injury lay-off in time to face his old manager Tony Pulis.

The Stoke captain has been out since aggravating a back injury during the 3-1 win over Queens Park Rangers in January but could start against West Bromwich Albion.

Shawcross has come through his first full week of training since suffering the problem and is a welcome boost for boss Mark Hughes as he targets a fourth straight Premier League victory.

Speaking on Friday morning Hughes said: 'Ryan has joined in with the rest of the group for the best part of the week and he has come through it okay.

'Obviously there is still another session in front of us, and as long as he suffers no affects from that then he will certainly be in my thoughts. 

'We have a doubt over Philipp Wollscheid anyway so having Ryan available could help us in that regard. We lost him early on in the last game against Everton and Geoff Cameron came on and performed superbly well. 

'Whether Ryan or Philipp is available I still have good options available to me, so I aren’t too worried about it.’
