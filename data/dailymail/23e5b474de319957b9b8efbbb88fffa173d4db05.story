A hospital patient subjected an 80-year-old woman to a degrading sexual assault for an hour as she waited for treatment.

Edward Deevy, 56, crept into the elderly woman's cubicle and attacked her at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.

He appeared before Liverpool Crown Court today via videolink from HMP Liverpool and spoke only to confirm his name and admit sex assault.

Attack: The 80-year-old woman was attacked by Edward Deevy in a cubicle at Royal Liverpool University Hospital

The court was told that Deevy, of Aigburth, Liverpool, attacked the woman on April 2.

The pensioner is believed to have been in an area screened off from the accident and emergency department when she was attacked.

She is understood to have been left traumatised and is being supported by family members.

Hearing: Deevy admitted sex assault via videolink

Anya Horwood, prosecuting, said: 'This is a most unusual and distressing case. The prosecution accept the forensic evidence and the plea.'

The court heard Deevy was caught on CCTV entering the area where his victim was lying in a hospital bed and drawing the curtains before he left 'some 59 minutes later'.

Ms Horwood said staff at the city centre hospital noticed Deevy's suspicious 'behaviour' during a 'routine check' of the patients.

Police were called and Deevy, who was convicted of indecent assault on a nine year-old girl in 1976, was arrested and later charged under the Sexual Offences Act.

Judge Andrew Hatton remanded the defendant in custody to appear at a pre-sentence hearing at Liverpool Crown Court on May 17.

Chief executive of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals Trust Aidan Kehoe said following the incident: 'We are working closely with the patient's family to keep them fully informed and are working with the police to provide them with all the information they require.'
