An SUV driver who was accused of deliberately running down a Muslim teenager in a 'hate crime' has been charged with first-degree murder.

Ahmed H. Aden, 34, of Kansas City, was charged in Jackson County in the crash that killed Abdisamad Sheikh-Hussein, 15, outside a Somali community center.

The convenience store manager was seen driving the sport utility vehicle toward the teen as the boy got into a car Thursday evening.

A witness saw Hussein 'fly through the air' as the SUV hit him then ran over him.

His legs were nearly severed, and he later died in hospital from his wounds.

According to the witness, Aden crashed the SUV then got out of the vehicle with a knife.

Occupants of the car told officers they followed him and pointed him out to police. 

One witness said the suspect swung what appeared to be a baseball bat at people, and another witness reported that Aden pulled out a handgun and said to 'Stay there' as he walked away.

However, Aden initially told authorities that he had lost control of his vehicle and struck the teen because he thought he looked like a man who'd threatened him several days earlier.

FBI spokeswoman Bridget Patton said: 'Federal agents are assisting in the investigation and have opened this matter as a federal civil rights investigation as a potential hate crimes violation.' 

Patton said she could not release any information on why the case could be considered a hate crime, but Muslim leaders had called for such an investigation early Friday.

In the weeks before the crash, worshipers said they saw a black SUV painted with threatening messages at the center and cruising around a nearby shopping area. 

Mohamed Ahmed, 13, of Kansas City said: 'One of the messages was 'Islam Is Worse Than Ebola.'

'I would have thought the police would have taken care of it, but they didn't,' he said.

But there was no mention of those incidents in court records and police didn't immediately comment on whether they're connected to the teen's death.

Prayer: Men gather to pray the day after 15-year-old Abdisamad Sheikh-Hussein was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver in front of the Somali Center of Kansas City, Mo., Friday, Dec. 5, 2014

Mohamed Farah, 50, a  friend of the boy's family, said he called police more than once in October about a suspicious man who was coming around the center.

'I feel like I lost a part of my body,' he said after the teen's death.

Bakar Abdalla, 31, of Kansas City, said the boy's father was a teacher at the center. 

He said the man who had been frequenting the area with hateful messages was like a bullet in a gun waiting to be triggered.

Khadra Dirir, the victim's aunt, said her nephew regularly studied the Quran and had delivered a group prayer the night he died.

'If you asked him a verse, he could tell the chapter,' she said. 'I feel like I woke up in a bad dream.'
