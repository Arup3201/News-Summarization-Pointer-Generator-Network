The Copa Libertadores provided one of the most eventful matches in recent memory when Montevideo Wanderers welcomed Venezuelan side Zamora to Uruguay.

Five goals, five red cards and a wonder strike followed by an impressive bowling-ball strike celebration.

Montevideo came out 3-2 winners after scoring two late goals but the game is likely to be remembered for Arles Flores' strike and funny celebration for Zamora.

The midfielder took aim when the scores were poised at 1-1 and blasted home from 35 yards past the helpless keeper.

Zamora had gone down to 10 men after just 20 minutes when Angel Faria received a straight red before Jhon Murillo gave them the lead with a fine individual effort.

Wanderers leveled things up just 16 minutes later but not by scoring - they had Adrian Colombino sent off to make it 10 men apiece.

They did however equalise in stoppage time in the first half when Gaston Rodriguez fired home from inside the box.

Flores then produced the moment of the match after half-time when he picked up the ball deep in the opposition half, burst forward and arrowed a strike straight into the top corner. 

His celebration wasn't bad either as him and his team-mates performed the 'bowling-ball strike' to celebrate his goal.

The Venezuelan side then came within inches of extending their advantage when Murillo chipped the goalkeeper - only for it to rebound back off the bar. 

That miss came back to haunt them as Montevideo made it 2-2 from the penalty spot through Nicolas Albarracín.

The offender Luis Ovalle also received his marching orders for hauling down Albarracín and being shown his second yellow.

The Uruguayans then took the lead for the first time on 82 minutes when substitute Leandro Reymundez flicked in a neat header.

Murillo and Montevideo's Juan Mascia were then sent off three minutes into injury-time to make it 9-8 in terms of players left on the pitch and bring this mental game to an explosive end.
