Attack: One-time TV dad of the year Keith Preddie could face jail after he admitted attacking his wife

A former television dad of the year is facing jail after he admitted attacking his wife in a row over Christmas presents.

Michael Jackson impersonator and father of three Keith Preddie, 44, threw a clothes horse and a plastic step at his wife Emma before pinning her to a sofa at their home in Croydon last December.

Preddie, who was awarded the title of Britain's Best Dad by GMTV in 2010, gave a long pause before breaking down in tears as he admitted assault by beating at Croydon Magistrates' Court today.

Chairman of the Bench Jackie Hamblin warned Preddie he could face a spell behind bars as she adjourned the hearing for sentence next month.

The performer, who wore a black suit with a white shirt and a black tie, appeared tearful throughout the hearing and was supported in court by around 15 well-wishers.

Preddie was Britain's original Michael Jackson impersonator, first taking on the role of the King of Pop in 1986 and going on to perform his routine on stage and screen.

He has also worked for the Family Centre in New Addington, which offers support services for local families, for the past decade.

It was his work to set up an It's Time For Dad's support group at the centre that saw him crowned Britain's Best Dad by GMTV three years ago.

The court heard details of Preddie's assault on his wife at the family home in Croydon, footage of which was captured on a CCTV camera at the house.

Prosecutor Louise Thomas told the court how a row flared on the morning of December 18 last year after Preddie marched in to the back room of the family home where his wife was wrapping Christmas presents.

'Mr Preddie entered the room and asked her if there were any presents left over that he could give his mother,' she said.

'Mrs Preddie replied she had already given his mother a present.

'At that point Mr Preddie became angry, he shouted that he had been to a lot of shops to get a present for his mother and he got very stressed during the day looking for one.'

Ms Thomas told magistrates how Mrs Preddie warned her husband she would only speak to him if he calmed down. But his anger only worsened.

'Suddenly he grabbed a washing frame which had clothing on it and he threw it at her. It landed about a foot away from her,' she said.

'At that point she told him he had better calm down and grow up so he left the room.

'After a short time he re-entered the room and started shouting again. He then threw a plastic step at Mrs Preddie hitting her on her left arm,' the prosecutor said.

The court was told how Mrs Preddie told her husband to get out of the room.

Ms Thomas said: 'At that point she walked straight up to him and then she suddenly found herself pinned down by both arms.

'Each of the defendant's hands holding each arm. She was pinned down lying against the sofa. She shouted "Get off me, leave me alone".

'He then let go and she left the room. The argument caused such a commotion that it woke up their daughter,' she said.

Notoriety: Preddie appeared on an episode of Come Dine With Me and was named Britain's Best Dad by GMTV in 2010

Ms Thomas told how Mrs Preddie contacted police the following day, having already spoken to a domestic violence shelter.

She added: 'On the morning of December 20 she told Mr Preddie that she had called the police and he said he knew what he had done was wrong and apologised.'

After the hearing Ms Thomas explained that CCTV footage of the assault obtained by police had come 
from a camera inside the house. No explanation was given as to why there
was a camera present.

She also said pictures taken by Ms Preddie showed bruising to her left arm.

Adjourning the hearing for sentence on April 11, Ms Hamblin said: 'The report that we will request is an all options report. That could include custody.

'We note that this offence was committed in a domestic setting and had an effect on your daughter, who was in the house.

'We found greater harm because of the sustained nature of the attack.'

Preddie has appeared on an episode of the Channel 4 reality show Come Dine With Me, which saw him annoying his fellow contestants by repeatedly parroting Jacko's 'Shamone' catchphrase.

He later released a pop single named Shamone, which entered the music charts in Germany.

Preddie was bailed to return to the court on April 11 for sentence, when the court will also hear an application for costs and a restraining order.

He was ordered not to contact his ex-wife and will only be allowed back to his old family home while accompanied by police to collect his belongings.Â
