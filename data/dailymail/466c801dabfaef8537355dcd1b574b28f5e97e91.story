The toddler left critically injured 
after a SWAT team broke into the home where he were staying and threw a 
flash bang grenade into the sleeping child's crib has finally been 
allowed to leave hospital.

Bounkham
 Phonesavanh, who is 19 months old, was seriously injured when the 
grenade went off in his playpen during an early morning drugs raid on 
May 28.

Baby Bou Bou 
finally left hospital on Tuesday and his parents recorded video footage 
of the smiling and laughing little boy walking out of the hospital on 
his own. He starts to run towards his mom but then spies a 
SpongeBob-branded bin and runs towards that instead.

Baby Bou Bou finally left hospital on Tuesday 
and his parents recorded video footage of the smiling and laughing 
little boy walking out of the hospital on his own

The little boy looks 
dramatically better than in the shocking picture released after the 
horrific incident which caused a brain injury, 
collapsed a lung and disfigured his face.

A lawyer for the family told The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution that Bou Bou has a long road to recovery ahead of 
him.

'He had to re-learn how to walk so to see him walk out of the hospital this morning was a miracle,' said Mawuli Davis.

Surgeons
 repaired the boy’s lung so he no longer needs a ventilator and patched 
and re-attached his nose that had been detached by the explosion as well
 as repaired injuries to his lips and mouth.

'His face still has significant scarring, and there will be some need in the future for more plastic surgery' said Davis.

In the wake of the incident, Bou Bou's mom Alecia Phonesavanh has spoken out about abuse of power by police officers.

The incident had occurred while she was staying with her husband, their three daughters and their baby son in the living room of her sister-in-law's home just outside of Atlanta after their Wisconsin home burnt down.

As the family slept, a SWAT team descended on the home, breaking down the door and throwing a grenade inside, which landed in the boy's crib.

'Flashbang grenades were created for 
soldiers to use during battle. When they explode, the noise is so loud 
and the flash is so bright that anyone close by is temporarily blinded 
and deafened,' wrote Alecia Phonesavanh on Salon.com.

Police did not allow Phonesavanh to see her son, who was carried from the home by an officer and taken to hospital.

All the Phonesavanhs could see of their son was a pool of blood on the pavement.

The child was seriously injured and placed in a medically induced coma in Grady Memorial Hospital's burn unit.  

'He's
 in the burn unit. We go up to see him and his whole face is ripped 
open. He has a big cut on his chest,' Phonesavanh said. 'He's only 19 
months old. He didn't do anything.'

 injuries are too graphic to share though one shows burns all over his 
face.

Cornelia Police Chief Rick Darby confirmed the raid took place at the home just before 3 a.m.

He said a mulch-jurisdictional drug unit issued a warrant and organized the SWAT operation.

Baby Bou Bou, as he is known by his 
family, was only taken out of his induced coma last week. He still 
has a huge open wound on his chest that exposes his ribs, which 
Phonesavanh can't bring herself to look at.

'He
 has lost his left nipple from the explosion. He still has a pretty big 
hole in his chest. I personally have not looked at it. I don't think I 
could handle it. I would probably lose my mind as a mother,' she said.

Doctors
 are unable to tell the family whether Bou Bou has suffered any lasting 
brain damage.

Phonesavanh says the SWAT team was 
looking for her husband's nephew, who doesn't live in the home. They 
searched for drugs in the home and did not find any.

The family has a webpage where people can donate to Bou Bou's rehabilitation and support the family's efforts to publicize the abuse of power by police officers that is happening all over the country.

'This is happening every day to people [who are] being relentlessly and unnecessarily militarized by police who think just because they're supposed to be upholding the law, they are above the law themselves,' said Phonesavanh.

'It’s time to remind the cops that they should be serving and protecting our neighborhoods, not waging war on the people in them.'
