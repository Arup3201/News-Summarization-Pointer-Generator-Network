Wanted fugitive Jose Manuel Garcia Guevara was brought back to Louisiana on Wednesday after he allegedly murdered a woman in front of her son in 2008

A fugitive on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List for allegedly raping and fatally stabbing a woman in front of her four-year-old son has been extradited back to the U.S. after surrendering in Mexico last year.

Jose Manuel Garcia Guevara, 26, was brought back to Lake Charles, Louisiana on Wednesday, where the heinous crime took place.

The FBI reported on its website that Guevara, a Mexican national, handed himself in to authorities after six years on the run.

'This fugitive investigation and extradition could not have been possible without the tremendous cooperation and collaboration of federal, state, local, and international law enforcement partners,' stated Michael J. Anderson, Special Agent in Charge, FBI New Orleans.

Guevara is accused of breaking into 26-year-old Wanda Barton's mobile home in Lake Charles on February 19, 2008.

Once inside the home, he allegedly raped her before stabbing her to death in the presence of her then four-year-old stepson.

Guevara was an illegal alien working local construction and lived with four roommates next door to the Bartons.

State authorities in 2008 charged Guevara with second-degree murder, aggravated rape and aggravated burglary. A federal warrant was issued for his arrest in 2009.

Guevara, placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list last year, was the 499th name to be added to the list, which initially started in 1950, according to the FBI website.

Guevara was accompanied by FBI agents and arrived to the U.S. on Wednesday. He was brought to local authorities in the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff’s Office and awaits arraignment on state charges.

At the time of his wife's murder, Kevin Barton told KPLC: 'She was the 
best kind of person. Always smiling, always happy, 
always willing to do any new adventure.

'She had a lot of firsts with me.
 I gave her the best life I could give her.'

At the time of the 
murder, authorities believed he had purchased a bus ticket to Dallas in an effort to cross the Mexican border. 

Guevara was not charged with first-degree murder due to an extradition treaty which exists between Mexico and the U.S., according to the Sulphur Daily News.

The agreement means citizens cannot face capital punishment or first-degree murder charges when they are returned to the U.S.
