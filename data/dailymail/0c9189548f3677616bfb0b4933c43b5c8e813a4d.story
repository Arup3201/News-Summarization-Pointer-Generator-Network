Criminals used a giant catapult to fire contraband over a prison wall to inmates inside.

The gang attached a huge elastic sling to an eight foot tall metal frame with the intention of shooting packages of drugs and mobile phones into the jail.

But they were caught by prison officers who spotted them acting suspiciously in a wood near the perimeter fence.

The catapult alert was sounded at an unnamed prison in the Midlands, but the gang was caught

When officers went to investigate, the men fled, leaving the giant catapult behind.

One parcel had made it over the fence but was seized inside the jail. Three others, containing drugs, mobile phones and other banned goods were found near the catapult.

Prison security officers at other jails have now been warned that criminals may use similar tactics elsewhere.

The catapult alert was sounded at an unnamed prison in the Midlands.

Prison officers believe the criminals 
first used potatoes to test fire the weapon. They adjusted the 
trajectory and distance to try to land in a target area inside the jail.

The gang intended to throw packages of drugs and mobile phones to their inmates using an 8ft metal frame with an elastic sling attached (here's the Nokia Lumia 925) - and even tried hurling potatoes over the walls to test their weapon

One man held the catapult, while the other pulled the huge elastic band back. It was identified as a ‘Wild Sling’ catapult designed for use with water balloons and sold online.

The third man acted as a spotter and was on the phone to the intended recipients inside the jail.

They would pass on directions to adjust the strength and angle of the weapon depending on the results of the test firings.

A prison source said: ‘Apparently, the three suspects started their operation by firing potatoes into the prison, in order to calculate trajectory and distance.

‘One suspect held the base of the catapult and one was firing the objects. A third suspect was directing operations using a mobile which he used to liaise with a prisoner inside the jail.’

The source added: ‘The discovery by the alert officers at the jail prevented a significant supply chain of drugs, mobile phones and other contraband from criminals outside to the prison.’

Police have been called in and are investigating the incident.

Insiders said the find suggested an organised supply network at work with ‘resources, planning and determination’

Officials said they had disrupted a ‘significant contraband supply chain from the criminal community to the prison’.

Prison staff have struggled to disrupt the supply of drugs into Britain’s prisons. Often packages are simply tossed over the wall into an area frequented by inmates.

Lags use illicit mobile phones to arrange the drop so they are there at the right time.

Prison chiefs have tried to block mobile phone signals around jails but have struggled to get the technology to work.

Inmates have been known to hide drugs and even mobile phones inside their body to try and get them in to jail.

Several prisons are fitted with x-ray chairs to spot hidden goods.

In other cases, corrupt prison officers are used to smuggle the goods inside.

It is estimated the trade in drugs inside prisons could be worth £100million a year. Some inmates have complained it is easier to get drugs in jail than outside, and said they did not develop a habit until they were locked up.

Ministers have launched ‘drug free wings’ in an effort to crack down on supply and allow inmates to get clean.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘This demonstrates the significant lengths criminals will go to in order to smuggle contraband into our prisons, and demonstrates the excellent work carried out by vigilant staff to foil this attempt.

‘This is indicative of the way in which we are succeeding in tackling the problem of illicit items being smuggled into prisons.’

Anyone caught trying to get drugs or mobile phones into prisons may find themselves behind bars if convicted.’
