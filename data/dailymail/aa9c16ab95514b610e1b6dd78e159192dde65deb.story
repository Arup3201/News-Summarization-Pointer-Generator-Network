Clutching a bundle of papers, Professor Vicky Pryce could be on her way to her next economics lecture.

Casually dressed, wearing little or no make-up, she appears business-like but relaxed.

In fact, she’s on her way to the library at her home for the next few weeks, East Sutton Park prison.

New friends: Vicky Pryce, who was convicted of perverting the course of justice alongside her ex-husband, former cabinet minster Chris Huhne, can be seen for the first time settling into life at East Sutton Park open jail

Big improvement: The economist spent four days enduring the harsh regime at Holloway Prison before being moved to the countryside open jail

These are the first pictures of the disgraced former academic and top civil servant amid the prison’s easy-going regime.

She carries the same black notebook 
that she clutched inside the prison van after her court appearance. In 
front of her and two other inmates is a prison guard.

Onlookers said Pryce – who was 
transferred from Holloway Prison in North London last Friday – appeared 
to be in ‘good spirits’ as she ambled through the grounds of the prison 
near Maidstone, Kent.

Hard time: Vicky Pryce was moved to the open jail East Sutton Park where she is free to wander the grounds, pictured, until 11pm after spending only four days behind bars at Holloway Prison in North London

New home: East Sutton Park open prison near Maidstone in Kent, an an 15th century Elizabethan manor

She has replaced her usual skirt suit
and black heels with a grey polo-neck sweater, black cardigan and dark 
trousers. But at least they were not the prison clothes she wore after 
first arriving in Holloway.

She was jailed for eight months for 
perverting the course of justice ten days ago after swapping penalty 
points with her ex-husband Chris Huhne.

She spent four nights at Holloway, Europe’s largest women’s jail, before being moved.

Making herself at home: Vicky Pryce can be seen wearing a pair of black trousers and a smart black coat next to a fellow inmate in a light blue fleece and beige trousers

Jailed: Vicky Pryce, the ex-wife of former energy secretary Chris Huhne, pictured inside the window of a prison van as she was taken to Holloway Prison where she was moved after only four days

Guilty: Pryce and former Cabinet minister Huhne were both sentenced to eight months for perverting the course of justice after she ‘accepted’ his speeding points ten years ago

The multimillionaire mother-of-five  
is expected to serve the remainder  of her sentence in the more relaxed 
surroundings of the listed 15th-century building.

It is described on the Ministry of 
Justice website as a ‘pleasant mansion house overlooking the Weald of 
Kent’. During her time there, Pryce will be expected to work on the 
prison farm performing duties such as weeding, digging and mucking out 
pigs.

There are many classes available at 
East Sutton Park, including art, computer studies, cookery and creative 
writing. The prison holds around 100 adult and young offender women in 
32 dormitory-style bedrooms in the main house.

Huhne remains in Wandsworth  Prison 
but is expected to be transferred to another open prison, possibly  Ford
near Arundel in West Sussex, within a week.

Settling: Pryce was moved to East Sutton Park open prison near Maidstone, described as a 'pleasant mansion house', where a friend said she was 'settling in'

First officials must complete a risk assessment to ensure he poses no danger to others or may try to escape.

A fellow prisoner at Wandsworth, the 
public school fraudster Edward Davenport, told a visitor that many 
inmates sympathised with Huhne over his treatment at the hands of his 
wife.

They have been helping him get hold of some little luxuries including  toiletries and Twix bars from the prison canteen.

The former environment secretary’s 
lawyers will return to court this afternoon to dispute the £120,000 
legal bill that he was handed last week.

Prosecutors and police have applied for the money to pay for their lengthy and complex investigation.

But Huhne has already signalled he 
does not agree he is responsible for all of the costs, despite hiring a 
£20,000-a-day barrister to defend himself.

Pryce and Huhne are likely to be 
released under a home curfew scheme for non-violent prisoners after 
serving just a quarter of their sentences.
