By the end the Leicester players were all smiles, cavorting in a corner celebrating a famous FA Cup victory in front of their fans. Jeff Schlupp, who might have been at the African Nations’ Cup had the Ghanaian FA pushed harder for his inclusion, was at the centre of a scrum of ecstatic players, as two goals in the last seven minutes plucked an unlikely victory from a day which had seem likely to end in bitter recriminations.

And amidst all the joy, even Andrej Kramaric, by then on the bench, might have found a moment to smile. The Croatian striker has only been in England for a fortnight and his first impressions of the country can’t be altogether positive.

It was the Croatian striker’s first start, having played 25 minutes last weekend in the defeat to Stoke. At Tottenham he missed a simple chance on ten minutes from close range in an otherwise energetic and good performance but that wasn’t the worst of it.

His bewilderment with the mores of our game must have reached a peak on 42 minutes when he sprinted on to a through ball from Danny Drinkwater.

For all the late drama, what happened next occupied centre stage of the afternoon’s entertainment. Goalkeeper Michel Vorm came charging out, missed the ball and took the man in the penalty area. A red card and a penalty seemed inevitable. Instead, referee Robert Madley reached with a flourish for a yellow card for diving and pointed in the opposite direction for a Tottenham free kick.

Kramaric looked flabbergasted. Nigel Pearson on the bench looked so surprised that he bypassed anger for utter incredulity. Even Vorm looked a little apologetic, placing an arm around Kramaric.

‘He’s a bit bemused by it,’ said Pearson. ‘He didn’t quite understand. But we have to address this situation at some point. It’s an honest mistake. It’s not done on purpose but I’m a big believer in the fact we need to introduce more technology to aid the officials. 

'We can have replays and you in th press have monitors and can see incidents very quickly after they occur so there shouldn’t be an issue with having another official who can see replays.

‘I don’t see any point ranting and raving about it – and I suppose you could say it’s easy to say that now you’ve won. But that’s how we were at half time. It happened; we can’t change it. It’s unfortunate but these sort of things can cost people job but if it’s a league game and we lose because of a decision like that, maybe I’d be talking a little bit differently.’

It was key moment which might have deflated worse teams. But to their credit Leicester never folded after that decision and never played like a team whose primary focus must be the Premier League.

One-nil down and aggrieved they stuck to their task doggedly and on 83 minutes came the reward. When a corner fell to Schlupp, his attempted shot bounced off the feet of Leanardo Ulloa, but fell kindly for the Argentine who turned and shot from the edge of the box, beating Vorm and racing away in ecstatically to celebrate with the Leicester fans.

Still, few were expecting the dramatic denouement. Time added on had just been announced when Danny Simpson broke down the right. He crossed well and Schlupp met it cleanly but still, it remained a relatively simple save for Vorm. Somehow he allowed the ball to squirm under him and then deflected the ball into the net as he attempted to recover. Poor Vorm. Early on he had made fine saves but it would ultimately have been better for him if he had received that first-half red card.

As for Spurs the decision to make nine changes from the Capital One Cup semi final in midweek surely cost them. The introductions of Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane came too late and that of Emmanuel Adebayor was of limited impact and was greeted by some cheers but plenty of jeers among Tottenham fans. The manager claimed the changes were not the reason for the team’s exit but he now needs to lift them for the second leg against Sheffield United on Wednesday.

‘This is our way from the beginning of the season,’ said Pochettino. ‘I don’t think the changes are a reason to justify the result. We’re very disappointed and upset because when you analyse the game we deserved more. During the game we played well, but you need to kill the game and we always gave Leicester the possibility to stay alive.’

Pochettino has some justification in his claims – Spurs could have won this game but would have had more chance with Kane and Eriksen on from the start. And with Hugo Lloris in goal, they would not have lost.

Spurs did have to survive early scares – that Kramaric miss, which had seen Vorm react superbly to push the ball away and a dipping shot from Schlupp on 17 minutes which Vorm has tipped away one handed.

But slowly they established a stranglehold on the game, gradually crafting chances. They were presented with their opening goal from the penalty spot when Liam Moore was tricked into fouling Roberto Soldado, who flicked the ball away to one side while the Leicester defender simply ploughed on with his challenge regardless, taking out the Spaniard. Andros Townsend converted from the spot.

Thereafter Tottenham appeared in control without ever dominating. They had the best chances: a header from Soldado on 33 minutes; a strike from Paulinho on 35 minutes; Paulinho should have done better on 70 minutes; and 42-year-old debutant Mark Schwarzer produced an excellent save from Erik Lamela on 79 minutes before Leicester’s dramatic finale.
